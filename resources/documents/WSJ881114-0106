Ms. Duke says that by acting as so-called patient advocate for the hospital owner, she is keeping a &quot;foxhole promise&quot; she made years ago to help others if she conquered her own manic-depressive illness. The 42-year-old actress says therapy and a daily lithium regimen now enable her to lead a normal life.    Ms. Duke is the latest example of a celebrity who is using her own well-publicized disease -- and recovery -- to promote a hospital. Besides lending her name to this facility and making four therapy videotapes, Ms. Duke has agreed to make paid appearances at other hospitals owned by Psychiatric Institutes of America, a chain of 53 psychiatric hospitals. Neither Ms. Duke nor the chain will disclose her fee. (The Psychiatric Institutes chain is owned by Los Angeles-based National Medical Enterprises Inc., the nation's second largest for-profit health-care company.)    Many hospital executives are convinced that movie stars and sports heroes who have gone public with their personal sagas of alcoholism, drug abuse or other illnesses can break down the biggest barrier that keeps people who need help from getting it: the stigma attached to treatment. Ms. Duke &quot;is a role model for our patients,&quot; asserts Leon D. Bennett, administrator of the 80-bed Canyon Springs Hospital, which opened last month in the desert here near Palm Springs.    But critics decry celebrity endorsements in the health-care field as tasteless, risky and potentially dangerous. One of those potential dangers, they say, is that the celebrity could suffer a relapse. And that eventuality might cast a pall over the affiliated program, demoralizing those who have received similar treatment or discouraging the afflicted from getting help.    Joseph A. Pursch, a private physician who treated former first lady Betty Ford and the late Billy Carter, among other prominent people, urges his well-known patients to talk publicly about their problem because he believes that denial jeopardizes recovery. But he frowns on patients becoming &quot;financially involved and therefore hooked&quot; to a hospital.    &quot;It's outrageous,&quot; he says after hearing that an actress patient of his was paid a $12,500 fee to make a speech at a hospital opening. When someone is paid to say they got well on behalf of a business, that person is doing more than revealing the illness, he says; the person is expressing an opinion he isn't qualified to make about a professional service.    For her part, Ms. Duke says, &quot;I don't think I should have to lose money&quot; to represent the hospital. She adds: &quot;No one's room and bed charge is being raised to pay my fees.&quot;    Controversial or not, star marketing is a &quot;fast-growing trend that hospitals are getting hip to,&quot; says David Langness, vice president of the Hospital Council of Southern California. Part of the reason is that hospitals, especially those that specialize in treating behavioral or addiction problems, increasingly try to attract patients directly rather than rely on a more traditional and professionally acceptable source -- physician referrals. &quot;It's no longer enough to influence the doctor; you need the patient to drive himself in,&quot; says Ian Ferrier, president of McCann Healthcare Services Inc., a unit of McCann-Erickson Worldwide Inc.    Betty Ford was one of the first famous people to use a position of influence -- not on a paid basis -- to try to correct misconceptions about addiction. Now, by using celebrities in ads, hospitals have a new way to reach the public, says Jo Ellen Mistarz, an official of the American Hospital Association. And when actors advertise a clinic, Ms. Mistarz says, &quot;they believe they are contributing something that will make a difference to society.&quot; It's not like selling coffee, to which the actor may not be strongly committed, she says.    Former Olympic gymnast Cathy Rigby, now an actress and sports commentator, began making TV commercials nearly four years ago for an eating-disorder program run by College Hospitals, owned by College Health Enterprises Inc. in Huntington Beach, Calif. She recently made a videotape documentary of her 12-year bout with bulimia that will be sold by the hospital to retailers, schools and other outlets.    Ms. Rigby's contract also calls for her to make six appearances a year for the hospital. But the relationship goes much deeper, says Pat Motz, who directs the eating-disorder program. &quot;Cathy comes to some of our group-therapy sessions and says hello to patients and families she remembers,&quot; says Ms. Motz, who declines to give financial details of Ms. Rigby's relationship to the hospital.    Another Olympic star, Canadian figure skater Elizabeth Manley, came to the attention of a Utah hospital's marketing director during this year's Winter Games when a television commentator mentioned that the skater had suffered from depression as a teen-ager. &quot;What struck me is that she had an image that might appeal to younger kids as well as adults,&quot; says John Roake, the marketing director for Charter Canyon Hospital in Orem, Utah.    Mr. Roake got in touch with Ms. Manley's manager in Los Angeles, and the skater accepted a fee of $5,000 to make a TV spot for the hospital. A month later, an executive from the hospital's parent company, Charter Medical Corp. in Macon, Ga., called to negotiate rights and a bigger fee &quot;to use the commercial in 81 markets,&quot; Ms. Manley's manager says.    Comprehensive Care Corp., which operates chemical-dependency and psychiatric programs across the U.S., retained Billy Carter in July 1987 to speak at the opening of a hospital in Orlando, Fla. Former President Jimmy Carter's brother talked about his treatment for alcoholism in a company facility. The appearance was so successful that the company hired him half a dozen more times and named two treatment rooms after him and his wife, Sybil, before his death from cancer two months ago.    But Comprehensive Care has turned down offers from celebrities to appear in its television advertising. &quot;The celebrity could bring more damage to the program and to somebody else's recovery if they started drinking again,&quot; says Chris Jorgensen, vice president of communications.    Several years ago, Comprehensive Care was approached by retired Dallas Cowboy linebacker Thomas &quot;Hollywood&quot; Henderson after he underwent rehabilitation for cocaine abuse in a company facility. Comprehensive Care ultimately decided against using him as a spokesman out of fear that he might not stay straight. Six months later, Mr. Henderson was arrested and then spent two years in prison for cocaine possession and a sex offense involving a teen-age girl.    Since he was released two years ago, Mr. Henderson has appeared on the talk-show circuit to discuss his addiction and to promote his book, a candid autobiography called &quot;Out of Control.&quot; George W. Benedict, the owner of an alcohol- and substance-abuse hospital in Westhampton Beach, N.Y., saw Mr. Henderson on a television show last year and offered him a job as hospital outreach coordinator. Mr. Benedict says that Mr. Henderson &quot;and other people who have gained themselves a recovery through treatment&quot; will be appearing in commercials to further the hospital's plans to expand into other states.    &quot;We want to show that the disease is treatable,&quot; Mr. Benedict says. &quot;That is our message.&quot;    Patty Duke's message on behalf of Psychiatric Institutes of America is similar; and when she isn't spreading that word, she is writing and producing a film based on her autobiography, &quot;Call Me Anna.&quot; Having her personal and professional lives so intertwined isn't easy, she says, explaining: &quot;Now I have a national obligation and commitment to remain sane.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
