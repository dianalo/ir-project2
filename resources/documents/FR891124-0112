Background</ITAG>From the early 1960s through 1982, securities market trading increasedsteadily. Since 1982, a dramatic acceleration has occurred.\1\<NOTE/> For example, the volume of trading on the New York StockExchange (``NYSE`') during only two days in October 1987, October 19 and20 (1.2 billion shares), exceeded the annual NYSE trading volume for eachyear up to 1963. In addition, the aggregate NYSE trading volume for onlyfive days in October 1987, October 16-22 (2.4 billion shares), was equivalentto 21.3% of the NYSE`s annual volume for 1980 and 17.4% of its annual volume.\2\<NOTE/> The over-the-counter (``OTC'') and options markets also haveexperienced tremendous volume growth during the past decade.\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Trading volume dropped in 1988 to 40.8 billion shares,however, following an all-time high of 47.8 billion shares for 1987. Annualtrading volume for 1988 still was higher than in 1986, when 35.7 billionshares were traded. <T3>See </T3>New York Stock Exchange Fact Book (1989) at 71.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ <T3>Id.</T3><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ For example, the average daily share volume on NASDAQ,the primary OTC market, has grown from 11 million shares per day in 1978to 122.8 million shares per day in 1988, a 1,116% increase. <T3>See</T3> NASDAQ Fact Book (1988) at 7. In the standardized optionsmarket, contract volume for 1987 and 1988, in comparison to 1978, was,respectively, 497% and 319% larger. <T3>See</T3> SEC Monthly Statistical Review, April 1981 at 5 and February1989 at 4.Institutional investors and broker-dealers increasingly have employed tradingstrategies that involve the purchase or sale of a large number of stockssimultaneously (``basket trading'').\4\<NOTE/> These trading strategies have not only contributed to theincrease in trading volume noted above, but also ``the velocity and concentrationof stock trading.'' \5\<NOTE/> The events of Friday, October 13, 1989, when the Dow JonesIndustrial Average (``DJIA'') fell 165 points in little more than an hour,and on Tuesday, October 24, 1989, when the DJIA fell more than 60 pointsin 30 minutes, demonstrate that concentrated surges of trading volume canoccur. During the last hour of trading on October 13, 108,170,000 shareswere traded on the NYSE, for a daily total of 251,170,000 shares. On Monday,October 16, the DJIA fell more than 63 points in the first 40 minutes oftrading. More than 141 million shares were traded in the first hour, andmore tran 225 million shares were traded over the first two hours. Thetotal NYSE volume for the day was 416,493,810 shares, the fourth highestin NYSE history.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ <T3>See</T3> Division of Market Regulation, <T3>The October 1987 Market Break </T3>(Feb. 1988) ch. 1, at 1-7 for adescription of some of the basic trading strategies that employ baskettrading (``Market Break Study'').<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ <T3>Id. </T3>at 3-17.In order to accommodate this growth in trading activity and the volumesurges associated with basket trading strategies, the self-regulatory organizations(``SROs'') have replaced manually intensive order routing and executionprocedures with automated systems that permit electronic routing and executionof certain orders.\6\<NOTE/> These automated systems, which generally handle only smallorders, successfully have increased the capacity of U.S. securities marketsand have improved the efficiency and timeliness with which transactionsare executed.\7\<NOTE/> Indeed, the SROs have exercised foresight in anticipatingfuture volume levels and designing and continually monitoring and enhancingautomated systems to accommodate anticipated volume levels.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ Prior to the automation of the markets, orders to pourchaseor sell exchange-listed securities generally were processed in the followingmanner. A customer would place an order with his or her registered representativeat a branch office of a broker-dealer who, in turn, would telephone theorder to the broker-dealer's order desk. The order desk would then routethe order by telephone or pneumatic tube to the firm's trading booth onthe exchange floor and the firm's floor trader would take the order tothe applicable specialist post for execution. If the order was not executable(<T3>e.g., </T3>a non-marketable limit order), then it was given to thespecialist's and transcribed by hand onto the specialist's book for futureexecution. <T3>See </T3>Special Study of Securities Markets, Report of the Securitiesand Exchange Commission (1963), <T3>reprinted in </T3>H.R. Doc. No. 95, 88th Cong., 1st Sess. (1963), Pt.2 at 41-42 (``Special Study Report''), and Market Break Study, <T3>supra </T3>note 4, ch. 7 at 16. Orders for OTC securities were handledin a manner similar to exchange-listed securities except that once theyreached the broker-dealer's trading desk, they could be filled out of thefirm's inventory (principal transactions) or through telephone negotiationswith other broker-dealers (agency transactions). <T3>See </T3>Special Study Report, Pt. 2 at 552.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ The NYSE and the American Stock Exchange (``Amex'') havedeveloped automatic order routing systems, termed DOT and PER, respectively,that permit orders to be routed directly from member firm branch officesto the applicable specialist post, thereby by-passing the member firm'strading desk and floor broker. After orders are executed, DOT and PER generateand transmit execution reports to the member firms and other automatedsystems that disseminate market information. For a more complete descriptionof these systems and their enhancements, <T3>see </T3>Market Break Study, <T3>supra </T3>note 4, ch. 7 at 16-21 and 24-25. The Boston, Midwest, Pacific(``PSE''), and Philadelphia (``Phlx'') Stock Exchanges have developed systemscalled BEACON, MAX, SCOREX, and PACE, respectively, that automaticallyroute and execute small orders (generally up to 1,099 shares). These foursystems bassically operate in the same manner. After an order is routedto the system, it is priced based on the best bid or offer displayed onthe Intermarket Trading System (``ITS'') at the time the order was receivedby the system, and then routed to the applicable specialist post. The orderis then displayed on a video terminal at the post for 15 seconds to permitthe specialist and/or trading crowd to improve upon the assigned ITS executionprice. If no floor trader intervenes within the 15 seconds, the order isautomatically executed against the specialist at the predetermined price.Under the PACE system, however, orders are executed once priced and arenot displayed for price improvement. The four systems also transmit transactionreports to members and market data vendors. For a more complete descriptionof these systems, <T3>see </T3>Market Break Study, <T3>supra </T3>note 4, ch. 7 at 26-28 and Adkins andamp; Ruder, Appendixto ``Automation of Information and Trading in the U.S. Securities Market''at 6-13 (``Annenberg Forum Paper'') (paper presented by Chairman Ruderto the Annenberg Washington Program's 1989 Forum, ``Technology and FinancialMarkets,'' on February 27, 1989). <T3>See also </T3>``Automation in U.S. and Foreign Securities Markets:A Report by the Division of Market Regulation of the United States Securitiesand Exchange Commission'' (September 1989).<ITAG tagnum="28">The Amex and the Chicago Board Options Exchange (``CBOE'') have developedautomated order execution systems, termed RAES and Auto-Ex, respectively,for the execution of small public customer option orders. The Phlx hasdeveloped an automated order routing system for small customer optionsorders called Autom. In the OTC market, the national Association of SecuritiesDealers (``NASD'') has developed a system called the Small Order ExecutionSystem (``SOES'') that permits the automatic execution of small customerorders. For a more complete description of these systems, </ITAG><T3>see </T3>Market Break study, <T3>supra </T3>note 4, ch. 8 at 8-10 and ch. 9 at 12-13 and Appendix toAnnenberg Forum Paper, <T3>supra </T3>at 14-17 and 20-22.<ITAG tagnum="28">Finally, the Cincinnati Stock Exchange (``CSE'') has established afully automated electronic trading system, National Securities TradingSystem (``NSTS''), that permits CSE members, without having to maintaina physical presence on the CSE floor, to enter agency or principal ordersinto the system through remote terminals. Once entered, orders are stored,queued, and executed by the system according to price and time priorities.Public agency orders, however, are granted priority over other orders atthe same price, regardless of time of entry. The screens for each securitytraded in the system are updated instantaneously to reflet the entry, revision,cancellation and execution of orders.</ITAG>The increase in trading volume noted above also has had a ripple effecton the degree of automation of other SRO functions auxiliary to order execution.Specifically, the SROs have developed and continue to enhance automatedsystems for the dissemination of transaction and quotation information\8\<NOTE/> and the comparison of trades prior to settlement.\9\<NOTE/> These systems, in conjunction with automated trading systems,allow investors to receive and act on market information in a timely fashionand ensure that trades are settled in an accurate and efficient manner.The Commission commends the SROs for their efforts to develop and constantlyimprove these systems.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ Through a coordinated and cooperative effort, SROs developedthe Consolidated Transaction Reporting System and the Consolidated QuotationReporting System in 1974 and 1978, respectively. These systems providefor the electronic collection and dissemination of real-time trade andquotation information (<T3>i.e.</T3>, immediately or soon after the event, rather than at theend of the trading day) in NYSE and Amex listed securities, as well ascertain regional securities. Under these plans, quotation and trade reportsare submitted by particular markets electronically to a central processor,the Securities Information Automation Corporation (``SIAC''). SIAC, inturn, processes this information and broadcasts it to financial informationvendors for dissemination to investors. For options, transaction and quotationinformation is collected and disseminated pursuant to a plan administeredby the Options Price Reporting Authority (``OPRA''). As with equity securities,each options exchange electronically collects and transmits to OPRA lastsale information and bids and offers for the options that it trades. OPRA,in turn, processes this information and disseminates it to vendors. Inthe OTC market, NASDAQ, Inc., a subsidiary of the NASD, operates a systemthat collects quotations that are electronically submitted by market makersfrom computer terminals in their offices and then disseminates them tovendors and other market makers. For the largest and most actively tradedNASDAQ companies, which are known as NASDAQ/NMS securities, the NASD providesreal-time last sale reports.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ Trade comparison, the matching of the buy and sell sidesof a securities transaction, is the process after a trade has been executedby which broker-dealers confirm with each other the trade's terms (<T3>e.g.</T3>, security, number of units, and price) and the existenceof a contract. Comparison is the first of three basic steps in processinga securities transaction, the other two being clearance and settlement.For a more complete discussion of trade comparison, see Market Break Study,<T3>supra</T3> note 4., ch. 10 at 1-5.<ITAG tagnum="28">The NASD has developed a system, called Automated Confirmation Transaction(``ACT''), that facilitates the automated clearing of pre-negotiated trades.</ITAG><T3>See</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26991 (June 29, 1989),54 FR 28531. ACT is a facility for same-day comparison of inter-dealer,over-the-counter equity trades. Participants must enter trade reports withinspecific time frames, which are then compared and submitted to clearingas matched, ``locked-in'' trades. The NASD also has introduced a systemcalled the Order Confirmation Transaction (``OCT'') System. <T3>See</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 25263 (January 11, 1988),53 FR 1430. OCT permits negotiation through screen terminals of tradesof all sizes between market makers, and brokers and the automated, locked-incomparison of those trades once agreed upon. The system in effect replacestelephone negotiation with negotiation through computer links and screen.If an order is accepted, the system generates locked-in comparison reports,as well as publicly-disseminated trade reports.<ITAG tagnum="28">The NYSE and the National Securities Clearing Corporation (``NSCC'')recently have developed an automated comparison system called the OvernightComparison System (``OCS''). This system, which is being implemented instages, consists of two subsystems, called the Correction System and theComparison Redesign System. The Correction System computerizes the NYSE'sprocessing of uncompared trades. The Exchange's Correction System beganoperation on April 27, 1989, and by July 18, 1989, all uncompared or ``QuestionedTrades'' were being resolved through the System. </ITAG><T3>See</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 27096 (August 3, 1989),54 FR 33299. The Comparison Redesign System permits all transactions tobe compared or closed out by the close of the business day following tradedate, T+1, as required by new NYSE Rule 130.While the SROs' development of execution, market information and comparisonsystems substantially has improved the efficiency of their markets, theOctober 1987 Market Break exposed the continuing vulnerability of thesesystems to operational problems during extreme high volume periods. Thefollowing problems were among those encountered by automated trading systemsduring the October 1987 Market Break. First, inadequate computer capacitycaused queues of unprocessed orders to develop that, in turn, resultedin significant delays in order execution.\1\\0\<NOTE/> Second, the SROs did not have adequate contingency plansto free-up or create additional computer-file space to accommodate theincrease in order traffic.\1\\1\<NOTE/> Third, delays were experienced by some SROs in the transmissionof transaction reports to both member firms and market information disseminationsystems. Fourth, delays in order processing caused the expiration of ITScommitments to trade before they reached the applicable specialist post.Finally, due in large part to capacity strains, some SROs lowered the order-eligibilitysize of their systems or asked member firms not to route orders throughtheir systems. The disengagement of these systems, in turn, hampered orderexecution throughout the market as a whole, because orders that would otherwisehave been processed electronically were required to be processed manually.\1\\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\ In some cases, the queuing problems adversely affectedthe priority of orders placed in the system. For instance, in one system,once an order file was full, incoming orders would replace, or ``wrap-over,''orders previously placed in the system.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\1\ While some of the markets, such as the MSE, were ableto make certain adjustments in their systems to continue operations, twomarkets, the PSE and the Phlx, asked members to refrain from using theirautomated systems for several periods of time during the week of October29, 1987, because the systems were overloaded. <T3>See </T3>Market Break Study, <T3>supra </T3>note 4, ch. 7 at 15-41. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\2\ The OTC and options markets' automated execution systems,however, did not experience operational strains during the market break,in part because order flow was diverted from these systems for reasonsunrelated to the operation of the computer facilities themselves. For amore thorough discussion of the problems encountered by these markets,<T3>see </T3>Market Break Study, <T3>supra </T3>note 4, at chs. 7-9. With regard to trade comparison systems,the number of uncompared trades on all securities markets increased substantially,thereby placing great stress on the clearance and settlement process. Thiswas not, however, a systems capacity problem, except for the NYSE's odd-lotsystem, the Automated Pricing and Reporting Service (``APARS''). APARSreports were delayed significantly on October 20 and 21, 1987, and thesystem as a whole experienced problems on October 20 when no member odd-lottrades were reported to NSCC (however, those trades were reported the nextday and were entered into NSCC's clearance systems without further effecton timely settlements). APARS also experienced capacity overload problemson October 20, which caused a computer failure and, in switching over toa backup computer, loss of approximately 8,000 to 9,000 orders. The losttrades were re-established through the NYSE's trade correction process.<T3>See id. </T3>ch. 10 at 5-12. In December 1987, the Commission approveda NYSE rule change that modified pricing procedures for standard odd-lotmarket orders. The APARS system was eliminated, and standard odd-lots noware routed through the Exchange's Limit Order File (``LMT''). <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 25177 (December 7, 1987),54 FR 47472. Finally, there were delays at several of the regional exchangesin transmitting trade information to the Securities Industry AutomationCorporation (``SIAC''). See <T3>id</T3>. ch. 7 at 3-7. The market decline on October 13, 1989, demonstrated that the systems workedsubstantially better than two years ago, but there were still problemswith some systems. A few of the exchanges again experienced queuing problems,while some exchanges had other systems problems that may or may not havebeen related to the volume surge during that volatile period.\1\\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\3\ Not surprisingly, those exchanges that had conductedprior testing of their automated systems seemed to fare better than thosethat had not.The NASD experienced problems with SOES. On October 16, trading on SOEStotaled 13,483 transactions and 4.7 million shares. A variety of factors,such as mandatory participation in SOES, the penalties for market-makerwithdrawals, and the efforts of market-makers to unlock and uncross theirmarkets, resulted in an unprecedented flow of market-maker quotation changesto NASDAQ. As a preliminary matter, it appears that this may have produceda communications delay between the computers that operate the basic NASDAQSystem and the computers that operate SOES, causing orders to be executedbased on delayed quotations.\1\\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\4\ Apparently, the computer receiving quote updates wasso fast that the computer could not read and send the quotes to the computerwhich processes executions. Therefore, the computer or the link was shutoff for approximately 20 minutes from 9:38 to 10:04 am.The effect of the earthquake in Northern California on the PSE during theweek of October 16-20, 1989, demonstrates the vulnerability of the securitiesmarkets to external circumstances. The earthquake and the resultant lossof power caused the PSE in San Francisco to substantially scale down operationsuntil October 23, 1989.\1\\5\<NOTE/> To ensure that trading in PSE options could continue, theCommission permitted trading in PSE options on the American, New York,and Philadelphia Stock Exchanges and the Chicago Board Options Exchange,on October 19-20.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\ The equities floor in San Francisco remained open ona limited basis with orders being routed to and executed in Los Angeles,while some workers at the PSE's main floor in San Francisco executed ordersby flashlight. W.S.J. Oct. 19, 1989 at C14.In addition, on November 10, 1989, the NYSE delayed opening until 10:30a.m. due to an electrical fire in the building that houses SIAC, causingthe NYSE to rely on its back-up generators. The options and futures marketsalso halted trading during that period.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Automation Review Policy </ITAG>Because of the impact systems failures have on public investors, broker-dealerrisk exposure, and market efficiency, the Commission believes it is appropriatefor the SROs to take certain steps to ensure that their automated systems\1\\6\<NOTE/> have the capacity to accommodate current and reasonably anticipatedfuture trading volume levels adequately and to respond to localized emergencyconditions. For this reason, the Commission today announces its AutomationReview Policy (``Policy'').\1\\7\<NOTE/> It is the Commission's belief that the SROs should establishcomprehensive planning and assessment programs to test systems capacityand vulnerability. These programs should have three primary objectives.First, the Commission believes the SROs should formally establish currentand future capacity estimates (``Capacity Estimates'') for their automatedorder routing and execution, market information, and trade comparison systems.Second, the SROs should conduct capacity stress tests (``Stress Tests''),periodically, to determine the behavior of automated systems under a varietyof simulated conditions.\1\\8\<NOTE/> Third, we believe that the SROs should contract with independentreviewers to assess annually whether these systems can perform adequatelyat their estimated current and future estimated capacity levels and whetherthese systems have adequate protection against physical threat.\1\\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\ The Commission believes that the Policy Statement isconsistent with and in furtherance of Sections 2 and 11A(a)(1) (B) and(C) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Specifically, Section 2 statesin pertinent part that ``transactions in securities as commonly conductedupon securities exchanges and over-the-counter markets are affected witha national public interest which makes it necessary to provide for regulationand control of such transactions and of practices and matters related thereto,. . . to require appropriate reports, to remove impediments to and perfectthe mechanisms of a national market system for securities and a nationalsystem for the clearance and settlement of securities transactions andthe safeguarding of securities and funds related thereto, and to imposerequirements necessary to make such regulation and control reasonably completeand effective, . . .'' In Section 11A(a)(1), Congress found that: (1) ``securitiesmarkets are an important national asset which must be preserved and strengthened'';(2) ``new data processing and communications techniques create the opportunityfor more efficient and effective market operations''; and (3) ``it is inthe public interest and appropriate for the protection of investors andthe maintenance of fair and orderly markets to assure . . . [the] economicallyefficient execution of securities transactions.''<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\ The Commission notes that compliance with this policystatement by the SROs is voluntary. The Commission's examination program,however, will review carefuly the preparedness of SRO systems to handlesubstantial volume spikes. If the Commission becomes concerned over thelevel of voluntary compliance with this Policy Statement, it may proposea rule that would place an affirmative obligation on the SROs to obtaina periodic review of their automated systems.<ITAG tagnum="28">While this Policy Statement does not directly discuss the obligationsof broker dealers, proprietary trading systems, service bureaus, and vendors,the Commission believes all should engage in systems testing, and thisPolicy Statement should be used as a guideline. The Commission staff willreview these entities' systems preparedness in the coming months and, ifappropriate, the Commission may consider the issuance of a second PolicyStatement thereafter.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\ We note that, in fact, the SROs already have beguna testing program. For example, on Saturday, April 30, 1988, the NYSE andSIAC tested the key computer systems that experienced difficulties in October1987. During the test the participants replayed actual data from October19, 1987, compressed into five hours (8:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m.) to achievethe peak volumes required to stress the systems. Beginning at 8:00 a.m.,incoming market orders were accepted into the Opening Automatic ReportingSystem (``OARS'') and limit orders were sent to display books and cardprinters. At 9:30 a.m., specialist personnel opened the ``market'' andsimulated normal (but intense) trading activity by reporting executionsand entering additional order from the floor.<ITAG tagnum="28">The NYSE reported that the test showed that the improvements madesince October 19 (for example, expanding the trading floor, adding input/outputdevices, greatly increasing the use of display books, and upgrading hardwareand software) have resulted in higher capacity, increased flexibility andbetter performance. The NYSE's systems processed a traffic flow comparableto that of October 19, 1987, in much less time and at much higher messagerates. </ITAG><T3>See </T3>Report from NYSE and SIAC, 600-Million-Share-Day Volume andStress Test on April 30, 1988 (May 23, 1988).<ITAG tagnum="28">On Saturday, November 12, 1988, the NYSE and SIAC, in conjunctionwith the member-firm community and the financial service vendors, testedthe Exchange's switching and order-processing systems. The test, accordingto the report of the NYSE and SIAC, met its five objectives. Specifically,it:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">1. proved that the Common Message Switch (CMS) interface to memberfirms can accommodate message rates up to those expected on a 600-million-shareday;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">2. demonstrated that member firms can deliver orders to and receivereports from the NYSE at 600-million-share-day message rates;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">3. identified potential weak lines when many systems were stressedat rates in excess of 600-million-share-day levels; collected extensiveinformation about systems' behavior under heavy loads;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">4. used the market-data systems to distribute trade and quote datato financial-service vendors in preparation for the 1989 test; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">5. helped NYSE/SIAC identify requirements for system tools and proceduresto conduct similar tests routinely.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">Report from NYSE and SIAC, 600-Million-Share-Day Member-Firm InterfaceTest on November 12, 1988 (December 16, 1988).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">The 1989 tests focused on the National Market System (``NMS''), andconsisted of three phases. On Saturday, May 13, 1989, NYSE and SIAC, withthe cooperation of other market centers, conducted a vendor test. The NYSEand SIAC reported that the May test successfully transmitted test marketdata, previously recorded, from all market-center sources to the financial-servicevendors and that the test met its two objectives by:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">1. distributing trade and quote data to the vendor community at 600-million-share-dayrates to test vendors' ability to receive and process at these rates; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">2. identifying the SIAC and vendor tools needed to conduct similartests routinely.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">Report from NYSE and SIAC, 600-Million-Share-Day Financial ServiceVendor Test on May 13, 1989 (June 9, 1989).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">On June 24, 1989, a stress test was conducted to examine the ConsolidatedTrading and Consolidated Quote Systems.

Discussion</ITAG>The Commission believes this Policy Statement is consistent with and infurtherance of a Congressional finding that one of the two paramount objectivesof a national market system is ``the maintenance of stable and orderlymarkets with maximum capacity for absorbing trading imbalances withoutundue price movements.'' \2\\0\<NOTE/> In light of the operational difficulties experienced by SROautomated systems during the October 1987 Market Break, predicted futurecapacity requirements based on past increases in trading volume, the needto maintain accurate trade and quote information, and the degree to whichcomputer automation has become, and is likely to increase as, an integralpart of securities trading, the Commission believes that the SROs shouldtake certain steps to ensure that their automated systems have adequatecapacity to process reasonably predictable volume levels.\2\\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\0\ Senate Comm. on Banking, Housing andamp; Urban Affairs,<T3>Report to Accompany S. 249,</T3> S.

Moreover,because lack of adequate communications capacity can be as damaging tothe overall performance of an exchange during peak periods as poorly designedorder processing, capacity tests of the data networks that feed the computersystems also should be conducted.The Commission's announcement of these guidelines does not mean the Commissionbelieves SRO automated systems are inadequate or that enhancements madeto these systems since the October 1987 Market Break have not been sufficientor beneficial. On the contrary, the Commission believes the SROs have madegreat strides since October 1987 to increase the capacity of their systemsand the Commission is encouraged that planned enhancements to these systemswill further strengthen the integrity of the securities markets.\2\\2\<NOTE/> The Commission does believe, however, that a periodic reviewand test of each SRO's systems capacity will help indentify potential weakpoints and reduce the risk of serious system failures. The Commission'sPolicy reflects its desire to ensure that market movements are the resultof market participants' changing expectations about the direction of themarket for a particular security, or group of securities, and not the resultof investor confusion or panic resulting from operational failures or delaysin SRO automated trading or market information systems.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\2\ <T3>See</T3> Letter from David S. Ruder, Chairman, SEC, to the HonorableWilliam Proxmire, Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairsdated March 4, 1988 (discussing contingency planning and coordination andoperational capacity enhancements).The Commission believes that each SRO should formulate current CapacityEstimates for the maximum number of transactions its order handling andexecution systems can process daily without unreasonable delays, the maximumnumber of transactions its system can handle over a fifteen-minute surgein volume, and future capacity requirements based on projected volume figures.\2\\3\<NOTE/> Similarly, the Commission believes that the SROs should formulatedaily and fifteen-minute Capacity Estimates for their automated marketinformation and trade comparison systems, along with future Capacity Estimates.In addition, the SROs should formulate contingency protocols (``ContingencyProtocols'')\2\\4\<NOTE/> designed to provide back-up facilities in the event of on-linesystem failures and additional processing capacity during high volume periods.\2\\5\<NOTE/> Furthermore, the SROs should prepare an evaluation of anyimplementation of system enhancements needed to accommodate future tradinglevels. The SROs should consider preparing planning statements anticipatingsuch enhancements (``Planning Statements''). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\3\ Future capacity estimates also should take into considerationincreased message traffic resulting from planned modifications to existingsystems or the introduction of new systems. For example, if the NYSE wereto expand the instances where DOT automatically would execute orders orif the CBOE were to increase the order eligibility size for RAES, thenthey would have to incorporate the anticipated increase in order flow intotheir capacity estimates. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\4\ A contingency protocol is a plan to deal with extrememarket conditions which potentially could overburden automated order routingand execution systems. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\5\ The Commission understands that many of the SROs alreadyhave produced similar capacity estimates, planning statements, and protocolsthat they will be able to use them to comply with this Policy. The SROs also should institute procedures to continue periodic Stress Testsof all of their automated systems and report the results of those teststo the Division. The SROs should use standards generally set by the computerindustry to develop, and evaluate the results of, Stress Tests and shouldspecify in their report the specific standards they are applying. In thisconnection, the Commission requests comments on whether the Commissionshould in the future mandate specific standards, and if so, what thosestandards should be. The Commission also requests that the SROs periodically assess the vulnerabilityof their automated systems to external and internal threat (``VulnerabilityStudies''). The Commission believes that such studies should address thesusceptibility of automated systems to computer viruses, unauthorized use,computer vandalism, and failures as a result of catastrophic events (<T3>i.e.</T3>, fire, power outages, earthquakes). In addition, the Commissionrequests that the SROs promptly notify the Division of any instances inwhich unauthorized persons gained or attempted to gain access to theirsystems, and follow-up with a written report of the problem, its problem,its cause, and the steps taken to prevent a recurrence. The Commission believes that review of SRO actions relating to automationsystems will be important in monitoring SRO performance. Accordingly, theCommission, pursuant to its oversight authority, expects to request thatthe SROs provide to the Division Capacity Estimates, Planning Statements,Stress Tests, Contingency Protocols, Vulnerability Studies, and reportsof any incidents of unauthorized access which they have prepared. Finally, as part of a capacity planning and assessment program, SRO automatedsystems also should receive, periodically, a comprehensive, critical, andindependent review. The Capacity Estimates, Planning Statements, StressTests, Contingency Protocols, and Vulnerability Studies previously producedby the SROs, along with the actual automated systems themselves, shouldform the basis on which independent reviewers will be able to critiqueautomated systems.\2\\6\<NOTE/> The Commission believes that each SRO should have its automatedsystems reviewed annually by an independent reviewer starting in 1991.\2\\7\<NOTE/> Pursuant to its oversight examination authority, the Commissionexpects to request the SROs to provide the Commission copies of the reports,which have been prepared, describing the findings of the independent reviewer.\2\\8\<NOTE/> Areas which appear approprate for independent review include:(1) Whether current and future SRO Capacity Estimates are accurate; (2)whether the automated systems can perform at estimated capacity levels;(3) whether planned system enhancements realistically will accommodatefuture capacity requirements; (4) whether Contingency Protocols are welldesigned and likely to be effective; (5) whether SRO automated systemsare vulnerable to systems integrity failures; and (6) recommendations toaddress deficiencies found in areas (1)-(5) above.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\6\ In the future, the Commission may suggest expansionof this Policy to other SRO computer-driven support systems for, amongother things, clearance and settlement, and market surveillance, if theCommission finds it necessary to ensure the maintenance of fair and orderlymarkets. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\7\ In view of the voluntary nature of this Policy, theCommission has not mandated specific requirements for determining whethera reviewer is independent. The Commission, however, requests comments onwhether it should mandate such standards in the future, and if so, whatthose standards should be. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\8\ In addition, the Commission requests that each SROinclude a general discussion of its automation review in its Exchange ActForm 1-A submitted annually to the Commission. <ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: November 16, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">By the Commission. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan G.
