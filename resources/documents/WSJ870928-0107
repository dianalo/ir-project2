Negotiations were never a certainty because the two sides have differed so sharply in the past on how such quotas should be allocated. But discussions that started last week are due to resume today on a producer proposal to boost green coffee prices by reimposing export quotas that have been suspended since February 1986. Industry specialists say they see few major signs of discord so far.    &quot;No one, particularly the producing nations, wants to be responsible for this meeting breaking up with no agreement,&quot; a U.S. green coffee dealer who is attending the London meetings said.    The incentive is clear. Shortly before export quotas were suspended, coffee prices were as high as $2.76 a pound in the wake of drought damage in Brazil, the world's largest producer. From that level, prices plunged below $1 a pound in March before recovering recently on the possibility of new quotas. On Friday, coffee for December delivery rose 2.01 cents a pound to $1.1479 on the Coffee, Sugar andamp; Cocoa Exchange in New York.    But even if export quotas are reimposed, coffee prices are expected to rise only slightly in the short term, until the large supply of green coffee in consuming countries is absorbed. The supply was built up recently as producing countries shipped as much coffee as possible ahead of a possible reimposition of quotas. The supply in the U.S. is estimated at about five million bags, and the amount is believed to be substantial in Europe as well.    Relatively little coffee will be shipped to consuming countries between now and the end of the year, when coffee currently being harvested in Central America will come on the market. This will give roasters time to reduce their accumulation of supplies. Prices are likely to rise when those supplies are reduced and roasters reenter the market, but the size of that price rise isn't clear yet.    If no agreement on quotas is reached, &quot;there will be little to keep prices from dropping,&quot; one analyst says. Producers could seek to prevent a price plunge by agreeing to hold supplies off the market, but it's uncertain how long they could sustain any such move.    Previous efforts last September and in February of this year failed to bring an agreement on restoring export quotas. The deadlock came over demands by the U.S. and other coffee-consuming nations for a more equitable allotment of quotas to smaller producers.    The U.S. wants to devise a formula that takes into account what it calls objective criteria such as each country's historical coffee production and exports.    Brazil has fought the proposed change because the formula could cut Brazil's world market share, currently about 30%. It prefers the old system, which basically consisted of coffee producers getting together and deciding who gets what. As the world's largest producer, Brazil has had considerable influence over such decisions.    The producers' current quota plan would increase the share given to some producers, mostly in Central America, while Brazil would take a slight cut and African producers a deeper reduction.    The quotas generally are acceptable to consumer countries, trade sources said, and they do incorporate objective criteria. What consumer countries would like to know is how the producers arrived at the quotas and what formulas they used.    Jon Rosenbaum, head of the U.S. delegation to the London talks, wouldn't make a prediction on whether an agreement is in prospect.    &quot;At the moment, I don't know if we can come up with something that will have the broad support of both consumers and producers alike,&quot; he said. However, he said: &quot;The willingness of producers to negotiate is a positive sign. If they hadn't been, the viability of the meeting would have been seriously in question.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
