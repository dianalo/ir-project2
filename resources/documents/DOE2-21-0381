However,using measures that save energy dollars for new or existing buildingscan result in the reduction of both energy consumption and energy costsin excess of those associated with the energy consumed. The key oftenlies in the utility's rate structures for commercial buildings, whichreflect both energy use and demand charges. To determine how utilityrate structures affect decisions about renewable resource strategies,the design/analysis team needs to understand the building's energy usecharacteristics. Furthermore, to determine the correct size of an activesolar heating and/or cooling system, and its performance once properlysized, monthly or annual building heating and cooling loads (those imposedon the building plant) are needed. This chapter generally characterizesthe energy end-use patterns in commercial buildings and then presentsmethods for estimating energy use, and the resulting energy costs, inthese buildings. Finally, several levels of building load and energy-usecalculation methods and computer programs are presented. 7 figures, 12tables.</TEXT></DOC>
