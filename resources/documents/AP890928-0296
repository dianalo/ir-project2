Thursday announced a double-prongedprogram that will cut its work force by about 15 percent andsubstantially shrink its dairy business, symbolized for decades byElsie the cow.   The program, which will mean the cutting of 7,000 jobs, comesafter several years of acquisitions, which added $3.1 billion toBorden's annual sales.   Under the plan announced at a New York news conference, Bordenwill take a $571 million pre-tax charge against its third-quarterincome, resulting in a quarterly loss of $300 million to $305million and a loss of $47 million to $58 million for the full year.   The one-time charge, amounting to about $404 million aftertaxes, will be used to consolidate Borden's six business lines. Thegoal is to cut costs and boost pre-tax profit by some $340 millionthrough 1993.   Borden _ which also is a leader in the pasta, wall coverings andglue businesses _ also intends to pull out of overcrowded dairymarkets and concentrate on those where it has been doing well.Borden says it will retain its ranking as the world's biggest dairybusiness even after it reduces its operations by a third, or by$700 million to $750 in annual sales.   Romeo J. Ventres, Borden's chairman and chief executive officer,said 65 of the company's 265 plants worldwide will be closed orsold over the next two to three years.   Ventres said the plants to be closed and the dairy markets to beexited will be identified later. Borden's weaker markets generallyare in the East and Southeast and the stronger ones are in theSouth and West, Ventres said.   He said Borden would make every effort to sell the plants asgoing concerns and local management will be given the first crackat buying them.   Borden's program will reduce its worldwide employment by about7,000 from the present 46,000. Employees will be notified inadvance of closings and job retraining will be offered to anyonewanting it, the company said.   Twenty of the closings will involve dairy plants and branches tobe sold or closed in non-growth areas.   Ventres said Borden will remain committed to dairy markets whereit enjoys strong growth.   ``We're very committed to Elsie,'' he said. ``You may sayElsie's gone on a little diet here ... but she'll be with us,''Ventres said referring to the cow that has been a symbol for Bordensince she was introduced at the 1939 World's Fair in New York.   Borden's exhibit depicted a dairy of the future featuring Elsiein a barnyard boudoir. Her mate, Elmer the bull, made his debut atthe following year's fair and filled the job of ``spokesman'' forBorden's adhesives.   Outside of dairy, many of the planned closings will involvesmaller or older plants where production will be shifted to larger,more modern ones.   Securities analysts were unsurprised by Borden's restructuringplans, given that the company had been on an ambitious acquisitioncampaign. Borden has acquired 77 businesses since 1986, mostly inthe food and consumer products area, that added $3.1 billion toannual sales.   Borden stock rose $2.25 to $36.75 a share on the New York StockExchange.   Some analysts regard Borden as a hodgepodge of businesses thatmight do better disengaged. In retrospect, a few analysts said,Borden should have set aside money for consolidations while it wason its buying spree.   A typical Wall Street comment came from William Leach ofDonaldson Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Inc. He said: ``It'sdefinitely a good thing,'' but he added, ``I'm not jumping up anddown.''   Ventres said the goal of the consolidation in dairy and itsother planned moves is to make Borden a low-cost producer in eachof its six main businesses by 1992.   Borden says it is the world's leading producer in pasta, dairy,wallcoverings and forest products adhesives. It claims to be No.2in salty snacks.   Some of Borden's best-known brands include Wise chips andsnacks, such as Cheez Doodles, Eagle Brand dairy products, Catellipasta and Classico tomato sauce. It also makes Elmer's Glue andvarious paints and varnishes.</TEXT></DOC>
