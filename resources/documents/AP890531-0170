Police said four jets fired six rockets at a cluster ofPalestinian bases east of Sidon, provincial capital of southLebanon at 7 p.m.   A two-story command post used by three radical guerrillafactions was demolished, they said, and at least five guerrillaswere missing and presumed dead. Nine guerrillas were wounded, thepolice reported.   Six F-4 fighter-bombers fired eight rockets at bases of thepro-Iranian Shiite militia Hezbollah in the Bekaa Valley ofsoutheast Lebanon at 7:15 p.m., according to the police report.   A spokesman said Hezbollah's headquarters in Suhmor village eastof Mashgara was destroyed, along with a nearby ammunition dump anda garage used to repair guerrilla vehicles.   He said several Israeli helicopter gunships hovered over thebases near Sidon more than two hours after the raid.   ``They dropped parachute flares that lit the night sky asguerrillas were searching with torchlights for the missing victimsunder the rubble,'' he said. ``We don't know if the helicoptersalso bombed.''   The Israeli air raids were the fifth and sixth inside Lebanonthis year. By police count, six people were killed and 45 woundedin the four previous attacks.   In Jerusalem, the Israeli army command said the jets hit ``twoterrorist targets,'' east of Sidon and east of Mashgara in theBekaa.   It described the targets as ``headquarters and ammunition dumpsof Hezbollah and Abu Nidal'' at which infiltrations were planned.   Lebanese police said the bases east of Sidon belonged to thePopular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, the FatahRevolutionary Council led by terrorist Abu Nidal and the PalestineLiberation Front.   The three organizations have joint bases in hills facingpositions of the Israeli-sponsored South Lebanon Army militia inKfar Falous, six miles east of Sidon, the spokesman said. Themilitia helps patrol the ``security zone'' Israel maintains onLebanese territory just north of its border.   An Israeli army spokesman said earlier that Israeli troops shotand killed three guerrillas near the Lebanese village of Hula,about a mile from the Israeli border town of Kiryat Shmona.   Two other encounters between Israeli soldiers and guerrillaswere reported in the area Sunday and Tuesday, ending a two-monthlull in attempted infiltrations of Israel from Lebanon.</TEXT></DOC>
