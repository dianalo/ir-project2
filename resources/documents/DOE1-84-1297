Essentially three types of legal exposure may develop: regulatoryviolations, where the regulator lays charges against an accused undera specific piece of legislation, special statutory remedies which becomeavailable in certain instances, e.g., spills in Ontario, and normal common-lawactions, i.e. nuisance suits, liability for damage to others as resultof discharge or escape of a dangerous substance, trespass, riparian rights,and negligence. Practical steps that can be taken to minimize legal exposureare described. These include insurance, establishing of a complianceprogram, periodic and objective reviews of facility operations and practicesfrom an environmental or worker exposure perspective, identificationof those operational segments most susceptible to PCB spills and developmentof scenarios and procedures for dealing with such accidents, examinationof shipper-consignee contracts to see where passing of title to any PCB-relatedshipment occurs, examining supplier warranties on pollution abatementequipment or workplace control eqipment, examining the steps that mightbe appropriate if the organization becomes the object of a PCB-relatedinvestigation, minimizing liability by corporate restructuring, and developingor revising employee idenficiation programs.</TEXT></DOC>
