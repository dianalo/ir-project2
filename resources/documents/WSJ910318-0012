The move effectively deflates an attempt by MicrosoftCorp. to take charge of the emerging market for these&quot;multimedia&quot; machines, and further illustrates the hostilitythat has built up against the software company in recentmonths.</LP><TEXT>   But consultants said the rebellion against Microsoft mayalso slow the introduction of technologies as many morecompanies must now agree on what standards are needed.   The industry group is a nonprofit organization known asthe Interactive Multimedia Association. Founded in 1988 as atrade group that specialized in video-disk technology, it nowincludes more than 170 members from diverse fields, includingIBM, Sony Corp., N.V. Philips, and Intel Corp.   Today's announcement will draw an even wider group ofsupporters, including heavy-hitters such as Apple, LotusDevelopment Corp., NCR Corp., and multimedia pioneerMacromind Inc. IMA President Richard Thackray said he expects250 or more companies to pledge money and support for its newinitiatives.   Mr. Thackray said the IMA will develop specifications forprograms that would run on a number of standard, IMA-defined&quot;classes,&quot; or combinations of hardware and software. Oneclass might be the Apple Macintosh computer; another might beIBM-compatible computers that run Microsoft's Windows programand are equipped with compact-disk drives.   Initially, such specifications would make it easier todevelop multimedia programs for each platform. Eventually,Mr. Thackray said, he hopes to merge as many of the standardsas possible, allowing programs to run on many differentcomputers.   Microsoft has already announced its own set of multimediaspecifications. But late Friday the company said it will alsojoin the IMA, and denied any conflict with the newly powerfulgroup. Microsoft promised to be one of the main speakers attoday's IMA announcement, which will be made at a bigmultimedia conference in San Jose, Calif.   &quot;We think the IMA is doing great things for themultimedia industry,&quot; said Rob Glaser, general manager ofMicrosoft's multimedia systems group. &quot;I don't think it'sadversarial in any way.&quot;   Industry experts disagreed, citing a growing sentiment inthe PC industry that Microsoft has accumulated too muchinfluence. &quot;It's clear that IBM and the other companieswanted to get Microsoft out of the driver's seat,&quot; said NickArnett, president of Multimedia Computing Corp., a consultingcompany based in Santa Clara, Calif.   Mr. Arnett said IBM led the push to create a strongindustry group, even soliciting rivals, such as Apple andNCR. But IBM said the IMA came to it for support, and itmerely endorsed a good idea. Mr. Thackray would say only thatthere was truth to the idea that the IMA initiative wasinspired by Microsoft's actions.   Last November, Microsoft proposed with much publicity aminimum PC configuration that would be used to run multimediaprograms, which are increasingly being used in education,training and entertainment. At the time, seven big computermakers -- including Tandy Corp. and American Telephone andamp;Telegraph Co. -- lined up behind the Microsoft standard.Analysts praised the accord as a breakthrough, and a victoryfor Microsoft.   IBM didn't join that bandwagon, saying it wouldn't endorsea single standard setup. Instead, IBM said it would work withMicrosoft to change the basic software that controls PCs, somore machines could handle sound and pictures effectively.   The new consensus doesn't mean that any of that work willbe abandoned: Messrs. Glaser and Thackray said they expectIMA standards will reflect Microsoft's efforts in its&quot;class.&quot; But now Microsoft won't be calling the shots, andindustry standards will extend beyond the class it defined.   &quot;There can't just be one configuration that's important,&quot;said Michael Braun, vice president for multimedia at IBM. &quot;Weneed a strong, open forum to discuss these issues. Everyonewants a voice in this.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
