Eddie Hatcher, 31, was acquitted of federal hostage-taking andweapons charges in connection with Feb. 1 incident, in which up to20 people were held hostage for 10 hours at The Robesoniannewspaper in Lumberton, in southeastern North Carolina. No one washurt in the takeover.   Timothy Jacobs, 20, was acquitted of weapons charges. U.S.District Judge Terrence Boyle had dismissed the hostage-takingcount against him earlier this week.   ``The jury has made what is going to be a historic verdict, averdict that people will remember,'' Hatcher said as he left thecourthouse for the first time in two weeks without wearingshackles. ``I don't think people realize yet how important thisverdict is.''   ``I'm just glad that Timothy and Eddie did something to drawattention to the conditions in our county,'' said Eleanor Jacobs,Jacobs' mother. ``I hate they used guns. But they did drawattention to something that was needed. The jury had compassion.They understood things.''   Robesonian Editor Bob Horne, who was one of the hostages, saidhe had no immediate comment on the verdict.   The jury deliberated for less than a day before acquitting thetwo Tuscarora Indians of making and possessing illegal firearms,conspiring to make those weapons and conveying false informationabout explosives. Hatcher also was acquitted of hostage-taking.   In his closing statement Thursday, Hatcher argued that his lifeand that of Jacobs were in jeopardy because of information they hadlinking law enforcement officers to drug trafficking in the county.   ``(Assistant U.S. Attorney John) Bruce talked about theConstitution this morning and how it allows peaceful protest,'' hesaid.   ``When those sworn to uphold the Constitution won't, what do youdo?'' he asked in a closing statement partially written by hisattorney, William Kunstler.   Kunstler could not appear at the trial because he was handling acase in New York.   Bruce argued that even if the defense's allegations ofcorruption among officials in Robeson County were true, theiractions at The Robesonian were not justified.   ``If everything in this whole scenario they have spun out istrue, it still does not justify their putting innocent people interror of their lives,'' Bruce said.   ``What can start out as just a kernel can get some peopleagitated, upset and carried away into doing something criminal,''he said. ``And maybe they just become a little too convinced oftheir own importance. I suggest to you that's what happened here.''   Bruce also argued that allegations of racial injustice wereirrelevant to the case.   Boyle ruled that defense attorneys could not argue that thehostage-taking was justified because Hatcher and Jacobs feared fortheir lives and believed they had no alternative. Instead, defenseattorneys argued that Hatcher and Jacobs did not have criminalintentions in the takeover.   Defense lawyer Lewis Pitts said taking hostages was ``a drasticaction'' he was not trying to minimize but that the intentions ofHatcher and Jacobs were critical to the case.   ``If you put aside the fear and impact on the individuals (atthe newspaper), what it comes down to is if they had a guilty mindor evil intent,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
