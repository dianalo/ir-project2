Rebuffed 18 months ago, interleukin-2 on Friday won therecommendation of an FDA advisory panel after a five-hourhearing. Studies indicate IL-2 offers a chance of completeremission for a few patients, yet it may hasten death forothers -- a risk which confines its use to patients able tobear its harsh and potentially lethal side effects.</LP><TEXT>   Already approved in Europe at prices up to $9,000 pertreatment, IL-2's final market clearance must come from theoffice of FDA Commissioner David Kessler. The commissionerisn't bound by panel recommendations, but they are typicallygiven great weight.   Chiron shares, already buoyed by a market evidentlyexpecting success, rose to $72 before settling down to closeat $69, up 25 cents a share. Chiron acquired the IL-2 productlast month when it bought the drug's developer, Cetus Corp.,for stock valued at $650 million. Both biotechnologycompanies are based in Emeryville, Calif.   &quot;We're obviously pleased,&quot; said Chiron President EdwardPenhoet. &quot;We expected this result, but you can never besure.&quot; Chiron's marketing plans for IL-2 include intensivetraining on how to mute the drug's side effects, and boost apatient's chances of benefit.   Current European sales of IL-2 run $15 million a year, andhe forecast that its initial U.S. market could double that.IL-2 is a genetically engineered copy of a natural humanprotein which boosts the numbers and the tumor-fighting powerof white blood cells.   IL-2, not yet priced in the U.S., sells in Europe for$7,000 to $9,000 per course of treatment. Because patientsmust take IL-2 under the close monitoring of an intensivecare unit, the cost of hospitalization will boost total costto $30,000 to $45,000 per treatment. Patients who respondwell to IL-2 often take a second or even a third course ofthe drug -- doubling or tripling the ultimate bill.   For some 20,000 patients newly diagnosed with kidneycancer each year in the U.S., IL-2 represents a weapon thatis distinctly double-edged: high risk but also potentiallyhigh reward. About 60% of kidney cancer metastasizes orspreads beyond its original site, leaving patients with nocure and a dismal prognosis of six to 12 months. Studiespresented at Friday's hearing indicate those odds arestarting to improve.   Of 255 patients studied, Chiron researchers said at thehearing that IL-2 made tumors shrink or disappear in 37patients, or 15%. That included nine patients, or 4%, whowent into complete remission. The good responses have lastednearly two years on average, and eight of the nine patientsin complete remission remain cancer-free. But 11 patientsdied from side effects of treatment, mostly lethal heart andlung problems provoked by the stress of massive fluidretention in the body.   &quot;Approval of IL-2 represents an important step in thedevelopment of immunotherapy,&quot; said Eugene Schonfeld,president of the National Kidney Cancer Association. Mr.Schonfeld had lectured the FDA panel on its &quot;moralobligation&quot; to approve IL-2. He held the panel partlyaccountable for some 15,750 kidney cancer deaths thatoccurred since it declined to sanction sale of the drug backin June 1990.   But the cool scholarly presentation by Chiron was muchmore persuasive than Cetus's heated and impetuous bid forapproval 18 months ago. FDA panel chairman Jerome Groopman ofHarvard University this time called the clinical responses&quot;impressive and {not} anecdotal.&quot; Even though the drug hasyet to lengthen lifespans for most patients, it offers vividhope for a few. Pioneering IL-2 researcher Steven Rosenbergof the National Cancer Institute documented some graphicrecoveries with slides of bulky tumors melting away to ashadow or less.   It wasn't enough for the lone dissenter in Friday's 7-1vote. &quot;I remain unconvinced,&quot; said Ernest Borden of theMedical College of Wisconsin. He noted the drug's difficultrisk-benefit ratio: &quot;twice as many patients suffered severeneurological toxicity . . . as those who respondedfavorably.&quot;   &quot;IL-2 isn't a cure,&quot; said National Cancer InstituteDirector Samuel Broder in an interview. Still, he noted,winning rare and difficult remissions among patients oncedeemed incurable, is an important step. The FDA panel's votevalidates a decade of federally sponsored research, he added.   Dr. Penhoet confirmed Chiron's intent to build on IL-2'sinitial niche, expanding it into new uses for other cancersand infectious diseases, such as acquired immune deficiencysyndrome. IL-2 is currently being tested in melanoma andAIDS, and in combination with a variety of tumor-fightingcells, though the executive didn't forecast how soon Chironmight seek the FDA's nod.</TEXT></DOC>
