STrickland, director of industrial productivity and quality in theoffice of the assistant Defense secretary for production and logistics, wasmore cautious.andM;&quot;It is just not plausible to impose it as mandatory in any single contract,except perhaps where the contract is so large in dollar value that itsexecution essentially constitutes a companywide effort,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;TQM cannot become a DOD-directed how-to-exercise laid out in a militarystandard,&quot; he said.andM;But, Strickland said, DOD officials wplan to make adherence to TQM principlesa key factor in the source selection process.andM;Dennis Perry, director of Quality at Unisys Defense Systems, said although hehas not seen many TQM requirements in RFPs, he thinks the effort will have amajor impact in the defense industry.andM;&quot;industry recognizes that the concepts embodied by TQM are strategic to theirsurvival in the face of foreign competition.andP;  Made in the USA' is now almosta term of derision,&quot; he said.andM;TQM can save both the government and industry money, Perry said.andP;  With TQM,companies can provide a higher quality product to the government for lesscost, he said.andM;Worried About RequirementsandM;But some companies and industry groups are up in arms about the prospect ofbeing forced to adhere to strict requirements to win government contracts.andM;Electronic Industries Association senior vice president Jean Caffiaux saidalthough his association endorses TQM, many of its members have raised strongconcerns over making the requirements mandatory.andM;&quot;If you make it a contractual requirement, you'll kill it,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Thereis no way you can require companies to have a certain tQM system.andP;  Companiesare too different.&quot;andM;E.C.andP;  Caldwell, vice president of Xerox Corp.'s Custom Systems Division inMcLean, Va., said it is fair for the DOD to require TQM from its contractorsbecause it will save the government money eventually.andM;DOD might judge a company's quality efforts numerically, he said.andP;  &quot;There areminimal requirements everyone must ascribe to have even a minimal qualitymanagement process.andP;  They could judge on that.&quot;andM;Caldwell said measurements could include whether the company has adequatequality training, quality teams and a system of inspection.andM;&quot;ultimately, TQM will show up in reduced cost to the enterprise and to thegovernment, but you have to invest in the front end to get it started,&quot; hesaid.andP;  &quot;If it is working for you, you should be the lower cost, higherquality producer,&quot; making you a natural and easy choice for the government.andM;Even though no one knows exactly how new requirements might affect companies,industry is anticipating changes, said Tim Braithwaite, a group manager atChartway Technologies in Rockville, Md.andP;  He said some of his company'sclients are revamping software development processes to include TQMprinciples.andM;Philip Kiviat, a Chartway vice president, said as industry develops qualitymeasures everyone can agree on, it will be possible for the government toconsider criteria such as the quality performance of the competitors on theirthree preceding jobs.andM;&quot;It will change drastically the way companies behave, the way contracts areawarded,&quot; he said.andM;But Kiviat, along with other industry leaders, said it is too easly todetermine exactly how a company's business would be affected by TQM.andM;Requiring vendor compliance is premature, Kiviat said, because DOD still isdefining TQM and what it will require of its own people.andM;&quot;I have a feeling that nobody at DOD at the Office of Secretary of Defenselevel really knows what to ask contractors to do specifically to furtherTQM,&quot; he said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
