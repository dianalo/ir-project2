Mrs. Say, returning from a trip to France and Switzerland, saidshe was given greater access to French officials than she has hadwith U.S. officials since the beginning of the Iran-Contra scandal.Her brother, Associated Press Middle East correspondent TerryAnderson, 40, was seized in west Beirut March 16, 1985.   Mrs. Say, of Batavia, N.Y., met with Interior Minister CharlesPasqua, who negotiated the French hostages' release.   She also gave a representative of President Francois Mitterranda letter from a group of journalists working for Anderson'srelease, urging the French to use their contacts to seek freedomfor 18 other foreign hostages, including nine Americans still heldby pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon.   ``They told Terry he was going home,'' she said, describingdiplomat Marcel Fontaine's last moments with her brother after theyhad shared a room for several months. Anderson packed and was ledaway, she said, but it was Fontaine, 45, who was released, alongwith diplomat Marcel Carton, 64, and journalist Jean-PaulKauffmann, 44.   The Frenchmen gave her other details about the U.S. hostages,Mrs. Say said, but she said they did not want them made publicunless hostage relatives agree. ``There's always a danger. Thefamilies have to decide if talking about it is worth the risk,''she said.   Meeting with the Frenchmen, however, gave her the feeling that``he's okay, he's going to survive,'' she said.   Mrs. Say said the French hostages were released because Francewas willing to deal with Iran and because the French government,journalists and people ``apparently place a higher value on humanlife'' than the Americans. The French deny that any ransom was paid.   ``The French hostages had a feeling that the Americans had beenabandoned,'' said Mrs. Say.   ``The French people wanted the hostages released. They gavetheir government room to maneuver,'' she said, adding that thescandal over U.S. arms shipments to Iran in exchange for hostageshas doused U.S. popular concern for their release.   Mrs. Say said State Department claims that her government putsthe highest priority on human life are inconsistent with thegovernment's refusal to negotiate or give any concessions for therelease of hostages.</TEXT></DOC>
