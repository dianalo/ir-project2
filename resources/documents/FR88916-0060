Bradley, Deputy AssistantGeneral Counsel for International Affairs, Room 6A-167, Forrestal Building,1000 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20585, (202) 586-2900.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Background: The International Energy Program</ITAG>The agreement on an International Energy Program (IEP), TIAS 8272, November18, 1974, is a U.S. Executive Agreement entered into in the aftermath ofthe 1973-74 Arab oil embargo targeted at the U.S. and the Netherlands.The IEP provide for creation of the International Energy Agency (IEA) asan autonomous agency of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development(OECD). The IEP's main purposes include reducing the Free World oil consumingnations' vulnerability to supply disruptions by encouraging self-sufficiencyin oil supplies; avoiding competition for short supplies of available oilduring a disruption through a program for equitably allocating those suppliesamong the signatory countries; establishing a comprehensive internationalinformation system; and creating a forum for cooperation with governmentsand consultation with oil companies. There now are 21 member countries,consisting of all OECD members except France, Finland and Iceland.The IEP provides that the IEA's Emergency Sharing System can be activatedonly when the IEA group of twenty-one member countries as a whole or anyindividual member country sustains or reasonably can be expected to sustaina seven percent or greater shortfall of available petroleum supplies measuredagainst a specified base period. In the ``general'' trigger situation (asdistinguished from a ``selective'' trigger applicable to one or more butless than all member countries), the IEA sharing formula would distributethe group supply shortfall among IEA member counties on the basis of acombination of (1) a specified common reduction in consumption within eachmember country, and (2) the relative national import-dependency of themember countries (with the more import-dependent countries absorbing thegreatest losses in supplies). The emergency sharing formula establishesnational ``supply rights'' and attributes ``allocation obligations'' and``allocation rights'' to the individual IEA countries depending on whethertheir available oil supplies exceed or fall short of their supply rights.A country having an allocation obligation would be required to supply,to other IEA countries having allocation rights, a portion of the oil availableto it, equal to the excess over its supply right.The oil industry has an important advisory and functional role in the IEA,particularly during real emergencies. A number of U.S. and foreign oilcompanies have agreed to serve as IEA ``Reporting Companies.'' When thereappears to be a serious possibility that an oil supply shortfall will develop,the IEA may request activation of its emergency data system, which callsfor the Reporting Companies to submit directly to the IEA comprehensivedata on their oil imports and exports, their indigenous production andtheir inventories. If this shortfall in fact should develop and the IEA'sEmergency Sharing System were activated during an oil supply crisis, internationaloil allocation is expected to be accomplished through the voluntary supplymeasures of the Reporting Companies, coordinated by the companies' technicalexperts serving on the Industry Supply Advisory Group (ISAG) in Paris.<ITAG tagnum="85">Antitrust Approval for U.S. Industry Participation in the IEA's SixthAllocation System Test</ITAG>In order for U.S. Reporting Companies and their employees to participatein IEA activities, section 252 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act(EPCA), 42 U.S.C. 6272, makes available to U.S. oil companies a limitedantitrust defense and a breach of contract defense for actions taken tocarry out a ``voluntary agreement'' or ``plan of action'' to implementthe allocation and information provisions of the IEP. A ``Voluntary Agreementand Plan of Action to Implement the International Energy Program'' (hereafter``Voluntary Agreement'') was agreed to in 1976 by a number of U.S. Oilcompanies, and approved by the U.S. Government. <T3>See </T3>2 CCH Federal Energy Guidelines, paragraph 15,845. SeventeenU.S. oil companies currently participate in the Voluntary Agreement.\1\<NOTE/> The Secretary of Energy administers the Voluntary Agreementand is responsible, with the concurrence of the Attorney General, for antitrustapprovals with respect thereto.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The U.S. oil companies which participate in the VoluntaryAgreement are: Amerada Hess Corporation, Amoco Corporation, Ashland Oil,Inc., ARCO Oil and Gas Company, BP America, Inc., Caltex Petroleum Corporation,Chevron Corporation, Conoco, Inc., Exxon Company International, Mobil OilCorporation, Occidental Petroleum Corporation, Phillips Petroleum Company,Shell Oil Company, Sun Company, Inc., Texaco, Inc., Union Oil Company ofCalifornia, and Union Pacific Resources Company.The Secretary of Energy and the Attorney General recently approved the``Second Plan of Action to Implement the International Energy Program,''which is an appendix to the Voluntary Agreement. The Second Plan of Actionwill convey antitrust protection to U.S. Oil companies assisting in implementingthe IEA's Emergency Sharing System during an actual international energysupply emergency.Over the years since the IEA was formed, the Secretary of Energy and theAttorney General also have given approval for U.S. oil companies whichparticipate in the Voluntary Agreement to engage in varous IEA allocationsystems tests and related activities. This has been done through the issuanceof antitrust ``approval'' (or ``clearance'') letters. <T3>See, e.g.,</T3> the antitrust approval letter for the IEA's Fifth AllocationSystems Test (AST-5) at 50 FR 41383 (October 10, 1985).U.S. Voluntary Agreement participants now have been requested to assistthe IEA in conducting the IEA's Sixth Allocation Systems Test (AST-6),which will begin with the transmission of a telex by the IEA Secretariaton September 23, 1988, announcing the hypothetical oil supply disruption.Prior to the beginning of AST-6, Reporting Companies will participate intransmission tests involving the IEA's emergency data system and voluntaryoffer process. The primary objective of AST-6 is to continue the programof periodic training of personnel of participating IEA governments, oilcompanies, and the IEA Secretariat, in the data systems and emergency oilallocation procedures developed to implement the provisions of the IEP.AST-6 will include certain new aspects of the Energency Sharing Systemthat have not been tested previously: it will consider a significant innovationin the sharing system, known as the ``Wider Window'' concept, which extendsthe period for processing certain types of voluntary oil supply and receiveoffers over the entire allocation cycle and expedites the processing ofsuch voluntary offers; in addition, AST-6 will test a recent modificationto the timetable for compilation and submission of industry and IEA membercountry data and for the calculation of allocation rights and allocationobligations, which will permit more time for the oil allocation processto function. It should be noted, however, that although the allocationsystems test also will include for the first time a procedure to considerpricing for certain voluntary offer transactions, the Secretary's antiturestapproval letter exludes permission for the U.S. oil companies which participatein the Voluntary Agreement to engage in this particular new aspect of AST-6.As in previous IEA allocation systems tests, IEA Reporting Companies willparticipate in AST-6 in serveral ways. First, Reporting Company employeeswill staff the ISAG in Paris. Second, Reporting Companies will providethe IEA and the ISAG with historical data on their imports, exports, indigenousproduction, and inventories for the period covered by the test. Finally,Reporting Companies will simulate the carrying out of certain hypotheticalsupply reallocation measures; in this connection, Reporting Companies maydiscuss with the IEA, the ISAG and other Reporting Companies, for the purposeof developing and implementing suitable hypothetical reallocation measures,information or data which may be confidential or proprietary.Section 5(b)(1) of the Voluntary Agreement conveys antitrust protectionto the participating oil companies when, prior to an actual emergency,they take part in IEA allocation systems tests this allows them to simulatein a systems test the same kinds of supply activities which would takeplace in a real emergency. The need for an antitrust approval letter inconnecton with such a test arises because of the possibility that companyconfidential or proprietary information or data may be disclosed in thecourse of the test. On this subject, section 5(b)(2) of the Voluntary Agreementprovides that disaggregated, confidential or proprietary information ordata may be disclosed by the companies in a test only to the extent approvedby the Secretary of Energy, after consultation with the Secretary of State,with the concurrence of the Attorney General after he has consulted withthe Federal Trade Commission. The purposes of a test approval letter areto set out the scope of the permission granted for the disclosure of confidentialor proprietary information or data, establish recordkeeping and reportingrequirements, and describe how the U.S. Government will monitor the tests.As required by section 5(b) of the Voluntary Agreement, written approvalhas been given by the Secretary of Energy for the seventeen U.S. oil companieswhich participate in the Voluntary Agreement to disclose confidential orproprietary information or data which is necessary to the conduct of AST-6and the related data transmission tests. This approval letter, which wasdeveloped in cooperatin with the staffs of the Antitrust Division, Departmentof Justice, and of the FTC, incorporates improvements in previous suchletters, based on experience gained in AST-5 and on the recently approvedSecond Plan of Action.Most of the data base for the test_consisting principally of historicalimport, export, indigenous production and stock level data for August 1987through January 1988_acutally will be altered to reflect the effects ofthe AST-6 hypothetical emergency oil disruption scenario. Also, companiesare free to ``mask'' their data if they so wish. The age of the data andtheir potential masking by the companies, combined with the protectionsbuilt into the approval letter, should significantly reduce any risk ofanticompetitive behavior as a result of the disclosure of proprietary companyinformation during AST-6. In addition, as noted above, the Secretary'santitrust approval letter expressly excludes permission for the U.S. oilcompanies to disclose petroleum prices or commercial terms.The documents published in the appendix to this notice are the text ofthe letter of appoval sent to the seventeen U.S. oil companies participatingin the Voluntary Agreement and correspondence among the Department of Energy,the Department of Justice, the Department of State and the Federal TradeCommission evidencing consultation among those agencies and the requiredconcurence of the Department of Justice in the issuance of the letter ofapproval by the Secretary of Energy. The text of the Second Plan of Action,certain provisions of which are adopted for AST-6 purposes by the approvalletter, is not published in the appendix to this notice because of itslength, but may be found at 53 FR 2866 (February 2, 1988).<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC on September 12, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Eric Fygi,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Acting General Counsel.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">List of Appended Documents</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A.

We hope that your company will participatein the tests, and encourage you to cooperate fully with the IEA in theseundertakings.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The following paragraphs of this approval letter have been numberedfor convenience of reference.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. This approval letter applies to the IEA's Sixth Allocation SystemsTest, known as ``AST-6,'' to be conducted during the period September-November1988, and to the IEA's data and voluntary offer transmission tests scheduledfor September 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. This letter sets out guidelines for participation in AST-6 andthe preparatory data and voluntary offer transmission tests by VoluntaryAgreement participants and their employees and provides approval for theprovision, exchange and disclosure of confidential or proprietary informationor data in connection with the tests, as required by the Voluntary agreementand Plan of Action to Implement the International Energy Program (VoluntaryAgreement), 2 CCH Federal Energy Guidelines, Paragraph 15,845. Participationby Voluntary Agreement participants and their employees is governed bysection 252 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), DOE regulationsat 10 C.F.R. Part 209, Department of Justice regulations at 28 C.F.R. Part56, and the Voluntary Agreement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. In September 1988, prior to the beginning of AST-6, the IEA Secretariatwill conduct transmission tests involving the IEA emergency data systemand voluntary offer process. The Secretariat first will request each IEAReporting Company to transmit to it certain IEA Questionnaire A informationor data for the months of August 1987 through January 1988, which ReportingCompanies previously transmitted to the IEA in April 1988. Following thisdata transmission test, the Secretariat will request each Reporting Companyto transmit to it one or more voluntary offers using fictitious data. Approvalunder Section 5(b) of the Voluntary Agreement is hereby given to VoluntaryAgreement participants and their employees to participate in each of thesetests. No later than September 30, 1988, each Voluntary Agreement participantshall submit to the Departments of Energy and Justice, at the addressesprovided in paragraph 11(c) of this letter, one copy of the QuestionnaireA data and one copy of each voluntary offer telex submitted to the IEAin these transmission tests. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. The IEA Secretariat's ``AST-6 Test Guide'' establishes the scopeand objectives of AST-6 and provides instructions for all test participants.The primary objective of AST-6 is to continue the program of periodic trainingof personnel of participating IEA governments, oil companies, and the IEASecretariat, in the data systems and emergency oil allocation proceduresdeveloped to implement the provisions of the Agreement on an InternationalEnergy Program (IEP) (TIAS 8278, November 18, 1974), which are delineatedin the IEA's Emergency Management Manual (EMM) and in the Industry SupplyAdvisory Group/Secretariat Operations Manual (ISOM). AST-6 will includecertain new aspects of the Emergency Oil Sharing System that have not beentested previously: it will consider a significant innovation in the sharingsystem, known as the ``Wider Window'' concept, which extends the voluntaryoffer process for ``closed-loop'' voluntary offers over the entire allocationcycle and expedites the processing of such voluntary offers; in addition,AST-6 will test a recent modification to the timetable for compilationand submission of Questionnaire A/Questionnaire B data and for the calculationof allocation rights and allocation obligations, which will permit moretime for the oil allocation process to function. AST-6 also will includea procedure to consider pricing for ``open-loop'' voluntary offers; however,as indicated in paragraph 7(c) below, this letter does not approve participationin that procedure by Voluntary Agreement participants or their employees.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. AST-6 will begin with the transmittal of a disruption telex bythe IEA Secretariat (expected to occur Friday, September 23, 1988), andwill continue for approximately seven weeks. It will consist of one fulland one curtailed monthly allocation cycle. Prior to the completion ofthe full one month cycle commencing October 1, 1988, a second disruptiontelex will be released by the Secretariat. The test will terminate approximatelyNovember 15, 1988. For notice purposes under the Voluntary Agreement, thetest activities of the Industry Supply Advisory Group (ISAG) at the testsite in Paris will be conducted as a single meeting of the ISAG carriedout in accordance with Section 5 of the Voluntary Agreement. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">6. Attached hereto is a copy of the Second Plan of Action to Implementthe International Energy Program (Second Plan of Action), which is AppendixB to the Voluntary Agreement. The Second Plan of Action has been approvedby the Secretary of Energy and the Attorney General for potential use duringan actual international energy supply emergency. The Second Plan of Actionhas been attached hereto for convenience of reference, because the followingparagraphs of this approval letter adopt certain of its provisions forpurposes of AST-6. For purposes of this letter, all references in the SecondPlan of Action to the allocation site or to allocation activities shallbe deemed to refer to the AST-6 test site and AST-6 test activities. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">7. Approval under Section 5(b) of the Voluntary Agreement is herebygiven to Voluntary Agreement participants and their employees engaged inAST-6 to participate in the types of communications specified in Sections5.1 and 5.3 of the Second Plan of Action, and, in those communications,to provide, exchange and disclose the types of information or data listedin Sections 6.1-6.14 of the Second Plan of Action which may be, or whichmay reveal, confidential or proprietary information or data.

However,it is understood that the IEA Secretariat will not permit any disaggregatedQuestionnaire A data of a Reporting Company, other than Questionnaire Adata submitted by the Reporting Company during AST-6, to be made availableto any other Reporting Company or ISAG representative thereof. In addition,the U.S. Government representatives at the test site shall have the rightto restrict the access of U.S. ISAG personnel to any Questionnaire A datasubmitted by a Reporting Company during AST-6 that is or may be unaffectedby the assumed supply disruption. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">8. Prior to the time the ISAG convenes at the test site in Paris (andpossibly after the ISAG's departure from the test site) the IEA Secretariatmay initiate telephone conference calls with certain members of the ISAG(including the ISAG Manager and Deputy Manager, the head of ISAG's SupplyCoordination subgroup, and other ISAG members as appropriate) to obtaintheir advice, for example, on ``closed-loop'' voluntary offers which havebeen submitted to the Allocation Coordinator for his approval. In advanceof such telephone conference calls, the IEA Secretariat may transmit topotential participants in the telephone conferences, information describingpending closed-loop voluntary offers, but excluding the names of the offeringand receiving companies. Voluntary Agreement participant employees servingon the ISAG may participate in such telephone conferences, provided thata representative of the Department of Energy, the Department of Justice,or the Federal Trade Commission participates in any such telephone conferencecall involving Voluntary Agreement participant employees serving on theISAG who are not present at the test site. The U.S. Government observershall be responsible for ensuring that a verbatim transcript is made orfor keeping a written record of each such telephone conference. Consistentwith Section 8.3(B) of the Second Plan of Action, failure of the U.S. Governmentto maintain a full and complete written record shall not vitiate the antitrustdefense accorded by section 252 of the EPCA for a Voluntary Agreement participantor its employees, unless such failure is due to the willful act of theVoluntary Agreement participant's employee serving on the ISAG or of theVoluntary Agreement participant. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">9.

The test, known as AST-6, willcommence with the IEA's distribution on September 23 of a telex announcingthe hypothetical oil supply disruption which will provide the backdropfor the test. Prior to the beginning of AST-6, the IEA will conduct preparatorytransmission tests involving the IEA emergency data system and voluntaryoffer process.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The conduct of AST-6 and the related transmission tests will requirethe active participation of U.S. oil companies. Pursuant to section 252of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, 42 U.S.C. 6272, the Departmentof Energy's regulations at 10 C.F.R. Part 209, the Department of Justice'sregulations at 28 C.F.R. Part 56, and the ``Voluntary Agreement and Planof Action to Implement the International Energy Program,'' 2 CCH FederalEnergy Guidelines para. 15, 845, an antitrust defense is made availableto U.S. oil companies to facilitate their involvement in IEA activities.In order for the U.S. oil companies which are signatories to the VoluntaryAgreement to receive the benefit of this antitrust defense for any disclosureor exchange of confidential or proprietary information or data which maybe necessary in these tests, section 5(b)(2) of the Voluntary Agreementrequires that the Secretary of Energy approve such exchange or disclosure,after consultation with the Secretary of State, and with the concurrenceof the Attorney General, after the Attorney General has consulted withthe Federal Trade Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Enclosed is an approval letter which I propose to send to the U.S.oil companies which are signatories to the Voluntary Agreement. This letterwas developed by the Department of Energy in conjunction with staffs ofthe Antitrust Division, Department of Justice, the Department of Stateand the Federal Trade Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In our view the participation of U.S. oil companies and U.S. oil companypersonnel is essential to the conduct of these tests. Such participationmay necessitate the disclosure and exchange of confidential or proprietaryinformation or data as specifically set forth in the proposed approvalletter. Therefore, I am writing to request your views with respect to myintended approval. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">   Yours truly,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">John S.

Herrington, Secretary of Energyand Administrator of the Voluntary Agreement and Plan of Action to Implementthe International Energy Program (``Voluntary Agreement''), has requestedyour concurrence to a proposed letter. The letter provides clearance tothe oil-company signatories of the Voluntary Agreement to exchange confidentialand proprietary information among themselves and to provide such informationand data to the International Energy Agency (``IEA'') during the IEA'ssixth test of the emergency oil allocation system. (``AST-6''), being October1, 1988. In addition the letter authorizes the oil companies to providecertain oil supply data originally provided to the IEA in April 1988. Underthe Voluntary Agreement, the Attorney General must consult with the Commissionbefore concurring in the provision or exchange of this information.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Section 252 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, 42 U.S.C. andSection;6272,directs the Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission to monitorthe carrying out of the Voluntary Agreement. The Commission has examinedthe types of data and information proposed to be exchanged during AST-6.The data to be used during AST-6 will be roughly one year old, likely tobe distorted due to the hypothetical supply disruption, and subject tomasking by the submitting company. Additionally, U.S. Government monitorswill be at the IEA site during the test and will have access to the officesof U.S. companies participating in AST-6 to interview company employeesengaged in test-related activities. The U.S. government will make or obtaina full and complete record of all communications among U.S. oil companypersonnel, including a verbatim transcript of most group meetings. Finally,the proposed clearance letter prohibits removal of documents from the testsite without written U.S. Government approval and also prohibits communicationof confidential information learned at the test to persons not involvedin the test.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In light of both the limited competitive significance of the dataand the procedural safeguards that are proposed, the Commission does notobject to your approval of the exchange of information and data neededto carry out AST-6.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">By direction of the Commission.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Donald S.
