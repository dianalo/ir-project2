Minority carrier life-time of gettered Siwafers was increased and measurements of C-V characteristics of getteredSi wafers also indicate that the gettering process produces an improvedSiO{sub 2}/Si interface. Intrinsic gettering was also compared with As-implantedand P-diffused back side gettering and found to be superior in this study.</TEXT></DOC>
