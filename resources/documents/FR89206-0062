The Decision sets forth the final procedures that the DOE has formulatedto distribute crude oil overcharge funds obtained from the Lone Star Oiland Chemical Company and the Holly Corporation. The funds are being heldin interest-bearing escrow accounts pending distribution by the DOE.The OHA has decided to distribute these funds in accordance with the DOE'sModified Statement of Restitutionary Policy Concerning Crude Oil Overcharges,51 FR 27899 (August 4, 1986). Under the Modified Policy, crude oil overchargemonies are divided among the states, the federal government, and injuredpurchasers of refined products. Refunds to the states will be distributedin proportion to each state's consumption of petroleum products duringthe period of price controls. Refunds to eligible purchasers will be basedon the number of gallons of petroleum products which they purchased andthe extent to which they can demonstrate injury.Applications for refund must be filed by October 31, 1989, and should besent to the address set forth at the beginning of this notice. The informationwhich claimants should include in their applications is explained in theDecision, which immediately follows, and in <T3>Ernest A.

These procedures are used to refund moniesto those injured by actual or alleged violations of the DOE price regulations.On March 10 and July 21, 1988, the ERA filed Petitions for the Implementationof Special Refund Procedures (the Petitions) with the Office of Hearingsand Appeals (OHA). The March 10, 1988 Petition concerns the ERA's settlementof enforcement proceedings with the Lone Star Oil and Chemical Company(Lone Star) and the July 21, 1988 Petition concerns the ERA's settlementof enforcement proceedings with the Holly Corporation (Holly). In thesePetitions, the ERA requests that the OHA formulate and implement proceduresfor distributing funds obtained through these settlements. <T3>See</T3> 10 CFR Part 205, Subpart V.Lone Star and Holly have remitted a total of $1,950,756.18 to the DOE pursuantto their settlement agreements. An additional $101,104.46 in interest hasaccrued on that amount as of December 31, 1988. This Decision and Orderestablishes procedures for distributing the sum of this principal and interest,or $2,051,860.64, and additional interest accruing in the Holly and LoneStar subaccounts after December 31, 1988.During the period June 1978 through January 1980, Lone Star was a ``reseller''of crude oil as that term is defined in 10 CFR 212.31. Lone Star was thereforesubject to the provisions of the Mandatory Petroleum Price Regulations.10 CFR Part 212. The ERA conducted an extensive audit of Lone Star's operationsand found in a Proposed Remedial Order (PRO) that the firm had violatedapplicable DOE pricing regulations in its sales of crude oil. The PRO wasissued as a final Remedial Order (RO) by the OHA on August 26, 1986. <T3>Lone Star Oil and Chemical Company/Michael A. McAlister</T3>, 14 DOEandpara; 83,044 (1986). Lone Star filed an appeal of the RO on October 10,1986. <T3>Appeal docketed </T3>No. 86-35-000 (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,October 10, 1986). In order to settle the claims and disputes between LoneStar and the DOE that were raised in the RO, the two parties entered intoa Consent Order on April 18, 1987 (the Lone Star Consent Order). In accordancewith the terms of that Consent Order, Lone Star paid $184,267.15 to theDOE on February 8, 1988.Holly was a ``producer'' of crude oil as that term is defined in 10 CFR212.31 and was also subject to Part 212 of the Mandatory Petroleum PriceRegulations. During the period June 1979 through December 1980, Holly producedand sold crude oil from three properties located in Goliad and Whartoncounties, Texas. The ERA conducted an extensive audit of Holly's operationsand found in a PRO that the firm had violated applicable DOE pricing regulationsin its sales of crude oil. This PRO was issued as a final RO by the OHAon March 29, 1985. <T3>Holly Energy, Inc. and Holly Corporation, </T3>12 DOE andpara; 83,036(1985). The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission affirmed the RemedialOrder on November 26, 1985. <T3>Holly Corporation and Holly Energy, Inc., </T3>37 FERC andpara; 61,187(1986).\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Holly's action seeking judicial review of the RemedialOrder was terminated when a Stipulation of Withdrawal was entered by theU.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on June 7, 1988.In order to settle all claims and disputes between Holly and the DOE, thetwo parties entered into a Settlement Agreement on July 31, 1987. The Departmentof Justice agreed to the Settlement Agreement, modified by an Amendment.In accordance with the terms of the Amendment to the Settlement Agreement,Holly paid $1,766,489.03 to the DOE on April 29, 1988.Neither the Lone Star Consent Order nor the Holly amended Settlement Agreementmakes any provision for the distribution of the funds remitted by the thosefirms. In its Petitions, the ERA states that it has been unable to identifypersons injured by the alleged overcharges or the amount which any individualmay be entitled to receive. The ERA therefore requests that OHA establishappropriate procedures for the distribution of the funds remitted by LoneStar and Holly in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR Subpart V.The Subpart V process is specifically designed to be used in situationswhere the DOE cannot readily identify the persons who may have been injuredas a result of actual or alleged violations of the regulations or ascertainthe amount of the refund each person should receive. For a more detaileddiscussion of Subpart V and the authority of the OHA to fashion proceduresto distribute refunds, see <T3>Office of Enforcement</T3>, 9 DOE andpara; 82,508 (1981), and <T3>Office of Enforcement, 8 DOE andpara; 82,597 (1981). We have consideredthe ERA's request to implement Subpart V procedures with respect to themonies received from Lone Star and Holly, and have determined that suchprocedures are appropriate.</T3>I. BackgroundOn July 28, 1986, as a result of the court-approved Settlement Agreementin <T3>In Re: The Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation,</T3>M.D.L. No. 378, the DOE issued a Modified Statement of RestitutionaryPolicy (MSRP) providing that crude oil overcharge revenues will be dividedamong the States, the United States Treasury, and eligible purchasers ofcrude oil and refined products. 51 FR 27899 (August 4, 1986). Eighty percentof the funds, and any monies remaining after all valid claims are paid,are to be disbursed equally to the states and federal government for indirectrestitution. The OHA has been applying the MSRP to all Subpart V proceedingsinvolving alleged crude oil violations. <T3>See</T3> Order Implementing the MSRP, 51 FR 29689 (August 20, 1986).That Order provided a period of 30 days for the filing of any objectionsto the application of the MSRP, and solicited comments concerning the appropriateprocedures to follow in processing refund applications in crude oil refundproceedings.On April 10, 1987, the OHA issued a Notice analyzing the numerous commentswhich it received in response to the August 1986 Order. 52 FR 11737. TheNotice set forth generalized procedures and provided guidance to assistclaimants that wish to file refund applications for crude oil monies underthe Subpart V regulations. All applicants for refunds would be requiredto document their purchase volumes of petroleum products during the periodof price controls and to prove that they were injured by the alleged overcharges.The Notice indicated that end-users of petroleum products whose businessesare unrelated to the petroleum industry will be presumed to have absorbedthe crude oil overcharges, and need not submit any further proof of injuryto receive a refund. Finally, we stated that refunds would be calculatedon the basis of a volumetric refund amount derived by dividing crude oilviolation amounts of the total consumption of petroleum products in theUnited States during the period of price controls. The numerator wouldinclude the crude oil overcharge monies that were in the DOE's escrow accountat the time of the settlement and a portion of the funds in the M.D.L.378 escrow at the time of the settlement.The DOE has applied these procedures in numerous cases since the April1987 Notice, <T3>see, e.g. Shell Oil Co., </T3>17 DOE andpara; 85,204 (1988), and <T3>Ernest A. Allerkamp, </T3>17 DOE andpara; 85,079 (1988) (<T3>Allerkamp</T3>), and the procedures have been approved by the UnitedStates District Court for the District of Kansas. Various states had fileda Motion with the Court, claiming that the OHA violated the SettlementAgreement by employing presumptions of injury for end-users and by improperlycalculating the refund amount to be used in those proceedings. On August17, 1987, Judge Theis issued an Opinion and Order denying the States' Motionin its entirety. The court concluded that the Settlement Agreement ``doesnot bar OHA from permitting claimants to employ reasonable presumptionsin affirmatively demonstrating injury entitling them to a refund.'' <T3>In Re: The Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation,</T3>671 F. Supp. 1318, 1323 (D. Kan. 1987). The court also ruled that,as specified in the April 1987 Notice, the OHA could calculate refundsbased on a portion of the M.D.L. 378 overcharges. <T3>Id.</T3> at 1323-24. The states appealed the latter ruling, and theTemporary Emergency Court of Appeals affirmed Judge Theis' decision. <T3>In Re: The Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation</T3>,3 Fed. Energy Guidelines andpara; 26.606 (Temp. Emer. Ct. App. 1988).II. The Proposed Decisions and OrdersOn October 12, 1988, the OHA issued a Proposed Decision and Order (PDandamp;O)establishing tentative procedures to distribute the alleged crude oil violationamounts obtained from Holly. On November 16, 1988, the OHA issued a PDandamp;Oestablishing identical tentative procedures to distribute the monies obtainedfrom Lone Star. The OHA tentatively concluded that these monies shouldbe distributed in accordance with the MSRP and the April 10, 1987 Notice.Pursuant to the MSRP, the OHA proposed to reserve initially 20 percentof the alleged crude oil violations amounts to satisfy claims from injuredparties that purchased refined petroleum products between August 19, 1973and January 31, 1981 (the crude oil price control period). The remaining80 percent of the funds would be distributed to the state and federal governmentsfor indirect restitution. Once all valid claims are paid, by remainingfunds in the claims reserve also would be divided between the state andfederal governments. The federal government's share of the unclaimed fundswill ultimately be deposited into the general fund of the Treasury of theUnited States.In the PDandamp;O's, the OHA proposed to require applicants for refund todocument their purchase volumes of petroleum products during the periodof price controls and to prove that they were injured by the alleged crudeoil overcharges. The PDandamp;O's stated that the petroleum products whosebusinesses are unrelated to the petroleum industry could use a presumptionthat they absorbed the crude oil overcharges, and need not submit any furtherproof of injury to receive a refund. The OHA also proposed to calculaterefunds on the basis of a volumetric refund amount, as described in theApril 10, 1987 Notice. Comments were solicited regarding the tentativedistribution process set forth in the PDandamp;O's.III. Discussion of the Comments Received No comments were received by the OHA concerning the Lone Star PDandamp;O.In response to the Holly PDandamp;O, the OHA received comments from PhilipP. Kalodner as counsel for six electric utilities, 14 foreign-flag shippingcompanies, and four pulp and paper manufacturers. Mr. Kalodner's clientsare all potential recipients of crude oil refunds. These comments consistof a 12 page brief originally filed by Mr. Kalodner in the OHA proceedinginvolving Salomon Inc., <T3>et al.</T3>, Case No. KEF-0109 <T3>et al. </T3>(the Salomon brief), and a five page supplemental brief.In these comments, Mr. Kalodner contends that the OHA should not distribute80 percent of the alleged crude oil violation amounts to the states andfederal government. According to Mr. Kalodner, such a distribution will``preclude full direct restitution to claimants.'' Salomon brief at 4.Mr. Kalodner claims that the 20 percent reserve is insufficient to satisfyall of the legitimate claims that have been or will be filed in these proceedings.Mr. Kalodner asserts that both the DOE and the states assured the UnitedStates District Court for the District of Kansas that the amount reservedfor the claims process would be adequate to provide refunds for all successfulclaimants. ``Having provided that assurance in order to obtain approvalof the Court of the Final Settlement Agreement and the benefits to themselves,the states and the DOE are required by the doctrine of judicial estoppelto make good on that assurance.'' Salomon brief at 5. The arguments presented by Mr. Kalodner in the Salomon brief have beenconsidered and rejected by the OHA in <T3>New York Petroleum</T3>, <T3>Inc.</T3>, <T3>et al.</T3>, 18 DOE andpara; 85,435 at 88,700-01 (1988) (<T3>New York Petroleum</T3>). As we stated in that decision and order,the arguments contained in the Salomon brief concerning the alleged insufficiencyof the 20 percent reserve are completely unsupported by any solid evidence.Moreover, it is the position of OHA that the 20 percent set aside is nota discretionary figure but is the upper limit for that reserve as mandatedby the following terms of the Settlement Agreement: <ITAG tagnum="21">OHA may reserve a reasonable portion of funds from each such proceedingto satisfy potentially provable claims of identifiable injured claimantswho have not waived their claims, but such reserve <T3>shall not exceed 20 percent </T3>of the monies in such proceeding andamounts in excess of the reserve shall be distributed while awaiting completionof the first stage refund proceedings. The percentage of the reserve willbe altered * * * periodically * * * to reflect the amount of reserve thatis warranted and sufficient to provide adequate funding for eligible first-stageclaims, and will be lowered as justified by claims experience as a consequenceof this Agreement. </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Settlement Agreement at IV.B.6, 6 Fed Energy Guidelines andpara; 90,509at 90,665 (emphasis added). Thus the OHA may not set aside more than 20 percent of alleged crude oilviolation amounts for direct refunds to injured claimants. The OHA mayreduce the size of this reserve, but it may not raise the reserve above20 percent of the funds received. <T3>New York Petroleum</T3>, 18 DOE at 88,701; <T3>A. Tarricone, Inc.</T3>, 15 DOE andpara; 85,495 at 88,893 (1987) (<T3>Tarricone</T3>). The remainder of the crude oil violation amounts mustbe distributed to the states and federal government prior to the completionof the refund claims process. An identical reading of this portion of the Settlement Agreement was recentlymade by the United States District Court for the District of Delaware in<T3>Getty Oil Company </T3>v. <T3>The Department of Energy, et al.</T3>, Civil Action No. 77-434 MMS,decided December 28, 1988 (<T3>Getty</T3>). In that decision, the court rejected the contention ofvarious <T3>amici </T3>petitioners that they possessed an absolute right underthe Settlement Agreement to the availability of adequate funds for successfulindividual claimants. In this regard the court noted the following: <ITAG tagnum="21">The [settlement] agreement, however, does not provide for an upwardadjustment based upon the amount of claims. Rather it provides for onlya maximum reserve of 20 percent for individual claimants and a provisionfor a downward adjustment if the 20 percent is not distributed. <T3>Stripper Well </T3>Agreement, Dkt. 263 at IV.B.6. Thus based on the<T3>Stripper Well </T3>Agreement itself <T3>amici </T3>cannot claim a right to a refund greater than 20 percentof the fund. </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T3>Getty</T3>, slip opinion at 14. Accordingly, we find no merit in Mr.Kalodner's assertions concerning the inadequacy of the 20 percent reservefor individual claimants.\2\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ The comments submitted by Mr. Kalodner also suggest thatthe OHA add various amounts to the numerator of the volumetric formulain order to increase the size of refunds. These suggestions were previouslyconsidered and rejected in <T3>Allerkamp</T3>, 17 DOE at 88,174-75. <T3>See also New York Petroleum</T3>, 18 DOE at 88,701, note 3. Mr. Kalodnerhas presented no new arguments to justify a reconsideration of those issuesin this determination. As we stated in the Holly and Lone Star PDandamp;O's, we have decided toreserve initially the full 20 percent of the alleged crude oil violationamounts subject to those determinations in order to ensure that sufficientfunds will be available for refunds to injured claimants. We will thereforeadopt the procedures as proposed in the PDandamp;O's, and order the disbursementto the states and the federal government of 80 percent of the alleged crudeoil violation amounts received from Lone Star and Holly. IV. The Refund Procedures <ITAG tagnum="81">A. Refund Claims</ITAG>After considering the comments received concerning the Holly PDandamp;O,we have concluded that the $1,950,756.18 in funds involved in the Hollyand Lone Star proceedings, plus the accrued interest on these funds, shouldbe distributed in accordance with the crude oil refund procedures previouslydiscussed. Accordingly, we have decided to reserve the full 20 percent,or $390,151.24, of the alleged violations amounts, plus a proportionateshare of the accrued interest, for direct restitution to claimants thatpurchased refined petroleum products during the crude oil price controlperiod. The amount of the reserve may be adjusted downward later if circumstanceswarrant such action.The process which the OHA will use to evaluate claims based on crude oilviolations will be modeled after the process the OHA has used to evaluateclaims based on alleged refined product overcharges pursuant to 10 CFRPart 205, Subpart V. <T3>Mountain Fuel Supply Co., </T3>14 DOE andpara;85,475 (1986) (<T3>Mountain Fuel</T3>). As in non-crude oil cases, applicants will berequired to document their purchase volumes and to prove that they wereinjured by the alleged violations. (<T3>i.e. </T3>that they did not pass through the alleged overcharges totheir customers). We will apply the standards for showing injury that theOHA has developed in analyzing non-crude oil claims. <T3>See, e.g., Dorchester Gas Corp., </T3>14 DOE andpara;85,240 (1986). Thesestandards include a finding that end-users and ultimate consumers whosebusinesses are unrelated to the petroleum industry were injured by a consentorder firm's alleged overcharges. From our experience with Subpart V refundproceedings, we believe that potential claimants will fall into the followingcategories: (1) End-users, <T3>i.e., </T3>consumers who used refined petroleum products; (2) regulatednon-petroleum industry entities that used refined petroleum products intheir businesses, or cooperatives that purchased refined petroleum productsfor their businesses; and (3) refiners, resellers or retailers who resoldrefined petroleum products.In establishing the procedures which govern this refund proceeding, weadopt certain presumptions that will permit claimants to participate inthe refund process without incurring inordinate expense and will enablethe OHA to consider refund applications in the most efficient manner possible.<T3>American Pacific International, </T3>14 DOE andpara;85,158 (1986). First,we presume that the alleged overcharges were dispersed equally in all salesof refined products made during the period of crude oil price controlsand that refunds should therefore be made on a volumetric per gallon basis.A volumetric refund assumption is sound because of the DOE price regulationsgenerally required a regulated firm to account for increased costs on afirm-wide basis in determining its prices.We also adopt a number of injury presumptions that will simplify and streamlinethe refund process. These presumptions excuse members of certain applicantcategories from proving that they were injured by Holly's alleged overcharges.Applicants who were end-users or ultimate consumers of petroleum products,whose business are unrelated to the petroleum industry, and who were notsubject to the DOE price regulations are presumed to have absorbed ratherthan passed on alleged crude oil overcharges. In order to receive a refund,end-users need not submit any further evidence of injury beyond volumesof product purchased. <T3>See Tarricone, </T3>15 DOE at 88,893-96. The end-user presumption ofinjury is rebuttable, however. <T3>Berry Holding Company, </T3>16 DOE andpara;85,405 at 88,797. If an interestedparty submits evidence which is of sufficient weight to cast serious doubton the end-user presumption, the applicant will be required to producefurther evidence of injury.Firms outside the petroleum industry whose prices for goods and serviceswere regulated by a government agency or by the terms of a cooperativeagreement need not demonstrate injury as a result of alleged overchargeson refined products. We will require such applicants to certify that theywill pass any refund received through to their customers and provide uswith a detailed explanation of how they plan to accomplish this restitution.We will also require them to explain how they will notify the appropriateregulatory body or membership group of their receipt of the refund money.<T3>See Office of Special Counsel, </T3>9 DOE andpara;82,538 at 85,203 (1982).A cooperative's sales of petroleum products to non-members will be treatedin the same manner as sales by other resellers. Cooperatives should thereforeprovide the DOE with a breakdown of their sales volumes to members andnon-members.Reseller and retailer claimants must submit detailed evidence of injury,and may not rely on the presumptions of injury utilized in refund casesinvolving refined petroleum products. They can, however, use econometricevidence of the type employed by the OHA in the <T3>Stripper Well Report. </T3>Applicants who executed and submitted avalid waiver pursuant to one of the escrows established in the SettlementAgreement have waived their rights to apply for crude oil refunds underSubpart V. <T3>Boise Cascade Corp., </T3>16 DOE andpara; 85,214 at 88,411 (1987); <T3>Sea-Land Service, Inc., </T3>16 DOE andpara; 85,496 at 88,991 n. 1 (1987).Refunds to eligible claimants who purchased refined petroleum productswill be calculated on the basis of a volumetric refund amount derived bydividing the combined Lone Star and Holly refund pool of $1,950,756.18by the total consumption of petroleum products in the United States duringthe crude oil price control period (2,020,997,335,000 gallons). <T3>Mountain Fuel, </T3>14 DOE at 88,867. This approach reflects the factthat crude oil overcharges were spread to every region by the EntitlementsProgram.\3\<NOTE/> The volumetric amount for the crude oil pool establishedin the Lone Star and Holly proceedings is therefore $0.00000096525 pergallon of refined products purchased ($1,950,756.18/2,020,997,335,000=$0.00000096525).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ The Department of Energy established the EntitlementsProgram to equalize access to the benefits of crude oil price controlsamong all domestic refiners and their downstream customers. To accomplishthis goal, refiners were required to make transfer payments among themselvesthrough the purchase and sale of ``entitlements.'' This balancing mechanismhad the effect of evenly dispersing overcharges resulting from crude oilmiscertifications thorughout the domestic refining industry. <T3>See, e.g., Amber Refining, Inc., </T3>13 DOE andpara; 85,217 (1985).As we stated in previous Decisions, a crude oil refund applicant will berequired to submit only one application for crude oil overcharge funds.<T3>See Allerkamp, </T3>17 DOE at 88,176. Any party that has previouslysubmitted a refund application in crude oil refund proceedings need notfile another application; that application will be deemed to be filed inall crude oil proceedings finalized to date. The volumetric refund amountwill be increased as additional crude oil violation amounts are receivedin the future. Applicants may be required to submit additional informationto document their refund claims for these future amounts. Notice of anyadditional amounts available in the future will be published in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4>Any party who has not previously submitted a refund application in thecrude oil refund proceeding may submit such an application to the OHA atthis time. The application should specifically identify the volumes ofpetroleum products for which a refund is being claimed and provide informationconcerning the applicant's use of the petroleum products. Several recentOHA decisions have contained detailed discussions of the suggested contentsof a crude oil refund application. <T3>New York Petroleum, </T3>18 DOE at 88,704-05; <T3>Allerkamp, </T3>17 DOE at 88,177; <T3>Tarricone, </T3>15 DOE at 88,898. All applications should be typedor printed and clearly labelled ``Application for Crude Oil Refund.'' Eachapplicant must submit an original and one copy of the application, whichshould be mailed to the following address:<ITAG tagnum="15">Subpart V Crude Oil Overcharge Refunds, Office of Hearings and Appeals,U.S. Department of Energy, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC20585.</ITAG>Although an applicant need not use any special application form to applyfor a crude oil refund, a suggested form has been prepared by the OHA andmay be obtained by sending a written request to the address listed above.B. Payment to the States and the Federal GovernmentUnder the terms of the MSRP, the remaining 80 percent of the Lone Starand Holly payments to the DOE, or $1,560,604.94, plus $80,883.57 in interestthrough December 31, 1988, or $1,641,488.51, will be disbused equally tothe state and federal governments for indirect restitution. We will directthe DOE's Office of the Controller to separate and divide this amount,and to distribute $820,744.26 to the states crude oil tracking accountand $820,744.26 to the federal government crude oil tracking account. Thestates and the federal government will also recive 80 percent of the interestaccruing in the Long Star and Holly subaccounts from January 1, 1989 throughthe date on which the funds are transferred. In the near future, we willissue a Decision and Order directing the DOE's Office of the Controllerto make the appropriate disbursements to the individual states from theirrespective subaccount. This future Order is necessary to improve our abilityto track the various disbursements to the states. Refunds to the stateswill be in proportion to the consumption of petroleum products in eachstate during the period of price controls.
