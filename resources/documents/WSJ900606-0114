One who remembers wellis former federal judge Robert Bork, who last week filed theappeal on Mr. Wallach's behalf.   Mr. Wallach is an unlikely source for Mr. Bork'sattentions. He is a real-life San Francisco Democrat andformer plaintiff's personal injury lawyer. His idiosyncraciesinclude styling his name e. robert wallach. He became famousfor sending unsolicited liberal advice in literally thousandsof memos to his old law-school friend and then-AttorneyGeneral Meese.</LP><TEXT>   That Mr. Bork took on Mr. Wallach's case -- and for whatthe now-broke Mr. Wallach says is on a no-fee basis --illustrates the new definition of a civil libertarian: aconservative who's seen RICO in action. Mr. Bork's 101-pagebrief gives federal appeals judges plenty of reasons to pluckthe Wallach feather off the cap of former prosecutor RudolphGiuliani when they hear the case, probably in the fall.   Mr. Wallach volunteered his legal services to Wedtech in1981 after learning about this minority-owned businessthriving in the difficult worlds of the Bronx and Pentagonprocurement. The defense firm, which became the largestemployer in the borough thanks to federal minority set-asidecontracts, seemed to be a marvel. It turned out to be afraud.   Mr. Wallach didn't know it, but Wedtech executives MarioMarino and Anthony Guariglia bribed politicians, includingReps. Mario Biaggi and Robert Garcia, who were convicted andresigned from Congress. The Wedtech officers also lootedmillions from the firm. But partly in exchange for testifyingagainst Mr. Wallach, Messrs. Marino and Guariglia pleabargained sweetheart sentences. Mr. Marino got 18 months injail, and Mr. Guariglia got five months in a halfway house --even after prosecutors admitted he had committed perjury inMr. Wallach's trial (see related article: Bork: `A Trial ThatCannot Be Countenanced' -- WSJ June 6, 1990).   In contrast, federal District Court Judge Richard Owengave Mr. Wallach six years in jail. What were Mr. Wallach'scrimes? First, what they were not. &quot;Wallach did not causeWedtech to suffer any pecuniary loss,&quot; Mr. Bork wrote.&quot;Indeed, the government conceded that his work, theperformance of which was indisputably legal, was `worthmillions and millions and millions of dollars to Wedtech.'&quot;Even a congressional report on Wedtech cleared Mr. Wallach ofany legal wrongdoing.   But RICO means never having to prove a real crime. In1988, the jury found Mr. Wallach guilty of a new RICO:mailing allegedly misleading legal bills.   Here's what happened. In 1983, Mr. Wallach began to bepaid for his work for Wedtech, which included some 200 legalmemos. Mr. Wallach sent a letter to Wedtech officersacknowledging payment for work on Wedtech's stock offering.The supposed crime was that the letter failed to mention hislobbying of Mr. Meese on behalf of Wedtech. Prosecutorsadmitted that the lobbying -- which Mr. Wallach denies --would have been perfectly legal. It was the allegedincompleteness of the legal bill that made it racketeering.   Under this view of RICO, the defrauded parties wereWedtech shareholders. RICO vagaries aside, basic corporatelaw says that control of expenses such as legal bills is bycorporate directors, not shareholders. Mr. Bork argues thatsince no Wedtech director was defrauded, there was no crime.   The other racketeering act was based on a second letteracknowledging a fee for Mr. Wallach's legal services.Prosecution witnesses Marino and Guariglia said this actuallywas a pre-payment for lobbying Mr. Wallach would do once hehad taken a Justice Department job. But Mr. Wallach deniesany such quid pro quo; there was no evidence he was everoffered any such post; and the conflict-of-interest lawapplies only to people who at some point actually holdfederal office.   Indeed, it's hard to credit the prosecution case as aserious legal argument. The 8,000-page trial transcriptsuggests something else was going on. Mr. Wallach's supposedcrimes had nothing to do with Mr. Meese and they hadeverything to do with Mr. Meese. That is, the indictment didnot allege any criminal behavior between Mr. Wallach and Mr.Meese, yet prosecutors used Mr. Meese to win a conviction.   The true flavor of the case can be gleaned from thefollowing part of the prosecutor's summary to the New YorkCity jury:   &quot;We had a president for eight years named Ronald Reaganand you know Ronald Reagan. He was an actor from Hollywood.He parlayed his Hollywood contacts into political contacts inCalifornia. Eventually he became the governor of that stateand then ultimately he became president of the U.S. and whenhe became president of the U.S. he brought to the White Houseall of his buddies from California. One of those buddies wasa man named Edwin Meese III. Edwin Meese III had a bestfriend and his name was Robert Wallach.&quot;   Prosecutors called Mr. Meese &quot;corrupt&quot; and hisrelationship with Mr. Wallach &quot;improper, unethical andwrong.&quot; These were smears with a purpose. &quot;Wallach was notbeing tried for any allegations of illegal dealings withEdwin Meese,&quot; Mr. Bork wrote, &quot;yet major parts of thegovernment's closing arguments were devoted to claims thatthere was a corrupt relationship.&quot; These included issues asfar afield as a proposed pipeline to the Gulf of Aqaba in theMideast and independent counsel and ethics reports on Mr.Meese. Prosecutors told the jury to convict for someappearance of an impropriety. Or, as Mr. Bork put it moresubtly, &quot;on a charge not within the scope of the indictment.&quot;   I've had more than a half dozen meetings with Mr. Wallachsince his conviction. His sunny disposition does make himseem more &quot;quixotic&quot; -- his preferred self-description --than anything else. He was stunningly naive about Wedtech,but he wasn't the one who pillaged the firm, bribedcongressmen or confessed to perjury. He doesn't think he gota fair trial. Probably no fair trial was possible onceprosecutors decided to use RICO.   Mr. Wallach remains a busy memo writer. In one not longago he wrote me this &quot;j'accuse&quot;:   &quot;What happened to me is a dire and really unforgivablecommentary on what has happened to both the world of themedia and the criminal justice system. You may think thatoverbroad, but I refer not only to myself but to multipleillustrations of lives destroyed. Due process is the trueheart of a viable democracy and it is now in jeopardy, as ithas been often in the past. There have been victims. Now thequestion is, from where will the redress come?&quot;   This is classic Wallach -- emotional, maybe somewhategotistical, to some even obnoxious. But Mr. Wallach's pleareflects genuine agony. He asks the right question, the oneabout redress, the one that only appeals judges can answer.</TEXT></DOC>
