Silence has surrounded most of the classified flight, but NASAdid interrupt the quiet briefly on Thanksgiving Day to announcethat the shuttle was scheduled to land at 7:02 p.m. PST Sunday atEdwards Air Force Base, Calif.   ``The crew is doing well and the orbiter continues to performsatisfactorily,'' Mission Control commentator Billie Deason said inthe brief status report Thursday evening.   According to sources close to the project, a 2{-ton, $300million payload was released from the shuttle's cargo bay earlyThursday morning about 10 hours into the flight.   It was a satellite capable of monitoring Soviet missile testsand eavesdropping on military and diplomatic communications in theSoviet Union and other countries, said the sources, who spoke oncondition of anonymity.   The satellite was to be maneuvered into a stationary orbit22,300 miles above the equator, on a line of sight to the SovietUnion, China, the Middle East, Africa and all of Europe.   The sources were unable to provide information on how thesatellite was operating. A similar satellite was launched by ashuttle crew in 1985.   They were expected to tend experiments for the ``Star Wars''missile defense system and other military projects.   The Defense Department has said the news blackout is necessaryto try to keep the Soviets from finding out about what theastronauts are doing.   Discovery is commanded by Air Force Col. Frederick D. Gregory.His four-person crew: Air Force Col. John Blaha, the pilot, and thethree mission specialists, Navy Capt. Manley Carter Jr., F. StoryMusgrave and Kathryn C. Thornton.   The flight, the fifth dedicated to the military, began Wednesdaynight with a spectacular nighttime liftoff that brightened the skyover the central Florida coast. The launch time was dictated by thesecret cargo and its mission.   On Thanksgiving Day, the astronauts dined on irradiated turkey,freeze-dried vegetables and cranberry sauce.</TEXT></DOC>
