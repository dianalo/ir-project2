The Soviet Union seized the territory in the closing days of thewar and has occupied them ever since. The so-called Northern Territories issueis a deeply emotional one to the Japanese public, and as a result, the twocountries have never signed a formal peace treaty ending the war betweenthem.;   &quot;The time has come to solve the conflict,&quot; acting chairman of theRussian parliament Ruslan Khasbulatov said. &quot;The two sides should not miss ahistorical chance.&quot;;   On Monday, Grigory A. Yavlinsky, vice chairman of thetransitional government, said the southern Kurils should be returned.;   UnderRussian control; The four islands, until recently a linchpin in the SovietUnion's Pacific military strategy, are under the jurisdiction of the far-flungRussian republic.;   In a letter from Russian President Boris Yeltsindelivered by Khasbulatov to Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, the Russianleader reportedly backed down from his previously rigid position on theislands. Only six month ago, Yeltsin was quoted as saying the territory would&quot;never&quot; be returned. More recently, he said the issue should be left to thenext generation of Russians and Japanese.;   Now, acknowledging that theRussian republic, and whatever else remains of the unraveling Soviet Union, isin desperate need of Japanese funds, Yeltsin seems to have shifteddramatically.;   &quot;We did not get the impression that the matter shouldcontinue to be left in the hands of the next generation after we heard Mr.Khasbulatov explain the position of the Russian republic contained in theletter from Mr. Yeltsin,&quot; Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe said.;  First official visit since coup; Khasbulatov is the first key official tovisit Japan since last month's failed coup in the Soviet Union. In April,Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev visited Japan in search of about $26billion in aid. But because of fears that any initiative on the islands mightincite independence-seeking republics, Gorbachev was unable to negotiate theterritorial dispute. Today, such concerns seem like ancient history.;   In ameeting with Ichiro Ozawa, former secretary-general of the ruling LiberalDemocratic Party, Khasbulatov urged the two sides to &quot;solve the contradictionbetween the time-requiring territorial dispute and the impending emergency aidproblem.&quot; According to a Japanese source, Ozawa said he believed that theseeming contradiction could be resolved.;   Nevertheless, Japan has yet tocome up with how -- and to what extent -- it is prepared to assist thefloundering Soviet economy. Minister of International Trade and IndustryEiichi Nakao told Khasbulatov that Japan could share its know-how gained fromrebuilding its war-devastated economy. But no figure was mentioned, and noneis expected anytime soon.;   According to opinion polls, about 70 percent ofJapanese believe that their government should be cautious in extending aid tothe Soviet Union.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  LEWIS M.
