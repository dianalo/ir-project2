The energy-loss spectrawere measured with the time-of-flight technique. The experimental resultswere analyzed by the classical trajectory calculation. The spectra measuredat small angles show a typical double-peak structure, while at largeangles the spectra are composed of the three peaks. The triple-peak structurecan be explained in terms of the rainbow effect on the angular momentumtransfer mechanism, by taking into account the direction of the finalrotational angular momentum vector. A drastic structural change of theenergy-loss spectra was observed around the reduced scattering angleof tau = 8 keV deg, independent of the collision energy. This can alsobe attributed to the rainbow effect arising from vibrational excitation.</TEXT></DOC>
