Wall Street started the day higher, adding to the strong gainsof recent sessions, but later retreated in edgy, volatile activity.   The National Association of Purchasing Management said today itsindex of the economy slumped to 46 percent in July, its lowestreading since an identical one in January 1983.   Also pointing toward slow growth was a Commerce Departmentreport on a decline in construction spending.   The department said construction spending in June fell 0.8percent, following a rise of 0.6 percent in May. The May increasehad originally been estimated at 1.3 percent.   The reports' release pushed the Dow Jones industrial averagelower, and the blue-chip indicator swung widely up and down throughthe rest of the trading session.   Stock investors are nervous that the market may have risen tooquickly and is due for a downturn. Monday's rally carried the Dowaverage to within 60 points of its record high, 2,722.42 on Aug.25, 1987.   Traders have been taking confidence from signs of declininginterest rates. But the economic slowdown that helps theinflation-sensitive bond market is not so good for the stock marketbecause slow growth could hurt corporate profits.   ``It's that balancing act,'' said Larry Wachtel, an analyst forPrudential-Bache Securities Inc. ``Of course we know the economyhas been softening, but bad news has been good news up to now.''</TEXT></DOC>
