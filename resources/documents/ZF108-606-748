 Kewill's financialdirector Richard Broad added however that the reduction, which will put totalstaff level at some 200, could be achieved in large simply by freezingrecruitment - the high staff turnover in the software sector should mean thatthe cuts come about relatively quickly through natural wastage, while someemployees will be given the chance to move to the more profitable areas ofbusiness.andP;  Within the group, Kewill's main business of providing themicro-based computer aided design system Micross rose by only 10% to #7.3m,mainly because many of Kewill's clients had by now installed the requiredhardware: accordingly, Kewill had seen a marked shift towards revenue fromsupport and service.andP;  Trifid Software, which was acquired by the group inNovember 1987 to supply minicomputer-based manufacturing systems to largercompanies, saw sales rise 30% to #5.0m, but has already begun to implementcost cuts as it is seen as being particularly vulnerable in next year'strading environment.andP;  Of the newly-acquired operations, only the start-upconsultancy Helix turned in losses, while Xetal Systems, which topped #1m inmanufacturing system sales to the clothing industry with pre-tax profit of#109,000, was expected to &quot;continue in its own modest way&quot;.andP;  Overstallinvested much hope for the future in Omicron Management Systems, acquiredMarch 1989 and contributing just over #2m in sales this time.andP;  Omicron iscurrently negotiating a large contract with an international company toinstall its Unix-based Xis ledger system set to be officially announced thisOctober; Sun Microsystems is also known to be competing for the deal with itsfuture Unix-based financial ledger offering, but Omicron managing directorMark Horne is convinced that the higher functionality of Xis will win throughdespite being about 20% more expensive.andP;  Horne is currently on the look-outfor companies with the expertise to distribute Xis, saying that of hispresent distributors, only 10 to 15 are in a position to do the job properly.andO;On the horizon for Kewill will be the fruits of its participation in thetwo-year EC project Esprit, through which Kewill has been given a grant ofECU850,000 (#600,000); Kewill's role in the project is to develop a systemcapable of building bespoke manufacturing control systems at off the shelfprices; whether or not the project will be completed will depend on whetherKewill gets the funding for a third year, which it originally estimated wasneeded for the venture - the EC decided that funding for the third year wouldhave to depend on performance.andP;  But the most exciting prospect for Kewillwill be the incorporation of HAN Dataport into the group, which by itselfwill see sales double to over #35m.andP;  HAN was acquired in April (CI No 1,386)and markets complementary products to Kewill mainly in German-speakingEurope.andP;  HAN also has distributorship deals with IBM in Luxemburg, Belgiumand Hungary, while Hewlett-Packard has been selling its products for sometime in the Soviet Union.andP;  Indeed, HAN's East European activity could turnout to the most interesting of all: its Soviet customers, after widespreadfinancial problems, have at last started coming up with the money for goodsreceived, and HAN already has a significant presence in Jugoslavia; bigthings in East Germany are also expected from the newly-opened Dresdenoffice.andP;  Moreover, one thing HAN is always likely to have in its favour issteady cash-flow.andM;Shortage of German salespeopleandM;Some time ago, it convinced its distributors that they should pay HAN a fixedmonthly sum for royalties regardless of sales; for those that meet theirtargets, HAN will offer discounts to make for bigger margins, while thosethat fall short are not entitled to claim back any of the monthlyinstallments they have paid to HAN.andP;  Perhaps surprisingly, HAN's main worryat the moment is that it can't find enough highly qualified German salespeople and has had to introduce its own graduate training scheme.andP;  In the US,the San Francisco-based manufacturing systems group Micro-MRP, which wasacquired by Kewill last December, contributed a &quot;satisfactory&quot; #161,000 tofinal quarter profits; a former distributor for Micro-MRP has pulled out ofits attempts to litigate against the company for the loss of its distributionrights.andP;  As a whole, Overstall stated that Kewill's plan for the next yearwas to concentrate on the computer integrated manufacturing market and lookat developing common interfaces between its various product ranges, whilemaintaining its yearly growth at 50%.andP;  Overstall was talking with &quot;one or twocompanies&quot; with a view to buy, but nothing was expected to come through inthe short term.andP;  Yesterday's results included good news for shareholders,with earnings per share up 38% to 27.1 pence, and the proposed dividend up50% to 4.5 pence.andP;
