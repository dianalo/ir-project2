In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the group said it holds 375,200 Exovir common shares for investment purposes.    The group's most recent transactions in Exovir stock include purchases of 88,050 shares Dec. 16 through Feb. 6 at $12.50 to $15.75 each and sales of 29,000 shares Jan. 22 through Feb. 6 at $13.375 to $15.50 each, the filing said.    According to the filing, the group may buy or sell additional Exovir shares in the future, depending on market conditions and other factors.    Officials of Exovir, a small biotechnology company based in Great Neck, N.Y., characterized the investor group's purchases as friendly and said no steps were planned to head off further purchases.    Thomas Ingalls, a vice president of Hammer Enterprises Ltd. and a member of the acquiring group, said that the group has gradually been accumulating Exovir stock since October 1985. Exovir, he said, is &quot;a little bit in the AIDS business, has a wrinkle cream, and has something going with Genentech. They have a lot going for them.&quot;    Maxwell M. Powell, Exovir's chief executive officer, said that the company progressed in its biotechnology research during 1986, but had no sales or earnings for that year. The company is &quot;still developmental,&quot; he said.    Exovir shares closed yesterday at $18, up $1.25, in national over-the-counter trading. </TEXT></DOC>
