These chemicals are used in industryand are found in varying concentrations in different parts of the environment,and present a number of health problems due to their chemical stability,lipophilicity, and toxicity. Hazards also depend on the relative compositionof the individual PCB compounds. Possible toxic effects include skinlesions, carcinogenesis, and the induction of diverse drug-metabilizingenzymes. In studies of aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase induction and toxicity,it is suggested that induction assays can be used as indicators of PCBtoxicity; monoortho coplanar PCBs have been identified as major toxiccomponents of PCB mixtures found in commercial PCBs and environmentalextracts. The effects of PCB and related compounds have been studiedby examining accidentally and occupationally exposed individuals, anddifferences in observed symptoms between the latter two groups have beennoted. Laboratory experiments comparing dose-response effects suggeststhat this difference is due to dibenzofurans, which are more active thanPCBs and relatively lower in level in commercial PCBs to which occupationalgroups are exposed. This in turn suggests that environmental risk assessmentshould be extrapolated from epidemiological investigation of occupationallyexposed individuals. 9 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
