(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Six years ago Andrew Dice Clay wasbanished from the Las Vegas Strip after one performance because hisact was too raunchy.   But the Diceman returneth. Clay had three sellout shows atBally's resort last week and if Dice fans were fearful of himcleaning up his act, they need not have worried.   One woman in the front row became a target for the evening ofsexually explicit shots by the comedian as he graphically describedhis sexual appetite and questioned hers.   Clay said he considers himself ``greatest comic that everlived.''   ``I've created something so unique, so special, people are justgoing crazy for it,'' Clay said. ``I'm going to be around for along time.''   He wasn't so confident six years ago when he was bounced fromthe lineup at the Comedy Store at the Dunes Hotel, across the Stripfrom Bally's, because of his foul language.   He vowed he would be back and would someday see his name on themarquee of one of the Strip's glitzy resorts. He realized that goalwhen he returned Thursday.   ``I figured the town just wasn't ready yet,'' he said of hisfirst experience with Las Vegas.   When it comes to Dallas, however, Clay apparently feels thatcity isn't ready for him. He canceled his Dallas concert becausehe's afraid of violating Texas' strict anti-obscenity law, hispublicist said Friday.   Michael Levine said Clay canceled the show, scheduled forSunday, because ``we feared the possibility that Dice might besubject to arrest, embarrassment and subsequently jailed.''</TEXT><DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn.
