The primary goal is to determine the effects of environmenton toughening, strength, and crystal structure in commercially availabletransformation toughened ceramics. Emphasis is focused on understandingthe mechanisms responsible for environmentally induced strength degradationand crystal changes in the temperature range 25{sup 0} to 1050{sup 0}C.The information and insight obtained from this program will be used toevaluate long-term applicability of toughened zirconia as diesel enginecomponents.</TEXT></DOC>
