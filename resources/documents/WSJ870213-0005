Webb ExpectsLower Profit or LossFor the First Quarter</HL><DD> 02/13/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> WBB </IN><DATELINE> PHOENIX, Ariz.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Del E. Webb Corp. said it expects sharply lower profit or a loss for the first quarter.    The real estate developer and casino operator attributed the prospective drop to poor conditions in southwestern real estate markets and to increased competition in the casino business.    In the first quarter last year, Del E. Webb had net income of $3.5 million, or 42 cents a share, on revenue of $59.7 million.    Robert K. Swanson, chairman, president and chief executive officer, added that profit for the year may be lower than in 1986. He cited a number of reasons, including the difficulty this year of matching profits made last year from certain large real estate transactions.    In 1986, Del E. Webb had profit of $19.6 million, or $2.37 a share, on revenue of $282.2 million.    Del E. Webb shares closed yesterday at $20, off $1.875, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. </TEXT></DOC>
