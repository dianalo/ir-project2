The agreement, signed as expected yesterday in Moscow, is the most significant of 30 private contracts scheduled to be signed by West German businessmen accompanying Chancellor Helmut Kohl on his summit trip to Moscow. As the first sale of a nuclear reactor since the Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986, it is also a big coup for the new West German venture.    Analysts estimate the value of the seven-year project at more than one billion marks ($555.3 million). The Siemens-Asea share of that total could be several hundred million marks, sources said.    The agreement still has to be cleared by Cocom, the 16-nation Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls that approves technology sales to the Soviet bloc. </TEXT></DOC>
