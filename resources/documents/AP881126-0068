Iraq's oil minister, Issam Abdul Raheem Chalabi, crossed hisfingers when reporters asked him to describe the prospects of theaccord worked out by the 13-nation Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries.   Gholamreza Aghazadeh, the Iranian official, made a quick trip toTehran to consult with government leaders before accepting thepackage.   ``He is still optimistic,'' said an Iranian delegate, who was incontact with Aghazadeh on Saturday morning. The delegate demandedanonymity.   The other oil ministers postponed resumption of their wintermeeting from Saturday evening to Sunday to give Iran time toconsider the plan.   IRNA, the official Islamic Republic News Agency, reported fromTehran that Aghazadeh said the nation's response will be announcedSunday.   The news agency quoted the minister as saying he would talkSaturday to the heads of the executive, legislative and judiciarybranches of government. The report said he would discuss the matterin a Cabinet session Sunday.   ``Then we will inform OPEC of Iran's decision,'' he was quoted assaying.   The proposed deal would trim current production by about 4million barrels a day from the present 22.5 million barrels to 18.5million barrels in the first six months of 1989.   It also would retain the cartel's benchmark of $18 a barrel.   Prices have been running $4 or so below that because of a marketglut. The new accord is aimed at curbing overproduction and raisingprices.   IRNA quoted Aghazadeh as saying the new production ceiling wouldboost prices to a range of $16 to $18 a barrel.   Each one dollar rise in the price of crude oil theoreticallymeans an increase of 2.5 cents a gallon in retail gasoline prices,although oil companies do not always pass along the full increase.   The ministers began their winter meeting Monday, then adjournedfor closed-door talks to try to end a bitter dispute between rivalsIran and Iraq. The two nations signed a cease-fire in August thatended their 8-year-old war, a conflict both paid for with revenuesfrom oil exports.   Iraq had been demanding an equal production ceiling with Iran inany new accord. Aghazadeh had repeatedly said no.   But under the new accord Iran and Iraq would get the same quotaof 2.64 million barrels a day.   Iran would retain its production share at 14.27 percent of totaloutput. Other countries would give up some of their share to bringIraq up to the same level as Iran.   Saudi Arabia maintains the largest share at about a quarter ofthe cartel's total output.   Under the current accord, Iran has a cap of 2.4 million barrels aday. Iraq was given a ceiling of 1.5 million barrels butignored it.Analysts estimate its production at 2.7 million barrels a day.   OPEC members are Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq,Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emiratesand Venezuela.</TEXT></DOC>
