(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The decision by leaders of JimmySwaggart's denomination to have Louisiana officials rethink theirproposed three-month suspension of the TV evangelist has increasedpressure on the church, a spokeswoman says.   ``The longer it goes without reaching a conclusion, the morequestions we have from our own members and our pastors,''Assemblies of God spokeswoman Juleen Turnage said Friday. `Itcreates a hardship on that pastor of the local church, whosecongregation is saying `Hey, what's going on and why is this takingso long?'''   Swaggart tearfully confessed to unspecified sins from his pulpitSunday in Baton Rouge, La., and an admitted prostitute said ininterviews this week that she had performed lewd acts for Swaggartfor about a year.   G. Raymond Carlson, general superintendent of theSpringfield-based Assemblies of God, the nation's largestPentecostal denomination with 2 million U.S. members, refusedFriday to say what penalty the church recommended for Swaggart.   CBS News reported that the church's Executive Presbyery toldleaders of the Louisiana district to order Swaggart to step downfor a year. The network cited no sources for the report.   Church executives met here for 11 hours over two days toconsider a tougher penalty after many members called Assemblies ofGod headquarters to complain that a three-month suspension frompreaching was too lenient. The Louisiana council also recommendedSwaggart receive counseling during a two-year rehabilitation.   Mrs. Turnage said the headquarters was still receiving hundredsof phone calls from people ``asking questions, voicing opinions.People that are hurting, needing prayer, counseling and comfort.We're anxious for that to get behind us too.''   Once the Louisiana district has reviewed the Swaggart case, theExecutive Presbytery will take it up again, Carlson said, adding afinal decision could be several days or weeks away.   Church officials say no other minister accused of moralmisconduct has been allowed to return to preaching in so short atime as three months.   Critics have noted that three members of the board of JimmySwaggart World Ministries and Swaggart's co-pastor are on theAssemblies state governing council, which receives financialsupport from the evangelist's organization.   Council member F.C. Chamberlain of Shreveport said Friday thatthe state leaders felt Swaggart's case should be handleddifferently ``when he made a complete confession.''   Chamberlain acknowledged that he was a close friend ofSwaggart's for many years, but denied any favoritism. ``I wouldlike to think this district would want to do what is right foreveryone,'' he said.   Swaggart, who has not appeared in public or commented since hisconfession, reaches around the world with broadcast sermons andcontributes $12 million a year to the foreign missions programs ofthe Assemblies of God.   It is the second time in a year that the Assemblies of Godconsidered disciplinary measures against a prominent ministercaught in a scandal. Last year, PTL founder Jim Bakker lost hisAssemblies credentials after it was disclosed he had had sex with awoman other than his wife and then tried to pay her to keep silent.Bakker rejected a rehabilitation proposal.   Mrs. Turnage said the Swaggart case is the most complex ever forthe Executive Presbytery because of the many facets of Swaggart'sministry, including gospel albums, Bible study tapes and televisiontapes.   `In the past, preaching meant going into the pulpit,'' she said.But with Swaggart, ``Is his singing going to be consideredpreaching? I don't know.''</TEXT></DOC>
