Yesterday, Venezuelan officials expanded their call for a meeting of the price-monitoring committee of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, proposing an emergency conference of all 13 members. They also suggested sharp production cuts by both OPEC and non-OPEC exporters in the second quarter to counter falling prices.    Meanwhile, Hisham Nazer, the Saudi Arabian oil minister, who has been opposed to a special OPEC meeting, was reportedly traveling to Algeria to confer with his Algerian counterpart, who supports Venezuela in the push for an emergency conference.    And some eight non-OPEC oil producers -- including Mexico and China -- sent oil officials to a meeting today in London, hurriedly called by Egypt, to discuss steps to firm up world oil markets, which have been in disarray since December.    Although there is skepticism in the industry that OPEC members would agree to Venezuela's recommended 10% cut in second-quarter production, the Venezuelans were instrumental in negotiating December's compromise agreement for 1988 production quotas.    Should the OPEC members adopt Venezuela's new proposals, petroleum prices would stabilize, oil analysts said. &quot;If they were to cut back by that figure, it would bring the market back into balance, but they would have to stick to it for the whole quarter,&quot; said Michael Barry, a Petroleum Economics Ltd. analyst.    Petroleum Economics, a London consulting firm which counts some OPEC members among its clients, currently estimates OPEC production at 17.5 million barrels a day. That is down some two million barrels a day since December and within OPEC's production quotas for this year's first half. It is still too high, however, for current market requirements -- as indicated by the continuing high level of world oil inventories and this year's drop in oil prices of $3 to $4 a barrel.    But many oil forecasters look for a substantial increase in demand for OPEC oil in the second half of 1988. Petroleum Economics projects demand for OPEC oil for the full year to average 18 million barrels a day.    That figure is in line with Venezuela's predictions of oil demand. In interviews, Venezuelan officials said that they have been analyzing OPEC's alternatives in trying to balance world oil markets. On the assumption that there would be an emergency conference of all 13 ministers -- or at the very least a meeting of the five-member price-monitoring committee -- the officials said they probably would recommend a &quot;three-way approach&quot; to the pricing problem.    The Venezuelans would call on the 12 members sharing 15.1 million barrels a day to cut output an additional 10% for the second quarter. That would give Iran a new quota of 2.1 million barrels a day.    The second part of Venezuela's proposal would call on Iraq, which remains outside the OPEC agreement because of its war with Iran, to reduce its production, currently estimated at 2.5 million barrels a day, to the new Iranian level of 2.1 million.    Finally, the Venezuelans said they would propose a &quot;direct approach&quot; to selected non-OPEC producers for reductions totaling 500,000 barrels a day.    The Venezuelan officials are convinced that their proposals -- with OPEC production at around 16 million barrels a day for the second quarter -- would revive world oil markets. &quot;In the third quarter, we could very well go back to current levels because demand for OPEC oil in the third and fourth quarters should be above 18 million barrels a day,&quot; said Felix P. Rossi-Guerrero, Venezuela's governor to OPEC.    ---   Canadian Oil Prices Cut   CALGARY, Alberta -- Canadian oil refiners have cut crude purchase prices to their lowest levels since August 1986.    The four major refiners have all cut their purchase prices to 19.08 Canadian dollars a barrel ($15.22) for light crude oil at Edmonton, Alberta.    The four refiners are Petro-Canada, owned by the Canadian government; Imperial Oil Ltd., 70% owned by Exxon Corp.; Texaco Canada Inc., 78% owned by Texaco Inc.; and Shell Canada Ltd., 79% owned by Royal Dutch/Shell Group. Shell Canada cut its price by 71 Canadian cents from the previous posting while the other three refiners cut their prices by 46 cents.    That indicates the delivered price to Chicago, a major Canadian export market, would be about $16.25 a barrel, after taking into account transportation and other charges. Export prices aren't publicly disclosed but are believed to be close to the posted purchase prices. </TEXT></DOC>
