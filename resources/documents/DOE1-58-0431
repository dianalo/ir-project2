It is well accepted for postoperative follow-up of any vascularprocedure. The intracranial intravenous studies and renal studies requirefurther clinical work for confirmation of efficacy. The value of quantitationand dual energy and hybrid systems will require further experimentalwork to confirm their value for clinical radiology. The integration ofthese digital imaging techniques with other digital imaging modalitiesin diagnostic radiology departments is another avenue of study. Thisintegration allows convenient inexpensive storage of radiographic dataand results in timely appropriate data retrieval for proper radiologicconsultation and management.</TEXT></DOC>
