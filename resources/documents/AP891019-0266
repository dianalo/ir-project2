What are youcharging this guy with?''   A Hispanic cop, getting into the spirit, jumps up and confrontsher classmate.   ``What are you doing? That's my brother. He didn't do nothing.''   The laughter drowns out Bunting.   Bunting once gave a lecture to a group of mystery book writersand was deluged with offers to co-author a book.   Dr. Alan Goldstein, a psychology professor, says he was onceteaching a class about schizophrenics and their usual non-violentnature.   A cop-student asked: ``Would you like me to show the class thetwo bullet holes I have in my buttocks from one of thosenon-violent schizophrenics?''   Goldstein says that is one of the great strengths of John Jay.   ``We all learn to be tolerant and we learn from each other.''   Meanwhile, back in the ivory tower part of the school, freshmenare wrestling with an English literature survey course, basicmathematics, speech, government 101, much like students at anycollege. Half of their credits must be in traditional liberal artscourses, but even those have a criminal justice flavor.   ``Sometimes, we wish their interests were broader,'' says Dr.Dorothy Bracey, head of the anthropology department and an experton international policing, particularly the criminal justice systemin China. ``But, in another way, it makes it easier to teach here.In theory, all students have some interest in criminal justice.''   Forty percent of Jay's students come from families that earnunder $12,000 a year. They are older than most college students andmost of them work. About 80 percent receive some sort of financialaid.   The undergraduates are 36 percent black, 32 percent white, 28percent Hispanic. Almost half are women.   Due to finances, about a fourth graduate in four years. Withwork and aid, almost three-fourths stick out 10 to 14 semesters tograduate.   Still, about 500 students get their baccalaureates each year.   The staff includes Olga Ford, a retired New York City detective.She has worked as technical adviser for TV shows. There was areported contract out on her when she helped bring down drugkingpin Nicky Barnes.   As head of the internship program and knowing the reality ofpolicing, she advises students: Don't take internships with privateindustry security men who are armed, never ride in a radio car,never visit a parolee, never walk with a cop to and from theprecinct.   There's Dr. Ansley Hamid, an anthropology professor whospecializes in crack-related violence and street gangs andmaintains that crack is not as instantly addictive as it is beingportrayed.   ``The dealers are controlled users, or sometimes abstinent, andI recently met an 80-year-old grandmother, who has no previoushistory of alcohol or drug abuse, who is a controlled user,'' Hamidsays.   ``Crack just came on us so fast, there was no time for a body ofexperiential users to teach others. Now people are coming up withstrategies for recreational use of crack. They might mix a littlewith some marijuana, for instance.''   Is this a rather benign view of crack?   ``Not benign,'' says Hamid, ``just a business-as-usual view ofunderground economies.   ``The real danger is the destruction of families and crack doesthe footwork. The marijuana dealer lasted a long time. Eventuallyhe bought a small bakery or maybe a boutique in the neighborhood.With crack, the money doesn't stay here.   ``The crack dealer doesn't last long. He is either arrested,killed by the competition or he becomes a crack head himself. Butwhen he has the money, he conspicuously consumes, buying fancyimported cars and jewelry. The money doesn't go back into thecommunity that generated it.''   Over at the Criminal Justice Center, there is William McCarthy,retired New York City detective. With the code name ``Mother,'' hewas once the undercover owner of two houses of prostitution. Ashead of the bomb squad when he retired, he was known as ``BillyBombs.''   Now working on his doctorate, McCarthy says: ``If it weren't forJohn Jay, I would never have gotten my bachelor's and master'sdegrees. Back then, it was the only place a cop could go.''   In the next office sits William Louden, also working on hisdoctorate. Louden was the NYPD's chief hostage negotiator.   Psychology professor Charles Bahn likes to tell about the FBIman in a public service administration course. The professorlectured that changes in top leadership should occur at least every10 years. Loyal to long-tenured J. Edgar Hoover, the FBI manchallenged that. So the professor assigned him to write a paperjustifying his point of view.   Working at his office, the FBI man did some research on the prosand cons of Hoover's long stewardship, pitching the carbons intothe waste basket where another agent found them. The FBI-authoragent was greeted the next morning by two FBI agents who announcedhe was under investigation.   He explained to the department that this was not a plot. It washomework.   An angry Hoover was on the telephone immediately to John Jay:``What are you going to do about that professor who is trying toundermine me?''   ``I'll tell him you called,'' was the reply of a school thatwill not suffer intimidation.</TEXT><NOTE>END ADV</NOTE></DOC>
