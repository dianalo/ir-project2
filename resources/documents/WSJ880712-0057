Thornburgh Is Asked to Succeed Meese, Source Says </HL><AUTHOR> Ellen Hume and Andy Pasztor (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> WNEWS </CO><G> JUS EXE </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The White House has asked former Pennsylvania Gov. Richard Thornburgh to succeed Edwin Meese as attorney general, according to a person familiar with the offer.    White House counsel A.B. Culvahouse offered the job to Mr. Thornburgh, an experienced prosecutor with strong ties to the moderate wing of the Republican Party, and &quot;he is prepared to accept&quot; as early as today, according to the source.    While Mr. Reagan hasn't met with Mr. Thornburgh yet, they are expected to meet at the White House today to seal the agreement, the source said. A formal announcement is expected shortly. Mr. Thornburgh, currently director of the Institute of Politics at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, was in the capital yesterday, but declined to comment.    The president's choice appears calculated to present the Senate with a wellknown, politically tested nominee unlikely to face a lengthy or bruising confirmation battle. Mr. Thornburgh's selection is good news for the presidential campaign of Vice President George Bush, who is believed to have pushed Mr. Thornburgh's nomination over more conservative candidates, including Interior Secretary Donald Hodel, advocated by Mr. Meese.    Mr. Bush's supporters clearly hope the 55-year-old Mr. Thornburgh will provide a new image for the Justice Department, which has suffered under the cloud of Mr. Meese's legal and ethical problems for more than a year. Mr. Thornburgh was a federal prosecutor in Pittsburgh, head of the Justice Department's criminal division in the mid-1970s and later a respected two-term governor. He has a reputation for strong management skills and aggressive pursuit of white-collar crime and ethics violations by public and business officials.    Mr. Bush has said that if he likes the nominee and is elected president in November, he would likely keep the new attorney general in place. But Mr. Bush hasn't made any such arrangement with his old friend Mr. Thornburgh, according to people close to the two men.    Mitchell Daniels, former White House political director, said yesterday that, for the Republican party, Mr. Thornburgh is &quot;the right kind of person&quot; to head the Justice Department in an election year because he comes from a politically important state and has an &quot;unassailable&quot; personal reputation.    White House aides declined to confirm that a job offer was made, but Senate aides said a number of Republican lawmakers were sounded out about Mr. Thornburgh and expressed support for him.    Strategists for Mr. Bush, whose campaign has been dogged by questions about Mr. Meese's ethics, urged a speedy decision on a successor after the attorney general's announcement last week that he intends to leave office by early August.    Friends and associates said that since he stepped down as governor in 1987, Mr. Thornburgh has maintained close ties to the Reagan administration and talked about returning to public office. He previously turned down feelers from Mr. Reagan to become director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and was said to be considering a possible bid to return to the Pennsylvania statehouse or to run for some other office.    Mr. Thornburgh, who rose to prominence for his prosecution of organized crime, drug trafficking and public corruption in Pennsylvania, later prompted controversy as an Assistant Attorney General in the Ford administration. He increased the size and the independence of U.S. Attorneys offices around the country and reduced the role of criminal division lawyers at headquarters.    As governor, Mr. Thornburgh was credited with helping improve the financial condition of Philadelphia's hard-pressed public school system, encouraging the federal government to help clean up the crippled Three Mile Island nuclear power plant and controlling increases in state spending. He also championed controversial proposals intended to reduce the state's welfare rolls.    Despite his middle-of-the-road reputation on many social issues, conservatives generally were supportive of Mr. Thornburgh. Daniel Popeo, general counsel of the conservative Washington Legal Foundation, predicted that Mr. Thornburgh wouldn't change the Justice Department's agenda significantly because &quot;those are the terms under which anyone accepts a Cabinet position&quot; in this administration.    ---   Jill Abramson contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
