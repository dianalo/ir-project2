Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said Fridayas the Senate approved the legislation on a voice vote and attachedit to a $17.3 billion money bill for the Commerce, State andJustice Departments.   A move to table, or kill, the measure was defeated, 50-41   The 435 seats in the House of Representatives will bereallocated among the states following the 1990 census, with themost populous states as always getting the most seats.   Thus lawmakers from states with few illegal aliens would like tosee them omitted from next year's count.   The measure sponsored by Sen. Richard C. Shelby, D-Ala., wouldbar the use of funds contained in the Commerce Departmentappropriation for counting the illegals in the census.   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said some states wouldlose congressional seats because they have few illegals.   ``This policy simply does not make any sense,'' Dole said.   Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., said, however, that a number ofurban areas are making sizeable expenditures on schools and healthcare because of their high concentration of illegal aliens. Federalaid to these areas would be decreased if they were not counted,Wilson said.</TEXT></DOC>
