An energyof a few tens of MeV per nucleon is the limit between two different regimesof nuclear reactions. The characteristics of the changing collision mechanismare detailed in these lectures, particularly through information collectedduring the first five years of operation of Ganil. Then a synthesis ofnew nuclear species in intermediate energy heavy ion reactions is given.</TEXT></DOC>
