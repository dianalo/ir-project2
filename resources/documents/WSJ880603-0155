These days the unanimous answer from France's businessmen, politicians, celebrities and plain citizens alike is oui.    Braving the rain and the parliamentary election campaign, they are arriving in droves for what has become one of the social events of the year-the French Open, better known here as Roland Garros, after the name of the stadium where the matches are played.    Commented one businessman: &quot;If you're looking for someone important, you're better off calling Roland Garros than calling his office.&quot;    In fact, during the two weeks of the tournament, many businesses transfer part of their operations to Roland Garros. Business lunches take place in the hospitality tents set up along the courts, and contract negotiations continue between shots in the center-court boxes that companies rent to allow their guests to watch a bit of tennis after lunch. (Some stay until dinner and have their evening meal there, too.)    The sojourn can be expensive, with some tents costing about one million French francs ($173,000). But it can pay off. One result of contacts made at the open was last year's huge asset swap between General Electric Co. of the U.S. and Thomson S.A. of France.    &quot;The first contact between Gomez and Welch took place at Roland Garros,&quot; says a Thomson spokesman, referring to Thomson Chairman Alain Gomez and GE Chairman John Welch. The asset swap was said to be valued at between $500 million and $1 billion.    On a recent afternoon, while those watching the matches saw France's Yannick Noah lose to Spain's Emilio Sanchez in five sets, those gazing at the crowd peered into another galaxy: In one center-court box sat Jacques Calvet, the chairman of car maker Peugeot S.A.; on the other side of the court was Jean-Rene Fourtou, chairman of Rhone-Poulenc S.A., the chemicals, pharmaceuticals and textiles group. In one corner sat film star Jean-Paul Belmondo; in the opposite corner was the much-courted centrist politician Simone Veil.    And then there was the presidential box, where observers could spot one junior government minister, Georges Sarre, and the finance minister's chief of staff, Alain Boublil.    So that's where they are when they say they're in an important meeting? Well, to be fair, it was a Sunday afternoon. But many of these people, or others of the same ilk, are there during the week, too. Some to watch tennis. Some to be watched watching tennis. And some -- like this reporter -- because, they say, it's part of their job.    Certainly, tennis tournaments everywhere attract highflying crowds, and corporations lavishly cater to their best clients annually at Wimbledon in England. But in France, no other sporting event brings out such a high-powered crowd.    &quot;We're not here to make our executives happy,&quot; explains Corinne Bouygues, in charge of public relations for Bouygues S.A., the big construction company founded and run by her father, Francis Bouygues. &quot;We're here to do business in a relaxed atmosphere.&quot;    Miss Bouygues was seated in the company's &quot;public relations space,&quot; as it calls its tent along center court. Bouygues was allotted the tent this year after years of trying to get it and uses it to invite major clients or bankers to drum up business. &quot;It's top-level public relations&quot; says Miss Bouygues, who estimates the cost for the two weeks at 650,000 francs, including tickets to the matches.    That's the minimum. The Bouygues tent isn't in what Miss Bouygues calls &quot;the top of the top&quot;: Le Village, a small row of tents isolated from the courts whose access is strictly limited to those wearing badges and bearing invitations from one of the 17 companies that have been willing to spend about one million francs to set up shop there.    The cost doesn't scare too many people away. The chances of getting a tent in the village are &quot;very slim&quot; says Gilles Bertoni, Roland Garros's director of marketing and development. &quot;The waiting list is long.&quot; Since 1980, when the village was created, most of the companies have renewed their contract for a tent each year, so there are few vacancies. This year, only one newcomer was allowed in after years of being on the waiting list -- the Perrier mineral-water company. &quot;Getting a tent in the village is a real racket,&quot; moans one disgruntled public official.    Is it all worth it? Companies say yes. While Peugeot's Mr. Calvet says &quot;you can't measure the effect of inviting people to Roland Garros&quot; in terms of sales, many companies say the unbusinesslike atmosphere helps to establish friendly relations that ultimately pay off, as with the Thomson-GE asset swap.    &quot;The density of senior executives per square meter here makes it inevitable that contracts are born here,&quot; says Mr. Bertoni.    But still, there seems something almost naughty about going out to Roland Garros, even if it is to negotiate a mega-deal. &quot;When a businessman is out there, his secretary won't say he's at Roland Garros,&quot; says the Thomson spokesman. &quot;She'll say he has an appointment and isn't in the office.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
