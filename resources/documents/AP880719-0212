Jesse Jackson promised an emotional, late-night finale tohis remarkable primary campaign.   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy said it was about time for anotherpresident from Massachusetts and scorned Bush as a ``hear-nothing,see-nothing, do-nothing vice president'' who ``wasn't there, orcan't recall, or never heard'' of the Iran arms sale.   On that and other issues, Kennedy said, ``I think it's fair toask, where was George?''   ``George Bush is the man who is never there _ and he won't bethere after the clock strikes noon on Jan. 20, 1989,'' the senatorsaid in a prepared address that kicked off the prime-timespeechmaking.   Jim Hightower, the tart-tongued Texas agriculture commissioner,called Bush a ``perpetual preppie,'' and said, ``He's a toothacheof a man, telling us to stay the course and threatening to lead usfrom tweedledum to tweedledummer.''   ``He is a man who was born on third base and thinks he hit atriple,'' he said for good measure during what was billed as apresentation of platform material.   The verbal abuse came after an afternoon of platform work inwhich Dukakis sought to shed the ``tax and spend'' Republicantaunt. He easily defeated Jackson's call for higher taxes onwealthy individuals and corporations. The vote was 2,499 to 1,091.   Dukakis prevailed as well on Jackson's call for a ``no firstuse'' pledge of nuclear weapons. Jackson's call forself-determination for Palestinians was debated and withdrawn.Jackson forces took the inevitable defeats with equanimity; therewas little of the past emotion over Democratic ideals.   Kennedy was introduced by his 27-year-old nephew, John F.Kennedy Jr., son of the late president. ``For a long time I havebelieved that what this country needs is another president fromMassachusetts,'' said the man who tried but failed to win the partynomination in 1980.   ``Now it's going to happen. President Dukakis, it has a nicering.''</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
