said Robert Maxey, Index'sprincipal for publications.andP;  &quot;This means we wouldn't be delaying a productrelease while waiting to finish updating and publishing documentation.&quot;andM;Index chose and designed an initial electronic publishing system built arounda proprietary platform from Xyvision, also of Cambridge.andP;  Index's currentinvestment of $300,000 includes Xyvision's Integrated Publishing Systemsoftware with an Advanced Production Services option that includescomposition, layout and magazine software; a raster editor and 2-D graphics;four WYSIWYG terminals; two 300MB disk drives, one for text and the other forgraphics; the Unix operating system; and a 1,000-dot-per-inch (dpi) model5100 image setter from Varityper, a Tegra company in East Hanover, N.J.andM;&quot;A company task force had projected producing 3,500 pages of camera-readycopy in 1986, but we actually finished 4,500,&quot; Maxey said.andP;  &quot;If we hadn't hadour electronic publishing system in place, we would have spent $122,500 forthe 3,500 projected pages.andP;  Instead, we wound up spending $9,000 on 4,500pages.andP;  These figures are exclusive of staff and equipment costs.&quot;andM;Maxey said Index chose Xyvision because Index wanted a system that wouldoffer the flexibility of doing a wide range of materials, from documentationto marketing brochures.andM;&quot;Xyvision enabled us to set up libraries of specs so we could declare a jobpath suited to a particular format.andP;  For example, if a writer wants to usematerial from documentation for a book, he doesn't have to recode theinformation.andP;  This saves time and money and decreases time to maket becausethe writer is not thinking format or doing page layout.andP;  He is focusing onwriting,&quot; he said.andM;Index plans to add a Xyvision networked media server this year to give thesystem more file transfer and graphi cs capabilities.andP;  Index's Unix-basedXyvision system will be linked to the company's PC local area network runningTCP/IP, which is linked to a corporate VAX.andP;  The VAX will connect about 45machines--including IBM ATs and PS/2, Compaq 386s, machines from SunMicrosystems and the Apollo Division of Hewlett-Packard, VAXstations andMicroVax IIs--to build a gateway to a repository of files that can be sharedby Index's domestic and European operations.andM;&quot;We are now producing prototype formats for all product deliverables,including reference guides, user materials and newsletters for customers andemployees,&quot; Maxey said.andP;  &quot;Our new system will be totally reusable.andP;  Writerswill have access to a read-only version of all final edits and, withpermission, will be able to use material that has already been created.andP;  Thishelps us produce our documentation and support materials on a timely basis,one that allows the fastest release of Index's products.&quot;andM;A LONG-TERM INVESTMENTandM;The desktop publishing strategy of New York-based Monday's Investors Serviceis an outgrowth of a five-year developed by Interconsult, a market researchand publishing strategy company in Arlington, Mass.andP;  According to BillKoppelman, assistant vice president and director of the DEC Data Center atMoody's, the plan provided that foundation for a clear growth path for thecompany's electronic delivery of investor services via videotext and CD-ROM.andM;Moody's electronic publishing system produces about 750,000 camera-readypages per year and has an opening budget of $2.5 million.andP;  It's supported by11 employees and is used by about 215 employees to prepare publishedproducts.andM;The system is based on DEC hardware because, as Koppelman put it, &quot;we wanteda system we coundn't and would allow us to use generic software in thefuture.andP;  Therefore, we wouldn't need to invest a lot of time rewritingapplications for new platforms.&quot;andM;The equipment consists of a database publishing application based on Oracle,Datalogics' Pager for production and composition, Datalogics' WriterStationsoftware running from a VAXcluster of two VAX 8550s and a VAX-11/785, 13.5GBof direct access storage devices linked via Ethernet to a Videocomp 570photocomposer and about 390 PCs or terminal emulators, three DEC LPS 40s andtwo LPS 20s, five Vanityper VT600s, two Apple LaserWriters, three QMS 638laser printers and two DEC LN03R printers.andM;Two Micro VAX IIs work within the network, one running LAN control, the otherrunning a specialized database for statistical analysis.andP;  Six VAXstation2000s are used: two for applications development outside of publications,database upgrade, videotext and development on CD-ROM; one for internal VMSand DEC applications with on-line Interleaf publishing software; one fornetwork control; one as a manager's console; and one for database prototypingand screen applications for published products.andP;  The Interleaf software isused to aid in the development and support of other in-house publications.andM;In addition, 13 Compaq 3820s run an analytical workstation applicationfunctioning as peer nodes in the LAN, and five PCs run on-line desktoppublication applications such as Xerox Ventura Publisher and Aldus Pagemaker.andO;A TCP/IP interconnect to an IBM 3380 via an Excelan Spartacus box allows filetransfers.andM;Moody's contracted with Chicago-based Datalogics to do the initial databasedesign.andP;  Generic code development cost $54,000; database structure anddesign, $180,000; and conversion of Moody's printer's mock-up language todata structures, $36,000.andM;&quot;Our original intent was to more efficiently manage the publication ofMoody's manuals,&quot; said Koppelman, who is also the founder and vice chairmanof the DECUS Special Interest Group in electronic Publishing.andP;  &quot;We projectedwe would save over $6 million in five years.andP;  But we are now 18 months aheadof our target budget.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
