The Federal Aviation Administration is considering new rulesthat would end parents' money-saving but dangerous practice ofcarrying infants on their laps during plane flights.   The agency isn't committed to requiring separate seats for youngchildren, but that is among a range of options being studied for anew child safety policy the FAA will recommend to theTransportation Department by the end of the year, an officialtestified Friday.   Donnell Pollard, the FAA's cabin safety specialist, was amongthe witnesses at a National Transportation Safety Board hearing onthe crash of the United DC-10 that crashed July 19 at Sioux City'sairport. There were 184 survivors.   Current FAA guidelines allow children less than 24 months old toride aboard an adult's lap, although the agency recommends thatinfants ride in a separate seat, strapped in a child safety seat.   ``We're considering a lot of factors,'' Ms. Pollard testified.``We have indications from the public that they like the option ofnot having to purchase a seat for children under the age of 2.''   Friday was the fourth and final day of the NTSB hearing on thecrash. The board is expected to issue a ruling on the probablecause next summer.   Experts believe a faulty rear engine fan disk split in twoduring flight, severing hydraulic lines that are essential forcontrolling the plane.   Evan was one of five unrestrained children aboard Flight 232,according to United spokesman Robert Doughty.   NTSB records show his mother, Sylvia Tsao, 30, was uninjured butthat Evan was killed when she lost her grip on him as the planesplit apart and burst into flames.   ``Suddenly the world seemed to end, and I saw for an instant myson's body floating and flying at a very high rate of speed downthe right aisle towards the back of the plane _ his head first, hisface away from me,'' Ms. Tsao told federal investigators whointerviewed her after the crash.   ``Infants, toddlers, young children's safety should no longer beignored as if they do not count,'' she added. ``If these kids needaircraft seats, then parents must be warned that they should putkids in them.''   Questioning Ms. Pollard on Friday, Fidel Gonzales of theAssociation of Flight Attendants union pressed for a commitmentthat the FAA toughen its standards for infant seating.   ``Isn't this a form of discrimination against those least ableto protect themselves?'' he asked.   ``We don't consider that discrimination,'' Ms. Pollardresponded. ``There is the option of purchasing a seat and coming onboard with an infant child restraint system.''   Most airlines allow parents who decline to purchase tickets forinfants to put the children in vacant seats, if available. However,few of the airlines provide child restraint seats, similar to thosemost states require in cars. The FAA issued an advisory in 1985that recommends use of child restraint seats in airplanes.   Doughty told reporters that United offers discount seats forinfants on flights that aren't full, and allows parents to bringchild restraint seats aboard for use in vacant seats.   Walt Coleman, vice president of operations for the Air TransportAssociation, an industry group representing major airlines,testified Friday that airlines have found many parents want to holdtheir infants in flight.   ``I think what we've done is transfer that responsibility to thepassenger,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
