On January1, 1989, the United States fully coverted to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule(``HTS''), as provided for in section 1201 <T3>et. seq.</T3> of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988.All merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption onor after that date is now classified solely according to the appropriateHTS number(s).Imports covered by this review are cellular mobile telephones (``CMTs''),CMT transceivers, CMT control units, and certain subassemblies thereof,which meet the tests set forth below. CMTs are radio-telephone equipmentdesigned to operate in a cellular radio-telephone system, <T3>i.e.,</T3> a system that permits mobile telephones to communicate withtraditional land-line telephones via a base station, and that permits multiplesimultaneous use of particular radio frequencies through the division ofthe system into independent cells, each of which has its own transceivingbase station. Each CMT generally consists of (1) a transceiver, <T3>i.e.,</T3> a box of electronic subassemblies which receives and transmitscalls; and (2) a control unit, <T3>i.e.,</T3> a handset and cradle resembling a modern telephone, whichpermits a motor-vehicle driver or passenger to dial, speak, and hear acall. They are designed to use motor vehicle power sources. Cellular transportabletelephones, which are designed to use either motor vehicle power sourcesor, alternatively, portable power sources, are included in this antidumpingduty order.Subassemblies are any completed or partially completed circuit modules,the value of which is equal to or greater than five dollars, and whichare dedicated exclusively for use in CMT transceivers or control units.The term ``dedicated exclusively for use'' only encompasses those subassembliesthat are specifically designed for use in CMTs, and could not be used,absent alteration, in a non-CMT device. The Department selected the fivedollar value for defining the scope since this is a value that it has determinedis equivalent to a ``major'' subassembly. The Department feels that a dollarcutoff point is a more workable standard than a subjective determinationsuch as whether a circuit module is ``substantially complete.'' Examplesof subassemblies which may fall within this definition are circuit modulescontaining any of the following circuitry or combinations thereof: audioprocessing, signal processing (logic), RF, IF, synthesizer, duplexer, powersupply, power amplification, transmitter and exciter. The presumption isthat CMT subassemblies are covered by the order unless an importer canprove otherwise. An importer will have to file a declaration with the CustomsService to the effect that a particular CMT subassembly is not dedicatedexclusively for use in CMTs or that the dollar value is less than fivedollars, if he wishes it to be excluded from the order.The following merchandise has been excluded from this order: pocket-sizeself-contained portable cellular telephones, cellular base stations orbase station apparatus, cellular switches, and mobile telephones designedfor operation on other, non-cellular, mobile telephone systems.Cellular mobile telephones and subassemblies were classified under TariffSchedules of the United States Annotated item numbers 685.28 and 685.33;they are currently classified under HTS item numbers 8525.20.60, 8525.10.80,8527.90.80, 8529.10.60, and 8529.90.50, 8542.20.00, and 8542.80.00. TheHTS numbers are provided for convenience and customs purposes. The writtenproduct description remains dispositive.The review covers four manufacturers and/or exporters of Japanese CMTsand subassemblies and the period June 11, 1985 through November 30, 1986.Fujitsu Limited (``Fujitsu'') failed to respond to the Department's antidumpingquestionnaire. The Department consequently used the best information availablefor assessment and antidumping duties cash deposit purposes. The best informationavailable was the highest rate from the fair value investigation, or 106.60percent.<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Comments Received</ITAG>We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminaryresults. We received timely comments from the petitioner, Motorola, andtwo respondents, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation and Japan Radio Company.Analysis of Mitsubishi Electric Company's (``MELCO'') Comments <T3>Comment 1:</T3> MELCO argues that the Department should use constructedvalue (``CV'') as the basis of comparison with the U.S. price of importedsubassemblies because the imported subassemblies are not ``such or similar''to the home market transceiver sold during the period of review. MELCObases this argument on the large difference in merchandise adjustmentsnecessary for the comparison. In addition, MELCO argues that the importedsubassemblies do not meet the Department's own criteria established inthe original investigation for determining similarity between the homemarket transceiver and the complete CMTs sold in the United States.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> The Department established in the investigationof sales at less than fair value (``LTFV'') (50 FR 45457, October 31, 1985)that the transceivers sold by MELCO in the home market were ``such or similar,''within the meaning of section 771(16)(C) of the Tariff Act, to the CMTsit sold in the United States. The Department has, likewise, concluded thatthe home market transceiver is ``such or similar'' to the CMT kit importedinto the U.S., since the kit is the equivalent of an unassembled CMT.MELCO's ``imported subassemblies'' are, in fact, complete or substantiallycomplete kits of cellular mobile telephones, or unassembled cellular mobiletelephones. MELCO itself describes these kits as ``semi-knockdown kits''consisting of subassemblies and parts for CMTs, from which complete CMTsare produced in the United States (MELCO's questionnaire response dated4/21/87, p. 30). In some cases, one subassembly may not be included inthe kits; in the remaining cases, all necessary subassemblies are included.In arguing that the transceiver sold in the home market during the periodof review is not similar to merchandise sold in the United States, MELCOrelies on comparisons with discrete subassemblies within the imported kitrather than on comparisons with the kit as a whole, on which the Departmenthas properly relied.In this regard, we find the Customs doctrine of entireties, while not controllingon the Department, to be a useful analogy. That concept treats as an entiretyseparate items which are imported together and are intended to be usedas a unit, or joined by assembly, with the result being that the individualidentities of the separate items are subordinated to the identity of theresulting combined entity. The nature, intended use, and description ofthe ``kits'' being imported by MELCO point to their treatment as an entiretyunder this analysis and we believe that such a result is appropriate here.See, <T3>e.g</T3>., <T3>Daisy-Heddon</T3> v. <T3>U.S</T3>., C.A.D. 1228 (1979); <T3>Miniature Fashions</T3> v. <T3>U.S., 54 C.C.P.A. 11 (1966); </T3><T3>Donalds LTD.</T3> v. <T3>U.S.</T3>, 32 Cust. Ct. 310 (1954).<T3>Comment 2:</T3> MELCO argues that the profit calculated for CV shouldbe that for the same ``general class or kind'' of merchandise. MELCO providedprofit data on a divisional basis, the wider universe of data requiredby the statute for the same general class or kind of merchandise.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> The statute requires the Department toinclude in constructed value an ``amount for general expenses and profitequal to that usually reflected in sales of the merchandise of the samegeneral class or kind as the merchandise under consideration * * *'' (section773(e)(1)(B) of the Tariff Act). The Department may, however, use a profitand selling, general, and administrative expense (``SGandamp;A'') figurefor a specific product when such data are more accurate or otherwise moreappropriate. In these final results of review, we have used MELCO's divisionalSGandamp;A and profit data because this was the level at which consistentinformation was available. Therefore, this method is more appropriate thanthat used in the preliminary results of review.In the preliminary results of review, the Department calculated a product-specificprofit by totaling the cost of materials and fabrication of the home markettransceiver with divisional general expenses, and comparing that figureto homemarket transceiver selling prices. However, because we are unableto determine precisely the transceiver-specific share of divisional generalexpenses, and because MELCO reported general expenses and profit consistently(<T3>i.e.</T3>, both based on the division's experience) and in the mostprecise manner allowed by its accounting records, the Department has revisedits CV calculation in the final results of this review to use the divisionalgeneral expense experience and profit information provided by MELCO. SinceMELCO's actual profit, however, was below the statutory minimum of eightpercent of the sum of the cost of materials, fabrication and general expenses,the statutory minimum of eight percent for profit was used.<T3>Comment 3:</T3> MELCO argues that some of the items it imported donot meet the definition of subassemblies covered by the scope of the orderand, therefore, it would be unlawful for the Department to assess antidumpingduties against these items, as the Department indicated would be done inthe preliminary results.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> The items referred to by MELCO as subassembliesnot covered by the scope of the antidumping duty order are imported aspart of a CMT kit; all items contained in the kit are properly within thescope of the antidumping order and subject to antidumping duties if soldat less than fair value. We have treated the kits imported by MELCO intheir entirety just as we have treated the kits sold by Japan Radio Company.The contents of a kit are considered as a whole, the whole being the functionalequivalent of an unassembled CMT subject to the antidumping duty order.(See also response to MELCO's Comment 1.)<T3>Comment 4:</T3> If constructed value is not used as the basis of comparisonwith the U.S. price of imported subassemblies, MELCO contends that a proportionof profit must be subtracted on the home market side to prevent the creationof artificial dumping margins. MELCO believes that such an adjustment isnecessary to offset the distortive effect of the large difference in merchandiseadjustment resulting from the higher cost of producing the home markettransceiver. In addition, since the Department deducted from the sellingprice of the CMT produced from the imported kit a portion of profit attributableto value added in the U.S., it should perform a corresponding adjustmentfor profit on the home market side.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> Because the difference in merchandise adjustmentwas not of sufficient magnitude to eliminate use of the domestic transceiveras a basis of comparison, the Department has no reason to adjust furtherfor profit as proposed by MELCO.The Department's allocation of profit or loss for the U.S. exporter's salesprice (``ESP'') sales does not mandate any similar deduction from homemarket price. The adjustment to the U.S. price in the case of ESP salesof goods which have been further manufactured serves only to allow a moreaccurate calculation of the U.S. price for the kit as imported, prior toany value being added in the U.S. It deducts profit allocable to the valueadded in the U.S., but does not deduct profit from the U.S. price beforethat value is added. Thus, the Department's comparison of U.S. and homemarket prices is in accordance with the statute (section 772 of the TariffAct), andSection; 353.41(e)(3) of the Department's regulations, publishedat 54 FR 12742 (March 28, 1989), and the Department's own consistent administrativepractice (see, <T3>e.g</T3>., <T3>Final Determination of Sales at LTFV; Color Picture Tubes from Japan</T3>,52 FR 44171, 44173 (November 18, 1987)). We therefore determine that thismethod is reasonable and accurate without further adjustments.<T3>Comment 5:</T3> MELCO claims that the Department should use an averagedifference-in-merchandise adjustment for price-to-price comparisons, onthe basis that it would more accurately reflect the actual pricing policiesof businesses. MELCO argues that job order to job order matching can resultin adjustments that are not reflective of MELCO's ``average'' pricing decisions,which are set to recover costs over time, not to recover costs for a particularjob order.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> In our final results, as in our preliminaryresults of administrative review, difference in merchandise adjustmentswere based on the difference between the cost for the job order in whichparticular kits or complete CMTs were manufactured and the cost of thehome market transceiver manufactured closest in time. The Department reliedon this information since it provides the most accurate measure of respectivecost differences between the merchandise being compared. Since differencein merchandise adjustments made on a job order basis constitute a reasonablyaccurate comparison insofar as costs in both markets at similar productionstages should be similarly affected. Any cost reduction trends over timewould apply to both home market and export models, as the evidence in MELCO'scase demonstrates.<T3>Comment 6</T3>: MELCO comments that the Department should average foreignmarket value over a period of six months or more, rather than using monthlyweighted averages, because the former method more closely matches the wayin which MELCO and other companies set prices, and would thereby avoidthe artificial creation or elimination of dumping margins solely due totemporary price or cost fluctuations in the home market.<T3>Department's Position</T3>: In accordance with section 773(a)(1), theDepartment seeks to compare U.S. price and foreign market value at timeswhich are as contemporaneous as possible. The Department therefore useshome market sales closest in time to U.S. sales for comparison wheneverpossible. Where there are no home market sales in the same month as theU.S. sale, we use home market sales made up to 90 days prior and 60 daysafter the U.S. sale. This practice is further designed to utilize homemarket sales taking place before the U.S. sale prior to utilizing thosethat take place after. This prevents, as much as possible, the seller beingunable to know what foreign market value will be at the time he sets hisU.S. price. We followed this practice with respect to MELCO and found contemporaneoussales. The Department therefore expects MELCO to set its U.S. price giventhis knowledge regarding foreign market value. Moreover, if MELCO choosesto set an average price, it can do so in both markets.<T3>Comment 7</T3>: MELCO argues that the Department should not have appliedthe ESP cap in the analysis of this administrative review since it is an``unneeded relic'' that improperly distorts the margin calculation by limitingthe indirect selling expenses to be deducted in the home market.<T3>Department's Position</T3>: The ESP cap limits the amount of the homemarket (or third country) indirect selling expenses deducted in the calculationof foreign market value to the amount of indirect selling expenses incurredon sales in the United States. The use of the ESP cap is provided for byandSection; 353.56(b)(2) of the Department's regulations and was previouslyprovided for by andSection; 353.15(c). The use of the cap is a well-establishedadministrative practice of the Department (see, <T3>e.g</T3>., <T3>Study of Antidumping Adjustments Methodology</T3>, (November 1985))and has been upheld by the courts as appropriate (see <T3>e.g</T3>., <T3>Smith-Corona Group v. United States</T3>, 713 F.2d 1568 (CAFC 1983);<T3>Zenith Radio Corp. v. United States</T3>, 783 F.2d 184 (CAFC 1986)).Although not relevant to our decision in this regard, for the majorityof MELCO's sales during this review, indirect selling expenses incurredin the sale of the U.S. merchandise were not exceeded in the home marketand therefore, for these sales, the ESP cap was not applied.<T3>Comment 8</T3>: Given the rapid decline in the value of the dollarduring the period of review and the long lag time between production andsale to unrelated parties, MELCO argues that the Department should applyan exchange rate other than the sale-date exchange rate applied by Commercein this case. MELCO advocates the use of the exchange rate in effect 90days before the date of sale for converting FMV to dollars and cites the<T3>Melamine</T3> case in support of its position. The use of the previousquarter's exchange rate is reasonable in this case since the period ofreview has been marked by a drastic and unpredictable decline in the valueof the dollar.<T3>Department's Position</T3>: The Department has applied the exchangerate certified by the Federal Reserve Board in all calculations in thesefinal results of review. The Federal Reserve certifies the quarterly exchangerate except in instances where the daily rate varies by at least five percentfrom the quarterly rate, in which case the daily rate constitutes the ratecertified by the Federal Reserve Board. These rates were applied in accordancewith the Tariff Act, as codified at 31 U.S.C. section 5151, and with andSection;353.60 of the Department's regulations.The Department's regulations provide for the application of exchange ratesother than the quarterly or actual daily rates only when certain specialcircumstances, such as volatile, or sustained, exchange rate changes, occurduring the period of a fair value investigation. However, no such provisionapplies in section 751 administrative reviews.<T3>Comment 9</T3>: MELCO requests the Department to instruct U.S. Customsto refund in full antidumping duties on which MELCO received a duty drawbackupon export of only 99 percent, and not to require payment of duties onitems not covered by the antidumping duty order, including replacementparts and subassemblies.<T3>Department's Position</T3>: As stated in our Final Determination ofSales at less than Fair Value (50 FR 45447, 45457, October 31, 1985), replacementsubassemblies are not covered by the antidumping duty order. However, itremains the responsibility of the importer to satisfy Customs that subassembliesare imported only for replacement purposes. Inquiries regarding duty drawbackshould be directed to the U.S. Customs Service, which administers the dutydrawback program.Analysis of Japan Radio Company's (``JRC'') Comments<T3>Comment 1:</T3> In calculating constructed value, Commerce should usethe profit attributable to all products of the same ``general'' class orkind of merchandise as JRC's U.S. CMT components. JRC considers certaintelecommunication equipment to be of the same general class or kind ofmerchandise as its CMT components sold in the United States; this is theprofit figure which they reported in their original constructed value response.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> In spite of receiving identical instructionsfor the reporting of SGandamp;A expenses and profit, JRC chose to reporteach differently. For its reporting of profit, which JRC now purports tobe attributable to the same ``general'' class or kind of merchandise asits CMTs sold in U.S., JRC relied strictly on its financial statement.However, if the Department calculates the general expenses of the companybased strictly on its financial statements (<T3>i. e.,</T3> on the same ``general'' class or kind of merchandise),a significantly larger percentage for SGandamp;A than that reported by JRCwould have resulted. The Department cannot accept differing methodologiesfor the calculation of general expenses and profit when, as is the casehere, the amount for general expenses varies so greatly from that whichwould have been obtained had identical methodologies been utilized. Moreover,when JRC was specifically requested to provide general expense informationon the class or kind of merchandise sold in the home market, JRC providedthe Department with a product-specific general expense amount. JRC couldhave used this opportunity to provide the general expense information inthe same manner as that reported for profit and which they now claim tobe for the same ``general'' class or kind of merchandise.For these reasons, the Department has determined that use of the product-specificSGandamp;A figure reported as well as the financial statement-based profitfigure would be inconsistent and distortive. The Department has, therefore,accepted the product-specific SGandamp;A amount reported for sales of domestictransceivers which JRC supplied while continuing to use the product-specificamount calculated by the Department for profit. We believe that this providesfor more reliable and internally consistent results than does the informationsupplied by JRC. <T3>Comment 2:</T3> The exchange rate for converting constructed valueto dollars for comparison with the U.S. sale made on November 28, 1985,is incorrect because it was based on the daily rather than quarterly exchangerate. The quarterly rate must be used in this case, JRC argues, since thereis no Federal Reserve certified daily exchange rate for the exact dateof sale, Thanksgiving Day, which varies from the quarterly rate by morethan five percent.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> The Department's statute and regulationsdirect it to use the exchange rate certified by the Federal Reserve Board.See andSection; 353.60 of the Department's regulations and 31 U.S.C. section5151(c). The Federal Reserve Board certifies the quarterly exchange rate,unless the daily exchange rate varies from the quarterly rate by more thanfive percent, in which case the daily rate is certified. See also the Department'sPosition in response to MELCO's Comment 8. Since the daily exchange ratefor the day before Thanksgiving varied by more than five percent from thequarterly exchange rate and was, therefore, the rate certified by the FederalReserve, the daily rate was used in converting constructed value to dollars.Because no Federal Reserve certified exchange rate was available for theholiday of Thanksgiving Day, we have used the rate in existence the daybefore the sales confirmation as a reasonable measure of the exchange ratethe parties may be deemed to have considered on the date of sale itself.Analysis of Motorola's Comments<T3>Comment 1:</T3> Motorola argues that the Department erred in its preliminaryresults by assigning Fujitsu its cash deposit rate of 57.81 percent asbest information available, claiming that the Department should have insteadused the highest margin in effect at the time for any company subject tothe antidumping duty order, or 106.60 percent. Motorola further arguesthat the incentive for companies to respond to the Department's questionnaireis severely diminished if the worst they have to fear is a continuationof their existing cash deposit.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> We agree with the petitioner that sufficientincentive through the appropriate application of best information available(``BIA'') should be utilized by the Department in order to encourage respondentcooperation and provide accurate dumping determinations. By failing torespond to the Department's questionnaire, Fujitsu made no attempt to providethe Department with information regarding their selling practices; thisfact should be taken into account in determining what constitutes bestinformation available for this manufacturer. We believe that, in such asituation, the best information rule is a rule of adverse inference (see<T3>Shop Towels of Cotton from the People's Republic of China: Final Resultsof Administrative Review of Antidumping Duty Order,</T3> (50 FR 26020,26022, June 24, 1985)). Fujitsu's cash deposit rate of 57.81 percent isthe ``all other'' rate from the original investigation, and does not reflectinformation specific to this manufacturer. Given the fact that Fujitsufailed to provide more accurate information, the Department must adverselyinfer that such information would, therefore, be detrimental to Fujitsu.Given these circumstances, the Department finds that the use of the highestrate of 106.60 percent from the fair value investigation is the appropriateapplication of best information available for Fujitsu.<T3>Comment 2:</T3> Motorola argues that the Department should use JRC'shome market sales of transceivers as the basis of FMV since the home markettransceivers of two other Japanese respondents, MELCO and NEC, were determinedby the Department in the original antidumping investigation to be ``similar''merchandise. Furthermore, aside from the cost differences detailed by JRCbetween its home market transceiver and the CMT kit sold for export tothe United States, little evidence has been provided to support JRC's contentionthat the two products are not ``such or similar.''<T3>Department's Position:</T3> In both the preliminary and final resultsof review, the Department has used constructed value as the basis of comparisonwith JRC's CMT kits sold for export to the U.S. The cost differences betweenJRC's home market transceiver and the U.S. product were verified by theDepartment and determined to be of such magnitude as to preclude a reasonablecomparison. As the Department stated in the <T3>Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value in Certain Internal-Combustion,Industrial Forklift Trucks from Japan:</T3><ITAG tagnum="21">It is the Department's practice to disregard home market sales asthe basis for foreign market value when the difference in merchandise adjustmentsclaimed are of such a magnitude as to lead us to question whether the homemarket sales reported can serve as an appropriate measure of foreign marketvalue. There are two basic reasons for this practice: (1) In determiningwhether U.S. sales are being made at less than fair value, we do not wantthe difference in merchandise adjustment either to falsely create dumpingmargins or to mask them; and (2) large difference in merchandise adjustmentsmay indicate that the home market sale is not similar to the U.S. sale,thus, warranting a new comparison (53 FR 12552, 12567, April 15, 1988).</ITAG>The cost differences existing between the transceiver and the CMT kit wouldhave meant adjusting by an amount which exceeded the entire cost of producingthe merchandise sold in the United States. An adjustment of such magnitudeis inherently sufficient to question the appropriateness of such a comparison.The Department has continued to use the home market transceiver as thebasis of foreign market value for MELCO, one respondent referred to byMotorola, consistent with the finding of similarity within the originalinvestigation, because the differences in merchandise adjustments for MELCOwere not of the same magnitude as those for JRC. (See also the Department'sresponse to MELCO's comment 1.)<T3>Comment 3:</T3> Motorola states that, since it requested in a timelymanner that the Department verify Nihon Dengyo's response, the Departmentis required by statute to conduct a verification before relying on thatresponse in issuing its final results of administrative review.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> In accordance with section 776 of the TariffAct, the Department conducts verification in an annual administrative reviewunder section 751(a) only when we receive a request for revocation froma respondent, when we receive a request for revocation from a respondent,when we receive a request from the domestic industry and have not conducteda verification during the two immediately preceding reviews and determinations,or when the domestic party has shown ``good cause'' for verifying the informationreceived during the administrative review (see andSection;353.36(a) of theDepartment's regulations and <T3>Color Television Receivers from Korea; Final Results of AdministrativeReview,</T3> FR 24975, 24978, (1988)). In the context of the first administrativereview, therefore, the Department retains discretion as to whether to verifya respondent's information since two preceding unverified reviews and determinationshave not as yet transpired. In reaching the decision not to verify thisrespondent, as was timely requested by the petitioner, the Department consideredthe substantial amount of detail and supporting cost documentation providedin Nihon Dengyo's questionnaire and supplemental submissions, and the factthat this information was also shown to be consistent with its auditedfinancial statements. Furthermore, the only reason offered by the petitionerfor requesting verification was that Nihon Dengyo had never previouslybeen verified. The Department, therefore, does not find ``good cause''for verification of Nihon Dengyo.<T3>Comment 4:</T3> Motorola states that the Department should set thecash deposit rate for Nihon Dengyo equal to that of Fujitsu, which acquiredmajority interest in Nihon Dengyo during the review period. This wouldbe in accordance with the Department's practice of establishing a singlemargin for related entities.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> The Department does not agree with thepetitioner that the administrative practice of the Department is automaticallyto establish a single margin for related entities based solely on the extentof their financial relationship. There are, in fact, additional factorswhich would contribute to a decision to ``collapse'' related producers(<T3>i.e.,</T3> to treat the two as a single entity). Such factors may includethe fact that the two companies involved are capable, through their salesand production operations, of manipulating prices or affecting productiondecisions. See <T3>e.g.,</T3> <T3>Final Determination of Sales at LTFV; Brass Sheet and Strip from France,</T3>52 FR 812 (January 9, 1987); <T3>Final Determination of Sales at LTFV; Granite from Spain,</T3> 53 FR24335 (June 28, 1988).The sales made by Nihon Dengyo during the review period were made priorto their acquisition by Fujitsu. Aside from the degree of financial interestheld by Fujitsu in Nihon Dengyo, we do not have sufficient informationto enable us to conclude that the parties do not operate separate and independentsales and production operations. For this reason, the Department will continueto set separate cash deposit rates for each manufacturer.<T3>Comment 5:</T3> Motorola argues that Nihon Dengyo's research and development(``Randamp;D'') costs were selectively allocated across different modelsresulting in a substantial allocation of such expenses to products soldoutside the period of review and to products sold during the period ofreview at higher costs. The Department should require the company to usea consistent amortization rule for these expenses.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> Although Nihon Dengyo reported its methodof allocating Randamp;D costs in the same manner as reflected in its booksand records, the Department agrees with the petitioner that an identicalallocation method would provide consistent treatment for similar expenses.Therefore, in our final results of administrative review, we have usedthe same allocation methodology for the development for all models.<T3>Comment 6:</T3> Motorola argues that the Department should considerthe general expenses and profit for the two respondents involved in thereview as reflective of the experience of producers of the same generalclass or kind of merchandise in the country of exportation. Therefore,the Department should use these amounts from the preliminary results ofreview, rather than the lower statutory minima, in calculating a CV forNihon Dengyo.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> In the final results of review, the Departmenthas used the statutory minimum for profit in calculating a CV for MELCO(see MELCO Comment 2). Irrespective of that fact, however, the generalexpense and profit experience of the two reviewed producers cast doubton whether there is a common industry experience in Japan, since the experiencesof these two producers are dissimilar for profit and general expenses.The use of the statutory minimum profit was upheld by the Court of InternationalTrade in <T3>Alhambra Foundry Co.</T3> v. <T3>U.S.,</T3> 685 F. Supp. 1252, 1260 (1988). Therefore, in the absenceof actual general expense and profit data for Nihon Dengyo, the Departmenthas continued to use the statutory minima for general expenses and profit.<T3>Comment 7:</T3> Petitioner argues that, despite the fact that the productsold in the U.S. by MELCO is a complete CMT unit with many advanced featureswhile the product sold in Japan is an incomplete unit with only moderatefeatures, the Department has nonetheless accepted the large differencein merchandise adjustment which reduces foreign market value. Instead,Motorola states that the Department should reject the difference in merchandiseadjustment reported by MELCO since the U.S. model should have a highermarket value than its domestic counterpart; therefore, its lower U.S. pricecannot be due to physical differences. Motorola further faults the differencein merchandise adjustment reported by MELCO alleging that MELCO has notproperly compiled or attributed all overhead costs. For example, engineeringand capital equipment costs above a set amount were not included in overhead.In addition, some Randamp;D was reported as an element of SGandamp;A.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> The petitioner's conclusion regarding therelative value of merchandise assumes that such a determination can bemade simply by comparing the number of features available for each model.Such a conclusion is not substantiated by the facts on the record. TheDepartment verified the differences in merchandise adjustment between U.S.and home market models reported by MELCO and determined that the amountreported was accurate and reflected actual cost differences based on differencesin physical characteristics between the U.S. and home market merchandise.Because a difference in merchandise adjustment accounts only for differencesin variable costs, capitalized costs such as MELCO's engineering, capitalequipment expenses, and general Randamp;D expenses (which are included asan element of SGandamp;A) are properly not part of this adjustment. For thesereasons, the Department has allowed the difference in merchandise adjustmentin its analysis.<T3>Comment 8:</T3> Motorola alleges that sales made by MELCO to a tradingcompany in Japan should be treated under the antidumping law as sales toa related party. Motorola argues that this is the proper determinationsince MELCO and the trading company are both members of the powerful MitsubishiGroup. As such, both are ultimately controlled in large part by a ``groupof persons'' through cross ownerships within the Group, financial inter-dependencies,inter-locking and coordinated directors and officers, and de facto operation.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> Motorola has not alleged that MELCO andthe trading company are related in any of the ways set forth in andSection;353.45 of our regulations which reference section 771(13) of the Act. Motorola'sclaim is similar to that of the petitioner in <T3>Television Receiving Sets, Monochrome and Color, from Japan,</T3> 50FR 24278 (June 10, 1985), who claimed that manufacturers and purchaserswere related by virtue of participation in the groups of the Japanese ``keiretsu''system. The Department rejected that argument, noting that ``the requirementsof the antidumping law are satisfied when the Department investigates whetherthere is a financial relationship between the seller and the buyer. Togo further and investigate non-financial relationships is not requiredby the Act.'' <T3>Id.</T3> at 24280. This reasoning was endorsed by the Court of InternationalTrade in <T3>Zenith Radio Corp.</T3> v. <T3>the United States,</T3> 605 F. Supp. 695 (CIT 1985). Therefore, wehave not treated these transactions as if they were between related parties.<T3>Comment 9:</T3> Motorola questions the amount of CMT sales revenueused by MELCO in allocating certain selling expenses during 1985 and 1986.Specifically Motorola points to the difference between that amount andthe total for CMT sales shown on MELCO's submitted sales listing.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> MELCO's sales revenue figure used for allocationpurposes appropriately includes all CMT sales_<T3>i.e.,</T3> sales of CMTs entered before and sold after the suspensionof liquidation; sales of CMTs manufactured in, and with parts from, theUnited States; and those CMTs covered by the antidumping duty order. Thelatter amount correlates with the specific sales being reviewed as indicatedon MELCO's sales listing.<T3>Comment 10:</T3> Motorola questions a wide variance in overseas shippingexpenses reported for MELCO's U.S. sales.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> MELCO's differences in freight expensesresult from the different quantities involved in shipments as well as thefact that some shipments were air-freighted while others were sent by sea.<T3>Comment 11:</T3> Motorola questions whether all parts imported by MELCOas part of a CMT kit are included in the analysis since MELCO's responsedistinguishes between ``non-covered parts'' and parts covered by the antidumpingduty order.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> The Department has not distinguished amongparts within MELCO's kit and has treated the kits as a whole. All costsassociated with each kit have been included in their entirety.<T3>Comment 12:</T3> Motorola questions the use of a uniform sale datefor a particular grouping of MELCO's sales since the sale terms do notappear to be fixed on that date.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> MELCO's contracts on the sale date in questionestablished the terms of sales including price, quantity and shipment schedule.Petitioner's question may stem from the fact that two sales prices forthe same CMT were set forth in separate contracts on that date. Contractsprovided to the Department by MELCO verify these facts. <T3>Comment 13:</T3> Petitioner faults the Department's value added adjustmentbecause it included losses attributable to U.S. inputs. <T3>Department's Position:</T3> In arriving at a U.S. price for MELCO'skit at the time of importation, the Department adjusts for all U.S. value-added,including any proportional loss attributed to U.S. value. This adjustmentis consistent with the statute, regulations, and the Department's administrativepractice. (See Department's Position on MELCO's comment 4.) <T3>Comment 14:</T3> Motorola argues that MELCO's start-up expenses forU.S. production were spread over projected capacity estimates that areexcessive. <T3>Department's Position:</T3> We disagree. The Department relied on threeyears of actual production experience in estimating the total five yearproduction volume for allocating MELCO's start-up expenses. Since productionduring the initial years of operation was significantly below capacity,it is not unreasonable for the Department to accept a moderate growth inproduction thereafter considering MELCO's projections remained below fullcapacity. Moreover, the average annual production for the five year period,using the Department's methodology, remains below the last year of actualproduction provided by MELCO. <T3>Comment 15: </T3>Motorola questions the average credit expense reportedby MELCO in 1986 because the financial statement shows interest rates whichwould produce a higher average than that reported. <T3>Department's Position:</T3> The interest rate derived by the petitionerresults from a simple average of the high and low amounts reported forpromissory rates from MELCO's financial statement. The average interestrate reported by MELCO is based on the average of actual borrowing ratesexperienced during the period by the company. Accordingly, we have usedthe interest rate reported by MELCO. <T3>Comment 16:</T3> Motorola questions whether the interest income allowedas an offset to MELCO's interest expense was attributable to CMT operations.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> The interest income claimed by MELCO asan offset to interest expense was for interest earned on compensatory balances.The Department does not require that such interest be exclusively relatedto the merchandise subject to review. Short-term interest income, suchas that earned on compensatory balances, which is related to the ordinarycourse of business, is accepted as an offset to short-term interest expense.(See <T3>Final Results of Administrative Review: Titanium Sponge from Japan,</T3>(52 FR 4799, February 17, 1988.)) No offset was claimed on long-term instrumentsor investment income that is generally not allowed as an offset by theDepartment.<ITAG tagnum="84">Final Results of the Review </ITAG>As a result of the comments received, and correction of clerical errors,we have revised our preliminary results, and determine that the followingmargins exist for the period June 11, 1985 through November 30, 1986:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s50,10</C> <H1/><T3>Manufacturer</T3><H1>Margin (percent)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Mitsubishi Electric Corporation<D>6.99</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nihon Dengyo<D>3.89</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Japan Radio<D>17.71</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Fujitsu<D>106.60</D></ITAG></ITAG> The Department will instruct the Customs Service to assess antidumpingduties on all appropriate entries.
