Three scenarioswere established that addressed probable environments for the gas supply/demandthrough 2010. In all cases, the bulk of natural gas used in U.S. willstill be produced in the lower 48 States. Significant results of theevaluation include: Gas will be available and reliable through 2010.By 2010, 25% of gas produced could come from nonconventional sources.Gas-fired cooling, cogeneration, and fuel cells may make an impact ongas demand by 2010. CNG vehicles are economically viable but will havelimited impact on demand unless much stricter legislation is passed.</TEXT></DOC>
