Owen Carney, director of the Comptroller of the Currency's investment securities division, said a few banks have failed and dozens have been weakened by unwise trading in arcane, risky securities.    The comptroller and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. issued warnings yesterday, and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board is expected to adopt a less stringent position soon.    The comptroller and the FDIC warned banks to be cautious about investing in certain high-risk securities: stripped mortgage-backed securities that provide the holder with only the principal or the interest from a package of mortgages; &quot;residuals&quot; on asset-backed securities; and stripped government securities providing only the interest or principal portions of government bonds.    Generally, the regulators said such investments can be used as effective means of hedging risks, but that they should be tried only by financial institutions with sophisticated research and enough capital to handle potential losses.    The agencies' circulars also warned against engaging in various short-term trading practices with long-term investment portfolio securities, which are carried on bank books at cost rather than at current market value. For instance, they cautioned against buying and selling securities in the interim between announcement of an offering and the date when they are issued and paid for.    If losses are incurred by such a practice in a trading account, they must be promptly recognized. Failure to do so can result in a misleading picture of the bank's financial position, the regulators said.    The regulators also expressed concern that some banks are buying securities and taking investment advice from unreliable broker-dealers. They urged selection of experienced sales representatives with reputable dealers that disclose their financial condition and have the capital to honor their commitments. </TEXT></DOC>
