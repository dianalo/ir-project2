Each of the existing Funds is a series company, registered under the1940 Act as an open-end, management investment company. The Funds are authorizedto invest in repurchase agreements. The Adviser serves as investment adviserto each of the Funds.2. Each of the Funds has or may be expected to have from time to time uninvestedcash balances in its custodial bank, State Street Bank and Trust Company(``State Street''), which would not otherwise be invested in portfoliosecurities by the Adviser at the end of each trading day. In the normalcourse of business, if the amount of such assets of each Fund is separatelyof sufficient size, the Adviser attempts to invest the assets of such Fundin federal securities, overnight repurchase agreements with a bank or majorbrokerage house, or primary U.S. government securities dealer, or othershort-term investments authorized by the Fund's investment policies, inorder to earn additional income for that Fund.3. Generally, there can remain in the respective account of each Fund,some amount of its assets which is received too late or is too small tobe effectively invested in a separate transaction and/or at a rate reflectingthe cost and investment risk of the transaction. At present, each Fundmust separately pursue, secure and implement its repurchase agreement investments.The Funds pay approximately $12.00 per transaction to State Street forprocessing each repurchase agreement. This fee is a processing fee onlyand is not related to the size of the transaction. During the twelve monthsended December 31, 1987, the average daily amounts invested by all theFunds in repurchase agreements was $16,142,768 and the fees amounted toapproximately $87,360 for the Funds.4. Applicants propose to establish with the Funds' custodial bank a singlejoint account (``Account'') into which each Fund will automatically transferits uninvested cash balances remaining after the conclusion of daily trading,and will be used to enter into one or more large repurchase agreementsin a total amount equal to the aggregate daily balance in the Account.5. Applicants represent that the Account will operate subject to the followingprocedures:(a) A separate custodial cash account will be established at State Streetinto which each Fund will cause its uninvested net cash balances to bedeposited daily.(b) Cash in the Account will be invested solely in repurchase agreementscollateralized by suitable U.S. Government obligations (i.e., obligationsissued or guaranteed as to principal and interest by the U.S. Governmentor by any of its agencies or instrumentalities), and satisfying the uniformstandards set by any of the Funds for such investments.(c) All investments held by the Account will be valued on an amortizedcost basis.(d) Each Fund subject to an exemptive order permitting valuation of itssecurities on an amortized cost basis or relying upon Rule 2a-7 under the1940 Act will use the average maturity of the Account for the purpose ofcomputing the Fund's average portfolio maturity with respect to the portionof its assets held in such Account on that day.(e) In order to assure that there will be no opportunity for one Fund touse any part of a balance of the Account credited to another Fund, no Fundwill be allowed to create a negative balance in the Account for any reason,although it will be permitted to draw down its entire balance at any time.Each Fund's decision to invest in the Account will be solely at the Fund'soption and no Fund will be obligated to invest in nor to maintain any minimumbalance in the Account. In addition, each Fund will retain the sole rightsof ownership of any of its assets, including interest payable on such assetsinvested in the Account. Each Fund's investment in the Account will bedocumented daily on the books of each Fund as well as on the books of theFund's custodian.(f) Each Fund will participate in the income earned or accrued in the Accountand all instruments (i.e., cash and U.S. Government securities) held inthe Account on the basis of the percentage of the total amount in the Accounton any day represented by its share of the account.(g) The Adviser will administer the investment of the cash balances inand operation of the Account as part of its duties under its existing orany future investment advisory contract with each Fund and will not collectany additional or separate fees for the management of the Account. TheAdviser will collect its fees based upon the assets of each separate Fundas provided in each respective investment advisory agreement.(h) The administration of the Account will be within the fidelity bondcoverage required by section 17(g) of the 1940 Act and Rule 17g-1 thereunder.The Boards of Trustees of the existing Funds and of future Funds participatingin the Account will evaluate the Account arrangements annually, and willcontinue the Account only if they determine that there is a reasonablelikelihood that the Account will benefit the Funds and their shareholders.6. Each of the Funds has established the same systems and standards, includingquality standards for issuers of repurchase agreements and for collateral,and requirements that the repurchase agreements will be at least 100% collateralizedat all times. Such uniform systems and standards will apply to the jointtransactions contemplated herein. Furthermore, such joint transactionswill be effected in accordance with the guidelines set forth in InvestmentCompany Act Release No. 13005 (February 3, 1983) and with whatever positionsmay be taken in the future by the SEC or its staff by rule, release, letteror otherwise relating to such transactions. Finally, any future Funds willbe required to participate in the Account on the same terms and conditionsas the existing Funds have set forth in the Application.7. Each Fund will participate in the Account on the same basis as everyother Fund and in conformity with each Fund's fundamental investment objectives,policies and restrictions. The Adviser will have no monetary participationin the Account, but will be responsible for investing monies in the Account,establishing accounting and control procedures and ensuring the equal treatmentof each Fund. The assets of the Funds will continue to be held under properbank custodial procedures with State Street.8. The Account will not be distinguishable from any other account maintainedby a Fund with State Street except that monies from each Fund could bedoposited with State Street on a commingled basis. The Account would nothave any separate existence which would have indicia of a separate legalentity. The sole function of the Account would be to provide a convenientway of aggregating what otherwise would require daily management by eachFund of its uninvested cash balances.<ITAG tagnum="84">Applicants' Legal Conclusions</ITAG>1. For the reasons set forth herein, the granting of the requested orderis consistent with the provisions, policies and purposes of the 1940 Actand the participation in the Account by each Fund will not be on a basisdifferent from or less advantageous than any other Fund participants andthe participation by the Adviser will be ministerial only so that the criteriafor issuance of an order under section 17(d) of the 1940 Act and Rule 17d-1thereunder are met. In considering the establishment of the Account, theTrustees have sought and received advice from the Funds' legal counsel,as well as the advice of ``outside'' counsel of the ``disinterested'' Trustees,both of which are expected to be retained on a continuing basis. They havealso considered the fact that although the Adviser would gain some benefitthrough administrative convenience and some possible reduction in clericalcosts, the primary beneficiaries would be the Funds and their shareholders.2. Applicants believe that the Account will have the following benefitsfor the Funds: (a) If the Account had been in place for the year endingDecember 31, 1987, and the daily balances invested in a single repurchaseagreement each business day, the estimated aggregate savings in transactioncosts would have been approximately $62,400; (b) the Funds will be ableto negotiate a higher rate of return and eliminate certain inefficiencies;(c) there would be a reduction in the number of trade tickets to be processedand in opportunities for error; and (d) the Funds will have enhanced flexibilityin the management of their uninvested cash balances.3. The Board of Trustees of each of the Funds has considered the Accountand determined that its use would be fair, economically desirable and beneficialto each Fund; would not result in any conflicts of interests between anyof the Funds or between a Fund and the Adviser; would be free of any inherentbias favoring one Fund over another and should elimiante bias due to sizeor lack thereof in any transaction; and that the anticipated benefits flowingto each Fund would fall within an acceptable range of fairness. They havefurther determined that future participation in the Account by one or morefuture Funds would not alter their conclusion with respect to participationby the existing Funds, and that it would be desirable to permit such futureparticipation without the necessity of applying for an amendment to thisrequested order.<ITAG tagnum="84">Applicants' Conditions</ITAG>Applicants agree to operate the Account in accordance with the proceduresset forth in paragraph 5 above and agree that such procedures may be madeexpress conditions of the requested order.<ITAG tagnum="21">For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, underdelegated authority.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan G.
