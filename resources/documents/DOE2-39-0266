<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-39-0266 </DOCNO><TEXT>The massless fermion field in two dimensions is studied on random lattices.By averaging over an ensemble of random lattices, it is shown that thechiral fermion propagators with or without an external abelian gaugefield agree well with the continuum limit. Using the point-splittingdefinition, the composite boson propagators agree roughly with the continuumlimit. The chiral symmetry and revelant anomalies are discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
