News Corp. has been quietly attempting to renegotiate allthe movie supply pacts that its Sky Channel and rival BritishSatellite Broadcasting negotiated before their agreement tomerge last December. In 1988, when the two satellite TVcompanies were hotly competing for subscribers andprogramming, both bid aggressively for movie rights, signingexpensive long-term agreements to buy movies from all themajor studios.</LP><TEXT>   But News Corp. is apparently encountering stiff resistancein its efforts to renegotiate the most expensive of thoseagreements, a five-year pact that British SatelliteBroadcasting struck with United International Pictures. UIPis the European distribution venture of Paramount, a unit ofParamount Communications Inc.; Universal, a unit ofMatsushita Electric Industrial Co.'s MCA Inc., and MGM-PatheCommunications Co. The pact covers about 1,000 films fromParamount and Universal; a pact with MGM was negotiatedseparately.   According to a memo sent to Sky executives, News Corp. hasprepared a complaint that is &quot;ready to be filed&quot; with theEuropean Commission in Brussels &quot;attacking the UIP jointventure&quot; as a violation of Article 85 of the Treaty of Rome,which restricts certain agreements among competitors. Theaim, the memo says, is to get the EC to rule that the UIPventure, by grouping three studios to sell pay-TV rights, is&quot;collusive activity.&quot; The memo also says the company isprepared to file suit in Britain &quot;for damages and adeclaration that the pay television license agreement betweenUIP and BSB is unlawful and void.&quot;   News Corp. declined to comment on the memo. It isn't clearwhether News Corp. will actually take any legal action orwhether the memo is just a negotiating tactic aimed atpressuring Paramount and Universal to come down in price.Because UIP has long operated in Europe as a distributor offilms to theaters for all three studios, it also is unclearwhy it would be restricted from other distributionagreements. One attorney familiar with the Treaty of Romeprovision said it doesn't restrict all joint marketingagreements, and News Corp. might have a difficult time makingits case successfully in either Brussels or the U.K.   News Corp.'s position is that the UIP partner's clearanceto jointly distribute movies to theaters doesn't extend totelevision. The memo said UIP's ability to negotiate onbehalf of three major studios forces licensees &quot;to acceptterms more onerous than would have been the case in singlestudio negotiations.&quot;   A spokesman for Paramount said the company and UIP aren'taware that News Corp. is &quot;going to file anything&quot; at the ECor in the U.K., &quot;and as far as we're concerned, we have avalid contract and expect them to live up to it.&quot; Executivesat both Paramount and MCA acknowledged that talks have beenheld about some relief for the contract, but with noresolution.   News Corp., which took management responsibility for theSky venture after the merger, takes the position that theper-movie prices are far out of line with other pay-TVlicense fees. BSB, which had only 100,000 subscribers, waspaying $800,000 to $1 million for movies. News Corp. arguesthat the combined service, which now has about a millionsubscribers, should be paying closer to $300,000 a movie, orabout 20 to 30 cents a subscriber, in line with U.S. pay-TVlicense fees.   The UIP pact includes at least 150 first-run movies, 500library films and as many as 200 movies made for cable andbroadcast television. Paramount and Universal were to supplyat least 30 new films each year.   News Corp.'s partners in Sky are the consortium of BSBbackers, which includes publishers Reed International PLC andPearson PLC, Granada Group PLC and France's Chargeurs S.A.The two sides had invested a combined $2.43 billion in theventure before merging.</TEXT></DOC>
