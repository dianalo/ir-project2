The United National Democratic Movement of Korea, whichrepresents 200 dissident groups, said Roh must resign immediatelybecause of his March 20 decision to indefinitely postpone areferendum.   ``Since its indefinite postponement of the referendum proves afailure to gain the public's confidence, the Roh Tae-woo regime muststep down immediately,'' alliance chairman Lee Bu-young told a newsconference.   The alliance denounced Roh's decision earlier this week to issuepowerful semi-automatic M-16 rifles to police for self-defenseagainst protesters who attack police stations and governmentbuildings with firebombs and explosives.   Lee charged the decision to distribute 13,000 M-16s to police wasa desperate attempt by the government to cling to power. He saidanti-government forces would not abandon their drive to oust Roh.   ``The arming of the police with M-16s is an open threat to thepeople. The decision must be rescinded immediately. The democraticforces would never cease their fight against the dictatorship,'' Leesaid.   About 1,000 radical students hurling firebombs and rocks battledriot police in separate clashes at Sunkyunkwan and Hong-iluniversities in Seoul to protest the decision to issue M-16s.Students hurled hundreds of firebombs at riot police, who fired teargas at protesters.   ``Down with Roh Tae-woo, who issued shooting orders,'' studentschanted. ``Down with Roh Tae-woo, who deceived the people.''   About 500 students armed with firebombs and rocks clashed withpolice at Dankuk University near Teajon in central South Korea,according to Yonhap, the national news agency. Police officials hadno reports of arrests or serious injuries in either city.   It was the second straight day of violent campus protests againstthe M-16 decision.
