Big politics, big applause, and big headaches for whoever is elected.    In a campaign where voters are looking for change and anxious about the country falling behind competing nations, science holds out hope that the U.S. will prevail. Michael Dukakis drapes himself in the memories of the Kennedy space program and preaches a better life through chemistry for everything from corn products to oil exploration. Campaigning here in a tobacco state, Mr. Dukakis, a rigid anti-smoker, says scientists promise &quot;medicinal&quot; uses for the crop -- helping the tobacco market as well as his prospects in Southern border states.    George Bush goes him one better in space. On a campaign swing through Alabama, he suggests to National Aeronautics and Space Administration workers at the space flight center in Huntsville that he might approve a manned mission to Mars, which could cost a whopping $300 billion. The vice president's science advisers can't name a single big science project Mr. Bush opposes.    This euphoria means new budget commitments and even more dogfights over how to pare the deficit. Already, scientists fret that the next administration won't be able to pay for the big science projects now under way, including a $30 billion space station, a $50 billion strategic defense initiative and a $3 billion plan to map human genes. New programs will make the budget battles even bloodier.    &quot;Looking 20 years from now, the most important question facing the next president is how to deal with science,&quot; says Rep. David Obey, a Wisconsin Democrat and influential Appropriations Committee member.    The Reagan administration changed the pattern of 15 years of federal research-and-development spending by slowing to a crawl the growth of civilian research programs, such as energy development, while pumping up defense. From 1965 through 1980, the federal government spent roughly the same amounts on the two areas. But in the current fiscal year, defense research spending, at about $40 billion, will be twice the level of civilian spending.    Mr. Dukakis says he will reverse the Reagan course, slashing research funds for Star Wars and a $3 billion Air Force air-breathing jet and putting the money into civilian research. There is &quot;nothing more important than what Randamp;D policy you have,&quot; the Democratic presidential nominee says in an interview. And in campaign swings in California's Silicon Valley and in New Jersey, he hammers home the theme that the U.S. should follow the example of Japan in using its scientific know-how to produce high-quality consumer and industrial products.    Mr. Bush, however, faces a problem. As the No. 2 official in the Reagan administration, he boosts all its science projects despite their high prices. But to make his mark as the Republican presidential candidate, he pushes new programs too, even if they will worsen the budget deficit. For instance, he advocates making the research-and-development tax credit permanent, which could cost $800 million a year. And he backs an ambitious program to study the Earth from space, at a cost of about $500 million a year.    Bud Evans, an Arlington, Va., space consultant who advises the Bush campaign, says it is looking for a way out of the budget bind by attracting private and international funds to space exploration. Another Bush aide says the campaign is studying a &quot;space trust fund&quot; that would levy fees on aerospace contractors. But the aide, who wants to scuttle the proposal, says it's impractical because &quot;it doesn't make any sense for contractors to put money in {the trust} so they can take money out. &quot;   Detailed discussions of science policy get lost in the bustle of a presidential campaign. Democratic pollster Harrison Hickman says that voters respond instead to specific projects, such as research on AIDS or ozone depletion, which they believe affects them directly. &quot;I guess you'd call it sexy science,&quot; he says. &quot;It tends to be project-specific.&quot;    But campaign decisions have very real effects on science policy. Early in the campaign, Mr. Dukakis signaled that he might kill the space station in favor of a cheaper alternative. But now the Democratic candidate seems to be easing off that stand by recruiting space buffs as advisers and saying he will give vice presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen a major role in deciding space policy. In 1986 the Texas senator gave up a senior committee assignment to take a junior spot on the subcommittee that oversees NASA, largely to win more space station jobs for the Johnson Space Center in Houston.    And Mr. Bentsen's nomination may also give Texas a leg up on competition among states for a $5 billion atom smasher. Now, no matter who wins the election, a Texan will be in the White House.    But neither candidate has come to terms with the central problem of setting science policy: Power is so diffuse that no single individual or agency effectively oversees the government's $60 billion a year research-and-development effort. Vast science projects get sold or rejected based on the adroitness of bureaucrats at finding champions in the White House or Capitol Hill.    &quot;We have engendered a new definition of political science,&quot; says Rep. Don Ritter, (R., Pa.) a former engineering-school professor. &quot;Most (big) science is the outgrowth of raw politics.&quot;    Consider the human genome project, for instance. This $3 billion project to investigate the chemical makeup of human genes and pinpoint where they reside in the cell originated with an Energy Department scientist probing the effects of radiation. But the National Institutes of Health quickly latched onto the project, citing its expertise in medical technology.    NIH then increased its clout by convincing Nobel Prize laureate James Watson, a genetics pioneer, to lobby for money; now it is wooing him to oversee NIH's genome work. As a result, NIH is the favorite to lead the genome project, if the government rules out a multi-agency approach.    Mr. Dukakis says he will boost White House control over science policy by appointing a strong science adviser who will report regularly and directly to the president. He cites as a model the close, personal relationship President Kennedy had with his science adviser, Jerome Weisner. But even then, the science adviser's role was circumscribed. Mr. Weisner recommended against manned space flight. But Mr. Kennedy decided that Americans should explore the moon anyway. </TEXT></DOC>
