Maxwell raised his offer for the U.S. publishing giant to $2.41billion cash on Thursday, in a surprise move to counter a $2.36billion buyout deal that Macmillan accepted earlier this week fromthe investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co.   Maxwell, who previously had offered $84 for each of thecompany's 27.76 million shares, said he now was willing to pay$86.80 a share. He also offered to pay the company's recentlydeclared 20-cent per share quarterly dividend.   Alternatively, Maxwell his Sept. 8 offer to purchase 11Macmillan information businesses for $1.4 billion still was good.   Maxwell's late afternoon announcement surprised many Wall Streettraders, many of whom previously had assumed he probably would backaway from Macmillan in light of its Kohlberg Kravis agreement.   Traders scrambled to buy Macmillan shares in anticipation of abidding war, pushing the stock up $2 a share to $86.50 in New YorkStock Exchange composite trading.   ``I kind of thought it might be over but this really re-ignitesthe whole situation,'' said Bert Boksen, a strategist who followsMacmillan for Raymond James andamp; Associates Inc., an investment firmin St. Petersburg, Fla. ``I'm quite sure Macmillan doesn't want tosell to Maxwell.''   David Jackson, Macmillan's vice president for investorrelations, said the company had no comment on the new Maxwelloffer. Kohlberg also said through its public relations firm, Kekstandamp; Co., that it had no comment.   On the surface, Maxwell's offer is more attractive toshareholders. The tender offer announced Monday by Macmillanmanagement and Kohlberg, would pay shareholders $80 in cash and $5in securities and likely would involve selling chunks of the NewYork-based company.   Some analysts speculated Macmillan management and KohlbergKravis would be hard pressed to top Maxwell's latest bid. Butothers said Macmillan managers remain fiercely opposed to sellingthe company to Maxwell, whom they regard as an unpredictable andcapricious businessman who knows little about the U.S. publishingbusiness.   Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc., another big American publishingconcern, successfully thwarted a Maxwell-led takeover last year byloading itself up with billions of dollars in new debt that forcedit to sell a number of business.   ``Maxwell is considered a real maverick in this industry, adifficult person to work for or with, and somebody that might parethe company up,'' Boksen said. ``He's not the type of person yourmore traditional publishing companies want to associate with.''   Some speculated Macmillan would find a way to raise the offer orperhaps find a third ``white knight'' friendly acquirer for thecompany.   The Kohlberg deal was structured as a leveraged buyout, in whichthe purchase money is borrowed and repaid with the acquiredcompany's cash flow, earnings or asset sales. It was consideredlikely that Macmillan would have to sell part of its operations tofinance such a deal.   Macmillan is a leading publisher of educational textbooks. Italso owns a range of other information businesses that range fromtelemarketing services to the Berlitz language training schoolchain.</TEXT></DOC>
