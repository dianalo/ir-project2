Sales rose 11% to $5.82 billion from $5.22billion.   Deere said the quarter and year-to-date improvements areattributable to increased sales, higher production andimproved operating efficiency in its North American farmequipment operations.   The company said that despite the strong sales of itsagricultural equipment, declining consumer spending fordurable goods is resulting in lower retail sales of its lawnand grounds care products.   &quot;This pattern will likely continue during the remainder ofthis year and into early 1991,&quot; Deere said. The company addedthat it now expects retail sales of lawn and grounds careproducts to be &quot;significantly lower&quot; in the fourth quarter.   Looking ahead, Deere said it is now &quot;less certain&quot; becauseof the effects of a weaker economy on consumer confidence andspending and construction activity.</TEXT></DOC>
