The meeting, the first multilateral gathering of its kind, comes after an unusually active period of cooperation that has followed years of disagreements among the international regulators. Topics under discussion, according to one British regulator, will include several bilateral pacts already proposed to add to current information-sharing arrangements.    Under one such arrangement, British authorities recently received information from the U.S. about the Ivan Boesky insider-trading case. Bahamian and Swiss cooperation, meanwhile, helped the Securities and Exchange Commission track down Mr. Boesky by identifying an investment banker who was trading with him.    In addition to Britain, the U.S. has information-sharing arrangements with Japan, Switzerland, Italy and the Netherlands. Britain is currently negotiating a pact with Japan, which would provide the last regulatory link among the world's three main financial centers.    A spokesman for Britain's Department of Trade and Industry said the regulators also will discuss investigative cooperation, the effects on each authority of international trading links, and more cooperation with bank regulators. Countries expected to attend the meeting include Australia, Britain, Canada, France, Hong Kong, Japan, the Netherlands, Switzerland, West Germany and the U.S. </TEXT></DOC>
