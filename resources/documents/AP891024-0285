George Kourpias, president of the International Association ofMachinists and Aerospace Workers, also was to meet with local unionleaders as the strike against the aerospace giant continued with nonegotiations scheduled.   Kourpias on Monday addressed a gathering of Boeing strikers inWichita, Kan., but no rally was planned in Seattle. Kourpiasinstead planned to visit pickets at all of Boeing's majorinstallations in the Seattle area.   ``We had our rally last weekend,'' said Tom Baker, president ofMachinists District Lodge 751. About 5,000 people attended a strikemarch and rally Saturday featuring a speech by the Rev. JesseJackson.   The visit came two days before the first strike payments, a flat$100 a week per striker from a $100 million Machinists strike fund,and a day after Boeing chairman Frank Shrontz reiterated thecompany's hard-line stance.   Meanwhile, Boeing spokesman Deane Darling said two 737-300s weredelivered Tuesday to Lufthansa Airlines, bringing total deliveriesduring the strike to 18 _ all planes that were virtually completebefore the walkout.   In addition, Trans European Airways, a Belgian charter firm,ordered 12 jets, a mixture of 737-300 and -400 models, saidspokesman John Wheeler.   Firm orders received during the strike now total 68 aircraftworth $4.3 billion, boosting total orders for 1989 to 804 planesworth $42.8 billion. Boeing's firm-order backlog is now 1,653planes worth about $82 billion, with deliveries stretching into thelate 1990s, Darling said.   Shrontz said Monday that Boeing would not increase its totalmoney offer because any boost would jeopardize the company'scompetitive position.   The union represents 57,800 Boeing production workersnationwide, including 43,300 around Seattle, 12,000 in Wichita,1,700 in Portland, Ore., and several hundred at sites inCalifornia, Hawaii, Utah, Montana, Wyoming and other states.   A three-year offer that was rejected in an 85 percent strikevote Oct. 3 included pay increases of 4 percent, 3 percent and 3percent; bonuses of 8 percent of gross pay in the first year and 3percent in the second; cost-of-living increases to cover inflation;a 20 percent reduction in mandatory overtime; and higher benefits.   The production-halting strike against the world's largestcommercial airplane builder began Oct. 4. The only talks since thencollapsed after less than four hours last week with no furthermeetings scheduled.   Meanwhile, contract talks with Boeing's second-largest union,the Seattle Professional Engineering Employees Association resumedTuesday.   Preliminary talks covering 28,000 engineers and technicalworkers, about 95 percent in the Seattle area, began Oct. 16 butbroke off later that day with Boeing negotiators complaining ofexcessive pay demands.   Leaders of the association are seeking a three-year pact withpay raises of 14 percent in the first six months, 5 percent thesecond and 4 percent every half-year thereafter for engineers. Fortechnical workers, the association is seeking 14 percent the firstyear and 2 percent every six months thereafter.   The association's contracts expires Dec. 1. Both sides have saida strike is unlikely.</TEXT></DOC>
