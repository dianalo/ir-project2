But for long-term investors who don't trade often -- which includes most individuals -- that may be unnecessarily expensive. Recent studies of the performance of listed stocks show that, on average, less-liquid issues generate substantially higher returns -- as much as several percentage points a year at the extremes.    &quot;Liquidity is a valuable item that must be, and is, paid for even if it's not used,&quot; says Steven Wunch, a vice president at Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. In terms of investment strategy, he adds, &quot;It only makes sense that if you don't need it or use it, don't pay for it.&quot;    Just being illiquid doesn't make a stock a good investment, especially in the over-the-counter market, where the risk of getting torpedoed by thinly traded issues can be high. But among stocks listed on the major exchanges, illiquidity can be viewed as a positive, not a negative, factor in portfolio selection.    Among the academic studies that have attempted to quantify this illiquidity payoff is a recent work by two finance professors, Yakov Amihud of New York University and Tel Aviv University, and Haim Mendelson of the University of Rochester. Their study looks at New York Stock Exchange issues over the 1961-1980 period and defines liquidity in terms of bid-asked spreads as a percentage of overall share price.    Market makers use spreads in quoting stocks to define the difference between the price they'll bid to take stock off an investor's hands and the price they'll offer to sell stock to any willing buyer. The bid price is always somewhat lower because of the risk to the broker of tying up precious capital to hold stock in inventory until it can be resold.    If a stock is relatively illiquid, which means there's not a ready flow of orders from customers clamoring to buy it, there's more of a chance the broker will lose money on the trade. To hedge this risk, market makers demand an even bigger discount to service potential sellers, and the spread will widen further.    The study by Profs. Amihud and Mendelson shows that liquidity spreads -- measured as a percentage discount from the stock's total price -- ranged from less than 0.1%, for widely held International Business Machines Corp., to as much as 4% to 5%. The widest-spread group was dominated by smaller, low-priced stocks. In recent years, the group has tended to be biased toward companies working their way through bankruptcy and overlooked, low-growth stocks that were later acquired by larger companies for their good asset values.    The study found that, overall, the least-liquid stocks averaged an 8.5%-a-year higher return than the most-liquid stocks over the 20-year period. On average, a one percentage point increase in the spread was associated with a 2.5% higher annual return for New York Stock Exchange stocks. The relationship held after results were adjusted for size and other risk factors.    An extension of the study of Big Board stocks done at The Wall Street Journal's request, produced similar findings. It showed that for the 1980-85 period, a one percentage-point-wider spread was associated with an extra average annual gain of 2.4%. Meanwhile, the least-liquid stocks outperformed the most-liquid stocks by almost six percentage points a year.    Since the cost of the spread is incurred each time the stock is traded, illiquid stocks can quickly become prohibitively expensive for investors who trade frequently. This is especially true of large institutions whose own buying and selling may have a big, immediate impact on the price at which they can execute their trades. On the other hand, small, long-term investors needn't worry so much about spreads, since they can amortize them over a longer period.    In terms of investment strategy, this suggests &quot;that the small investor should tailor the types of stocks he or she buys to his expected holding period,&quot; Prof. Mendelson says. If the investor expects to sell within three months, he says, it's better to pay up for liquidity and get the lowest spread. If the investor plans to hold the stock for a year or more, it makes sense to aim at stocks with spreads of 3% or more to capture the extra return. </TEXT></DOC>
