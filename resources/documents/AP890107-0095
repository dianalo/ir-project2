None of the indictments issued in U.S. District Court on Fridayinvolves high-ranking present or former military officials, but U.S.Attorney Henry Hudson said the continuing inquiry promises to be aprotracted affair.   One defense contractor, a Navy employee and five other men wereindicted on charges that included conspiracy and bribery, whileanother corporation pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud thegovernment.   ``I think over the next few months, perhaps the next year, you'llsee a great deal of additional activity,'' Hudson said Friday,adding that the initial round of indictments represented a ``smallpercentage'' of the case.   ``It's a significant investigation and my assessment of itsdimensions hasn't changed in the last six or seven months,'' hesaid. Prosecutors have subpoenaed more than 1 million documents andspent ``many, many hours'' before the grand jury, he said.   The big-rigging investigation hinges on allegations that privateconsultants, hired by defense contracting firms, paid bribes togovernment employees for inside information that gave them anadvantage in securing multimillion-dollar contracts.   Hudson, who had once promised indictments in late fall, said heis satisfied with the pace of the complex case.   ``I think if you'll compare this to others of its type ... thisinvestigation is almost unprecedently quick,'' he said.   Six months ago, President Reagan, declaring he was ``very upset''about the reports of corruption in the Pentagon's$150-billion-a-year purchasing system, told law enforcement agentsto move ``as rapidly as possible'' to get the facts on the case,said his spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater.   And President-elect Bush said the allegations, if correct, showedpeople ``stealing from our national defense and undermining ournational security.''   Although the investigation had been under way since September1986, it was not made public until mid-June when the FBI issuedsearch warrants at 38 locations and 12 states. Investigators usedcourt-ordered wiretaps to gather much of their information.   At least 20 defense contractors are under investigation, as wellas six Pentagon officials and a number of consultants, among themMelvyn Paisley, former assistant secretary of the Navy for research,engineering and systems.   Hudson has said no congressmen were targets of the investigation,although Rep. Roy Dyson, D-Md., and former Rep. William Chappell,D-Fla., were once described as being under scrutiny. No searchwarrants or subpoenas were issued to members of Congress or theirstaffs.   Shortly after the investigation was revealed, Defense SecretaryFrank Carlucci reassigned the six Pentagon officials under scrutiny.Then, based on information he received from court papers, hesuspended payment on $1 billion worth of potentially taintedmilitary contracts.   The investigation has prompted calls in Congress to overhaul andprocurement system at the Pentagon, which lets contracts worth $620million daily.   The first indictment named Teledyne Electronics of Newbury Park,Calif., a division of Teledyne Industries, three of its employees,two private consultants and a Navy procurement specialist. They willbe arraigned Friday in U.S. District Court. Teledyne could be finedup to $6.5 million if convicted.   At the heart of the indictment are charges that Teledyne and itsofficers agreed to pay consultant William Parkin $160,000 to assistthem in obtaining a Navy contract worth $100 million.   Parkin paid Fred Lackner, a California-based private consultant,who gave money to Stuart E. Berlin, a Navy procurement official, forhis assistance in manipulating the procurement process, theindictment says.   If convicted of all charges, Berlin, Parkin and Lackner couldface maximum penalties of 185 years in prison and fines of $5.5million each, Hudson said.   At the same time, Hazeltine Corp., of Greenlawn, N.Y., a divisionof Emerson Electric Co., pleaded guilty among other things toconspiracy to defraud the government in its efforts to obtain acontract for radar testing devices.   Hazeltine, which is cooperating with the government, agreed topay fines and court costs of just under $2 million, a fee Hudsonsaid he believed was ``appropriate.''   Two former Hazeltine employees and a Teledyne Electonics employeealso pleaded guilty to lesser charges. They, too, are cooperatingwith the government.   The Pentagon said it is reviewing the guilty pleas and theindictments to see what action should be taken.</TEXT></DOC>
