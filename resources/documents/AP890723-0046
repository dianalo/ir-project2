(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Security troops sent to quell ethnicrioting in Soviet Georgia are facing groups of heavily armedextremists who apparently want to provoke them into firing oncivilians, official reports said Sunday.   The Soviet news agency Tass reported that the commanders ofinternal security troops in Abkhazia, a Black Sea enclave about 880miles south of Moscow, appealed to the local populace to resist``extremists and bandits, not to allow further bloodshed.''   The commanders said they did not blame the populace for theslayings Friday of two security soldiers, whose deaths brought to19 the number of poeple killed in a week of rioting by ethnicGeorgians and Abkhazians.   ``But at the same time, it's possible that there are forces thatare not against creating clashes between the population andsoldiers in order to provoke the troops into using their weapons,which they haven't done once in Abkhazia,'' the appeal said.   In Sukhumi, Abkhazia's capital, public transport resumed afterdays of paralysis from a strike, residents said Sunday in telephoneinterviews.   But activists in Georgia have proposed a general strike Mondayto protest what they see as a failure by police and troops toprotect ethnic Georgians in Abkhazia.   Interior Ministry officers in Abkhazia told Pravda they had``never seen so many weapons in the hands of the population.''   The two police killed Friday were shot with hunting rifles asthey were clearing roadblocks and confiscating weapons in westernGeorgia.   As a result of the continuing violence, two regional partysecretaries were fired and two government leaders in Abkhazia losttheir jobs Saturday.   Abkhazians and Georgians blame each other for the ethnic unrest.   Abkhazians, who are a minority in their own region, want greatereconomic independence and cultural rights, while Georgians want thefertile enclave, with its seaside resorts, retained as part oftheir Caucasus republic.   The Georgian youth newspaper Molodyozh Gruzii said Georgianleaders want to develop a dialogue over problems besetting theregion, but that Abkhazians want the Kremlin to establish anoutside body to take control of the region.   At least 132 people have died in ethnic unrest during the pastmonth in the southern Soviet republics of Georgia, Azerbaijan,Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Tadzhikistan.</TEXT></DOC>
