These additionshave been made possible by large investments into development of fields,transmission and preparation of markets to receive them. But nowherehas the effort reached the magnitude of the U.S.S.R. undertaking. Itis an extraordinary achievement. It is held that every eighteen monthsthe Soviet Union completes a gas investment equivalent to the size ofthe enormous project required to bring Alaskan gas to the U.S. market;the point is that the Alaskan investment was postponed. The Soviet Unioncontinues to place very high priority on the fullest possible use ofits gas reserves for domestic consumption and into international trade,including both Eastern and Western Europe. The authors of this chapterbring the gas effort into perspective both as to the needs and the importanceof the U.S.S.R. as the gas supplier to Eastern Europe, and as a verymajor source for Western Europe. The volumes involved and the price arrangementsaree set forth in lucid expositions. Not enough is yet known of the U.S.S.R.role in natural gas and the following contribution helps significantlyto enlarge upon our understanding of one of the great energy revolutionsof our time.</TEXT></DOC>
