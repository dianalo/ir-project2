Suited up for wet work, he uses a water spray to keep the nuggetcool as he works next to the blue tilt-back chair. &quot;I let the shape of thematerial dictate whether it's free form or floral,&quot; Buschke says of hisdesigns. When he's through, he'll mount the finished carving as a standingsculpture or as a piece of jewelry.;    Jewelry making is a naturalprogression for a dentist, used to shaping materials with precisioninstruments. &quot;I've been a wood carver all my life -- as a kid I was alwayswhittling,&quot; says Buschke, 67. &quot;In the last 10 years I've concentrated more onminerals and gems.&quot;;    In the waiting room of his Newark office, aglass-front case filled with Buschke's jewelry -- and such dental curiositiesas a set of ivory false teeth -- stands near a picture chart that reads &quot;Flosseach day the preferred way.&quot;;    Buschke's display includes amethyst rings,tourmaline and opal pendants set in silver and gold filigree, tiny gold framesfor grandchildren's photos, turquoise bolo tie ornaments, silver-cappedcrystals to hang from a Christmas tree.;    Buschke is president of theMineral andamp; Gem Society of Castro Valley and does his metal work at the shop thesociety maintains in Hayward. He uses the lost wax system to create delicategold and silver settings for jewelry. It is really a dental technique: Carvethe wax, leaving space for the form you want. Then pour in the melted silveror gold.;    Although he sells some of his work, most is for family andfriends. The gem society's facilities are strictly for non-commercial work, heexplains. Buschke and his wife, Shirley, search out turquoise on their tripsto Arizona and New Mexico. &quot;The best finds are in flea markets,&quot; he says.;   He is too fond of the turquoise pieces to sell them, but he often donatesother jewelry to local good causes.
