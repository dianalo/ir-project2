The move follows some tension between Continental and FDIC officials over how best to manage the loans, a source close to the portfolio said. The arrangement for Continental to manage loans owned by the agency was set up during hectic rescue talks in 1984. &quot;It was a bad marriage,&quot; the source said. While the bank managed the loans, FDIC officials were on hand to oversee those efforts, and turf fights sometimes developed, the source added, saying &quot;Who makes the final decision?&quot;    Continental wouldn't comment beyond confirming the transfer of management, and an FDIC official said the agency was &quot;satisfied&quot; with the bank's work.    The move comes as Continental, under its new chairman and chief executive officer, Thomas C. Theobald, has sought to narrow the range of its operations and focus more on its profitable business with big corporations.    The FDIC, through rising numbers of bank failures, has since 1984 had to greatly expand its loan liquidation operations and said taking on the Continental loans won't be a problem. &quot;We've picked up some expertise,&quot; in the past four years, Steven A. Seelig, a liquidation official said. Mr. Seelig said the FDIC would take over the loans Oct. 31.    Over the past year, Continental, as administrator of the loans, staged a mass auction that failed to attract bids high enough to satisfy the FDIC, which wanted at least $299 million for loans and other assets with a face value of about $875 million.    Now, Mr. Seelig said, Continental plans this summer to try to sell all the repossessed land and other property in the portfolio, plus some smaller loans. That would leave the FDIC with the worst of the once $4.5 billion of Continental loans. Many of the 100 to 120 big loans that are left are tangled in litigation or other disputes.    Mr. Seelig said Continental officials came to the FDIC recently and said that after the planned sale of repossesed property, the portfolio would be too small to justify a separate collection operation. &quot;We hardly had a choice,&quot; he said, adding that the 1984 bailout agreement allowed either side to terminate the arrangement.    David O. Nordby, the Continental executive vice president who has overseen the bank's collection arm, wouldn't comment. He earlier had approached the FDIC about buying a large portion of the loans in a leveraged buy-out acquisition. The proposal was rejected because the agency felt it was a conflict of interest for Mr. Nordby to bid on the loans at the same time he was making &quot;sell, no-sell decisions&quot; on other investors' bids, the source close to the portfolio said.    Mr. Seelig confirmed that he thought Mr. Nordby's proposal amounted to a conflict of interest.    A Continental spokesman, asked about Mr. Nordby's future role at the bank, said, &quot;I'm not sure yet.&quot; He said executives whose operations are disposed of are typically offered other jobs at the bank, or so-called outplacement services, whichever they choose. </TEXT></DOC>
