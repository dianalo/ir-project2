Grace andamp; Co. said negotiations have been terminated for the sale of its 82% stake in Taco Villa Inc. to the restaurant chain's management.    Grace, New York, said Taco Villa's flat 1988 sales have resulted in difficulties in arranging $55 million in financing for the transaction.    Taco Villa's board of directors also declared a $1-a-share special dividend payable Nov. 8 to holders of record Oct. 11. The special dividend reflects the improved cash position primarily because of the sale in March of the Applebee's restaurant business. That sale resulted in a gain of $6.5 million, or 76 cents a share.    Taco Villa, Dallas, operates and franchises 172 Del Taco and Taco Villa fast-food restaurants. Grace is an international specialty chemicals company with interests in energy, manufacturing and service businesses.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Taco Villa closed at $5.375 a share, down 25 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
