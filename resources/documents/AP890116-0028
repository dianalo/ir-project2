To avoid that, we must rely onour sweat and sacrifice.''   Union leaders immediately threatened to call for a nationwidegeneral strike to protest the measures, which eliminate a systemthat ties wage increases to inflation.   The new program is the fourth major package of economic measuresimposed by Sarney, who took office in March of 1985, ending 21 yearsof repressive, right-wing military rule.   Sarney, in his nationwide radio and television address, referredto it as ``a program of national salvation'' and called on Brazil's154 million people to fight a ``total war against inflation usingthe toughest weapons and most profound measures Brazil has evertaken.''   He said banks would be closed today and Tuesday to give them timeto adapt to the new measures, which include a 17 percent devaluationof the Cruzado and creation of the so-called ``new cruzado'' worth1,000 old ones.   The program also scraps the automatic monthly indexing ofcontracts, savings accounts and most financial transactions to costof living increases.   Among the measures designed to slash the massive public spendingdeficit were firing about 60,000 civil servants, the elimination offive Cabinet ministries and the closing of 42 state companies andagencies.   The package also includes a 45-day price freeze on about 200basic commodities.   Sarney said it also aims to spur the economy and reduce a budgetdeficit that now runs at 6 percent of the gross national product.Last year, the GNP grew just 0.04 percent, while industrial growthfell 2.23 percent from 1987, government figures show.   Union leaders immediately criticized the plan.   ``We weren't consulted about the measures, which will once morecut into workers' salaries,'' said Luiz Mederos, leader of the SaoPaulo metal workers' union. ``I have no doubts angry workers willreact negatively and they will have our support in organizing anationwide strike.''   Union figures show that in the past two years, workers'purchasing power has dipped by about 40 percent due to inflation.   Brazil's past measures, though initially successful, have beenunable to contain inflation.   Brazil's inflation rate hit an all-time-high annual rate of 933percent in 1988, substantially higher than 366 percent during theprevious year.   Inflation in December rose to 28.8 percent, well above the25-percent limit set by business, social and government leaders in a``social pact'' announced in November.   Brazil is the Third World's leading debtor nation, owing $115billion.</TEXT></DOC>
