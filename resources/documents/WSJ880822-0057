However, under the amended version of the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law, the CBO's numbers don't count. Only the numbers prepared by the White House Office of Management and Budget matter, and those numbers suggest a narrow escape from the Gramm-Rudman cuts. Therefore, James Blum, acting CBO director said, &quot;I am confident that there will be no triggering of sequestration&quot; -- or automatic spending cuts -- &quot;next month.&quot;    The CBO figures that the deficit for the year beginning Oct. 1, under Gramm-Rudman accounting rules, will be $153 billion. The White House won't release a comparable figure until Thursday, but data disclosed last month suggest that its estimate will be about $144 billion. Automatic spending cuts will be triggered only if the White House projection exceeds $146 billion.    The difference between the congressional and administration projections primarily reflects the administration's rosier economic outlook. The CBO has upgraded its forecast, but it is still more pessimistic than the White House.    The new CBO forecast sees 2.6% growth in the economy, after inflation, from the fourth quarter of 1988 to the like period of 1989 and 2.7% growth the following year. The administration forecast is 3% and 3.3% for the same periods.    The CBO forecasts a 4.4% increase in consumer prices between the fourth quarters of 1988 and 1989 and a 5% increase the following year. The administration expects 4.2% and 3.9% inflation in the same periods. The CBO also foresees higher interest rates than the administration does.    Mr. Blum also said the congressional agency expects a slowing economy in the second half of 1988 because of higher interest rates, slower growth in exports and a cooling of business investment spending &quot;from the rather feverish pace we saw early this year.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
