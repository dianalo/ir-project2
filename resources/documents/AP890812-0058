The bomb caused no injuries, and the annual Apprentice Boys'Parade marking the end of a Catholic siege of the city 300 yearsago began on schedule.   Marching bands featuring piping flutes and humming accordionsalternated with men carrying banners commemorating the siege.   ``The way we look at it we're more besieged than ever before,''said Robert Kerr, a Protestant farmer from Dungannon district, ashe watched the marchers. The bomb ``means we have no security. Forthe amount of money they're spending, we should get bettersecurity.''   Sectarian violence at the parade 20 years ago led to thedeployment of British troops in the province two days later, andheralded the start of the sectarian and political warfare that hastorn the province since then.   Supporters of the Irish Republican Army fighting the troops plana march Sunday in Belfast to mark the anniversary and theintroduction of an unpopular British policy of internment, sinceended but not forgotten.   Security forces were on full alert throughout the province andextra police and soldiers were stationed in Londonderry.   Police said the bomb exploded shortly after 9 a.m. in a ButcherStreet bar which was ``extensively damaged.'' It had beendiscovered by security forces who evacuated the area, but itexploded before army experts could defuse it, said a spokesman whorefused to be named.   The bar, which was closed, was near the parade route on thefringes of a Catholic area where extra police were to be deployed,he said. ``It's close to an area where there might be opposition tothe parade,'' he said.   Later, the outlawed mainly Roman Catholic IRA claimedresponsibility for the bomb, saying it was timed to go off whilesecurity forces were in the area.   An estimated 15,000 Protestants were expected to turn out forthe parade marking the relief of the city in August 1689 from thebesieging army of Catholic King James II. It is named after the 13apprentice boys who shut the city gates against James' army at thestart of the 105-day siege.   On Sunday, the Belfast parade will mark the 18th anniversary ofthe now-abandoned policy of internment without trial for terroristsuspects introduced Aug. 9, 1971, as well as the arrival of Britishtroops.   Almost 2,000 people were held for varying lengths of timewithout trial before Britain abandoned internment in December 1975following worldwide condemnation.   IRA supporters, who were the main targets of internment,continue to mark the anniversary of its introduction each year withbonfire-lit demonstrations and sporadic rioting sometimes lastingseveral days.   Tension has been heightened by the death of a 15-year-oldCatholic, Seamus Duffy. British news reports said he died Wednesdaywhen he was hit by a plastic bullet fired by police after they wereattacked during anti-internment rioting in Belfast. But his friendsand family deny he was involved in rioting.   About 1,000 mourners attended the boy's funeral in Belfast onFriday, which passed peacefully but caused rioting Friday night byCatholic youths in the north Belfast area where he lived.   Cars were set on fire and two youths were injured when policefired plastic bullets to control the trouble, reported the Britishnew agency, Press Association.   British troops in the province currently number more than10,000, compared a peak of 22,000 at the height of the violence in1972.   They are backed by 6,500 members of the Ulster Defense Regiment,a locally recruited unit of the British Army.</TEXT></DOC>
