(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Handling motion videoandM;Image compression technology, a critical piece of the future of interactivemultimedia, is getting to be the most confusing part of the puzzle.andM;We stay in close touch with most of the major vendors, but we're stillsurprised -- more often than we'd prefer, in fact.andM;This month's surprise came from Radius, which called us in for a briefing onnew products and showed us some really fast JPEG image compression anddecompression.andP;  The surprise was that it was done entirely with software.andO;Andy Singer, Radius' technical guru, explains that the company was going todo a hardware solution, but figured they should make sure that softwarecouldn't do the job as well.andP;  It turns out that software is virtually asfast, at least on Macintosh IIci.andM;JPEG, the Joint Photographic Experts Group, is the international standardsbody that's nearly done with creation of a single-frame image compressionstandard.andP;  This standard, which should be completed at the committee levelshortly, is subject to international review for 12 months, but chips arealready hitting the market.andM;A few months ago, we wrote that C-Cube Microsystems had knocked our socks offwith their JPEG acceleration chip.andP;  Now it doesn't seem quite so impressive-- for still image applications on personal computers.andP;  There are a number ofother applications that are still open for hardware chips, within &quot;dumb&quot;devices such as color scanners, film recorders, still video cameras and such.andM;There's also no way for a personal computer to be able to handle the datathroughput of large-screen color motion video even with compression.andP;  FastJPEG chips, such as C-Cube's, will be useful to address those needs, butthey're small markets.andP;  Those opportunities are severely limited by thebandwidth and storage needed for JPEG compression.andP;  Motion video with JPEGwill only be practical on large magnetic disks and high-performance opticaldiscs, but certainly not on CD-ROM, the multimedia distribution medium ofchoice.andM;We were quite distressed at a recent trade show when one of the better-knownindustry analysts proclaimed that JPEG compression chips had made Intel's DVIobsolete.andP;  When the industry experts are that confused, there's a seriousmisinformation problem.andM;JPEG is a much lower level of compression than DVI offers or MPEG proposes.andO;As a result, JPEG-compressed motion video takes far more storage space andrequires far more bandwidth than CD-ROM can deliver.andP;  JPEG's advantage isthat the lower compression means that the image quality is better.andM;JPEG motion video will be practical in professional video production andother applications where the price of huge disk drives can be justified.andP;  Itwon't be useful for distribution of motion video until there's a majorreduction in the cost of high-performance, high capacity storage media.andP;  Forexample, to distribute a high-quality, full-screen 2-hour movie with JPEGcompression, you'd need a removable medium with a capacity of about 3.5gigabytes, or about six times that of CD-ROMs.andP;  You'd also need to be able toread data from the disk at hard disk speeds.andP;  Now figure out how to makethose disks for about $2 each -- maybe even $5 or $10 -- and you might be inbusiness, assuming you also can build drives for a few hundred dollars.andP;  Andif you want people to use this new medium creatively, make that new diskrewriteable.andM;In other words, a few years of Randamp;D remain.andM;Meanwhile, Intel is shipping DVI development systems (over 300 last weheard), MPEG is doing its work and a few others claim to have highcompression systems that will also compete, such as UVC Corp. and IteratedSystems.andM;MPEG's September meeting in Santa Clara led to the definition of a finalalgorithm for video encoding.andP;  However, there's plenty of work left.andO;Predicting the progress of an international standards body is dangerous, butwe doubt that we'll start to see MPEG chips any earlier than late next yearor early 1992.andP;  That would put MPEG about where JPEG is today -- if nothingdelays the process.andM;The coming chip warsandM;At the component level, we suspect there are at least a dozen companiesworking on various kinds of compression chips.andP;  International standards havethat effect.andP;  Standards can trigger rapid market development and givespecific direction to the chip companies, reducing the risk of creating chipsthat fall out of favor.andM;The latest announcement, but certainly not the last, came from LSI Logic, aleading manufacturer of application-specific integrated circuits.andP;  LSI latelast month announced a chip set for JPEG and teleconferencing (H.261, alsoknown as Px64).andP;  The LSI chips are somewhere between the hard wiredinflexibility of C-Cube's JPEG chip and the extreme flexibility of Intel'sprogrammable DVI chips.andM;All of the Randamp;D on compression chips is good news for everyone except theshort-term interests of the chip makers.andP;  There are so many chips on the waythat competition will be bloody for a while.andP;  We figure that as early as theend of next year JPEG chip makers will be struggling for margins.andP;  Thereprobably won't be any problem selling chips, but prices can be expected tofall quickly.andM;Video compression will generate a lot of revenue for chip companies.andP;  Seriousprofits will belong to the survivors.andP;  Getting manufacturing costs down asquickly as possible will be the key.andP;  Reducing costs in chip manufacturingcomes mainly from practice -- getting down the &quot;learning curve&quot; as fast aspossible, by manufacturing in the highest volumes possible, which comes fromhigh sales, which are tied closely to price.andM;The same kind of market dynamics can be expected to happen when MPEG reachesthe same point a year or two later.andP;  JPEG chips will have a bigger problembecause it's increasingly clear that for single-frame applications, such ascolor desktop publishing and presentations, software-only solutions, such asthe Radius program, will suffice for many computer users.andM;The bulk of the remaining customers are even more price-sensitive thancomputer users.andP;  In talking to manufacturers of color printer, scanners, filmrecorders and other computer peripherals, we hear over and over that there'sno way they're going to incorporate $200 compression chips in their products.andO;The prices will have to come down and they will, given all of the competitionthat will come on line in the next year.andM;Looking beyond the computer industry, JPEG chips also will find their wayinto electronic still video cameras and similar devices.andP;  But those are evenmore price-sensitive than computer peripherals.andP;  There's no way a $200 chipwill find its way into a camera with a $500 retail price.andM;MPEG chips won't face direct competition from standard microprocessors (wethink).andP;  These are dangerous predictions, and again, there is likely to be alot of competition as chip companies hungrily focus on a huge potentialmarket.andM;Intel's DVI deserves more respectandM;We think that the people who trash or ignore Intel's DVI technology arefoolish.andP;  The reason is simple: no one else has anything better.andP;  You'd thinkthat some other company was shipping a CD-ROM-based motion video system, theway that a lot of analysts and reporters scoff at DVI.andP;  If so, we'd like tosee it.andP;  In this industry, being first counts for a lot.andP;  Products withintegrated DVI are starting to appear.andM;Part of our belief that DVI shouldn't be discounted is based on Intel's trackrecord.andP;  This is the company that's been delivering faster, better, morecomplex microprocessors for years.andP;  When Intel sets forth a schedule ofdelivery of ever more powerful DVI processors, we believe that they'llproduce them.andP;  The schedule will probably slip -- they always do -- butIntel's record strongly suggests that it can accomplish its goals inmicroprocessors.andM;Listening to the pundits would also lead one to think that Intel is going tobe overtaken by MPEG.andP;  The first thing to note is that Al Simon of the DVIoperation is the chairman of the MPEG system committee! The critics also saythat Intel's current and next-generation chips won't have the horsepower tohandle MPEG.andP;  That's quite true and it's also true that the programmable DVIchips trade computing power for flexibility.andP;  But no one has MPEG chipsworking and again, we don't even expect prototypes until late next year.andO;Meanwhile, Intel is projecting its MPEG-capable third-generation chips toship in 1992, the same schedule that the rest of the industry is on.andM;We're more inclined to believe the projections of a company with a shippingproduct and a track record in microprocessors than those who are justtalking.andM;Three kinds of motion video in the futureandM;We're seeing more and more indications that there will be three choices whenusing motion video with personal computers.andM;* &quot;Managed video&quot; is what's mostly done today.andP;  The computer controls avideodisc player or other video source.andP;  It may also have a real-timedigitizer that manipulates the image.andM;* Integrated video without special hardware is beginning to show up.andP;  IBM andNational Geographic put 15 frame-per-second, small-window video into the new&quot;Mammals&quot; CD-ROM.andP;  Apple has shown a software-only playback, small-windowvideo playback from hard disk, code-named Road Pizza.andM;One of the more amazing things we've seen lately is technology beingdeveloped by Jim Rafferty, one of the founders of Cricket Software, later atC-Cube.andP;  Rafferty, who is working on his own, has demonstrated superb imagequality with a software-only playback, small-window application on aMacintosh II.andP;  Rafferty says he has also implemented the code onIBM-compatible systems.andP;  He's hoping to establish it as a cross-platformformat.andP;  Like Road Pizza, it's a hard disk-based application that doesn'tcompress enough to get to CD-ROM speeds.andM;* Third, of course, are integrated video products such as DVI, JPEG andothers that require special hardware to operate.andM;No compressionandM;There will be places for each of these.andP;  We had an interesting talk withFrank Brooks (who suggested the terms &quot;managed video&quot; and &quot;integrated video&quot;)and Russ Wetmore of Aapps Corp., which makes the MicroTV and DigiVideo cardsfor Macintosh.andP;  These are low-cost real-time digitizers that use a smallimage size.andP;  The major technical difference between these and more expensivecards, such as those from Mass Microsystems, Raster Ops and Videologic, isthat the Aapps cards send uncompressed digitized video across the computer'sbus, using the microprocessor.andP;  That puts serious limitations on the imagessize, but it allows the Mac to treat the video as though it's just anotherkind of data.andM;Aapps also has demonstrated direct video capture to a hard disk, althoughthat's not part of their products.andM;The significance of Aapps' technology is that once the data leaves the card,it can be stored, transmitted and otherwise manipulated without any specialhardware.andP;  In a sense, the video is compressed because it has been ditheredto an 8-bit (256-color) image, even though the card captures it at a muchhigher color depth.andM;You can tell that you're watching something other than normal video when youlook at the images on your computer, but you can also tell from your walletthat you didn't buy one of the other products.andM;This raises one of the main questions that underlies a lot of the arguingabout audio and video compression -- what level of quality has to be reached?andM;A sliding scale of qualityandM;Some people will tell you that the only technical quality that's acceptableis broadcast television because that's what people are accustomed to.andP;  Towhich we say, nonsense.andM;Millions of people watch cable television with a signal much worse thenbroadcast television.andP;  They rent videotapes that look pretty bad compared tocable and far worse than the original movies shown in theaters.andP;  And theymake home videos that are much worse than rented tapes.andP;  And some of thosevideos make it onto an extremely popular broadcast program, America'sFunniest Home Videos.andM;What's going on here?andM;The answer is pretty easy if you think about it.andP;  Convenience and interest inthe subject material, the content, balance against the need for technicalquality.andP;  In other words, the more convenient a medium is and the moremotivated the viewer/user is, the lower the technical quality needs to be.andM;It's important as well to note that the medium has to be appropriate to themessage.andP;  America's Most Thoughtful Home Videos probably wouldn't work.andM;This is a basic principal, one that also explains why our electronic mail canbe plain text, but USA Today, which fights for our attention, spends afortune on its appearance.andM;Television is in a constant battle to keep us tuned in, so it usually has toachieve very high quality production values.andP;  But interactive media, in whichyou can safely assume that the viewer/user chose to be there (interactivityimplies choice), the quality requirement is inherently lower.andM;When interactive multimedia is being used to persuade, motivate orindoctrinate, then the need for high-quality production is great.andP;  But oncethe user is involved, there's no more need to dress up the production than anold married couple have to dress up for dinner.andP;  Once in a while, okay, butnot as a rule.andM;It's a choice, just as you choose the quality of output in other situations.andO;When you print a document, there's a range from dot-matrix to phototypesetterto choose from.andP;  You wouldn't print an advertisement for Time magazine on adot-matrix printer, nor would you typeset a letter to an old friend.andM;Multimedia computing isn't about combining media.andP;  It's about choosing theright medium -- and the right quality level -- for the message.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
