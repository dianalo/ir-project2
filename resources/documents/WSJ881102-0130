Telephone Rentals, which rents and sells communications equipment mostly in the United Kingdom, has rejected the all-cash bid as &quot;wholly inadequate.&quot; Cable andamp; Wireless launched the bid in September, valuing all of Telephone Rentals at #283.8 million ($501.2 million).    Market speculation that Cable andamp; Wireless might raise its bid or that a higher competing bid might emerge, has driven the Telephone Rentals share price above the existing offer. The shares were quoted yesterday on London's stock exchange at midmorning at 343 pence, down five pence from Monday's close.    But Cable andamp; Wireless Deputy Chief Executive Gordon Owen apparently tried to dispel the perception that the company wanted Telephone Rentals at whatever price. &quot;If we don't acquire Telephone Rentals we will develop our own equipment distribution and maintenance business in the U.K.,&quot; he said.    Cable andamp; Wireless said it owns or received acceptances of its offer from holders of 2.32 million Telephone Rentals shares, representing 2.56% of the share capital. </TEXT></DOC>
