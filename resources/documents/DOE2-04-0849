Cells were radiolabeledand left for 24 h to allow the removal of rapidly degraded proteins.Remaining trichloroacetic acid-precipitable protein was degraded (t 1/2= 40-68 h) by an apparent first order process 60-86% sensitive to 10mM NH4Cl or 5 mM methylamine and greater than 95% inhibited by temperaturereduction to 18 degrees C. Thus, membrane proteins are selected for degradationin a time-dependent manner by a system which is sensitive to both 18degrees C and to lysosomotropic amines. When inhibitory conditions wereremoved after 40-48 h, degradation of 125I-labeled protein resumed atthe same rate as that seen in their absence. Since membrane proteinsdo not exhibit accelerated degradation after removal of inhibitory conditions,there can be no marking or sorting of those proteins destined for degradationduring the 40-h exposure to inhibitory conditions. Exposure to aminesor 18 degrees C did not affect the position of two-dimensionally resolvedlabeled polypeptides. Fractionation of labeled cells on Percoll gradientsafter 40 h of exposure to low temperature or amines showed that labeledprotein remained in the plasma membrane fractions of the gradient althoughshifted to a slightly lower buoyant density in the presence of amines.These results support the notion that selection of plasma membrane proteinsfor degradation requires their internalization into acidic vesicles.Lysosomotropic amines and reduced temperature interfere with the selectionprocess by preventing membrane fusion events.</TEXT></DOC>
