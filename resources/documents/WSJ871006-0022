Traders attributed the setback largely to a weaker dollar, higher commodity prices and growing indications that U.S. and Japanese monetary authorities may tighten credit further.    &quot;There's no reason to buy bonds right now,&quot; said Nobuaki Ohmura, a senior vice president at Daiwa Securities America Inc. &quot;There's a sentiment almost world-wide now that interest rates are going to rise in each major government bond market.&quot;    Among actively traded issues, the latest 30-year government bond fell one point, or $10 for each $1,000 face amount. Its yield surged to 9.8% from 9.69% last Friday. That was slightly below the 9.82% level of a week ago, which was the highest in nearly two years. Corporate and municipal bonds showed smaller declines.    In Japan, the government's closely watched 10-year bond rose to 6.18%, the highest yield since it was issued in April 1986. Since the middle of May, the yield has more than doubled from 2.55%. &quot;All the Japanese newspapers now are saying&quot; the Bank of Japan &quot;will hike interest rates by November,&quot; said Mr. Ohmura.    Pessimism among Japanese investors, who have purchased huge amounts of U.S. government securities in the past few years, could weigh heavily on the credit markets. The Treasury is scheduled to sell $7.25 billion of new four-year notes today and $6.75 billion of seven-year notes tomorrow, and some analysts predict lackluster demand from investors.    &quot;Investors are convinced the best investment decision is to wait for rates to go up,&quot; said Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist at Merrill Lynch. &quot;That's been the right decision for the past several months.&quot;    But in Tokyo, a senior Finance Ministry official indicated his opposition to any increase in the Japanese discount rate.    &quot;I don't see reasons for narrowing our interest-rate differentials&quot; with the U.S., said the official, who briefed reporters yesterday on condition that he remain anonymous. Speculation about the possibility of a Japanese discount rate increase has been sparked by recent indications of concern among Tokyo officials about wholesale-price increases and a surging money supply, and by the central bank's move last month to curb commercial-bank lending.    Bank of Japan officials have said they have no plans to increase the discount rate, but their comments have left some room for continued speculation.    Speculation also has been fueled by the fact that Japan's Economic Planning Agency has started a study on the impact a discount rate increase would have on the economy.    The bond market slump began early in the day. Several traders cited a survey of corporate purchasing managers showing the U.S. economy expanded further last month and indicating that additional strength lies ahead. Traders fear faster economic growth will translate into higher inflation and interest rates.    Moreover, speculation is growing that the Federal Reserve is preparing to raise short-term interest rates to emphasize its resolve to keep inflation in check. Traders said recent remarks by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan indicated that the Fed is focusing on the bond market as a barometer of inflation expectations, and that it could be forced to raise rates further.    &quot;It looks like the whole world thinks interest rates are going higher,&quot; said Michael K. Evans, president of Evans Economics Inc. in Washington. Investors &quot;are scared right now,&quot; he says. &quot;I think people may be waiting for the long bond to hit 10% before they buy.&quot;    But Mr. Evans contends that interest rates have peaked and are likely to decline in the next few months. &quot;People have exaggerated the amount of inflation we have,&quot; he says. He predicts that 30-year Treasury bond yields will drop to the 9% to 9 1/2% range in the next several months.    Whatever the case, the government bond market continues to be buffeted by uncertainty over the timing of government bond sales. Treasury officials may be forced to postpone plans to sell long-term bonds at the quarterly refunding next month as a result of budget legislation delays. &quot;It's a legitimate concern that could lead to a flatter yield curve,&quot; or a narrowing of the gap between long-term and short-term interest rates, said Mr. McCarthy of Merrill Lynch.    Reflecting this uncertainty as well as fear of tighter credit, the gap between yields on 10-year and 30-year notes and bonds has narrowed to about 0.10 percentage point recently from as much as 0.22 percentage point in August. The gap between two-year and 30-year government issues -- about 1.3 percentage points around two weeks ago -- narrowed to about 1.13 percentage points yesterday.    &quot;The market would love to see a smaller auction&quot; of 30-year bonds, said Mr. McCarthy. But instead, a delay of the entire auction could disrupt trading and eventually cause yields to rise because of a congested new issue market, he said.    In the bond market, the latest 30-year government issue, the Treasury's 8 7/8% bonds due 2017, slumped to 91 2/32 from 92 2/32 Friday. Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds fell 9.79 points to 1169.42. It ranged between 1168.38 and 1178.23.    The government's 8 5/8% notes due 1997 fell to 93 1/4 from 93 30/32 as the yield increased to 9.7% from 9.59%. The Treasury's four-year notes to be auctioned today were quoted in when-issued trading late yesterday at a yield of about 9.21%, while the seven-year notes to be auctioned tomorrow were quoted at 9.57%.    Rates were mixed on short-term Treasury bills at the government's regular weekly auction yesterday. The average rate on new 13-week bills fell to 6.49% from 6.59% at the previous auction last week. But the average rate on new 26-week bills rose to 6.96% from 6.83%.    The rate on federal funds, or reserves that banks lend each other overnight, averaged 7.49% yesterday, according to an estimate by Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.) Inc. That was up from 7.42% last Friday.    In the corporate new issue market, New York Telephone Co. sold $300 million of notes due October 1992. Underwriters led by Salomon Brothers Inc. priced the 9 5/8% notes at 99.824 to yield 9.67%, or 0.43 percentage point more than the Treasury's five-year notes. The issue is rated double-A-3 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and double-A-plus by Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.    In the municipal market, underwriters led by Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. tentatively priced a $49.1 million issue of revenue bonds by New York State Energy Research and Development Authority for Consolidated Edison Co. of New York. The 9 1/4% bonds, due 2022, were priced at par, Kidder Peabody said.    Here are the details of yesterday's Treasury bill auction:    Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.                                13-Week           26-Week   Applications ......... $21,561,210,000   $23,705,865,000   Accepted bids ......... $6,404,380,000    $6,400,615,000   Accepted at low price ..           43%               81%   Accepted noncompet'ly.. $1,139,780,000      $972,380,000   Average price (Rate) .. 98.359 (6.49%)    96.481 (6.96%)   High price (Rate) ..... 98.380 (6.41%)    96.491 (6.94%)   Low price (Rate) ...... 98.352 (6.52%)    96.471 (6.98%)   Coupon equivalent .....          6.71%             7.33%   Both issues are dated Oct. 8.
