JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The government says most of the country'sschools are complying with federal asbestos regulations, but morethan 3,000 schools still have not submitted asbestos managementplans required a year ago.   The Environmental Protection Agency acknowledged many schoolshave been slow in complying with a 1986 law that requiredinspections for asbestos in school buildings and establisheddeadlines for developing asbestos management plans and remedialwork if necessary.   Asbestos is a cancer-causing substance once widely use forinsulation. It is particularly dangerous in exposed fiber formwhere tiny particles are easily spread in the air.   The EPA said Wednesday that as of late September, about 94percent of the 50,544 local school agencies or individual schoolssubject to the federal requirements have submitted management plansto state officials.   The plans were due in October 1988, but many schools receivedextensions to last May. Even then, some schools did not submittheir complete action plans until just recently, officials said.   The EPA statistics on how fast the schools are dealing with thehealth matter represented reporting by both public and privateschools.   EPA spokesman Sean McElheny said as of late September, about 6percent, or 3,094 of the school entities, had not submitted therequired asbestos management plans to state agencies. He said theEPA had no statistics on how many school had actually begun work toremedy asbestos problems.   Agency officials, nevertheless, were pleased with the 94 percentrate of compliance to the reporting requirement.   ``We are greatly pleased with the high rate of compliance,''said EPA Assistant Administrator Linda Fisher. ``Our nation'sschools are serious about tackling the asbestos problem.''   It was unclear from the EPA statistics how many school buildingswere represented by the reporting requirements. McElheny said insome cases states reported actions by individual schools, while inother cases reports were submitted on the basis of ``localeducation agencies'' which could include anywhere from a singleschool to a large metropolitan school district.   Also, there was no breakdown available on the performance ofprivate schools vs. public school systems.   ``We don't know how many (of the reports) were private and howmany were public schools,'' McElheny said.   Officials said schools in California were not included in thecompliance figure because the state not yet completed processingthe latest submissions due to budget constraints.   The 1986 law required school officials to begin implementing theaction plans by July 9, 1989. But many schools had yet to submitthe management plans by that date.   According to EPA requirements, schools have several options fordealing with asbestos in buildings, from removing it altogether tokeeping it in place and sealing it off from school occupants.   Ms. Fisher said often the best approach may be to seal theasbestos because attempts to remove it might throw small asbestosparticles might be thrown into the air.</TEXT></DOC>
