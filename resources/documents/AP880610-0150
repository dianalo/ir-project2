Radicals hurled rocks and firebombs,trying to fight their way through.   About 60,000 riot police blanketed the South Korean capital androads leading north to disperse students trying to reach the border30 miles away. Fierce street clashes erupted at Yonsei Universityas about 5,000 screaming students tried to fight their way out.   An estimated 8,000 troopers surrounding the school firedhundreds of tear gas bombs into the charging students. Both sideshurled rocks and bricks.   Police and protesters with skin burns or wounds streaming bloodstaggered or were carried to safety. Authorities didn't say howmany people were injured.   North Korea's Korean Central News Agency said in a reportmonitored in Tokyo that delegates and students from the Northwaited at the truce village of Panmunjom for the southern students.   Ko Ung Sam, head of the delegation, was quoted as saying, ``Theresponsibility for the failure of the talks rests entirely with theU.S. imperialists and the South Korean rulers.''   Police and press reports indicated at least 700 students werearrested in various parts of South Korea. Most detainees wereexpected to be held briefly.   Radical students _ who government officials say account for just2 percent to 3 percent of the nation's 1 million students _ calledthe march to force reunification of the communist North and thepro-Western South.   The radicals claim the United States, which has 42,000 troops inSouth Korea, enforces partition to rule the South. The protestswere vehemently anti-American.   ``Let's go and meet our brothers from the North!'' the studentsat Yonsei yelled, beating drums and singing revolutionary songs.``Yankee go home!'' yelled others. ``Skin the Yankee imperialists!''   ``We call for struggle of the masses for unification and againstdictatorship!'' a speaker shouted as students cheered.   Riot troopers hit by firebombs screamed in agony as otherofficers frantically beat out the flames. Students wielding clubsattacked police who tried to ward off blows with riot shields.   A dozen armored police vans with multiple tear gas launchersfired barrages of gas bombs to hold back attacking protesters aspolice martial arts squads attacked. Students tried to immobilizethe vans with firebombs and clubs.   Students in nearby sidestreets tried to attack police frombehind and stationed themselves on several high rooftops.   Clashes broke out in at least six provincial cities as studentssupporting the march clashed with police. Dozens of students werearrested at bus and train stations as they tried to reach Seoul forthe march.   At Seoul's railway station, thousands of riot police threw teargas grenades to break up crowds of students trying to get to trainsto the border. Some students hurled rocks and firebombs, but mostdid not fight back.   The police detained hundreds of students, beating and kickingdetainees as they dragged them away. Students had blood streamingfrom their faces.   Their attempts to assemble in various parts of Seoul failedrepeatedly. About 4,000 students who staged a sit-down strike inthe north of Seoul were dispersed by charging police firing teargas.   Riot squads guarded train and bus stations to stop students fromgetting to Panmunjom, in the demilitarized zone. About 40 studentswho sneaked through were arrested near the border, which isoff-limits to civilians.   Large detachments of riot police stood guard at intersectionsand along main streets in Seoul. Riot squads surrounded governmentbuildings and U.S. diplomatic facilities to prevent attacks.   Many onlookers criticized the protesters, saying they wereleftists or fools who would help the communist North conquer theSouth.   ``Let them go to the North and live there for a few months,''said Chung Soon-im, a 38-year-old homemaker. ``They need to learnby experience what is good and bad.''   A uniformed army captain said: ``I would like to shoot them.They are too naive or idiots.''   Most South Koreans want reunification with the North but fearthe North is determined eventually to conquer the South.   North Korea invaded the South in 1950 to launch the Korean Warand the two nations remain bitter enemies with no ties or contacts.   The radicals, a small but powerful minority on campuses, denythey are communists and insist reunfication overrides ideologicalconsiderations.</TEXT></DOC>
