Mr. David, considered the central figure in the case, admitted in November 1986 that he orchestrated an insider-trading scheme using confidential information about pending business transactions stolen from the New York law firm where he was an associate.    No fines were included in the sentence. However, Mr. David, now driving a cab for a living, is paying back as much as $150,000 in civil penalties to the Securities and Exchange Commission to settle civil charges related to the scheme. Mr. David also faces likely disbarment. The last of the &quot;Yuppie Five&quot; to be sentenced, Mr. David was charged with four felony counts including obstruction of justice, conspiracy, securities fraud and mail fraud.    In issuing the sentence in federal district court here, Judge John F. Keenan called Mr. David &quot;an intelligent young man from a very good family who destroyed an excellent career.&quot; Mr. David's actions, said Judge Keenan, &quot;completely disrupted the forces of the free market and helped to create cynicism among the general populace.&quot; Further, the judge said, if Mr. David had not cooperated with the SEC and federal investigators over the past two years, his sentence would have been more severe.    Mr. David was part of a ring, broken up by the SEC in 1986, of four young Wall Street professionals and a client of one of them -- all known as the &quot;Yuppie Five&quot; -- who traded in securities involved in six proposed or anticipated corporate takeovers using nonpublic information. The case has nothing to do with investigations of insder trading by Ivan F. Boesky and Dennis B. Levine, the government has said.    In court yesterday, Mr. David's attorney, Darrell Fennell of the law firm Fennell andamp; Minkoff, stressed that his client was not &quot;a kingpin in some vast network of insider trading,&quot; and that it was unfair to make Mr. David a &quot;symbol of Yuppie greed.&quot; Just two years out of law school, Mr. David was a &quot;naive professional involved with other equally naive professionals.&quot; Working now as a cab driver earning $22,000 last year -- and giving $5,000 to the SEC each year -- Mr. David is not a wealthy man, said Mr. Fennell, urging the judge to issue a lenient sentence.    &quot;He is deeply in debt with no prospect of a new career and facing disbarment or suspension,&quot; said Mr. Fennell.    Mr. David's four co-conspirators -- Andrew Solomon, formerly of the arbitrage firm of Marcus Schloss and Co.; Robert Salsbury, formerly an arbitrage analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.; Morton Shapiro, a former stock broker at Moseley, Hallgarten, Estabrook andamp; Weeden Inc.; and Daniel J. Silverman, the holder of a securities trading account at Moseley -- entered guilty pleas and have also cooperated with the government. In court, Mr. David urged the judge to allow him to &quot;rebuild my life as I had tried to do.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
