The Fed has sharply increased its purchases of Treasurysecurities since 1990, apparently to allow for more borrowingin the private sector and help spur the economy. Fed ChairmanAlan Greenspan and other board governors claim they will keepa lid on inflation. But a growing number of economists viewthe Fed's new willingness to take on more of the debt asinflationary in the long run.</LP><TEXT>   The Fed's share of the mounting debt pile remains small --less than 3% of a total that's fast approaching $12 trillion.But this share has grown markedly since 1990, in contrast toa previous pattern of persistent shrinkage. Fed holdings ofU.S. government securities have risen more than 33% in lessthan two years; in the same period, total debt rose less than10% and federal debt about 20%.   &quot;The Fed's recent willingness to hold more of the debtsignifies a sea change,&quot; says Edward S. Hyman, president ofISI Group Inc. He views the change as &quot;a bad development&quot;since it threatens ultimately to cause steeper priceincreases. But he also stresses that the lead times betweenFed moves to hold more debt and increased inflation tend tobe long.   &quot;It's probably not too late for the Fed to change courseand avert a new inflationary surge,&quot; he says.   For now, &quot;by taking on more of the total debt itself, theFed is allowing more room in the credit markets for privateborrowers,&quot; says Robert H. Parks, an economic consultant inNew York. Otherwise, interest rates would tend to be higherand less affordable, he says, adding, &quot;The Fed in effect isfinancing Treasury borrowing with newly created money.&quot;   To increase its debt holdings, the Fed may buy governmentsecurities directly from the Treasury, but more typically itdoes so in the open market. Bank reserves are created in theprocess, since the Fed can &quot;pay&quot; simply by crediting theamount of its purchases to the account of the bank involvedin the transaction. As a result, money is born.   Economists call the process debt monetization. Without it,rising federal deficits tend merely to shuffle spending tothe government sector from the private sector, rather thanstimulate the economy as a whole.   For all the short-term benefits, a rising money supply, ifit goes on long enough and is sharp enough, can eventuallyoutstrip the available supply of goods and services and sofuel inflation. The government's most &quot;potent financingtechnique&quot; is for the Fed &quot;to monetize the Treasury's debt bypurchasing it,&quot; says William C. Melton, a former Fed officialwho now serves as chief economist of IDS Financial ServicesInc.   The recent shift in the Fed's overall debt holdings, asopposed to how much of the total is in short-term orlong-term securities, has received relatively little notice.Efforts to assess Fed policy have focused mainly on suchfamiliar gauges as the federal funds rate, which banks chargeone another on short-term loans, and on aggregates that gaugethe money supply.   By and large, these well-publicized indicators suggest aneffort by the Fed to loosen the monetary reins. But thisendeavor has occasionally seemed halting and marked bycaution. The federal funds rate, near 4%, is lower than threemonths ago, but slightly higher than a few weeks ago. M1, arelatively narrow measure of the money supply, has climbedbriskly for many months. But the broader M2, M3 and M4aggregates have not. Adjusted for inflation, all three arelower now than three years ago.   There's no such ambivalence in the Fed's recent assumptionof more of the debt. In the first quarter of 1990, Fedholdings of U.S. government securities amounted to just over$233.5 billion. The total has been rising sharply ever since,surpassing $312 billion in the final quarter of 1991.   As the chart indicates, substantial time often may elapsebetween shifts in the Fed's willingness to assume debt anddevelopments on the price front. (see accompanyingillustration -- WSJ March 17, 1992) The Fed monetized arising portion of debt from the early 1960s until nearly theend of the decade, and the trend continued at a slower, moreerratic pace until 1976. Yet, inflation remained relativelydormant until the latter half of the 1960s.   A footnote: Unlike the present situation, the Fed'smonetizing through the 1960s can hardly be viewed as aneffort to relieve credit markets overburdened by federaldeficits. Through most of the period, the federal budget wasin or close to balance.   The pattern from 1976 to 1990 also shows a long lagbetween shifts in the Fed's debt share and pricedevelopments. The Fed's share of debt fell substantially, aprocess that economists call demonetization and regard asdisinflationary, just as monetization is deemed inflationary.But inflation intensified sharply from 1978 to 1980, wellafter the Fed's share of debt had begun to fall. Asdemonetizing continued, inflation finally did abate.   Most economists look for the Fed to adopt a morerestrictive policy once the recovery gains strength and thepresidential election is over. Some believe that this policyshift may already be at hand. But the hazard is that thiscould squeeze hardpressed private borrowers, especially withthe federal budget deficit near $400 billion and the economyreviving. The upshot could be appreciably higher interestrates and, once again, a stalled recovery or a new recession.   &quot;The Fed will find it very hard to reverse its recentpolicy of debt monetization,&quot; says Lacy H. Hunt, chiefeconomist in New York for Hongkong Bank Group. He warns thatany return to debt demonetization would be &quot;catastrophic&quot; forthe recovery, which he believes finally got under way inFebruary.   Some economists disagree with such assessments and cautionthat the inflationary die is already cast, whatever the Feddecides to do in coming months.&quot;The Fed has already passedthe flash point for inflation,&quot; claims H. Erich Heinemann,chief economist of Ladenburg, Thalmann andamp; Co.</TEXT></DOC>
