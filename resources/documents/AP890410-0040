Car thefts and burglaries jumped at least 9 percent last year tolead the increase in crimes reported by victims ot the NationalCrime Survey, the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statisticssaid Sunday.   Overall, the number of crimes reported to the survey increasedfrom 35.3 million in 1987 to 35.9 million, according to thepreliminary results for 1988.   ``The increase reverses a declining trend that began in 1981,''said Joseph Besette, acting director of the Bureau of JusticeStatistics. ``Crime rates reached their lowest levels in 1986, whenthere were fewer offenses for most categories than at any timesince the National Crime Survey commenced in 1973.''   Preliminary results for 1988 showed a 1.2 percent increase inpersonal crimes, including rape, robbery, assault and theft.   Household crimes went up 2.6 percent from 1987, the study said.That included a 9 percent jump in completed break-ins.   Motor vehicle thefts went up 9.6 percent from 1.4 million to 1.6million, according to the study. The study also showed a 6 percentincrease in assaults, including a 9.3 percent jump in aggravatedassaults.   The growth in crime last year may have resulted in part to anincrease in the nation's population, the department said.   The survey of 99,000 people over age 12 in 49,000 households isconducted every six months by U.S. Census Bureau representatives todetermine who has become a crime victim. The figures are based oncrimes reported by the victims to the survey, not to policeauthorities.   The survey found a 12.8 percent increase in rapes, but theresult was not considered statistically significant, the JusticeDepartment said. At the same time there was a 9.3 percent decreasein rapes reported to police.</TEXT></DOC>
