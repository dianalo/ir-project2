Currently, that market has been left to vendors such asAscend Communications, which is providing high-capacity ISDN front ends tomainframes and LANs.andM;Although the potential exists for a general-purpose PRI ISDN communicationsgateway, IBM and Teleos might not get such a product out the door right away.andO;Their focus now is on the CallPath features, which provide an interesting andcost-effective method for routing voice and data traffic around a network.andO;One advantage with the Teleos gear is that it can operate without a PBX.andP;  Allphone functions (including call transfer and hold) can be done through thekeyboard.andM;Teleos and IBM expect to make use of ISDN's D signaling channel for a varietyof purposes, one of which is security.andP;  In one possible use of the CallPathsystem, a doctor with a Teleos PRI unit could dial into a hospital LAN toretrieve patient records such as X-ray images and lab results.andP;  The AutomaticNumber Identification feature of ISDN would enable the hospital to verify theidentity of the doctor and authorize him or her to see the records.andP;  Thiscould also work in a LAN environment as an additional layer of security forremote users dialing into the LAN.andM;Another use of the D channel is the conventional application of automatingthe outgoing and incoming call distribution.andP;  Collection agencies could usethe AS/400 to download the phone numbers of delinquent accounts to the Teleosunit, which would monitor the status of the call.andM;When the call has been connected and a person is on the line, the call can beswitched to a human operator.andP;  Incoming calls to a telemarketing firm couldbe assigned to the appropriate operator, depending on where people arecalling from.andM;Applications enabled by CallPath, such as telemarketing, are the bread andbutter of ISDN systems.andP;  It will be interesting to see IBM and Teleos buildon the PRI/LAN connection to offer more flexible data communications to thenetwork manager.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
