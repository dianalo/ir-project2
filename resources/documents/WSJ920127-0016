Better hurry. The Quebec government is getting out of theasbestos business after spending hundreds of millions ofdollars to prop up and partially &quot;nationalize&quot; the province'sasbestos industry.</LP><TEXT>   The Quebec government quietly invited bids last month forwholly owned Bell Asbestos Mines Ltd. and the government's54.6% stake in Asbestos Corp. The government has received&quot;more than one offer,&quot; said a spokeswoman for Quebec'sminister of energy and resources. Although the governmenthasn't set a deadline, the spokeswoman said that &quot;we wouldlike to complete (the planned sale) quickly.&quot;   The saga of the Quebec government's asbestos adventureswon't necessarily end with a quick sale. Some minorityshareholders of Asbestos Corp. are trying to force thegovernment to buy them out at nearly 10 times the currentmarket price. In a complex transaction completed in 1986, aQuebec government agency bought General Dynamics Corp.'s54.6% stake in Asbestos Corp. for about 170 million Canadiandollars (US$147 million), or about C$80 a share. Thegovernment never made a follow-up offer to minorityshareholders. On the Montreal Exchange, thinly tradedAsbestos Corp. closed Friday at C$8.50, up 25 Canadian cents.   More than five years after Quebec bought GeneralDynamics's stake, a tenacious group of shareholders that saysit represents holders of about 500,000 Asbestos Corp. sharesis still fighting for a follow-up offer. The staff of theOntario Securities Commission agrees with the group. The OSClawyers said in a 1988 notice calling a hearing on the affairthat the Quebec government was obligated to make a follow-upoffer at C$80 a share for the minority-held shares. However,the commission hasn't ruled yet.   The Ontario hearing is on hold, pending the result of alegal challenge of the commission's jurisdiction by theQuebec government. Quebec lost in a lower court but hasappealed. Separately, the Quebec Securities Commission ruledthat it doesn't have authority over Quebec governmentagencies. The shareholders group has appealed that decision.(Canada doesn't have a national securities commission.)   &quot;It was a very rotten deal,&quot; says F. Warren Hurst, aretired stock broker who co-chairs the Asbestos Corp.shareholders group. &quot;We were left high and dry,&quot; Mr. Hurstsaid, adding the that group doesn't have any plans to give upits fight.   Mr. Hurst and Alfred L. J. Page, an attorney for thegroup, said they are both mystified by a statement releasedby Asbestos Corp. Friday night. In the statement, AsbestosCorp. said it was informed that the Quebec government agencyintends to sell its stake. Then Asbestos Corp. added: &quot;Shouldthe sale of these interests take place, S.N.A. (thegovernment agency) and the government of Quebec would assumetheir responsibilities under securities legislation arisingfrom previous acquisitions.&quot;   The Quebec government spokeswoman said she didn't knowwhat that means. She added that the government's decision tosell &quot;doesn't affect the minority-held shares.&quot; She didn'telaborate. Benoit Cartier, president of Asbestos Corp.,didn't return calls.   Asbestos Corp. and Bell Asbestos Mines each own oneasbestos mine and 22.5% of a limited partnership in ThetfordMines, Quebec, that operates the mines. The partnership, LABChrysotile Inc., also operates a third mine owned byinvestors led by Jean Dupere, president of LAB Chrysotile.Mr. Dupere's group owns the remaining 55% of LAB Chrysotile,said Clement Bernier, senior vice president.   Mr. Bernier said that LAB Chrysotile produced about350,000 metric tons of asbestos fiber last year and wasprofitable. He declined to provide specific figures, addingthat the partnership doesn't publish its results. He said LABChrysotile is the largest producer of asbestos outside theformer Soviet Union.   Mr. Bernier said that Mr. Dupere's group made an offer tothe government for Bell Asbestos Mines and the stake inAsbestos Corp. He said that he also understands thegovernment has received one other serious offer. He declinedto elaborate. Mr. Dupere was skiing in Europe and couldn't bereached for comment.   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          A QUEBEC GOVERNMENT AGENCY owns 54.6% of Asbestos Corp.The percentage was incorrect in some editions yesterday.Also, Benoit Cartier is chairman and acting chief executiveofficer of Asbestos Corp.
