Such aframework should include a clear definition of waste reduction, a setof policy evaluation criteria, consideration of a variety of policy approaches,and targeting of policies to appropriately distinguished sectors of wastegenerators. Three general approaches are possible to encourage wastereduction: (a) regulatory approaches; (b) financial incentives and/ordisincentives; (c) research and education.
