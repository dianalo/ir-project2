Better screening and training of recruits, and conscientiousleadership, have brought the police department a well-deserved reputation forprofessionalism.;    The shooting of a San Jose policeman Tuesday during araid on a suspected drug house underscores the danger of police work and thehigh standards placed on officers.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  . . . AND PROMOTE CONFIDENCEALVARADO HAS A GOOD IDEA TO SET UP AN OFFICETO LOOK INTO CITIZEN COMPLAINTS  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Editorials  </MEMO><TEXT>     Yet no police department is free of cops who cannot keep themselves undercontrol. Communities often don't know the extent and nature of policemisconduct. A state privacy law combined with investigation and reportingprocedures tend to keep brutality complaints sealed.;    At CouncilwomanBlanca Alvarado's suggestion, the City Council on Tuesday loosened the lid onbrutality complaints. A City Hall official will receive and track complaintsfrom people who don't trust the police to investigate themselves.;    The ideais exactly what's needed. The tightly controlled process for investigatingcomplaints is designed to protect officers from premature public judgment, butit does little to promote public confidence in law enforcement.;    The sameoffice might also report on the number, nature and disposition of complaints.This should be public information, but just how much detail legally can bemade public isn't clear. Alvarado appropriately asked city attorneys to studythe matter.  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910321  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  212  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday March 21, 199100081128,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
