Ronald Mowrey spent two days this week taking inventory ofproperty at Warner's lush, 600-acre farm just east of Cincinnati inClermont County. Mowrey is to oversee sale of the farm and contents,under supervision of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Jacksonville, Fla.   The creditors sued Warner after the March 1985 collapse ofCincinnati-based Home State. Warner, 70, was convicted on Ohiofelony charges after the collapse, but is appealing the convictions.   Home State's collapse triggered a statewide thrift crisis.   Mowrey said he believes he will have Warner's farm and householdfurnishings assessed and ready for auction or private sale _whichever will bring in the most money _ within 30 to 40 days.   The property also includes antique tables and chairs, crystalwine glasses, exercise equipment, an antique hat stand, leatherchairs and a fur rug, along with less exotic washers and dryers andvacuum cleaners.   There are also 30 to 40 head of cattle and a bull on the farm, hesaid.   ``There is a real air of sadness there,'' Mowrey said Wednesday.``There are pictures of the family and the children on the tables.There are pictures of them growing up, doing things as a family. Ithas a real ring of sadness.''   Mowrey, a lawyer and former FBI agent from Jacksonville, tookcontrol of Warner's assets after U.S. Bankruptcy Judge GeorgeProctor changed Warner's proceedings last month from a Chapter 11 toa Chapter 7 action, under which assets are sold to satisfycreditors' claims.   Warner's creditors have claimed they are owed more than $3billion.   The farm, called Warnerton, will be sold separately. Mowrey saidone buyer has offered $4 million for about 400 of the 600 acres. Ifappraisers think this is fair to the creditors, the offer will beaccepted, Mowrey said.   The dozens of thoroughbred horses that once grazed the pasturesare gone. Creditors' lawyers say most of the horses were apparentlytransferred to Warner's son, Marvin Warner Jr., who owns a horsefarm in Lexington, Ky.   Mowrey said he will make a similar inventory and assessment ofWarner's newer 400-acre horse farm in Ocala, Fla., next week. UnderFlorida's homestead law, a person in bankruptcy proceedings cannotbe deprived of his home, even to pay creditors. A debtor is allowedup to 160 acres outside a city as a ``home'' exemption, unless thecourt decrees otherwise.   Warner's creditors contend he improperly spent money which shouldhave gone to his creditors to buy, stock and furnish his Ocalaproperty. They are asking that the court disallow the farm as anexemption.   Warner has asked Proctor to change his proceedings to a Chapter12 action, which would exempt Warner from forced liquidation bylabeling him a farmer. A Chapter 12 action is designed to protectfarmers from foreclosure.   Mowrey said the decision will be up to the judge, but said hisexamination has convinced him Warner probably would not qualify as afarmer.   Mowrey said he estimates Warner has assets of between $3 millionto $40 million, far short of what creditors are seeking. Warner, incourt papers filed in the early 1980s, declared his worth at between$85 million and $100 million.</TEXT></DOC>
