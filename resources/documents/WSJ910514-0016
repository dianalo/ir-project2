That's just one lesson of a case filed against Texaco byEmma S. Vaughn, a former contract analyst for the company.Ms. Vaughn lost her job when the company's land departmentdecided to fire its two weakest performers to cut costs. Butshe sued the company, alleging that she hadn't received aproper performance evaluation or adequate counseling becauseshe was black.   At the trial, a Texaco manager testified that the companyhad avoided confrontations with Ms. Vaughn about her workbecause managers wanted to avoid charges of racialdiscrimination.   A federal appeals court in New Orleans ruled that &quot;Texacodid not afford Vaughn the same opportunity to improve herperformance . . . as it did its white employees. . . . AsTexaco acknowledges, she was once its `highest rankedcontract analyst.'&quot;   Debra L. Raskin of New York, who represents plaintiffs indiscrimination cases, says the ruling is significant becausethe court recognized that &quot;termination cannot be looked at ina vacuum.&quot;   Kenneth J. Beck, Ms. Vaughn's lawyer, says the decisionmeans that, &quot;if you're going to counsel one employee, thenyou have to counsel all employees.&quot;   Texaco won't appeal, according to its lawyer, Albert H.Hanemann Jr. He says the parties are in the process ofnegotiating a damage settlement.                                                                                                          Lawyers Tell Cohabitants   To Put It in Writing                                                                                                          WHAT LEGAL protections exist for parting cohabitants?   None, say lawyers who counsel unmarried couples.   In 1976, the California Court of Appeals ruled in thehighly publicized Lee Marvin &quot;palimony&quot; case that courtscould divide spousal equivalents' property according to thecouple's agreements and &quot;their reasonable expectations.&quot; Butthe rights of parting unmarried couples haven't beenclarified much since then, and courts have issued manyconflicting opinions.   Johnette Duff and George G. Truitt, a lawyer andaccountant who live together, decided to write &quot;The SpousalEquivalent Handbook&quot; after they realized they knew littleabout their rights as a couple.   Their advice to unmarried couples: put it in writing.   &quot;Until the laws begin to offer more protection, spousalequivalents who neglect to make provisions for each other inthe event of death or dissolution of the relationship aregambling with their futures,&quot; the couple writes in the book.One danger of not putting agreements in writing is thatproperty accumulated during a relationship won't be dividedequitably because it is only in one person's name.   Donn C. Fullenweider, a Houston divorce lawyer, alsobelieves that a written agreement is the best course ofaction for unmarried couples. But that, he adds, &quot;is an idealsituation that seldom happens&quot; because couples view it as&quot;anti-romantic.&quot;                                                                                                          Budget Cuts Crimp   Educational Programs                                                                                                          CONTINUING education for lawyers is fast becoming acasualty of the recession.   Law firms view continuing legal education as an easybudget cut, program administrators say. Attendance at suchcourses has dropped 10% to 15%, they say, even though it'smandatory in about two-thirds of the states.   &quot;There's a shutting off of the valve, at leasttemporarily, to save money,&quot; says Victor J. Rubino, executivedirector of the Practising Law Institute in New York.Tuitions vary; program administrators say the real cost tolaw firms is the loss of time billed.   Legal educators, however, say the cuts will result inlong-term losses for law firms and their clients. &quot;In themodern world, with technological and social changes that{affect} law and law practice almost on a daily basis, itisn't a luxury that should be tossed off quickly,&quot; says Mr.Rubino.   The cutbacks have taken a toll on educational institutionsas well. Last year, the Illinois Institute for ContinuingLegal Education filed for bankruptcy court protection. Thedrop in enrollment was only one of its problems, butexecutive director Charles C. Bingaman says the institute'srecently filed reorganization plan anticipates that it willoffer fewer courses and concentrate on its publication andtape business in the future.                                                                                                          Studying the High Cost   Of Copying Court Papers                                                                                                          HIGH photocopying fees impede the public's access to courtdocuments, a congressman argues.   Most federal courts have long charged 50 cents a page tocopy documents. A recent Government Accounting Office reportrequested by Rep. Bob Wise (D., W.Va.), found that the courtsystem's administrative arms have reviewed the price fourtimes in the past 10 years but have decided not to lower it.The price is much higher than fees imposed by most privatecopying services. One study found that court clerks viewedthe fee as &quot;a proven and reliable method of preventingfrivolous and irresponsible requests for copy services.&quot;   Rep. Wise is now pressing the Administrative Office of theU.S. Courts to lower its copying fees. &quot;It's a question ofaccessibility for the public,&quot; he says. He notes that feescharged by federal courts may be 10 times the actual cost ofcopying documents.   L. Ralph Mecham, director of the administrative office,says Rep. Wise's figuring doesn't take into account clerktime for handling court files. A committee of judges willsoon study the issue yet again.</TEXT></DOC>
