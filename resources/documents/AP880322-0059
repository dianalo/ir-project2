(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Scientists have redesigned a potentnatural poison so that it seeks out and kills cancer cells in thetest tube, signaling a possible new route for fighting some tumors,a scientist says.   The poison, so strong that a dose the size of a salt grain cankill a person, may be harnessed for fighting breast cancers thathave spread elsewhere in the body, and some lung and brain tumors,according to Ira Pastan of the National Cancer Institute.   The strategy takes advantage of the fact that some cancer cellsdisplay on their surface certain kinds of protein structures calledreceptors. Specific substances bind to each kind of receptor beforethey enter the cell.   Normal cells have receptors too, but the new work focuses onreceptors that are far more numerous on cancer cells, Pastan toldscience writers at a seminar sponsored by the American CancerSociety.   Using genetic engineering, scientists essentially redesigned thegene that a common bacterium called Pseudomonas aeruginosa uses toproduce its potent poison, called an endotoxin. The bacteria cancause pink eye, bacterial meningitis and pneumonia.   One portion of the endotoxin molecule seeks out normal cells andbinds to them. Scientists deleted the portion of the generesponsible for creating that portion and substituted another, sothat the endotoxin produced by the gene would seek out cancer cellsinstead.   Then they put the altered gene into a second kind of bacteriumand put it to work. The bacterium churned out multiple copies ofthe cancer-seeking version of the poison.   Pastan said Monday that scientists have experimented with twotypes of redesigned poison, each geared to a different receptor oncancer cells.   One, the receptor for a hormone called interleukin-2, is foundin high concentrations on white blood cells in a disease calledadult T-cell leukemia, which is found chiefly in the Caribbean areaand Japan, Pastan said.   The other receptor binds either of two growth-stimulatingsubstances, called epidermal growth factor or transforming growthfactor alpha. It is found in abundance in some lung cancer cells,breast cancer cells and brain tumors called glioblastomas, he said.   Glioblastomas are untreatable now, Pastan said.   In test tube experiments, the redesigned poisons sought out andkilled cancer cells while largely ignoring normal cells, he said.The poison works by entering a cell and sabotaging the cell'sprotein-making machinery.   Pastan said such ``oncotoxins'' represent a step beyond asimilar approach, which is attaching a poison to a protein calledan antibody that seeks out cancer cells. That has been studied forsome years, and Pastan said the antibody approach is now beingstudied in four ovarian cancer patients at the cancer institute.   Their doses are aimed at looking for side effects, and are toolow to expect any effect against their tumors, he said.   Dick Rauscher, cancer society senior vice president forresearch, called Pastan's new approach ``very promising.''   It may one day be able to circumvent a problem with the antibodysystem, that the body's immune system quickly recognizes theantibody-poison combination as foreign and tries to destroy it, hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
