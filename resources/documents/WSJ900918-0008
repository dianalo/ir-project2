Bacon   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>09/18/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B1</SO><IN>HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS, MEDICINE, DENTISTRY (HEA)</IN><GV>CONGRESS (CNG)</GV><LP>   WASHINGTON -- Foreign-educated doctors are stepping upchallenges to U.S. licensing practices they say discriminateagainst them.   More than 130,000 doctors -- 21% of the U.S. total -- wereeducated in foreign medical schools. Most of these areforeign-born, though some 20,000 are Americans who tookmedical degrees abroad, often because they couldn't get intoU.S. medical schools.</LP><TEXT>   Foreign medical graduates come from all over the world,but the largest numbers have migrated here from India and thePhilippines. They have moved into all fields of Americanmedicine, and according to an American Hospital Associationstudy, they play a particularly important role in caring forindigent populations in such cities as New York, Detroit andChicago. About half of the foreign-educated physicianspractice in five states: New York, California, Florida,Illinois and New Jersey.   Despite the role of foreign graduates in U.S. medicine,&quot;discrimination against fully trained and qualified foreignmedical graduates in the areas of jobs, promotions, hospitalprivileges, licensing, reciprocity and other facets ofmedical practice&quot; is common, says Navin Shah of theInternational Association of American Physicians. &quot;Underfalse pretense of quality patient care, the authorities areclandestinely eliminating the foreign medical graduates fromthe practice of medicine&quot; in order to protect jobs forAmerican-educated physicians, he charges.   Munni Setty says she ran into difficulty when she sought alicense to practice in Colorado in 1988. After graduatingfrom medical school in India in 1982, she completed athree-year residency in Chicago, won certification as aspecialist in internal medicine and received licenses topractice in California and Illinois. For American medicalschool graduates licensed to practice in one state, it's easyto win licenses in other states, but Dr. Setty says sheencountered a lengthy delay in Colorado.   Among other things, the Colorado State Board of MedicalExaminers asked her to supply resumes of her medical schoolprofessors at the University of Bombay. &quot;This was ratherimpractical and almost impossible to obtain,&quot; she says. &quot;Ithink it was just purely discrimination.&quot;   Thomas Beckett, administrator of the Colorado board, says:&quot;I emphatically deny it. Every board has a responsibility todetermine that applicants go to a decent medical school.&quot; Henotes that state licensing laws require boards to developways to assess foreign medical schools. &quot;Some states ask howmany books there are in the library,&quot; he says.   Because many foreign graduates attended Third Worldmedical schools where standards of teaching, technology andclinical practice differ significantly from those in U.S.medical schools, state licensing officials say they must relyon a series of tests and credential checks to determine ifforeign graduates are qualified to practice. But, underpressure from foreign-educated doctors, U.S. officials in thepast few years have streamlined the process for foreigngraduates.   One change allows foreign graduates to take the samecertification test that U.S. medical school graduates take,rather than a different test for foreigners only. &quot;We arehappy that the same exams are given,&quot; says Dr. Shah, anIndia-educated urologist who practices in Maryland. &quot;Untilnow, they always labeled us as second-rate because we took adifferent exam. We want the same paper.&quot; Other steps to maketesting more uniform are in the works.   The International Association of American Physicians, anumbrella group that includes the Islamic Medical Association,the Association of Philippine Physicians in America and otherorganizations of foreign medical graduates here, also ispressing Congress to pass laws that would prohibit statelicensing boards from discriminating against doctors educatedabroad. Several anti-discrimination bills calling for federalmonitoring of state licensing practices have been introduced.   The American Medical Association concedes that someforeign graduates &quot;have been subject to requirementsdifferent from other physicians&quot; and opposes suchdiscrimination. But the AMA, worried about growing federalcontrol over medicine, has testified against bills that wouldgive the federal government a stronger role in licensing.Instead, the AMA is starting its own service for collectingand verifying physicians' credentials as a way to helpforeign graduates deal with requests from state licensingboards.   Officials at the state boards deny that their rules aredesigned to keep foreign doctors out. But &quot;there are a fewextra hoops (foreign graduates) have to go through,&quot; saysKathryn Hill, assistant executive vice president of theFederation of State Medical Boards in Fort Worth, Texas.   Before they can practice in the U.S., foreign medicalgraduates must pass a rigorous series of tests. First theymust show proficiency in English and a command of basicmedicine. The tests aren't easy. Of the 13,000 to 15,000foreign graduates who take the tests each year, about 60%pass the English test and about 25% pass the basic medicalscience test, according to the Educational Commission ofForeign Medical Graduates, the Philadelphia organization thatadministers the tests.   After passing these tests, foreign graduates must completeone to three years of training in a residency program in aU.S. hospital and pass a nationwide exam before beinglicensed to practice by various state medical boards. About81% of the foreign graduates who took the test for the firsttime in June passed.   Despite progress in eliminating differences between thetests that foreign and U.S. medical school graduates take,discrimination still exists, contend foreign graduates, whoregard some requirements as unnecessary. &quot;Medical school isonly part of what makes a complete doctor,&quot; says NeopitoRobles, an Arizona surgeon from the Philippines. &quot;Part istraining, and part is experience.&quot;   Part of that experience, too, is learning about theAmerican political system. Some members of Congress who haveintroduced bills to help foreign doctors have made it clearthat they expect something in return. Rep. Stephen Solarz(D., N.Y.), a sponsor of one of the bills, recently sent aletter to doctors asking them to contribute to the SolarzCongressional Club &quot;to provide much needed help for myre-election and to assist candidates who support us in ourefforts to help (foreign graduates).&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
