As previously reported, RepublicBank plans to acquire InterFirst Corp., its crosstown rival, and said the new financing would be completed before the acquisition.    RepublicBank initially proposed issuing $75 million of the new notes and $125 million in adjustable-rate preferred stock. But a spokesman said the bank holding company increased the debt offering because of favorable response to the issue and now plans to sell only $100 million of preferred stock.    Proceeds from the debt offering will be used for general purposes, including reducing other funding sources and extending credit to or funding investments in subsidiaries.    Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. is the underwriter.    The notes are convertible until June 1, 1999, into RepublicBank common stock at $30.50 a share. They cannot be redeemed before June 1, 1990.    RepublicBank shares closed at $24, unchanged, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday. </TEXT></DOC>
