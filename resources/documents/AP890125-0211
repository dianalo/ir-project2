Councilman Nate Holden, a mayoral candidate, displayed the blackUzi rifle at a news conference where police Cmdr. William Boothoutlined procedures for safely bringing weapons to police stations.   Holden offered on Tuesday to pay up to $300 for semiautomaticrifles and that night received a response, he said. A woman who keptthe Uzi under her bed for several years turned it in to ``get it outof her life,'' he said.   A 16-year-old boy brought the unloaded AK-47 to a police stationWednesday, saying he received it as a gift and ``just wanted to berid of it,'' said spokesman Lt. Fred Nixon.   An AK-47 was used last week by 24-year-old drifter Patrick Purdyto fire more than 100 bullets into a schoolyard in the San JoaquinValley city of Stockton, killing five students, wounding 29 studentsand one adult.   The attack by Purdy, who killed himself, produced calls fromstate and local officials for bans or restrictions on military-styleassault rifles, which can be bought in California more easily thanhandguns.   Booth said others who want to take Holden up on his offer to buythe guns should take them to a police station, notifying the stationin advance and carefully storing the gun in the trunk of the car,empty of bullets and disassembled.   ``These weapons were manufactured to kill people. ... That kindof weapon has no place in a civil society,'' Booth said.   Police will issue a receipt the person can take to Holden'soffice. Holden, who is running for re-election in April, said hewould pay up to $300 for each gun, depending on its value, and had$50,000 in a campaign committee fund for the effort.   Police said that any weapons turned in would be investigated, andnoted that possession of a gun that had been converted into a fullyautomatic weapon is illegal. But Holden said parents, friends andrelatives of gun owners, particularly gang members, should welcomethe chance to get rid of the powerful and deadly weapons.   The weapon displayed by Holden and Booth came in a canvas gun bagwith a document that identified it as an Uzi Model B, and producedby Israel Military Industries.   A resolution calling for legislation to ban the sale of militaryassault rifles in California was approved by the county Board ofSupervisors on Tuesday. The action was spurred by the Jan. 17shooting deaths of five children in a schoolyard in Stockton, innorthern California. Twenty-nine other students and one teacher werewounded. The gunman then killed himself.   ``It's important that we send a message to Sacramento that peoplehere are concerned about this,'' Ed Edelman, chairman of thefive-member board, said Tuesday.   Sheriff Sherman Block told the supervisors that he was meetingwith other law enforcement officials Friday to draft legislationbanning future sales of the AK-47 assault rifle and othermilitary-style weapons.   The proposed bill also would include a provision allowing judgesto increase a sentence by five years for felons convicted of usingsuch weapons in a crime.   In addition to Block's suggestions, Los Angeles City Police ChiefDaryl Gates wants to require a 15-day waiting period to buy any gunto allow law enforcement officials to check the buyer's record, apolice spokesman said.</TEXT></DOC>
