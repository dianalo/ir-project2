The announcement said Coastal signed an agreement Tuesday withChina National Chemicals Import-Export Corp., also known asSinochem, in which Sinochem will acquire a 50 percent interest inthe joint-venture company for an undisclosed amount of cash.   Other Chinese companies and investors have interests in Americanreal estate, but none have bought an interest in oil properties,said Frank Knuettel, an oil analyst with Prudential-BacheSecurities Inc.   Alicia M. Quijano with the U.S. Commerce Department declined tocomment on whether Sinochem was indeed the first company from acommunist country to buy into an American energy company.   David Fleischer, who follows the refinery industry forPrudential-Bache, said he suspected Coastal would not disclose thepurchase amount because it is still negotiating to sell otherrefining ventures. Most of those negotiations, he said, are withMiddle Eastern countries.   In a July 29 report, Fleischer said that a sale of a one-halfinterest in the company's refining assets would likely bring over$700 million in cash. Fleischer said Wednesday that the newlyannounced agreement would probably amount to less than 20 percentof that total.   Fleischer also estimated the joint venture would release workingcapital of $40 million to $50 million to Coastal.   Jim Bailey, a spokesman for Coastal, said the money from thesale has not been earmarked and would not comment on whether theproceeds would go toward Coastal's goal of paying off debtresulting from its 1985 acquisition of American Natural Resources.   Coastal has been saying for some time that it wanted to sellhalf of its refining interests because of the volatility of theindustry.   ``But foreign countries are interested in buying refineries inthe United States and having the final destination of where theproduct goes,'' Fleischer said.   Coastal operations to be assigned to the joint venture include arefinery at Hercules, Calif.; fuel oil terminals at Los Angeles andCoos Bay, Ore.; and marketing operations at San Francisco, SanPedro and Long Beach, Calif., and Portland, Ore.   ``We are enthusiastic about this new joint venture, which willstrengthen the tradition of excellent relations between our companyand Sinochem, started in 1978 when Coastal became the firstAmerican company to purchase and import crude from the People'sRepublic of China,'' said Oscar S. Wyatt Jr., Coastal's chairmanand chief executive officer.   The joint venture may be the start of a trend for American oilcompanies to sell their interests to foreign countries.   ``You'll see more refinery assets being sold and most buyerswill be foreign countries,'' Fleischer said.   The Hercules refinery, operated by Pacific Refining Co., aCoastal subsidiary, has a refining capacity of 55,000 barrels perday and storage for 2.2 million barrels. The terminals operated byWestern Fuel Oil Co., another Coastal subsidiary, have a combinedcapacity of 1.4 million barrels of refined petroleum products.   The memorandum agreement includes plans for capital expendituresto upgrade the Hercules refinery for expanded production of higheroctane gasolines and other transportation fuels. A crude oil supplyagreement also will be negotiated between Sinochem and the jointventure company.   ``We are pleased with this opportunty to expand our finebusiness relationship with Coastal through our investment andparticipation in this new joint-venture company,'' said ZhengDunxun, chief executive officer and president of Sinochem.   ``This agreement is also another step forward in Sinochem'scontinuing efforts to diversify and strengthen its oil markets andto expand its worldwide operations.''   Sinochem is a state-owned, international diversified businesscorporation of the People's Republic of China in Beijing.   Houston-based Coastal is a diversified energy company with totalassets of $8 billion and operations in natural gas pipelines, oiland gas exploration and production, refining and marketing, coaland trucking.</TEXT></DOC>
