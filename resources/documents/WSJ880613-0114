The endorsement is one of many preliminary recommendations that are expected to be sent to the White House in a report later this month. It underscores earlier endorsements by the American Red Cross and other medical groups, and is good news for companies involved in the small but fast-growing market for autotransfusion equipment.    Auto-transfusion techniques have existed for decades, but before the acquired immune deficiency syndrome crisis, were mainly used only in special cases, such as patients with rare blood types. There are two main techniques -- collection and storage of blood over several weeks prior to elective surgeries, and continuous recycling of blood when patients are on the operating table. A third technique involves drawing blood from patients just before surgery, then diluting and reinfusing it after surgery.    The technology for recycling blood during operations was developed in the 1950s, but wasn't widely used until the 1970s, when Haemonetics Corp., a closely held Braintree, Mass.-based concern that is 47%-owned by Du Pont Co., improved the technology. The machines spin blood in centrifuges to remove impurities, such as bone chips, and then put it back in the patient. During an organ transplant, a patient's entire blood content may pass through a machine several times, says John White, president of Haemonetics.    The machines -- priced between $15,000 and $35,000 -- were once used mainly during heart surgery, but now the largest market is in orthopedic surgery, says Gary Webb, national sales manager for Electromedics Inc., an Englewood, Colo.-based maker of auto-transfusion equipment. The company's sales, about one-half of which are generated by the equipment, are expected to increase this year about 24% to $23 million, he adds.    Other makers of the equipment are Kardiothor Inc., a unit of Woodlands, Texas-based Amnion Inc., and Shiley Inc., a unit of New York-based Pfizer Inc.    A spokesman for the Red Cross says that between 1985 and 1987, the amount of blood collected from auto-transfusions by the organization tripled, though it still comprises less than 1% of blood handled. There's plenty of room for further growth: An estimated 10% to 14% of hospital patients needing blood are candidates for auto-transfusion, says Lawrence T. Goodnough, a transfusion specialist at University Hospitals of Cleveland. Those not considered eligible include patients with cancer or infections, diseases that may be worsened by reinfusing a patient's blood.    Typically, patients undergoing elective surgery can pre-deposit blood at intervals of several days during the month before their operations, while taking iron pills to prevent anemia. &quot;Most patients can donate four units of blood in three weeks,&quot; which is enough for transfusions involved in major surgery, says Charles Huggins, director of transfusion services at Boston's Massachusetts General Hospital.    AIDS isn't the main risk from transfusions, but &quot;it brought into focus that transfusions are not without risk,&quot; says Dr. Goodnough. He adds that the risk of getting AIDS from a transfusion is perhaps 1 in 100,000, though estimates by researchers vary significantly. A greater problem, he says, is the risk of contracting non-A, non-B hepatitis -- an occasionally fatal disease that killed entertainer Danny Kaye last year after he received a transfusion.    &quot;The blood supply is safer than it has ever been,&quot; says Dr. Huggins. &quot;But the risk of dying from AIDS or hepatitis after a transfusion is significantly greater than a person's chance of winning the Massachusetts' Megabucks lottery with a $1 ticket.&quot; He adds that some of the hospital's out-of-town patients recently arrived carrying ice chests packed with their blood. </TEXT></DOC>
