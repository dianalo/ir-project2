That's the question some in Congress are asking. DirectorWilliam Webster was scheduled to testify last Friday aboutthe Soviet Union in an open Senate hearing. But on Thursdaythe office of Armed Services Chairman Sam Nunn received amessage from the CIA requesting that his hearing beclassified.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We wanted it to be open,&quot; says one committee staffmember. &quot;We acceded to their request to do it closed.&quot;   What's the big secret? A year ago Judge Webster testifiedin the bright sunshine. He made headlines when he concludedthat Mikhail Gorbachev &quot;is committed to implementing asweeping decentralization and liberalization of the Sovietsystem. A major reversal of his policies could only come withhis removal.&quot; Washington declared the end of Leninisthistory.   Whoops. That sweeping optimism looks pale now that BlackBerets have stormed Vilnius and Eduard Shevardnadze haspredicted &quot;dictatorship.&quot; Gorby is still around, butliberalization is not. Could it be that the CIA has changedits mind? If it has, why shouldn't the U.S. public know aboutit?   In fact, a draft of Judge Webster's testimony wascirculating inside the Bush administration late last weekbefore the squeamish slapped &quot;secret&quot; on it. The CIA, proddedby the Armed Services Committee, is now scrambling to write asanitized version for release later this week. But the draftoffers the most glum administration assessment yet ofMoscow's Nobel Peace Prize winner. Its main judgments:   -- It isn't clear that Mr. Gorbachev is still in charge.&quot;The authority of the central government has declineddramatically,&quot; says the draft. &quot;Gorbachev has lost much ofhis political support, and with it, the ability to controlthe course of events.&quot;   -- His residual support comes from the neo-Stalinists.&quot;Gorbachev now relies heavily on the Communist Party, theKGB, and the military-institutions that are comfortable withthe coercive methods used to enforce law and order.&quot; The morehe depends on them, &quot;the more vulnerable he becomes to thosesame institutions.&quot;   -- One silver lining is that the neo-Stalinists aren'tcertain to prevail over what the draft calls &quot;the forces ofreform, led by Boris Yeltsin.&quot; These forces are &quot;resistingGorbachev's policies. They strongly condemn the government'suse of force in the Baltics and are pressing for a moreconfederal union and a market economy.&quot; This is the closestany U.S. official has come to saying anything nice about Mr.Yeltsin, the Russian Republican who last week called on Mr.Gorbachev to resign for bringing the country &quot;dictatorship.&quot;   -- The cause of the reformers has broad popular support.&quot;The Communist Party and system are despised and largelydiscredited. Political turmoil has probably weakened theSoviet military to the point that it might not be a reliabletool to suppress widespread unrest,&quot; Mr. Webster's draftsays. &quot;There is tremendous support within the Soviet Unionfor greater political and economic independence.&quot;   This contradicts American Gorbapologists who say the onlyalternative to their man is neo-Stalinism. It alsocomplicates life for President Bush. Mr. Yeltsin's people areputting out the word that he'd like to visit the U.S. inApril, but won't without an assurance that he can meet Mr.Bush. The president will make such a gesture if he wants toassist Soviet reform.   In any event, says the CIA, &quot;the more widespread therepression, the greater the potential for massive civilunrest and even for civil war.&quot; The Soviet economy is &quot;in adepression&quot; and will only get worse. Soviet GNP fell lastyear by &quot;at least 5% and inflation now exceeds 40% and isaccelerating. Shortages abound and oil production isdropping.&quot; Mr. Gorbachev, the fence-sitter, has no adequateanswer for these woes.   As grim as this all is, the CIA isn't announcing the startof Cold War II. It's more like The Dying Empire Strikes Back.Judge Webster's testimony makes clear that the Sovietpolitical and economic crisis is putting pressure on themilitary. &quot;The military readiness of Soviet conventionalforces is at a low point,&quot; the CIA draft says. &quot;The WarsawPact has collapsed,&quot; military recruiting is complicated byinternal unrest, and weapons production is expected to fallin the next decade.   Yet the military continues to soak up an inordinate shareof ever more scarce Soviet resources. Navy spending has beencut &quot;only marginally,&quot; and &quot;the Soviets are in the midst ofan important new program to modernize their strategicweapons.&quot; The ominous reason: &quot;The Soviets link their statusas a superpower to strong strategic forces,&quot; arms controlnotwithstanding.   The ability of the Soviets &quot;to launch a strongpremeditated attack against the West will remain low over thenext five years,&quot; the CIA draft says. &quot;But we temper thisjudgment with full knowledge that Soviet forces remainpowerful and will be subject to a political leadership underpressure.&quot; In other words, beware of the wounded bear's lastcharge.   Some Americans -- at the State Department, for example --think Mr. Gorbachev's internal troubles won't change hisforeign policy. But the CIA disagrees. &quot;Gorbachev's move tothe right is already apparent in foreign policy,&quot; thetestimony says, and &quot;hardline critics&quot; are &quot;pressing for atougher policy toward the West.&quot; Mr. Gorbachev won't go intofull retreat from Western cooperation, Judge Websterpredicts, but look for foot-dragging on armscontrol, renewedarms sales to the Third World &quot;for hard currency,&quot; and morescheming like last week's Gulf gambit.   Why wasn't Mr. Webster allowed to say all this in public?One source familiar with CIA thinking says the decision wasMr. Webster's. &quot;In their final review, the determination wasmade that it was too provocative to come out with such apessimistic assessment of the Soviet Union,&quot; says thissource. &quot;It might appear we were giving up on Gorbachev.&quot;Others suspect that someone else, in the White House or atState, ordered the CIA to clam up, for similar reasons.   Certainly, many in the administration think the CIA is toopessimistic now, partly to compensate for its too-rosyscenario last year. At State, in particular, the view is thatMr. Gorbachev is &quot;almost Hamlet&quot; in his indecision. Heclearly has a vision of a vastly different Soviet Union, theybelieve, but is frightened by the forces of reform he'sunleashed. So the U.S. wants to continue to work with him,though it will &quot;test him&quot; on foreign policy and expand tiesto the republics and reformers.   That may be this year's too-rosy scenario. If the CIA iscorrect now, then Mr. Gorbachev is more figurehead thanreformer. This vindicates those, like Dick Cheney and DanQuayle, who have been skeptical all along. Gorbaphiles arguethat saving their man is better than the alternative. But ifhe's already fronting for the alternative, what's there tosave? With Interior Minister Boris Pugo in charge, at leastwe'd have truth in advertising.   ---   Mr. Gigot writes the column &quot;Potomac Watch&quot; fromWashington.</TEXT></DOC>
