Corresponding threshold conditions, temporalgrowth rates, the structure and domain of localization of unstable modesare obtained. It is shown that at the linear stage of instability compressionof localization domain of unstable modes takes place. This should resultin fast dissipation of HF energy in the resonance region. By optimalchoice of lower-hybrid wave power and other parameters these processeswill result in the heating of a central region of plasma filament intokamaks. 30 res.; 1 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
