Experience seems to have won the day on jobs programs.Except for what passes as &quot;workfare,&quot; none are likely to gofar in Congress. But skepticism about no-jobs programs hasbeen slower to spread from economists to media andpoliticians.</LP><TEXT>   The result is a big push for expanded unemploymentpayments as the jobless rate rises. A lot of people arehurting in the recession, and tales of individual hardshipaggravated by arbitrary denials make good copy -- but usuallynot good policy. The same could be said of stories (just asnumerous, if untold) of claimants and companies abusing thesystem. Better that lawmakers concentrate on getting theincentives right for people to find work and for employers tooffer it.   Big Labor's lobby wants to make it easier to extendbenefits beyond the standard 26-week duration. That wouldreverse the trend of the past dozen years, as would a relatedeffort to relax eligibility rules. The question is, doeskindness kill jobs?   Unemployment programs were set up as a federal-statescheme in the mid-1930s. The federal tax burden has been onlytwo or three pennies per $10 of wages paid, but the averagestate burden started out at 10 times that. State tax ratesbasically rise or fall with the jobless index, but theygradually weighed lighter on the economy from World War IIthrough Vietnam before becoming ponderous again in the late1970s. That prompted an enforced diet, and by 1990, thanksalso to prosperous times, the federal and state tax take of$21.3 billion amounted to $202 per covered worker, the lowestsince the early '70s. Going into the current slump, theburden of the state taxes -- a mean seven cents per $10 ofwages -- was half what it was in 1979.   Though the program has cinched its macroeconomic belt, itcontinues to encourage microeconomic flab. The states setbenefit levels, critical incentives to work or not work. A&quot;replacement rate&quot; of half the previous wage is a traditionaltarget. But Bruce Meyer of Northwestern University, one ofthe nation's rising young economists in the field, estimatesthat having the rate at 50% instead of 40% lengthens idlenessby perhaps 1 1/2 weeks. Martin Feldstein illustrated in themid-1970s how in a high-benefit state such as Massachusetts(which still tops the nation) a typical jobless worker wouldlose only 12.8% of income.   Extending the duration of benefits, whatever their level,might only further delay the inevitable. Mr. Meyer calculatesthat the unemployed are two to three times more likely toreturn to the work force in their last week of eligibilitythan in any previous week. And a longer search doesn't seemto lead to much better pay. The engineer who won't move hisfamily may yet have to take work at the hardware store.   Rep. Tom Downey (D., N.Y.), prominent on the issue, usedthe occasion of last week's higher jobless numbers toannounce a bid to revamp the federal-state system to enhanceWashington's role and its tax take. He would cut the federalunemployment tax rate by more than half but expand itstaxable wage base to $55,800. That would collect an estimated$27.1 billion extra from employers over 1992-96.   Economist Meyer has some sympathy for this thrust.Broadening the tax base probably means less burden onlow-paid, entry jobs -- so fewer of them will be squeezed outof existence -- and more on the middle-income occupations,the biggest users of the program. And, despite his evidencethat the clock is an inducement to job acceptance, hebelieves an emphasis on longer-term beneficiaries couldbetter direct the program to those it was intended to help:dislocated workers rather than employees (and employers) whouse unemployment insurance as a waiting room betweenintermittent work for the same company.   Indeed, a four-state study showed that 42.2% of thosecollecting benefits were recalled to their previous jobs.This happens frequently in construction, mining andmanufacturing. The employer is able to tap into a surpluslabor pool and stick others with the cost. Althoughunemployment taxes are normally &quot;experience-rated,&quot; meaningthat a company with frequent layoffs pays more, most statesputs caps on the ratings, beyond which the employer paysnothing for incremental pink slips. The aided concerns are anorganized lobby for the caps. In Puerto Rico, no experiencerating exists at all -- and the tax burden is the worst inthe nation.   The University of Chicago's Robert Topel found using1977-81 data that a third to a half of all unemployment&quot;spells&quot; could be ascribed to inducements of the benefitsystem, either to employees or employers. Minor adjustmentsto enhance its economic efficiency have been made since. Morecould be, without spending billions as Mr. Downey wants. Butunemployment on the cheap may not be the best aim if itmerely shifts recipients to other doles and doesn't encouragethem to return to productive work.   Parsimony does have its place. Restraint in job-reliefpayments during the 1980s cushioned rapid increases in otherlabor costs, such as health benefits and workers' comp.Otherwise, the American economic employment engine easilycould have stalled. Contrast the U.S. experience with Canada,which didn't tighten benefit strictures. Before 1982, the twocountries had similar jobless rates, but even as Canada'seconomy outpaced the U.S. for much of the decade, itsunemployment drag increased. Now, with both countries inrecession, official Canadian joblessness is nearly 60%higher.   With jobless benefits as with so much else, the U.S. founditself more than a decade ago at the apex of publicgenerosity and teetering for a fall. The new world economywas for the quick -- and the well-trained, literate andself-disciplined. Those left behind today might be succoredby a return to easy unemployment, but the support would stillbe temporary. This programmatic vestige of the Depression, ata high cost or low, doesn't work well.   What humane policy might? The Dallas-based National Centerfor Policy Analysis asks us to consider the concept oftax-deductible individual accounts for unemployment relief.Just as for retirement, medical care and other forms ofsocial insurance, an IRA type of program would go a long wayto getting the incentives right.   Workers could be told to set aside approximately theamount their employers must now cough up for them, and couldbegin drawing on that sum whenever unemployed or training fornew work. There need be no processing delays, as at present.They could remain jobless for as long as they thoughtappropriate, mindful they were depleting an account thatwould otherwise be theirs at some later date. After taxwrite-offs, the public price tag might actually be higherthan for what we have now, but the payoff would merit it.   Obviously, the notion would need refining. But it's morepromising than a headlong rush back to the silly '70s. Letthis flower bloom in recession, too.</TEXT></DOC>
