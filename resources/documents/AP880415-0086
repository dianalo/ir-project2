It said she wrote afinal testament requesting a white casket with gold lettering forher burial.   Her doctor later determined the test was faulty and she didn'thave AIDS, the paper said.   Another woman was ready to poison herself because an AIDS testhad indicated her husband carried the deadly virus, the newspapersaid. Three days later the doctor said the diagnosis was wrong.   On Tuesday, the Bavaria state Parliament AIDS committee said upto 30 percent of AIDS test results in West Germany are incorrect.   ``There are rheumatism-related illnesses that, at first glance,react the same as AIDS antibodies,'' committee member and stateparliamentary deputy Karl Heinz Mueller told reporters.   The committee based its report on recent AIDS test results in asection of Bavaria state, where 528 of 11,824 patients tested asAIDS-positive.   In a second round of testing to confirm results, only 359 of the528 again tested positive, Mueller said.   About 500 West Germans a day are tested for the AIDS virus, theAbendpost newspaper said.   The committee said it was shocked about the results and calledfor uniform procedures in testing and informing patients.   Social workers Wednesday supported the committee's appeal. Theyalso criticized doctors who prematurely or without psychologicalconsiderations inform patients they have the virus.   ``It's pure terror. One can only do that if one wants toencourage suicide,'' Eberhard Zastrau of the Deutsche Aids-Hilfe(German AIDS Help) self-help group told The Associated Press inMunich.   The committee also said Bavaria state should end its policy oftesting civil service applicants, foreigners applying for asylumand young men in military service.   Bavaria state in 1987 introduced tough measures aimed atpreventing the spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome,including mandatory testing of those groups.   AIDS is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system,leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer.   It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles orsyringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products,and from pregnant women to their offspring.</TEXT></DOC>
