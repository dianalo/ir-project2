The spokesman said the policy, which he called&quot;unprecedented,&quot; was decided after Egyptian President HosniMubarak asked visiting Japanese Foreign Minister TaroNakayama to help Cairo offset foreign-exchange losses thateventually could total $2 billion a year. Mr. Nakayama is ona tour of several nations in the region.</LP><TEXT>   In addition to Egypt, Turkey and Jordan probably would beeligible for aid, the spokesman said. Last week, Iran askedJapan for $1.5 billion in fresh loans, but that requestwasn't directly tied to the crisis in the Gulf.   New money to countries in the region would take the formof both grants and loans, the Foreign Ministry official said.   In addition to its pledge to provide financial aid, Japanyesterday said it would dispatch medical and communicationsequipment to Gulf countries hurt by the confrontation withIraq.   Japan, the world's second-largest importer of oil, hasbeen agonizing over how to respond to the Aug. 2 Iraqiinvasion of Kuwait. Although it joined in the internationalboycott of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil and froze Kuwait's financialassets in Japan, the government considers itselfconstitutionally barred from providing military assistance inthe region. Under the country's constitution, drafted by theoccupied Allied forces after World War II, Japan is preventedfrom maintaining a military except for its own defense.   Over the past several weeks, some officials have said theymight consider revisions in the country's laws to providesome kind of support to the multinational force in the Gulf.But the country's political opposition, led by the JapanSocialist Party, vehemently opposes such a move.</TEXT></DOC>
