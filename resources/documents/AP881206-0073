A triple cordon of police officers guarded the doors of theParliament building as about 3,000 shoe workers, mostly female,chanted: ``You are afraid of women, shame on you!'' and ``Thieves,Thieves!''   At the Labin coal pits, 148 miles southwest of Zagreb, about1,000 miners stopped working Monday to demand payment of a bonus forhaving fulfilled the annual production quota one month ahead ofschedule, Belgrade newspapers reported.   Also Monday, several hundred workers at the Bor copper mines,about 90 miles southwest of Belgrade, staged a brief work stoppagefor the same reason as the Labin miners, newspapers reported.   More than 3,000 employees of a fertilizer factory in Sabac, about50 miles west of Belgrade, staged a street protest Monday, accusingmunicipal Communist Party leaders of inefficiency and dishonesty. Asa result of the protest, the entire municipal leadership wasreplaced, press reports said.   In Belgrade, a total of about 7,000 shoe workers went on striketoday.   About 3,000 of them marched almost 3 miles in the rain to reachthe Parliament building, chanting anti-government slogans anddemanding salary raises.   ``We want proper wages, don't torment us!'' the crowd chanted,pressing against the police cordon. After several hours, the workerswere allowed to enter Parliament, where they spoke with partyofficials.   ``I can't feed myself and my children with $45 a month,''Gvozdenka Pavlovic said. The average Yugoslav salary is about $100 amonth.   The demonstrators dispersed peacefully after Serbian CommunistParty leader Slobodoan Milosevic promised he would visit theirfactory.   Yugoslavia is facing increasing social and labor unrest as aresult of the worst economic crisis in the country's postwarhistory, including a 236 percent annual inflation rate and a $21billion foreign debt.   According to official figures, workers' buying power has declinedby 25 percent since the beginning of this year and living standardshave dropped to 1960s levels.   In the past 10 months, there have been more than 1,000 strikes,many of them involving street demonstrations, the government said.   Official Belgrade trade unions today called on citizens to refuseto pay electricity bills if the latest 31 percent price raise wasnot canceled.   News reports said about one-fourth of Belgrade's 2 million peoplehave been unable to pay their electricity, water and heating bills.According to the reports, power companies have begun cutting offsupplies in an effort to force people to pay.   State-run newspapers said railroad workers in the capital saidthey would stage a strike Wednesday if their salaries were notraised by 50 percent. The strike would paralyze all rail trafficcoming in and going out of the capital.</TEXT></DOC>
