Botha practicedfinger-wagging, confrontational politics for more than 50 years, andultimately it cost him the support of even his staunchest allies inthe ruling National Party.   Nicknamed the ``Great Crocodile'' for his feared temper andsometimes ruthless manner, Botha has served as head of governmentfor 11 rocky years.   ``He has a gift for making enemies as other men have a gift forfriendship,'' newspaper editor Ken Owen once wrote.   Botha liked to depict himself as the first South African leaderto pursue race reform, but he tenaciously defended the framework ofapartheid while leading South Africa through its worst racialviolence and deepest international isolation.   Botha's foremost loyalties were to his fellow Afrikaners, yet hismoves to extend limited political power to non-whites split thewhite tribe, prompting a mass defection of hard-line segregationistsfrom the National Party in 1982.   Within the anti-apartheid movement, Botha was reviled but rarelyunderestimated. As prime minister and later as president, hisunpredictable blend of reform and repression kept militant activistsoff balance and enabled his government to maintain political andmilitary dominance despite sanctions, unrest and guerrilla attacks.   Botha was in unquestioned control of the government until hesuffered a stroke Jan. 18.   A week later, while still recuperating, he resigned as leader ofthe National Party and was replaced by Education Minister F.W. deKlerk, a man Botha did not support.   Botha, 73, appears to have recovered from his stroke, but notfrom his loss of political control.   He wanted to stay on as president, ostensibly above partypolitics, but the National Party caucus made it clear in March itpreferred that he step down immediately. He went on nationaltelevision to reject the suggestion, but was forced to agree toretirement after the Sept. 6 parliamentary elections.   His bitterness became more obvious as he abruptly refused toattend a farewell banquet held in his honor by the party he hadserved for 54 years. Then he appeared unannounced at a provincialparty congress, requiring de Klerk to give up his seat at the headtable.   His meeting with imprisoned African National Congress leaderNelson Mandela was praised, but it added to the growing impressionthat he was capable of any unpredictable act to embarrass de Klerk.   Botha found it necessary to announce: ``I am not a sulking oldman.''   But with less than a month to go before the crucial elections,Botha provoked another public confrontation, apparentlyunderestimating the support de Klerk enjoyed from the entire Cabinet.   Botha said Friday he had not been properly informed of a plannedAug. 28 trip to Zambia by de Klerk and Foreign Minister Pik Botha.The meeting is an opening to black Africa that Botha had worked hardto accomplish, and he had hoped to be the one making the trip.   His decision to make public a dispute about a procedural pointnot only embarrassed his party, but was seen as an unwarrantedattack on the veracity of the foreign minister. Pik Botha, norelation to the president, had served him loyally for 11 years andis credited with swinging his own supporters to P.W. Botha in thetight battle for the prime ministership in 1978.   Born Jan. 12, 1916, the son of a farmer in the rural Orange FreeState province, Botha never served in the military or graduated fromcollege. He quit university in 1935 to become a National Partyorganizer.   During World War II, Botha joined the Ossewabrandwag (Ox WagonFire Guard), a group that was sympathetic to the Nazis and opposedSouth Africa's participation on the Allied side.   Botha won election to Parliament in 1948, the year the NationalParty came to power and began codifying apartheid legislation. Hejoined the Cabinet in 1961 and was named defense minister in 1966.   He became head of the white-minority government Sept. 28, 1978,and repeatedly stressed the paramount importance of nationalsecurity in the face of what he called a communist-led ''totalonslaught.''   In 1984, Botha helped push through a new constitution thatbrought Asians and people of mixed-race into the previouslyall-white Parliament, but continued to exclude the 28-million blackmajority.   The constitution also changed Botha's title from prime ministerto president, with drastically increased powers. He used them todeclare a national emergency which, after three years, has stifledthe political violence that resulted from black anger over the newconstitution.   Botha was credited with repealing some of apartheid's mosthurtful laws, but he made clear he would never consider thepossibility of black-majority government. He also promised that aslong as he was president, whites would retain segregated schools andneighborhoods.   Critics on the left said Botha's reforms were merely cosmetic,while right-wing whites accused him of capitulating to blacks.</TEXT></DOC>
