Long-term Treasury issues gained slightly more than one-eighth of a point, or just over $1.25 for each $1,000 face amount. That followed sharp declines of about 2 1/2 points earlier this week.    Corporate bonds wound up little changed from Wednesday, while municipals finished with mixed results. The credit markets developed a case of &quot;the summer blahs,&quot; said Richard S. Wilson, vice president for corporate bond research at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.    Despite yesterday's slight improvement, many traders remain apprehensive about the interest rate outlook for the next few weeks because of the Treasury's borrowing needs. Concern about government borrowing is especially deep because Congress still hasn't raised the nation's borrowing limit. Once Congress finally acts, the Treasury will be forced to hold several large securities sales at unusually close intervals.    Even looking beyond the Treasury borrowings, some investment managers contend that interest rates aren't likely to drop much further and could rise significantly. They are concerned about the nation's slow progress in paring its trade deficit, and some also fear that a recent surge in raw industrial commodity prices represents a strong signal that inflation is accelerating.    &quot;I think it is more likely that rates will go up than go down&quot; in the next year or two, said Ernest Stern, senior vice president for finance of the World Bank. &quot;How much rates could go down is somewhat limited, and how much they could go up is quite considerable.&quot;    The World Bank is one of the largest players in the U.S. Treasury securities markets. Its portfolio of liquid investments, which Mr. Stern refers to as &quot;our petty cash account,&quot; totals roughly $19 billion. The bank is planning to start using futures and options on debt securities sometime this fall.    Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds rose 1.92 points yesterday to 1273.23. The index ranged between 1267.80 and 1274.92.    The most actively traded long-term issue, the Treasury's 8 3/4% bonds due 2017, rose to 99 22/32 from 99 17/32 Wednesday. The yield fell to 8.78% from 8.79%. The government's 8 1/2% notes due 1997 advanced to 99 27/32 from 99 22/32, as the yield declined to 8.52% from 8.54%.    Among shorter-term issues, the government's 7 7/8% notes due May 1990 rose to 100 13/32 from 100 11/32, while the yield declined to 7.70% from 7.73%.    The federal funds rate rose slightly yesterday, averaging 6.60%, according to an estimate by Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.) Inc. The funds rate, which is the rate on reserves that banks lend each other overnight, has averaged about 6 1/2% in the previous seven trading days.    Rates also rose on short-term Treasury bills. The rate on the latest three-month Treasury bill increased slightly to 5.65% bid from 5.64% Wednesday. The latest six-month bill rate climbed to 5.87% bid from 5.81%.    In the municipal bond market, activity also was unusually quiet. Among new issues, Nassau County, N.Y., sold about $70.4 million of bonds in two separate issues. One totaled $47.9 million of general improvement bonds, and the other was $22.5 million of sewer district bonds.    J. Douglas Casey, a managing director of Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co., the sole underwriter, said both issues were priced after auction to yield from 4.3% on bonds due 1988 to as much as 7.5% on bonds due 2016. All the bonds are insured by Financial Guaranty Insurance Co. and are rated triple-A by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. Mr. Casey said the two issues were about 25% sold as of late yesterday. &quot;Just a really apathetic day&quot; in the bond markets, Mr. Casey added.    The Federal Reserve late yesterday reported an unexpectedly large $7.1 billion plunge in the nation's money supply, known as M1, in the week ended July 13. The M1 measure, which consists of checking deposits plus cash held by the public, fell to a seasonally adjusted average of $743.3 billion from $750.4 billion the previous week.    During the latest 13 weeks, M1 has averaged $750.7 billion, which represents an annual growth rate of 6.9% from the like period 13 weeks earlier. The large drop in M1 during the latest week had little effect on the credit markets because Fed officials have said they no longer consider M1 to be a reliable indicator of where inflation and the economy are heading. </TEXT></DOC>
