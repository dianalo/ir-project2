That's Sen. Lloyd Bentsen's joke, and it tells of thetransformation that accompanies a political honeymoon. PresidentBush is enjoying his, but he's been around _ he knows it won't last.   ``I don't expect it's all going to be sweetness and harmony andlight,'' he said. He addresses Congress one week from tonight,filling in blanks on his agenda, especially on the budget deficit.   ``The minute we get those proposals up there ... I expect we'regoing to have other firestorms swirling around,'' he said.   The big bills run up by the government during the Ronald Reaganera are coming due and there is no painless way to pay them.   That surely will lead to some partisan spats, but it doesn't meanthe honeymoon will be over. Presidential honeymoons with Congressusually last well into warm weather in Washington and end gradually,issue by issue.   Gerald R. Ford, the unelected president, was an exception. He hada month's harmony and then pardoned Richard M. Nixon for Watergate.   Not long ago there were suggestions that Bush wouldn't get ahoneymoon at all, not after the long, often negative presidentialcampaign. The Democrats surely wouldn't forget that. They did,almost immediately.   ``The change in George Bush is impressive,'' Bentsen, theDemocratic vice presidential nominee, said at a stag, black-tiedinner last Saturday night. ``This time last year he was beingcalled a wimp. Now he's so tough he gargles with water from BostonHarbor.'' Bush was there to laugh at the ribbing about his campaigntelevision commercial blaming Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis forpollution in Boston Harbor.   Bush said during the transition that campaign bitterness wouldn'tlast. ``Nobody remembers campaigns, ads about Willie Horton,'' hesaid then. ``The country's looking forward.''   But the early Bush honeymoon has been smoother than he could haveexpected. It has been a time harmony and calm, save for what Bushcalled a few ripples. One followed an administration suggestion thata fee on bank depositors might be the way to pay the price of thesavings and loan crisis. Another was stirred by conservativeRepublicans who questioned whether Bush's nominee to head theDepartment of Health and Human Services really opposes abortion. Hesaid he does.   Actually, the flap over fees for an Sandamp;L bailout could serve theadministration's interests. That unpopular idea was floated early inthe process; alternatives could look better by comparison. And theabortion controversy had more to do with conservative orthodoxy thanwith substance.   Cabinet confirmation proceedings in the Senate have produced moreDemocratic praise than pointed criticism. In the House, Speaker JimWright said he will not press Senate-approved legislation that wouldcompel presidents to advise Congress within 48 hours of covertintelligence operations, holding off on ``a mutual assumption ofgood faith'' with the new administration.   Of such assumptions are honeymoons made.   President Reagan's was different, since he held the politicalshotgun when he came to power in 1981. Republicans had captured theSenate and strengthened their House minority. Reagan was as powerfula campaigner in office as out. He got Congress to do his bidding bykeeping the pressure on.   Democrats kept pronouncing the Reagan honeymoon over, but he keptwinning. It was mid-summer when his tax cut bill came to a finalvote in the House, and the president won decisively after atelevised bid for support that swamped congressmen with telephonecalls and telegrams.   ``Never in my 30 years here have I see that kind of pressure,''said former Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr.   President Carter had a shaky honeymoon in unfamiliar territory.He was the outsider and he tended to handle Congress that way, eventhough it was dominated by fellow Democrats.   His first nominee to head the Central Intelligence Agency had towithdraw or risk rejection by a Democratic Senate.   His early travels and appointments were set without advance wordto Democrats from the state involved. He took on powerfulcongressional interests in an effort to cut back federal rivers andharbors projects and wound up with half the cut he sought, after along and politically costly battle.   While most of his major proposals were approved, it never was aneasy partnership.</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: Walter R.
