The Japanese threat might furrow the brows of many auto executives around the world but not the urbane chairman of Bayerische Motoren Werke AG. For 18 years, Mr. von Kuenheim, the longest serving chairman at a major auto producer, has seen rivals come and go. And for 18 years BMW has raced along in the fast lane. So what, he sniffs, if the Japanese begin offering a $35,000 car next year?    &quot;It takes several decades to build up an outstanding reputation,&quot; says the 59-year-old Mr. von Kuenheim in his suite atop the cylindrical BMW tower. &quot;You can't do it by simply designing a new product, asking a higher price and then saying, 'Now I, too, am at the top end.' It takes more. You must bring up the total corporate identity. That takes a long, long time.&quot;    Mr. von Kuenheim's confidence is born of success. After several sluggish years, BMW is showing its old zip, thanks especially to its new 500- and 700-series cars. The auto maker expects to sell the most cars in its history this year, some 490,000 of them and a healthy 7% gain from 1987. That is in contrast to lower unit sales by many luxurycar competitors, notably archrival Daimler-Benz AG.    Yet once the Japanese join the fray, skeptics doubt BMW can maintain its highflying position. &quot;They've demonstrated an ability to come roaring back,&quot; says Mark Snowdon, auto-industry consultant at Booz Allen andamp; Hamilton in Paris, &quot;but it's going to be tough for them to stay ahead.&quot;    BMW should have a smooth ride until its next big challenge: the model changeover in the less-expensive 300 series, expected in 1990. It will be more difficult to achieve the same success that BMW has had with the other two models, Mr. Snowdon reasons, because there is more competition and the market itself is more diffuse. Moreover, this market accounts for nearly 70% of BMW's output. &quot;A slip-up there and they could be in big trouble,&quot; he asserts.    In discussing BMW's strategy for staying out in front, Mr. von Kuenheim says simply that the goal is &quot;to be better,&quot; to build better cars. But in the luxury-auto business, being better means being at the leading edge of automotive technology and in this respect, BMW may soon embark on a radical new path: diversification.    Since its founding in 1916, BMW has produced cars and motorcycles -- and nothing else. While auto makers world-wide have been dashing about buying up all sorts of non-auto assets, BMW has stuck to its knitting. The reason for its hesitance is apparent in Mr. von Kuenheim's own ambivalence toward diversification.    &quot;We have only one product, the motor car,&quot; he says. &quot;Only with the motor car can you make such a high volume of sales. There's no other product in the world.&quot;    Still, BMW is prepared to break with tradition, the executive says, to improve its access to crucial technologies. Metalworking, electronics and telecommunications concerns are high on its list. One company mentioned prominently of late is Bergmann Elektricitaets Werke AG of Berlin. While Mr. von Kuenheim says no offer is planned yet for Bergmann or any other concern, chances are that BMW will make a major acquisition in the next year.    The other aspect of BMW's stay-ahead strategy can be seen inside any of its factories. Since the 1970s, BMW has offered its models in three distinct market classes: the 300 series at the bottom end; the midrange 500 series; and the top of the line 700 series. The cars were of different designs and used different parts. Now, with the introduction of the 700 series last year and the 500 this year, the two models look a lot alike and use many common parts. That cuts costs significantly.    And in the assembly plants themselves, Mr. von Kuenheim asserts, BMW productivity bests even the Japanese. &quot;There's no place in the world where automation is higher,&quot; he says of the Dingolfing plant in Bavaria, where the 500- and 700-series cars are assembled.    It is the success of these models that has Mr. von Kuenheim crowing. BMW's recent sales gains in Japan, West Europe and, particularly, Germany have been more than enough to offset its dollar-linked sales declines in the U.S. Mr. von Kuenheim predicts BMW will sell &quot;at least&quot; 170,000 cars in Germany alone this year, 15% more than in 1987.    The success is most striking where it matters: in the most profitable top-of-the-line vehicles. In the first half of this year, for instance, BMW sold 11,500 of the 700-series cars in West Germany, while Daimler-Benz sold 8,900 of its S-class cars. In fact, in every major European market, the top BMW now outsells the top Mercedes, though Daimler-Benz maintains a strong lead in the U.S.    &quot;They were never outsold before in that range of car,&quot; boasts Mr. von Kuenheim.    But he adds that despite its recent troubles, Daimler-Benz is a company that commands &quot;extreme respect.&quot; The Japanese haven't yet earned that distinction. &quot;Our priority is not what Honda is doing,&quot; he says. &quot;It is what Mercedes is doing.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
