The Taiwan delegation bluntly refused to reduce tariffs on about60 agricultural products or lift import bans on peanuts, poultryand animal organs.   Another U.S. request to renew a five-year bilateral agreementnext year that limits Taiwan's rice exports was also turned down.   Taiwan called for the scrapping of a 1986 agreement that allowsTaiwanese magazines to advertize American cigarettes, claiming itpromotes smoking and also causes hardship for local tobaccogrowers. U.S. officials rejected the request.   ``We would not consider reducing tariffs on agriculturalproducts because we did not protect our farmers more than yourcountry did,'' Vice Economic Minister Wang Chien-shien, who headsthe Taiwan delegation, said at the closing ceremony.   Taiwan officials, however, promised to review a U.S. proposalfor tariff cuts on about 110 industrial products to help reduceTaiwan's massive trade surplus with the United States, whichtotaled $16 billion last year.   Hundreds of farmers staged a protest in Taipei on Tuesday,calling on the government not to concede to any U.S. demands. Thefarmers claimed Taiwan's earlier tariff cuts on fruits and otheragricultural products have already hurt their livelihood.   Taiwan reduced tariffs on 3,500 foreign products in February,including 480 agricultural products, with import duties dropping toan average rate of 22.6 percent from 35 percent.   In the latest talks, Taiwanese negotiators agreed to takemeasures to curb the rampant infringement of U.S. copyrights butdiffered with their U.S. counterparts on major details.   Taiwan officials agreed in principle that translations of U.S.works require the permission of their authors, but opposed makingthe agreement retroactive.   Allgeier said U.S. companies lose ``tens of millions of U.S.dollars'' every year because of pirated U.S. works in Taiwan.   Taiwan agreed in 1985 to extend protection to all original U.S.copyrighted works published after 1975, but pirated books are stillavailable at many book stores. That agreement does not extend totranslations.   Taiwan also agreed tentatively to give either patent orcopyright protection to U.S. semiconductor products.</TEXT></DOC>
