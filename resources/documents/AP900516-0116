In another blow to the government and the crippled economy, theBush administration said it could not provide a $40 million loanfor legal reasons.   Striking public employees spent their second day occupyinggovernment buildings, but the capital was quiet this morning. Talksbetween the government and the strikers broke off around midnight,a Sandinista newspaper reported.   Nicaraguan and U.S. government officials accused the once-rulingSandinista National Liberation Front of trying to undermine theconservative administration, a charge no Sandinista official hasdenied publicly so far.   Sonia Ortiz, a labor leader, said the strikers want a 200percent pay raise, a subsidized food package, rehiring of a laborleader fired Monday, and the demobilization of the Contra rebels.   ``Lady Violeta has no idea what organized Sandinista workersare,'' she said.   The governing coalition UNO, which backed Mrs. Chamorro en routeto her Feb. 25 election victory, issued a letter of support forher. The 14-party coalition recently had been suffering fromfactional disputes.   Three weeks ago today, Mrs. Chamorro inherited an economyravaged by 11 years of leftist Sandinista mismanagement, the Contrainsurgency and a U.S. embargo that was lifted when she took office.Inflation is running about 70 percent a month.   In a cable to President Bush, Mrs. Chamorro appealed for a quick$40 million to curb the economic crisis that led to the strikeswhile Congress considers a $300 million aid request.   ``My country is bankrupt,'' she said in a cable dated May 11that was obtained Tuesday.   But a White House official said today that it cannot provide themoney because, as a temporary loan, the funds would have to be tiedto some future expectation of revenue.   Without assurances that lawmakers will approve the $300 millionin aid, the necessary guarantee was missing, the official said oncondition of anonymity. Bush instead planned to renew his plea forthe aid package, the official said.   Striking airport workers closed the international airport.Schools, banks and most communications were halted Tuesday, andonly about 20 buses operated, stranding thousands.   Public hospitals were open but one said it would limit treatmentto the very old or young, pregnant women and emergency cases.   Telephone, telegraph and telex communications were dead, cuttingoff most of Nicaragua from the rest of the world. Communicationsworkers allowed journalists to file stories but denied service toothers.   Outgoing phone service even to President Chamorro's offices wascut for several hours on Tuesday.   Government buildings in Managua remained occupied, butelectricity and water supplies to the capital were not halted earlytoday as threatened a day earlier by striking utility workers.   Officially, the goal is higher pay but Mrs. Chamorro is loomingas a major and growing target. Her government has declared thestrikes illegal.   Shouts of ``Violeta, start packing your bags!'' ``The people ownthe government, not the bourgeoisie!'' and ``Not one step back!''flew through muggy Managua streets Tuesday as workers occupied thebuildings and police stood by or made half-hearted attempts toremove them.   At the ministries of Agrarian Reform and Commerce and Industrythe police, most of whom were hired by the Sandinistas, stoodaround joking with the strikers.   Vice President Virgilio Godoy said on the radio the Sandinistasare ``trying to overthrow President Chamorro.''   ``It is unfortunate that the Sandinistas, despite their promisesto work with the Chamorro government to achieve economicreconstruction and national reconciliation, are engaging in whatappear to be politically motivated strikes,'' said U.S. StateDepartment spokesman Richard Boucher in Washington.   Officially, the strike is being coordinated by the Union ofNational Employees, a relatively obscure but militantlypro-Sandinista labor federation. It has a lower profile than thebetter-known Sandinista Workers Central, tied in the public eye tothe Sandinista organization.   Most government workers are Sandinistas left over from theprevious government.   But Dania Salazar, a communications worker, said she opposed thestrike because President Chamorro had been in office just threeweeks ``and we must let her try to do something first.''   Neither Mrs. Chamorro nor Sandinista former President DanielOrtega made a public statement about the walkouts Tuesday.   At the Foreign Ministry, an angry mob rushed Foreign MinisterEnrique Dreyfus and a group of Managua's newly appointedambassadors, who took refuge in a nearby restaurant.   ``You have no business in Nicaragua! Go back to Miami!'' the mobshouted at the diplomats inside the steak house.   Many anti-Sandinista Nicaraguans lived in Miami before Mrs.Chamorro took office April 25.   ``This is a trial by force with the Sandinistas,'' said ErnestoPalazio, appointed Nicaraguan ambassador to Washington, who stoodwith his fellow diplomats before the mob rushed them.   Mrs. Chamorro has promised to undo many of the leftist policiesenacted by the Sandinistas, who insist on retaining control of themilitary and say their revolutionary reforms should not be touched.</TEXT></DOC>
