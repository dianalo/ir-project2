Rosewood Financial, a Dallas-based investment company controlled by the Caroline Hunt Trust, offered $22 a share for the approximately 80% of Phillips-Van Heusen shares it doesn't already own. At that price, the company has an indicated value of about $340 million, including the value of stock options. Last month, the company split its stock 2.5-for-1, resulting in about 15 million shares outstanding.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday, Phillips-Van Heusen shares jumped $5.125, closing at $24.875. Volume was more than 2.1 million shares.    Analysts said the surge in price above the Rosewood offer means that investors expect either an effort by management to take the company private or the emergence of a new bidder, but no competing bidder has surfaced so far.    Phillips-Van Heusen makes clothing under such brand names as Van Heusen, Cricketeer, Geoffrey Beene, Country Britches and Cacharel. It had earnings of $20.1 million and sales of $514 million in the fiscal year ended Feb. 1.    Edward C. Cohen, vice president and general counsel, said, &quot;The board will consider (Rosewood Financial's) proposal after our financial and legal advisers have had an opportunity to review it carefully.&quot;    Eileen Gormley, an analyst with Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. said, &quot;For several years now, Phillips-Van Heusen has been considering a leveraged buyout.&quot; If the company wants to remain independent, she said, it is now under &quot;more pressure&quot; to proceed with a buyout.    In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors purchase a concern in a transaction financed largely by debt. Ultimately, the group's borrowings are repaid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or the sale of its assets.    Lawrence S. Phillips, Phillips-Van Heusen's chairman and chief executive officer, wouldn't comment Friday on whether the company still considers a leveraged buyout an option.    Earlier this month, Phillips-Van Heusen announced the sale of four clothing retailers -- Hamburger's, Kennedy's, Harris andamp; Frank, and Juster's -- to a new corporation, TJFC Inc., which is controlled by members of those stores' managements. The price wasn't disclosed. Ms. Gormley says the sale was a sign that the company was &quot;cleaning house,&quot; possibly in preparation for a leveraged buyout.    Mr. Cohen said that Phillips-Van Heusen officials have been in touch &quot;regularly&quot; with Rosewood Financial officials in recent months and had asked about their intentions, but he said, &quot;They really didn't tell us anything.&quot;    Rosewood Financial is one of a group of companies controlled by the Caroline Hunt Trust. Caroline Hunt, a member of the Hunt family of Texas oil fame, is a daughter of the late H.L. Hunt, and a sister of Nelson Bunker Hunt, Lamar Hunt and William Herbert Hunt.    Rosewood Financial has held some stock in Phillips-Van Heusen for about two years, and it increased its stake in January to 19.7% from 13.8%. A Rosewood spokesman said the company is pursuing an acquisition of Phillips-Van Heusen because it has been pleased with the company's performance.    Rosewood Financial's overtures could also be complicated by an anti-takeover plan enacted by Phillips-Van Heusen's board last month. Under it, shareholders could buy extra shares for half the market price if a hostile bidder acquired 20% of the company's shares, or made a tender offer for 30%. Company managers and directors own about 16% of Phillips-Van Heusen stock, and another 10% is owned by the company pension plan.    Rosewood Financial's offer is contingent on approval by Phillips-Van Heusen's board, and on completion of financing. The Rosewood Financial spokesman declined to discuss plans for the financing but said, &quot;We believe we would be able to get&quot; it.    In a letter to Phillips-Van Heusen's board dated Thursday, Mark W. Hobbs, president of Rosewood Financial, said that Phillips-Van Heusen had offered to buy back some of the shares Rosewood holds. But he said that Rosewood believed such a buyback wouldn't be &quot;in the best interests of all the shareholders&quot; of Phillips-Van Heusen.    Phillips officials couldn't be reached late Friday for comment on whether they had tried to buy back some of Rosewood's shares. </TEXT></DOC>
