In fact, recent opinion polls suggest that an increasingnumber of Germans are upset about the plan to replace themark with a pan-European currency. Worried members ofChancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Party concedethat they have a lot of convincing to do.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The big response from corner bars of Germany since thesigning of the Maastricht treaty shows that a substantialinformation effort is needed on the basis of Europeanmonetary union,&quot; said Michael Glos, deputy chairman of theChristian Democratic and Christian Social parliamentarygroup. &quot;Fears in the population have to be overcome, and ithas to be made clear that the deutschemark isn't being givenaway but transformed into an equally firm European currency.&quot;   The poll results demonstrate why the government isconcerned. In December, Allensbach Institute found that 49%of 2,107 people polled nationwide objected to the mark beingreplaced by a European currency. Only 26% were for it, 14%didn't care, and 11% weren't sure. In mid-February theElection Research Group, a Mannheim, Germany, polling group,found that 68% of 1,021 people polled didn't think it was agood idea to replace the mark, 28% supported the singlecurrency, and 4% were undecided.   Last week, the Wickert Institute in Tuebingen, Germany,found that 80% of 3,284 people polled knew what the Europeancurrency unit was. But of that majority, 72% were againstplans to introduce the ECU in place of the mark. Asked if inthe 1994 national election they would vote for a politicalparty they don't normally support if it opposed monetaryunion, 29% said yes.   For many Germans, the European summit in the Dutch city ofMaastricht finally brought home the unsettling fact that theplan for a single European currency isn't some distant goal.A year ago, when monetary union was still more of atheoretical concept, most Germans seemed generally supportiveof the notion, although their immediate attention was focusedon Germany's difficult unification.   Now, even leading industry and banking groups are urgingBonn against rushing currency union to meet the 1999deadline.   Gerhard Schmid, a Social Democrat and member of theEuropean Parliament, suggests that for many Germans, the markis not only a currency but a symbol of the nation's rebirthafter the militarist nationalism of the Third Reich. &quot;TheGerman identity since World War II was focused on thesuccessful social market economy and its symbol, the hardD-mark,&quot; Mr. Schmid said. &quot;So naturally there is a bigpsychological problem coping with the idea that this is allgoing to be abandoned.&quot;   Officials from both government and opposition parties saythe increasing public concerns about a single Europeancurrency don't yet seriously endanger ratification of theMaastricht accord by Germany's Bundestag this year. Under theplan, all 12 European Community parliaments must ratify theaccord by next year.   But now German officials are beginning to demand biggersteps toward political union by some of their fellow ECmembers and are likely to use flagging German enthusiasm asleverage. For example, Chancellor Kohl could argue thatplacing the future European central bank in Frankfurt wouldgo far toward allaying domestic pressure on the Germangovernment.   Chancellor Kohl also could try to convince other ECleaders that he can't sell the project at home withoutconcessions from them on political union. Mr. Kohl's effortto give more power to the European Parliament and greatercontrol over social policies to contain costs was blocked atMaastricht.   The opposition Social Democrats, who assailed Mr. Kohl forgiving in on political union in Maastricht, are pushing formore democratic controls on the EC Council of Ministers bygiving more legislative powers to the European Parliament.&quot;The {German} government parties will vote for ratificationwith no ifs, ands or buts,&quot; said the SPD's Mr. Schmid. &quot;Butwe want improvements to the treaty.&quot;   If nothing else, the Bonn government has its work cut outto prevent the currency debate from escalating into adomestic election issue in 1994. Already, politicalcartoonists and humorists lampoon Mr. Kohl as a would-beBismarck who signed away the mark to enter history books asthe unifier of both Germany and Europe.   It may be late, but the German government is gearing up a15 million mark ($9 million) information campaign promotingcurrency union and European integration in German newspaperadvertisements and brochures.</TEXT></DOC>
