Terms weren't disclosed.    Under the proposal, Westinghouse will hold 40% and AEG the remainder of the venture in production, development and marketing of railway systems, to be called AEG-Westinghouse Transportation Systems and based in West Germany.    The concerns would join their business in electrical-railroad engines, streetcars and other rail-guided vehicles, a deal which European analysts estimated would yield combined annual revenue of more than 500 million West German marks ($292.8 million).    A spokesman for AEG, West Germany's largest electrical group after Siemens AG, acknowledged that the move was to gain access to the U.S. market.    Pittsburgh-based Westinghouse -- an electrical-products maker, broadcaster and defense contractor -- will contribute to the venture its mass-transit propulsion equipment and automated-people-mover systems business, which employ about 850 people at West Mifflin, Pa.    AEG's portion will include its transportation facilities in West Berlin, Frankfurt and Bretten, West Germany, and in Los Angeles. AEG's transportation organization has 2,000 employees.    The main focus of the joint venture will be the production of short-distance mass rail transit systems. Both companies have developed small fully automated rail systems for short-distance transit, most widely used in large airports.    AEG has had strong business success with its electrical locomotives, streetcars and railroad electrical systems. Westinghouse declined to break out earnings or sales of its transportation segment, but a company spokesman said the mass-transit equipment business has been &quot;severely depressed.&quot;    Industry analysts estimated Westinghouse's transportation segment has annual revenue of about $100 million and &quot;modest&quot; profit or loss, depending on orders. &quot;They just haven't been able to string together enough orders to make a successful business,&quot; said one analyst.    For AEG, the move was seen as an effort to play to one of its business strengths as a way out of financial doldrums, which have plagued it for several years. In January, AEG, acquired by Daimler-Benz in 1985, had flat operating profit. Some AEG units, such as household appliances, have been a drag on the company.    The companies said completion of the transaction is subject to the execution of a definitive agreement, and approval of the boards of both companies and appropriate governmental agencies in both countries. </TEXT></DOC>
