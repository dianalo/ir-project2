The current rift came over revelations that Israel's Mossadsecret service mounted a covert intelligence operation in Englandusing a Palestinian double agent. British prosecutors said he spiedon another Palestinian wanted in connection with terrorist acts.   The Mossad carried out the operation without informing Britishauthorities of its activities or that the wanted man, Abder RahmaneMustafa, was living in Britain.   The British foreign office announced Friday it was expellingIsraeli diplomat Arie Regev ``because of activities incompatiblewith his diplomatic duties.'' It gave no further explanation.   Britain also expelled Zaki Al Hawa, a press officer at thePalestine Liberation Organization's London office, also withoutproviding a reason.   Israel's Foreign Ministry issued a statement expressing ``regretthat Her Majesty's government has seen fit to take the measure ofexpelling an Israeli diplomat. Israel did not act against anyBritish interests.''   Two years ago, British officials were angered over thedisappearance from London of Vanunu, a former technician atIsrael's nuclear plant in the southern town of Dimona. Vanunu, whohas since been convicted in Israel of espionage and treason,provided the information for a three-page report by the SundayTimes of London on the Jewish state's nuclear arsenal.   Although Israel has never officially admitted it, reportsindicate that the Mossad was responsible for Vananu's disappearanceand subsequent abduction to Israel. He was reportedly lured to Romeby a woman employed by the Mossad, then drugged and flown to Israel.   The latest disclosures about the Mossad were made during thetrial of the double-agent, Ismail Hassan Sowan, sentenced Thursdayto 11 years in prison for possessing explosives and firearms.   Sowan kept the weapons for Mustapha, who is suspected ofinvolvement in a series of terrorist actions, including the killingin London of Arab cartoonist Ali Naji Awad Al-Adhami. The Times ofLondon said an international arrest warrant had been issued forMustapha.   The current furor is the latest in relations between Israel andBritain, which have been turbulent since even before the foundingof Israel.   Jewish underground groups forces forced Britain, then the U.N.mandatory power, to leave Palestine. Britain abstained in the U.N.vote which led to Israel's establishment in 1948 and trainedJordan's army, which fought Israel during the 1948 Middle East War.   Relations warmed in the 1950s. In 1956, Israel, France andBritain formed an alliance to attack Egypt, after then-PresidentGamel Abdel Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal.   Britain imposed an arms embargo on Israel at the outbreak of the1967 Middle East War.   Relations had again warmed over the past few years because ofthe reportedly close ties between Foreign Minister Shimon Peres andPrime Minister Margaret Thatcher.</TEXT></DOC>
