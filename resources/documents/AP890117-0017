The third-ranking official in the Commerce Department or anotherCabinet agency would get a $42,500 raise, but a career federalspecialist in the food stamp program would receive an increase of$682.   And while a politically appointed agency bureau director wouldreceive a $39,500 increase, a mid-level manager in the Civil Servicesystem would only receive $1,263.   The pay proposals in President Reagan's budget are noteworthy fortheir disparity. There would be 50 percent increases for Congress,top political appointees and federal judges; 16.5 percent for manyjunior career executves; 3.6 percent for 2.1 million militarypersonnel, and just 2 percent for the 2.5 million-strong CivilService work force.   In addition, Reagan has proposed a one-year freeze incost-of-living adjustments for military and civilian retirees.   The 50 percent raises for 2,498 people _ lawmakers, judges andtop executive branch personnel _ would go into effect on Feb. 8unless both houses of Congress defeat the proposal. House leadershave indicated there will be no vote in the chamber by the deadline,a non-action that would trigger the top raises automatically.   Under the proposal, rank-and-file lawmakers' pay would rise to$135,000 from the current $89,500.   Lawmakers supporting the pay raise have said if the increase goesthrough, they will give up the right to earn outside income,including speaking fees.   Representatives of the government's Civil Service workers arecareful not to oppose the raise for members of Congress, becausethese same lawmakers must decide later whether to give federalemployees more than the 2 percent Reagan proposed. But they're notbashful about attacking the administration.   ``What outrages me is that the people who are responsible fordoing the work are ignored and insulted by the president,'' saidRobert M. Tobias, head of the National Treasury Employees Union,representing 145,000 federal workers.   ``It's the idea that some elitist group is solely responsible foraccomplishing the mission of the federal government.''   John Sturdivant, president of the largest federal employee union,the 700,000-member American Federation of Government Employees,said, ``I support the 50 percent. If you listen to some of therhetoric and look at the folks who have come out against it, thoseare the same people who will be opposing pay raises for the people Irepresent.''   ``Taking cheap shots at high-level folks is not going to doanything for the people I represent.''   But Sturdivant said Reagan is ``going out like he came in _bashing federal employees in his budget proposal.''   Joseph R. Wright Jr., director of the Office of Management andBudget, said it is incorrect to compare the proposed 50 percentincrease at top levels with the 2 percent for civil servants.   He said that civil servants have received steady raises eachyear, and are only three to five percentage points behind inflationsince 1969.   The salaries of top officials, he said, are down 35-40 percentcompared to inflation over the past 20 years. The administration istrying to let them recoup their losses all at once, he said.   ``Common sense and logic don't apply here,'' he commented. ``Youreach tough personal choices where you want to send kids to collegeand cant afford to. This is the only government we've got and itought to be well managed. We shouldn't buy executives on the cheap.''   James Lafferty, spokesman for the government's personnel agency,the Office of Personnel Management, said the president's budget isnot the key to determining the Civil Service pay scales.   More important, he said, is a government report due in Augustthat will compare federal pay scales to those of similar jobs in theprivate sector. Based on that report, he said, OPM will make arecommendation to the president on a pay raise.   Civil servants are paid under the ``general schedule'' (GS)scale, which has 18 different pay grades and 10 steps within mostgrades. The lowest grade, GS 1, begins at $10,213 and the highest,GS 18, has a single salary of $86,682. There's also a seniorexecutive service for government managers.   Some lawmakers believe congressional pay is an issue that muststand on its own. Among them is Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins, chairmanof the House Education and Labor Committee, who has been the chiefcongressional advocate of raising the minimum wage.   ``We should judge the (congressional) raise on whether it wouldimprove the quality of representation and lead to other reforms inethical conduct including honoraria,'' the California Democrat said.   ``I believe members should not have to vote on their own payraise. If I were required to vote on it, I would vote in favorbecause I believe the responsibilities of a congressman certainlyjustify more than we're now paid.   ``If a congressman doesn't think he's worth the amountrecommended, no law says he's got to take it.''</TEXT></DOC>
