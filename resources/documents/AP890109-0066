The justices will rule, sometime by July, on the validity of a1988 law that sought to ban all obscene and indecent messagesavailable through dial-a-porn services.   A federal judge in California ruled that the law could be appliedto ban all obscene messages, but he struck down the law's ban onmessages deemed merely indecent.   U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima in Los Angeles based hisJuly 19 ruling on past Supreme Court decisions that excluded obscenematerial _ but not all sexually explicit or indecent material _ fromconstitutional free-speech protections.   The Reagan administration appealed directly to the Supreme Court,challenging the part of the July ruling that protects indecentmaterial.   Sable Communications of California Inc., a major purveyor ofdial-a-porn services in that state, filed a counter-appealchallenging the part of Tashima's ruling that allows the ban onmaterials judged to be obscene.   Today, the justices granted review to both appeals.   Twice in 1988 the justices had refused to review dial-a-porncontroversies, in cases from Arizona and New York.   Obscenity is a legal term that does not apply to all sexuallyexplicit material.   The Supreme Court since 1973 has defined obscenity as a work thatappeals to a morbid interest in sex with patently offensivedepictions or descriptions of sexual conduct, and one that taken asa whole has no serious literary, artistic, political or scientificvalue.   Sexually explicit material, often called pornography, may or maynot be legally obscene.   In 1978, the high court drew a distinction between obscene and``indecent'' expression when it allowed federal regulators torestrict the broadcast of indecent language.   Upholding the government's power to punish use of ``dirty words''over the airwaves at times when children might be listening, thecourt seemed to adopt the Federal Communications Commission'sdefinition of indecent _ ``patently offensive references toexcretory and sexual organs or activities.''   Congress in 1983 imposed restrictions on the dial-a-porn businessbut did not seek a total ban until enacting the 1988 law.   ``Congress concluded that there was no sufficiently effectivemeasure to eliminate access of children to dial-a-porn short of anoutright ban,'' Justice Department lawyers told the court.   They said the court's 1978 decision restricting the broadcastingof indecent language ``suggests that (the 1988 law) is consistentwith the First Amendment,'' the constitutional protection of freedomof speech.   The government's appeal acknowledged, however, that the FCC'sgeneral counsel has said the commission believes the 1978 SupremeCourt ruling does not authorize a total ban on merely indecentlanguage.   Lawyers for Sable Communications argued that the entire 1988 lawshould be struck down.   Dial-a-porn companies make their services available to callersthrough 976-exchange numbers and ATandamp;T's area code 900 long-distancelines.   The telephone company typically charges callers according toper-call rates, retaining a portion of the charges and giving theremainder to the dial-a-porn company.   The 976 and 900 exchanges also are used for other,non-controversial types of messages such as sports scores, timechecks and stock market reports.   The cases are FCC vs. Sable Communications, 88-525, and SableCommunications vs. FCC, 88-515.</TEXT></DOC>
