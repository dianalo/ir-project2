Scott Dunn, Acting Administrator of the Food and NutritionService, has certified that this action will not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities. State and local welfareagencies are affected to the extent that they administer the Food StampProgram and must implement the provisions of this action for new Programapplicants and current participants.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>On July 17, 1987, the Department published an interim rule at 52 FR 26937implementing eligibility provisions on child support payments, JTPA programearnings, resources, and verification requirements contained in the FoodSecurity Act of 1985, enacted on December 23, 1985. The Department acceptedcomments on this rulemaking through September 15, 1987. Twelve letterswere received which addressed the provisions of the interim rule. Commentersincluded nine State agencies, one local agency, and two public interestgroups. The major concerns raised by the commenters are discussed below.Comments on non-discretionary provisions mandated by legislation, minortechnical issues not directly related to the rule, and those that wereunclear are not discussed. An explanation of the rationale of the ruleis contained in the preamble of the interim rule. The reader should referto the preamble of that rule for a full understanding of the provisionsof this final rule.Child Support Payments_Sections 273.9(c)(12), 276.2 (a) and (e) In accordance with section 5 of the Food Stamp Act of 1977 (7 U.S.C. 2012(f))as amended by section 1510(1) and (2) of Pub. L. 99-198, the interim rulepermitted States the option to exclude up to the first $50 per month ofTitle IV-D child support payments collected by the State on behalf of anAFDC family when computing FSP eligibility and benefit levels. States thatimplement this option will increase the food stamp benefit of some households.In addition, some previously ineligible households may become eligiblefor program benefits due to exclusion of these child support payments asincome. Pub. L. 99-198 further provides that the State agency must reimbursethe Federal Government for any additional food stamp benefit costs resultingfrom such an income exclusion. Five commenters addressed these provisions,with four commenters objecting to the required reimbursement. Pub. L. 99-198gave the Department no discretion to waive reimbursements, therefore, nochange can be made to this requirement. The legislative history accompanying Pub. L. 99-198 provides that the amountand method of collecting such reimbursement is left to the discretion ofthe Department. (<T3>See</T3> Senate Report No. 99-145; pages 237, 441.) The interim rulerequired State agencies to reimburse FNS either the actual or average costamount of increased household benefits resulting from the income exclusion.In the interim rule, the Department provided State agencies with a choicebetween two reimbursement methods: (1) The actual amount of increased householdbenefits resulting from granting the income exclusion or (2) an averagecost increase amount. Thus, under this rule, State agencies can implementonly one of the two reimbursement methods offered by the Department andmust apply that method to all affected cases in determining the reimbursementamount. The Department, however, believes that State agencies should beallowed to evaluate the feasibility of the method implemented and be providedwith an opportunity to use the other available method. Consequently, theinterim rule allowed State agencies to switch from one reimbursement methodto the other on an annual basis. The Department received several comments recommending that State agenciesuse only one reimbursement method and not be allowed to switch methods.One commenter felt that State agencies should use only the average methodto compute reimbursements as this method seems preferable to FNS. In addition,this commenter considered the average method less time-consuming for Stateagencies than the actual method. A related comment suggested that FNS requireState agencies to evaluate both reimbursement methods for one to two yearsand choose one method for permanent use. The Department considers bothreimbursement methods to be equally appropriate for compliance with thestatutory mandate to reimburse the Federal Government for increased costsassociated with the provision. Therefore, the Department believes thatState agencies should be provided the flexibility to use the method mostfeasible for their particular needs. Consequently, the interim reimbursementprovisions at 7 CFR 273.9(c)(12) and 276.2(a) and (e) are adopted finalwithout change. Current rules at 7 CFR 276.2 provide that if a State agency fails to paya bill for a Program loss, FNS may offset the amount of loss from the Stateagency's Letter of Credit. The interim rule contained an amendment to 7CFR 276.2 to clarify, by regulatory reference, that the losses coveredby this provision are those specified in 7 CFR 276.2(b), (c) and the newTitle IV-D reimbursement provisions added by the interim rule as 7 CFR276.2(e). However, through an oversight, a regulatory reference to 7 CFR276.2(e) was omitted from the interim rule amendment. This final actioncontains a technical amendment to 7 CFR 276.2(d) to correct this oversight.Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) Programs_Section 273.9(b)(1)(v) Section 1509(c)(1) of Pub. L. 99-198 amended section 5 of the Food StampAct (7 U.S.C. 2014) to require that, with one exception, earnings of individualsparticipating in on-the-job training programs under the Job Training PartnershipAct be counted as earned income for Food Stamp Program purposes. The exceptionis that such earnings of dependents less than 19 years of age are to betotally excluded. In the interim rule, the Department interpreted ``dependent'' to mean ``underthe parental control of another household member.'' The Department believesthat guidelines for applying this interpretation should be consistent withthose used in applying ``under parental control'' as it is used in 7 CFR273.1(a)(2)(i)(B) and 7 CFR 273.9(c)(7). Several commenters questioned or objected to the Department's interpretationof the term ``dependent.'' One commenter noted that State laws commonlyprovide that a minor becomes an adult at age 18 and is therefore not underparental control. The Department considers ``under parental control'' tobe the term most helpful in interpreting the ``dependent'' provision ofPub. L. 99-198. Policy Memo 79-185, dated November 24, 1978, applies theterm ``parental control'' to minors who are dependents_financial or otherwise_ofthe household as opposed to independent units. The term ``under parentalcontrol'' makes the provision consistent to the extent possible with currentpolicy at 7 CFR 273.9(c)(7) related to the earnings of children under age18. Expansion of the term's application to individuals who are under age19 reflects Congressional intent to ``make income generated from a JTPAProgram by older children living at home exempt from consideration.'' (<T3>See</T3> H. Rept. No. 99-127, 99th Cong., 1st Session, Pg. 456, reprintedat 1985 U.S. Code Cong. and Ad. News 1559-1560.) It is the Department'sposition that application of the term ``under the parental control of anotherhousehold member'' is not limited to individuals under age 18 and wouldexcompass the dependent less than 19 years old. Thus, this final actionretains the phrase as it appears in the interim provision at 7 CFR 273.9(b)(1)(v).Two commenters requested that the Department clarify whether income exclusionsapply to allowances and reimbursements. One commenter questioned whetherthe earnings exclusion for individuals under age 19 applies to their actualwages, or to their stipends for meals and transportation while they lookfor a job, or to both. Another commenter questioned the scope of JTPA incomeinclusions for individuals age 19 or older; i.e., whether reimbursementsfor transportation to and from the job-training site are defined as incomefor food stamp purposes. The JTPA (Pub. L. 97-300, 96 State. 22, October 13, 1982) excludes fromconsideration as income allowances, earnings, and payments to individualsparticipating in job training programs under the JTPA. Pub. L. 99-198 supercedesthis income exclusion provision with regard to on-the-job training programsunder section 204(5), Title II, of the JTPA. Section 1509(c)(1) of Pub.L. 99-198 defines as income only earnings to individuals over age 19 participatingin JTPA on-the-job programs. Thus, the income exclusion provision of theJTPA of 1982 remains in effect for all other JTPA training program allowancesor program payments (including allowances, reimbursements or stipends formeals, transportation or other costs).The Department is also taking this opportunity to make a technical amendmentto the interim JTPA provisions codified at 7 CFR 273.9(b)(1)(v). This provisionas currently written applies to all on-the-job training programs underthe JTPA. The language of Pub. L. 99-198 clarifies that the provision isrelevant only to on-the-job training programs which are under section 204(5),Title II, of the JTPA. It has come to the Department's attention that thereare on-the-job training programs which are not under section 204(5), TitleII, of the JTPA and the provision at 7 CFR 273.9(b)(1)(v) could be misappliedto include these programs. To ensure proper application of the provision,this final action amends 7 CFR 273.9(b)(1)(v) to conform the provisionto the language of the statute by adding a reference to section 204(5),Title II, of the JTPA. The JTPA of 1982 replaced the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act(CETA). With regard to training allowances, provisions of the JTPA of 1982differ significantly from those of the expired CETA for food stamp purposes.Whereas training allowances from programs authorized by CETA were includedin the definition of earned income, ``to the extent they are not a reimbursement''(7 CFR 273.9(b)(1)(iii)), JTPA provisions exclude as income such allowances.To update regulations which address training allowances, a technical amendmentis made to 7 CFR 273.9(b)(1)(iii) to eliminate the section's referenceto the expired CETA and specifies the treatment of JTPA training allowances,which are excluded as income. Four commenters were concerned about the application of school enrollmentrequirements to dependent household members under age 19 who receive earningsfrom JTPA on-the-job training programs. One commenter wanted the Departmentto specify whether the school attendance provision in 7 CFR 273.9(c)(7),which applies to earnings of children under age 18, also applies to JTPAearnings of individuals under age 19. Another commenter objected to theDepartment's assumption that the student provision has been dropped asa condition for the disregard of JTPA earnings. Two commenters felt thatthe JTPA income exclusions should be applied only to individuals underage 18 who are at least half-time students. The provisions of Pub. L. 99-198 do not require that dependents under age19 be enrolled in school. In addition, the legislative history containsno discussion of school enrollment regarding JTPA participants. Therefore,the Department cannot mandate that participants in JTPA on-the-job trainingprograms who are dependents under age 19 be students in order for householdsto qualify for the JTPA income exclusion. This final action amends 7 CFR273.9(b)(1)(v) to clarify that school attendance and/or enrollment is nota factor in applying income exclusions to the JTPA earnings of dependenthousehold members less than 19 years of age.Resources_Sections 273.8(e)(15), 273.8(h)(1)(vi) Resource provisions in section 1514(2)(A) of Pub. L. 99-198 provided theDepartment with the discretion to expand the definition of excluded resources.Reflecting Congressional intent, the interim rule excluded as ``inaccessible,''non-liquid resources which have a lien against them and which the householdis prohibited by the security or lien holder (creditor) from selling. TheDepartment received no comments with significant issues to resolve, thereforethe interim provision at 7 CFR 273.8(e)(15) is finalized without change.In addition, reflecting section 1514(2)(B) of Pub. L. 99-198, the interimrule provided that property, real or personal, is excludable to the extentthat it is directly related to the ``maintenance or use'' vehicles whichannually produce income or are necessary to transport a physically disabledhousehold member. The interim rule explained that it is not the intentof Congress to exclude as a resource the full value of a one-acre lot ifonly one-quarter of that acre is used for parking and maintenance purposes.The exclusion is intended to give households a monetary credit based onthe use of a portion of the property only. Consequently, a household cannotclaim entitlement to an exclusion for the full value of a one-acre lotbecause State and local laws prohibit subdividing of property, or the householdis somehow prohibited from converting the property to a cash resource.Therefore, only the one-quarter acre actually used for parking and maintenancepurposes would be excluded under this resource provision. Two commenters recommended changes concerning determination of an allowableportion of property to be excluded. One commenter felt that FNS shouldestablish guidelines for such determinations. The interim rule was explicitin conveying the Department's position that no regulatory formula is beingestablished for determining the exact portion of related property to beapplied under this provision. This position is based on the Department'sbelief that State agencies should have the flexibility to make such determinationson a case-by-case basis. A second commenter suggested that the regulatorylanguage clearly say that the portion of property to be excluded is determinedby the State. Current regulations at 7 CFR 273.8(c) make clear that itis the responsibility of State agencies to determine the resources of ahousehold. The interim provision at 7 CFR 273.8(h)(1)(vi) is consistentwith other resource provisions in providing State agencies with sufficientdirection to determine the resource eligibility of food stamp households.The interim provision did not decrease the State agency's responsibilityfor determining resource eligibility, therefore, it is adopted final withoutchange. Accordingly, the text of the interim provision at 7 CFR 273.8(h)(1)(vi)is adopted final. However, commenters noted two corrections that shouldbe made relative to the interim provision at 7 CFR 273.8(h)(1)(vi). First,the regulatory reference to paragraph ``(h)(1)(vi)'' contained in the interimprovision should read ``(h)(1)(v).'' Secondly, the interim provision isa resource exclusion provision and more appropriately belongs in 7 CFR273.8(e), <T3>Exclusions from resources.</T3> Technical amendments are hereby madeto 7 CFR 273.8(e) and (h) to reflect these necessary corrections.Verification_Section 273.2(f)Prior to implementation of the interim rule, 7 CFR 273.9(f)(2) containeda requirement to verify household size based on the Department's discretionaryauthority to mandate verification of eligibility criteria. Additionally,7 CFR 273.2(f) provided that State agencies could elect to verify any nonmandatoryfactor which affects household eligibility and benefit levels as long asthe requirement to verify these factors was based on error-prone householdprofiles. In accordance with section 1517 of Pub. L. 99-198, the interimrule amended 7 CFR 273.2(f) to make clear that verification of questionablehousehold size is required by statute. Statutory mandates for verificationappear at 7 CFR 273.2(f)(1). Therefore, the interim rule continued priorverification provisions at 7 CFR 273.2(f)(2)(i), but moved them from <T3>Verification of questionable information </T3>to 7 CFR 273.2(f)(1),<T3>Mandatory verification. </T3>Also, in accordance with section 1517of Pub. L. 99-198, the interim rule provided greater authority for Stateagencies to elect verification of factors which affect household eligibilityor benefit level by removing references to the requirement that such verificationmust be based on error-prone profiles. State agencies can still use error-proneprofile indicators in exercising their option to verify factors, but areno longer required to do so.Several commenters addressed the provisions on verification of householdsize. One commenter requested that FNS provide guidelines defining acceptableverification of household size. The Department is not adopting this commentbecause it believes that State agencies are in the best position to determinewhat types of third-party information or documentation constitute acceptableverification. Another commenter recommended that the provision mandatingverification of household size when questionable be modified to allow Stateagencies to periodically reverify household size. The Department is notadopting this comment. The Department believes that existing regulatoryprovisions already afford State agencies sufficient opportunity to reverifyhousehold size periodically, at recertification (7 CFR 273.2(f)(8)(c)),when changes are reported (7 CFR 273.2(f)(8)(c)(ii)), or during the monthlyreporting cycle (7 CFR 273.21(i)(3)). These three opportunities for recertificationvary in frequency of occurrence, and State agencies have the flexibilityto determine when such recertification should occur.Accordingly, the interim verification provisions at 7 CFR 273.9(f)(1)(ix)and (f)(3) are adopted as final without change. However, a technical amendmentis being made to correct an error in regulatory references. A previousrule added a new paragraph (f)(l)(ix) to 7 CFR 273.2. Consequently, theamendment to redesignate 7 CFR 273.2(f)(2)(i) as 7 CFR 273.2(f)(1)(ix)contained in the interim rule resulted in two provisions having the sameregulatory designation. This action corrects this oversight by redesignatingthe household size verification provision at 7 CFR 273.2(f)(1)(ix) as 7CFR 273.2(f)(1)(x).Implementation_Section 272.1(g)The implementation section of the interim rule (7 CFR 272.1(g)(90)) requiredState agencies to implement the provisions of the rule retroactively toApril 1, 1987 as required by Pub. L. 99-198, except for the provisionsgoverning the treatment of Title IV-D income at 7 CFR 273.9(c)(12) and7 CFR 276.2, which is a State agency option. Retroactive implementationof the interim provisions at 7 CFR 273.9(b)(1)(v) involving JTPA on-the-jobtraining program earnings led to a number of comments about quality control(QC) and overissuance claims.The interim rule provided that QC shall not identify variances resultingsolely from implementation or nonimplementation of the interim rule incases with review dates between April 1, 1987 and August 31, 1987. TheDepartment received several comments regarding the QC policy of the interimrule. Commenters recommended that what they lable as the hold harmless(grace period) provision be amended to protect States from QC errors onactions completed before September 1, 1987. Another commenter requestedthat FNS exclude implementation errors from the QC error rate for six monthsfollowing interim rule publication (July 17, 1987) rather than betweenApril 1, 1987 and August 31, 1987.This final action amends 7 CFR 272.1(g)(90) to clarify the circumstancesunder which QC would end the grace period and begin to code variances inindividual cases. To code a variance, four conditions had to be met: (1)The review date occurred after August 31, 1987; (2) the State agency certifiedor recertified the case (or was required to recertify the case) after August31, 1987; (3) the certification or recertification was effective for thereview date (or the required recertification should have been effectivefor the review date); and (4) in a retrospective budget system, the household'sbudget month was September 1987 or later or in a prospective budget system,the issuance month was September 1987 or later.This means that if any active or negative case's review date fell on orbefore August 31, 1987, QC must exclude any implementation variance (whichincludes failure to implement). This provision also means that if the Stateagency certified or recertified the case on or before August 31, 1987 effectivefor the review date and its next recertification was not required untilafter the review date, QC must exclude any implementation variance.If the State agency was required to recertify a case, but did not do so,QC shall consider the State agency to have failed to properly handle thecases; as such, QC would identify an implementation variance if one existed.The interim rule provided State agencies with guidance in restoring benefits,but comments received by the Department indicate a need for clarificationin handling overissuance claims. Four commenters suggested that FNS permitStates to waive claims establishment and collection for retroactive overissuancesresulting from JTPA earnings being included as income. Another commenterrequested that FNS create a new category of overissuance for the retroactiveperiod which is neither client nor agency error and provide instructionson how to handle cases affected by the interim rule.The Department agrees with commenters that there is a need to clarify theissue of JTPA overissuance claims. As commenters pointed out, retroactiveimplementation of the provision to count certain JTPA earnings as incomeresulted in overissued benefits to households affected by the provision.It is the Department's view that the number of households affected by theprovision is not significant. In light of this, the Department believesthat the administrative burden associated with establishing and collectingthese JTPA overissuance claims would outweigh the amount of benefits thatcould be recovered. Therefore, this final action clarifies this issue byamending 7 CFR 272.1(g)(90) to provide that State agencies not establisha claim for any household which received overissued benefits resultingsolely from retroactive implementation of the JTPA income provision.This action also clarifies that any affected household that applied forFSP benefits from April 1, 1987 until implementation of this rule and wasdenied benefits is entitled to restored benefits back to the date of applicationor April 1, 1987, whichever occurred later, if the household is otherwiseentitled to benefits and requests a review of its case or the State agencyotherwise becomes aware that a review is needed. This is true regardlessof when such a situation is identified.This action also clarifies that the provision at 7 CFR 273.17, limitingrestored benefits to 12 months, does not apply to households entitled torestored benefits under the July 17, 1987, interim regulations. This clarificationis made by adding a new sentence to 7 CFR 272.1(g)(90).Additionally, this final action addresses implementation of the technicalamendment to 7 CFR 273.9(b)(1)(v). As discussed earlier in this preamble,this final action restricts application of 7 CFR 273.9(b)(1)(v) to on-the-jobtraining programs under section 204(5), Title II, of the JTPA. Therefore,this action amends 7 CFR 272.1(g) to add a new paragraph which requiresState agencies to implement this provision for new applicant householdsno later than June 1, 1989.The rule clarifies that affected households which newly applied for Programbenefits during the period of April 1, 1987, and the date the State agencyimplements the provision in andSection;273.9(b)(1)(v) of this final actionand were denied benefits shall be provided restored benefits back to April1, 1987, or the date of the food stamp application, whichever occurs later,if the household is otherwise entitled to benefits and requests a reviewof its case or the State agency otherwise becomes aware that a review isneeded. State agencies shall convert their current caseload to this JTPAprovision at household request, recertification, or when the case is nextreviewed, whichever occurs first. Restored benefits shall be provided tosuch households, if applicable, back to April 1, 1987, or the date of thefood stamp application, whichever occurs later.Again, this action clarifies that the provision at 7 CFR 273.17, limitingrestored benefits to 12 months, does not apply to households entitled torestored benefits resulting from implementation of the provision in andSection;273.9(b)(1)(v)of this final action.Quality control errors resulting from application of the provisions ofthis final action during the required implementation time frame, shallbe handled in accordance with regulations published November 2, 1988, at53 FR 44171.CorrectionThe Department is taking this opportunity to correct an error which appearedin a final rule published on February 15, 1989, at 54 FR 6990.On page 7003, in the third column, amendatory statement number 6.b underPart 273 is incorrect. The statement as currently worded provides thatthe current provisions at 7 CFR 273.1(f)(1)(i) (A) and (B), which restrictthe use of authorized representatives for completing the food stamp applicationon behalf of applicant households, are being removed. It is the Department'sintent to remove the provisions at 7 CFR 273.2(f)(1) (ii) and (iii) governingthe use of authorized representatives to obtain and use coupons on thehousehold's behalf because these provisions are being relocated to Part274 by this same rule. This inadvertent error is hereby corrected by republishingamendatory statement number 6.b. as it should be read.Additional Technical Amendments_Sections 273.11(e), 278.1(e), 273.7(b),273.2(e)On April 13, 1987, the Department published a final rulemaking (at 52 FR11811) which contained three FSP provisions contained in the Food SecurityAct of 1985. One of these provisions allowed FSP participation by residentsof publicly operated community mental health centers which conduct residentialprograms for drug addicts and/or alcoholics under Part 13 of title XIXof the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300x et seq.). The preambleto this rulemaking explained that on June 8, 1979, the Department publishedan interim rule which included an amendment to provide that alcoholic anddrug addiction treatment and rehabilitation programs do not have to beauthorized as retail food stores in order for their residents to be certifiedto participate in the FSP. The April 13, 1987, final action amended 7 CFR273.1(e) and 273.11(e) to reflect this policy. However, through an oversight,a conforming amendment was not made to 7 CFR 273.11(e)(7) at that time.Consequently, this final action makes a technical amendment to 7 CFR 273.11(e)(7)to conform it to the earlier change. Consistent with the effective datein the April 13, 1987, rule, this technical amendment is effective on February25, 1986. Since this is a technical correction to conform to a policy whichhas already been implemented, no further implementation action is necessary.Additionally, the preamble to the April 13, 1987, final rule explainedthat amendments were being made to 7 CFR 278.11(e)(1) and 7 CFR 273.1(e)to conform the provisions to the language of the Food Stamp Act of 1977,as amended by section 1501 of the Food Security Act of 1985. The April13 conforming amendments were intended to reflect the removal of the word``funded'' from the two provisions. However, through an oversight, theApril 13 amendment to the first sentence of 7 CFR 278.1(e) was incorrectand the conforming amendment was not made. Consequently, this action containsa technical amendment to the first sentence of 7 CFR 278.1(e) to conformthe provision to intended policy by removing the word ``funded.''On March 28, 1987, the Department published a final rulemaking (51 FR 10764)which contained a technical amendment to the last sentence of 7 CFR 273.7(b)(1)(vii)to reinstate language unintentionally removed from the Code of Federalregulations (CFR) by a previous rulemaking. However, a portion of the languageintended to be reinstated was omitted from the March 28 amendment. Consequently,this action contains a technical amendment to the last sentence of 7 CFR273.7(b)(1)(vii) to reinstate the missing language in the appropriate sectionof the CFR.Lastly, current regulations at 7 CFR 273.2(e)(2) state that if a food stampapplicant household is unable to appoint an authorized representative andis unable to come to the food stamp office because its members are 65 yearsof age or older, the office interview will be waived if the household sorequests (7 CFR 273.2(e)(2)). This section of the regulations implementedthe provisions of section 11(e)(2) of the Food Stamp Act of 1977 whichmade the exception to the office interviews requirement available to the``elderly.'' Following the promulgation of 7 CFR 273.2(a)(2), Congressenacted the definition of ``elderly or disabled member'' codifed at 7 U.S.C2012(r) which defines ``elderly'' as being age 60 or over. (Pub. L. 97-253,145(a), 96 Stat. 763, 773 (1982).) This final action amends 7 CFR 273.2(e)(2)to bring the provision into conformity with the statutory definition ofan ``elderly'' member.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>7 CFR Part 272Alaska, Civil rights, Food stamps, Grant programs-social programs, Reportingand recordkeeping requirements.7 CFR Part 273Administrative practice and procedure, Aliens, Claims, Food stamps, Fraud,Grant programs-social programs, Penalties, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements, Social security, Students.7 CFR Part 276Administrative practice and procedure, Food stamps, Fraud, Grant programs-socialprograms, Penalties.7 CFR Part 278Administrative practice and procedures, Banks, Banking, Claims, Food stamps,Groceries-retail, Groceries, General line-wholesaler, Penalties.Therefore, 7 CFR Parts 272, 273, 276 and 278 are amended as follows:1.
