The principles used for radioactivesources are considered, but only for those sources which are 'sealed'according to International Organization for Standardization (ISO) regulations.The main devices which contain such sources and the radioisotopes inthe sources are listed. The ISO regulations and the IAEA standards fortransportation were compared and it was found that the latter could wellcomplement the former. The concept of 'greatest efficiency with the lowesthazardousness' is introduced, with the proposal that it replace the currentconcept that regulates the construction of sources according to the standardsfor radioprotection. During construction all possible technological meansshould be used to attain an 'absolute' reduction in the dangerous elementsin the sources, aside from any radioprotection considerations. This isnecessary mainly in order to prevent radioprotection technology fromcoming to a halt at the standards reached and the values for maximumallowed doses being considered as routine values. For example, mentionis made of UNI (Ente di Unificazione Nazionale Italiano, Italian Bureauof Standards) Standard Sc.4 on Radioactive Sources, which governs theconstruction of /sup 241/Am sources of 'smoke detectors' on the basisof the above concept. This standard should be introduced because it usesthe most well known methods for reducing risk while ensuring maximumefficiency. A list of the parameters believed to be fundamental to areduction in the risk in question is given. (author). 8 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
