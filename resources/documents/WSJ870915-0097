The product, which will go into test markets next year, represents a substantial technological effort to counter critics of smoking. &quot;We believe this will prove to be a major alternative that expands the options for smokers,&quot; said Edward A. Horrigan Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of the company's R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. unit.    Tobacco analysts generally applauded the product's potential. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, RJR shares rose to a high of $69.625 before falling back to close at $66.75, down $1, on volume of 1,940,000 shares. That followed a $2.875 run-up Friday on speculation about the announcement.    The new cigarette will present a tricky marketing problem because RJR must extol the healthy features of this product without undercutting its other brands. And the company, which plans to command a premium price for the cigarette, must hope smokers like the taste and its unusual new design features.    &quot;There's a chance the consumer could turn his nose up at it like new Coke,&quot; said Marc I. Cohen, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co. On the other hand, he noted, &quot;it could change the fundamentals of the industry,&quot; putting RJR more on the offensive on issues of health and social acceptability of smoking.    At a news conference here, Atlanta-based RJR unveiled the carbon-tipped cigarette. When lit, the tip warms air that in turn passes through tobacco and then through a &quot;flavor capsule&quot; containing flavorings, tobacco extract and glycerin. Next, the smoke is cooled as it passes through a tobacco filter and a regular cigarette filter. Finally, it is inhaled by the smoker.    The cigarette is designed to give the smoker the tobacco flavor and nicotine of a regular cigarette. But because the tobacco doesn't actually burn, the new cigarette doesn't contain tar, a product of combustion. As a result, 90% of the compounds that are created by combustion and associated with smoking's health hazards would be eliminated, according to the company. &quot;Simply put, we think this will be the world's cleanest cigarette,&quot; Mr. Horrigan said.    The cigarette's other features include no &quot;sidestream&quot; smoke from the tip after the first few puffs, and exhaled smoke that dissipates more rapidly than current cigarettes. When left lying flat, it wouldn't be likely to ignite other materials. The cigarette wouldn't burn down, but rather remain lit for about as long as a conventional 85-millimeter cigarette. It ultimately extinguishes itself, and the smoker disposes of the entire cigarette.    Mr. Horrigan cautioned that the product is still under development and that it is possible it may never make it to market. But he said he was &quot;highly confident it will continue on a successful path,&quot; noting that the cigarette has won favorable reviews from smokers in taste tests to date.    He said the cigarette will be test-marketed in &quot;limited geographical areas&quot; and at a variety of prices next year. The product may go national as soon as 1988, as well, in some analysts' view, because RJR's announcement probably will spur archrival Philip Morris Cos.' development of a competing product.    A spokesman for New York-based Philip Morris said, &quot;We are confident that we have the capability to match or exceed the competition in the area of new-product development or cigarette manufacturing technology.&quot; But he wouldn't discuss Philip Morris's plans, citing &quot;competitive reasons.&quot;    For its part, RJR framed the new product in terms of such past innovations as the filter cigarette, which it pioneered with its Winston brand in 1954. And some analysts believe that, like the filter, the new product could redefine the cigarette.    &quot;By 1993 or 1994, this could theoretically displace all cigarettes as we know them today,&quot; said David A. Goldman, an analyst with L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin Inc. &quot;It addresses the health aspect, the social and the fire (hazard).&quot;    Analysts said the product could keep &quot;marginal&quot; smokers -- those who may be on the fence about quitting -- in the tobacco camp. That would help slow the decline in U.S. cigarette consumption, which has been running about 2% annually.    But success isn't assured. Industry executives said the manufacturing process will be more complicated than current cigarette production. The new cigarette's many attributes could make for a confusing product to consumers. And RJR won't be able to use television, the powerful medium through which other new consumer products can be pushed.    Some marketing executives noted that a cigarette aimed at assuaging consumer concerns about cigarettes also could underscore -- rather than answer -- those concerns. &quot;What's being said in an unspoken way is that the stuff that burns and smolders is dangerous,&quot; said Jack Trout, president of Trout andamp; Ries Inc., a New York-based marketing consulting firm.    That could raise questions about the company's other brands, an issue that Mr. Horrigan addressed at the news conference. &quot;We aren't saying this is a safe or safer cigarette, because we aren't agreeing with the allegations against the industry,&quot; he said. What the the company wanted to do, he insisted, is &quot;address the perceptions regarding cigarettes.&quot;    Indeed, RJR would like the product to be hailed by those who have fought public smoking on the grounds that so-called secondary smoke is hazardous to nonsmokers. &quot;We believe it will be well received by those people who object to tobacco smoke,&quot; Mr. Horrigan said. </TEXT></DOC>
