During the 1970s it seemed to many demographers, includingCalvin L. Beale of the USDA's Economic Research Service, that ruralliving was on a roll, that people flocking from the cities wereturning the tide of decades of migration from farms and small towns.   But the human tide weakened in the early 1980s as the economyfaltered, farmland values plummeted and rural employment suffered.Quickly, says Beale, the ``exceptional rural and small-town growthof the previous decade ended.''   A study of ``metro'' and ``non-metro'' counties shows thatduring the years of the population turnaround, Americans once againbegan heading for the cities.   The federal government says a metro area is one having a city ofat least 50,000 as a nucleus and adjacent communities that have ahigh degree of economic and social integration with that city.   Beale said that in the 1980-83 period, the non-metro populationincreased at the rate of 0.83 percent a year, which once againtrailed the metro gain of 1.1 percent annually. Moreover, therewere 720 non-metro counties with population declines, half again asmany as in the low levels of the 1970s.   Even so, the rural population balance looked pretty good bycomparison with the 1950s and 1960s, when huge waves of peoplemoved from farms and small towns to the cities.   And then the situation worsened.   From 1983 to 1986, despite a recovery in the national economy,the ability of rural areas to attract or retain people rapidlydeteriorated, Beale said. The annual non-metro population increasedropped to 0.42 percent per year, only half as high as the 1980-83rate, while the annual metro population increase rose slightly to1.12 percent.   It is this science of numbers, decimals and fractions that makesthe lives of demographers exciting. And shifts in where people livecan translate into huge meanings for the nation as a whole aseconomies of small towns, counties and cities gain or lose.   Beale's analysis is in the current issue of RDP, or RuralDevelopment Perspectives, a periodical issued three times a year bythe department's Economic Research Service.   In his assessment, Beale said that the very low growth ofnon-metro population in the 1983-86 period was ``the most strikingfeature of post-1980 trends.''   During that time, 1,306 counties, or 55 percent of all non-metrocounties in the country, lost residents between 1983 and 1986.   ``The average loss per county was not large, but the incidenceof loss was as widespread as when farm consolidation was at itspeak in the 1960s, when 53 percent of the non-metro counties lostpopulation, and in the 1950s, 54 percent,'' Beale said.   But there are bright spots, too. Counties known as retirementhavens continue to attract new residents, not just older people butyounger workers who provide services and goods to the retiredpopulation.   These counties grew annually by more than 1.78 percent from 1980to 1986, more than double the national rate, Beale said.   Also, non-metro counties with a fourth or more of theirresidents commuting to jobs in metro areas grew by 1.13 percent ayear, a bit faster than the national growth rate, although a sharpdecline from their 1.92 percent gains in the 1970s.   ``After mid-1983, non-metro counties with any growth at all werea rarity throughout the Great Plains, Corn Belt and central andnorthern Appalachia,'' Beale said. ``In Iowa, the quintessentialfarm state, 84 of 88 non-metro counties lost population from 1983to 1986, as outmovement more than offset any excess of births overdebts.''   Beale said lower birth rates also help prompt the populationdecline in rural areas. During the 1950s and 1960s, the non-metrobirth rate was considerably higher than the more recent rate. Inthe 1960s, it averaged more than 20 births per 1,000 people, withthe death rate at less than 10 per 1,000.   In 1980-86, the rural birth rate was 15.6 per 1,000 people, adecline of about a fourth from the 1960s, while the death rate wasabout the same at 9.6 per 1,000.   But Beale said ``the worst may be over'' for non-metro areas interms of economically related population declines. Farm income,supported heavily by federal subsidies, was at an all-time high in1987, debts have declined somewhat, exports have improved,commodity surpluses have declined and 1988 cash income is expectedto be second only to last year's.   ``These positive factors do not presage an increase in the farmpopulation, for there is no need for additional farmers,'' he said.``But if the improved conditions are sustained, they should lead toresumed local investment and spending, and greater retention ofpopulation in farm counties.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Aug. 28</NOTE></DOC>
