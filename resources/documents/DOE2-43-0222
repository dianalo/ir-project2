For the Federal Republic of Germany and selectedareas of Europe the regional distribution of emissions is establishedfor the year 1982 and its future development is estimated. The analysisof the pollutant concentration and deposition for sulphur dioxide inthe Federal Republic of Germany confirm the high contribution of foreignemissions. The planned national emission reduction measures will considerablylessen ground level concentration, but not to the extent expected. Thefact that for nitrogen oxides such a clear reduction of emissions cannot be expected is due to the high releases from transport which mustbe expected also for the future. This sector is not only the main emittorof nitrogen oxides, but also of hydrocarbons. A number of model calculationsfor selected central European conditions demonstrates the special relevanceof these two compounds which are key substances for the formation ofanthropogenic ozone.
