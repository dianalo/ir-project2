Standard Trustco and its major shareholder, financiallytroubled Roman Corp., hope they can find an investor withdeep pockets to take the struggling trust company off theirhands.</LP><TEXT>   Standard Trust has been operating under the careful eyesof regulators and its bankers since an audit of the company'sfinancial statements in July. Following the audit, thecompany wrote down its assets by 51.4 million Canadiandollars (US$44.8 million) and restated its six monthsearnings, turning a profit of C$5.3 million, or 69 Canadiancents (US60 cents) a share, into a loss of C$50.2 million, orC$7.15 a share.   The trust company's problems started last year when aseries of real estate loans turned sour. Since then, it hasbeen struggling to maintain its capital base and continueoperations.   In the first nine months, Standard Trustco reported a lossof C$58.8 million, or C$8.40 a share, compared with netincome of C$12.0 million, or C$1.60 a share, a year earlier.Nonperforming loans for the period rose to C$230.1 millionfrom C$27.5 million a year earlier. Assets totaled C$1.75billion.   Standard Trustco's shares have been in a free fall sincethe audit was announced. On the Toronto Stock Exchangeyesterday, the company's common shares fell 20 Canadian centsto C$1.80, well off a 52-week high of C$24.   The problems at Standard Trustco are an isolated case inCanada. Unlike the U.S. thrift industry, Canada's trustcompanies remain in good health. Tight government regulationshave largely kept the trusts away from risky real estate andcommercial lending ventures.   Juri Koor, Standard Trustco's newly appointed presidentand chief executive officer, said &quot;the possible sale of ourinterest in Standard Trust won't affect our commitment torevitalize the trust company. Once we solve our currentproblems, I expect to see Standard Trust resume its role as aleader in Canada's financial services industry, regardless ofwho the owner might be.&quot;   The sale of Standard Trust would generate some much neededcash for Roman. In November, Roman put its 26% stake inprinting and packaging concern Lawson Mardon Group Ltd. upfor sale. Its 24%-held Denison Mines Ltd. is suffering fromslumping uranium prices and can't unload oil and gas assetsthat have been up for sale for almost two years.   On the Toronto exchange yesterday, Roman's shares slumped23 Canadian cents to a 52-week low of C$2, well off its highof C$9.25.</TEXT></DOC>
