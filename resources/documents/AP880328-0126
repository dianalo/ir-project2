The survey by the National Committee on Pay Equity said morethan 1,500 local governments, school districts and communitycolleges have taken steps to identify or eliminate race or sex biasin the wages of civil service employees.   Cities, counties and school districts in 24 states and theDistrict of Columbia have taken some action to address the issue ofpay equity, the report said.   ``Americans are rejecting compensation systems that unfairlypenalize women and people of color,'' Eileen M. Stein, chairwomanof the Washington-based coalition of women's, labor and civilrights groups, said in a statement accompanying the report.   ``It is indisputable that pay equity is taking hold at the localand state levels,'' she said. ``Employer by employer, jurisdictionby jurisdiction, race and sex discrimination will be removed aswage determinants.''   Pay equity, also known as comparable worth, is the concept ofpaying men and women similar wages for different jobs judged to beof equal value to an employer. Supporters of the concept say actionis needed to offset historical discrimination that has depressedwages in job fields dominated by women, such as teaching, nursingand clerical work.   Opponents say it is impossible to compare jobs as disparate as,say, nursing and truck driving.   Stein pointed to recent victories for pay equity proponents,such as the $35 million decision by the city of San Francisco lastMarch to give 12,000 city and school employees raises of $750 to$2,000 a year over two years.   The city acted after its civil service commission found thatfemale and minority municipal workers were paid an average of 42percent less than their male counterparts in similar jobs.   The year before, Washington state adjusted the wages of about35,000 state workers in a program that could cost about $482million through 1992.   Stein also said Los Angeles, Chicago, Seattle, Colorado Springs,Colo.; West Hartford, Conn.; Ann Arbor, Mich.; Spokane, Wash.;Sioux City, Iowa; Palo Alto, Calif.; Long Beach, Calif.; Green Bay,Wis.; Virginia Beach, Va.; and Burlington, Vt., have made payequity adjustments.   Pay equity proponents in Congress have been unsuccesful so farin attempts to pass legislation requiring the government to studyits wage and job classification systems for possible discrimination.   To date, no federal appeals court has ruled that employers mustpay similar salaries to workers in jobs of comparable worthalthough some employers are undertaking such salary revisions ontheir own.</TEXT></DOC>
