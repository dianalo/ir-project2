On other markets, precious metals mostly were lower; livestockand meat futures moved sharply higher; energy futures were mixed;grains and soybeans were mixed; and stock-index futures fell.   Copper settled 1 cent to 4.40 cents lower on the CommodityExchange with the spot contract for delivery in December at $1.585 apound and the more actively traded March contract at $1.352 a pound.   Daily increases in the amount of warehoused copper registeredwith the Commodity Exchange have been rare since October 1987, whenthe Comex copper inventory stood at nearly 90,000 short tons.   Late last week, the exchange reported that warehouse stocks haddropped to 5,204 tons and copper for December delivery on theexchange soared to an all-time high of $1.6475 a pound.   But copper traders who had expected the trend to continue wereshocked Monday morning when the Comex reported that warehouse stockshad risen to 6,545 tons, a 24 percent increase from last week'stally.   ``That was an unpleasant surprise to the market,'' said CraigSloane, metals analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. in NewYork.   The Comex last reported an increase in copper stocks on Nov. 17.   Meanwhile, the world's other major copper futures market, theLondon Metal Exchange, reported a 1,925-ton decline in its warehousestocks of copper, which was a smaller decrease than traders hadexpected, Sloane said.   Platinum futures prices fell sharply in a technically inspiredsell-off, dragging a gold prices lower as well, but silver futureswere mixed, analysts said.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum settled $8.60 to$11.10 lower with January at $589.10 a troy ounce. On the Comex,gold settled $2.80 to $3.10 lower with February at $424.60 a troyounce; silver was 0.7 cent lower to 0.4 cent higher with March at$6.298 a troy ounce.   Pork futures rose strongly on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange onspeculation that last week's drop in slaughters meant hog kills hadpassed their seasonal peak, said Dale Durchholz, an analyst withAgri-Visor Services Inc., Bloomington, Ill.   Strong retail demand and the arrival of wintry conditions in theMidwest also contributed to the advance in pork futures, he said.   ``Farmers just havent' been willing to move hogs with the kind oftemperatures we've had because it stresses them a little more,''Durchholz said.   Cattle futures rallied in sympathy with the pork complex and inreaction to renewed demand, he said.   Live cattle settled .25 cent to .60 cent higher with December at72.42 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .50 cent to 1 cent higherwith January at 83.95 cents a pound; live hogs were .63 cent to 1.20cents higher with December at 42.77 cents a pound; frozen porkbellies were 1.03 cent to 1.35 cent higher with February at 44.60cents a pound.   Home heating oil prices closed sharply higher and lent support tocrude oil futures after sub-zero temperatures hit the Northeast,analysts said. Gasoline futures retreated.   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 3 cents 22 cents higherwith January at $16.06 a barrel; heating oil was .10 cent to .70cent higher with January at 50.20 cents a gallon; unleaded gasolinewas .11 cent to .40 cent lower with January at 44.20 cents a gallon.   Grain futures finished higher on the Chicago Board of Trade amidrumors of impending grain sales to the Soviet Union while soybeanprices settled mostly lower in response to weekend rains in SouthAmerica.   The Agriculture Department issued a monthly grain supply-demandreport after the close in which it increased its estimate for theU.S. wheat stockpile at the end of the current marketing year to 533million bushels from 528 million bushels.   Wheat settled 1{ cents to 3{ cents higher with December at $4.28{a bushel; corn was 1{ cents to 4} cents higher with December at$2.61{ a bushel; oats were 1} cents to 5{ cents higher with Decemberat $2.07{ a bushel; soybeans were 4\ cents lower to 4} cents higherwith January at $7.69\ a bushel.
