The whales have been stranded 18 miles northeast of Barrow bynew ice for more than a week. They are in shallow water only a fewhundred feet offshore. The three _ an adult and two smaller whales_ have been rising to the surface every four minutes or so tobreath through two 15-by-30-foot breaks in the ice.   They are five miles from open water.   Biologists this week said they feared the breathing holes couldfreeze over or be slammed shut by shifting ice.   ``But the sea-ice vectors and sea-ice analysis show there issome hope,'' said Ron Morris, the fisheries service's field officesupervisor in Anchorage. ``We're not closed in for the winter withpressure ridges and things haven't gotten to the point where it'sall gloom and doom.   ``We're not in the position where they are going to go belly up.They are not that stressed.''   He said a 96-hour forecast showed a strong potential for icemovement parallel to the Arctic coast. ``There is the possibilitythat this ice will move and open up,'' he said.   An ice analysis showed that only 70 percent of the ocean in thewhales' immediate vicinity was frozen, he said. Much of the ice isnew, and is 6 to 8 inches thick.   Geoff Carroll, a wildlife biologist from the North SlopeBorough, flew over the California gray whales Thursday. He said heplanned to use a snowmobile to reach them late Friday.   ``We're going to use hydrophones to try to record sounds fromthe whales and perhaps use that later on as an attracting device toget them to open water,'' he said. ``We're coming up with severaldifferent schemes for knocking holes in the ice.''   One option is the use of explosives to blow holes in the ice;another involves the use of an ice-breaking Hovercraft at PrudhoeBay, some 210 miles southeast of the whales, he said. Efforts toobtain the services of an icebreaker were unsuccessful by Fridayafternoon.   ``That's where it stands right now. There's nothing definite,''he said.   Carroll said bowhead whales, which grow up to 60 feet long,would be able to break through the relatively thin ice, and thatthe slightly smaller gray whales, at 40-50 feet, might be able toalso if they left their tiny patch of open water.   ``Bowhead are used to it; they've got more mass; they're biggeraround,'' Carroll said. ``They have their blowhole way up on top ofa big bow on their head. I'm sure these whales could push upthrough. There's plenty of mass and strength.   ``I just don't know if they would apply the force. They'veprobably never done it before. They spend their winters in sunnyCalifornia. They aren't used to being up here in the arctic ice,''Carroll said.   The whales' prospects for survival would be bleak if theirbreathing holes closed and they could not force their way to thesurface.   ``If the ice pushed in and closed the hole they might be able tohold out for a half-hour or an hour. If they already are exhausedthey are not going to last very long,'' Carroll said.   The population of endangered California gray whales numbersabout 20,000 and has been growing at an annual average of 2.5percent for the past decade.</TEXT></DOC>
