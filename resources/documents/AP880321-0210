Both Nicaragua and the Contras proposed cease-fires in talksMonday.   The border region remained tense, with Honduran patrols on thelookout for any booby traps left behind by the Sandinistas.   President Jose Azcona Hoyo said the 3,200 U.S. troops sent toHonduras last week, after the Nicaraguan army was accused ofsending 2,000 men across the border in pursuit of Contras, may notbe needed any longer.   ``The worst is over and there is peace now in the borderregion,'' Col. Reynald Andino Flores, commander of the Honduranarmy's 101st Infantry Brigade, said by telephone from hisheadquarters in southern Honduras.   ``We are remaining on a state of alert to be ready for anythingthat may happen,'' he added, and soldiers are ``constantlypatrolling the area.''   Flores and other officers, some of whom insisted on anonymityfor security reasons, said the Sandinistas penetrated an area ofabout 20 square miles inside Olancho province while chasing theU.S.-supported rebels in a two-week offensive to evict the Contrasfrom Nicaragua.   About 200 border incidents have been reported in Olancho sincethe Contras began fighting the leftist Sandinista government in1981.   President Daniel Ortega and the Nicaraguan government havedenied Sandinista soldiers crossed the border.   The Contras maintain camps in an area called Bocay, whichincludes territory on both sides of the border. Nicaragua claimsthe camps, which the Contras use to store supplies and to stageraids inside Nicaragua, are in Nicaraguan land but the rebels saythey are in Honduras.   At Nicaragua's request, a U.N. fact-finding team will leave forNicaragua Tuesday to investigate the border violence, the UnitedNations announced in a statement. It said observations will belimited to the Nicaragua side, since no permission was receivedfrom Honduras to go there.   At Sapoa, a town on the Costa Rican border, representatives ofthe Sandinista government and Contras held their first direct talksMonday on Nicaraguan soil.   At the conclusion of the first day of talks, both sides saidthey presented cease-fire proposals and agreed to stop fightingthrough the three-day negotiations.   ``Neither side seeks a military victory over the other,'' saidAlfredo Cesar, head of the rebel delegation.   Cesar told reporters the Contras proposed a 30-day cease-fire,continuous talks to reach a truce, a total amnesty and guaranteesof free expression to lead toward reconciliation. He called thetalks, which were behind closed doors, ``a step ahead.''   Defense Minister Humberto Ortega, leader of the governmentdelegation, said he proposed an ``immediate and definitivecease-fire.'' He did not elaborate.   Sending four battalions of the 82nd Airborne Division and 7thLight Infantry to Honduras brought the U.S. military presence inHonduras to more than 6,000 men. They are engaged in jointexercises with the Hondurans, but away from the border combat area.   U.S. and Honduran units have held joint exercises every fewmonths for the last five years.   Some of the American troops practiced military maneuvers at anairstrip only 20 miles from the Nicaraguan border on Sunday. A U.S.Army transport helicopter crashed during an exercise farther fromthe border, injuring all 10 U.S. soldiers aboard, Pentagonspokesmen said in Washington.   The UH-1 Huey helicopter crashed Monday afternoon nearJuticalpa, Honduras, said Maj. Gary Hovatter, spokesman for theAmerican forces sent to Honduras last week.   Last Thursday and Saturday, Honduran jets bombed Sandinistapositions in the Bocay region, 145 miles east of Tegucigalpa. OneHonduran officer said the planes were sent because the Nicaraguans``were not moving out fast enough.''   He said the Honduran military had strengthened patrols along theill-defined 500-mile frontier with Nicaragua and Honduran jets wereconducting daily observation flights.   Azcona said Sunday that, ``If there are no more incidents, theAmericans will leave.'' On Monday, he told The Associated Press:``Honduras does not desire war but our armed forces are remainingon a state of alert and conducting at least two air reconnaissanceflights daily.''   When the soldiers were sent to Honduras last week, U.S.officials said they would be here about 10 days.   A Honduran military source said Monday there were ``very fewNicaraguan soldiers in our territory. Our air reconnaissancecarried out this morning showed it.''   In Washington, the focus turned to a renewed debate over U.S.aid to the Contras. The Reagan administration indicated support fora new $48 million proposal advanced by a bipartisan group ofsenators.   It would include funds to pay for delivery of up to $2.5 millionin previously authorized military aid.</TEXT></DOC>
