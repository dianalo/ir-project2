(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Lisa Day-CopelandandM;A key indication of significant changes in both the American workplace andthe microcomputer market is that the number of computer keyboards at thenation's work establishments has surpassed the number of desk-based workersin the United States.andM;Data from a series of annual surveys conducted each January by COMTEC MarketAnalysis Services, a subsidiary of market researcher Gartner Group Inc. inStamford, Conn., indicates that a milestone in the evolution of end-usercomputing has been passed.andP;  These surveys are based on a national sample ofmore than 8,000 non-farm, non-residential workplaces.andP;  They form the basis ofCOMTEC's annual Personal Computer Reports.andM;COMTEC's definition of a keyboard unit includes text processors (such asdedicated CRT word processors and manual, electric and electronictypewriters), non-intelligent CRTs and PCs.andP;  Based on this definition,COMTEC's 1989 survey found that there were 43.06 million keyboard units inthe United States as of the start of 1989, up 7 percent from 40.23 millionkeyboards a year earlier.andM;During the same period, desk workers -- defined in the COMTEC survey aswhite-collar employees working at a desk in an office environment -- in theUnited States increased by 2.2 percent, rising from 39.51 million in 1988 to40.39 million in 1989.andP;  This indicates that there are currently 1.07keyboards per desk worker, compared with 1.02 in 1988 and 0.94 in 1987.andM;The significance of this development for the PC market is that anincreasingly larger share of micro sales will need to be replacements forexisting text processors, non-intelligent CRTs or PCs.andP;  COMTEC's data showsthat in 1984, 40 percent of desk workers had no keyboard of any type --making them fair game for all desktop-computer equipment makers.andM;The good news for PC makers is that the proportion of keyboard units that arePCs continues to rise rapidly.andP;  COMTEC's 1989 survey shows that PCs currentlyaccount for one-third of all keyboard units in workplaces, up from 22.6percent in 1987 and only 5.9 percent in 1984.andM;Despite healthy gains for PCs in shareandM;of the desktop-computing market, the growth rate for the total number of PCsinstalled in workplaces slowed to 23.4 percent between 1988 and 1989.andP;  Thiswas down significantly from 44.2 percent between 1987 and 1988, and 48percent between 1986 and 1987.andP;  This declining growth rate for PCs reflectsthe saturation of the desktop market as a whole.andM;Growth of Communicating PCsandM;Interestingly, the growth rate for communicating PCs -- defined by COMTEC asPCs on a LAN or attached to another computer system -- was 40.2 percentbetween 1988 and 1989, while the growth rate for non-communicating PCsamounted to only 13.3 percent during the same period.andM;In fact, an analysis of the six waves of COMTEC data suggests thatmicro-based connectivity-related hardware, software and services are likelyto experience significant growth now and in the future.andM;The results of the latest survey show that the proportion of micros networkedin any fashion is rising rapidly.andP;  According to COMTEC, 42.4 percent ofmicros were networked in 1989, compared with 30.3 percent in 1987 and 12percent in 1984.andM;The share of keyboard units accounted for by non-intelligent CRT terminalswas 25.7 percent in 1989, up slightly from 24.9 percent in 1987 and 17.6percent in 1984.andP;  The surveys indicate significant declines for textprocessors, which accounted for 41.3 percent of total keyboard units in 1989,down from 52.5 percent in 1987 and 76.5 percent in 1984.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
