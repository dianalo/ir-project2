Tutu, the first black to head the Anglican Church in SouthAfrica, was completing a U.S. tour where he appealed for additionalU.S. economic sanctions to protest South Africa's apartheidpolicies.   ``Archbishop Tutu has never been voted into a public office thatgives him the right to claim a significant constituency,'' theSouth African Broadcasting Corp. said in a commentary.   The statement failed to note that Tutu, like all of the nation's26 million blacks, is ineligible to vote or be elected to nationalpolitical office.   The SABC also said, without elaborating, that the AnglicanChurch ``is deeply divided as a result of his (Tutu's) politicalutterances.''   ``What is the church's stand on the widely held view thatsanctions will bring deprivation and hardship in increasing numbersto black South Africans?'' the SABC asked.   ``The church owes it not only to parishoners but to all SouthAfricans to state unequivocally where the church stands onsanctions, disinvestments, and their consequences.''   Anglican Church officials could not be reached for commentdespite repeated telephone calls to their offices.   The government has attacked Tutu in harsh tones on a number ofissues. In March, President P.W. Botha sent a letter to Tutu andother church leaders saying they ``love and embrace'' the outlawedAfrican National Congress guerrilla group.   ``You embrace and participate in their call for violence,hatred, sanctions, insurrection and revolution,'' Botha said.   Tutu, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize, has continued tocall for sanctions and other forms of international pressure as themost likely ways to bring about race reform in South Africa.   The U.S. Congress imposed limited sanctions against South Africain 1986, banning the import of selected goods and stopping directair links between the two countries. Congress now is consideringmuch tougher legislation that would ban almost all bilateraleconomic activity.   Under apartheid, a racially segregated society is established bylaw and custom, with the 5 million whites controlling the economyand maintaining separate districts, schools and health services.</TEXT></DOC>
