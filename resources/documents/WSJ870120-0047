A dozen years ago he ran as the moderate in a four-way race for the Republican gubernatorial nomination in Wyoming. Today Sen. Malcolm Wallop, once one of the great unknowns of the Senate, is emerging as one of the next superstars of the right.    Now the man who once was overshadowed by his Wyoming colleague Alan Simpson, the GOP whip, is a candidate to head the Central Intelligence Agency and is winning the strongest accolades of the right. &quot;The Winston Churchill of his time,&quot; says Sen. William Armstrong of Colorado, a leading conservative Republican. &quot;The principal anti-communist geo-strategic spokesman in the Senate,&quot; says Howard Phillips, chairman of the Conservative Caucus.    &quot;My gosh,&quot; asks Richard Viguerie, a New Right leader, &quot;where has this guy come from?&quot;    This change in Malcolm Wallop has been occurring since his first days here, far from the cattle and horses on his ranch in a northern Wyoming town called Big Horn. But the pace has accelerated from a gentle canter in 1977 to a furious gallop in recent years, and now he is the darling of hard-line conservatives and a source of bewilderment to some of his Capitol Hill colleagues.    Lawmakers often adjust their positions in the course of a congressional career, but usually these changes take the form of midcourse corrections that prompt a legislator to drift into one ideological camp or another. Seldom do they catapult a political figure onto a fringe on the ideological spectrum, as Sen. Wallop's transformation has done.    &quot;It's not only the positions he takes but the vehemence of them that surprises us,&quot; says a Democratic lawmaker who regularly opposes Mr. Wallop. Sen. Simpson, who served with Mr. Wallop in the Wyoming Legislature, notes: &quot;He burns with a passion unalloyed.&quot;    Today Sen. Wallop luxuriates in being one of the early backers of a laser antimissile defense and is pressing for early deployment of the Strategic Defense Initiative. He appears on the dais at conservative dinners along with former chief United Nations delegate Jeane Kirkpatrick, Sen. Jesse Helms (R., N.C.) and Patrick Buchanan, the White House communications director. He's regarded as a comrade-in-arms of Rep. Jack Kemp, who is seeking the GOP presidential nomination. He has even criticized President Reagan for paying &quot;ransom&quot; to the Soviet Union to win the release of U.S. News andamp; World Report correspondent Nicholas Daniloff.    &quot;A lot of people go to Washington and become liberals,&quot; says Tyler Dodge, a Wallop admirer in the Wyoming ranching community of Wheatland. &quot;He absolutely didn't do that.&quot;    The lawmaker from Wyoming who is making a reputation as a maverick from the right in Washington once was a maverick of an entirely different sort in the state Legislature in Cheyenne.    &quot;He wasn't a conservative in the early days,&quot; says Kendall Stewart, a political activist who worked with him in the 1970s. He was, instead, a strong environmentalist, &quot;wildly independent,&quot; in the words of another former associate, from the rest of the state's Republicans.    &quot;His switch has been quite dramatic, and people seem to like it out here,&quot; says Oliver Walter, a political scientist at the University of Wyoming. &quot;You don't run the risk of being undercut in Wyoming by becoming more conservative.&quot;    Mr. Wallop, whose ancestors include a British lord, was born in New York City and educated at Yale and didn't come to hard-line conservatism naturally. From a generally moderate Republican, he moved to the genteel conservatism of his forebears and then even farther to the right.    This transformation began with the education of Malcolm Wallop in the Senate Intelligence Committee in 1977. &quot;The more I examined,&quot; he says, &quot;the more unsettled I became that conventional wisdom was costing this country.&quot;    Mr. Wallop, from a state that is home to MX and Minuteman missile installations, began to examine his assumptions about arms control (it was &quot;good,&quot; he thought) and about the Soviets (who could be contained, he thought). He came to believe that the U.S. was more eager to explain away Soviet behavior than to influence it -- or stop it.    &quot;We are naive because we refuse to examine what the Soviet Union is,&quot; he says. &quot;We refuse to examine what arms control failed to do even before World War II. We fail to see the Soviets' relentless push to expand their horizons. It's been going on steadily since World War II and we're constantly looking for an excuse for them.&quot;    Mr. Wallop was having little impact in his Senate work on domestic issues; he's a traditional conservative whose accomplishments were modest and concentrated in the areas of public lands and resource management. He even confused expensing for intangible drilling costs with the oil depletion allowance during the consideration of tax overhaul.    But his pebbles in the pond of foreign and defense policy began causing ripples. People began to notice Malcolm Wallop.    A vigorous defender of aid to the Nicaraguan rebels, he once argued that Americans &quot;don't have the stomach for helping people fight for freedom.&quot; He emerged as a leading advocate for deploying the MX missile. And he opposed continued U.S. adherence to the SALT II agreement, which never was ratified.    &quot;The SALT agreements have not constrained the Soviet buildup,&quot; he said in a floor speech during the June debate over the arms accord. &quot;The few weapons they have had to dismantle were literally junk compared with the modern systems that replaced them.&quot;    Then during the debate over sanctions against South Africa, Sen. Wallop raised the specter of communist control of the region. He argued that a Soviet base in South Africa would &quot;cut us off from secure links to the Indian Ocean and prevent shipment of oil to the West&quot; past the Cape of Good Hope.    Mr. Wallop, for years somewhat ill at ease in the Senate, has found a role and a new set of political allies. He's espousing views he calls &quot;peculiarly anti-social&quot; and is finding sociability in doing so.    &quot;I'm a rancher with a feed lot and I have an open microphone,&quot; he says. &quot;I'm having a great time.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
