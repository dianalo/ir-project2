LEDERER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Government forces pushed backguerrilla fighters and took new territory near a stategic easterncity during fighting that killed 68 people, the Foreign Ministrysaid Wednesday.   After nearly daily rocket barrages for a month, Kabul was quietfor the second day as government forces rounded up suspectedguerrilla sympathizers and seized weapons in the capital area, saidForeign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani.   On Tuesday, the government said 100 rockets were confiscated inthe area and 50 people were arrested. Amani said Wednesday thatthree Egyptian Sakr-30 surface-to-surface rockets also were foundabout 15 miles east of Kabul.   Earlier Wednesday, about 200 Moslem religious leaders and theirfollowers demonstrated in Kabul to protest the rocket attacks. Theyblamed them on the United States and Pakistan, which supply weaponsto the guerrillas.   In Nangarhar province, government forces drove back guerrillasfighters and seized new territory, Amani said. The provincialcapital is Jalalabad, an eastern city that the guerrillas havetwice failed to capture in offensives since Soviet soldierswithdrew in February.   Amani said fighting in Nangarhar province in the last 24 hourshad left 62 guerrillas dead and 93 wounded. He said six governmentsoldiers were killed and 12 wounded.   In operations east of Samar Khel, about 12 miles southeast ofJalalabad, government forces conducted search operations. Largequantities of arms and ammunition were seized near Chapar Hardistrict, Amani said. He gave no numbers.   ``The general condition of the war in Chapar Har and Samar Khelis that the enemy is retreating,'' Amani said. ``But they arebacked by the heavy artillery of the 11th Division of the Pakistaniarmed forces.''   Neighboring Pakistan, which allows the guerrillas to be based onits territory, denies it is fighting with them in the decade-oldcivil war.   There was no independent confirmation of any of Amani's reports.   Amani also reported heavy clashes between supporters of rivalguerrilla groups in Tutum Dara in Parwan province north of Kabul.He said there were ``a lot of casualties,'' but he gave no numbers.   Among the groups involved was Hezb-e-islami and Jamiat-e-islami,he said.   The two fundamentalist groups have reportedly been engaged in apower struggle recently. Guerrilla sources have said Hezbsupporters ambushed Jamiat forces on July 9 in the north and killed30 of their fighters.   The reported battles between the groups has raised new questionsabout the ability of the guerrillas to overthrow the Marxistgovernment in Kabul.   In Kabul, the Moslem leaders and their supporters demonstratedoutside the U.N. Good Offices Mission.   ``American imperialists, die!'' they shouted while a small groupof protesters shook and banged the metal gates at the entrance toU.N. office.   The U.N. office was established to help oversee the Sovietwithdrawal. U.N. officials are also supposed to help thegovernments of Afghanistan and Pakistan cut off arms supplies toboth sides of the war.   Since June 25, more than 280 people have been killed and 745injured in the rocket attacks and a car bombing in the Kabul area.</TEXT></DOC>
