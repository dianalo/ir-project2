Jim Slattery (D., Kan.), said of the action bythe Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee.</LP><TEXT>   The Bush administration and many large banks complain thatthe panel's limits on dealings between affiliated banks andbrokers are so rigid that they will discourage banks fromentering the securities business. Republicans failed in alast-minute effort to soften a provision designed to preventa bank from lending to a client that is selling sharesthrough an affiliated securities firm.   The adoption of provisions authored by Rep. Edward Markey(D., Mass.), the subcommittee's chairman, and Rep. JohnDingell (D., Mich.), chairman of the full committee, is asetback for the Bush administration. The Treasury hasproposed a bank-restructuring plan that would expand theability of banks to compete with brokerage and insurancecompanies.   &quot;This bill is simply a rollback from where we are today,&quot;said Treasury Undersecretary Robert Glauber. &quot;What we havebefore us is a bill that is really anticompetitive&quot; becauseit would limit some of the powers banks currently have toprovide insurance and securities services, he said. If thesubcommittee's approach prevails, bankers and Treasuryofficials said they won't be able to support this portion ofa broad banking bill.   However, banking legislation is far from complete. Bankingcommittees in the House and the Senate have passed sweepingbills to augment the bank deposit insurance fund, tightenbank regulation, limit federal reimbursement of deposits over$100,000, allow banks to branch nationwide, and open the wayfor banks to combine with securities firms. The full Energyand Commerce Committee will take up the bill next week, anddifferences between the House banking and commercecommittees' versions will be fought out on the House floor.   The breadth of the Treasury's proposal has triggered aferocious fight between banks and their rivals -- insurancecompanies, brokerage firms and mutual funds, all of whom wantto fend off new competition.   In the morning, the consumer protection subcommittee ofthe Energy and Commerce Committee adopted provisions thatwould restrict existing provisions that allow banks in smalltowns to sell insurance and roll back a Federal Reserve Boardruling that would enable Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank tounderwrite and sell insurance nationwide from affiliates inDelaware.   In the afternoon, the finance subcommittee took upsecurities provisions. The meeting was delayed for nearly twohours as Republicans and Democrats tried to soften aprovision that would bar banks from making any loans tocustomers of a securities affiliate for 90 days after anunderwriting. In the end, committee members, the Treasury andrepresentatives of brokers and banks couldn't agree onlanguage to soften this so-called firewall designed toprevent conflicts of interest between banks and affiliatedbrokers.   On another issue, Mr. Dingell strongly opposes theadministration's proposal to allow commercial companies toown banks. Panel Republicans offered a compromise proposal toallow commercial companies to purchase failing banks as a wayof reducing the drain on the deposit insurance fund, but thesubcommittee rejected the amendment on a vote of 15-11 infavor of leaving the current complete ban on banking andcommerce in place.</TEXT></DOC>
