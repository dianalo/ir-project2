The case, in state court in Los Angeles, will determinethe fate of assets in the insolvency and uphold or overturnCalifornia Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi's positionthat Executive Life's obligation to the bondholders ranksjunior to its traditional insurance contracts.</LP><TEXT>   A victory by the bond claimants would sharply reducerecoveries for large insurance policies and pose greaterdemands on state insurance guaranty funds, as limited assetswould be used to cover a further $1.85 billion in liabilitiesthat barely enter into current workout proposals. LosAngeles-based Executive Life is the one-time principalinsurance unit of First Executive Corp., which itself is nowin Chapter 11 bankruptcy law proceedings.   Analysts say that a bondholders' victory also could morethan double the value of the bonds themselves. The securitiescurrently trade for as little as 20 cents on the dollar andstand to recover almost nothing under the insurancecommissioners' current plan.   The so-called &quot;muni-GICs&quot; have been the focus of a bitterdebate for months, with assertions of bad faith from bothsides in the scramble to cover about $9.87 billion inliabilities with assets estimated to be worth roughly $3billion less.   California regulators contend that the bond litigation isa selfish attack on scarce assets by the bond trustees andsecurities underwriters, who face claims from bondholders inseparate litigation. &quot;These people are trying to take moneythat is in trust for {Executive Life's} policyholders andbail themselves out of liabilities to bondholders,&quot; assertsKarl Rubinstein, special counsel to California's insurancecommissioner, adding that &quot;their position would bedevastating to policyholders around the country.&quot;   For their part, bond advocates argue that the position ofMr. Garamendi, California's first elected insurancecommissioner, is colored by political bias and ambition,noting that most bond holders neither live nor vote inCalifornia, while many major insurance policyholders do. &quot;Wesee this as a political opinion,&quot; says Julio Herrera, ananalyst at RRH Capital Management, New York, investmentadvisers with clients who have invested in the bonds.   Central to the case is whether the so-called &quot;fundingagreements&quot; governing money from the bonds are a part ofExecutive Life's conventional insurance business or amiscellaneous claim against the company's assets.   Lawyers for the bond underwriters assert that the fundingagreements are in principal the same as variouscompany-issued annuities. If the court is to set aside themuni-GICs, these lawyers argue, then it must set aside nearly$5 billion of other claims, including annuities bought bycorporate pension funds and used to provide for victims inpersonal injury cases.   Lawyers for Texas Commerce Bank-El Paso, a unit ofChemical Banking Corp., New York, and trustees for one bondissue, take a somewhat different tack. They argue thatbondholder claims aren't governed by California law but byTexas law, where the funding agreements recently were deemeda conventional insurance product.   Mr. Rubinstein, special counsel to the commissioner,retorts that the assertion of Texas law &quot;is a product of theLooney Toons studio in Hollywood.&quot;   The tale of the muni-GICs began with the sale in 1986 ofjust seven issues of the unorthodox bonds by municipalagencies in Tennessee, Texas, Louisiana, Nebraska, andColorado. There were multiple issues in Louisiana and Texas.Although technically intended as borrowings by the municipalagencies for government purposes, the monies went directlyinto funding agreements at Executive Life, where they couldbe withdrawn by the municipalities only under the mostonerous terms. According to court documents, just $6 millionof the $1.85 billion in muni-GICs was ever drawn forgovernment purposes. Executive Life, in turn, invested muchof the money in junk bonds. Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., thefailed investment banking concern and former employer ofnow-jailed junk-bond king Michael Milken, played a pivotalrole in all but one of the bond issues.   California insurance regulators contend that the bondswere in effect an illegitimate ruse that converted Triple-Abond borrowings into fodder for the burgeoning junk-bondmarket. &quot;The underlying transactions are a scandal ofunprecedented proportions,&quot; says the state's insurancedepartment in a brief to the court. State officials arguethat the bondholders' proper route for recovery is throughthe extensive civil fraud actions now consolidated in federalcourt in New Orleans.</TEXT></DOC>
