Field of the Invention </PAR><PAR>  The present invention relates to a molding assembly for an automobile      window plate, which includes an elongate ornamental molding member or      trimming member secured to the automobile body panel to cover a gap      between the body panel and upper and side edges of the window plate. </PAR><PAR>  2. Description of the Related Art </PAR><PAR>  An automobile generally employs various kinds of window molding members      which extend along the periphery of front or rear window plate, i.e. along      a pair of front or rear pillars and the front or rear edge of the roof      panel of the automobile body. The window molding member typically includes      upper and side portions to extend along the upper and side edges of a      window plate, respectively, and a corner portion between the upper and      side portions for connecting them with each other. </PAR><PAR>  A variety of requirements are imposed on window molding members mainly from      design and/or functional viewpoint. For example, Japanese Utility Model      Application Publication No. 57-54,416 discloses a window molding member      including a profiled metal body whose tip end is provided with a ridge      composed of appropriate synthetic resin material. The ridge defines a weir      which serves, during driving in rainy conditions, to prevent rain water on      the window plate from flowing across the side portion of the molding      member toward the side window, thereby preserving the driver's and/or      navigator's sight through the side windows. However, the ridge along the      upper portion of the molding member disturbs formation of a so-called      flush outer surface of the automobile body along the front edge of the      roof panel, i.e. along the upper portion of the molding member. </PAR><PAR>  This led to an increased demand in the automobile industry for a much      improved window molding member whose cross-sectional shape varies in the      longitudinal direction as disclosed, inter alia, in Japanese Utility Model      Application Laid-open Publication No. 63-184,117 and U.S. Pat. Nos.      4,757,659 and 4,757,660 to Miyakawa et al. Such a molding member is      essentially composed of an extruded synthetic resin body including an      upper portion of a first predetermined cross-section for achieving a flush      outer surface of the automobile body along the upper portion, and at least      one side portion of a second predetermined cross-section for defining the      weir. </PAR><PAR>  From ornamental viewpoint, it is sometimes desirable to use a molding      member composed of a profiled metal member, though formation of the weir      along the side portion while achieving a flush outer surface along the      upper portion generally necessitates deformation of the metal member,      which is often difficult without the sacrifice of a refined appearance of      the molding member in its smoothness and continuity at the corner portion      between the upper and side portions. This is particularly the case when      the automobile body panel at the side portion is significantly higher than      the body panel at the upper portion. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved      automobile window molding assembly, which affords a weir along the side      portion while achieving a flush outer surface along the upper portion,      including an elongate ornamental member composed of a profiled metal      member with a refined appearance in smoothness and continuity at the      corner portion despite difference in height of the automobile body panel      at the upper and side portions. </PAR><PAR>  To this end, according to the present invention, there is provided an      automobile window molding assembly comprising: an elongate outer      ornamental member or trimming member formed of a profiled metal member      which is adapted to cover a gap between an automobile body panel and upper      and side edges of a window plate mounted on the body panel; said      ornamental member including upper and side portions to extend along the      upper and side edges of a window plate, respectively, and a corner portion      between the upper and side portions for integrally connecting them with      each other; said ornamental member having such a predetermined profile      that, when the assembly is mounted in place, the ornamental member is in      abutment with an outer surface of the window plate along the upper portion      while it is spaced from the outer surface of the window plate along the      side portion; fastener means for securing the ornamental member to the      body panel; and a weir member secured to the ornamental member along the      side portion to define a weir between the outer surface of the window      plate and the ornamental member along the side portion. </PAR><PAR>  In the automobile window molding assembly according to the present      invention, the profiled metal member forming the outer ornamental member      or trimming member may be composed of a stainless steel sheet, aluminum      sheet or the like, which has been subjected to bending by a roll forming      machine into the desired cross-section, for example, or it may be a rod of      aluminum or the like metal which has been extruded into the desired      cross-section. If necessary or desired, such a profiled metal member may      be supplied to an extrusion die to be coextruded with a synthetic resin,      or it may be fixedly connected to an elongate shaped body of a synthetic      resin. The weir member secured to the ornamental member to define the weir      may be composed of either a similar profiled metal member or a shaped body      of a synthetic resin. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a perspective view of an automobile which includes a window      molding assembly according to the present invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is an exploded perspective view of the window molding assembly      according to one preferred embodiment of the present invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a perspective view of the window molding assembly of FIG. 2,      which is mounted in place; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is an exploded perspective view showing the side portion of the      assembly of FIG. 1 in an enlarged scale; </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 5, 6 and 7 are cross-sectional views taken along the lines V--V,      VI--VI and VII--VII in FIG. 4, respectively; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 8 is a cross-sectional view showing the upper portion of the assembly      of FIG. 1; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 9 is an exploded perspective view of the window molding assembly      according to another embodiment of the present invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 10 is a perspective view of the window molding assembly of FIG. 9,      which is mounted in place; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 11 is a cross-sectional view taken along the line XI--XI in FIG. 9; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 12 is an exploded perspective view of the window molding assembly      according to another embodiment of the present invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 13 is a perspective view of the window molding assembly of FIG. 12,      which is mounted in place; </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 14 and 15 are cross-sectional views taken along the lines XIV--XIV      and XV--XV in FIG. 13, respectively; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 16 is a cross-sectional view similar to FIG. 14, showing a      modification of the window molding assembly of FIGS. 12 to 15; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 17 is a perspective view of the window molding assembly according to      still another embodiment of the present invention, which is mounted in      place; </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 18, 19 and 20 are cross-sectional views taken along the lines      XVIII--XVIII, XIX--XIX and XX--XX, respectively; </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 21 and 22 are perspective views showing the fastener member in the      embodiment of FIG. 17; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 23 is a perspective view showing the cushion element in the embodiment      of FIG. 17; </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 24 and 25 are perspective views showing the mounting clip in the      embodiment of FIG. 17; and </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 26 is a fragmentary side view showing a modification of the window      molding assembly of FIGS. 17 to 25. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED EXPLANATION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </PAC><PAR>  The present invention will now be explained in further detail by referring      to some preferred embodiments shown in the attached drawings, wherein the      same reference numerals are used to denote the same or functionally      equivalent components. </PAR><PAR>  There is shown in FIG. 1 an automobile which is designated as a whole by      reference numeral 1, and which includes a front window plate 2 and side      window plates 3. The front window plate 2 may be composed of a transparent      inorganic glass or transparent synthetic resin, such as polycarbonate      resin, acrylic resin or the like, and is associated with a window molding      assembly 4 to which the present invention is applied. </PAR><PAR>  As particularly shown in FIGS. 5, 6 and 8, the window molding assembly 4 is      arranged to cover a gap between the automobile body panel 5 and the      peripheral edge of the front window plate 2. The front window plate 2 is      secured to a depressed flange or seat portion 5a of the body panel 5 by      means of an adhesive material 6, with a rubber dam member 7 between the      window plate 2 and the seat portion 5a of the body panel 5. The window      plate 2 may be provided on its rear surface with an opaque printed layer      extending along the periphery of the plate 2 to visually conceal the      adhesive material 6 and the dam member 7 from outside and thereby realize      a refined appearance. </PAR><PAR>  The molding assembly 4 of the embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 2 to 8      consists of an upper portion 8 and side portions 9 extending along the      upper and side edges of the window plate 2, respectively, and corner      portions 10 for integrally connecting the upper and side portions 8, 9      with each other. In this connection, the body panel 5 has a height which      is higher at the side portions 9 than at the upper portion 8, as      appreciated from a comparison of FIGS. 5 and 6 with FIG. 8. </PAR><PAR>  The molding assembly 4 includes an outer ornamental member or trimming      member 11 in the form of an elongate profiled metal member, having an      imaginary reference plane which corresponds to the outer surface of the      window plate 2. The profiled metal member forming the outer ornamental      member 11 is composed of a stainless steel sheet, aluminum sheet or the      like, which has been subjected to bending by a roll forming machine into      the desired cross-section. Alternatively, the ornamental member 11 may be      a rod of aluminum or the like, which has been extruded into the desired      cross-section. </PAR><PAR>  The ornamental member 11 is bent outwardly at or near the corner portion 10      away from the above-mentioned reference plane, so that it is in abutment      with the outer surface of the window plate 2 along the upper portion 8,      and spaced from the window plate 2 along the side portions 9 to leave a      clearance 12 therebetween. The ornamental member 11 has an outer surface      with a laminated synthetic resin layer 13 thereon, which is provided with      a lip 14 opposite to the window plate 2. The lip 14 extends along the      upper and corner portions 8, 10 of the molding assembly, while it is not      present along the side portions 9, e.g. by removal of material. The      ornamental member 11 has a substantially C-shaped cross-section to form an      interior space 15 therein, and is provided with retainer edges 16, 17 on      both sides of the cross-section. </PAR><PAR>  The molding assembly 4 further includes a weir member 18 for each side      portion 9, which is composed of a profiled metal member of substantially      L-shaped cross-section. The weir member 18 is provided with retainer      elements 19, 20 which are engageable with the retainer edges 16, 17 of the      ornamental member 11, respectively. The retainer element 19 of the weir      member 18, which is engageable with the edge 16 of the ornamental member      11, may be a lug formed by locally pressing out the metal material of the      weir member 18. On the other hand, the retainer element 20 of the weir      member 18, which is engageable with the edge 17 of the ornamental member      11, may be a bent edge of a flange of the weir member 18. The weir member      18 has an outer surface with a laminated synthetic resin layer 21 thereon,      which is provided with a lip 22 opposite to the window plate 2 to extend      along the side portion 9 of the molding assembly. </PAR><PAR>  When the weir member 18 is secured to the ornamental member 11 by engaging      the retainer elements 19, 20 with the retainer edges 16, 17, respectively,      another flange of the weir member 18 protrudes toward the window plate 2      and forms a desired weir 23 along the side portion 9 of the window molding      assembly 1. Thus, the weir 23 fills the above-mentioned clearance 12      between the ornamental member 11 and the window plate 2. This clearance 12      is also filled by an end piece 24 of an integrally molded synthetic resin,      as shown in FIG. 2, which is provided with a lip 25 and associated with      the weir member 18 in the region between the side and corner portions 9,      10 of the window molding assembly 4. The end piece 24 is secured to the      ornamental member 11 so that its lip 25 is aligned with the lips 14 of the      ornamental member 11 and also with the lip 22 of the weir member 18. These      lips 14, 22, 25 are resiliently brought into abutment with the outer      surface of the window plate 2 when the molding assembly 4 is mounted in      place. </PAR><PAR>  The window molding assembly 4 further includes mounting clips 26 arranged      within cutouts 27 which are formed in the weir members 18. Each clip 26      has a top 28 which is accommodated within the interior space 15 of the      ornamental member 11 in engagement with the retainer edges 16, 17,      projection 29 received in the interior space 30 of the weir member 18 in      engagement therewith, a leg 31 to be engaged with a fastener 32 fixedly      secured, e.g. by means of an adhesive tape 33, to a stepped wall 5b of the      automobile body panel 5 adjacent to the flange portion 5a, and another      projection 34 in the form of extensions from the leg 31 so as to be      engaged with the rear side of the window plate 2. </PAR><PAR>  With the above-mentioned arrangement of the window molding assembly 4, the      weir member 18 is secured to the ornamental member 11 by engaging the      retainer elements 19, 20 with the retainer edges 16, 17, and the      ornamental member 11 is then secured to the automobile body panel 5 by      means of the clips 26 so as to cover a gap between the body panel 5 and      the peripheral edge of the front window plate 2. On this occasion, the leg      31 of the clip 26 is brought into engagement with the fastener 32, with      the head 28 of the clip 26 in engagement with both the ornamental member      11, and with the weir member 18 and the projections 29, 34 in engagement      with the weir member 18 and the window plate 2, respectively. The molding      assembly is thus firmly secured to the body panel 5 by means of the      adhesive material 6. </PAR><PAR>  In the mounted state of the window molding assembly 4, the ornamental      member 11 is in abutment with the outer surface of the window plate 2      along the upper portion 8, and spaced from the window plate 2 along the      side portions 9 so that the weir member 18 is in abutment with the outer      surface of the window plate 2 along the side portion to form a weir 23      between the ornamental member 11 and the window plate 2. The weir 23      serves to guide and collect rain water on the window plate during driving      in rainy conditions, to thereby prevent rain water from flowing across the      side portion of the molding member toward the side window, and preserve      the driver's and/or navigator's sight through the side windows. </PAR><PAR>  Another embodiment of the window molding assembly according to the present      invention is shown in FIGS. 9 to 11. This embodiment features an      arrangement wherein the weir member 18 is formed integrally with the end      piece 24 from a hard synthetic resin and provided with the lip 22 which is      formed of a plasticized synthetic resin. The weir member 18 is secured to      the ornamental member 11 with a cushion element 35 therebetween, which may      be formed of a foamed material or adhesive material. Except for the above      differences, the embodiment shown in FIGS. 9 to 11 is substantially the      same in structure and function as the previous one. </PAR><PAR>  Another embodiment of the window molding assembly according to the present      invention is shown in FIGS. 12 to 15. This embodiment features an      arrangement wherein the weir member 18 is secured to mounting clips 36      which, in turn, are secured to the ornamental member 14. More      particularly, each mounting clip 36 includes a top 37 which is      accommodated within the interior space 15 of the ornamental member 11 in      engagement with the retainer edges 16, 17, a retainer projection 38 to be      engaged with a longitudinally continuous recess 39 in the weir member 18,      and a leg 40 to be engaged with the fastener 32 on the stepped wall 5b of      the automobile body panel 5. There is provided a cushion element 41 to be      opposed to the window plate 2, which is adhered to the lower surface of      the ornamental member 11 along the upper and corner portions 8, 10 of the      window molding assembly 4, and also to the lower end of the weir member 18      along the side portion 9. The cushion element 41 is provided with a lip 42      to be brought into abutment with the outer surface of the window plate 2. </PAR><PAR>  As an alternative, slightly modified arrangement, as shown in FIG. 16, the      weir member 18 may be provided with a plurality of resiliently deformable      lugs 43 each inserted into, and engaged with a corresponding hole 44 in      the retainer projection 38 of the mounting clip 36. </PAR><PAR>  The arrangement of the window molding assembly 4 described with reference      to FIGS. 12 to 16 makes it possible to mount the assembly in a facilitated      manner, and to reduce the number of manufacturing steps of the assembly in      that each mounting clip 36 achieves dual functions of securing the      assembly to the automobile body panel and retaining the weir member in      place. Except for the above differences, the embodiments shown in FIGS. 12      to 15 and FIG. 16 are substantially the same in structure and function as      the previous embodiments. </PAR><PAR>  Still another embodiment of the window molding assembly according to the      invention is shown in FIGS. 17 to 25. This embodiment features an      arrangement wherein the weir member 18 is formed integrally with fastener      means for securing the molding assembly 4 to the automobile body panel 5.      More particularly, as shown in FIGS. 21 and 22, there is provided an      elongate fastener member 43 for each side portion 9 of the window molding      assembly 4, which is composed of an appropriate hard synthetic resin with      a required flexibility and rigidity, and which is integral with the weir      member 18. </PAR><PAR>  The fastener member 43 includes a head 44 of a substantially constant width      W along its entire length, and a plurality of legs 45 of the same height      H.sub.1, which are suspended from the head 44 and spaced from each other      by a predetermined distance in the longitudinal direction of the fastener      member 43. Each leg 45 has a hook-like projection 46 which is to be      engaged with the fastener 32 on the stepped wall 5b of the automobile body      panel 5. As can be seen from FIGS. 18 to 20, the weir member 18 integral      with the fastener member 43 has a height H.sub.2 which gradually decreases      toward its end to be arranged at, or adjacent to the corner portion 10,      corresponding to the clearance 12 between the ornamental member 14 and the      window plate 2. There is provided a cushion element 47 (FIG. 23) to be      opposed to the window plate 2, which is secured to the lower end of the      weir member 18 and provided with a lip to be brought into abutment with      the outer surface of the window plate 2. </PAR><PAR>  The window molding assembly 4 along its upper portion 8 is secured to the      automobile body panel 5 by means of a plurality of mounting clips 48. As      shown in FIGS. 24 and 25, each clip 48 includes a top 49 which is      accommodated within the interior space 15 of the ornamental member 11 in      engagement with the retainer edges 16, 17, and a leg 50 with a retainer      projection 51 to be engaged with the fastener 32 fixedly secured to the      stepped wall 5b of the automobile body panel 5. </PAR><PAR>  In the above-mentioned embodiment of FIGS. 17 to 25, the clearance 12      between the ornamental member 11 and the window plate 2 along the side      portion 9 is made to slightly decrease toward the corner portion 10,      though this is not a prerequisite condition. Thus, as shown in FIG. 26,      the ornamental member 11 may be subjected to such bending that the      clearance 12 changes abruptly near the corner portion 10. </PAR><PAR>  The arrangement of the window molding assembly 4 described with reference      to FIGS. 17 to 26 makes it possible to mount the assembly in a further      facilitated manner, and to reduce the number of components and      manufacturing steps in that the fastener member 43 for securing the window      molding assembly 4 to the automobile body panel 5 is integral with the      weir member 18. Except for the above differences, the embodiments shown in      FIGS. 17 to 25 and FIG. 26 are substantially same in structure and      function as the previous embodiments. </PAR><PAR>  It will be readily appreciated from the foregoing description that the      present invention provides an improved automobile window molding assembly,      which includes an elongate ornamental member composed of a profiled metal      member with a refined appearance in smoothness and continuity at the      corner portion despite difference in height of the automobile body panel      at the upper and side portions. </PAR><PAR>  While the present invention has been explained with reference to certain      specific embodiments, which were given by way of examples only, various      modifications are possible without departing from the scope of the      invention. For example, the ornamental member may have an imaginary      reference plane P which corresponds to the outer surface of the window      plate, and which is inclined by a predetermined angle relative to the      outer surface of the automobile body panel along the side portion when the      assembly is mounted in place, to make it readily possible to form the      desired weir between the ornamental member and the window plate without      requiring bending of the ornamental member so that it is spaced away from      the window plate. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
