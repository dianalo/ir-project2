The big aluminum company announced last month that it planned to build a facility to produce commercial quantities of the new material but didn't select a site. Jonquiere is in the Saguenay region, north of Quebec City.    The plant will cost an estimated 30 million Canadian dollars ($24.3 million) and will have an annual capacity of 25 million pounds of the material, which has applications in the automotive, aerospace and defense industries as well as in sporting equipment. Alcan currently produces limited quantities of the material.    Construction is expected to begin soon for completion in mid-1989. The plant will employ about 30 people.    Alcan said the site was selected because it is adjacent to an existing smelter, which will provide molten metal, and near a company research and development center. </TEXT></DOC>
