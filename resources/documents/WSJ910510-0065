Designed to handle the large, detailed drawings made byengineers, the machines include a facsimile machine, a copierand several types of plotters. Xerox also announced softwarethat allows engineers to print on their plotterscomputer-generated documents that adhere to a standard knownas PostScript. That task had previously required an extramachine to translate computer files.</LP><TEXT>   Industry consultants said they were impressed by some ofthe equipment, especially the Xerox 7124 fax machine, whichcan handle documents as much as 24 inches wide. Manyengineers are stymied by narrow fax machines and must sendlarge, urgent drawings via overnight mail.   Even if connected to a regular office fax, the new devicewill transmit wide documents in three strips, marking withdots the way the pieces should be reassembled. The 7124,which also acts as a copier, will be available in August for$14,995, Xerox said.   The consultants added, however, that they weredisappointed that Xerox's new offerings weren't tightlyintegrated into an engineering system that included computersand software.</TEXT></DOC>
