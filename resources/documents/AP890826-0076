The conclusion of the strike at one minute after midnight Fridayfollowed Walesa's appeal that the new prime minister be allowed tostart work with the support of all Poles. The independent tradeunion leader said Mazowiecki's election was a ``breakthrough'' notto be wasted.   Walesa also suggested Friday that the strike by the railwayworkers in Lodz, the country's second-largest city located incentral Poland, could be a ``provocation'' against Mazowiecki, whothis week took office as head of the first non-communist governmentin the East bloc.   ``We trust that as premier you represent the interests of theworking people and you will take immediately decisions satisfyingour demands,'' the workers said in announcing the end of the strike.The statement was carried on PAP, the state news agency.   Abandoning the strike, they said, was ``proof of our support andtrust'' for Mazowiecki.   The prime minister, who assumed office Thursday in a historictransfer of power from the Communist Party to a Solidarity-ledcoalition, traveled to the southern shrine city of Czestochowa todayto take part in annual ceremonies honoring the Black Madonna,Poland's most revered icon.   He planned meetings with various political leaders as he beganthe task of assembling his Cabinet.   In his first meeting with a top Soviet official, the primeminister met in Warsaw with Vladimir Kryuchkov, the chief of theSoviet KGB who is on a working visit to Poland, said RyszardWojtkowski, acting as Mazowiecki's spokesman.   The meeting was private and its agenda was not known. Beforehand,Kryuchkov spoke with several of Poland's top Communist officials.   The Soviet Union has generally approved the dramatic politicalchanges in Poland. However, the Soviet Communist Party daily Pravdatoday said that while Polish Communists may have suffered a defeat,nobody should write their political obituary. The article appearedto be a warning to Polish radicals.   With the Mazowiecki's election, Pravda said, ``Extremist-mindedpeople are hurrying to write off the Polish United Workers Partybecause, they argue, it has finally found itself in isolation,abandoned by its associates.''   That would be premature, Pravda cautioned. In fact, it said, theCommunists by right are the most important group in Polish politics.   Mazowiecki met Friday with emissaries from the superpowers,including U.S. Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole and Soviet AmbassadorVladimir Brovikov.   After the meeting, Mrs. Dole said Washington will consider newways to help Poland, but she did not mention financial aid beyondthe $119 million President Bush offered during a July visit.   Solidarity leaders have been hoping for a $10 billion from theWest, and Walesa said the West would be to blame if Poland's newgovernment failed for lack of financial aid.   ``Obviously, we do have a budget deficit at home,'' Mrs. Dolesaid. ``We will provide aid as we can, when we can, but there isalready a very significant program under way.''   She said Bush soon will send U.S. experts to Poland to study howthey can help.   Her husband, Senate Minority leader Robert Dole, R-Kan., andthree Democrats, Sen. Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, Rep. Jim Moodyof Wisconsin and Sen. Dennis DeConcini, also attended the meeting.   Dole said Mazowiecki told him: ```He who helps early, helpstwice.' In other words, this is very important now to keep up themomentum and let the Polish people see some change.''   Walesa, who convinced Communist President Wojciech Jaruzelski tosupport the Solidarity-led government, said Friday that Mazowiecki'sselection was the ``breakthrough'' needed to stop Poland's economicdecline.   But to succeed, Poland needs financial help _ and much more thanthe West has offered so far, Walesa said Friday on ABC's ``20-20.''   ``I will say that if we fail, we can blame the world, even theUnited States, that you haven't contributed with cooperation inthese conditions of civilization development; you will be to blamefor Polish failure,'' he said.   In a show of support unthinkable just a few months ago, CommunistParty chief Miezcyslaw F. Rakowski interrupted an official visit toBulgaria to send Mazowiecki a telegram Friday promising the party'ssupport ``in everything aiming at leading the country out of thecrisis.''   Soviet Ambassador Vladimir Brovikov met with Mazoiecki andcongratulated him on his election by the Sejm, the lower house ofthe National Assembly. Mazowiecki sent greetings to the Sovietpeople, a government spokesman said.</TEXT></DOC>
