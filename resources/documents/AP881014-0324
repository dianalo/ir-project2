Sunday's meeting here of the Gulf Cooperation Council, whichincludes ministers from six Persian Gulf nations, comes amid abackdrop of price-war threats and rollercoaster prices thatsometimes have dropped as much as $8 below the $18-a-barrelbenchmark for crude.   In New York, speculation that OPEC members would agree onproduction cuts sent prices soaring Friday in the oil futuresmarket.   The November contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmarkgrade of U.S. crude oil, shot up 71 cents a barrel to settle at$14.92 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract hadbriefly traded below $12.30 a barrel as recently as last week.   ``Within the GCC, we must have one strategy, one oil policy,''said GCC Secretary-General Abdullah Bishara of Kuwait.   GCC members include Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, the United ArabEmirates, Bahrain and Oman. With the exception of Bahrain and Oman,each nation is a member of the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries.   OPEC has been trying to reign in production by its 13 memberstates in an effort to boost oil prices.   Oil industry executives estimate that during August, GCC nationsalong with Iran and Iraq accounted for 13 million barrels a day ofOPEC's 20-million-barrel daily output. Had the nations adhered totheir designated OPEC production quotas, the outflow would havebeen 10.5 million barrels a day.   Iraq and Iran ignored their OPEC quotas to finance their8-year-old war. Although a cease-fire went into effect Aug. 20,both sides have insisted they be allowed to produce as much asneeded to finance reconstruction.   A Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said theGulf states ``will have to find some way of helping Iran and Iraq,otherwise they will just keep producing.''   Iraq has hinted it will accept an OPEC production ceiling tobolster prices. It is producing about 2.7 million barrels a dayagainst a quota of 1.5 million barrels a day. Iran's output ispegged at about 2.5 million barrels a day, slightly above its2.36-million-barrel quota. Damage to its facilities prevents higheroutput.   Within the the GCC, the Emirates has publicly set its ceiling at1.5 million barrels daily, compared to its 948,000-barrel quota.Oil industry analysts have said Kuwait is also above its OPEC mark.And Saudi Arabia, the world's largest exporter and OPEC's mostinfluential member, has served notice that it will no longer play``swing producer'' by decreasing its own output to balanceoverproduction of others.   The kingdom said this month it had lost $109 billion over theyears in attempting to shore up prices.   Saudi sources who spoke on condition of anonymity, said thatSaudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazer will submit a plan to restore``balance and stability to the oil market.''   The kingdom has stressed it backs OPEC and is ready to abide byquotas if other members do, but observers say its threats toincrease production is a pressure tactic to get others in line.   A Western diplomat noted that ``as long as others are cheatingon their quotas, Saudi Arabia will too. ...They're not looking tostart a price war, but they are looking to defend their marketshare.''   The day after the Saudis' Oct. 3 announcement, crude pricesdropped to a 26-month low. ``It takes what the Saudis have done toget everybody back in line,'' said an industry source here.   In 1983, the Saudis cut back their oil production to helpstabilize prices but lost so much market share that two yearslater, they resorted to net-back pricing _ pegging crude prices tothe value of refined products. Other producers followed suit andoil prices collapsed. In early 1987, OPEC countries halted net-backpricing and briefly drove up prices.   The pro-government media has been lashing out at OPEC. TheEnglish-language Riyadh Daily referred to the cartel as ``anothermotley organization whose members are perenially atcross-purposes.''   Prices have edged back up since the Saudi announcement, andanalysts have said a cold winter might also help raise prices ifthe demand for heating oil increases.   Some sources say quotas may be increased to bring the currentceiling of 15.06 million barrels daily more closely in line withactual production of about 20 million barrels daily. A full OPECmeeting has been scheduled for Nov. 21 in Vienna.</TEXT></DOC>
