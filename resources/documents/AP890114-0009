The 19 percent increase in deaths occurred over a period thatvaried for each state, depending on when drivers were allowed to gofaster, said the report Friday by the National Highway TrafficSafety Administration. Congress authorized the increased limitbeginning April 2, 1987, and 38 states have adopted it for theirrural interstates.   Highway deaths in those states on urban interstates and otherroads where the 55 mph limit remained totaled 21,366 for the sameperiod in 1986 and 21,231 in 1987, the report said.   Fatalities in states that raised the speed limit increased by anaverage nearly three times as high as in 10 states that kept thelimit at 55 on all roads, the report showed.   But the safety administration, in releasing the first of threeplanned annual reports, said there were ``substantial variations''among the states and some such as California actually showed fewerdeaths on rural interstates after new speeds were posted.   The report also said there was not enough evidence to determinethe speed limit's long-term impact on highway safety.   Critics of the higher speed limit said the increased death tollwas enough reason to return to the 55 mph limit nationwide.   ``This report can be summed up in two words: speed kills,'' saidSen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., chairman of the Senate Appropriationstransportation subcommittee, who has opposed the increase.   Overall, 373 more people died on rural interstates in 1987 thanin 1986, the report said. Of those, 352 were in states that raisethe speed limit and 21 in states that did not.   The highway safety agency, in its 67-page report, said ruralinterstate fatalities account for only 5 percent of Americans killedin road accidents, and the increase had only a small impact onoverall traffic fatalities which total about 46,000 a year.   The report noted that 24,000 people are killed each year incrashes where alcohol is involved and 8,000 are pedestrians hit byvehicles.   ``NHTSA continues to believe that setting speed limits is amatter for state legislatures to decide based on their review ofavailable fatality and injury data, actual experience and localconditions,'' the report said.   It noted that Arizona and New Mexico experienced large increasesin fatalities after raising the limit to 65 but states that did notalso had significant increases. They include Connecticut, Georgia,Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania,Rhode Island and Virginia.   States that increased the speed limit to 65 and had overalldecreases in traffic fatalities included Colorado, Florida, Indiana,Maine, New Hampshire, Montana, Oklahoma and Oregon.</TEXT></DOC>
