WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   Democrats Albert Gore Jr. and Richard Gephardt campaigned in theglow of popular non-candidates Monday _ Gore with Mario Cuomo andGephardt with Lee Iacocca _ but came away without endorsements.Republican George Bush touted his endorsement by New Jersey Gov.Thomas H. Kean.   Bush, meanwhile, gave out another kind of endorsement _ lendinghis support to President Reagan's veto of a major civil rightsbill. Congress was poised to override the veto on Tuesday.   ``The legislation ... is imperfect and the imperfections shouldbe corrected,'' he told a group of black supporters in Washington.``I'm not going to start doing now what I haven't been doing forseven years, finding differences with the president, for whom Ihave great respect.''   Bush said, however, that he supported the idea that the federalgovernment should require that organizations that get tax dollarscomply with civil rights laws.   Officials in Puerto Rico, meanwhile, continued to tally theresults of Sunday's primaries, in which Bush rolled up anothervictory over Bob Dole and Jesse Jackson and Michael Dukakis addedto their Democratic totals.   While Bush attended a New Jersey rally with Kean, Republicanrival Dole said in Wisconsin that that was the state where he wastrying to ``get back in the race.''   Democratic candidates were focusing on Michigan, whereSaturday's caucuses are the next big event after weekend contestsin Kansas, Texas and Puerto Rico that helped Dukakis and Jackson.   Gephardt and Gore won kind words but no endorsement in meetingswith Chrysler Corp. chairman Iacocca and New York Gov. Cuomo.   Cuomo, the most prominent Democratic non-candidate, describedhis meeting with Gore as ``excellent'' and ``interesting'' _ butthen said: ``Senator Gore said nothing that I haven't heard him saybefore.''   ``The endorsements don't mean a great deal. The truth is, Ididn't even need to see Al Gore,'' said Cuomo. ``It's nice of himto come by.''   Cuomo called the Democratic field a ``confused picture'' andsaid he was ``now accelerating the process of trying to determinehow best to be useful to the Democratic Party.''   Gephardt appeared with Iacocca, who also has been mentioned attimes as a possible presidential candidate, outside the ChryslerCorp. headquarters in Highland Park, Mich., as Gephardt tried torevive his flagging candidacy by stressing his tough trade policiesin the auto-producing state.   Iacocca said, ``Dick Gephardt's a good friend of mine and heknows what he's talking about on trade.'' But he made noendorsement and said he also was looking forward to meeting withother presidential candidates.   Beyond Michigan, Wisconsin's primary 10 days later was shapingup as a further Democratic battleground, two weeks before the bigNew York primary April 19.   Gore began running television ads in Wisconsin in hopes ofmaking it the state where he demonstrates appeal outside the South.Sen. Paul Simon, who won in his home state last week, was making aminimal effort in Michigan but intended to run ads in Wisconsin.   Connecticut holds its primary one week earlier, March 29, andDukakis was considered the leader, although Gore would like todemonstrate some strength in the Massachusetts governor's backyard.   Jackson campaigned in Colorado, where caucuses are April 4, andin Michigan on Monday.   Republican Dole, also looking to Wisconsin, talked with farmersin the northwest part of the state and renewed his call for Bush todebate him.   Earlier, in Green Bay, Dole accused the Reagan administration ofnot doing a good job of making its case for aid to the Contras, whoare battling Nicaragua's Sandinista regime.   ``If you took a poll in Wisconsin, I think a majority would beopposed to Contra aid,'' he said. ``But if you asked the samepeople if they think the Soviets should have a base in thishemisphere, they would say `no' by a wide margin.''   Kean's endorsement came as Bush added to a seeminglyinsurmountable lead in delegates.   Bush picked up the 14 delegates at stake in Puerto Rico'sprimary Sunday, boosting his total to 788. That's nearly 70 percentof the 1,139 he needs to win at the national convention in NewOrleans this summer. Dole had 178. Former television evangelist PatRobertson had 17.   Bush won in Puerto Rico with an overwhelming 98 percent of thevote in a primary system that in both parties was caught up inlocal disputes and issues such as the divisive question ofstatehood for the U.S. territory.   The 51 Democratic delegates from Puerto Rico all ran asuncommitted, and the candidates promised major efforts to woo themin coming weeks.   Jackson won the non-binding preference poll among Puerto RicoDemocrats. Dukakis ran second and Simon third.   Dukakis won the Kansas caucuses on Saturday, picking up 16delegates. But Jackson ran a strong second and won 14 delegates.   In Texas, Jackson appeared to do better, splitting the delegatesthere in county conventions that were the next step in allocatingat-large delegates for the state. That gave Jackson a one-delegateedge over Dukakis in the Texas national delegate count _ includingboth the primary and caucus results _ but more complete returnscould change that.   In total delegates, Dukakis clung to a small lead over Jackson.The figures were: Dukakis 526.5, Jackson 508.55, Gore 362.8, Simon171.5 and Gephardt 154. To nominate, 2,082 delegates are needed.   There are 138 delegates to be decided in Michigan's caucuses. Aweekend poll by the Detroit News had Dukakis with 33 percent andJackson 30 percent _ a virtual tie. Gephardt was far behind inthird place.</TEXT></DOC>
