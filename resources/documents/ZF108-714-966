 business.andM;Many corporations are choosing once-taboo alternatives such as theconsolidation of data centers or the outsourcing of nonstrategic functions.andM;Data center operations typically represent better than half of a dataprocessing budget, which in turn is typically the largest back officeexpense.andP;  Those numbers provide a large target for budget slashing.andM;&quot;In today's business environment, all of a company's operational functionsare being evaluated,&quot; said Michael Connolly, senior manager at Nolan, Nortonandamp; Co., a Lexington, Mass., consultant who has reviewed data center operationsfor a number of clients.andP;  &quot;Data center operations represent 50% to 70% of theinformation systems budget and are growing,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;The people at the topof corporations start to consider what they're getting for this expense.andP;  Thecost pressures are extreme.&quot;andM;However, warned George Hathaway, a principal of The Index Group, a Cambridge,Mass.-based information systems consulting firm, a more streamlined dataprocessing organization can also make the company more attractive toacquisition.andM;Some choices for cost-cutting, according to Connolly, include: making datacenters more efficient; consolidating data centers, producing economies ofscale; and outsourcing selected functions to concentrate internal resourceson strategic initiatives.andP;  A company may choose to use one or any combinationof those choices as a cost-cutting strategy.andM;Among the more publicized cost-cutting efforts was the disclosure in Januarythat ATandamp;T, Morristown, N.J., was moving to consolidate its data centeroperations from 12 sites into five, and the 1989 decision by Eastman KodakCo., Rochester, N.Y., to outsource three major components of its informationprocessing operation.andM;BELT-TIGHTENING AT ATandamp;TandM;Bernie McElroy, project director for the data processing consolidation effortat ATandamp;T, said that a review of operations conducted last summer determinedthat the company's data center operations required some &quot;radical&quot; changes.andM;That evaluation had been spurred by a management demand for cost reduction,faster delivery of new services to internal customers and greater emphasis onquality of service, McElroy said.andM;&quot;We also took a look at what was happening with the technology and theability to get higher performance ratios,&quot; McElroy said.andP;  &quot;The footprint sizeof machines was shrinking dramatically, and we didn't see that trendstopping.andM;&quot;Our floorspace projections showed we had too much space out there,&quot; hecontinued.andP;  &quot;Among the other things we considered were automated operations,remote operations and the capacity to mechanize many functions.&quot;andM;ATandamp;T estimates that cutting back from 12 to five data centers by the end of1991 will save $70 million a year.andM;McElroy said the savings will result from a combination of reduced hardware,floorspace and staffing.andM;Approximately 1,000 workers in the sites targeted for closing, including datacenters in Cincinnati, Hamilton Township, N.J., Greensboro, N.C., Oakton,Va., and Fairhaven, Mass., will be relocated, retrained or retired.andP;  Thecompany says it has not yet determined whether it will be forced to fire anyof the data center workers whose jobs will be eliminated.andP;  The ATandamp;Tinformation systems workforce now totals about 7,400.andM;Currently, the combined ATandamp;T data centers have computer systems generatingabout 3,800 Mips (millions of instructions per second), with a mix of themainframe VM, MVS and UTS operating systems in each center.andM;Once the consolidation is completed and all the machines relocated, ATandamp;T willreview its capacity plan in an effort to cut its hardware requirements.andP;  Theplan calls for accounting, marketing and engineering applications to beconsolidated into the five sites.andM;The ATandamp;T consolidation effort is managed at each site by teams of 10representatives from several fields, including data processing, networkmanagement, product engineering, support groups and customers.andP;  Subteams havebeen assigned to specific areas, such as a capacity plan at the receivingsite.andM;OUTSOURCING, &quot;A RADICAL MOVE&quot;andM;Kodak last year began implementing a number of moves to increase informationprocessing efficiency and cut data center operations costs an estimated 40%to 50%.andM;First, the company signed a contract calling for IBM personnel to manage datacenter operations, which were to be consolidated from four sites into one.andO;Later, Kodak signed a contract to outsource data center telecommunicationsoperations to Digital Equipment Corp., Maynard, Mass.andP;  Finally, BusinessLandwas contracted for PC procurement and maintenance.andM;Kathleen Hudson, Kodak vice president and director of corporate informationsystems (IS), contended that savings generated from consolidating andoutsourcing can occur twice as fast as in a cost-cutting program using onlyinternal personnel.andP;  Hudson acknowledged that the degree of outsourcingcontracted for the Kodak IS operation is a radical move for a $17 billioncorporation.andM;IS executives and consultants say that consolidation and outsourcing canaccomplish far more than just reducing costs.andM;Both strategies are as much techniques for improving the quality ofinformation services and instituting greater management control as they arefor reducing expenses, said Hathaway, of the Index Group.andM;&quot;Certainly the cost savings are tremendous--a consolidation can save 25% to30% of operational costs--but the gain also comes in terms of quality,&quot;Hathaway said.andP;  &quot;We find that consolidated operations have consolidated theirtalent.andP;  It is a matter of economy of scale.&quot;andM;Hathaway noted that pooled talent can provide improved technical support.andP;  Inaddition, a client determined during a consolidation of four data centersinto one that his firm had a previously unnoticed lack of security.andM;While cost pressures and technological changes have led to a reevaluation ofdata center operations at several firms, mergers and acquisitions have alsocontributed to a duplication of effort in some IS organizations.andP;  Forexample, many firms acquire new units with their own data centers.andM;Connolly, of Nolan, Norton andamp; Co., has found that many firms still resistdramatic data center changes due to an inability to change a strong corporateculture.andP;  &quot;It's also a cultural problem,&quot; he said.andM;The first step to solving such a problem requires a strategic review of adata center operation, according to Connolly.andP;  The examination should includethe state of the industry and competition, the critical nature of informationprocessing in that industry and the effectiveness of the company's dataprocessing organization.andM;A DP executive at a large midwestern auto parts manufacturer, who asked notto be identified, said his corporate managers expected such a review to provethat the IS organization was operating inefficiently.andP;  But a consultant studyinstead showed that resources were being used effectively, and recommendedthat the company hire more staff and add processors.andM;&quot;A lot of what the consultants recommended was already in the pipeline buthad to be developed faster,&quot; said the executive.andP;  &quot;They said we were doing agood job with what was available to us, but our users needed more.andP;  We'reactually adding heads and bringing some more resources online.&quot;andM;However, information systems executives and industry executives generallyagree that most large data centers could benefit from some belt tightening.andM;&quot;What we're going through right now at ATandamp;T is something the whole industryfaces, whether they realize it or not,&quot; said McElroy.andP;  &quot;We've contacted otherlarge data processing shops to compare notes and they are experiencing asimilar process.andP;  In some cases they're ahead of the curve and in other caseswe're further along.andP;  All companies are facing these pressures and theopportunities available because of them.&quot;andM;In some cases, companies can gain greater control of an operation by shiftingsome work to another company.andP;  A contractor has more incentive to performthan an employee, some observers say.andP;  When a contractor fails to meetspecified levels the relationship ends.andP;  In an in-house effort the situationis not so clear-cut.andM;But the outsourcing option also requires caution, warn those familiar withsuch relationships.andM;Outsourcing carries the least risk and the most benefit when the function isroutine, easily offloaded and not strategic to the corporate mission,according to consultants.andM;Said Hathaway of The Index Group: &quot;Everyone 'outsources' their electricalneeds and many outsource their payroll processing to someone like ADP[Automatic Data Processing, Roseland, N.J.], so why not other genericfunctions?andP;  The question you have to ask is, 'What is proprietary and mustremain in the hands of the company?'andP;  It's not necessary to do it all.&quot;andM;The belief that internal staff does not have to do all the work was the keyto the Kodak decision to outsource much of its data processing.andM;The outsourcing decision grew from management's desire to focus more on itscore business and less on routine data processing functions.andP;  &quot;Our people nowhave the time [to] devote to meeting our strategic needs,&quot; a spokesman said.andM;The good news appears to be for reliable and culturally suitable contractproviders of information services, such as IBM, the Electronic Data Systemsunit of General Motors Co. and the Computer Task Group.andP;  &quot;It's not yourtypical vendor contract--it's truly a partnership,&quot; said Connolly.andP;  &quot;You haveto be sure there's a cultural match.&quot;andM;Up for GrabsandM;In the various scenarios for outsourcing software development, cost controlremains a top motivation at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.; dealing with a worseningpersonnel shortage is a close second.andM;&quot;We all are under cost pressure,&quot; said DuWayne Peterson, executive vicepresident of operations, systems and telecommunications of the New York-basedbrokerage firm.andM;Privacy, security and strategic considerations are the most significantdeterrents to outsourcing, Peterson said at the recent Adapso SpringManagement Conference in Washington.andM;Although theoretically &quot;everything is up for grabs&quot; for outside development,competitive considerations such as the value of certain databases might arguefor doing the job in-house.andM;Peterson had served as top IS executive at the Security Pacific bank and FordMotor Co., before reportedly becoming the nation's highest-paid chiefinformation officer at Merrill Lynch.andM;He terms systems integration an off-shoot of outsourcing, and is wary aboutpartnering with product vendors.andM;&quot;As a customer, I am very concerned&quot; about having product vendors serve incritical roles like systems integration.andM;&quot;And the systems integrator will be competing for personnel,&quot; he added.andO;End-user computing may help address the shortage of software engineers, butPeterson does not want to compete for people with outside suppliers.andM;At the conference, he called on his audience to work more closely witheducational institutions to reverse the decline in computer-science majors.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
