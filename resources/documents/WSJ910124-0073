Honda Motor Co., Nissan Motor Corp., and Toyota MotorCorp. say they plan to make up any differences between anemployee's military and civilian pay for as long as thePersian Gulf conflict keeps the worker away from the job.</LP><TEXT>   The Big Three U.S. auto makers are bridging the pay gapsfor only one month.   Some Big Three spokesmen suggested yesterday that theJapanese companies are offering more generous benefits as aresponse to criticism of the Japanese government. Severalprominent members of Congress, Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee A.Iacocca and the United Auto Workers union earlier this monthcalled for tighter limits on imports of Japanese cars andcited Japan's failure to contribute more heavily to the wareffort. But spokesmen for the Japanese auto makers are quickto deny any connection.   &quot;That seems to be a matter between the Japanese governmentand the U.S. government. It's not a matter that involves theToyota Motor Corp.,&quot; said Toyota spokesman James Wiseman.   U.S. auto makers said it's easier for the Japanese automakers to make up lost pay for reservists because they havefewer employees affected.   General Motors Corp. yesterday said its policy is nowunder review.</TEXT></DOC>
