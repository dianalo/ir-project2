Banking, insurance, real estate and other interests gavepanel members $3,254,040 in political-action committeecontributions in the 1989-90 election cycle, according to ananalysis by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisanresearch group. In fact, the group says, five of the 10 toprecipients of political-action committee funds in the Houseserve on the banking committee.</LP><TEXT>   Overall, the group says, financial and real estate groupscontributed $25 million to members of Congress, more than anyother interest group except labor.   Those contributions loom especially large now, given theBush administration's proposal to revamp banking laws,including allowing banks to branch nationwide and offer awider range of financial services. The proposal has triggereda spirited political battle. Interest groups are strugglingto protect their competitive positions. Small banks arefighting big banks; securities, insurance, real estate andmutual fund interests all want to protect their franchisesfrom banks.   &quot;One of the reasons it has been so hard to enactcomprehensive banking legislation is that you have such huge,influential lobbies all fighting each other,&quot; says EdwardYingling, chief lobbyist for the American BankersAssociation.   The ABA's PAC contributed $261,709 to panel members forthe 1990 elections; overall, according to the researchgroup's tabulation, banking interests were the most prolificgivers, contributing $1,305,597. The insurance industrycontributed $702,897; real estate interests contributed$466,540.   Securities-industry PACs gave $185,300, but individualcontributions from the industry, which are difficult totrack, could be much more than that, estimates LarryMakinson, the center's research director. Despite thescandals surrounding the collapse of the savings-and-loanindustry, 39 panel members still accepted thrift PAC money --though the industry's financial problems and the politicaltaint of such contributions held its giving to panel membersto $173,331, much less than in the previous cycle.   All told, the top recipient on the committee wasDemocratic Rep. Doug Barnard of Georgia, a former banker andlong a supporter of measures to make banks more profitable.He received a total of $179,512, including $94,800 fromcommercial banks, $25,500 from real estate interests, $12,000from accountants and $9,000 from insurers.   Illinois Democrat Frank Annunzio, who chairs the FinancialInstitutions subcommittee that just approved most of theadministration's proposal, was second with $171,574. But Mr.Annunzio, no particular friend of banks, got $55,274 from theinsurance industry, $29,050 from financial companies and only$26,750 from banking interests.   &quot;Frank Annunzio is a Chicago populist,&quot; says Paul Equale,senior vice president, government affairs, of the IndependentInsurance Agents of America. &quot;He remembers from the GreatDepression the problems of credit concentration, and hebelieves in his gut that banks shouldn't be involved in theinsurance business.&quot;   Mr. Equale doesn't believe the interests with stakes inthe banking bill will unduly affect the outcome of Congress'sdeliberations; with so many groups giving so much money, hecontends, &quot;we have a tendency to cancel each other out.&quot; Thelawmakers themselves insist that receiving PAC money doesn'taffect their voting.   But others don't see it that way. The money flow to theHouse Banking Committee &quot;really fuels the worst expectationsthe American people have about who owns their legislators,&quot;says Ellen Miller, executive director of the Center forResponsive Politics. &quot;How can the members be expected to makeindependent judgments about bank policy when you see the kindof money they get?&quot;   In fact, PACs and the aggressive lobbying of the groupsbehind them emerged as an awkward issue for some membersduring the Financial Institutions subcommittee's work on theadministration's bill. In particular, heavy-handedreal-estate lobbying proved an embarrassing failure on aprotective amendment that would have rolled back a lawallowing banks in 30 states to compete with real-estateagents.   When at one point Rep. William Orton, the amendment'ssponsor, insisted that his proposal had &quot;nothing to do withthe real estate lobby,&quot; members of the panel responded withloud guffaws. Mr. Orton, a freshman Democrat from Utah,withdrew the amendment in the face of sure defeat.   Mr. Orton says his amendment reflected his concern thatallowing banks into the real estate business could lead tothe types of difficulties that have hurt manysavings-and-loan associations. He insists his efforts hadnothing to do with the $5,000 that the National Associationof Realtors PAC contributed to his first campaign forCongress last year. Committee members didn't understand hisamendment, and &quot;the easy way to attack it was to call it thewater-bucket of special interests,&quot; he says.   An amendment on behalf of another special interest, thecredit-union industry, passed despite a strong attack byDemocratic Rep. Gerald Kleczka of Wisconsin. The amendmentwas sponsored by Rep. Annunzio, who received $13,750 increditunion contributions, the most on the committee. Rep.Kleczka accused the committee of easing treatment of creditunions &quot;because they are friendly to members of Congress atthe right time of the year.&quot; Mr. Annunzio says he has longsupported credit unions because &quot;they're good for thepeople.&quot;   Industry officials say the impact of PAC contributions isoverstated. &quot;There's no way you can buy somebody's vote forten thousand bucks,&quot; the maximum one PAC can give a candidatein an election cycle, says Andrew Shepard, chairman ofExchange Bank in Santa Rosa, Calif., and head of the ABAcommittee that allocated its PAC funds last year.   At most, he says, contributions just provide access tolawmakers, so that the givers can at least be heard. &quot;What wetry to do,&quot; he says, &quot;is get our foot in the door.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
