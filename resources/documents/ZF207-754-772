(products).andO;Product:   Open Desktop (Operating system).andO;Topic:     Operating SystemsEvaluation.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Opening the futureandM;There's nothing basically wrong with OS/2.andP;  One over the initial shock, thehardware requirements aren't really out of line with an average 1990's poweruser's box of tricks.andP;  Memory market madness made a lot of people pausebefore reaching for their wallet.andM;The real shortcoming for OS/2 is that it's not all there yet.andP;  Microsoft andIBM have fulfilled delivery date promises for the initial dose andPresentation Manager which deserves a genuine pat on the back in a world ofrubber shipping calendars.andM;3COM delivered 3+OPEN on time but no one wants the stripped down versioncurrently available with little of the promised inter-connectivity.andP;  So far,the flood of applications needed to get OS/2 off the ground is barely atrickle.andP;  What applications there are, are mere ports of plain vanilla DOSsoftware that can run in protected mode.andP;  Let's face it, the OS/2 world isn'tmuch more interesting than a [C:\] right now.andP;  What's an impatient power usert do?andM;The perennial next great thing, Unix, has always had a lot going for it but,as a multi-user operating system packages 'by techies, for techies', it neverentered the desktop operating system equation - until now.andM;ODT is OS/2 Extended Edition with applications and connectivity already ontap.andP;  It's single-user Unix.andP;  It's shrink-wrapped Unix.andP;  It will be a lot ofthings that Unix has never been before - including friendly.andM;In our exclusive preview article (PC User issue 103), we set out the ODTbasics.andP;  Under a graphics/windowing interface provided by OSF/Motif,multi-tasking DOS and Unix System V Release 3.2 use all the power whichcurrent 386 (and soon 486) boxes can deliver.andP;  The bundle also includes RTI'sIngres/386, an SQL relational database management system.andM;Although there's strong deskop component in ODT, it doesn't stop there.andO;Connectivity via Sun's Network File System, TGP/IP snf LAN Manager are allincluded.andP;  As Kurt Vonnegut said in Slapstick, 'Lonesome no more.'andM;All of the packages included are standards or thereabouts and this is wherethe Open in Open Desktop originates.andM;HOwever, as I write, September is upon us and ODT still isn't finished.andO;Three big chucks aremissing from my next-to-last developer's kit: LAN Managerconnectivity, the Ingres database and most of DOS Merge.andP;  SCO will reallyhave to hustle to get all the ingredients stirred in before the plannedlaunch date in late OCtober.andP;  They've got plenty of help.andM;Reviewing beta software is a trial for the reviewer as well as the software.andO;Expectations and the delivered product are often in conflict.andP;  Given thehassle that the 386 community has received at the hands of the OS/2providers, there could be trouble if ODT isn't delivered close to the targetdate.andM;But there's enough here to know the shape of things that will appear thisautumn.andP;  On with the show!andM;A box of tricksandM;SCO hasn't been lumbered with the IBM/Microsoft marketing philosophy whichdictated that OS/2 be aimed initially at 286 boxes.andP;  A 386 is required forODT.andP;  Like any other power package, ODT looks better the faster it is.andP;  A 486box would run ODT a treat.andM;Memory requirements are a little trickly to specify now.andP;  You're looking forat least 4Mb, if not more.andP;  How much more depends on the degree ofoptimization which can be achieved before the public availability date thisautumn.andP;  It also depends on a lot of operational factors, too, like thenumber of Dos emulation sessions and Unix processes you want dancing on your386 at one time.andP;  ODT supports virtual memory, so your tolerance of memory todisk swapping also determines your RAM budget.andP;  Read the next paragraphcarefully.andM;You'll need a good size (100Mb) hard disk in the box with your 386.andP;  OpenDeskTop, in its pre-release developer's version, was a good fit in a 70Mbpartition on a 120Mb Micropolis drive.andP;  You also want a fast, dependable harddrive too.andP;  Unix is quite rigorous with its drive usage so make sure yourWinchester has the right stuff.andP;  SCSI is the recommended interface forexpandability.andM;There was about 20Mb of free space left for applications and data once themajority of the developer's kit was installed.andP;  Obviously, a desktop userwon't require the whole developer's ball of wax, nor would it be likely tofind a user with all of the connectivity options installed, either.andM;There ought to be a law that every hard disk over 40Mb should be suppliedwith a tape backup unit.andP;  Nobody backs up a 120Mb disk onto floppy disk, eventhe 1.44Mb kind.andP;  That can lead to problems.andP;  When you install and configureODT, or any other complex package for that matter, you're talking about a dayputting it back together, irrespective of the data lost, if smoke comesrolling out of the back of your PC.andM;VGA is required for the graphical user interface.andP;  It's a shame that 800x600Super VGA isn't supported.andP;  The high-end capabilities of my Hitachi Multiwent unused.andP;  The extra resolution would make for a more attractive, easierto use product.andM;If you're in love with a two-button mouse you'd better get ready for atransition.andP;  A three-button rodent is required to get the most from theXhibit front-end.andP;  I rummaged around until I found a Logitech mouse in myback room.andP;  It's inferior to the mass/acceleration/form of the Microsoftdevice, but you do need that third button.andP;  A variety of well-known serial,bus and keyboard mice are supported.andM;A local parallel printer is a good idea but, like any other Unix product,serial devices are well supported.andP;  Intelligent I/O cards are welcomed, too,if you want to hang terminals off your ODT machine to get over a mountain ofdata input.andP;  An Ethernet card helps if you want to make LAN Manager, TCP/IP,NSF and X Windows connections.andM;This review of the beta release of Open Desktop was conducted on a Unisys PW2800/25 with 8Mb of RAM and a Micropolis SCSI hard disk run off a gardenvariety Adaptec controller.andP;  Like all Unix products, ODT sits very close tothe hardware.andP;  The Unisys box was chosen because Unisys is SCO's biggest OEM,thus assuring a well organized support channel for the hardware.andM;PS/2 users can sit back and wait until the PS/2 version of ODT is released.andO;Unix 3.2 needs a bit of massaging for Micro Channel boxes so there'll be aslight delay before IBM aficionados can join in the fun.andM;On the shelfandM;My Open DeskTop developer's kit came to me on a mixture of disks and tapecartridge.andP;  SCO has some interesting plans for the shrink-wrapped versionthough.andP;  Pawing through a pile of floppy disks isn't very satisfactory, soSCO plans to offer Open Desktop in several formats -- including floppy disks.andM;I suspect that a lot of people will opt for the tape cartridge and floppydisk combination, for ease of installation.andP;  There's serious talk in andabout Santa Cruz that the ODT distribution would fit quite nicely on aCD-ROM, along with documentation and some 'searchware' to make it allaccessible.andM;Unix documentation has never been the high point of the operating system.andP;  Ineeded five feet of library shelf for the partial ODT developer's kitdocuments.andP;  Shrink-wrapped Unix indeed!andP;  It took at least an hour to removethe shrink wrapping and get the manuals in order.andM;For the eventual end user, though, less than a foot of shelf space will berequired for the three manuals planned.andP;  Still, I hope that the CD-ROM planscome to fruition quickly because, although the Unix manual can be accessedon-line from within ODT, it would be better for it to be sitting on a CD-ROMthan cluttering up your hard disk.andM;The configuration tangoandM;I can't comment on the installation routine that the first eager customerwill find when the boxes start going on dealer's shelves.andP;  SCO is aware thatit has to be simple and foolproof.andP;  The developer's kit installation was a'no holds barred' bash at setting up a conventional command line Unix.andM;Installation will be semi-automatic.andP;  Prompts for packages to install andpasswords are all that a lucky ODT final edition user will ever have to copewith.andM;On my distribution, however, terminal configuration, adding users, changes indefaults to start Xhibit and starting the Motif window manager were all 'vi'jobs -- vi is the Unix version of EDLIN.andM;There's no escaping the need to twiddle a few things for installing theconnectivity options in the final version, however.andP;  Despite prompt scriptsfurnished by SCO, somebody on-site will have to know their networking.andM;Invasion of the X-wordsandM;Once the setting up is done, the first thing you want to see is PresentationManager for Unix, Xhibit.andP;  Pay close attention now as the story behind whatis on the screen requires a lot of X-words.andM;The graphical basis for the pretty pictures in ODT is X Windows version 11developed by MIT in the US.andP;  OSF's Motif defines a look and feel standard andan API for X Windows.andP;  Xsight is an implementation of X windows and Motif.andO;IXI's X.desktop is rebadged as Xhibit running as XSight.andP;  Whew!andM;No matter what you call it, you're looking at a Presentation Manager clonewith icons.andP;  Clicking and dragging works in the usual way.andM;The screen saver feature gave me a start as it wasn't documented, at leastanywhere I looked!andP;  Otherwise, it was an unremarkable windowing interface,which was the point, I suppose.andP;  I could perform a lot of Unix functions,which would normally have sent me to the reference manuals, simply by usingthe front-end.andP;  I've never been a fan of WIMPs under DOS, but Unix may changethat.andM;The graphics front-end of ODT was still buggy.andP;  The system would crash if youtried to resize a window in the Xman application, on-screen access to theUnix C and ADM documents, and there were peculiar colour changes when you ranDOS Merge in an X window.andP;  There were a few unexplained freezes, too.andP;  It wasusable, if annoying.andM;Unix 3.2andM;A Unix offering from SCO is a change of pace.andP;  Formerly, Xenix was SCO's bigproduct and it may remain so for some time.andP;  SCO felt that for marketingreasons it had to join the mainstream Unix brigade.andP;  SCO Unix System V/386 isbuilt on the official ATandamp;T kernel (which complies with all the variousstandards set up to make big-time computing more open).andM;In addition to the wonders of Unix, Version 3.2 also has built-in Xenixcompatibility.andP;  This means that WordPerfect, Samna and Fenix (a XenixWordStar clone) run, as well as SCO's whole catalogue, from their Lotus cloneProfessional to Microsoft Word.andP;  The SCO Xenix software directory ispotentially lethal if thrown with sufficient force and the Unix list isputting on weight, too.andM;The details of the differences between Unix and Xenix are irrelevant for thebulk of potential users.andP;  ODT is for DOS users who are tired of waiting forOS/2 and want more than what OS/2 is promising, namely, multi-userextensibility and connectivity.andM;If GUIs get you down, there's nothing inherently difficult about command lineUnix.andP;  There are more commands than DOS and those commands often admit longerarguments following them but it's still a manageable thing.andP;  Users, thanks toOS/2, may now have woken up to the fact that to get more than DOScapabilities, more than DOS is required.andP;  ODT at least goes a long way tomeet them via DOS emulation and the window interface.andM;Xenix users will note that Unix 3.2 is less parsimonious with memory.andO;Because of the changes made in order to make this SCO Unix, all of the niftymemory management that was built into Xenix had to go by the wayside.andP;  Asmall-time user used to be able to get by with 2 or 3Mbs.andP;  That's anon-runner as far as 3.2 is concerned.andM;Neither will users get speed by switching from Xenix 2.3.2 to Unix 3.2.andP;  TheUnix version has a lot more freight to pull around and can't compete on speedterms with the lithe Xenix release.andP;  The slower performance is noticeable butnot crippling.andM;In terms of multi-user response, ODT with the Acer File System is undoubtedlyfaster but when a single user is context switching, the performance isn't assharp as good old Xenix.andM;Unprepared DOS users might get stuck in a wait/reset/wait/reset loop if theydidn't know that it can take almost two minutes from hitting the return keyat the boot prompt to the last icon popping out of Xhibit.andP;  ODT i a productthat you either leave running all the time or you make plans for otheractivities while it's sorting itself out in the morning.andM;AFS -- The Acer File SystemandM;There are two ways to make your disk operations faster.andP;  The expensive wayrequires buying a new Winchester disk with a faster access time and moreMbits per seconds.andP;  The cheaper way is to change the file system so thatthings are arranged to come off the disk faster.andM;The Acer file System is just such a critter.andP;  When Taiwanese clone-maker,Acer, acquired California Unix house Counterpoint, they got access to thegoodies which can make even a pokey hard disk look good.andM;The Acer file system uses a proprietary bitmap technique which continuouslyallocates space on the disk.andP;  Acer's Fast File System thereby allows moreinformation to be passed each time the disk is accessed, when compared toother Unix file systems.andM;People who spend large parts of their life closeted with Unix banchmarks saythat the AFS is several times faster than any other Unix file system.andM;ODT has to be pretty facile with its file system services.andP;  Don't forget thatyou can have DOS partitions on the hard disk as well as the occasional Xenixdisk or DOS floppy disk appearing on Drive A or B.andP;  All of the above aresupported transparently.andM;ConnectivityandM;ODT recognizes that the world of independent desktop workstations isfundamentally limited.andP;  In business, networking is the key and several routesto shared resources are built-in.andM;If you're interested in the multi-user versions of ODT, simple asynchronousASCII terminals can be connected but the magical graphical interface issurrendered.andM;The good old 80x25-inch screen can still be best for some jobs, though, andterminal access to ODT's processor can be a good way to knock lengthy dataentry type jobs on the head quickly.andP;  Intelligent I/O cards, like theSpecialix SI family, are supported if you want to tow a gaggle of dumbscreens around your hard disk.andM;TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is a longstandingway of hooking up a variety of computing equipment.andP;  It originated in the USDepartment of Defense but was later adapted for Ethernet and is consequentlyfound around DEC VAX machines in technical or scientific haunts.andP;  Now you canfind it in ODT too.andM;At the moment, 3COM 3C503 and Western Digital 8003e boards are supported, butthose two cover a lot of networks.andP;  3COM 3C501 card support is also availableon request.andM;NFS is an important part of ODT connectivity, too.andP;  NFS stands for NetworkFile System.andP;  It fits neatly into the TCP/IP application layer and layersfive to seven of the ISO/OSI protocols, by the way.andP;  SCO's version is derivedfrom the well-known Lachman System V NFS.andM;Anyone with Sun workstations around would be likely to want NFS but there areother widespread applications, as well.andM;NFS has been designed to be processor, operating system, network architectureand protocol independent.andP;  You can mount directories across a network andthen treat them as local assets.andP;  NFS is implemented with a 'Yellow Pages' tomake administration as straightforward as possible.andM;The Yellow Pages are a distributed look-up table of resources on the networksystem.andP;  You can update one file on one machine and it will go and update theothers automatically.andP;  Unfortunately it went untested, as I didn't have afriendly remote file system and I couldn't find anyone to lend me one.andM;X windows is more than just a graphical interface standard.andP;  There's a strongconnectivity element in any X machine like ODT.andM;Rare terminals called X terminals, which have no processing power butbit-mapped video circuitry, mouse, keyboard and local memory, can be hookedup to an ODT machine and enjoy full graphical interface imagery via Ethernet.andM;They don't swamp the LAN connection like a workstation because they'rebasically communicating on a character, not graphical, basis.andP;  PC Xsight,which is included in the final ODT bundle, manages to turn a PC into an XWindows terminal.andM;SCO would have been remiss if it hadn't tipped its hat at the IBM/Microsoftconnectivity standard bearer, LAN Manager, LMX, the OS/2 Lan Manager-to-UNIXconnectivity option, wasn't available with the latest cut of the developer'skit.andM;It's still being written, much like LAN Manager itself!andP;  As it's unlikelythat there'll be a world full of LAN Manager servers, at least for some time,this is one part that won't be missed initially.andM;DOS emulationandM;SCO has been pushing VP/ix, Phoenix and Interactive's DOS emulator for sometime, but ODT gets the Locus Computing Corporation's DOS Merge product.andP;  Bytaking advantage of the 386's virtual 8086 emulation, DOS Merge is able torun a genuine DOS 3.3 session as a task under Unix.andM;DOS Merge on its own is a well-tested product but making it run underX-Windows is taking longer than anticipated.andP;  The version delivered with theODT developer's kit was buggy in the extreme.andP;  Flight Simulator didn't evenget off the ground.andM;DOS Merge distinguishes itself with very high DOS compatibility with devicedrivers and applications--exceptions are mostly software with 386 in thename.andP;  You can have your own CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT just like in the oldDOS days.andP;  DOS Merge performance is right up there with the original, unlikesome other DOS-under-Unix packages I could mention.andM;In the first edition of ODT, you can't resize the window that DOS Merge isrunning in.andP;  This will change later.andP;  Although DOS Merge on a full screensupports VGA, EGA, CGA, MDA and Hercules, inside the Xterm window you'restuck with Hercules and CGA.andM;DOS Merge performs the DOS under Unix and Unix under DOS trick where DOScommands will work at a Unix prompt and vice versa.andP;  Unix filenames which areunconstrained by the 8+3 DOS rule are translated.andM;Flexibility and configurability are normally a strength, except when theflexing and configuring are done under a hostile operating system.andP;  In theabsence of a polished version of DOS Merge under ODT, I can't say if SCO hasprovided for the punter.andP;  An intelligently chosen set of defaults would go along way.andM;Your RAM budget should be 1Mb per session plus the 4Mb or so required forODT.andP;  However, you can configure DOS sessions of less than 640Kb to get themost out of the RAM which cost an arm and a leg last year.andP;  Demand pagememory support of Unix and the Intel 386 also help get more applications thanyou would think possible in any given megabyte.andP;  If your DOS application canuse EMS, DOS Merge can provide up to 2Mbs.andM;If you haven't already discovered, DOS 4.01 doesn't get along very well withsome software.andP;  Drivers go phut and fall over, strange things happen to someapplications and the 32Mb plus partitions are unrecognizable to Unix or DOSMerge.andP;  If you have 4.01 running, think about a 3.3 refit for ODT purposes.andM;ODT makes no promises about living with OS/2.andP;  Although it's possible to haveDOS, Unix and OS/2 partitions living on a single hard disk, using them may bean fdisk exercise--not the easiest or safest procedure.andM;It's been said before, but here it is again: If all you want is multi-user ormulti-tasking DOS, don't pick Unix.andP;  While DOS Merge delivers bothmultitasking and multi-user DOS, you don't need the restrictions or theoperating system overheads which are bundled with Unix and, by extension,ODT.andP;  Think of DOS Merge as a crutch, not as a total body replacement!andM;PC interfaceandM;Another Locus Computing product that will be in the ultimate ODT shipping boxis PC Interface.andP;  This product allows DOS machines with an Ethernet card totap into the ODT machine and wander about the file system.andP;  It's nocoincidence that PC Interface and DOS Merge share some of the same userattributes, because they share some of the same code.andP;  The access is done ina transparent way, the DOS machine has, in effect, another hard disk.andM;RDBMSandM;Like IBM's OS/2 Extended Edition, ODT has a built-in database.andP;  This is arigorously SQL-compliant program called Ingres/386 SQL.andP;  Like ODT, it's not asingle package.andP;  Included under the Ingres banner are an interactive SQLcomponent, a menu fron-end, report and query-by-forms interface, a reportwriter and an X Windows terminal emulator.andM;Relational Technology is one of the big players in the high-end databasefield along with Informix and Oracle.andP;  Ingres has been dubbed 'the mostrelational database available on a micro'.andP;  It's certainly attracted a lot ofattention by being bundled with Ultrix, which is DEC's Unix flavour.andM;An application developed with Ingres in single user mode can, withoutmodification, be turned loose through ODT's many connectivity paths toinclude information held in other Unix boxes, LANs or mainframes.andM;Ingres was completely absent from the developer's kit and isn't due to arrivefor another three weeks, so I can't report on its function or otherwise atthis time.andM;Also in ODT is ISAM (Indexed Sequential Access Method), an X Open-compliantfile indexing tool, for users who programmed their databases in C.andP;  ISAM isthe standard low-level interface to databases.andM;System administrationandM;There's a new system administrator shell for the poor devil who has to keepall the cogs greased in a multi-user ODT installation.andP;  That said, themenu-driven shell is very easy to use for routine tasks like adding users,configuring printers, making backups and general cleaning duties.andM;The sysadmsh command isn't an all-singing, all-dancing graphical interfacebut it does give straightforward access to the tools needed foradministration.andP;  If you've seen Lotus, you can imagine what the newadministration shell is like.andP;  Arguably, this will be the next target formarauding GUI designers.andM;SecurityandM;Security has often been given short shrift in the Unix world.andP;  SCO hastightened up access beyond the usual log-in/password and file permissionmeasures, so that ODT complies with the C2 class documented in the 'OrangeBook'.andM;Every time you log in, you're shown when your last unsuccessful log-inoccurred.andP;  This provides clues if somebody has tried to hack into your ODTbox.andP;  Passwords can be given expiry dates and users, if permitted, can changetheir password.andM;If you have any hush-hush information, you can use the cryp command toencrypt your confidential files with an algorithm borrowed from the SecondWorld War German Enigma machines.andP;  That's if you can get your hands on a USversion--the paranoiacs in the US won't let a copy of the crypt command outthrough normal channels.andM;Full auditing is provided and is configurable by the system administrator asto how much information is recorded and how reliably it's recorded.andM;Full security implementation can be expensive from a disk and processorresource perspective but if the fate of the free world hinges on your ODTbox, so be it.andM;There's more than hackable software between your system and a cruel world.andO;ODT uses CMOS RAM in your PC to track efforts to break in.andP;  If somebody gainsentry, you'll know about it and there isn't anything that the hacker can doto keep you from finding out about it.andM;AvailabilityandM;ODT will arrive initially as a run-time version for single users.andP;  Actually,the single-user version wil permit one other user to plug in and play.andP;  Thiswill cost 895 pound sterling, a sensible amount of money for the basket ofconnectivity and database management you get with the system.andM;The cost of admission climbs steeply if you want a full multi-user license.andO;Add 1,300 pound sterling to the above for the full tilt multi-user version.andO;Another 1,300 pound sterling increment is necessary to obtain the fulldevelopment system.andM;You can get the single-user run-time at the end of October after ODT'sofficial launch at UNIXexpo in New York.andP;  The delivery date for the other twohas yet to be finalized.andM;SummaryandM;It's difficult to pass a final judgment on a pre-release product.andO;Ultimately, you have to incorporate your expectations of what the deliveredproduct will be like, along with what you actually had running (and crashing)in your machine.andM;That said, Open Desktop looks like a winner.andP;  If SCO gets its sums right fromthe word go, ODT will start strong soon after you have this review in yourhands and keep running, right over the top of OS/2.andP;  SCO should avoid thecustomer beta test that happened with VP/ix.andP;  The Unix community toleratesthat kind of behaviour -- the audience at which Open Desktop is aimedcertainly won't.andM;By being able to draw on Unix, Xenix and DOS software and connect up to justabout any other computer, whether it's PC, mini or mainframe, ODT has all themajor attributes that a sophisticated user could ask for.andP;  Right here andnow.andM;When the green flag drops in late October of this year, OS/2 will barely havemade it to the starting line.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
