Martin Marietta manufactures about 40% of the Patriotair-defense network, which has done so well at interceptingIraqi Scud missiles arriving in Saudi Arabia and Israel.</LP><TEXT>   Although Raytheon is the project's prime contractor --and, as analysts are quick to point out, does most of thelucrative work on the missile -- it is Martin Marietta thatputs together the most expendable part of the system: theprojectile itself. Its Orlando, Fla., factory is now workingaround the clock to assemble more Patriots as the U.S. supplyis depleted.   &quot;They go out the door and straight to the Gulf,&quot; saysPeter Aseritis, a First Boston aerospace analyst who has longbeen bullish on the Bethesda, Md., company. Martin Mariettastock is at 50 3/4, up 1 1/4 yesterday and 12% from beforewhen the bombing began. It is far above the 34 range ofAugust, when Middle East troops were first deployed anddefense stocks were anathema.   But it is the company's horizons beyond the battlefieldthat most excite its backers on the Street. Mr. Aseritis, forone, believes Martin Marietta's wide range of businesses --defense, space, information management and building materials-- are perfectly complementary. Trading at less than seventimes projected earnings, compared with Raytheon's multipleof more than eight, Martin Marietta seems like a great dealto him.   &quot;Martin Marietta is not only going to be a survivor, but Isee every reason for them to continue to gain market share,&quot;adds Judith Comeau, of Goldman Sachs. &quot;I wouldn't hesitate tobuy.&quot;   The company's firm backlog, at $12 billion, is nearlytwice sales-impressive in an industry facing long-term budgetcuts. While many aerospace companies have but a handful ofmajor programs, Martin Marietta is managing almost 1,000contracts at once. The Patriot has provided about $2 billionin business over the past six years, and more foreign ordersfor it now seem certain. The company is a leading maker ofaircraft night-vision and targeting equipment, which hasgotten a boost because of its role in the war. Its Titan IVrocket, which lifts military satellites into the sky, is seenas relatively insulated from the budget squeeze; that programaccounts for about 20% of sales.   Significantly, Martin Marietta hasn't been stung like manyof its rivals by making heedless low-ball bids made onfixed-price development contracts. It has won nearly $40billion in defense work in the past 25 years, but has writtenoff a mere $94 million. General Dynamics registered $500million in charges in the second quarter of 1990 alone.   &quot;We lost a lot of business because we wouldn't makeirrational bids,&quot; says chairman Norman Augustine, &quot;but wehave a healthy balance sheet&quot; as a result. Long-term debt islow, at 23% of total capital. Cash is plentiful. One wart,the Army's ADATS mobile air-defense and anti-tank system, wasdealt with in the fourth quarter, with a $78 million reserveto insulate future earnings.   Not everyone loves the stock. Steven Binder of BearStearns says that if tax rates are compared apples-to-apples,Martin Marietta and Raytheon sell for roughly the sameprice/earnings ratio. He favors Raytheon, which gets 15% ofits revenue from the Patriot. &quot;They clearly benefit more,&quot; hesays. Michael Lauer of Kidder Peabody says Martin Mariettaseems fairly valued at this point. &quot;They have a number ofmature systems,&quot; he says, &quot;and I think they're going to havea tough time replacing them.&quot;   But Jeff Ubben, who manages the Select defense-stock fundfor Fidelity Investments, says Martin Marietta is &quot;exactlythe right place to be if you want to be in the defenseindustry.&quot; Among its promising military projects are theLongbow helicopter targeting and missile system being builtwith Westinghouse, and the AAWS-M shoulder-fired missilebeing developed with Texas Instruments.   In its growing non-military segment, the company recentlywon a $526 million contract to modernize Housing Departmentinformation systems. Mr. Ubben points to a largesand-and-gravel business, a cash cow that should keepexpanding as infrastructure is patched up. Profit margins onthe Titan IV, which Mr. Augustine says should be &quot;flying wellbeyond the year 2000,&quot; are expected to easily hit doubledigits. As the company's chairman likes to say, &quot;We go fromrocks to rockets.&quot;   ---   MCDONNELL DOUGLAS, which earlier wasn't expected to postany fourth-quarter write-offs from the canceled A-12 attackplane program, appears to be reconsidering. Though stillexpected to dispute the contract termination with thePentagon for years, the company now is said to be hinting tothe Street that it may have to take a charge to reflectlosses already sustained on the program, analysts say.McDonnell's accounting firm is Ernst andamp; Young.   ---   Martin Marietta   (NYSE; Symbol: ML)                                                                                                          Business: Defense contractor, aerospace, data management,building materials                                                                                                          Year ended Dec. 31, 1990:   Sales: $6.13 billion   Net income: $327.6 million; $6.52 a share                                                                                                          Fourth quarter, Dec. 31, 1990:   Per-share earnings: $1.17 vs. $1.41                                                                                                          Average daily trading volume: 116,548 shares                                                                                                          Common shares outstanding: 48.8 million</TEXT></DOC>
