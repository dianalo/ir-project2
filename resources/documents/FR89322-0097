(``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'')filed with the Commission a proposed rule change under section 19(b) ofthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''). The proposal provides fornext-day comparison of securities transactions.\1\<NOTE/> Notice of the proposed rule change was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on December 12, 1988, to solicit comments forminterested persons.\2\<NOTE/> No comments were received. This order approves the proposal.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Trade comparison, or the matching of the two sides ofa transaction, is the process after a trade has been executed by whichbroker-dealers confirm with each other the trade's terms (<T3>e.g., </T3>security, number of units, and price) and the existenceof a contract. Comparison is the first of the three major steps in processinga securities transaction (the other two being clearance and settlement).<T3>See </T3>Division of Market Regulation, Securities and Exchange Commission,<T3>The October 1987 Market Break, </T3>Ch. 10 at 2-4 (hereinafter <T3>Division Report</T3>).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26342 (December 6, 1988;53 FR 49949.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Description of the Proposal</ITAG>The proposed rule change consists of new NYSE Rule 130, captioned ``NextDay Comparison of Exchange Transactions.'' Rule 130 generally would requirethat all transactions be compared or closed out by the close of businesson the business day following the trade date (<T3>i.e., </T3>``T+1'').\3\<NOTE/> Under existing NYSE rules, transactions must be comparedor otherwise closed out by T+5.\4\<NOTE/> Thus, the proposal, when implemented, would shorten a transaction'scomparison cycle by four business days. The proposal, however, would haveno effect on the settlement of transactions, the majority of which wouldcontinue to settle on T+5.\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Proposed NYSE Rule 130 would apply only to contracts for``regular way'' (<T3>i.e., </T3>T+5) settlement in stocks, rights, and warrants, as providedin NYSE Rules 64(2), 131, 132, and 133. The rule proposal would not applyto contracts that: (1) Are designated for cash settlement, next day settlement,or seller's option settlement; or (2) involve other securities such asbonds or options.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ <T3>See </T3>NYSE Rule 134.A(f). Currently, NYSE trades typically are comparedon or after the morning of T+2, and an NYSE trade that remains uncomparedafter 2:00 p.m. on T+2 is known as a ``questioned trade,'' or a ``QT.''<T3>See </T3>NYSE Rule 134.A(c); <T3>Division Report, </T3>ch. 10 at 3.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Settlement, the final step in securities processing (followingcomparison and clearance), is the process of exchanging money for securities(<T3>i.e., </T3>delivery and payment) that consummates a transaction. <T3>See Division Report, </T3>Ch. 10 at 2, 5.The NYSE expects to make the proposed rule change effective within 18 monthsafter Commission approval. Accordingly, the Exchange recognizes that thisrule filing is only the first of several steps toward implementation ofits next-day ``compare or close out'' rule.\6\<NOTE/> Moreover, this proposal, in essence, is an enabling rulethat provides a conceptual framework for the proposal's components. Asdiscussed below, each of the major components will be the subject of anindependent rule filing dealing with its operations and its implementation.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ The NYSE notes that apart from the proposal's prospectivesystems development work, the Exchange also must amend, by subsequent filingswith the Commission, certain of its rules, including: NYSE Rule 115A.30(Opening Automated Report Service), and NYSE Rule 134.A (Differences andOmissions_Cleared Transactions (``QT's'')).The NYSE states in its filing that proposed Rule 130 would mandate theuse of a new automated system called the Overnight Comparison System (``OCS''),\7\<NOTE/> which is being developed jointly by NYSE and National SecuritiesClearing Corporation (``NSCC'').\8\<NOTE/> The NYSE further states that OCS mainly will consist of twoautomated sub-systems, both of which are now under development: (1) NYSE'sOn-Line Correction System, and (2) NSCC's Comparison Redesign System. Asa general matter, the NYSE's system will be directed at the automated pairingof trade sides that have not been properly matched, and the NSCC's systemwill be directed at shortening the comparison cycle. This rule filing seeksapproval only for the NYSE's proposed Rule 130, and enabling rule thatembodies the concepts of the On-Line Correction System and the ComparisonRedesign System (T+1 trade comparison).\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ OCS, as proposed, is known in the securities industryby various names and acronyms including: the Next-Day Comparison System,or NDC; the Floor-Derived Comparison System, or FDC; and the T+1 ComparisonSystem, or T+1. These names all refer to the same system.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ For a more operational description of OCS, <T3>see </T3>NYSE Membership Bulletins (May 27, 1988 and July 15, 1988),and NYSE Membership Notice (August 19, 1988). These documents are reprintedin Exhibit B of the instant rule filing at pages 1, 6, and 54, respectively.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ The Commission understands that, within the next few months,the NSCC will file with the Commission under section 19(b)(2) of the Actits own OCS rule proposal for the Redesign System dealing with T+1 comparisonof transactions executed on the NYSE. <T3>See </T3>NSCC Important Notice A3049 (August 19, 1988), reprinted asExhibit B, page 63, of the instant NYSE filing. <T3>See also </T3>letter to all NYSE members from Donald J. Solodar, SeniorVice President, NYSE (August 19, 1988), reprinted as Exhibit B, page 54,of the instant NYSE filing.A. NYSE's On-Line Correction SystemUnder the proposal, NYSE and NSCC would implement OCS in stages. The initialstage would be the introduction of the NYSE's On-Line Correction System(which itself will be implemented in stages) to computerize the adjustmentprocessing of uncompared trades. Specifically, the Correction System wouldautomate: (1) The daily advisory and adjustment cycle currently operatedby NSCC, and (2) the existing QT process currently operated at the Exchangeand processed by NSCC.\10\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ For definition of ``QT,'' <T3>see, supra, </T3>note 4. For definitions of uncompared and advisorytrades, <T3>see, infra, </T3>note 12.The Correction System would replace current paper handling with an on-linedata base of all uncompared trades. The System's terminal screens woulddisplay relevant trade data on the uncompared trades and would permit directentry (by typewriter keyboard) into computer terminals that could sendand receive on-line inquiries. The System also would have the flexibilityto operate within existing comparison time frames or in a more compressedcomparison cycle.Operationally, the On-Line Correction System would work as follows: Terminalswould be installed in the operations areas of clearing firms, specialistfirms, and in NYSE's QT area.\11\<NOTE/> During the evening of T+1, all uncompared trade data wouldbe sent by NSCC to the NYSE, and the NYSE would make the data availableto participants on the morning of T+2, concurrent with NSCC regular-waycontracts.\12\<NOTE/> All firms would be required to stamp ``advisories'' and add,through the System, additional sides for advisories that are participantsecurities.\13\<NOTE/> At the close of business on T+2, NYSE would send all compareditems to NSCC; and on the morning of T+3, these compared items would appearon the NSCC Supplemental Contract Sheet.\14\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ NYSE's QT Center is located at 11 Wall Street.  <ITAG tagnum="28">As noted, the NYSE recommends in its filing that those firms ordinarilyhaving a substantial number of trade adjustments should install terminalsin their operational areas. NYSE further notes, however, that smaller firmsor other firms without a substantial number of adjustments would be ableto process their adjustments by using common terminals and printers inthe NYSE's Post Trade Processing Center, also located at 11 Wall Street.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ On T+2, NSCC currently issues clearing member reports(known as ``contract sheets'') that list: (1) compared trades, (2) uncomparedtrades, and (3) advisory trades. Uncompared trades are trades submittedby a member that have not been matched; and advisory trades are tradessubmitted by the contra-side, against the member, that have not been matched.<T3>See Division Report,</T3> Ch. 10 at 3. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ NSCC has informed the Commission that it would no longeraccept adjustments on securities after they have been integrated into NYSE'sOn-Line Correction System as participant securities. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ As stated above, NSCC is developing a Comparison RedesignSystem, <T3>i.e.,</T3> a new trade comparison system, to assist the NYSE in itsefforts to complete trade comparison by T+1. Under the new NSCC system,NYSE would continue to send its systemized locked-in (automatically compared)trades to NSCC on the evening of the trade date. This process would remainunchanged. <ITAG tagnum="28">The match routine would remain unchanged except for one modification,</ITAG><T3>i.e.,</T3> the addition of a new match element with audit trail data.The remaining four elements of the existing match routine (exact match,summarization, suggested name, and partial suggested name for omnibus accounts)would remain the same. On T+1, NSCC would require its participants to submittheir remaining nonsystemized (``crowd side'') input to NSCC no later than2:00 a.m. New York time. After all participant data has been received,NSCC would begin its initial match routine for these trades. <ITAG tagnum="28">The trade resolution process would begin after particpants receivethe results of NSCC's initial match. NSCC plans to allow participants tosubmit the following adjustments until 12 noon on T+1: deletion of an uncomparedtrade and of a compared suggested name, acknowledgement of any advisory,and as-ofs. At approximately 12 noon on T+1, NSCC will process all adjustmentsthrough an exact match, with the results to be available in a PreliminaryAdjustment Listing at approximately 1:00 p.m. As the Preliminary AdjustmentListing is being distributed to the member organizations, NSCC will generatean uncompared file to QTs for any transactions not yet resolved throughthe NYSE's On-Line Correction System or NSCC's adjustment process. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">Participants then would resolve any open items through OCS. The NYSEwould submit its QTs to NSCC by 5:00 p.m. for subsequent settlement. TheNSCC would generate a Final Adjustment Contract displaying the comparedQTs at approximately 8:00 p.m. For further description of NSCC's ComparisonRedesign System, </ITAG><T3>see </T3>NSCC's Important Notice A3049 (August 19, 1988), reprintedas Exhibit 2, page 63, of the instant NYSE filing. Clearing firms would ensure that all uncompared trades remaining on theirfile by the end of T+2 are valid QTs, which would be submitted to theirQT clerks on the morning of T+3. These items would remain in the OCS file.Additionally, on the morning of T+3, uncompared items would be displayedon the QT terminals for resolution. On normal volume days, QT terminalsand advisory screens would be available from about 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.All submitting clearing firms would have access to the data, but contrafirms would only have the ability to accept or ``Dk'' (indicating theydon't know) the items.\15\<NOTE/> QTs that were resolved through the appropriate key strokeson the terminals would be sent automatically to NSCC for processing.\16\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ NYSE states in its filing that this provision eliminatesthe possibility of the comparison of erroneous trades or of having thetrade terms changed by a contra party. <T3>See</T3> NYSE Rule 134.A(e), for the Exchange's current treatment of``Dks.'' <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\16\ NYSE notes in its filing that as a consequence of thisprocedure no multi-part QT forms will be delivered to Securities IndustryAutomation Corporation for keypunching. All NYSE member organizations having uncompared trades in securities thatare not yet eligible for OCS processing would continue to resolve thesetrades under existing QT rules.\17\<NOTE/> Nevertheless, the NYSE states that as experience is gainedwith the new System, additional securities would be added until all NYSEsecurities are eligible, and eventually the existing QT rules would becomeobsolete. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\17\ <T3>See,</T3> generally, NYSE Rule 134.A for the Exchange's existing rulesgoverning ``QTs.'' B. Implementation Schedule The NYSE recognizes that before it can require its members to compare orclose out transactions by T+1, the systems must be in place (and membersmust be able to use them) to permit routine trade comparison by T+1. Duringlate March 1989, NYSE plans to load clearing member accounts into the On-LineCorrection System. Also, in late March 1989, NYSE plans to load all NYSEsecurities beginning with the letter ``A.'' Thereafter, for a three weekperiod, firms would practice with the system, with the third week involvinglive trades. Gradually, from April through June more letters would be addeduntil all letters (A through Z) has been loaded into the system. When fullyoperation, the Correction System would be able to handle 50,000 to 60,000QTs per day.\18\<NOTE/> Two screens would be available: (1) A clearing firm's screenthat would display all its trade data, and (2) a specialist's screen thatwould display all data on the specialist's securities. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\18\ The NYSE's QTs on T+4 averaged 8,000 per day in the Fallof 1987, and on October 19, 1987, during the Market Break, they peakedat 56,626. <T3>See Division Report,</T3> Table 1, Ch. 10, p. 59. The NSCC's Comparison Redesign System is scheduled for implementation atthe end of June 1989, after the Correction System is fully operational.The NSCC plans to have the Redesign running in May 1989 and to have a shake-outphase in June 1989. While the NSCC hopes to implement the Redesign in Junewith all letters running, it indicates that Redesign's implementation willdepend on the Correction System's being ready and that the NSCC is takinga flexible position with regard to the Redesign's implementation date.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Rationale for the Proposal </ITAG>The NYSE states in its filing that the proposal, by shortening the comparisoncycle for most trades to T+1, would: (1) Increase the efficiency of thepost trade comparison process; and (2) shorten the length of time thatinvestors and NYSE member organizations are exposed to the risk of marketfluctuations on uncompared trades. The NYSE states that, consequently,the proposal would protect investors and the public interest as calledfor in section 6(b)(5) of the Act. Further, the NYSE states that, as required in section 6(b)(5), the proposal,by shortening the comparison cycle, would help: (1) Prevent manipulativeacts and practices; and (2) promote just and equitable principles of tradeand foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating,clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitatingtransactions in securities. The NYSE also emphasizes that the proposalmeets the requirements of section 17A(a)(1) of the Act in that it willenhance the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securitiestransactions. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Discussion</ITAG>The Commission believes that this proposal is consistent with the Act,particularly sections 6(b) and 17A of the Act. The proposed automated comparisonsystem, by shortening the comparison cycle to T+1 from as long as T+5,would reduce the risk exposure to investors and NYSE member organizationsas well as contribute to the prompt and efficient clearance and settlementof securities transactions.\1\\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\9\ The NYSE's proposed On-Line Correction System is comparableto the NASDAQ's Trade Acceptance and Resolution System (``TARS''), whichhas been operating since 1986. TARS was designed to assist its subscribersin resolving and reducing their uncompared and advisory over-the-counter(``OTC'') trades that were being processed through participating clearingcorporations. TARS permits subscribers to view on their terminal screensall the information contained on their daily OTC contract sheets that theyhave received from the clearing corporation and to take actions to resolvethe outstanding items. <T3>See </T3>NASD Market Services, Inc., <T3>Trade Acceptance and Reconciliation Service User Guide </T3>(May 20,1986).<ITAG tagnum="28">The </ITAG><T3>Brady Report </T3>noted that OTC OTs could be resolved by utilizingTARS, whereas listed OTS that could not be reconciled by the buyer andseller required a return to the trading floor for resolution. <T3>See Report of the Presidential Task Force of Market Mechanisms, </T3>StudyVI at 16 (December 1988) (hereinafter <T3>Brady Report</T3>).The Exchange's current proposal marks the first major overhaul to its comparisonsystem since the 1970s. Additionally, the NYSE's proposed On-Line CorrectionSystem will constitute the first phase of the Overnight Comparison System,with the NSCC's Comparison Redesign System to be the second phase.A. General ConcernsThe Commission notes, as a general matter, that the goal of prompt andefficient clearance and settlement of securities transactions (includingthe comparison of securities transactions) and the use of automated systemsin pursuit of this goal are expressly contemplated in section 17A(a)(1)of the Act. Congress stated in that provision that inefficient proceduresfor the clearance and settlement of securities transactions impose unnecessaryrisks and costs on investors and that prompt and accurate clearance andsettlement are necessary for investor protection.Congress further stated in sections 6(b)(5) and 17A(b)(3)(F) that the rulesof exchanges and clearing agencies, respectively, should be designed topromote the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securitiestransactions. Moreover, in section 17A(a)(2) of the Act, Congress directedthe Commission to use its authority to facilitate a natural system forthe prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions.B. The Market Break of October 1987The risks posed by uncompared trades came under intense scrutiny followingthe Market Break of October 1987.\2\\0\<NOTE/> During the Market Break, uncompared trades on the NYSE (aswell as other markets) increased alarmingly and, for several reasons, becamea major stress point in the clearance and settlement process. First, uncomparedtrades required special labor-intensive treatment (``exception processing'')under working conditions already rendered chaotic by record trading volume.\2\\1\<NOTE/> Second, the NYSE's rate of uncompared trades did not remainat its usual percentage of trading volume, but as the NYSE's trading volumeincreased to 2\1/2\ times normal levels during the week of October 19,NYSE's uncompared trades doubled as a percentage of total trades.\2\\2\<NOTE/> And, third, the record market volatility (primarily downward)threatened to impose financial penalties on those firms that could notresolve trade comparison errors quickly, or at any rate before settlementwith their customers on T+5.\2\\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\0\ <T3>See, e.g., Division Report, </T3>Ch. 10 at 5-13; <T3>Brady Report </T3>51-52, Study VI at 48-49; <T3>Interim Report of the Working Group on Financial Markets, </T3>AppendixD at 6 (May 1988) (hereinafter <T3>Working Group Report</T3>).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\1\ <T3>See Division Report, </T3>Ch. 10 at 5. During the market break, toresolve uncompared trades, the NYSE required its member organizations andspecialists to meet: in the mounting before trading opened, in the eveningafter trading closed, and on weekends. The NSCC extended its 6:00 p.m.deadline to as late as 1:00 a.m. for its participants to report the resolutionof unmatched trade sides. Additionally, from October 23 to 30, 1989, theExchange closed trading two hours early to allow firms to catch up on theirback office work. <T3>See Division Report, </T3>Ch. 10 at 9.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\2\ For NYSE executions during the week of October 19,1987, T+2 uncompared trades processed by two-sided comparison increasedfrom an average rate of 4.6% to 9.7% <T3>See Division Report, </T3>ch. 10 at 7.<ITAG tagnum="28">For NYSE executions on October 19 and 20 (the peak volume days with604 million shares and 608 million shares, respectively), T+2 uncomparedtrades for two-sided input increased from an average of 4.6% to 12.6% and10.2%, respectively. In arithmetic terms, however, uncompared trades onT+2 increased from a daily average of 8,000 to 56,626 on October 19 and49,413 on October 20. </ITAG><T3>See id. </T3>Table 10-1 at Ch. 10, p. 59, <T3>See also Brady Report, </T3>Study IV at 48.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\3\ <T3>See Division Report, </T3>Ch. 10 at 5-6. In terms of price volatibility,on Monday, October 19, 1987, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (``FJIA'')closing value had declined a record 508.32 points (22.6%, also a record)from its previous close, i.e., from 2246.74 to 1738.41. After two moredaily reversals of over 100 points, the DJIA closed out the week of Friday,October 23, 1987, at 1950.76, a net 5-day decline (from Friday, October16) of 295.98 points (13.2%). <T3>See id., </T3>Appendix D at Tables 2 and 3.Based on the experience of October 1987, with its unprecedented tradingvolume and price volatility, the Commission concluded that, among otherthings, efficient markets will require same-day, floor-derived trade comparison.\2\\4\<NOTE/> Thus, the NYSE's proposal (which will shrink the comparisoncycle from T+5 to T+1), while it does not constitute the final objectiveof same-day comparison, is consistent with the Commission's desire to shortenthe comparison cycle. The NYSE's proposed next-day comparison likewiseis consistent with the <T3>Working Group Report, </T3>which concluded that the development ofon-line trade matching systems would enhance the capacity of market participantsto monitor their intra-day exposure.\2\\5\<NOTE/> The proposal also is consistent with the intermarket clearingand credit mechanisms espoused by the <T3>Brady Report </T3>to reduce market exposure to clearing corporations.\2\\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\4\ <T3>See </T3>Securities and Exchange Commission Recommendations regardingthe October 1987 Market Break, contained in Testimony delivered by DavidS. Ruder, Chairman, SEC, before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housingand Urban Affairs, 23-24 (February 3, 1988). <T3>See also Division Report, </T3>Ch. 10 at 12; <T3>Working Group Report, </T3>Appendix D at 6.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\25\ The <T3>Working Group Report </T3>called for same-day, floor-derived comparisonof securities transactions. <T3>See Working Group Report, </T3>Appendix D at 6.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\6\ <T3>See Brady Report </T3>at 64-65.Accordingly, the Commission favors the efforts of this proposal to reducethe Exchange's trade comparison cycle by four business days, from T+5 toT+1. The Commission expects too that the NYSE will consider its currentlyproposed next-day comparison system not to be a final goal but only a near-termphase in its efforts toward the development and implementation of same-day,floor-derived comparison of NYSE transaction.\2\\7\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\7\ The Commission's staff has met with the NYSE's staffand discussed at length the technical and other problems associated withthe NYSE's change to a same-day floor-derived comparison system. The Commissionis cognizant of the various concerns, including: (1) The need for furthersystems development to handle efficiently the Exchange's level of tradingvolume; (2) the need to install terminals for a floor-derived comparisonsystem on the trading floor itself and the current lack of any availablespace on the trading floor; (3) the probable need for an expanded clericalstaff to operate such a system; (4) the potential disruptions to Exchangeoperations during the phasing-in period; and (5) the scope and financialcost of the undertaking. <ITAG tagnum="28">The Commission also notes that several regional exchanges (</ITAG><T3>e.g., </T3>the Options Floor of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange) alreadyhave floor-derived comparison systems in operation on their trading floors.With these systems, all trades are matched on the floor at the time ofexecution. Such automated systems, by locking-in the trade data in thismanner, can almost totally eliminate uncompared trades. <T3>See Division Report, </T3>Ch. 10, note 1 and 2. C. <T3>Comment Letters to NYSE </T3>The Commission recognizes that the NYSE's trade comparison process, inorder to operate smoothly, requires cooperation from many different parties,including: executing brokers (whether house brokers or two dollar brokers),specialists, floor clerical staff, clearing members, service bureaus, theExchange's staff, the NSCC, and Securities Industry Automation Corporation.Under these circumstances, the Commission believes that comments from memberorganizations and other sources are important to the success of this effortand deserve special attention from the NYSE and the NSCC. While the Commission has received no comments in response to its noticeof this proposal in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, the NYSE reported in its filing that it hadreceived 36 comment letters in response to its May 27, 1988 MembershipBulletin. Of those 36 comments (33 from NYSE member organizations, onefrom a correspondent broker, and two from trade organizations): (1) 24commentators favored the proposal; (2) eight commentators favored the proposal,but provided added suggestions or questions; and (3) two commentators opposedthe proposal. Most significantly, two commentators suggested that the proposalleaves too many operational details to future determination, and two commentatorssuggested that the proposal would favor large brokerage firms and New YorkCity brokerage firms over other firms.\2\\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\8\ One commentator suggested that among the many basicquestions the proposal leaves to future interpretative releases are: Whatwould be a clearing firm's responsibilities for the firms it clears for?If a clearing firm clears for a market maker, would the clearing firm beresponsible for the market maker's trades? If so, could the clearing firmset position and trading limits? The Commission believes that these questions,while important, are not critical aspects of Rule 130, which is an enablingrule, and that these issues properly should be dealt with in the comingrules of implementation. <ITAG tagnum="28">Another commentator questioned how OCS would be phased in, notingthat the Exchange prefers a one-step change from T+5 to T+1, which wouldrequire only one system modification; but that his firm would prefer astep-by-step change (T+3 to T+2 to T+1) to lessen problems of night personnelrecruitment and the re-scheduling of computer time. The Commission hasdiscussed this issue with the staffs of NYSE and NSCC. Whether the comparisoncycle should be reduced in one step or several steps from T+5 to T+1 remainsthe subject of continuing analysis. Again, however, this matter is notan issue of the current proposal. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">Thirdly, two smaller brokerage firms have suggested that the OCS proposalfavors New York City firms and national firms over smaller Midwest andWest Coast retail firms whose customers tend to hold their own securitiescertificates. These firms apparently sense that shortening the comparisoncycle forecasts an eventual shortening of the settlement cycle, which coulddisadvantage firms lacking New York delivery capabilities. The Commissionis sensitive to the concern that this proposal might favor large firmsor New York firms over other firms. But the Commission notes that the Exchange'sdevelopment of a more efficient trade comparison system could not be prohibitedsolely on the ground that it might lead to a shorter settlement cycle.</ITAG>The Commission understands that the Exchange has involved many of thesecommentators in its deliberations on systems design and implementation.The Commission commends the Exchange for its early involvement of key userrepresentatives.In determining whether this proposal is consistent with the Act, the Commissionhas reviewed all the comment letters to the NYSE.\2\\9\<NOTE/> The Commission finds that the comments suggesting that theproposal leaves too many of its operational aspects to future determinationare without merit. While it is true that proposed Rule 130 and its companionreleases do not provide the full operating details of this far-reachingproposal, it also is true that the proposal intentionally was submittedto the Commission as an enabling rule that later would be supplementedby rules of implementation governing the proposal's sub-systems and theiroperations.\3\\0\<NOTE/> Secondly, the Commission finds the two comments suggestingthat the proposal would favor large brokerage firms and New York City firmsover other firms to be unsubstantiated and likewise without merit. TheCommission believes that the proposal is consistent with the Act in allrespects. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\9\ The Commission's staff has contacted, either by telephoneor personal visit, most of the commentators who offered suggestions, raisedquestions, or objected to this proposal.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\0\ In this connection, the Commission notes that on March6, 1989, it received from the NYSE two rule proposals concerning its On-LineCorrection System (File Nos. SR-NYSE-89-3 and SR-NYSE-89-04) providingfor the implementation of the Exchange's new system for the electronicresolution of uncompared transactions. D. SummaryThe Commission believes that the proposed rule change, by shortening theNYSE's comparison cycle from T+5 to T+1, would make the NYSE's comparisonprocess: (1) Safer with regard to the risks of market price volatility,and (2) more efficient in terms of the time and expense involved in tradeprocessing. The Commission further believes that the proposal would helpprotect investors and that it also would help protect the brokers and otherpersons that safeguard investors' funds and facilitate their transactions.In the Commission's opinion, this rule change will provide fundamentaland important improvements to the marketplace. Moreover, the Commissionbelieves that the proposal is consistent with the Act, particularly sections6(b)(5) and 17A of the Act, and that it warrants approval. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Conclusion</ITAG>For the reasons discussed in this order, the Commission finds that theproposed rule change is consistent with the Act and the rules and regulationsthereunder.
