Those needs are mostevident in connection with development of new types of floating and fixedoffshore platforms for marginal oil fields, and for oil fields at deepwater or in arctic regions. Some of the new concepts for platform aredescribed in the paper. Safe, economical and efficient design of newtypes of platforms calls for more accurate and efficient methods of computationalmechanics than the ones that we have today. The paper points to areasin which new developments are particularly needed. Examples of largescale linear analysis as well as nonlinear analysis by use of the finiteelement method are given.</TEXT></DOC>
