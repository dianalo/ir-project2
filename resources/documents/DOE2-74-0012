The mosteconomical path is heat from waste biomass (agriculture, forestry). Dependingon fuel oil price, energy plantation is feasible depending on the localsituation with the important side effect to diminish the financing problemsof the disturbed agricultural market and the so-called worldwide ''surplusproduction'' of food. Developing countries get a chance to export concentratedfuels from biomass. Systems of power generation are multivarious fromplant oil, ethanol and methanol for cars, lorries and tractors to pyrolysisoil for external combustion and vapour engines and syngas utilizationin gas motors. The costs vary in a wide range depending on the localsituation, but generally it can be concluded that heat and power frombiomass is cheaper than energy from many other renewable and conventionalsources favoured by industry, utilities, trade, politicians and researchinstitutions, especially, when considering the positive side effects.</TEXT></DOC>
