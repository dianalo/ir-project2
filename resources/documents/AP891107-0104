RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court was told today that jailinga parent for refusing to disclose the whereabouts of a child whomay be abused or even dead is a necessary penalty to enforcesociety's duty to protect defenseless children.   ``Where will we be if the state cannot enforce'' such orders,asked Assistant Attorney General Ralph S. Tyler of Maryland. ``Willthe most effective remedy (for assuring children's safety) be takenaway?''   The court, in the case of a Baltimore woman jailed for refusingto say where her son is, engaged in a spirited one-hour discussionof the rights of children and constitutional safeguards againstself-incrimination.   Tyler argued that Jacqueline Bouknight, in jail for more than 18months for refusing to disclose her son's whereabouts, is not beingdenied her rights against self-incrimination protected by the FifthAmendment.   Allowing the Fifth Amendment to outweigh the child's welfarecould hamstring juvenile courts, Tyler said.   ``She has never claimed she cannot comply with the order, butthat she need not comply,'' Tyler said. ``That is a dangerousextension of the Fifth Amendment.''   But Bouknight's lawyer, George E. Burns, said the authoritieshave another alternative to jailing the parent indefinitely forcontempt of court.   She could be prosecuted under a child neglect law that carries athree-year prison term, he said.   ``It's not true that the state can do nothing,'' Burns said.``It's not a matter of `we can't do it. We just won't do it'.''   Child welfare groups and numerous state and local officialsjoined in urging the court to uphold Bouknight's indefinite jailing.   The mother's ``interest in avoiding any possibility ofself-incrimination simply does not outweigh the state's interestand its obligation to protect'' the child, said a coalition ofgroups representing gorvernors, mayors and other officials.   The groups include the U.S. Conference of Mayors and theNational Governors' Association.   Social workers last saw Bouknight's son, Maurice, in September1987 when he was 11 months old. They fear he may be dead.   Maurice was admitted to a Baltimore hospital on Jan. 23, 1987,when he was three months old for treatment of a broken leg andother injuries.   Suspecting the infant had been abused, social workers putMaurice in foster care and later obtained a court order giving thecity protective custody of him.   City officials said Bouknight suffered from emotional problemsand was observed throwing Maurice into his crib during the infant'shospitalization.   Maurice was returned to his mother's custody on July 17, 1987,after she agreed not to punish him physically and to undergotraining in parenting skills.   But nine months later, the social workers said Bouknight nolonger was cooperating with them. Moreover, they said Maurice'sfather recently had been shot to death and Bouknight was usingdrugs.   The mother was held in contempt of court by a judge on April 28,1988, after she refused to disclose Maurice's whereabouts.   The Maryland Court of Appeals ruled in December that jailing herfor refusing to disclose the information violates herconstitutional protection against self-incrimination.   But Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist suspended the effect ofthat ruling and prevented her from going free while the SupremeCourt reviewed the case.   Some have compared the Bouknight case to that of ElizabethMorgan, who was released from prison on Sept. 25. The Washington,D.C., doctor was behind bars for more than two years for refusingto let her daughter visit the girl's father, Morgan's formerhusband.   Morgan went to jail rather than produce the girl, now 7, forcourt-ordered visits with the father. Morgan accused her formerhusband of sexually abusing the child, charges he consistently hasdenied.   Among other groups supporting the contempt order againstBouknight are Advocates for Children and Youth, the JuvenileProtective Association and the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation.   The case is Baltimore Department of Social Services vs.Bouknight, 88-1182.</TEXT></DOC>
