Constitution: During dry storage of spent fuels under driedatmosphere, if defects are present in the fuel can, oxygen may intrudeto the inside to oxidized UO/sub 2/ pellets. In view of the above, gettersare constituted with a hydrogen-absorbing zirconium alloy and an oxygen-catcher(Mg, Zn, Sn, FeII), to thereby prevent oxidation. Thus, since oxygenintruding into the fuel can forms oxides with highly reductive metalsbefore reaction of UO/sub 2/ pellets and oxygen, swelling of fuel pelletsdue to oxidation during dry storage can be hindered to prevent the failureof the fuel can.
