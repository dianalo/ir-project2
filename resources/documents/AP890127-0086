In a statement Thursday, Foreign Ministry officials acknowledgedthey knew about plans for the 5-foot-deep, 14-foot-wide ditch alongthe San Diego-Tijuana border. But they said they had been told itwas to solve rainwater drainage problems on the flat Otay Mesa,along the international border.   ``The Mexican government was not told the purpose of thisconstruction could be to control migration, or anything else of thatnature,'' the statement said.   Several Mexican congressmen reacted angrily to the proposal,calling it ``unfriendly'' and saying it would not stop the flow ofillegal immigrants.   In the United States, immigrant rights activists called it``repressive'' and ``ill-conceived.''   The $2 million ditch, which Associate Attorney General Francis A.Keating II likened to a ``buried Berlin Wall,'' will traverse anarea east of San Ysidro, Calif., that is a major route for drugsmuggling and border crossing.   Keating said the primary purpose of the ditch would be todiscourage drug smugglers from driving cars and trucks across theborder.   Although the Mexican government expressed no opinion on theproposal, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari is among those who saythe U.S. policy of exclusion fails to recognize that emigrants fromMexico are filling a need by taking jobs that most Americans don'twant.   Immigration experts say the isolated Otay Mesa is the mostpopular crossing point for illegal immigrants along the 1,950-mileU.S.-Mexico border.   About one third of the 1.2 million illegal immigrants capturedalong the border last year were apprehended at Otay Mesa. Officialssay up to 400 vehicles are believed to cross the border illegallyinto San Diego each month.   The Foreign Ministry said the ditch had been discussed by theInternational Boundary and Water Commission as a remedy for areaflooding problems. But it said the commission, which includesmembers from both countries, never talked about the project as abarrier to drug traffickers or illegal immigrants.   ``Both governments, through their respective commissioners, havebeen consulted about ways of resolving the problem of drainage ofrain waters,'' the statement said.   ``The construction of this ditch is only one of many proposalsthat have come before the commission and in no moment was itapproved by the two governments,'' it said.   The Excelsior news service on Thursday quoted Deputy GuadalupeGomez Maganda, president of the foreign relations committee, assaying the proposal was ``unfriendly.'' Gomez Maganda reportedlysaid he would bring the matter up at the next interparliamentarymeeting on U.S.-Mexico relations.   Deputy Alberto Ling Altamirano of the conservative NationalAction Party said the proposal ``isn't so much aggressive as it issilly.''   ``They aren't going to stop anyone while there are hungry peoplein Mexico and there is a clandestine labor market in the UnitedStates,'' he said.   The government news service Notimex also criticized the proposalin an editorial, calling it ``a violent call to the attention of theMexican government and to all political and social groups interestedin the defense of sovereignty and national dignity.''   In Washington on Thursday, a private group lobbying to stem theflow of illegal immigrants proposed charging a $2 fee to enter thecountry and using the money to tighten border security.   The non-profit group, the Federation for American ImmigrationReform, said the estimated $500-$600 million a year in revenue fromthe fees should go toward intensified patrols of the U.S.-Mexicoborder and replacement of 28 miles of metal fence.</TEXT></DOC>
