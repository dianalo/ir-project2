Now they are ready to share it in hopes of healing awounded world.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Religion andamp; Ethics  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  HEALING A WOUNDED WORLDINDIA'S JAINS SHARE THEIR PHILOSOPHY OF NON-VIOLENCE  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     &quot;The planet is on the brink of ecological disaster; the world has become aspiritual slum,&quot; said N. P. Jain, a prominent Indian scholar and diplomat whowas keynote speaker at a Stanford University conference that drew more than5,000 participants last weekend -- the largest Jain gathering held outsideIndia.;    &quot;Up to now, Jainism has been confined to the borders of India, butthe torch has been lit in the West,&quot; Jain told the gathering, which wassponsored by the Jain Association of North America, which claims 40,000members in the United States and Canada.;    &quot;We must be interfaith catalystsin the world community,&quot; added L.M. Singhvi, an eminent jurist and humanrights activist who is India's ambassador to the United Kingdom. &quot;We mustpromote the science and technology of non-violence. We must engage in peacefulcampaigns for ecology and against intolerance. Ours is an ancient belief, butit is also a religion for tomorrow and the day after tomorrow.&quot;;    Singhvi isthe author of the &quot;Jain Declaration on Nature,&quot; a statement on Jain beliefsand ecology that was presented last October to Britain's Prince Philip, whoheads the Worldwide Fund for Nature. Singhvi's declaration marked Jainism'sformal entry in an interfaith effort by Jews, Christians, Muslims, Buddhists,Hindus and Bahais to provide a spiritual dimension to the environmentalmovement.;    Jain (pronounced &quot;Jane&quot;) philosophy is widely misunderstood inthe West, where it has been characterized as a sub-sect of Buddhism orHinduism. In fact, Jainism predates both religions, with roots reaching to theninth century B.C. The word Jain means &quot;follower of the Jinas,&quot; human teacherswho periodically appear throughout history to preach an unchanging message ofnon-violence, compassion and self-restraint. The most recent of thoseteachers, Mahavira, was a contemporary of the Buddha and lived in NorthernIndia in about 500 B.C.;    Jains worship no deity and seek no converts. Theyfocus instead on the transformation of the individual soul from bondage tobliss through self-discipline, meditation -- and above all -- the practice ofnon-violence.;    Respect for all organisms;  In Jain belief, all organisms --from the smallest amoeba to the most highly evolved human -- possess a soulthat has a right to evolve undisturbed over many lifetimes on its journey tospiritual perfection.;    Jains are strict vegetarians who consume neithermeat, fish nor eggs. They are ardent pacifists.;    A guiding principle is toinflict as little harm as possible. Jains do not wear leather, for instance,and they avoid silk because hundreds of silkworms die to make the cloth. Womenavoid wearing pearls because they are taken from living oysters. Jainsgenerally wear cotton or synthetics.;    Jainism is a non-hierarchicalreligion, whose monks and nuns are considered to play an equal role with thelaymen and women who support them. Jains reject the Hindu caste system thatpermeates Indian society, and they insist on equality of the sexes.;    Thefive vows;  The Jain code of conduct requires five vows of its adherents:;   (check) To practice non-violence in thought, word and deed.;    (check) Toseek and speak the truth.;    (check) To be honest and never take anything byforce or theft.;    (check) To practice self-restraint and chastity.;   (check) To practice non-acquisitiveness.;    Though it is uncompromising inits insistence on non-violence, Jainism has no sanctions against birthcontrol. And though Jains are politically influential in India, they havemounted no opposition to abortion there as pro-life Christian denominationshave done in the United States.;    &quot;Jainism doesn't say to its adherents,'Thou shalt not . . .' But we seek to minimize violence in our own lives,&quot;explains Giresh Shah, a San Jose businessman who was one of the organizers ofthe Stanford gathering. &quot;And if one of our members does not practicenon-violence -- by eating meat, for example, or having an abortion -- we wouldrespond with compassion, not condemnation. We would say 'what a pity,' but wewould not kick them out or try to outlaw anyone's actions.;    &quot;Our idea isnot to indulge in things with passion,&quot; he adds. &quot;For instance, many marriedJain couples take a vow of celibacy at a certain point in life as a spiritualdiscipline.&quot;;    Death with support;  Death is another issue in which Jainshave a different point of view. In the West, death is regarded as an unwelcomeexperience, but often in Jainism, when a person becomes old or infirm, a vowto refuse all food and drink is often taken under the guidance of a monk. Inthat way death is a willful action undertaken with the support of the familyand the religious community.;    Though their numbers are small in India --less than 2 percent of the total population -- Jains wield considerablepolitical, social and economic clout. Pragmatic and well-educatedcity-dwellers, Jains tend to be doctors, lawyers, educators, scientists ormerchants. Many of the local Jains attending the Stanford conference were bookpublishers, engineers and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs.;    &quot;The honesty ofJain business people is legendary. So is their genius for making a profit andso is their charity,&quot; says Giresh Shah. By some estimates, Shah says, Jainsgenerate one-half of India's gross national product and finance one-third ofits charities, from research hospitals and kitchens to feed the hungry toshelters for sick and abandoned animals.;    &quot;We are well-to-do in partbecause we are pragmatists and in part because of our philosophy, whichaccommodates a multiplicity of viewpoints,&quot; he says. &quot;We live and let live,always with compassion.&quot;;    Western influence;  But living and letting liveis not easy in the modern world -- for Jains or anyone else. One of the primeconcerns expressed at the three-day Stanford conference was how emigrant Jainsliving in the West pass their heritage on to their children, who have beenborn and bred in a culture where vegetarianism must compete with McDonald'sand Taco Bell, where worth is measured by possessions, and whereself-expression is more highly valued than self-restraint. One of the biggestissues is intermarriage with non-Jains -- something that parents oppose, butthat assimilated sons and daughters consider part of their American heritage.;   &quot;Sometimes it's hard. You want to go along with what your friends aredoing,&quot; says 14-year-old Laju Shah of Hayward. &quot;And a lot of us think ourparents should loosen up and allow us to adapt on issues like dating. But thatkind of thing takes time. I think that ultimately you can be Jain and be anAmerican, too.&quot;;    Younger generation;  Sushil Kumar is an acharya -- a monk,a peacemaker and an internationally respected Jain teacher. He founded asociety to protect cows from slaughter in India; he has chanted mantras in theNazi death camp at Auschwitz in recent years and, last year, attempted to goto Iraq to try and persuade Saddam Hussein to pull his troops out of Kuwait.;   Despite war, violence and ecological ruin, Sushil Kumar regards the youngergeneration of American-born Jains as a special kind of catalyst able to bringthe concept of non-violence to bear on the problems of the world.;    &quot;The40,000 Jains who live in this country are the cream who left India for abetter life. And their children are the cream of the cream,&quot; Kumar says.&quot;Sooner or later, they will be influenced by their parents' beliefs. Withoutnon-violence, the world cannot survive. It is our only hope. These childrenhold the hope in their hands.&quot;;  IF YOU'RE INTERESTED;    For more informationabout Jain philosophy, contact Chendra Bhandari at the Jain Center of NorthernCalifornia, (408) 356-6602.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  JOAN CONNELL, Mercury News Religion andamp; Ethics Editor  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910713  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  DRAWING; PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,387  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday July 13, 199100195136,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
