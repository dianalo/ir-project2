Lilley,said Sunday it would be a ``terrible mistake'' for the United Statesto give up on maintaining relations with China despite the Beijinggovernment's harsh crackdown on the democratic reform movement.   Lilley said U.S. policy toward China needs to respond to theimmediate situation there but also take a long-term approach ratherthan seek any kind of ``quick fix.''   The envoy's comments came in a telephone interview from Beijingbroadcast on the CBS program ``Face the Nation.''   ``I think we've gone through many ups and downs with China, and Ithink right now we're going through a down,'' Lilley said. ``But Idon't think we should sort of give up on it. I think that would be aterrible mistake.''   He said the United States can continue to have some influence inChina through avenues including Voice of America broadcasts,training of Chinese students and ``in the multitude of businessdecisions that are made every day on the basis of investment climateand trading atmosphere.''   ``What we do is we play for the long term, and we don't look fora quick fix. ... We look for a long term solution. And I thinkthat's what we're working towards,'' Lilley said.   The ambassador was asked about leading Chinese dissident FangLizhi, who has taken refuge in the U.S. embassy in Beijing and isseeking political asylum.   Lilley responded: ``I would prefer not to discuss that situation.I will say that I have had conversations with them (Chineseofficials) in the last two or three days. ... It's a very sensitivething, and it's best to do it and shut up.''   Lilley gave no indication during the interview that he was awarethe Chinese government had issued an arrest warrant for Lizhi andhis wife, Li Shuxian, on charges of ``committing crimes ofcounterrevolutionary propaganda and instigation.''   Asked if the Chinese had approached U.S. officials about the twodissidents, Kenneth Bailes, a State Department spokesman refused tocomment on the report and on any aspect of the situation.   Upon arrival at the White house from the Camp David weekendretreat, esident Bush declined to give a reaction to the Chinesedemand.   As reporters shouted questions he cupped his hand to his ear andsaid: ``I can't hear a thing. This is not an appropriate time.''   The head of an organization supporting U.S.-China trade andbusiness ventures said American companies should first take steps toensure the safety of their personnel in China, then carefullyreassess their business prospects.   Roger Sullivan, president of the U.S.-China Business Council,said that in the short term, ``Nobody's talking about business asusual. Business with China has been devastated, and it's veryimportant for us to bring home to the Chinese people that theirgovernment did it.''   He estimated that up until the current turmoil, the Americanbusiness presence in China totalled 8,000 to 9,000 people, withabout 300 U.S. companies having investment contracts worth $3.4billion.   ``Companies are taking their people out. That's the first thingto do. I mean you've got to protect the safety and security of yourpeople, and then take a long look at and test your assumptions abouthow you're going to be able to continue _ if indeed you're going tobe able to continue at all,'' Sullivan said.   Also appearing on the CBS program was Sen. Alfonse D'Amato,R-N.Y., who said he expects to see congressional action within thenext 10 days on economic sanctions against China, including a cutoffof high technology.   D'Amato said the United States should act as a ``catalyst'' inpromoting multilateral sanctions against China by Western Europeancountries and Japan.   Rep. Stephen J. Solarz, D-N.Y., chairman of the House ForeignAffairs subcommittee on Asian and Pacific affairs, also endorsed astrategy of seeking multilateral economic sanctions.   Interviewed on CNN's ``Newsmaker Sunday,'' Solarz said the UnitedStates should deprive China of ``any special concessions or creditswhich they've been receiving in the past which we ordinarilywouldn't give to a communist regime which engages in the fundamentalabuse of the human rights of its own people.''   Solarz was asked about the question of maintaining electroniclistening posts in China which help monitor Soviet missile tests.   He responded that ``in terms of the listening posts, I believethat those are mutually beneficial and so I don't think we need tobe overly concerned about them.''</TEXT></DOC>
