Foreign Minister Sosuke Uno called the bill ``problematical,''and said Japan strongly hoped the Reagan administration ``willcontinue to oppose protectionism.''   A Foreign Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity,said Japan had ``serious concerns'' about the bill, and he hopedthe United States ``will stick to the rules'' governinginternational trade.   The government's chief spokesman, Keizo Obuchi, told a newsconference the passage of the bill was regrettable and expressedhope Reagan will veto the legislation. The bill must still pass theSenate.   ``The government hopes the Reagan administration will fightprotectionism and that this protectionist bill will not beenacted,'' Obuchi said.   Joichi Aoi, president of Toshiba Corp., said the bill unfairlysingles out his company for a subsidiary's sale of high-technologymachine tools to the Soviet Union. The sale was made in violationof the rules of the Coordinating Committee for Export Control, amultilateral agreement regulating the flow of Western technology tocommunist nations.   U.S. officials have charged that the machine tools, sold byToshiba Machine Co., helped the Soviet Union build quietersubmarine propellers.   ``Our position has been that any U.S. sanctions against aforeign firm for violating COCOM regulations would be contrary tothe principle of COCOM, which holds that transgressors of theexport regulations must be punished under the laws of theindividual countries where the incidents occur,'' Aoi said.   The Toshiba provision in the trade bill calls for barringToshiba Corp. from sales to the U.S. government for three years,and prohibits Toshiba Machine Co. from all exports to the UnitedStates for the same duration.   Other Japanese business leaders also expressed regret over theHouse action, saying it would have an adverse effect on Japan-U.S.relations.   Takashi Ishihara, president of the Japan Association ofCorporate Executives, called the vote short-sighted and untimelybecause it came only a few days after the release of Japan's tradefigures for June, which showed a rapid decline in the country'strade surplus with the United States.   The Foreign Ministry official said the trade bill as drafteddoes not violate regulations of the General Agreement on Tariffsand Trade, an international trade body. But he said the billcontains enough enforcement latitude to allow possible violation ofGATT rules in practice.</TEXT></DOC>
