(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Would-be super athletes who take onprojects like bicycling across the country are psychologicallypretty much like the rest of us, but may offer some clues onhandling daily stress, researchers say.   ``We look at sports as a way to look at other things in lifethat are harder to study,'' said James Whelan, a Memphis StateUniversity psychologist and part of a team studying riders in theannual Race Across America.   Even though they voluntarily take on the grueling challenge,riders aren't psychologically unusual, said Andrew Myers, the studydirector. ``We thought we'd find that they were all crazy but thedata just doesn't support that.''   The racers ride for 10 days with one to two hours of sleep anight, conditions producing what Whelan and Myers say produces aunique source of study subjects under extreme physical andemotional stress.   ``These people reported some rather serious psychologicaldisturbances during the race,'' Whelan said. ``There wereperceptual distortions.   ``For example, they would see trees get up and move, which theyknew wasn't happening and it was bizarre to them. A fair number atdifferent times during the race would actually hallucinate _ they'dsee dragons coming out of the woods. For some riders, their abilityto see the world around them was so impaired they had to stopriding for a period of time.''   The researchers still are evaluating data from the 1988 and 1989races, but Whelan said some factors already stand out on dealingwith stress. Riders who could concentrate on the task, set andachieve reasonable interim goals and rely emotionally on theirsupport teams generally came out best.   ``Among those who finished the race, we found that their skillsin concentration and mental preparation and motivation mediatedtheir emotional deterioration,'' he said. ``What we're talkingabout here is not just are they more motivated but do they have theskills to keep themselves motivated. You can be real motivated atthe start but 1,500 miles into the race, when you're hitting100-degree days, how do you keep yourself into what you're doing?''   The racers learned the needed skills through years of trainingand competition, but they can be taught to non-athletes, ``... inparticular how they plan for something, how concentrated they areon the task, how well they're able to keep themselves motivated,how well they're able to deal with anxieties and worries and theirability to depend on others for support and encouragement,'' hesaid.   Riders participating in the study filled out questionnaires atthe beginning and end of the races and also were questioned atvarious stages along the 3,000-mile route. Research assistantsconducted the in-race surveys hanging out the window of a chasevan. As one would expect, they found that the mood of the ridersdeteriorated dramatically as the race wore on. Twenty-six of the 34riders in 1988 took part in the study and 20 of the 27 riders in1989.   ``People just get involved in seeing how far they can ride andthis is an ultimate challenge,'' Whelan said. ``They're prettynormal folks who become focused on this sort of activity. Theydream about whether they can cross the country and how fast theycan do it, but they're no different from any other sort of athleteor other people who enter a hobby and become really involved init.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Dec. 4</NOTE></DOC>
