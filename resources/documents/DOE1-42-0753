While the Yankee SPDS performs well in thiscapacity, the data it collects can be useful in many other applications.In order to utilize the information available, the utility is now developingthe Yankee Trend Monitoring System which makes use of the SPDS data base.This system will be used to monitor the important thermal-hydraulic parametersto provide an early indication of any abnormal trends. Other possibleuses of the SPDS data include the validation of plant models used inthe safety analyses. The data can be used in operator training, and mayalso be helpful in improving plant performance. Data from plant transientscan be used to assist in the post-trip review process. The SPDS may alsobe used to predict changes in reactivity to assist the operators in plantcontrol. The SPDS is a valuable tool for the operators during accidentconditions. However, the information available through the SPDS can alsobe used for many other purposes. This paper discusses only a few of themany possibilities.</TEXT></DOC>
