August delivery gold rose $4 an ounce to $372.40 aftertrading as high as $375.50. September silver was up 1.5 centsan ounce at $4.87. October platinum advanced $2.90 an ounceto $485.80.</LP><TEXT>   Gold turned in a particularly solid performance. TheAugust contract never fell below Tuesday's close; even at theday's low of $370, it was up $1.60.   Gold's advance slowed in the afternoon, when the Augustcontract reached its high for the day. Resistance thendeveloped and the price slipped.   In addition to the technical resistance, some selling wasstimulated by a lessening of tensions in the Middle East.Iraq and Kuwait agreed to meet in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, overthe weekend to resolve their dispute over the amount of oilthat Kuwait is producing and other matters.   A stronger dollar in the afternoon also contributed to theweakness, analysts said.   According to Sharon Ziemian, vice president of Citibank,New York, the activity for the most part appears to be frommajor traders with &quot;deep pockets,&quot; with little speculativeparticipation.   &quot;This has created a combination of short covering, whichwas very evident Monday and has continued, and new buying bythese interests, which has given the market strong underlyingsupport,&quot; Ms. Ziemian said.   &quot;Speculators may be exercising caution after having seenlower markets and they are looking for a little longerfollow-through. However, all in all, in view of the limitedamount of news, the market is doing very well.&quot;   The short covering, or the buying back of contracts thathad been sold because traders thought prices would go lower,continued strongly into Tuesday.   Figures released yesterday by the Commodity Exchangeshowed that the open interest, or the number of outstandingcontracts that remain to be nullified by opposite trades orsatisfied by the delivery of gold, continued to decline as aresult of Tuesday's trading.   The total open interest in gold declined 3,941 contractsfrom Monday to stand at 97,848. The decline in three sessionsthis week has caused open interest in gold to drop below thatof the less actively traded silver futures despite a declinein silver's open interest Tuesday. Silver's total openinterest was 98,101 contracts, down from Monday's 98,426.   Ken Gettinger, precious metals vice president for UnionBank of Switzerland, New York, said support for the marketbegan with buying of gold bullion in Europe and continuedthrough the day.   &quot;Gold has been a very active market this week,&quot; he said.&quot;The market has been reflecting the Middle East tensions, aweaker dollar and anticipation of easier interest rates.Futures have been helped by technical support after theAugust contract rose above $370. Also a contributing factorhas been the weakness in the stock market and indollar-denominated assets.&quot;   A very important factor, Mr. Gettinger said, is ashort-term shortage of gold bullion: &quot;Physical supplies inboth London and New York seem to be extremely scarce. Theresult has been higher gold interest rates and an upwardpressure on the spot price.&quot;   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          ENERGY: Crude oil futures prices closed mixed in lighttrading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Reports thatministers of the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries have already reached a consensus to prop up pricesand rein in production did little to spark buying, becausemost traders believe the market has factored in a bullishoutcome of the OPEC meeting under way in Geneva. As anexample of how &quot;headline trading&quot; on OPEC news has given wayto reality, news on Dow Jones International Petroleum Reportthat the United Arab Emirates' oil minister said he wouldaccept a daily production quota of 1.5 million barrels didn'teven budge prices. That level is far below the UAE's recentproduction. News before the opening of trading that Kuwait'soil minister had backed away from insisting on an increasedquota for the fourth quarter also had no effect. Despite theimpending OPEC accords, the market is viewed as fundamentallyweak, with U.S. crude oil inventories about 53 millionbarrels above last year's levels.                                                                                                          LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Prices for hog and pork belly futuresrallied, rebounding from last week's steep sell-off inresponse to increased retail demand for pork products. Porkbelly futures for delivery in August closed up the dailylimit of two cents a pound, aided by good out-of-storagemovement of frozen bellies, said Jerry Abbenhaus, a futuresanalyst with A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons in St. Louis. Figuresreleased after the close of Tuesday's trading showed that 5.4million pounds of frozen pork bellies were shipped toprocessors from warehouses near Chicago last week. Thatfigure was lower than the year-earlier shipment of 6,050,000pounds but was seen as buoying prices because supplies offrozen pork bellies have declined substantially over the pastyear, Mr. Abbenhaus said. August pork belly futures closed at47.12 cents a pound. Live hog futures prices also gainedground on news of relatively tight supplies. August hogfutures closed up 1.3 cents at 60.67 cents a pound.                                                                                                          COPPER: Futures prices were higher. The September contractrose 1.25 cents a pound to $1.2165. Analysts said somesupport was due to concern over whether workers at a mine inPeru would walk out in a labor dispute. One analyst said itmight be a &quot;non-event&quot; because many scheduled strikes in Perudon't actually occur. Another analyst said a major stumblingblock in the talks between the miners and the company was ademand for wages to be linked to inflation. Also, the analystsaid, the relatively large open interest in the July futurescontract, which will cease trading tomorrow, may havecontributed some firmness. He also said the rebound in thestock market yesterday may be reflecting greater confidencein the economy, which would favor increased demand forindustrial materials such as copper.</TEXT></DOC>
