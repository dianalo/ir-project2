Mr. Patrick, a 35-year-old conservative Republican, would succeed Mark Fowler, who has announced plans to resign sometime this spring. The White House is expected to announce the selection of Mr. Patrick perhaps as soon as today.    Mr. Fowler's departure opens one slot on the five-person commission. In addition, Mimi Weyforth Dawson, an FCC commissioner who had sought the chairman's slot, is expected to quit soon. Ms. Dawson wouldn't comment on her plans.    Among the candidates for the FCC are Ira Goldman, an aide to Sen. Pete Wilson, (R., Calif.), who successfully lobbied the agency to assign additional radio frequencies for police departments; Susan Wing, a communications lawyer here; Craig Smith, director of the Freedom of Expression Foundation, which was founded by Sen. Robert Packwood, (R., Ore.), and which advocates repeal of the fairness doctrine in broadcasting; and Jack Smith, former FCC general counsel who recently resigned to become deputy general counsel of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.    Jack Smith's candidacy is being orchestrated by Bradley Curl, national director of Morality in Media Inc., a New York-based conservative advocacy group. Mr. Curl has arranged two White House interviews for Mr. Smith and has enlisted Patrick Buchanan, the president's conservative communications director, to lobby for him.    But Mr. Smith, 41 years old, has few political contacts himself and has only an outside chance to win appointment. &quot;I'm a team player,&quot; Mr. Smith said. &quot;I'll do what the president wants.&quot;    As a current member of the FCC, Mr. Patrick won't need Senate confirmation to become chairman; other nominees for the agency would need Senate approval.    Mr. Patrick would take over as top communications regulator at a time of big changes in the industry. This week, the Justice Department urged a federal judge to transfer power over the former Bell telephone companies to the FCC. At the same time, the Democratic-controlled Congress promises tougher oversight of the agency's policies favoring deregulation. Mr. Patrick wouldn't comment on his plans for the agency.    &quot;Patrick is more low-key and less confrontational (than Mr. Fowler) and that will be well received on the Hill,&quot; said Rep. Don Wyden (D., Ore.).    But Mr. Patrick is expected to push for a number of policies that will lead to confrontations with Congress. The issues include deregulation of American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., increases in telephone access charges for consumers and abolition of the fairness doctrine. </TEXT></DOC>
