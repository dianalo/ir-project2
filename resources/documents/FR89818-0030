Among these are conditions which: (1) Preclude vessels inthe foreign trade of the United States from competing in the trade on thesame basis as any other vessel; (2) reserve substantial cargoes to thenational-flag or other vessels and fail to provide, on reasonable terms,for effective and equal access to such cargo by vessels in the foreigntrade of the United States; and (3) are discriminatory or unfair as betweencarriers, shippers, exporters, importers, or ports or between exportersfrom the United States and their foreign competitors, 46 CFR 585.3(a),(b) and (d).<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>On March 15, 1989 (54 FR 10,721), the Commission issued a Notice of Inquiry(``March Notice'') into laws, regulations and policies of the Governmentof Ecuador (``GOE'') affecting shipping in the United States/Ecuador trade(``Trade'') to determine whether action pursuant to Section 19 is warranted.The Commission instituted this inquiry as a result of allegations madeby Overseas Enterprises, Inc. (``OEI''), a U.S.-owned company, that ithas been unable to reestablish a liquid bulk service in the Trade due toGOE cargo reservation laws \1\<NOTE/> which require OEI to employ U.S.-flag vessels in such a service.In addition, the Commission requested information from the U.S. Departmentof State (``DOS'') about its efforts to resolve the situation through diplomaticchannels.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The particular law in question is GOE Resolution No. 012/87of March 1987, which reserves solid and liquid bulk import cargo from theUnited States to Ecuador for Ecuadorian-flag vessels belonging to Ecuadorianshipping companies, or foreign vessels chartered by Ecuadorian shippingcompanies, or vessels flying the flag of the United States. The statedrationale in Resolution No. 012/87 for narrowing the application of thecargo reservation law solely to the trade between the United States andEcuador is that 88 percent of Ecuador's imported bulk cargo originates``in the Gulf of the United States.''The Commission received comments to its March Notice from Maritima TransligraS.A. (``Transligra''), OEI, Pecten Chemicals (``Pecten''), Trans MarketingHouston, Inc. (``Trans Marketing''), Shippers for Competitive Ocean Transportation(``SCOT''), the Joint Maritime Congress (``JMC''), DOS, and the GOE.Based on the comments received, the Commission on May 18, 1989 (54 FR 21,473),issued a Notice of Further Comments (``May Notice'') to provide interestedparties an opportunity to submit additional comments on the status andoperations of OEI, as well as on shipping conditions in the U.S./Ecuadortrade. These comments were generally solicited to assist the Commissionin determining whether issuance of a countervailing rule pursuant to Section19 is warranted. The Commission particularly sought information on thestatus and operations of OEI because it was not clear from the commentsfiled whether OEI operates as a carrier, is solely an agent for non-U.S.companies which are carriers operating foreign-flag vessels, or has someother relationship to carriers operating third-flag vessels.In the May Notice, the Commission stated that GOE Resolution No. 012/87,on its face, appears to create conditions unfavorable to shipping in theTrade and, to the extent that the Resolution applies only to the U.S./Ecuadorbulk trade, leaving most other Ecuadorian bulk trades open to third-flagcarriers, it is discriminatory.\2\<NOTE/> The Commission added that this Resolution allows Ecuadorianshipping companies to charter and employ foreign-flag vessels in the Trade,whereas U.S. shipping companies may employ only U.S.-flag vessels in theTrade. Further, the Commission advised that even if, as the GOE represents,U.S. companies may employ third-flag vessels in the Trade if they operateat least one U.S.-flag vessel, troubling questions are raised as to whetherEcuadorian laws dictating the fleet mix and other registration requirementsfor U.S. or other non-Ecuadorian citizens' participation in U.S. tradecreate conditions unfavorable to shipping or are otherwise inappropriate.Additionally, the Commission noted that the exclusion of third-flag operatorsin the Trade pursuant to Resolution No. 012/87 alone may create conditionsunfavorable to shipping in the Trade and that comments received thus farindicate shipper support for OEI's allegation that GOE cargo reservationlaws create conditions unfavorable to shipping in the Trade.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Exceptions to this may be the Ecuador/Brazil-Argentinatrades wherein the GOE states in its April 7, 1989 letter to GOS that 100percent of the cargo generated by those two countries destined for Ecuadoris reserved for ``itself.''Comments in response to the May Notice were received from: OEI, Transligra,SCOT, Nedlloyd Lines (``Nedlloyd''), Council of European and Japanese NationalShipowners Association (``CENSA'') and DOS. These comments are summarizedbelow.\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ <T3>See </T3>May Notice for a summary of comments received in responseto the March Notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Comments</ITAG>A. OEIOEI states that it does not own or operate vessels. It reportedly actsas agent for owners and operators of non-U.S.-flag vessels. OEI advicesthat it markets the services of vessel owners and operators and negotiatestheir charters and other shipping arrangements. Further, OEI states thatit is affiliated with and operates as agent for O.N.E. Shipping, Ltd.,a Bermuda company that uses liquid parcel tankers in regular service betweenthe U.S. and South and Central America and the Caribbean. OEI advises thatthis service of 25 years included Ecuador until GOE laws excluded competitorsof Transligra.OEI takes the position that the facts and circumstances present in thisproceeding definitively show the existence of conditions unfavorable toshipping in the foreign trade of the United States within the meaning ofSection 19 and that, therefore, countervailing action under that Sectionis warranted. The laws and policies of the GOE are said to have causedactual harm to shipping in the U.S. commerce and to U.S. trade interests.OEI maintains that all third-flag carriers except those operated by theauthorized Ecuadorian carrier, Transligra, are prohibited from carryingU.S. exports to Ecuador; \4\<NOTE/> U.S. exporters are compelled by the GOE to deal with a onecarrier monopoly; and shipping-related services by U.S. companies suchas OEI are unemployed in the Trade. OEI asserts that GOE laws and policieshave resulted in ``above-market freight rates for U.S. exporters, absenceof cost sensitive competition, inability of U.S. exporters to make commercialselection of transportation, and U.S. exporters' potential loss of marketsto other countries' exporters not facing similar restrictions.'' Further,it believes that the threat of penalties to shippers violating GOE cargoreservation laws magnifies the actual and potential harm. Shippers unwillingto risk penalties allegedly will not venture to use a carrier other thanTransligra.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ OEI reports that it has been informed that applicationsfor authorization to serve the Trade must be submitted by a U.S. companythereby barring third-flag carrier access. OEI submits that it is ``doubly affected and harmed'' by the GOE's actions.It reports that it is unable to engage U.S.-flag vessels in the Trade dueto their unavailability,\5\<NOTE/> and that its principals who own and/or operate third-flagvessels cannot use OEI to broker shipments in the Trade because third-flagvessels not chartered by Transligra are excluded.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ OEI asserts that no U.S.-flag vessels able to carry liquidbulk cargoes serve the Trade or are available for service. One reason forlack of availability of U.S.-flag service is reportedly the vessel draftrestriction at Guayaquil. OEI maintains that, due to GOE restrictions, U.S. exporters to Ecuadorand neighboring countries necessarily suffer higher costs because theyare unable to employ a single carrier to transport cargoes to all destinations.The inability to employ a single carrier allegedly prevents exporters fromreceiving volume discounts. Further, OEI contends that carriers cannotcompete effectively if barred from the U.S.-Ecuador leg of a U.S.-WestCoast of South America service. OEI takes exception with the GOE's earlier contention that no additionalservice is needed because the Trade is not large enough to accommodateany carrier other than Transligra. Transligra allegedly has used as muchor more third-flag tonnage in the Trade as Ecuadorian-flag tonnage. OEI contends that Section 19 relief is available under the circumstancesof this case, citing past Section 19 cases, dealing with countries suchas Venezuela,\6\<NOTE/> Colombia,\7\<NOTE/> and the Philippines \8\<NOTE/> wherein the Commission issued proposed rules due to unilateralforeign government actions resulting in the apparent exercise of controlby that government over the flow of U.S. exports. OEI quotes from the Commission'sproposed rules, illustrating that in these cases the Commission soughtto protect the interests of not only U.S.-flag carriers, but third-flagcarriers and U.S. shippers. OEI maintains, therefore, that Transligra'sargument that Section 19 benefits only U.S.-flag shipping is without merit.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ <T3>Actions to Adjust or Meet Conditions Unfavorable to Shipping in theUnited States/Venezuela Trade,</T3> Docket No. 82-58, Notice of ProposedRulemaking, 47 FR 55969, 55971 (December 14, 1982).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ <T3>Actions to Adjust or Meet Conditions Unfavorable to Shipping in theUnited States/Colombia Trade,</T3> Docket No. 87-11, Notice of ProposedRulemaking, 52 FR 20119 (May 29, 1987).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ <T3>Actions to Adjust or Meet Conditions Unfavorable to Shipping in theUnited States/Republic of the Philippines Trade,</T3> Docket No. 83-45,Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 48 FR 45800, 45802-03 (October 7, 1983).Further, OEI contends that relief under Section 19 is available for parceltanker cargoes. It cites the fact that such interests were previously protectedby the Commission in FMC Docket No. 87-11, <T3>Actions to Adjust or Meet Conditions Unfavorable to Shipping in theUnited States/Colombia Trade.</T3> OEI takes the position that the interestprotected by Section 19 is ``shipping in the foreign trade,'' which includesall types of international ocean commerce. OEI maintains that the harm it has described is expected to continue sincethe GOE has not indicated that it will permit freer access. Given the harmwhich allegedly is suffered by U.S. exporters of liquid bulk commodities,U.S. enterprises like OEI, and third-flag operators, OEI urges the Commissionto find that the laws, policies and actions of the GOE produce conditionsthat the Commission has previously declared to be unfavorable to shippingunder Section 19.B. TransligraComments submitted by Transligra include an affidavit of Wil W. Nefkens,Vice President of Transligra. Transligra avers that no operator of U.S.-flagvessels has claimed that conditions unfavorable to shipping exist in theTrade. Transligra states that, on the contrary, the JMC, a research andeducation organization representing U.S.-flag ship companies, did not opposeGOE policies in its comments. Transligra notes that OEI appears to be an agent for one or more third-flagcarriers and argues that FMC jurisdiction under Section 19 is limited toprotecting the interests of U.S.-flag carriers. Transligra submits a number of statements rebutting comments filed byshippers in response to the Commission's March Notice. It states that TransMarketing neither claims nor demonstrates that service in the Trade ispoor, rates are high, or unfavorable conditions exist. Transligra assertsthat Pecten makes no attempt to support its allegations of high rates inthe Trade. It likewise counters SCOT's concern that GOE restrictions donot apply to liquid bulk exporters of any other country, contending thatvirtually all liquid bulk parcel tanker imports to Ecuador are shippedfrom the U.S. SCOT's allegations that GOE restrictions result in economic,safety and environmental costs are said to be unfounded and in no way demonstratethat conditions are unfavorable to shipping in the trade from the U.S.to Ecuador. Transligra responds that its rates in the Trade are competitiveand its service is efficient and of high quality.Further, Transligra maintains that OEI's claim that the number of liquidbulk operators offering service from the U.S. to Ecuador has declined toone while the Ecuadorian import trade from other countries continues tohave several operators is misleading. It notes that OEI, for example, listsproduct carriers such as Shell Tankers as carriers of Ecuadorian liquidbulk imports in other trades. Further, Transligra advises that less than10 percent of parcel shipments in any year originates outside the U.S.Transligra concludes that nothing in the comments submitted to date indicatesthat unfavorable conditions exist in the Trade, and accordingly suggeststhat the proceeding be terminated. The affidavit submitted by Mr. Nefkens provides information on Transligra'sservice in the Trade, stating that its rates are competitive and operationsefficient. He reports that Transligra operates one Ecuadorian-flag vessel,the MV CHIMBORAZO which normally makes 10 to 11 voyages per year in theTrade. When additional tonnage is required, Transligra reportedly chartersspace on other parcel tankers or charters entire voyages. Mr. Nefkens takes exception to a number of comments submitted in responseto the Commission's March Notice. He points out that OEI's claim that noU.S.-flag vessels are available for service in the Trade is directly refutedby the JMC. He suggests, however, that if OEI is a U.S. company operatingvessels, it would acquire a foreign-built vessel and register it underthe U.S. flag. Mr. Nefkens also takes issue with OEI's statement that Transligra transportsa majority of its liquid bulk cargo on third-flag vessels. He states thatin the first five months of 1989, over one-half of Transligra's liquidbulk cargoes were transported on Ecuadorian-flag vessels. Mr. Nefkens explainsthat, if sufficient liquid bulk cargoes were available in the Trade, Transligrawould operate a second Ecuadorian-flag vessel. Mr. Nefkens states that the GOE ``obviously favors reliable service bythe Ecuadorian carrier, operating a dedicated Ecuadorian vessel'' at ratesthat can be adjusted or lowered by the GOE when it believes that such actionis necessary. Further, Mr. Nefkens submits that Transligra can offer afull service which meets the needs of shippers. C. SCOT SCOT reports that its members have used OEI vessels in U.S./South Americatrades other than the U.S./Ecuador trade, and that it has provided efficientservice. It therefore maintains that OEI should not be denied access tothe Trade. SCOT explains that in small markets for U.S. exports, such as Ecuador,it is particularly important that chemical parcel tankers be free to servea total geographic area to make their services cost effective. Free accessis said to be important so that shippers can select the carrier that willbest assure safe handling of the product, minimize the risk to the environment,and maintain product quality. SCOT asserts that these assurances are notpossible when a single carrier, <T3>i.e.</T3>, Transligra, is granted an effective monopoly in the Trade.SCOT refutes JMC's claim that the U.S. merchant marine has chemical parceltankers capable of operating in the Trade. Further, SCOT disputes JMC'sargument that the FMC's primary goal is to protect the rights of U.S.-flagvessels, asserting that the FMC is responsible for protecting the rightsof U.S. shippers, as well as the rights of U.S.-flag and other carriers.SCOT expresses concern over the fact that the GOE has involved itself inthe setting of freight rates, which it believes should be set by the marketand not by the government. Additionally, SCOT is troubled by the fact thatthe GOE has imposed severe fines on importers who violated the cargo reservationlaw. SCOT has provided information on conditions in the U.S./Ecuador <T3>liner</T3> trade because GOE cargo reservation policies extend to liner,as well as bulk cargoes. Competition in the U.S./Ecuador liner trade issaid to be extremely limited causing rates to be among the highest thatU.S. shippers experience anywhere in the world. SCOT states that with thepossible exception of northbound service by Nedlloyd to the U.S. East Coast,no third-flag carriers operate in the Trade. D. Nedlloyd Nedlloyd advises that it is precluded from offering service in the U.S.export trade to Ecuador because of Ecuadorian requirements that U.S. exportsto Ecuador be transported on Ecuadorian or U.S.-flag vessels. It believesthat ``the overall effect of Ecuadorian restrictions on U.S. martime commerceis to restrict heavily market mechanisms in the export commerce of theUnited States to Ecuador without subjecting Ecuadorian exports to similarimpediments.'' Nedlloyd urges the Commission to examine Ecuador's restrictionsof general cargo as part of its evaluation of OEI's complaint. While Nedlloyd has no information to submit regarding the status of OEI,it challenges the position taken by Transligra that OEI lacks standingto raise issues under Section 19. Nedlloyd states that this position isinconsistent with the provision's nearly seventy-year history. Nedlloydsubmits that Commission authority under Section 19 and the issues to bebrought to the Commission pursuant thereto must necessarily be broad. Itcontends that the adverse impact of unilateral restrictions on U.S. commerceis varied and widespread. In order for the Commission to determine whetherunfavorable conditions exist, Nedlloyd believes that the Commission mustengage in efforts to obtain the broadest possible comment in the shortesttime practicable. Nedlloyd maintains that Transligra, through its Petitionto Dismiss the Proceeding due to OEI's standing, is attempting to preventthe Commission from compiling an adequate record, and is focusing on OEI'sstatus rather than explaining why Transligra should enjoy a privilegedposition in the U.S. export commerce due to GOE restrictions, or providinga defense or explanation for GOE restrictions. E. CENSA CENSA challenges Transligra's argument that Section 19 does not extendto protection of non-U.S.-flag carriers. CENSA notes that the Commissionhas consistently rejected this argument and that the Commission's long-standinginterpretation of Section 19 has not been overridden by Congress. CENSA,therefore, urges the Commission to adhere to its prior decisions and rejectthe jurisdictional argument advanced by Transligra. F. DOS The DOS transmitted two letters to the Commission. By letter of June 6,1989, DOS reports that the issue of OEI was being discussed within theGOE's National Merchant Marine Council. In a follow up letter to the Commission,dated July 21, 1989, DOS advises that based on a recent meeting betweenU.S. Embassy representatives in Quito and GOE officials, the GOE has notindicated that it is contemplating any initiatives to allow OEI into theTrade. <ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion </ITAG>A. Jurisdiction Much of the substance of the second round of comments was directed to thelegal issue raised by Transligra, that the reach of Section 19 is limitedto U.S.-flag vessel operators and thus may not be invoked by OEI, which,although a U.S. company, is not an operator of vessels. Indeed, certaincommenters went to some length to refute the jurisdictional contentionsof Transligra. CENSA filed comments addressed solely to this issue, citingpast Commission exercises and interpretations of Section 19. Nedlloyd Linesfiled lengthy comments rejecting what it terms Transligra's ``torturedinterpretations of Section 19 * * *.'' (Nedlloyd Comments at 1.)Nedlloyd correctly points out that Transligra's reliance on specific aspectsof the legislative history is strained and misplaced. Transligra arguesthat the 1920 Act is promotional in purpose rather than regulatory, andthat regulation of carriers was accomplished in the earlier Shipping Act,1916 (``1916 Act''), 46 U.S.C. 801, et seq. (1982). In this connection,Transligra states that the ``only'' regulatory section of the 1920 Act_Section20_was cast as an amendment to the 1916 Act. This argument ignores thefact that Section 19 itself refers to regulations affecting shipping ineach of its four subsections. Moreover, as Nedlloyd points out, the farmore numerous promotional aspects of the 1920 Act were specifically recognizedas such and separated from the regulatory section_Section 19_when the MaritimeAdministration was created as an agency separate from the Federal MaritimeCommission in 1961.Transligra's use of the legislative history of the Merchant Marine Act,1920 is disingenuous and misleading in several respects. In its Petitionto Dismiss this proceeding,\9\<NOTE/> Transligra cites from the House hearings and debates, arguingthat they focus exclusively on the maintenance of a U.S.-flag merchantmarine based on the government-built ships to be transferred to the privatesector at the end of World War I. (<T3>See </T3>Transligra Petition to Dismiss the Proceedings, 7-8.) However,Section 19 was not part of the bill that originated in the House of Representatives.Section 19, therefore, did not exist during the House hearings and debatesand the concerns expressed there cannot accurately be relied upon in interpretingthe scope of that section. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ Transligra's Petition to Dismiss the Proceedings has beentreated by the Commission as comments. See the Commission's May Notice(54 FR 21473).Moreover, even with respect to the House debates, Transligra overstatesthe exclusivity of the legislative concern with the welfare of a U.S.-flagfleet. In the House debate on the original bill, H.R. 10378, which focusedsolely on disposition of the World War I fleet acquired by the United StatesShipping Board and the Emergency Fleet Corporation, the concern was ``[n]otonly that we must have our own merchant marine if we <T3>expect our commerce to have a fair chance in the markets of the world</T3>in peace time, but it is necessary that we do so in case of emergency.''58 Cong. Rec. 8152 (1919) (Emphasis added). For example, RepresentativeLazaro expressed the concern that:<ITAG tagnum="21">Other powerful nations have built and are building their merchantmarines and we must do likewise <T3>if we are to get our share of the world's commerce. </T3>The day hascome when we should be no more dependent upon foreign ships to carry ourproducts to market than should any other nation. We all agree that we areto have intensive competition following the world war and that we needa sound policy and sane laws to keep up our position. (Emphasis added)<T3>Id.</T3></ITAG>This concern was echoed by Representative Wright:<ITAG tagnum="21">As I see it, the brightest opportunity in the history of this greatcountry is before us, to promote an efficient and great American merchantmarine, and <T3>thereby to extend and promote our foreign commerce and trade. </T3>(Emphasisadded). <T3>Id.</T3></ITAG>Thus, even the House debates reflect the broader Congressional concernwith U.S. trade and commerce generally, as well as vessel operations. Thesegeneral concerns informed the impetus for the bill originated in the Houseas H.R. 10378 which dealt only with the disposition of the ships and otherphysical assets acquired by the United States Shipping Board, as well asits maritime powers. This bill did not extend to other concerns, includingthe detrimental actions of foreign governments and foreign carriers, whichsubsequently arose during Senate consideration of the bill.Indeed, Section 19 originated in the draft of the bill that emerged fromthe Senate Committee on Commerce following testimony concerning the detrimentaleffects of foreign laws and regulations on the ability of U.S. commercialinterests to compete in foreign markets. The Senate committee heard muchtestimony on the effects of foreign laws, rules, ``orders in council'',and shipping and commercial practices in promoting not only the foreignnation's merchant marines, but their import and export trade as well, tothe detriment of American commercial interests.The British and Canadian use of orders in council was discussed in thetestimony of William L. Clark of the Pacific Steamship Company. <T3>Hearings Before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Establishment ofan American Merchant Marine, </T3>66th Cong., 2nd Sess. 1429, 1453-1456,1463-1466 (1920). The following exchange occurred during that testimony:<ITAG tagnum="21">SEN.

[Emphasis supplied]</ITAG>Section 19 originated in the Confidential Committee Print of H.R. 10378which emerged from those hearings. The language proposed in that printwas enacted with little change.\10\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\A direction to act ``in aid of the development and maintenanceof an American merchant marine'' was replaced by the more general commandto ``* * * aid in the accomplishment of the purposes of this Act * * *''and the reference to rules and regulations ``relating to ships and shipping''was replaced with a reference to ``shipping'' only.These broad, nationalistic purposes of the Act were emphasized in floordebate on the Senate bill by Senator Jones, Chairman of the Commerce Committee,who expressed the desire:<ITAG tagnum="20">to impress upon the Shipping Board, if I can do it * * * that we wantthem to be animated by a spirit of Americanism; that we want them to bemoved with the desire, an intense desire, </ITAG><T3>to build up American trade, American shipping, and American interests.</T3>I want them to understand that we are placing in their hands the greatestand widest power, probably greater than was ever invested in any governmentalorganization before and that we are giving them this power and giving themthis discretion <T3>to use in the interest of American trade and American shipping</T3>and not for the purpose of simply getting rid of the ships we have in themost expeditious way possible. 59 Cong. Rec. 6813 (May 10, 1920). [Emphasisadded]This portion of the Senate debate is also quoted at page 5 of Transligra'sPetition to Dismiss. We note, however, that the passage has been selectivelyedited by Transligra to omit the references to ``American trade'' or thebroader ``American interests'' of concern to Senator Jones. Therefore,contrary to Transligra's representations, the legislative history of Section19 does reflect Congress' wish to protect not only U.S.-flag carriers,but U.S. interests in the efficient movement of U.S. export and importcommerce.The Commission sought clarification and further comment on the nature ofOEI's operations in its May Notice. OEI advises in its supplemental commentsthat it does not itself operate vessels, but arranges and coordinates shippingtransactions between vessel owners and operations and U.S. exporters.We do not view OEI's activities as making it any less engaged in the businessof ``shipping in the foreign trade,'' as that term is used in Section 19.It participates in such ``shipping'' much in the same way as non-vesseloperating common carriers (NVOCCs) and ocean freight forwarders do.Although the Commission's rules do not refer to such participants in maritimeactivities in delineating who may file a petition for relief under Section19 at 46 CFR 585.4, the rule is applicable to <T3>``any person,</T3> including, but not limited to * * *'' the entitiesnamed. (Emphasis added). We see no reason to exclude non-carrier maritimebusinesses, such as OEI, from the broad coverage available under Section19.The Commission's rule, moreover, clearly states its applicability to anyowner, operator or charterer of ``bulk or tramp,'' as well as liner, vessels.OEI, as a U.S. company seeking to participate in transactions to providebulk vessel capacity in the Trade for service to U.S. exporters is withinthe range of shipping interests protected by Section 19. The Commissionproposed a rule to meet conditions alleged to be unfavorable to shippingin the liquid bulk trade between the U.S. and Columbia. <T3>See Actions to Adjust or Meet Conditions Unfavorable to Shipping inthe United States/Colombia Trade,</T3> 52 FR 20,119 (May 29, 1987).B. Conditions Unfavorable to ShippingThe supplemental comments filed in response to the Commission's May Notice,taken as a whole, support the tentative conclusion of that Notice that``GOE Resolution No. 012/87, on its face, appears to create conditionsunfavorable to shipping in the Trade.'' Nothing in the second round ofcomments justifies or offsets the discriminatory nature of the Resolutionnoted therein.The discriminatory impact of the Ecuadorian Resolution is not lessenedby the possible authorization of service by a U.S. company operating atleast one U.S. vessel. No U.S.-flag vessels can or do serve the Trade,according to OEI, due to economic and physical impediments to such service.The physical limitations of the port of Guayaquil make service by a vesselof greater than 23andmin16;6andmin16;andmin16; draft impossible; U.S.-flag chemicaltankers reportedly exceed that draft. Economic as well as physical aspectsof the Trade effectively limit service to parcel tankers of 5 to 10 thousandDWT. No such vessels are present in the U.S.-flag fleet, according to OEI.In any event, the possible existence of U.S.-flag vessels which might beable to participate in this Trade does not justify GOE exclusion from theTrade of other vessels which do wish to participate, in order to createa monopoly for its own vessels.As OEI points out in its supplemental comments, the effect of the Ecuadorianresolution is to close the Trade to all third-flag carriers <T3>except </T3>those chosen by Transligra to participate through charters.The result, as several commenters point out, is to subject U.S. exportcommerce to a limit imposed on the market for shipping services by theGOE while similar limits are not imposed on the shipping services availableto Ecuadorian exporters or non-U.S. exporters to Ecuador.The comments of SCOT and Pecten indicate that those who must move cargoin this U.S. export trade find that their ability to do so efficientlyand safely, as well as economically, has been adversely affected by theexclusion of third-flag carriers from the market. Such effects are harmfulto shipping in the Trade within the meaning of section 19.The only justification for the GOE restrictions offered by Transligra isthat the size of the Trade provides only sufficient cargo for its own dedicatedservice. The Commission has rejected similar arguments based on adequacyof service in the past, and does so again here. As we noted in Docket No.86-7 concerning Peru, adequacy of service ``is irrelevant as a defenseof government schemes which limit competition in shipping services in orderto protect or enhance their national-flag or State-owned shipping lines.''<T3>See Actions to Adjust or Meet Conditions Unfavorable to Shipping inthe United States/Peru Trade, </T3>Order Denying Petition, <T2>XXX</T2> F.M.C. <T2>XXX</T2>, 24 S.R.R. 308, 312 (June 18, 1987). The Commission therefurther pointed out that a showing that the government-favored carriernow offers adequate service may merely indicate that it has been able toincrease its share of the market and consolidate its position during theperiod when competitors have been excluded.The Commission, therefore, finds that conditions unfavorable to shippingappear to exist in this Trade.C. SanctionsTransligra is the chief, if not sole, beneficiary of the Ecuadorian resolution.Transligra is an Ecuadorian-flag carrier serving the Trade with one Ecuadorian-flagvessel and additional space chartered on foreign-flag vessels. However,Transligra is not a liner operator and therefore does not file tariffs.Therefore, tariff cancellation is not an available sanction. The sanctionsadded to section 19 by the Foreign Shipping Practices Act of 1988, 46 U.S.C.app. 1710a, however, are available. These include the assessment of a feeof up to $1 million per voyage, as well as the denial of clearance at U.S.ports by the collector of customs.Based on the comments filed to date, the Commission has found that conditionsunfavorable to shipping appear to exist in the U.S./Ecuador trade as aresult of Ecuadorian Resolution No. 012/87. In order to adjust or meetthese conditions, we herein propose a rule to impose a countervailing feeof $100,000 per outbound (ex. U.S.) voyage by Transligra. In addition,in order to secure the information necessary for Commission administrationand enforcement of this rule, Transligra is required to file with the Commissionperiodic reports reflecting the service it provides in the Trade, includingthe vessels employed and the amount of cargo carried, as well as certificationthat it has complied with the Commission's rule. In the event that Transligrafails to comply with the requirements of the rule, it is further providedthat the Commission, through its Secretary, will request that the collectorof customs at ports in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico deny the clearance requiredby section 4197 of the Revised Statutes (46 U.S.C. app. 91) to vesselsowned or operated by Transligra, as provided for in section 1002(f) ofthe Foreign Shipping Practices Act of 1988, 46 U.S.C. app. 1710a(f).Since the Commission instituted this proceeding by publication of the Noticeof Inquiry in March 1989, there has been no indication of willingness onthe part of the GOE to permit greater opportunity for non-Ecuadorian participationin the Trade. Nevertheless, it is to be hoped that progress in resolvingthese issues, through GOE acton or talks with OEI or the DOS, or both,may yet be achieved without need for Commission action on a Final Rulein this proceeding.To assist the Commission in assessing the continuing need for the actionproposed, interested parties are invited to file comments, views and informationrelating to the proposed rule within 30 days of publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Because the Commission is proposing a rule tomeet or adjust conditions in a non-liner trade by action affecting a carrierwhich does not file tariffs with the Commission, the specific authorityprovided in the Foreign Shipping Practices Act of 1988, making the actionagainst foreign carriers authorized by that Act available for use in proceedingsunder section 19, has been utilized. This is, therefore, a case of firstimpression in that respect, and interested parties are asked to focus intheir comments on the sanctions proposed. The issues raised include theprobable effect of the fees imposed on Transligra's rates in the Tradeand the possibility that the request for denial of clearance, reflectedat section 586.3(d) of the proposed rule, alone might be a more effectivemeans of adjusting the effects of GOE Resolution No. 012/87.Another matter to which commenter's attention is invited is the possibilitythat the Commission might require in its final rule that the fees imposedwill become effective if the Ecuadorian-flag carrier fails to certify within25 days of publication that no law, regulation or policy of the GOE willpreclude any carrier from operating in the trade on the same basis as anyother carrier or impose any administrative burden on any non-Ecuadorian-flagcarrier, vessel or shipper in the trade not imposed on Ecuadorian-flagcarriers.In addition to the rule proposed herein to meet or adjust conditions unfavorableto shipping in the U.S./Ecuador trade, the Commission proposes to revisethe manner in which it incorporates in the Code of Federal Regulationsrules issued in similar proceedings under section 19. Therefore, the Commissionproposes to revise part 586 of the CFR to add a new andSection; 586.1 descriptiveof the function of part 586 and to redesignate and incorporate as a singleandSection; 586.2 all provisions of the current part 586 which were enactedby the Final Rule to adjust or meet conditions unfavorable to shippingin the U.S./Peru Trade, published at 54 FR 12629 (March 28, 1989). Thisrule is republished herein to reflect the redesignation and conformingchanges. No substantive changes have been made in the rule and its statusas a Final Rule is unchanged by this action.
