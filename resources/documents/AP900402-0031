(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Planners of Peoria's tricentennialcelebration are going shopping across the river for a littlehistory.   The group, the Peoria 1691 Foundation, has proposed buying fourold houses in Missouri and moving them to Illinois to reconstruct aFrench colony of the banks of the Illinois River just like thesettlement that evolved into Peoria.   The original village in what is now downtown Peoria wasdestroyed by fire in 1812, so civic leaders have set their sightson the French colonial houses built in the late 18th and early 19thcenturies in Ste. Genevieve, Mo.   But what might play in Peoria doesn't play well in Ste.Genevieve.   ``This is just like the rape of antiquities in the colonialdays,'' said Melburn Thurman, a Ste. Genevieve anthropologist.``This is a totally unethical and reprehensible action by the cityof Peoria. They are trying to steal our great prize, our historicjewel.''   But Dorothy Sinclair, administrative director of the PeoriaHistorical Society, views the action as one of historicpreservation.   ``We came along and expressed an interest in them after learningthey were being sold and threatened with possible destruction,''Mrs. Sinclair said.   ``We did not go down there in the night and carry them away. Wethink it's better they be saved and preserved in Peoria than beingtorn down in Ste. Genevieve.''   Ste. Genevieve, a town of 5,000 situated 75 miles south of St.Louis, was once part of France's Louisiana Territory, bought by theUnited States in 1803.   The historical society estimates it would cost $500,000 to buyand relocate the houses. The non-profit group would raise the moneythrough donations and doesn't need Peoria officials' approval.   Ste. Genevieve city commissioners could block the plan since thehouses are on the National Registry of Historic Places, but theyhave taken no action so far. The Peoria group has yet to sign anagreement to buy the houses.   Royce and Margaret Wilhauk, who own three of the houses, saidthey contacted the state of Missouri after officials in Peoria madean offer last fall.   ``We have given the state an option on the houses and they'veasked for an extension,'' Mrs. Wilhauk said. ``We'd like the housesto stay here. But if we can't work something out, we will considerthe Peoria offer.''   Frank Myers of Ste. Genevieve's Foundation for Preservation saysthe houses should stay. ``We'd like to share our knowledge withPeoria, but we don't necessarily want to share our buildings withPeoria,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
