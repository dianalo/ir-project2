Downey,partner with Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. and a former member of theMunicipal Securities Rulemaking Board.   Downey, 53, was named to succeed Hardwick Simmons as 1990chairman of the trade group, which represents more than 625securities brokerages and investment banking firms in the UnitedStates and Canada.   The SIA board will vote on the nomination at its annual meetingon Nov. 29 in Florida.   In recent days, several major Wall Street brokerages have saidthey will curb program trading that critics claim is dangerouslydistorting the stock market and scaring away small investors.   In program trading, millions of shares of stocks are tradedalmost instantaneously by computerized systems used mainly by hugeinstitutional investors such as banks, mutual funds and pensionfunds.   ``Our policy has to be to address'' controversial strategies,Downey said.   However, he said many of the problems facing the industry havebeen overstated.   ``We've had these outside factors and we have insider tradingscandals and things of that nature that maybe involve just a fewpeople, but they are magnified and thought to be pervasive, butthey're not,'' Downey said.   Also nominated to the SIA board were John L. Steffens, presidentand chief executive of of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner andamp; SmithInc., as vice chairman; Richard B. Fisher, president of MorganStanley Group Inc. and Addison L. Piper, chairman fo chiefexecutive of Piper, Jaffray andamp; Hopwood, both renominated as vicechairmen.
