Background </ITAG>Pursuant to Public Law (P.L.) 97-415, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission(the Commission) is publishing this regular biweekly notice. P.L. 97-415revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act),to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, orproposed to be issued, under a new provision of section 189 of the Act.This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediatelyeffective any amendment to an operating license upon a determination bythe Commission that such amendment involves no significant hazards consideration,notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearingfrom any person. This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposedto be issued from January 16, 1989 through January 27, 1989. The last biweeklynotice was published on February 1, 1989 (54 FR 5159). <ITAG tagnum="84">NOTICE OF CONSIDERATION OF ISSUANCE OF AMENDMENT TO FACILITY OPERATINGLICENSE AND PROPOSED NO SIGNIFICANT HAZARDS CONSIDERATION DETERMINATIONAND OPPORTUNITY FOR HEARING </ITAG>The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendmentrequests involve no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission'sregulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facilityin accordance with the proposed amendments would not (1) involve a significantincrease in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated;or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination for eachamendment request is shown below. The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination.Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of thisnotice will be considered in making any final determination. The Commissionwill not normally make a final determination unless it receives a requestfor a hearing. Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Regulatory PublicationsBranch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Officeof Administration and Resources Management, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, and should cite the publication date and page numberof this <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. Written comments may also be deliveredto Room P-216, Phillips Building, 7920 Norfolk Avenue, Bethesda, Marylandfrom 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Copies of written comments received may beexamined at the NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,NW., Washington, DC. The filing of requests for hearing and petitions forleave to intervene is discussed below. By March 10, 1989 the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respectto issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operating licenseand any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and whowishes to participate as a party in the proceeding must file a writtenpetition for leave to intervene. Requests for a hearing and petitions forleave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rulesof Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. If arequest for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by theabove date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designatedby the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and LicensingBoard Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition and the Secretaryor the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a noticeof hearing or an appropriate order. As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall setforth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding,and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding.The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention shouldbe permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) thenature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to theproceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial,or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of anyorder which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest.The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subjectmatter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Anyperson who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has beenadmitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave ofthe Board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfythe specificity requirements described above. Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to thepetition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions whichare sought to be litigated in the matter, and the bases for each contentionset forth with reasonable specificity. Contentions shall be limited tomatters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. A petitionerwho fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirementswith respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participateas a party. Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subjectto any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have theopportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, includingthe opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determinationon the issue of no significant hazards consideration. The final determinationwill serve to decide when the hearing is held. If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significanthazards consideration, the Commission may issue the amendment and makeit immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Anyhearing held would take place after issuance of the amendment. If the final determination is that the amendment involves a significanthazards consideration, any hearing held would take place before the issuanceof any amendment. Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expirationof the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances change duringthe notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result,for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission mayissue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day noticeperiod, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involvesno significant hazards consideration. The final determination will considerall public and State comments received before action is taken. Should theCommission take this action, it will publish a notice of issuance and providefor opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects thatthe need to take this action will occur very infrequently. A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filedwith the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Service Branch, or may bedelivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building,2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC, by the above date. Where petitionsare filed during the last ten (10) days of the notice period, it is requestedthat the petitioner promptly so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephonecall to Western Union at 1-(800) 325-6000 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number3737 and the following message addressed to (<T3>Project Director</T3>): petitioner's name and telephone number; datepetition was mailed; plant name; and publication date and page number ofthis <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. A copy of the petition should also besent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions,supplemental petitions and/or requests for hearing will not be entertainedabsent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or thepresiding Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, that the petition and/or requestshould be granted based upon a balancing of factors specified in 10 CFR2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d). For further details with respect to this action, see the application foramendment which is available for public inspection at the Commission'sPublic Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,DC, and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved.<ITAG tagnum="84">Arkansas Power andamp; Light Company, Docket No. 50-313, Arkansas NuclearOne, Unit 1, Pope County, Arkansas </ITAG><T3>Date of amendment request: </T3>June 30, 1988 <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>The proposed amendment wouldmodify the Technical Specifications by adding surveillance requirementsfor the automatic actuation of the shunt trip attachments of the reactortrip breakers, and for the silicon controlled rectifier (SCR) trip relaysused to interrupt power to the control rods, as required by Items 4.3 and4.4 of Generic Letter 83-28, ``Required Actions Based On Generic Implicationsof Salem Anticipated Transient Without Scram Events,'' and Generic Letter(GL) 85-10, ``Technical Specifications For GL 83-28, Items 4.3 and 4.4.''This Notice supersedes the Notice published September 21, 1988 (53 FR 36668).<T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>As stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c), a proposed amendment to an operatinglicense involves no significant hazards consideration, if operation ofthe facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not: (1) Involvea significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accidentpreviously evaluated; or (2) Create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) Involvea significant reduction in a margin of safety. The Commission has provided guidance for the application of the above criteriafor no significant hazards consideration determination by providing examplesof amendments that are considered not likely to involve significant hazardsconsiderations (51 FR 7751). These examples include: Example (ii) A changethat constitutes an additional limitation, restriction, or control notpresently included in the Technical Specifications: e.g., ``a more stringentsurveillance requirement.'' The proposed addition of surveillance test requirements and limiting conditionsfor operation for the RTB shunt trip attachments and the SCR trip relaysare additional limitations not presently included in the Technical Specifications,and are therefore within the scope of the example. Since the application for amendment involves a proposed change that isencompassed by an example for which no significant hazards considerationexists, the staff has made a proposed determination that the applicationinvolves no significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Tomlinson Library, ArkansasTech University, Russellville, Arkansas 72801 <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Nicholas S. Reynolds, Esq., Bishop, Cook,Purcell, andamp; Reynolds, 1400 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20005-3502<T3>NRC Project Director: </T3>Jose A. Calvo <ITAG tagnum="84">Arkansas Power andamp; Light Company, Docket No. 50-313 and 50-368,Arkansas Nuclear One, Units 1 and 2, Pope County, Arkansas </ITAG><T3>Date of amendment request: </T3>October 30, 1987 <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>The proposed amendment wouldchange the expiration date for Unit 1 Facility Operating License No. DPR-51from December 6, 2008 to May 20, 2014 and would change the expiration datefor Unit 2 Facility Operating License No. NPF-6, from December 6, 2012to July 17, 2018. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards in 10 CFR 50.92(c) for determiningwhether a significant hazards consideration exists. A proposed amendmentto an Operating License for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated, (2) create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated,or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The ArkansasPower and Light Company reviewed the proposed change and determined forUnit 1 and Unit 2 that: (1) The proposed change does not involve any changes in plant design, physicalchanges to plant systems, equipment or structures, or modifications toTechnical Specifications or plant procedures. The original plant designprovides for 40 years of operation and postulated accidents have been evaluatedaccordingly. Surveillance, inspection, testing, and maintenance programsare in place to sustain the condition of the plant throughout its servicelife. In conclusion, the potential effects of 40 years of operation havebeen considered in the existing design, analyses and operation of the plantand, therefore, the probability or consequences of previously evaluatedaccidents has not been significantly increased. (2) Since the proposed change does not affect the design or operation ofthe plant and programs are in place to maintain the plant throughout itsservice life, the change does not increase the possibility of a new ordifferent accident from those previously evaluated. (3) The proposed change does not involve any changes in plant design, physicalchanges to plant systems, equipment or structures, or modifications toTechnical Specifications or plant procedures. Existing surveillance, inspection,testing, and maintenance programs sustain the condition of the plant throughoutits service life. These measures, together with continued operation inaccordance with the Technical Specifications assure that an adequate marginof safety is preserved on a continuous basis. Therefore, the extensionof the operating license term does not result in a significant reductionin a margin of safety. Based on the previous discussion, the licensee concluded that the proposedamendment request does not involve a significant increase in the probabilityof a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;nor involve a significant reduction in the required margin of safety. TheNRC staff has reviewed the licensee's no significant hazards considerationsdetermination and agrees with the licensee's analysis. The staff has, therefore,made a proposed determination that the licensee's request does not involvea significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Tomlinson Library, ArkansasTech University, Russellville, Arkansas 72801 <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Nicholas S. Reynolds, Esq., Bishop, Cook,Purcell, andamp; Reynolds, 1400 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20005-3502<T3>NRC Project Director: </T3>Jose A. Calvo <ITAG tagnum="84">Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company, Docket No. 50-213, HaddamNeck Plant, Middlesex County, Connecticut and Northeast Nuclear EnergyCompany, et al., Docket Nos. 50-245/336/423, Millstone Nuclear Power Station,Unit Nos. 1, 2 and 3, New London County, Connecticut </ITAG><T3>Date of amendment request: </T3>January 12, 1989 <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>The proposed amendments to theTechnical Specifications (TS) will add a new requirement to TS Section6.7, ``Safety Limit Violation.'' This requirement will state that ``operationshall not be resumed until authorized by the Commission.'' This proposedchange will make the TS for the four plants consistent with the requirementsof 10 CFR 50.36. In addition a change to the Millstone Unit 3 TS has been proposed to changethe requirement for auditing TS compliance from all provisions in eachsection to provision in each section, each year, during the five-year auditcycle for this plant. This change will make the Millstone Unit 3 TS consistentwith the TS for the other three plants. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The licensees have reviewed the proposed changes in accordance with10 CFR 50.92 and have concluded and the staff agrees that they do not involvea significant hazards consideration in that these changes would not: 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability of occurrence or consequencesof an accident previously analyzed. The proposed changes will make thetechnical specifications consistent with 10 CFR 50.36 for Safety LimitViolations. In addition, the change proposed in the area of Nuclear ReviewBoard Audits will make Millstone Unit 3 consistent with the WestinghouseStandard TS and other Nuclear Plant's Technical Specifications. These changeswill not increase the probability of occurrence or the consequences ofan accident previously analyzed. 2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from anypreviously analyzed. Since there are no changes in the way the plant isoperated, the potential for an unanalyzed accident is not created. No newfailure modes are introduced. 3. Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. Since the proposedchanges do not affect the consequences of any accident previously analyzed,there is no reduction in the margin of safety. Based on the above, the staff proposes to determine that the proposed changesdo not involve a significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Russell Library, 123 BroadStreet, Middletown, Connecticut 06457 and the Waterford Public Library,49 Rope Ferry Road, Waterford, Connecticut 06385. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Gerald Garfield, Esquire, Day, Berry andamp;Howard, Counselors at Law, City Place, Hartford, Connecticut 06103-3499.<T3>NRC Project Director: </T3>John F. Stolz <ITAG tagnum="84">Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Docket No. 50-247, IndianPoint Nuclear Generating Unit No. 2, Westchester County, New York </ITAG><T3>Date of amendment request: </T3>September 30, 1988 as supplementedDecember 30, 1988 and revised January 20, 1989. <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>The amendment would revise theIndian Point 2 Technical Specifications to allow a fuel design transitionto Westinghouse 15X15 Optimized Fuel Assemblies (OFA) fuel. Indian Point2 has been operating with a Westinghouse 15X15 low-parasitic (LOPAR) fueledcore. The 15X15 OFA fuel has design features similar to the 15X15 LOPARfuel. The major design difference is the use of seven middle zircoloy gridsfor the OFA fuel versus seven middle inconel grids for the LOPAR fuel.Several of the plant operating limitations contained in the Technical Specificationswill require revisions to allow the use of the OFA fuel and are discussedbelow. 1. <T3>Administrative Changes </T3>- References to LOPAR fuel throughout theTechnical Specifications will be revised. In addition, the licensee isusing this amendment application to delete obsolete requirements, relocaterequirements to other sections of the Technical Specifications and maketypographical corrections and clarifications. 2. <T3>Improved Thermal Design Procedure and WRB-1 Correlation </T3>- Theproposed changes to Technical Specification Figure 2.1-1 would includea change to the thermal hydraulic design method used to satisfy the Departurefrom Nucleate Boiling design bases for Indian Point 2. 3. <T3>Low Pressurizer Pressure Reactor Trip Setpoint </T3>- The proposedchanges to Technical Specification 2.3.1.B(3) would increase the minimumallowable value for the low pressurizer pressure reactor trip set pointfrom greater than or equal to 1700 psig to greater than 1870 psig. Thechange is being proposed to revise the allowable setpoint trip to a valuemore consistent with plant operation. 4. <T3>Over Temperature delta T and Over Power delta T Setpoints </T3>- Theproposed amendment would change Technical Specifications 2.3.1.B(4), 2.3.1.B(5)and Figure 2.1-1 concerning Overtemperature delta T and Overpower deltaT. The revision to Figure 2.1-1 results from the implementation of a changein the Westinghouse DNB methodology as discussed in 2 above and a changein the allowable F delta H discussed in 8 below. The changes to 2.3.1.B(4)and 2.3.1.B(5) reflect the revised reactor core safety limits given inthe proposed Figure 2.1-1. 5. <T3>Boric Acid Storage System Volume </T3>- The proposed revision to Section3.2 changes the minimum volume requirements of the Boric Acid Storage Systemfrom 4400 to 6000 gallons. The revision is proposed to provide additionalfuel management flexibility. 6. <T3>Safety Injection Accumulators - </T3>The proposed revision to Specification3.3.A.1.C changes the Safety Injection Accumulators pressure and volumerequirements from 600 psig and a minimum of 814.5 ft3 and a maximum of829.5 ft3 to 615 psig and a minimum of 787.5 ft3 and a maximum of 802.5ft3 respectively. The changes are proposed to provide increased flexibilityin fuel management. 7. <T3>Boron Concentration and Shutdown Margin </T3>- The proposed revisionto Specification 3.8.B.2 would decrease the required shutdown margin duringrefueling from 10% delta k/k to 5% delta k/k and fix the minimum refuelingboron concentration at 2000 ppm. To maintain consistency Specification3.6.A.1 will also be revised to reflect the revised shutdown margin andminimum boron concentration. The changes are proposed to provide increasedflexibility in fuel management. 8. <T3>Power Distribution F delta H </T3>- The proposed revision to Specification3.10.2.1 would increase the allowable peak value of F delta H at 100% powerfrom 1.55 to 1.62. This change is proposed to increase flexibility in fuelmanagement. 9. <T3>Rod Drop Time </T3>- The proposed revision to Specification 3.10.8,Rod Drop Time, would change the control rod drop time interval of 1.8 secondsfrom loss of stationary gripper core voltage to dashpot entry to a controlrod drop time interval of 2.4 seconds from gripper release to dashpot entry.10. <T3>Hot Channel Factor F</T3><T2>Q</T2>(Z) - The proposed revision to Technical Specification 3.10 wouldrevise the normalized total peaking factor as a function of core height.This would increase the allowable normalized total peaking factor at theupper elevations of the reactor core and is being revised to reflect thenew LOCA analyses. 11. <T3>Low Pressure Safety Injection Setpoint </T3>- The proposed revisionto Table 3.5-1 changes the pressurizer low pressure safety injection setpointfrom 1700 to 1829 psig. The purpose of the proposed change is to accountfor possible instrument error. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). A proposed amendmentto an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsiderations if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) Create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previouslyevaluated; or (3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.In accordance with the above criteria, the licensee provided the followingno significant hazards analysis for the eleven categories of change discussedabove. <ITAG tagnum="21">1.

Improve Thermal Design Procedure and WRB-1 Correlation </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">...this change would not: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated. The ITDP and WRB-1 represent changesto analyses methods only. The probability of an accident occurring is notimpacted by the methods selected to evaluate the DNB design basis associatedwith that accident once it has been postulated to occur. The consequencesof the accident must satisfy the same DNB design basis as previously evaluated.Use of ITDP and the WRB-1 do not decrease the available DNB margins whenevaluating an accident. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accidentfrom any accident previously evaluated. The noted changes are to the methodsused in evaluating the DNB design basis only and are involved in analysesonly after an accident has been postulated to occur. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. With theproposed change, all safety criteria previously evaluated are still met,remain conservative, and continue to maintain the previous margins of safety.The DNB design criteria continues to be satisfied with the use of ITDPand the WRB-1. As described in the safety assessment, use of this improvedmethod and correlation do not decrease DNB margin over methods and correlationspreviously used in Indian Point Unit 2. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3.

With sampling every 720 hours, the six sampling canisters ineach of the two carbon beds would be used up in a year. Installing freshsample canisters requires opening and resealing the covers of the carbonbeds. By TS 4.7.6e, these operations require leak tests and penetrationtests which normally would not be required for 18 months. By extendingthe sampling interval from 720 hours to 1440 hours, the surveillance requiredby TS 4.7.6e would need to be performed only after the normal 18-monthinterval. The state of the art triethylenediamine-treated carbon adsorbershave been demonstrated by laboratory tests to remain highly efficient inadsorbing methyl iodide after extended operation. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists (10 CFR 50.92(c)). A proposed amendment toan operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards considerationif operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of anew or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee, in its submittal of December 21, 1987, provided the followingdiscussion and anlysis with regard to the three 10 CFR 50.92 standards:<ITAG tagnum="21">The OPERABILITY of the Control Room Area Ventilation System ensuresthat: (1) the ambient air temperature does not exceed the allowable temperaturefor continuous-duty rating for the equipment and instrumentation cooledby this system, and (2) the control room will remain habitable for operationspersonnel during and following all credible accident conditions. TechnicalSpecification 4.7.6, Control Room Area Ventilation System SurveillanceRequirements, ensures that the System remains operable as required. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Proposed Technical Specification 4.7.6.d seeks to extend the ControlRoom Ventilation System Carbon adsorber sample time interval from 720 hoursto 1440 hours because existing requirements are overly restrictive. CatawbaNuclear Station is equipped with state of the art Control Room VentilationSystem Carbon adsorbers which retain very high efficiencies over prolongedintervals of operation. Laboratory data support the efficiency of the Carbonadsorbers. Therefore, it is reasonable and justifiable to extend the carbonadsorber sample time interval as indicated in the proposed Technical Specification.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Existing Technical Specification 4.7.6.d indicates that each ControlRoom Area Ventilation System is to be demonstrated operable after every720 hours (30 days) of carbon adsorber operation by verifying within 31days after removal that a laboratory analysis of a representative carbonsample meets the laboratory testing criteria of Regulatory Position C.6.bof Regulatory Guide 1.52, Revision 2, March 1978, for a methyl iodide penetrationof less than 1%. The filter units in service at Catawba Nuclear Stationcurrently have no bypass mode. Therefore, either A train (1CRA-PFT-1) orB train (2CRA-PFT-1) must operate in the filtered mode continuously. Thisdesign configuration allows one unit to run continuously for 30 days beforea sample must be removed. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Each filter unit is initially provided with six installed sample canisters.If one canister is removed every 30 days (one canister from each unit isremoved every 2 months) the samples would be depleted after one year. Theremoved canisters are to be reloaded and reinstalled in the filter unit.Removal of the cover from the carbon bed jeopardizes Unit integrity anda refrigerant penetration leak rate test is required on the carbon bedwhenever the cover is removed. This results in the Technical Specification4.7.6.e surveillance test interval being reduced from the normal 18 monthto one year or less. Therefore the existing sampling interval is overlyrestrictive and results in excessive sampling of the Control Room pressurizingfilter units. Proposed Technical Specification 4.7.6.d would allow fora normal 18 month surveillance test interval (as required by existing TechnicalSpecification 4.7.6.e) by extending the Technical Specification 4.7.6.dsample interval from 720 hours to 1440 hours. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Historical data supports the proposed Technical Specification 4.7.6.dsampling interval of 1440 hours. Laboratory sample analysis results forfilter units 1CRA-PFT-1 and 2CRA-PFT-2 show that over the course of oneyear and more than 4,000 hours of run time per unit covering typical atmosphericand seasonal meteorological conditions, there was no noticeable degradationin the methly iodide efficiency of the carbon. The sample results variedfrom 99.98% to 99.95% for 1CRA-PFT-1 and from 99.99% to 99.90% efficiencyfor 2CRA-PFT-1. Therefore, the proposed extension of the Technical Specifications4.7.6.d sample interval is justifiable due to the high efficiency of thecarbon in 1CRA-PFT-1 and 2CRA-PFT-1 and their ability to retain their efficiencyover the course of prolonged operation as shown by the subject laboratorysample results. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The air flow rate through 1CRA-PFT-1 and 2CRA-PFT-2 is 6,000 cubicfeet per minute (CFM) of which 4,000 cfm is outside air and 2,000 is recirculatedControl Room area air. Since Catawba Nuclear Station is located in a ruralenvironment, away from any major industrial plants, the outside air isessentially clean and free of any industrial pollutants. Therefore, circulationof outside air through the filter units has no detrimental effect on theefficiency of the carbon. This phenomena is demonstrated by Catawba's carbonanalyses results from the start of plant operation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Additionally, the carbon utilized at Catawba Nuclear Station is activatedand impregnated with Triethylenediamine (TEDA). This type of carbon isa state-of-art-the-art material which results in high methyl iodide efficiencyas shown by laboratory analysis of the samples. The 720 hours run timeinterval recommended by Regulatory Guide 1.52 is an arbitrary value applyingto activated carbon. Since Catawba's carbon is activated impregnated withTEDA, the methyl iodide efficiency has been increased substantially. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In summary, the Control Room Ventilation System carbon adsorbers havebeen proven to maintain very high levels of Methyl Iodide efficiency underextended operation conditions. Laboratory analysis of carbon samples indicatethat extending the sampling interval to 1440 hours has an insignificanteffect on the efficiency of the adsorbers. Also, outside air circulatedthrough the adsorbers is of high quality and would not impact the efficiencyof the adsorbers even if sampling intervals are extended. Therefore, theproposed change to Technical Specification 4.7.6.d is reasonable and technicallyjustifiable. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.92, this analysis provides a determination thatthe proposed amendments to the Technical Specifications involves no significanthazards considerations if operation in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould not: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated; or </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accidentfrom any accident previously evaluated; or </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase inthe probability or consequences of any previously evaluated accident. CatawbaNuclear Station is equipped with state of the art Control Room VentilationSystem Carbon adsorbers which retain very high Methyl Iodide efficienciesover prolonged intervals of operation. Previous laboratory analysis resultsindicate that over the course of a one year and more than 4,000 hours ofruntime covering typical atmospheric and seasonal conditions, there isno noticeable degradation in the methyl iodide efficiency of the adsorberand that the carbon is perfectly capable of extended operation. Increasingthe Technical Specification 4.7.6.d sample time intervals to 1440 hourshas no significant impact to the efficiency of the carbon adsorbers andControl Room Area Ventilation System operability. Therefore, the proposedchange cannot increase the probability or consequences of any previouslyevaluated accident. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new ordifferent kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. Theproposed increase of Technical Specification 4.7.6.d sample time intervalsto 1440 hours has no effect on the function, operation, or efficiency ofthe Control Room Area Ventilation System. Therefore the proposed TechnicalSpecification change cannot create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction ina margin of safety. As it was previously indicated, the Catawba StationControl Room Ventilation System Carbon adsorbers are capable of extendedoperation without any significant reduction in their Methyl Iodide removalefficiency. Previous laboratory carbon sample analysis results indicatethat the proposed carbon adsorber sampling interval of 1440 hours willnot reduce the efficiency of the Control Room Ventilation System in anysignificant manner. Therefore, the proposed Technical Specification doesnot involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. </ITAG>The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's submittal and agrees that theproposed amendments would not have a significant adverse effect on thesafe operation of the facility. Laboratory tests and plant experience havedemonstrated the continued high adsorption efficiency of triethylenediamine-treatedcarbon after air ciculuation for 4000 hours. Also, contaminants such asindustrial pollutants which could affect the carbon adsorption efficiencyare absent in the pure outside air in the rural environment of the plant.The staff also agrees with the licensee's evaluation of the proposed amendmentwith respect to the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92. On this basis, the Commission has concluded that the requested amendmentsmeet the three standards and, therefore, has made a proposed determinationthat the amendment application does not involve a significant hazards consideration.<T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>York County Library, 138East Black Street, Rock Hill, South Carolina 29730 <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Mr. Albert Carr, Duke Power Company, 422South Church Street, Charlotte, North Carolina 28242 <T3>NRC Project Director: </T3>David B.

The changes are applicable toUnit 2 only. Unit 1 is included administratively because the TechnicalSpecifications are combined in one document for both units. The proposedchanges for Unit 2 would revise: (1) Table 2.2-1, Item 13.b. (2) Table 3.3-4, Items 5.b.2., 6.c.2., and 8.c.2) (3) the basis for Steam Generator Water Level, page B 2-7 Catawba Unit 2 is equipped with Westinghouse Model D5 steam generatorswhile Unit 1 has Model D3. A major difference between those two modelsis the design of the moisture separator section. Two aspects of this designdifference are of significance with respect to the proposed modification:(1) The D5 has a higher recirculation rate than the D3, and (2) the elevationof the lower deck plate in the D5 is higher than in the D3. Due to thesedifferences, the lower instrument tap for the narrow range level instrumentationwas located above the transition cone and lower deck plate on the D5 asopposed to below the transition cone in the downcomer in the D3. This hasresulted in significantly different operating characteristics. The proposedmodification will relocate the D5 lower instrument tap to the same locationas the D3. Due to the location of the lower tap in model D5 generators,the shrink and swell characteristics are more pronounced than in the D3model. This makes plant control difficult and more susceptible to trips.In order to determine the potential gain in operational control characteristicsof the D5 steam generator if the lower instrument tap were relocated tothe equivalent location as the D3, Duke and Westinghouse installed pilotinstrumentation on the Catawba 2C generator. Transient data have shownthat the modified D5 level instrumentation will perform similarly to theD3 in terms of post-trip response. The present span between the high level and low level trips on the D5 isphysically bounded by the elevation of the top of the moisture separatorswirl vanes and the elevation of the lower instrument tap, respectively.By relocating the lower tap, the lower level trip setpoint can be reduced.The high and operating level trip setpoints will also be reduced. The lowlevel trip setpoint will be set at the elevation of the lower deck plate.With this arrangement, the margin between the operating level setpointand low level trip setpoint will be increased from a current 42'' to 58''.This will make Unit 2 more tolerant to feedwater system malfunctions atpower, thus reducing unnecessary trips and corresponding challenges tosafety systems. Relocating the narrow range instrumentation lower sensing tap on the Westinghousemodel D5 steam generators to the same elevation as the model D3 steam generatorswould provide the following safety enhancements: (1) The effects of level shrink and swell at low power levels will be greatlyreduced, thus reducing the potential for reactor trips. (2) The time necessary to recover indicated level following a reactor tripwill be greatly reduced, thus reducing the potential for an overcoolingevent due to excessive auxiliary feedwater. (3) The margin to low level trip will be increased thus reducing the potentialfor reactor trips at power. Relocation of the level sensing tap to the downcomer region requires thatthe velocity induced error be accounted for in the determination of tripand operating level setpoints. This can be accomplished without reducingany current margin to trip. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists (10 CFR 50.92(c)). A proposed amendment toan operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards considerationsif operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of anew or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed amendments do not involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated because the WestinghouseSafety Evaluation discusses the transients not requiring any reanalysisas well as those that required reanalysis. Its findings indicated thatno conclusions in the Catawba Final Safety Analysis Report will be violatedby relocating the steam generator level taps. The licensee reviewed twoother events: (1) steam generator tube rupture and (2) loss-of-coolantaccident (LOCA) to evaluate the need for reanalyses. The licensee concludedthat no reanalyses were needed and that the conclusions of the currentanalyses remain bounding. The proposed amendments do not create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident from any accident previously evaluated because relocatingthe level tap on the D5 generator should improve operation and no new modesof operation are introduced. The proposed amendments do not involve a significant reduction in marginof safety because the modification would enhance safety by making the steamgenerators less susceptible to feedwater transients. This would reducethe potential for reactor and turbine trips and would avoid unnecessarytransients on the primary and secondary systems.

This request is a result of thelicensee's intent to use fuel of up to 4.2 percent enrichment during FuelCycle 9. The licensee is currently limited to storing fuel of 4.0 and 3.5percent enrichment in the dry fuel storage racks and storage pool A respectively.<T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided criteria for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists (10 CFR 50.92(c)). A proposed amendment toan operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards considerationsif operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of anew or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee addressed the above three criteria in the amendment applicationand made a no significant hazards consideration determination. In regardto the first criterion the licensee provided the following analysis: <ITAG tagnum="21">This amendment will not involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">An increase in fuel enrichment will not by itself affect the mixtureof fission product nuclides. A change in fuel cycle design which makesuse of an increased enrichment may result in fuel burnup consisting ofa somewhat different mixture of nuclides. The effect of this instance isinsignificant because: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) The isotopic mixture of the irradiated assembly is relativelyinsensitive to the assembly's initial enrichment. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) Most accident doses are such a small fraction of 10 CFR Part 100limits, a large margin exists before any change becomes significant. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(c) The change in Pu content which would result from an increase inburnup would produce more of some fission product nuclides and less ofother nuclides. Small increases in some doses are offset by reductionsin other doses. The radiological consequences of accidents are not significantlychanged. </ITAG>With respect to the second criterion the licensee stated: <ITAG tagnum="21">This amendment will not create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As indicated in the enclosed analyses, an unplanned criticality eventwill not occur as Keff will not exceed 0.95 with the maximum allowableenriched fuel in pool A, and flooded with unborated water, or the dry storageracks immersed in a water mist of 7.5% moderator density. Criticality ispossible for a mist environment only if the higher enriched fuel occupiesall of the locations in the dry storage racks including those which arerequired to be vacant. To prevent [this] occurrence, FPC commits to establishcontrols to preclude improper fuel storage. </ITAG>In regards to the third criterion the licensee provides the following statement:<ITAG tagnum="21">This amendment will not involve a significant reduction in a marginof safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">While the increased enrichment in pool A and the dry storage racksmay lessen the margin to criticality this reduction is not significantbecause the overall safety margin is within NRC criteria of Keff [lessthan] 0.95 (NRC Standard Review Plan, Section 9.2.1). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Therefore, this amendment request satisfies the criteria specifiedin 10 CFR 50.92 for amendments which do not involve a significant hazardsconsideration. </ITAG>The staff has reviewed the analysis provided by the licensee in supportof a no significant hazards consideration determination. The staff agreeswith the licensee's analysis and believes that the licensee has met thecriteria for such a determination.

The proposed amendment would revise the specifications relatedto fire protection systems at TMI-2. The proposed changes would align licenserequirements of fire protection systems consistent with the current, aswell as future plant conditions through the remainder of the current cleanupoperations. A revised definition of ``Fire Suppression Water System'', Section 1.13,is proposed. The definition describes the components of the fire suppressionwater system. The revised definition deletes the terms ``sprinkler'' and``spray system riser'' to be consistent with the revised requirements ofTechnical Specification 3.7.10.2 Deluge/Sprinkler Systems. The licensee proposes to revise Technical Specification 3.7.10.1, FireSuppression Water System, by eliminating one of four separate and redundanthigh pressure fire pumps and one of four separate water supplies supplyingwater to the pumps. The licensee further proposes to delete the requirementto maintain operability of the Unit 2 River Water Intake Diesel Fire Pumpand the Unit 2 River Water Intake Structure. The licensee also proposesto remove the terms ``sprinkler'' and ``spray system user'' to be consistentwith the revised requirements of Technical Specification 3.7.10.2 - Deluge/SprinklerSystems. Technical Specification 3.7.10.2 - Deluge/Sprinkler Systems, would be deletedby the licensee. The current Technical Specifications require deluge and/orsprinkler systems in a number of areas in the TMI-2 ventilation system.The purpose of this system is for suppression of charcoal filter firesin the ventilation system. The licensee has determined that the ventilationsystem is no longer necessary to maintain the safe shutdown condition ofthe plant or to maintain off-site doses to less than 10 CFR Part 100 limits.Section 3.7.10.3 - Halon System, requires that the Halon systems in theCable and Transformer Rooms and four zones of the air intake tunnel beoperable. The licensee proposes to delete this system. The licensee hasdetermined that these areas, protected by the Halon system and locatedoutside the Reactor Building, would not affect the safe shutdown conditionof the plant nor would it result in an off-site release greater than 10CFR Part 100 limits. Technical Specifications 3.7.11 - Penetration Fire Barriers, would be deletedby the licensee. The current Technical Specification requires that allpenetration fire barriers protecting safety related areas be functional.The November 17, 1987 revised Fire Protection Program Evaluation establishesthe Reactor Building as the only fire area. The licensee has determinedthat maintenance of the penetration fire barriers are not necessary toensure the safe shutdown of the facility. The licensee proposes to modify the Bases Section 3/4.3.3.8 and 3/4.3.3.9- Fire Detection Instrumentation, by making reference to the TMI-2 FireProtection Program Evaluation with regard to adequate fire warning capability,delete reference to safety related equipment and permit remote surveillancetechniques in lieu of fire patrols when fire detection instrumentationis inoperative. Bases Section 3/4.7.10 - Fire Suppression Systems, would be similarly modifiedmaking reference to the TMI-2 Fire Protection Program Evaluation with regardto adequate fire suppression capability, and delete reference to the firesuppression system capability to minimize potential damage to safety relatedequipment. The Basis currently refers to four main fire pumps in the firesuppression system. Consistent with the changes proposed in Section 3.7.10.1,the Basis would be changed to refer to three main fire pumps. The licenseealso proposes to delete the reference to the necessity for immediate correctivemeasures should the fire suppression water system become inoperative. Thelicensee proposes instead to state that the inoperability of the systemwould not affect the capability to maintain the safe shutdown conditionof the plant nor the capability to prevent off-site releases greater than10 CFR Part 100 limits. The licensee would retain the statement that ifportions of the fire suppression system are inoperable, alternate backupfire fighting equipment would be made available in affected areas untilthe affected equipment could be restored to service. The licensee proposes to delete Basis Section 3/4.7.11 Penetration FireBarriers, consistent with the request to delete Section 3.7.11 - PenetrationFire Barriers. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists in 10 CFR 50.92(c). A proposed amendment toan operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards considerationif operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated, (2) create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated, or(3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. TMI-2 is currently in a post-accident, cold shutdown, long-term cleanupmode, with sufficient decay heat removal assured by direct heat loss fromthe reactor coolant system to the reactor building atmosphere. The licenseeis presently engaged in defueling the damaged reactor, decontaminatingthe facility and readying the plant for long-term storage. As of the endof December 1988, approximately 70 percent of the fuel contained in thereactor vessel has been removed. Defueling the facility has progressedto the regions below the location of the original core volume. Defuelingactivities within the reactor building will be completed by fall of 1989.The staff has determined in previous license amendments, that the potentialaccidents analyzed for TMI-2 in the current cleanup-mode are bounded inscope and severity by the range of accidents originally analyzed in thefacility FSAR. The changes proposed by the licensee are changes to theAppendix A Technical Specifications reducing the fire protection requirementsnecessary to assure the safe shutdown of the facility. Since the facilityis in a safe shutdown configuration, the reactor system is not pressurizedand the core is partially defueled the licensee asserts that a reductionin fire protection measures is warranted and that off-site doses, evenin the event of a fire, would be less than 10 CFR Part 100 limits. The proposed changes do not significantly increase the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated. The proposed changes to the TechnicalSpecifications are based on a safety analysis contained in the November17, 1987 Fire Protection Plan Evaluation (FPPE) submitted by the licenseein support of the proposed changes. The FPPE concludes that maintenanceof only one fire area, the TMI-2 Reactor Building, is justified and thatthis assumption will not affect either the capability to maintain the monitoredsafe shutdown condition of the plant nor result in off-site doses greaterthan 10 CFR Part 100 limits. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident from any accident previously evaluated because no newmodes of operation or new equipment are being introduced. The proposedchanges do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety sincethe changes are consistent with the results of the recent Fire ProtectionProgram Evaluation and do not affect the capability of the licensee tomaintain the safe shutdown condition of the facility nor result in thepossibility of off-site doses greater than 10 CFR Part 100 limits. Theproposed changes will still require fire detection and suppression capabilityin the Reactor Building. Based on the above considerations, the staff proposes to determine thatthe proposed changes do not involve a significant hazards consideration.<T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>State Library of PennsylvaniaGovernment Publications Section, Education Building, Walnut Street andCommonwealth Avenue, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania 17126. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Ernest L.

Stolz <ITAG tagnum="84">Louisiana Power and Light Company, Docket No. 50-382, Waterford SteamElectric Station, Unit 3, St. Charles Parish, Louisiana </ITAG><T3>Date of amendment request: </T3>December 23, 1988 <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>The proposed amendment wouldchange the Technical Specifications to show a new location for one of thebackup seismic monitors. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92. A proposed amendmentto an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with a proposedamendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated, (2) create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated,or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The seismic monitor being moved is currently in a location to detect peakaccelerations on the reactor coolant system (RCS) piping by being attachedto a pipe directly connected to the RCS piping. The location, however,is in a harsh environment subject to vibrations from a reactor coolantpump. The environment and vibrations continually damage the monitor renderingit useless. The new location will also place the monitor on a connectedpipe to the RCS and should provide comparable information with less chanceof unrelated damage. These backup seismic monitors do not influence anyaccident previously evaluated except possibly for the small added weightof the monitor on the connecting pipe. The licensee has evaluated the effectsof the added weight at the new location; the weight does not cause thenew seismic stress valves to exceed any limits. Therefore, the proposedchange does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof any accident previously evaluated. The monitor provides backup information to verify seismic induced stresscalculations. It is not powered by external power sources and the weightat the new location should have no effect on the piping. The mounting clampand monitor meet seismic Category 1 requirements and should not fall duringa seismic event and local pipe whip restraints should prevent the monitorsfrom becoming missiles after a postulated pipe break. Therefore, the proposedchange will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accidentpreviously evaluated. The monitor provides backup recording to verify seismic induced stresscalculations. The new location still provides information on the RCS pipingand the monitor should have no effect on the new piping location. The currentlocation renders the monitor useless while the new location restores themargin of safety as a backup monitor as originally required. Thereforethe proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a marginof safety. Based on the above, the staff proposes to determine that the change doesnot involve a significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room Location: </T3>University of New OrleansLibrary, Louisiana Collection, Lakefront, New Orleans, Louisiana 70122<T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Bruce W.

(b) The revision of the MAPLHGR curve for 8x8 fuel during Single LOOP Operation(SLO). (c) The revision of flow dependent thermal limits, MAPFAC<T2>p</T2>, and MCPR<T2>f</T2>, based on all ANF core for Cycle 4.

The licensee's analysis of theproposed amendment against the three standards in 10 CFR 50.92 is reproducedbelow. <ITAG tagnum="21">1. a) This change introduces one MAPLHGR limit for the new 8x8 fuel.This change only introduces a new MAPLHGR limit and does not affect theprecursors to any event previously evaluated. Therefore, this change doesnot involve a significant increase in the probability of any event previouslyevaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The peak clad temperature (PCT) for the new 8x8 fuel was calculatedbased on the same bounding MAPLHGR limit which was used in the analysesfor Cycles 2 and 3. [The MAPLHGR operating limits in the Technical Specificationsfor Cycles 2, 3 and 4 are bounded by the MAPLHGR limit used in LOCA analysis.]Small variations in PCT, compared to the bounding PCT calculated in Cycle2, are observed as a result of minor fuel design differences (e.g., latticeradial enrichment, and therefore, power distribution). The maximum increasein PCT relative to Cycle 2 is 11 degrees F at 20 GWd/MTU. This increaseis negligible compared to the calculated PCT which is more than 500 degreesbelow the 10 CFR 50.46 limit of 2200 degrees F. Therefore, the proposedchange does not involve a significant increase in the consequences of anyevent previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b) This change consists of a revision to the SLO MAPLHGR limit forthe 8x8 fuel types. It only redefines the SLO MAPLHGR limit and does notaffect the precursors to any event previously evaluated. Therefore, thischange does not involve a significant increase in the probability of anyevent previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The revised SLO MAPLHGR limit conservatively bounds, during Cycle4, the individual MAPLHGR limits for the 8x8 fuel types. Therefore, thischange does not involve a significant increase in the consequences of anyevent previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c) This change consists of revisions to the MCPR<T2>f</T2> and MAPFAC<T2>f</T2> limits. The revised limits are based on ANF's methodology, aredefined for specific modes of operation and do not take credit for thecore flow limiter. These changes only redefine the flow dependent thermallimits and do not affect the precursors to any event evaluated previously.Therefore, these changes do not involve a significant increase in the probabilityof any event evaluated previously. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As a result of this change, both reduction and increase in the Cycle3 limits are observed. However, the revised MCPR<T2>f</T2> and MAPFAC<T2>f</T2> operating limits were constructed in a conservative manner.The limiting flow runout event will not cause the plant to exceed the MCPRsafety limit or the LHGR 120% overpower line even with the plant initiallyat the revised operating limits. Therefore, the proposed changes do notinvolve a significant increase in the consequences of any event previouslyevaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d) This change consists of a revision to the MCPR<T2>p</T2> limit. The revised MCPR<T2>p</T2> limit is based on ANF's methodology applied to a full ANF core.The limit is lower than the Cycle 3 limit above 40% of rated power up to,but not including, 100% power. Below 40% of rated power and at 100% power,the limit is unchanged. This change only redefines the MCPR<T2>p</T2> limit and does not affect the precursors to any event previouslyevaluated. Therefore, this change does not involve a significant increasein the probability of any event previously evaluated. Cycle 4 analysisdemonstrated that the limiting events will result in a CPR above the MCPR<T2>p</T2> operating limit. Therefore, the proposed change does not involvea significant increase in the consequences of any event previously evaluated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">e) This change addresses the introduction of four (4) LTAs into thecore for Cycle 4 operation. The thermal, mechanical and neutronic performanceof the LTAs has been determined for the limiting events evaluated by ANFfor Cycle 4. The LTAs have been determined for the limiting events evaluatedby ANF for Cycle 4. The LTAs have been shown to be compatible with theco-resident 8x8 fuel assemblies. Therefore, introduction of the LTAs duringCycle 4 does not affect the precursors to any event evaluated previouslyfor 8x8 fuel. Therefore, this change does not involve a significant increasein the probability of any event previously evaluated for 8x8 fuel. TheCycle 4 reload analysis shows that the LTA performance is bounded by theperformance of the co-resident 8x8 fuel. This is ensured by the LTAs beingplaced in non-limiting core locations. Therefore, the introduction of LTAsdoes not involve a significant increase in the consequences of any eventpreviously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">f) This change is administrative. Therefore, it does not involve asignificant increase in the probability or consequences of an accidentpreviously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">g) These changes are administrative. Therefore, they do not involvea significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accidentpreviously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Overall, the proposed changes define parameters determined conservativelyand consistent with the fuel which will be resident in the core duringCycle 4. They do not affect the precursors to any accident previously evaluated.These changes, therefore, do not involve a significant increase in theprobability or consequence of any accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The new 8x8 fuel type is of a design similar to the fuel presentin the core. It has been determined by ANF that the 9x9x-5 LTA is compatiblewith the 8x8 fuel and will not create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident. The proposed changes do not involve any new modes ofoperation, any plant modifications or any changes to setpoints. Therefore,the proposed changes do not result in the creation of any new precursorsto any accident. They only introduce new and revised MAPLHGR, LHGR andoff-rated power and flow limits. These limits have been determined usingmethodologies similar to those used for previous cycles. The administrativechanges have no effect on any accidents. Therefore, the proposed changesdo not create the possibility of a new or different type of accident fromany accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. a) This change introduces one MAPLHGR limit for the new 8x8 fuel.The peak clad temperature (PCT) for the new 8x8 fuel was calculated basedon the same bounding MAPLHGR limit which was used in the analyses for Cycles2 and 3. Small variations in PCT, compared to the bounding PCT calculatedin Cycle 2 are observed as a result of minor fuel design differences (e.g.,lattice radial enrichment, and therefore, power distribution). The maximumincrease in PCT relative to Cycle 2 is 11 degrees F at 20 GWd/MTU. Theavailable margin to the 10CFR50.46 limit of 2200 degrees F at this exposureis greater than 500 degrees F. Therefore, the introduction of the new MAPLHGRlimit does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b) This change consists of a revision to the SLO MAPLHGR limit for8x8 fuel. The revised SLO MAPLHGR curve conservatively bounds, during Cycle4, the individual MAPLHGR limits for all 8x8 fuel types. The method usedto calculate off-rated MAPLHGR limits in Cycle 3 is maintained for Cycle4. Therefore, revision of the SLO MAPLHGR limit does not involve a significantreduction in the margin of safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c) This change consists of revisions to the MCPR<T2>f</T2> and MAPFAC<T2>f</T2> operating limits. The revised limits are based on ANF's methodology,are defined for specific modes of operation and do not take credit forthe use of the core flow limiter. The revised MCPR<T2>f</T2> limit is based on a conservative bound of the maximum achievablecore flow (110% of rated) for the limiting flow runout event. The Cycle3 limits are based on maximum core flows of 102.5 and 107% of rated. Therevised MCPR<T2>f</T2> limits are in general lower than the Cycle 3 MCPR<T2>f</T2> operating limits. However, the ANF Cycle 4-specific safety analysesshow an adequate margin to the safety limit. The MCPR<T2>f</T2> limit consists of two curves corresponding to Non-Loop Manualand Loop Manual modes of operation. For Non-Loop Manual modes, the limitingflow runout event consists of a two loop runout whereas for Loop Manualmode, the limiting event consists of a one loop runout. Therefore, thelimiting consequences (flow increase and the associated delta CPR) in theLoop Manual mode are smaller than in the Non-Loop Manual modes, resultingin an added CPR margin for the LOOP Manual mode. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The MCPR<T2>f</T2> operating limit is constructed based on a number of conservativeassumptions: 1) The increase in flow rate for both one and two loop runoutevents are [sic] conservative (see report NESDQ-88-003), 2) the ANF analysisassumes a conservative rod-line for the limiting flow runout event, and3) the MCPR<T2>f</T2> limit includes an added conservatism to address performancevariations in subsequent cycles (NESDQ-88-003 and ANF-88-149, Figure 5.1).With the plant initially at the revised MCPR<T2>f</T2> operating limit, the limiting flow run-out event, for both LoopManual and Non-Loop Manual operations, will result in a final CPR abovethe MCPR safety limit. This ensures that an adequate margin of safety isavailable. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The basis for determining the MAPFAC<T2>f</T2> limits is similar to that used in determining the MCPR<T2>f</T2> limits. The MAPFAC<T2>f</T2> limit consists of two curves corresponding to Non-Loop Manualand Loop Manual modes of operation. The change in MAPFAC<T2>f</T2> under the more restrictive Loop Manual mode (one loop runout)is smaller than under the Non-Loop Manual modes (two loop runout). Theconservatisms associated with the assumed flow increases and the analysisrod-line described above for the MCPR<T2>f</T2> related analyses are applied to the MAPFAC<T2>f</T2> analyses as well. With the plant initially on the revised MAPFAC<T2>f</T2> limit, the limiting flow runout event, for both Loop Manualand Non-Loop Manual operations, will result in a final MAPFAC<T2>f</T2> below the 120% overpower line. This assures an adequate marginof safety for this event. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Therefore, the proposed changes in the MCPR<T2>f</T2> and MAPFAC<T2>f</T2> limits do not involve a significant reduction in the marginof safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d) This change consists of a revision to the MCPR<T2>p</T2> limit. The revised MCPR<T2>p</T2> limit is based on ANF's methodology applied for a full ANF core.The limit is lower than the Cycle 3 limit above 40% of rated power up to,but not including, 100% power. Below 40% of rated power and at 100% power,the limit is unchanged. Cycle 4 analysis demonstrated that even with theplant initially on the revised MCPR<T2>p</T2> operating limit, the analyzed limiting core-wide transientsand local events will result in a CPR above the MCPR safety limit. Therefore,the proposed change in the MCPR<T2>p</T2> limit does not involve a significant reduction in the marginof safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">e) This change addresses the introduction of four (4) LTAs into thecore for Cycle 4 operation. The thermal and mechanical performance of theLTAs for the limiting events analyzed by ANF for Cycle 4 is bounded bythe performance of the 8x8 fuel. MAPLHGR and LHGR curves specific to the9x9-5 LTA have been developed. These curves were developed using the samemethods as were used for the 8x8 fuel. Comparable margins to the PCT andmechanical design limits were shown to be available for the LTAs. Additionalmargin is introduced by placing the LTAs in non-limiting core locations.Therefore, the introduction of four (4) LTAs does not involve a significantreduction in the margin of safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">f) This change is administrative. Therefore, it does not involve asignificant reduction in the margin of safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">g) These changes are administrative. Therefore, they do not involvea significant reduction in the margin of safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Therefore, these changes ((a) through (g)) do not involve a significantreduction in the margin of safety. </ITAG>The licensee has concluded that the proposed amendment meets the threestandards in 10 CFR 50.92 and, therefore, involves no significant hazardsconsideration.

The licensee's analysis of theproposed amendment against the three standards in 10 CFR 50.92 is reproducedbelow. <ITAG tagnum="21">1. The proposed changes are intended to provide operational flexibilityduring the upcoming refueling outage while ensuring core decay heat removalcapability, ECCS water injection requirements and primary and secondarycontainment capability. SERI has developed and implemented a managementphilosophy for effective control of potential vessel draining and decayheat removal during plant outages. This philosophy has been implementedby policy as a Technical Specification Position Statement which requires:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a) At least one ECCS and one Fuel Pool Cooling subsystem functionalat all time. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b) At least one shutdown cooling subsystem of RHR remain functionalexcept for periods of required maintenance or testing. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c) The emergency diesel/generator associated with the one requiredECCS, Fuel Pool Cooling, and Shutdown Cooling subsystem be functional (andOPERABLE when possible). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d) Any alternate shutdown cooling subsystem must be demonstrated tobe able to remove reactor decay heat load existing at the time the systemis required. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In addition, it is SERI's outage philosophy to minimize the time inTS action statements associated with the above systems such that theseaction statements are only entered for required maintenance, testing, inspections,and modifications. Any exceptions to the above must receive prior PlantSafety Review Committee review and approval. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. This policy has been successfully executed and demonstrated effectivein previous refueling outages. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase inthe probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. SERIhas evaluated UFSAR Chapter 15 events which are considered to be applicableduring OPERATIONAL CONDITIONs 4 and 5. These events include a dropped fuelbundle and inadvertent criticality. The proposed Specification 3.0.4 exceptionscannot affect the probability of occurrence of any of these events. Theproposed 3.0.4 exceptions would have no effect on fuel handling operationsin the containment or in the spent fuel pool because fuel handling proceduresand methods remain unchanged. The proposed changes have no effect on controlrod interlocks or fuel loading errors and thus do not affect the probabilityof occurrence of an inadvertent criticality. The proposed changes willallow the following evolutions to occur during the third refueling outagewhile in the action statements of the affected TS: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Tensioning and detensioning the reactor vessel head. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Lowering the reactor cavity water level to less than 22 feet 8inches above the reactor pressure vessel flange. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. Performance core alternations and handling irradiated fuel whilerelying on the provisions of ACTION b and c of TS 3.6.4 and 3.6.6.2. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. The above listed evolutions will be performed while in the actionstatements associated with ECCS operating and shutdown requirements, provisionsconcerning the number of RHR shutdown cooling loops required OPERABLE,provisions concerning primary containment, drywell and secondary containmentcapability and control room emergency filtration system. Without the requestedTS 3.0.4 exceptions, the required systems would have to be made operablejust to perform the above evolutions and then they may be made inoperableagain for maintenance and testing purposes. The evolution of making systemsoperable just to change operational conditions or other specified conditionsrepresents significant impact on the refueling outage. With the proposedchanges the outage length can be significantly decreased with no significantimpact to overall plant safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. The proposed changes do not affect the consequences of an accidentpreviously evaluated. SERI policy looks at the overall outage plan andattempts to optimize testing and maintenance periods on ECCS and decayheat removal systems in order to ensure optimum availability while at thesame time accomplishing required maintenance and testing activities. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">6. The proposed changes involving RHR shutdown cooling affect Specifications3.4.9.2 ACTIONs a and b, 3.7.1.1 ACTIONs b and d, 3.7.1.3 ACTION a, and3.9.11.2. The action statements of Specifications 3.4.9.2 and 3.9.11.2contain provisions to establish alternate methods of decay heat removal,when necessary, with RHR shutdown cooling loops inoperable. These alternatemethods of decay heat removal are procedurally prescribed prior to enteringan outage based on available equipment and planned outage activities. Sincedecay heat removal is provided for in the action statements of the affectedspecifications, entry into the OPERATIONAL CONDITIONs with less than therequired number of RHR Shutdown Cooling Loops available does not involvea significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accidentpreviously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">7. The proposed change to Specification 3.7.1.1 ACTIONs b and andd and 3.7.1.3 ACTION a affect the SSW subsystems and ultimate heat sinkthat support the RHR shutdown cooling loops. With an SSW subsystem inoperable,its associated RHR shutdown cooling loop is also required by TechnicalSpecifications to be declared inoperable. Changing OPERATIONAL CONDITIONsor other specified conditions with this SSW subsystem and associated RHRshutdown cooling loop inoperable represents no significant increase inthe probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">8. The proposed changes to Specification 3.5.2 and 3.7.1.1 ACTIONc will allow operational condition changes with one ECCS subsystem/systemOPERABLE. Since only OPERATIONAL CONDITIONs 4 and 5* are affected, presentTS indicate that one ECCS subsystem/system is sufficient for water makeuprequirements for the four hour time allowance of ACTION c of Specification3.5.2. The proposed change to ACTION c of Specification 3.7.1.1 is similarto that for ACTIONs b and d such that when equipment is out of service,a support system such as SSW is not required to be OPERABLE for that ECCSfunction. Since ECCS makeup capability is provided while in ACTION a ofSpecification 3.5.2, the proposed change does not involve a significantincrease in the probability of consequences of an accident previously evaluated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">9. The proposed change to 3.5.3 ACTION c will allow operation of theAlternate Decay Heat Removal System (ADHRS) which requires declaring inoperablea division of suppression pool water level instrumentation. TS 3.0.4 presentlyrestricts changing operational conditions while relying on the provisionsof that action. ADHRS operation causes the inoperability of one divisionof suppression pool level instrumentation which causes entry into ACTIONc of TS 3.5.3. This action requires that suppression pool level be verifiedonce per 12 hours by an alternate indicator. Operational condition or specifiedcondition changes cannot be made while relying on the provisions of theACTION even though suppression pool level can be verified by an alternateindicator. Since an alternate means of verifying suppression pool levelis provided by ACTION c of Specification 3.5.3, the proposed change doesnot involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences ofan accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">10. The proposed changes involving drywell, primary containment andsecondary containment isolation valves affect Specification 3.6.4 ACTIONsb and c and Specification 3.6.6.2 ACTIONs b and c. The action statementsof those specifications provide provisions for isolating affected penetrationswhen one or more of the associated isolation valves or dampers are inoperable.The action involves isolating the affected penetration by use of at leastone deactivated automatic valve secured in the isolated position or byuse of at least one closed manual valve or blind flange such that the safetyfunction of the valve or damper is accomplished. Because the affected penetrationsare isolated in accordance with the specified actions, changing operationalor other specified conditions while relying on the provisions of the actiondoes not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">11. The proposed change involving the control room emergency filtrationsystem affects Specification 3.7.2 ACTION b.1. The action statement ofthat specification provides provisions for OPERATIONAL CONDITIONs 4, 5and `*'' when one of the two required control room emergency filtrationsystem subsystems are inoperable. The action requires restoration of theinoperable subsystem within seven days or initiate and maintain operationof the OPERABLE subsystem in the isolation mode of operation. Since emergencyfiltration capability is provided by the OPERABLE subsystem, changing operationalconditions or other specified conditions with less than the required numberof control room emergency filtration subsystems does not involve a significantincrease in the probability or consequences of an accident. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">12. The proposed change does not increase the possibility of a newor different kind of accident from any previously analyzed. The proposedchanges do not increase the amount of time ECCS, RHR shutdown cooling loopsor control room emergency filtration subsystems are unavailable nor dothe changes reduce the drywell, containment or secondary containment isolationcapability. The proposed changes do not increase the potential for drainingthe reactor vessel. Since the above safety systems are maintained, thereis no possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previouslyanalyzed. The proposed changes are intended to increase outage flexibilitywhile maintaining necessary levels of plant safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">13. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction ina margin of safety. The proposed Specification 3.0.4 exceptions will stillensure that core decay heat removal, ECCS makeup capabilities, controlroom emergency filtration capability, and drywell, containment and secondarycontainment capability are available when required during the refuelingoutage. In addition to Technical Specification action requirements, SERIis to maintain at least one ECCS system and one Fuel Pool Cooling and Cleanupsystem functional at all time during the outage. RHR shutdown cooling loopswill be functional unless maintenance or testing removes them from service.SERI's outage policy will minimize time in the action statements as muchas possible. Since essential safety systems are available as necessaryduring the outage, the change does not involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety. </ITAG>The licensee has concluded that the proposed amendment meets the threestandards in 10 CFR 50.92 and, therefore, involves no significant hazardsconsideration.

The proposed change to the TS would incorporateLimiting Conditions for Operation (LCO) and Surveillance Requirements (SRs)for the Reactor Vessel Coolant Level (RVCL) instrumentation into TS 3/4.3.3.8,``Instrumentation - Accident Monitoring.'' <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The RVCL instrumentation for Millstone Unit 2 is based upon the heatedjunction thermocouple technology for post-accident determination of reactorpressure vessel water inventory. In our safety evaluations dated April18, 1985 and August 28, 1986, the NRC staff addressed the adequacy of theRVCL instrumentation for Millstone Unit 2. The need for RVCL instrumentationand associated TS was one of a number of post-TMI initiatives that hadbeen established by the NRC staff. Based upon discussions with the NRCstaff, and applications for license amendments dated October 14, 1986 andJuly 21, 1987, the licensee has submitted revised proposed LCOs and SRsfor the RVCL instrumentation in a letter dated January 12, 1989. The proposed LCO for the RVCL instrumentation would require at least oneof the two channels to be operable. In the event that no channel is operableeither restore the unoperable channel(s) to operable status in 48 hoursor: 1. Prepare and submit a special report to the Commission pursuant to Specification6.9.2 within 30 days following the event outlining the action taken, thecause of the inoperability, and the plans and schedule for restoring thesystem to operable status; and 2. Restore the system to operable status at the next scheduled refueling;and 3. Initiate an alternate method of monitoring the reactor vessel inventory.The SRs for the RVCL instrumentation includes monthly channel checks (adetermination of operability) and calibration of the instrumentation (fromthe electronic cabinets only) during refueling. The approval of similar,generic, requirements is contained in a letter from Mr. D. Crutchfield,NRC, to Mr. R.W. Wells, Chairman, Combustion Engineering Owners Group,dated October 28, 1986. On March 6, 1986, the NRC provided guidance in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(51 FR 7751) concerning examples of amendmentsthat are not likely to involve significant hazards consideration. One exampleof amendments not likely to involve significant hazards considerationsis example (ii) which involves ``A change that constitutes an additionallimitation, restriction, or control not presently included in the technicalspecifications, e.g., a more stringent surveillance requirement.'' Theproposed change to TS 3/4.3.3.8 would incorporate LCOs and SRs for theRVCL instrumentation into the TS. The proposed change to the TS is thusjudged to be within the scope of example (ii), above.

(the licensee), requested changesto Millstone Unit 3 Technical Specification (TS) 4.7.10b, ``Snubbers'',to allow an approximate two month extension in snubber visual inspections,to allow continued operation until the next refueling outage. Technical Specification 4.7.10b requires that snubbers on safety-relatedcomponents and piping be visually inspected at various intervals dependingupon snubber failure rate determined by the previous inspection. An increasednumber of snubber failures would decrease the surveillance intervals fromas great as 18 months 27 25% to as little as 31 days 27 25%. The currentinspection interval for Millstone Unit 3 is 18 months for all snubbersexcept for Type PSA-1/2 and PSA-1/4, which have a 12 month interval. Duringthe last round of inspections, the licensee found all snubbers operablewhich enabled the licensee to increase the inspection interval for theType PSA-1/2 and PSA-1/4 snubbers to 12 months. The next required inspectioninterval would end April 30, 1989. The licensee has requested that thesurveillance interval be extended to allow snubber inspection during thenext refueling outage, which is scheduled to begin on May 20, 1989. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3> Title 10 CFR 50.92, ``Issuance of amendment'', contains standards for evaluatingthe existence of no significant hazards consideration.

Specifically, the proposed changesto the TSs, which would become effective after the installation of thedigital feedwater control system, are as follows: 1. Specification 2.3.A.3(c) dealing with the reactor trip setpoints of``low steam generator water level - greater than or equal to 15% of thenarrow range instrument in coincidence with steam/feedwater mismatch flow- greater than or equal to 1.0x106 lbs/hr'' would be deleted. 2. Specification Table TS.3.5-2, item 18 dealing with low feedwater flowreactor trip, would be deleted. 3. Specification Table TS.4.1-1, item 12, Steam Generator Flow Mismatch,would be modified so that surveillance would be performed on steam flowchannels only since feedwater flow channels would no longer be used inthe protection circuit. The licensee also proposes to revise the bases to reflect the removal ofthe low feedwater flow reactor trip. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided guidance concerning the application ofstandards for making a no significant hazards consideration determinationby providing certain examples (51 FR 7751). One of the examples is (ix):A repair or replacement of a major component or system important to safety,if the following conditions are met: (1) The repair or replacement process involves practices which have beensuccessfully implemented at least once on similar components or systemselsewhere in the nuclear industry or in other industries, and does notinvolve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of anaccident previously evaluated or create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; and (2) The repaired or replacement component or system does not result ina significant change in its safety function or a significant reductionin any safety limit (or limiting condition of operation) associated withthe component or system. The replacement feedwater control system that utilizes a median signalselector function has been installed at several other plants where it demonstrateda superior means of feedwater flow control as compared to the existingcontrol systems. This advanced means of controlling feedwater flow eliminatesthe possibility of flow transient conditions, and therefore the need fora reactor trip initiated by low feedwater flow or low steam generator waterlevel becomes unnecessary. The setpoint parameters associated with thesteam generator water level and feedwater flow have not been factored intoanalyses of any of the previously analyzed accidents. Therefore, the eliminationof these reactor trip settings does not involve a significant increasein the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluatedor create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from anyaccident previously evaluated. In addition, the proposed changes will inno way alter the safety function of the feedwater control system or resultin a significant reduction in any safety limits associated with the feedwatercontrol system.

The amendment replaces in its entirety anearlier amendment dated September 7, 1988 for which notice of considerationwas provided in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on October 19, 1988 [53 FR 40996]. Accordingly,this notice replaces and supersedes in its entirety the Notice of October19, 1988. The deficiencies were identified as a result of revised voltageregulation studies. The studies were based in part on the considerationthat, under certain offsite power emergency conditions, the voltage providedto the station's offsite power supply transformers could be lower thanpreviously assumed. The study also modeled the plant's power distributionsystem to a greater level of detail. The proposed changes are grouped into two categories. The Category A changesaddress the degraded grid protection relays, and involve providing protectiverelays on each 4.16kV bus (with revised voltage setpoints) and increasingthe time delay for the 4.16kV bus to transfer to an alternate power supply.Category B changes address the Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) loadingsequence. The Category A changes involve two independent offsite power sources whichare referred to as the start-up sources. The 4160 volt (4.16kV) bus feederbreakers provide the interface between the two offsite power sources andthe plant safety-related AC power distribution system. Each of the four4.16kV buses in each unit can be powered by either of the two offsite powersupplies. Each of the 4.16kV buses can also be powered from a safety relateddiesel generator. Each startup source to each 4.16kV bus is equipped with an instantaneousundervoltage protective relay. Each relay is presently set to initiateat 90% of nominal voltage on the 4.16kV bus. The purpose of these relaysis to ensure that adequate levels of voltage are provided to the motorsand control components which are powered from the 480V motor control centers(MCCs) which are fed from the 4.16kV buses. After a 0.1 second internaltime delay the degraded voltage protective relays initiate time delay relayswhich transfer the 4.16kV bus to an alternate supply source if the normalsupply source does not recover to the instantaneous relay reset value (currently93%) in a set period of time. The control circuit logic to the time delayrelays distinguishes between an undervoltage condition without a safetyinjection signal and one concurrent with a safety injection signal. Withouta safety injection signal, a time delay relay will initiate the transfer60 seconds after initiation of the instantaneous relay if the voltage doesnot recover. With a safety injection signal, another time delay relay will initiatethe transfer six seconds after initiation of the instantaneous relay ifthe voltage does not recover. The purpose of the six second delay is tominimize the time that safety-related equipment is exposed to the undervoltagecondition, yet allow the voltage to recover from the dips caused by accelerationof the large safety-related motors. In either case, if the voltage of thenormal supply has not recovered before the time delay relays initiate thetransfer, the associated source breaker is tripped and the bus is loadedonto an alternate power supply. The alternate supply for an 4.16kV busis, in order of preference, the remaining offsite power source, then theemergency diesel generator. The revised voltage regulation study identifiedthat under the scenario of a safety injection signal on one unit whileoperating with only one of two offsite power sources (permitted for sevendays by Limiting Condition for Operation 3.9.B.1), the existing six secondstime delay setting is inadequate. The existing six second timer setting,along with the 0.1 second internal delay, would not allow sufficient accelerationtime for the core spray pump motors. Therefore, even after a 6.1 seconddelay, the core spray pump motors, which are currently started simultaneously,will not be at rated speed (based on design acceleration versus voltagevalues) thereby not allowing voltage recovery on the 4.16kV buses, andall four 4.16kV bus feeder breakers will trip, thus loading each bus ontoits associated diesel generator. This would represent a reduction in defensein depth since it is desirable, if offsite power is available, to supplythese loads from the offsite power supply without reliance on the backupdiesel generators. The licensee has identified two categories of changesto address this concern. The Category A changes deal with the offsite power source and include thefollowing: (1) Revise Technical Specification Table 3.2.B on page 71a todesignate the presence of undervoltage protective relays (two per 4.16kVbus) which actuate under LOCA conditions and set at ``89% of rated voltage27 0.3% of setting (3702 volts 27 11 volts) with a ``0.9 - 1.1 second internaltime delay'' and undervoltage protective relays (two per 4.16kV bus) whichactuate under non-LOCA conditions and are set at ``98% of rated voltage27 0.3% of setting (4077 volts 27 12 volts)'' with a ``0.9 - 1.1 secondinternal time delay'' instead of ``90% (+/-2%) of rated voltage,'' andreplace the ``(ITE)'' in the trip function column with ``(27N)''; (2) ReviseTable 3.2.B on page 71a to designate the trip level setting for the LOCAtime delay relays as ``9 second 27 7% (27 0.6 sec.) time delay'' insteadof ``6 second (+/-5%) time delay.'' Express the tolerance of the ``non-LOCA''relay in terms of seconds (27 5% as 27 3 sec.); (3) Revises Bases section3.2 on page 93a to reflect the presence of separate relays for LOCA andnon-LOCA conditions, with the LOCA relay set at 89% and the non-LOCA relayset at 98%. The Category B changes deal with revising the scheme for the sequentialloading of the residual heat removal (RHR) and the core spray (CS) pumps.The four CS pumps and the four RHR pumps of the Emergency Core CoolingSystem (ECCS) are powered from the 4.16kV buses. In the event of a LOCAwith offsite power available, the RHR and CS pumps are loaded sequentiallyonto the 4.16kV buses to preclude severe voltage transients from the simultaneousstarting of the pumps. The present loading sequence for the RHR and CSpumps in the event of the safety injection signal with offsite power availableresults in voltage dips on the 4.16kV and 480V buses which are unacceptablein consideration of the degraded grid protective relay settings due tocore spray pump motor acceleration time. Therefore, the licensee proposesa revised loading sequence for a safety injection signal with offsite poweravailable as follows: (1) Revise Table 3.2.B on page 67 to designate theinitiation setpoint for the A and C core spray pumps to be ``13 sec. +/-7%of setting'' and the initiation setpoint for the B and D core spray pumpsto be ``23 sec. +/-7% of setting''; (2) Revise Table 3.2.B on page 67 todesignate the initiation setpoint for the A and B LPCI pumps to be ``2sec. +/-7% of setting'' and the initiation setpoint for the C and D LPCIpumps to be ``8 sec. +/-7% of setting''; (3) Revise Table 3.2.B on page67 of the Unit 3 Technical Specifications only to delete the asterisk nextto the ADS Bypass Timer and the footnote which reads ``Effective when modificationassociation with this amendment is complete.'' In addition to the proposed ECCS loading sequence, the licensee will furtherimprove the voltage regulation of the 480V load centers during a motorstarting transient by a combination of plant modifications which revisethe load shedding or sequencing of the emergency service water pumps, theemergency cooling water pump, the RHR compartment coolers, the coolingtowers and the diesel generator vent supply fans. The licensee plans toperform these changes pursuant to 10 CFR 50.59 since none involves an unreviewedsafety question or a change to the Technical Specifications. The AppendixK (ECCS Evaluation Models) analysis was used to determine bounding allowablestarting times for the RHR and CS pumps. For change Request (1), the licenseeconcluded that the proposed increases in the core spray timer settingsare within the Appendix K analysis. Success of the core spray system requirestwo factors: (1) pump ready for rated flow and (2) injection valve opento permit full flow. There are two conditions required to support worstcase valve opening; reactor pressure is at the low end of its low pressurepermissive (400-500 psig) and power is available to the valve operator.Under the limiting scenario, the low pressure permissive occurs 47 secondsfollowing occurrence of the LOCA. Power to the injection valves is notinterrupted in this scenario and the valve stroke time is 12 seconds. Theearliest that the injection valve can be opened, therefore, is 59 seconds,and the pumps must be ready for full flow prior to this time. The seriesof events contribution to the establishment of the pumps ready for ratedflow are the sensor times for detection of the LOCA, the time for powerto be available at the emergency bus, the time for power to be availableto the pump motor and pump motor acceleration time. As stated previously,an assumption of the current Appendix K analysis of record is that thetime available to start and accelerate the CS pumps from the offsite sourcesis 59 seconds. Taking into account the above equipment operational timerequirements, the CS timer setting must be less than 47 seconds. Thus,the proposed 13 and 23 second timer settings are within the analyzed condition.For Change Request (2), the licensee has similarly concluded that the proposedincreases in RHR pump timer settings are in accordance with the AppendixK analysis. Success of the low pressure coolant injection (LPCI) mode ofthe RHR system requires three factors: (1) pump ready for rated flow, (2)injection valve open to permit full flow and (3) full closure of the recirculationdischarge valve. Under the limiting scenario, 57 seconds are availablefor the RHR pumps to start and accelerate to rated speed. The 57 secondsare derived from the time to reach the low pressure permissive to closethe reactor recirculation discharge valve plus the full stroke closuretime of the recirculation discharge valve. The series of events for theRHR pumps ready for rated flow are similar to the series of events forthe CS pumps. Taking into account the sensor and acceleration delays, theRHR timer setting must be less than 50.9 seconds. Thus, the proposed twoand eight second timer settings are within the analyzed condition. Neitherchange request involves additional loading onto the DC system. All replacementand additional relays resulting from these changes will be located in existingsafety-related panels. The control relays provided will equal or exceedthe ratings of the existing relays and meet the applicable design requirementsfor environmental and seismic qualification. Change Request (3) is proposed to the Unit 3 Technical Specifications onlyto delete a footnote which is no longer required since the modificationassociated with the ADS bypass timer (Modification 633) was completed forUnit 3 on February 24, 1986. Removing the footnote will eliminate the needto check the status of the modification to determine the applicabilityof the specification. The licensee proposes this administrative changeto enhance safety by reducing the effort required to interpret the specification.<T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92. A proposed amendmentto an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsiderations if operation of the facility in accordance with a proposedamendment would not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; (2) Create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;or (3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee has provided a discussion of the proposed changes as theyrelate to these standards; the discussion is presented below. <ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Standard 1 </T3>- The proposed Category A changes do not involve asignificant increase in the probability or consequences of an accidentpreviously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Category A changes are proposed to improve the protection providedby the undervoltage protective relays. The application of two undervoltagerelays per the proposed logic scheme represents a significant improvementin the level of protection provided to 480 volt MCC components under normal(non-LOCA) conditions. Although the proposed setpoint for the undervoltagerelay used for protection in the event of a LOCA is lower than the existingrelay setpoint, protection to the MCC components is actually improved dueto the improved operational tolerance of the proposed replacement relay.Increasing the setting on the ``LOCA'' time delay relay from 6 secondsto 9 seconds will ensure that he 4.16kV buses will not be spuriously transferredto the diesel generators in the event of a design basis accident with onlyone offsite power source available. These proposed changes do not affectthe probability or consequences of any accidents previously evaluated,but ensure that the 4.16kV buses will not be spuriously transferred tothe diesel generators thereby ensuring the validity of the existing accidentanalysis; specifically, a loss of coolant accident with off-site poweravailable. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Standard 2 </T3>- The proposed Category A changes do not create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previouslyevaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed changes to the relay settings do not involve a redistributionof loads on safety-related buses or affect the electrical separation orredundancy of any safety-related trains or components. The proposed changesimprove the undervoltage protective scheme and allow the 4.16kV buses tosustain a normal motor acceleration transient without a spurious transferto an alternate power source. The Category A changes do not alter the intentof the relays, and do not create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident from any previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Standard 3 </T3>- The proposed Category A changes do not result ina significant reduction in a margin of safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Category A changes are proposed to enhance safety. The proposedchange in undervoltage protection results in an improved protected voltagelevel to 480 volt MCC's and associated control components for both LOCAand non-LOCA conditions. The tolerance for the existing undervoltage relaysis 272% of setting. The tolerance for the proposed undervoltage relaysis 270.3% of setting. This results in an improved minimum protected levelfor non-LOCA conditions from 88.2% of rated voltage to 97.7% of rated voltage,and an improved minimum protected level for LOCA conditions from 88.2%of rated voltage to 88.7% of rated voltage. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The ``non-LOCA'' setpoint assures a limiting voltage value of 93%to 480 volt MCC's. An associated review of MCC contactor control circuitsand implementation of control circuit modifications as necessary will assure85% voltage to contactors. The ``LOCA'' undervoltage relay comes into effecton a LOCA signal, and the ``non-LOCA'' or normal protective setpoint isinhibited on the LOCA signal. The transition between the ``non-LOCA'' and``LOCA'' undervoltage relays in essence represents a continuity of protectionwith respect to the offsite power sources to the 4.16kV buses when theeffect of starting the 4kV ECCS motors on the 4.16kV buses is considered.Thus an improved continuity of protection against negative consequencesof degrading grid or failure of offsite power source equipment is assured.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Increasing the time delay settings allows pump motors to acceleratewithout an unnecessary transfer to an alternate power supply. The changesdo not involve a significant reduction in any margin of safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Standard 1 </T3>- The proposed Category B changes do not involve asignificant increase in the probability or consequences of any accidentpreviously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Category B changes are proposed to ensure the validity of theexisting accident analyses; specifically, a design basis LOCA with offsitepower available. Revising the timer settings for the RHR and CS pumps willimprove the voltage at the 480V levels during a motor acceleration transientand also prevents spurious transfer of the 4.16kV buses to the diesel generatorsin the event of a safety injection while operating with only one offsitepower source available. Therefore, the proposed changes do not increasethe probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Standard 2 </T3>- The proposed Category B changes do not create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previouslyevaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed changes to the CS and RHR systems only involve changesto load sequencing when offsite power is available. The proposed changesdo not involve the CS or RHR system piping configurations, pumps, valvesor system redundancies. The replacement timers required for the proposedload sequencing equal or exceed the ratings for the existing timers, anddo not affect the environmental or seismic qualification of the panelsin which they will be installed. Failure of any timer can only affect oneredundant train of equipment. Therefore, the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident is not created. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Standard 3 </T3>- The proposed Category B changes do not result ina significant reduction in a margin of safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed changes do not adversely affect the safety margin assumedin the 10 CFR Appendix K analysis for ensuring fuel integrity for the entirespectrum of postulated LOCAs. The limiting Appendix K scenario for corespray requires the CS pumps to be at rated flow 59 seconds after a LOCAto ensure the existing margin of safety. Under the proposed changes, thelatest that the CS pumps will achieve rated flow is 35 seconds (3 secondsfor detection of the LOCA plus 23 seconds for the longer of the CS timerdelays plus a maximum of 9 seconds for motor acceleration). The limitingAppendix K scenario for the low pressure coolant injection mode of residualheat removal requires the RHR pumps to be at rated flow 57 seconds aftera LOCA to ensure the existing margin of safety. Under the proposed changes,the latest that the RHR pumps will achieve rated flow is 14.1 seconds (3seconds for detection of the LOCA plus 8 seconds for the longer of theRHR timer delays plus 3.1 seconds for motor acceleration). Therefore, althoughthe Category B changes delay the availability of the CS and RHR pumps atrated flow, they do not result in a significant reduction in the marginof safety for core coolant delivery. </ITAG>The staff has reviewed the licensees' no significant hazards considerationfor Category A, items 1 and 2 and Category B, items 1 and 2 and agreeswith the licensees' analysis. Accordingly, the Commission has proposedto determine that the above changes do not involve a significant hazardsconsideration. The Category B, item 3, changes involving deletion of a now obsolete footnoteis proposed as an administrative change to improve the use of the TechnicalSpecifications. The Commission has provided guidance for the applicationof the criteria for no significant hazards consideration determinationby providing examples of amendments that are considered not likely to involvesignificant hazards considerations [51 FR 7751]. These examples include:Example (i) ``A purely administrative change to technical specifications:for example, a change to achieve consistency throughout the technical specifications,corrections of an error, or a change in nomenclature.'' The proposed change,to delete a footnote which refers to a now completed modification is anexample of such an administrative change since, now that the modificationhas been completed, the specification is in effect and the footnote isextraneous. Since this proposed change is encompassed by an example forwhich no significant hazard exists, the staff has made a proposed determinationthat it involves no significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Government Publications Section,State Library of Pennsylvania, Education Building, Commonwealth and WalnutStreets, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania 17126 <T3>Attorney for Licensee: </T3>Troy B.

A small increase in risk is associatedwith delaying the implementation of an LCO for 25 hours to allow completionof a missed surveillance. This risk is offset by a reduction in the possibilityof a plant upset and challenge to safety systems. The risk of plant upsetis greater if testing to complete a surveillance requirement is in progressat the time plant shutdown is commenced to comply with an LCO. It is preferableto allow time to complete the surveillance and demonstrate operabilityprior to changing plant status. The increase in safety gained from demonstratingoperability during the delay period balances out the risk associated withthe delay. In the case where inoperability is determined by testing duringthis extension, plant safety is enhanced if the affected equipment canbe restored to an operable status prior to changing the plant's operatingcondition. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Does the proposed license amendment create the possibility ofa new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Response: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed change, as analyzed, does not involve a new or differentkind of accident, from that previously evaluated.

Issuance of these amendments will allowthe removal of the RHR Autoclosure Interlock (ACI) circuitry. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>Both the industry and the NRC have recognized the safety benefitsof removing the Residual Heat Removal Autoclosure Interlock circuitry (RHRACI). The NRC-AEOD case study on long term decay heat removal, Case StudyReport AEOD/C503, Decay Heat Removal Problems at U.S. Pressurized WaterReactors, December 1985, recommended that consideration should be givento removal of the RHR ACI circuitry to minimize loss of decay heat removalevents. Also, a study performed for the NRC by Brookhaven National Laboratory,NUREG/CR-5015, Improved Reliability of Residual Heat Removal Capabilityin PWRs as Related to Resolution of Generic Issue 99, May 1988, listedseveral improvements to reduce the risk of loss of decay heat removal.One improvement was the removal of the RHR ACI circuitry. In parallel with the NRC activities, the Westinghouse Owners Group initiateda program to evaluate the removal of the RHR ACI circuitry on all Westinghousedesigned plants. The end product of this program was WCAP-11736, ResidualHeat Removal System Autoclosure Interlock Deletion Report for the WestinghouseOwners Group, Volumes 1 and 2, Revision 0.0, February 1988. WCAP-11736documents the probabilistic analysis performed on the removal of the RHRACI in terms of (1) the likelihood of an interfacing loss-of-coolant-accident(LOCA), (2) Residual Heat Removal system availability, and (3) low temperatureover-pressurization concerns. The results of the analysis show that (1)the frequency of an interfacing system LOCA decreases with the removalof the RHR ACI, (2) removal of the RHR ACI increases the RHR system availability,and (3) removal of the RHR ACI has no effect on heat input transients,but will result in a small, but not significant, increase in the frequencyof occurrence for some types of mass input transients with a decrease inothers. The net effect of RHR ACI deletion is an improvement in safety.To provide assurance that the Reactor Coolant system (RCS) will not bepressurized with the Residual Heat Removal system inlet valves open WCAP-11736requires that a safety grade alarm be added that will actuate in the controlroom given a ``VALVE NOT FULLY CLOSED'' signal in conjunction with a ``RCSPRESSURE-HIGH'' signal. The intent of this alarm is to alert the operatorthat the RCS/RHR series suction/isolation valve(s) is(are) not fully closed,and that double valve isolation from the Reactor Coolant system to theResidual Heat Removal system is not being maintained. WCAP-11736 furtherstates that applicable operating procedures should be modified to reflectthis new alarm and describe the appropriate response. The licensee hascommitted to adding the alarm and modifying the operating procedures beforeimplementing the requested technical specification change. The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists (10 CFR 50.92(c)). A proposed amendment toan operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards considerationif operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of anew or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

The deletion of the RHR ACI was analyzedin WCAP-11736 in terms of (1) the frequency of an interfacing LOCA, (2)the availability of the RHR system, and (3) the effect on overpressuretransients. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">With the removal of the ACI and addition of a control room alarm,the probabilistic risk analysis predicts a decrease in the frequency ofinterfacing LOCAs from 8.35E-07 to 5.77E-07/year, a decrease of approximately31%. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The availability of the RHR system was analyzed in three phases: initiation,short term cooling, and long term cooling. The probabilistic analysis indicatedthat deletion of the RHR ACI has no impact on the failure probability forRHR initiation. During short term cooling (72 hours after initiation),RHR ACI deletion decreased the RHR failure probability by 13%, from 1.60E-02to 1.40E-02. The long term cooling RHR failure probability was calculatedto decrease by 67% from 3.60E-02 to 1.20E-02. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Appendix D of WCAP-11736 presents the analysis used to determine theeffect of removal of the ACI on overpressurization transients. The analysiscategorizes the types of initiating events, determines their frequencyof occurrence, and then identifies the consequences of these occurrencesboth with and without the ACI feature. The result is a list of overpressureconsequence categories with associated failure probabilities (see Reference4 [WCAP-11736], Appendix D, Tables D-9, -10 and -11). For the charging/safetyinjection event, consequence frequencies increased on the order of 1.0E-10shutdown year. This is an insignificant increase as the overall consequencefrequency of the charging/safety injection event is 1.25E-01. Likewise,for the letdown isolation with RHR system operable case, one frequencycategory was increased on the order of 1.0E-11. Again this is insignificantwhen compared with the total frequency of these events of 1.25E-01. Forthe letdown isolation with RHR system isolated event, the overall consequencefrequency was reduced from 4.45E-01 to 2.22E-01. This occurs because manyspurious closures of the RHR isolation valves cause the isolation of letdown.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Removing the RHR ACI reduces the frequency of this event by approximately50%. It is concluded that the removal of the RHR ACI circuitry has an insignificantimpact on the frequency of overpressurization events at Salem Station.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accidentfrom any accident previously evaluated. The effect of an overpressure transientat cold shutdown conditions will not be altered by removal of the RHR ACIfunction. With or without the ACI function, the RHR system could be subjectto overpressure for which the RHR relief valves must be relied upon tolimit pressure to within RHR design parameters. While it is true that theACI initiates an automatic closure of the RHR suction/isolation valveson high RCS pressure, overpressure protection of the RHR system is providedby the RHR system relief valves and not by the slow acting suction/isolationvalves that isolate the RHR system from the RCS. This is reflected in theSalem UFSAR, which states: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Isolation of the RHR System is achieved with two remotely-operatedseries stop valves in the line from the RCS to the RHR pump suction andby two check valves in series in each line from the RHR pump dischargeto the RCS, plus a remotely-operated stop valve in each discharge line.Overpressure in the RHR System is relieved through a relief valve to thepressurizer relief tank in the RCS. (Reference 7) [Salem UFSAR Section5.5.7.2, page 5.5-28, Revision 7] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The purpose of the ACI feature is to ensure that there is a doublebarrier between the RHR system and RCS when the plant is at normal operatingconditions, i.e., pressurized and not in the RHR cooling mode. Thus theACI feature serves to preclude conditions that could lead to a LOCA outsideof containment due to operator error. The safety function of the ACI isnot to isolate the RHR system from the RCS when the RHR system is operatingin the decay heat removal mode. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">There are several methods to ensure that there is a double barrierbetween the RHR system and the RCS when the plant is at normal operatingconditions. First, plant operating procedures instruct the operators toisolate the RHR system during plant heatup. Second, an alarm that willbe installed as part of this change would annunciate in the control roomgiven a ``VALVE NOT FULLY CLOSED'' signal in conjunction with a ``RCS PRESSURE-HIGH''signal. This alarm would alert operators that either the RH1 or RH2 valveis not fully closed, and that double isolation has not been achieved. Inconjunction with this, operators will be trained using revised alarm responseprocedures to ensure they act to restore double isolation or return toa safe shutdown condition. Third, the open permissive interlock, whichis not being removed, will prevent the opening of the RH-1 and RH-2 wheneverthe RCS pressure is greater than the RHR system design pressure. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Since relief valves prevent overpressurization of the RHR system duringshutdown conditions and several methods are in place to ensure that theRHR system is isolated from the RCS during normal plant conditions, removalof the ACI does not create the possibility of a new or different kind ofaccident from any accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The RHRACI function is not a consideration in a margin of safety in the basisfor any Technical Specification. However, since the probabilistic analysisof WCAP-11736 indicates that the availability of the RHR system is increasedwith the removal of the ACI, overall safety has been increased. </ITAG>The staff has reviewed the licensee's submittal and significant hazardsanalysis and concurs with the licensee's determination that the proposedamendment does not involve a significant hazards consideration.

Rod droptimes are increased because of an increased dashpot effect caused by areduction in guide tube diameter. Proposed revisions 3 and 4 are being requested to incorporate new evaluationmethods for the effects of fuel rod bow on departure from nucleate boiling(DNB). The new methods provide a basis to eliminate unnecessary power distributionpenalties and to simplify the specification. Consistency between the Unit1 and 2 Technical Specifications is also achieved. Proposed revisions 5 and 6 are being requested to clearly define the DNBflow parameter limit plus uncertainties based upon the plants current configurations(previously licensed resistance temperature detector (RTD) flow uncertaintyreductions) and to achieve consistency between the Unit 1 and 2 TechnicalSpecifications.

WCAP-11579 demonstrates that the total uncertaintyassociated with the modified RCS narrow range temperature monitoring systemcould be reduced to a conservative value of 2.2% from existing value of3.5%. In addition to the 2.2%, an additional uncertainty of 0.1% for feedwaterventuri fouling will be added for a total uncertainty factor of 2.3%. Theevaluations provided show that the change to the allowable flow uncertaintydoes not result in a reduction to the margin of safety as identified inthe Final Safety Analysis Report.

This upgrade replaced the TerraTechnology (PRA-103S) seismic instruments with the EngDahl (PAR-400-2)seismic instruments. These new instruments were installed to improve instrumentefficiency and dependability. In addition to the manufacturer's recommendations,several administrative changes are also being made to these tables andto the Bases for Technical Specification, Section 3.2. Specifically, the channel calibration frequency for triaxial time historyaccelerographs and the triaxial peak accelerographs would be changed from``N/A'' to ``R'' (refueling). The channel functional test frequency forthe triaxial peal accelerographs would be changed from ``12 months'' to``N/A.'' The channel functional test frequency for the triaxial time historyaccelerographs and the biaxial seismic switches would be changed from ``sixmonths'' to ``SA'' (semi-annually). The channel calibration frequency forbiaxial seismic switches would be changed from once/operating cycle to``R''; i.e., each refueling cycle. The note which says ``except seismicswitches'' and is referenced by the channel check requirements for thetriaxial time history accelerographs and the biaxial seismic switches wouldbe deleted. The other administrative changes would provide a consistentorder to the tables, numbering the table entries for each type of instrument,and correcting the spelling of accelerograph. Also, in each table aftereach biaxial siesmic switch, the correct elevation (EL. 519) is added.<T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided Standards for determining whether a significanthazards determination exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). A proposed amendmentto an operating license involves no significant hazards considerationsif operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould not (1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated, or (2) Create the possibility of anew or different kind of accident previously evalauted or (3) Involve asignificant reduction in a margin of safety. The staff has reviewed thelicensee's no significant hazards determination analyses, provided to theCommission, in accordance with 10 CFR 50.91. The staff concurs with thelicensee's determination. However, the staff has determined that additionalclarification was needed and, therefore, the staff is providing the followingdetermination with these clarifications: 1. The replacement of the original seismic instruments with the EngDahlinstruments does not involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated. Regulatory Guide 1.12requires that seismic instrumentation be installed at nuclear power plantsso that, in the event of an earthquake, the seismic response of plant featuresimportant to safety can be determined promptly. This response is then comparedwith that used in the design basis in order to decide whether the plantcan continue to be operated safety. Although the monitoring instrumentationhardware is being changed, the intended monitoring functions and data providedby the EngDahl instruments are consistent with the appropriate RegulatoryGuide. The replacement of the seismic instruments will provide easier fieldcalibrations to be performed, greater reliability than the previous instruments,and therefore improve plant ability to monitor peak accelerations duringa seismic event. The replacement of these instruments support the currentdesign bases, noted regulatory requirements, and does not invalidate anysafety analysis assumed for the licensing and operation of BFN. The surveillance requirements in Table 4.2.J are being revised to incorporatethe vendor recommended testing frequencies. The revision to the ChannelCalibration testing frequencies for the triaxial history accelerographsand triaxial peak accelerographs to once per refueling outage is consistentwith the GE Standard Technical Specifications as well as Table 1, Frequencyof Maintenance, of ANSI/ANS-2.2-1978, ``Earthquake Instrumentation Criteriafor Nuclear Power Plants.'' The addition of these surveillances providesadded assurance that the subject equipment performs as designed. Deletingthe triaxial peak accelerograph Channel Functional Test and adding theChannel Calibration Test does not degrade the intent of the current TSsince the Channel Calibration test is a more comprehensive operabilityverification. The changes made to the surveillance testing frequencieswill still provide adequate verification that the instrumentation is performingits intended design function. The administrative changes being made are to correct typographical errorsexisting in the current Tables. The other administrative changes providegreater consistency between the two Tables, make the testing frequencynotations consistent with the existing definitions section, and provideelevations for the location of the seismic monitors. The changes discussed above do not affect the function or intended designbases for any safety-related equipment currently installed at BFN. Thereplacement instrumentation, amended surveillance testing, nor the administrativechanges do not change any of the safety analysis, assumptions made in theFinal Safety Analysis Report, or calculations used in the design or licensingbasis for BFN. 2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident from an accident previously evaluated. The replacementEngDahl seismic instruments provide the same type of data and are similarin size to the original instruments. The seismic instruments are mountedon specific pipes inside the plant. The size of the replacement instruments are similar enough that only minormounting bracket modifications were needed. The seismic qualification ofthe piping was not affected. Since this is a hardware modification, theintended function and parameters monitored will remain the same as theoriginal instruments. This amendment does not change the intended functionor operation of any safety-related equipment, emergency operating procedures,or operating procedures, or operating practices. Amending the surveillance frequencies as noted is in compliance with theappropriate industry standards and vendor recommendations. This amendmentdoes not change the intent of the existing TS and additionally ensuresthat, through the proper testing and calibration, the instrumentation isperforming its intended function. The proposed administrative changes provide consistency between the Tables.These changes do not affect any operational conditions, safety-relatedequipment, or setpoints which could cause or adversely affect the mitigationof a new or different kind of accident from an accident previously evaluated.3. The proposed changes do not significantly decrease the margin of safetyat BFN. The replacement of the seismic instruments is a hardware changeonly. The new instruments will provide added reliability and therefore,improve the plant's overall ability to monitor peak accelerations causedby a seismic event. The replacement instruments will perform the same functionas the original seismic instruments. Amending the surveillance frequencies as noted is consistent with currentindustry standards and practices. These changes are also consistent withthe vendor recommendations. The surveillances are to be utilized to ensureappropriate instrument function. The administrative changes are being made to provide consistency betweenthe Tables and correct typographical errors. These changes are administrativein nature and do not reduce any margin of safety. The seismic monitoring instrumentation is not required to mitigate theconsequences of any design basis events, but rather provide data for evaluationafter a seismic event to ensure that the plant can continue to operatesafely. Therefore, the proposed TS does not involve a significant reductionin the margin of safety. Therefore, the staff proposed to determine that the application for amendmentinvolve no significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Athens Public Library, SouthStreet, Athens, Alabama 35611. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>General Counsel, Tennessee Valley Authority,400 West Summit Hill Drive, E11 B33, Knoxville, Tennessee 37902. <T3>NRC Assistant Director: </T3>Suzanne Black <ITAG tagnum="84">Tennessee Valley Authority, Docket Nos. 50-327 and 50-328, SequoyahNuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2, Hamilton County, Tennessee </ITAG><T3>Date of amendment requests: </T3>December 22, 1988 (TS 88-34) <T3>Description of amendment requests: </T3>The Tennessee Valley Authority(TVA) proposes to modify the Sequoyah Nuclear Plant (SQN) Units 1 and 2Technical Specifications (TS). The changes are to remove inappropriatetesting requirements associated with the auxiliary building gas treatmentsystem (ABGTS). Surveillance requirements for ABGTS activation exist inSection 7, ``Plant Systems,'' and Section 9, ``Refueling Operations,''of the TS. These requirements are TS 4.7.8.d.2 and 4.9.12.d.2. The ABGTSsurveillance requirements from Section 7 are applicable during Modes 1,2, 3, and 4; and the ABGTS surveillance requirements from Section 9 areapplicable whenever irradiated fuel is in the spent fuel storage pool.The ABGTS test requirement associated with the auxiliary building ventilationmonitoring systems (ABVMS) would be deleted from both Sections 7 and 9.The ABGTS test requirement associated with a phase A containment isolationsignal would be deleted in Section 9 but would remain in Section 7. TheABGTS test requirement associated with the high radiation signal from thespent fuel pool monitors would be deleted in Section 7 but would remainin Section 9. A new requirement has been added to Table 4.3.9 of Specification 3.3.3.10,``Radioactive Gaseous Effluent Monitoring,'' to demonstrate automatic isolationof the auxiliary building ventilation exhaust any time the ABVMS (radiationmonitor) indicates measured levels above the alarm/trip setpoint. Thisrequirement is currently in Sections 7 and 9 as part of the ABGTS actuationtest for a high radiation signal from the ABVMS but would be deleted fromSections 7 and 9. Also, two typographical errors in the Unit 1 Specification3.3.3.10 have been corrected. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>TVA provided the following information on the ABGTS which is partof the auxiliary building ventilation system (ABVS) in its submittal onthe proposed TS changes. <ITAG tagnum="21">The ABVS is described in section 9.4.2 of the Final Safety AnalysisReport (FSAR. This system serves all areas of the auxiliary building includingthe radwaste areas and the fuel handling areas. It is designed to maintainacceptable environmental conditions for personnel access, for protectionof mechanical and electrical equipment and controls, and to limit the releaseof radioactivity to the environment. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The current ABGTS surveillance requirements impose appropriate actionsunder certain conditions. For example, should the single auxiliary buildingvent radiation monitor become inoperable, ABGTS must be declared inoperableand consequently a plant shutdown is required by Specification 3.0.3. Similareffluent monitoring technical specifications allow continued reactor operationwith vent path sampling. Similar inappropriate action applies to inoperabilityof the fuel pool monitors while in modes 1, 2, 3, and 4. An inoperablefuel pool radiation monitor, while in these modes, would require that ABGTSbe declared inoperable and could possibly result in a plant shutdown. Themore appropriate action is to limit crane operation with loads over thespent fuel pit as specified in Technical Specification 3.9.12. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Another inappropriate action would exist in Mode 6 with the PhaseA containment isolation signal becoming inoperable. Crane operation withloads over the spent fuel pit may be prohibited when, in fact, the lossof coolant accident (LOCA) mitigation equipment is not required. The proposedtechnical specification change will alleviate these problems by assigningeach ABGTS surveillance requirement to its proper accident signal. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Deletion of the ABGTS actuation surveillance requirement from thehigh radiation signal in the auxiliary building vent will significantlyreduce the amount of surveillance work, system alignment, and unnecessaryoperator interface required to perform the test. The current test addressesall aspects of the ABGTS function: ABGTS filter train start, auxiliarybuilding isolation, ABSCE [auxiliary building secondary containment enclosure]establishment, and accident mode room cooling. </ITAG>The Commission has provided Standards for determining whether a significanthazards determination exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). 10 CFR 50.91requires that at the time a licensee requests an amendment, it must provideto the Commission its analyses, using the standards in Section 50.92, onthe issue of no significant hazards consideration. Therefore, in accordancewith 10 CFR 50.91 and 10 CFR 50.92, the licensee has performed and providedthe following analysis: <ITAG tagnum="21">TVA has evaluated the proposed technical specification change andhas determined that it does not represent a significant hazards considerationbased on criteria established in 10 CFR 50.92(c). Operation of SQN in accordancewith the proposed amendment will not: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated. The ABGTS is an engineered safetyfeatures system required to function postaccident. The signal for ABGTSinitiation on high radiation in the auxiliary building vent is not includedin any accidents evaluated by the safety analysis report. Deletion of thesubject test requirement has no impact on the function of the ABGTS orthe radiation monitor itself. Deletion of [the surveillance requirementsassociated with] the phase A containment isolation signal and the fuelhandling area radiation monitor signal is consistent with assumptions madein the accident analysis. The typographical corrections are strictly administrativeand do not alter any intent of the specification. Therefore, there is nochange in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accidentfrom any previously analyzed. High radiation in the auxiliary buildingvent initiates an ABGTS start and isolation of the auxiliary building.For any accident where ABGTS is assumed, the start signal would be providedby redundant channels in the initiation logic, all of which are safety-grade,trained redundant instruments. The phase A signal and the fuel handlingarea signal are required operable as assumed in the FSAR. The typographicalcorrections are strictly administrative. Thus, the possibility of a newor different kind of accident has not been created. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. No changeis being made to the hardware or function of ABGTS or the auxiliary buildingvent monitor. The actual testing of the phase A signal and the fuel handlingarea signal is not changed. Because of the test signal being deleted isbacked up by redundant channels, which are safety-grade, trained, and thereforemore reliable, no margin of safety is reduced. The typographical correctionsare strictly administrative. </ITAG>The staff has reviewed the licensee's no significant hazards considerationdetermination and agrees with the licensee's analysis.

The Commission has determined foreach of these amendments that the application for the amendment complieswith the standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, asamended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations. The Commissionhas made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the Commission'srules and regulations in 10 CFR Chapter I, which are set forth in the licenseamendment. Because of exigent or emergency circumstances associated with the datethe amendment was needed, there was not time for the Commission to publish,for public comment before issuance, its usual 30-day Notice of Considerationof Issuance of Amendment and Proposed No Significant Hazards ConsiderationDetermination and Opportunity for a Hearing. For exigent circumstances,the Commission has either issued a <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice providing opportunity for public commentor has used local media to provide notice to the public in the area surroundinga licensee's facility of the licensee's application and of the Commission'sproposed determination of no significant hazards consideration. The Commissionhas provided a reasonable opportunity for the public to comment, usingits best efforts to make available to the public means of communicationfor the public to respond quickly, and in the case of telephone comments,the comments have been recorded or transcribed as appropriate and the licenseehas been informed of the public comments. In circumstances where failure to act in a timely way would have resulted,for example, in derating or shutdown of a nuclear power plant or in preventionof either resumption of operation or of increase in power output up tothe plant's licensed power level, the Commission may not have had an opportunityto provide for public comment on its no significant hazards determination.In such case, the license amendment has been issued without opportunityfor comment. If there has been some time for public comment but less than30 days, the Commission may provide an opportunity for public comment.If comments have been requested, it is so stated. In either event, theState has been consulted by telephone whenever possible. Under its regulations, the Commission may issue and make an amendment immediatelyeffective, notwithstanding the pendency before it of a request for a hearingfrom any person, in advance of the holding and completion of any requiredhearing, where it has determined that no significant hazards considerationis involved. The Commission has applied the standards of 10 CFR 50.92 and has made afinal determination that the amendment involves no significant hazardsconsideration. The basis for this determination is contained in the documentsrelated to this action. Accordingly, the amendments have been issued andmade effective as indicated. Unless otherwise indicated, the Commission has determined that these amendmentssatisfy the criteria for categorical exclusion in accordance with 10 CFR51.22. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(b), no environmental impactstatement or environmental assessment need be prepared for these amendments.If the Commission has prepared an environmental assessment under the specialcircumstances provision in 10 CFR 51.12(b) and has made a determinationbased on that assessment, it is so indicated. For further details with respect to the action see (1) the applicationfor amendment, (2) the amendment to Facility Operating License, and (3)the Commission's related letter, Safety Evaluation and/or EnvironmentalAssessment, as indicated. All of these items are available for public inspectionat the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,NW., Washington, DC, and at the local public document room for the particularfacility involved. A copy of items (2) and (3) may be obtained upon request addressed to theU.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Director,Division of Reactor Projects. The Commission is also offering an opportunity for a hearing with respectto the issuance of the amendments. By March 10, 1989, the licensee mayfile a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendmentto the subject facility operating license and any person whose interestmay be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as a partyin the proceeding must file a written petition for leave to intervene.Requests for a hearing and petitions for leave to intervene shall be filedin accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice for Domestic LicensingProceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. If a request for a hearing or petitionfor leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or anAtomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by theChairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on therequest and/or petition and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safetyand Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall setforth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceedingand how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding.The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention shouldbe permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) thenature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to theproceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial,or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of anyorder which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest.The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subjectmatter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Anyperson who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has beenadmitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave ofthe Board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfythe specificity requirements described above. Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to thepetition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions whichare sought to be litigated in the matter, and the bases for each contentionset forth with reasonable specificity.
