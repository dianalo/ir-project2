BoilerExplodes at New PlantIn Windsor, Quebec</HL><DD> 10/16/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> DTC </IN><DATELINE> MONTREAL  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Domtar Inc. said there was an explosion yesterday in a boiler at its new fine-paper plant in Windsor, Quebec.    The company said the explosion isn't expected to delay significantly the start-up of paper production later this year. While pulp production may be delayed, Domtar said it will be able to supply most of the pulp for the new paper machine from internal sources.    Domtar, a pulp, paper and building materials concern, previously estimated the construction cost of the new Windsor plant at 870 million Canadian dollars ($666 million).    The company said it hasn't determined the extent of the damage to the boiler. Two workers were injured in the explosion, but they returned to work later in the day. </TEXT></DOC>
