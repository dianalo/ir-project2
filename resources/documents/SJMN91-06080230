He had earlier pledged to boycottany such talks.;    Serbia is the largest and most populous of the sixrepublics and two semi-autonomous provinces of Yugoslavia, with Belgradeserving as both the national and Serbian capital.;    The country's collectivefederal presidency has denied Milosevic's bid to declare a nationwide state ofemergency.;    One of its members, Borisav Jovic, announced Friday that he wasstepping down. Three other presidency members followed suit or were withdrawn,leaving the fractious eight-member body without a quorum at a time ofunprecedented danger that ethnic and political quarrels would develop intocivil war.;    But Serbia's Parliament today refused to accept Jovic'sresignation. He accepted its decision, in effect withdrawing his resignation.;   Secession-minded Slovenia and Croatia are opposed by Serbia, which wantsYugoslavia to stay united. Jovic's further attendance at presidential meetingswas sure to result in continued bickering among the three republics, but themove also assured the body's formal ability to function.;    The parliamentwas to consider of whether Serbia's Interior Minister, Radmilo Bogdanovic, wasto blame for the March 9 crackdown. He was blamed by the demonstrators, whoalso called for his ouster.;    In addition, some opposition deputies havesaid they would demand the resignation of Milosevic and Premier DragutinZelenovic for their part in ordering police to disperse the peacefuldemonstrations.;    The crisis comes just three months after Milosevic and hisrenamed Communists, the Socialist Party, overwhelmingly won Serbia's firstfree elections in five decades.;    Opposition leaders say Milosevic might nothave won without government control of the media, which eased considerably dueto pressure from protesters who held a vigil in central Belgrade for five daysafter the crackdown.;    The army, ending several days of ominous silence,declared Tuesday that it would not permit Yugoslavia's battered federation todissolve in civil war. The statement appeared to lessen, but not totallyeliminate, the possibility that the army would take control.;    &quot;The Yugoslavarmy . . . shall not interfere in the political agreements about the future ofthe country,&quot; said the statement.;    But it added it would in nocircumstances permit &quot;inter-ethnic, inter-republic and inter-party bickering&quot;or &quot;a civil war in Yugoslavia.&quot;;    ...; Slovenia's government criticized thestatement saying the army, whose officer corps is dominated by Serbs, &quot;wasacting outside the current (Yugoslav) constitution.&quot;;    &quot;The army statementforeshadows the introduction of emergency measures which the presidencyrejected,&quot; said an announcement by the Ljubljana government.;    Yugoslavia'scrisis is focused on whether the country should remain a centralizedfederation, as advocated by Serbia and the Communist-dominated army, or aloose association as espoused by Slovenia and its neighbor Croatia.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Belgrade, Yugoslavia  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910320  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  668  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday March 20, 199100080230,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
