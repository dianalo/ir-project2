Most of the Bay Area didn'tfeel a thing, but the temblor shook the Santa Clara County EmergencyOperations Center to its very foundation.;   For 2 1/2 hours, 75 members ofthe county's emergency response team crammed into two tiny rooms in the centeratop &quot;communications hill&quot; in South San Jose, where they underwent a dressrehearsal for the real thing.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Local  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  QUAKE WAS FAKE -- ALSO REAL ENOUGH7.5 DRILL TESTS EMERGENCY TEAM RESPONSE  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Loma Prieta lessons refined; Only three months before the Loma Prietaquake, many had been here for a similar drill. Thursday was a chance to refinelessons that quake had taught.;   This shaker, modeled on what the U.S.Geological Survey expects might happen if the Earth buckles along one sectionof the San Andreas Fault, measured roughly five times the magnitude and 15times the intensity of Loma Prieta. Its epicenter was just south of SanFrancisco.;   In 42 seconds, the phantom quake left the response team with afinal exam of terrible proportions: Hospitals had collapsed, buildingstoppled, bridges crumbled, stretches of highways rippled like accordionbellows.;   In Santa Clara County alone, 163 people were dead and more than1,300 injured. Morgan Hill, Gilroy, Palo Alto and Santa Clara were hardesthit, accounting for 107 deaths. Eight-hundred homes were destroyed and morethan 6,500 damaged. The dollar loss: $2.5 billion.;   Worked by specialties;Grouped around long tables with red telephones according to their specialties,emergency team members dispatched rescue and fire units to collapsed andburning buildings, mobilized teams to deal with hazardous chemical spills,combed area agencies for blankets to deliver to shelters, coordinated theresponse of utility repair workers to gas leaks and electrical outages, sentteams of structural engineers to probe the safety of buildings, dispatchedtechnicians to check the potability of the county's drinking water, andquashed rumors of a typhoid fever outbreak.;   With all hospitals full andforced to assess new patients out of doors, officials used the dirigiblehangar at Moffett Field as a huge field hospital. When people started askingwhat they should do with the corpses, logistics chief Paul Sagers advised,&quot;Tell them to just cover them and leave them alone. We'll handle them whenwe're able to.&quot;;   For the most part, participants were satisfied with theirresponse to the emergency, in which &quot;simulators&quot; in an adjoining room testedthe team with messages for help of every imaginable kind.;   Prompt requestsfor help;   In fact, emergency personnel from the county's 15 cities assessedthe situation and asked for help so quickly that, had this been a realdisaster, the county might have gotten half of the 22 heavy-equipment rescueteams around the nation.;   &quot;They're a scarce resource,&quot; said Neal O'Haire, aparticipant from the state Office of Emergency Services. &quot;Whoever asks firstis going to get them because they're really only effective in the first 48hours.&quot; After that, people are seldom pulled from the rubble alive, he said.;  There were problems still to be solved. Even before Loma Prieta, officialssaid the size of the room in the county communications building wasinadequate. They're still looking for a facility closer to the civic center,said Earl Thompson, manager of county emergency services.;   During the LomaPrieta quake, he said, ham radio operators were invaluable in relayingmessages until telephone service was restored. Thursday's exercise assumedthat the center's phones would be out of commission for 5 1/2 hours after thequake. But ham operators are still working on hardware that will permit themto transmit paper copies of radio messages, so incorrect or distortedinformation doesn't get passed on.;   A first for county; Barbara Tryon, vicemayor of Los Altos Hills, an observer of the drill and a member of thecounty's Early Preparedness Council, said Santa Clara County was the first toprovide a communications link between the Emergency Operations Center and allof its cities, and is singled out throughout the state for its preparedness.;  In addition to representatives from most county departments and ham radiooperators, there were participants from Pacific Gas andamp; Electric Co., the RedCross, Pacific Bell, Santa Clara Valley Water District and the CaliforniaHighway Patrol.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  ED POPE, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910927  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  734  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday, September 27, 199100271210,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
