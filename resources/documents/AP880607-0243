The grants programs was given the name Erasmus (European ActionScheme for the Mobility of University Students) to recall the 16thcentury Dutch humanist who was one of the great figures of theRenaissance.   Since Fontainebleau, the Common Market has suffered manysetbacks, including debilitating battles over its budget and failureto find a way of reducing the region's high jobless rate of 10.4percent, which is nearly double the U.S. rate of 5.4 percent.   Its ambitious and costly plans for boosting the economiccompetitiveness of backward regions in Europe also have been largelydisappointing. About one-sixth of the total EEC budget is devoted tothese efforts.   Yet the EEC has scored many successes.   Some of the significant ones:   _Bringing Spain and Portugal into the organization Jan. 1, 1986.In political terms, this was aimed at strengthening democracy in twonations that only a decade or so earlier had shed dictatorships. Italso gave the EEC a combined population of 320 million, boosted itsride,callinghis historic candidacy a ``catalyst for growth.''   Republican George Bush, who has the GOP nomination in the bag,expressed eagerness to face Dukakis in the fall. He said the twohave many differences and ``I am ... on the right side.''   Dukakis said today there may well be ``a floor fight or two''with Jackson and his supporters at the Democratic NationalConvention next month, but he added, ``I don't see any greatdivisions within our party.''   He said the United States ``must go far beyond our currentsanctions'' against South Africa. But he stopped short of callingSouth Africa a terrorist nation, a label demanded of Dukakis and theparty by Jackson.   Dukakis said he and Jackson talked in general terms of Jackson'spost-primary role in the party during a meeting last night, but hewould not give details. He said the vice presidency was notdiscussed.   The four-month presidential primary season closed today withraces in California, New Jersey, New Mexico and Montana. All threepresidential contenders were in California today, and all werestaying in the state tonight to wait out the results of the day'scontests.   Early turnout was reported light in New Jersey and moderate inNew Mexico.   The biggest prize is California, and an ABC News tracking pollindicated Dukakis led Jackson in the state by a 2-1 margin, 61percent to 30 percent. The survey, based on 415 interviews Saturdayand Sunday, had a margin of error of 6 percentage points, thenetwork reported Monday night.   California officials were predicting a low turnout, however.Secretary of State March Fong Eu said she expected a turnout of 48percent, which would be the lowest in more than 40 years.   Before today's voting began, Dukakis had nearly 1,900 delegates,leaving him fewer than 200 shy of the 2,081 needed to nominate. OnMonday alone, more than 70 delegates flocked to the Dukakis camp.Jackson trails with less than 1,000 delegates.   There were 466 delegates at stake in today's primaries.   In addition, Dukakis' former rivals for the nomination werelining up behind him. Campaign sources said Dukakis would travel toMissouri on Wednesday, the day after the last primaries, to pick upRep. Richard Gephardt's endorsement. The same day, the sources said,Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois was to endorse the Massachusettsgovernor in Washington.   Dukakis' wife, Kitty, was following it all from her hospital bedin Boston, where she was recovering from spinal surgery. ``I thinkMichael will do well and I'm hoping by the eighth of June that hewill have sewn up the convention,'' she said.   Dukakis, not noted for his effusiveness, nonetheless sounded likea happy man as he headed into the final contests.   ``I'm really overwhelmed by the good feeling, the spirit, theconfidence. A sense of victory is in the air,'' he said as hecampaigned Monday in Los Angeles.   Jackson, however, suffered a primary-eve embarrassment when hemissed the first 16 minutes of a live half-hour statewide broadcastthat was supposed to showcase his campaign and provide a platformfor a dramatic final appeal.   The show's host, radio disc jockey Casey Kasem, was left toconduct an awkward interview with Jackson's state campaign chairmanand show repetitive video montages of the campaign. When Jacksonfinally arrived he appeared calm, but was perspiring profusely as heoutlined his positions.   Although Kasem had repeatedly referred to Jackson's latenessduring the first half of the broadcast, the candidate latercontended ``we really came in on time'' because Kasem filled the airtime. Jackson said he thought the broadcast went well.   Dukakis went to Jackson's Los Angeles hotel room for a late-nightmeeting Monday night. Neither man would comment to reporters afterthe hour-and-a-half meeting, and Dukakis walked tight-lipped througha crush of reporters in the lobby.   Jackson told The New York Times in an interview published todaythat he had ``earned the option'' to be offered the vicepresidential spot. He had said previously he deserved considerationfor the post.   In recent weeks, Jackson has been looking ahead to the conventionand pressing his platform demands. But he has also been looking backat the most successful presidential campaign ever waged by a blackcandidate. Jackson said his candidacy has helped build racialtolerance.   ``It's clear America has become more and more accustomed to JesseJackson as a possible next president,'' he said Monday. ``It's amatter of growth. I'm the stimulus. I'm the catalyst for thatgrowth.''   Bush, meanwhile, got a primary-eve boost of sorts from the Reaganadministration. Interior Secretary Donald Hodel announced Mondaynight that he was suspending plans for a controversial oil-drillingproject off the California coast.   Earlier this week, in what was then a step away from theadministration, the vice president called for a delay in theproject. The two Democrats oppose it outright, and Dukakis hadfaulted Bush for failing to do likewise.   Bush, speaking to a Republican audience on Monday, said he``can't wait for this primary season to end'' so he can gohead-to-head with Dukakis.   For Bush, the primary season has been over for some time. Heclinched the 1,139 delegates he needed for the GOP nomination backin April. But the Republican competition effectively ended threemonths ago, when the vice president racked up landslide wins acrossthe South.</TEXT></DOC>
