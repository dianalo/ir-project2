Bond prices fell slightly, andthe dollar moved higher as investors around the globe soughta safe haven.   The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 69.99 points, or2.4%, to 2898.03 in heavy trading. Broader measures of stockprices were off sharply, with Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stockindex plunging 9.11, also 2.4%, to 376.47. But small stockswere hardest hit. The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 14.83, or2.9%, to 497.64.</LP><TEXT>   Traders in New York had plenty of time to brace for thesell-off. News of the coup broke near midnight Sunday NewYork time, putting the Tokyo stock market squarely in thepath of knee-jerk panic selling. The Nikkei 225-Stock Indexplunged about 6% overnight. In Germany, where the threat of amilitarily resurgent Soviet Union looms largest, theFrankfurt stock market fell 9.4%.   By the time trading opened in New York the initial panicthat hit Tokyo and Frankfurt so hard had dissipated. Still,order imbalances kept market makers from opening trading insome of the 30 stocks that comprise the Dow Jones IndustrialAverage for nearly an hour after the opening bell. In thefirst hour the Dow industrials fell 107 points.   But after the initial hourlong plunge, stock prices beganregaining some of their lost ground, as selling pressureseased and some brave bargain hunters ventured into themarket.   Some stock-market strategists, such as Charles Clough atMerrill Lynch and Abby Cohen at Goldman Sachs, predicted theSoviet coup would have little long-term effects on the U.S.economy or the stock market. Both said the U.S. economy is inbetter shape to weather a shock than it was a year ago whenIraq invaded Kuwait, sending the stock market into atailspin.   &quot;It doesn't change our outlook, because it doesn't changeour expectations of a moderate economic recovery, moderateinflation and rising corporate earnings,&quot; said Ms. Cohen.   Traders also said the New York Stock Exchange'srestrictions on program trading held massive sell programs incheck yesterday. Such &quot;collars&quot; presumably won't come intoeffect again until the Dow industrials have fallen another 50points, something many traders expect today because ofprogram trading.   Joseph McAlinden, the market strategist at Dillon Read,was already looking for the stock market to slump by 10% orso in September or October. The Soviet coup &quot;merelytelescoped that price correction into the present,&quot; he said.But he added that if the Dow industrials fall as low as 2700,stocks will be cheap; he is looking for an economic recoverynext year that will carry the Dow as high as 3300.   Other investors also were cooler toward stocks before theSoviet Union crisis arose.   &quot;A lot of people were getting relatively cautious on themarket for a number of reasons&quot; including a feeble economicrecovery, the failure of prominent stock indexes such as theDow industrials to hit new highs and the scandal surroundingSalomon Brothers, said Mitchell Meisler, executive vicepresident at Shearson Lehman Brothers. &quot;My sense is that alot of traders on the street almost accidentally were in amuch better position than they would have been in otherwise.&quot;   In the bond and currency markets a &quot;flight to quality&quot;early in the day drove the dollar and bond prices sharplyhigher and sent interest rates spiraling down. Rates onsix-month T-bills at yesterday's regular weekly governmentauction dove to their lowest levels in five years. Yields onthree-month T-bills at one point fell below 5%. And yields onlong-term Treasury bonds sank below 8% to their lowest levelsin over a year and a half.   The dollar held most of its gains throughout the day. ButTreasury bond prices surrendered all their earlier gains andthen some. Bond holders &quot;started to look at potentialinflation concerns because of surging oil prices&quot; and becauseof fears that heavier U.S. defense spending in the wake ofthe Soviet coup could bloat the U.S. budget deficit evenfurther, said Stephen D. Slifer, executive vice president atLehman Brothers.   &quot;It's hard to imagine the U.S. Congress would be willingto go along with defense cuts in this kind of environment inthe Soviet Union,&quot; he said.   Analysts immediately began debating the longer-term impactof the coup on U.S. financial markets. &quot;The stock markets areoverreacting,&quot; said Mr. Clough of Merrill Lynch. &quot;We may seesome more intermediate choppiness, but we're still reasonablypositive on quality financial assets.&quot;   Stefan Abrams, chief market strategist at Kidder Peabody,said the uncertainty surrounding the Soviet Union won't beresolved soon. And as long as that uncertainty persists, hesaid, there is little chance that stock prices can go anyhigher. He said he expects the popular growth stocks thathave enjoyed high prices in recent years to be the principalvictims of any sell-off, since they're the most liquid stocksand also the ones on which profits can easily be taken.   In major market action:                                                                                                          Stock prices plunged in heavy trading. Volume on the NewYork Stock Exchange totaled 229.6 million shares. Decliningissues on the Big Board were ahead of advancers 1566 to 241.                                                                                                          Bond prices fell modestly. The Treasury's benchmark30-year bond lost about one-quarter point, or less than $2.50for each $1,000 face amount. The yield on the issue climbedto 8.11%.                                                                                                          The dollar soared. In late New York trading the currencywas quoted at 1.8245 marks and 138.12 yen, compared with1.7643 marks and 137.30 yen Friday.   ---   Robert Steiner contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
