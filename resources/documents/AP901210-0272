ATandamp;T said more than 50 major U.S. and international banks haveoffered commitments for the $6 billion credit line the phonecompany is establishing in its bid to buy the nation'sfifth-largest computer maker.   ATandamp;T said the credit line will back short-term notes the phonecompany plans to sell to finance part of the NCR bid. It also saidit may draw directly on the credit line for the funding.   ATandamp;T met with bankers Thursday on the tender offer, which itannounced Wednesday.   NCR has said it is not interested in being bought by anyone andthat it plans to fight the bid.   Also Monday, a federal judge in Baltimore dismissed a suit byATandamp;T that sought to halt NCR from pursuing tactics to block thetakeover.   U.S. District Judge Frederic N. Smalkin ruled that his courtdoes not have jurisdiction in the suit, filed Wednesday, becauseATandamp;T has not actually sought or obtained proxies from NCRstockholders.   NCR, a Maryland-chartered corporation, is based in Dayton, Ohio.On Friday, NCR filed suit in Columbus, Ohio, asking a federal judgeto declare valid a strengthened ``poison pill'' anti-takeover planendorsed by NCR's board of directors.   The existing poison pill would allow NCR to issue new stock toits shareholders at half the price if a company seeking a hostiletakeover acquired 20 percent of its stock. The strengthened planwould lower the threshold to 15 percent.   ATandamp;T was seeking consolidation of the Ohio and Maryland suitsand asking that NCR not be granted approval for its latestanti-takeover measure. ATandamp;T also asked that NCR not be allowed toresort to two state anti-takeover measures, the Maryland BusinessCombination Act and the Control Shares Act.   ATandamp;T's lawyers said in court Monday that the phone giant is``contemplating'' the use of proxies.   In a proxy fight, a potential acquiring company seeks to unseatthe board of directors of the target corporation.   Smalkin said ATandamp;T must first acquire enough NCR proxies toignite the takeover fight before he could consider legal action.</TEXT></DOC>
