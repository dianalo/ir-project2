The members of congressional banking panels accepting campaigncontributions from groups representing financial institutions vastlyoutnumbered those who rejected money from political actioncommittees, the Los Angeles Times reported today.   In their last election campaigns, legislators accepting PAC moneyoutnumbered those who refused it by 70 to 1, the newspaper reported.   Bank PACs contributed about $2.9 million, savings and loans gaveabout $680,000 and credit unions donated about $210,000, accordingto figures compiled for the Times.   Charles O. Zuver, who lobbies for the Credit Union NationalAssociation, said PAC contributions are aimed in part at gainingaccess to legislators.   ``If you do something for somebody, they'll usually rememberyou,'' he said.   President Bush's bailout proposal would increase federalinsurance premiums, substantially more for thrifts than banks, tohelp repay $90 billion to depositors at failed institutions.   The plan also calls for doubling the savings and loans' level ofcapital, which would take away an advantage they have over banks. Italso would require federal bank regulators to oversee the thrifts.   Senate banking committee members among the top 10 recipients ofPAC contributions from banks and savings and loans are: Donald W.Riegle Jr., D-Mich.; Terry Sanford, D-North Carolina; Jim Sasser,D-Tenn.; Jake Garn, R-Utah; and Alan Cranston, D-Calif., thenewspaper said.   Those on the top 10 list of recipients serving on the HouseBanking Committee include: Stephen L. Neal, D-North Carolina; JohnHiler, R-Ind.; Elizabeth Patterson, D-South Carolina; and David E.Price, D-North Carolina.   While Rep. Richard H. Lehman, D-Calif., a member of the HouseBanking Committee, said it would be naive to believe PAC moneywields no influence, he contended that critics exaggerate it.   Lehman received $20,400 from banks, savings and loans and creditunions for his 1988 campaign.   ``I don't think it (PAC money) will have any impact at all,''said Riegle, Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committeechairman. He accepted $183,000 from PACs during his re-electioncampaign.   Federal Election Commission records show the new chairman of theHouse Banking Committee, Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, received$5,500 from bank PACs in his re-election campaign last year. He alsoreceived $1,500 from savings and loans and $1,200 from credit unions.   Gonzalez, in a letter to the San Antonio Express-News, professeddisdain for PAC money, saying ``no PAC money from banks has evercome to me.''   Aides declined to make Gonzalez available for comment, the Timessaid.</TEXT></DOC>
