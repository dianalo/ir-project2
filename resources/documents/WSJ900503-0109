Smith,whose retirement pay would nearly double to about $1.2million a year under the plan.   The move is drawing fire from the United Auto Workersunion, which may make sweeter pensions an issue in thissummer's national contract talks with GM and the otherdomestic auto makers.</LP><TEXT>   The new pension formula, outlined in GM's proxy statementissued last month, is being submitted to shareholders forapproval at the company's May 25 annual meeting. The newformula would apply to GM's U.S. executives who retire afterNov. 1, 1989. That includes Mr. Smith, who will retire Aug.1.   The formula would be sweetened by including salary andbonuses in calculating each executive's pension. Currently,the formula reflects only an executive's base salary. Thechange would be especially lucrative for top executives suchas Chairman Smith, for whom bonus is an important part oftotal direct compensation.   GM contends that its executive pensions aren'tcompetitive, and that the change would merely bring itspension formula up to prevailing standards.   The proposed change &quot;is consistent with what a number ofother large companies do,&quot; said a spokesman. &quot;GM had beenbehind other companies in this area.&quot; He added that GMdoesn't have to submit the change to shareholders, but thecompany's directors had decided to do so.   Despite GM's arguments, the timing of the proposed changeis sure to complicate the company's contract talks with theUAW. A sizable portion of the union's rank and file wants tomake inflation-indexing for pensions a key contract demand.The union's leadership believes the demand isn't realisticand would prefer to focus on job-security issues, but GM'smove may bring the pension issue to the fore.   &quot;Later this year we will be bargaining for hundreds ofthousands of retired union workers,&quot; UAW President OwenBieber said in a statement yesterday. &quot;In view of GM'slargesse to its executives, there will be no excuse for thecorporation to be less than fully responsive to the needs ofour older members and retirees.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
