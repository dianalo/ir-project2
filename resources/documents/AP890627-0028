Attorney Edgar Neely III told U.S. District Judge G. ErnestTidwell on Monday that Georgia law allows only a custodial parentthe right to sue on a matter concerning a child. Neely said Lena JanParsons' parents have divorced during the past year and her father,John Parsons, was granted custody.   The attorney also argued that the mother, Lena Arlene Wilson, hassuffered no direct harm from the tape, which has been copied, widelycirculated and shown in edited form on television.   Tidwell did not indicate when he would rule on the motion todismiss the lawsuit.   The lawsuit filed last month accused Lowe of seducing thethen-16-year-old Miss Parsons during the 1988 Democratic NationalConvention in Atlanta. The lawsuit says Lowe inflicted emotionalharm on the mother and seeks unspecified damages.   Mrs. Wilson's attorney, Hue Henry, said Miss Parsons was livingwith her mother at the time the videotape was made, and that thetape has caused direct harm by humiliating the family and strainingthe parent-daughter relationship.   Lowe, the 25-year-old star of such films as ``St. Elmo's Fire''and ``About Last Night,'' did not attend the hearing.</TEXT></DOC>
