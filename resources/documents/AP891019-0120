Robert McLaughlin, 30, was awarded $1.5 million Wednesday for``loss of liberty, mental stress, anguish and loss of reputation,''by Judge Adolph Orlando, settling a lawsuit that was filed threeyears ago.   Orlando also ordered the state to pay the former Brooklynresident $225,000 in medical expenses, noting that his prisonexperience had contributed to a dependency on drugs and alcoholthat required hospital treatment.   With amounts awarded for lost of past and future earnings, thetotal award was $1,935,000, a record in New York for damages in acase of unlawful conviction, said civil rights lawyer RichardEmery, who represented McLaughlin.   McLaughlin had sought $20 million.   McLaughlin was convicted in 1979 and sentenced to 15 years fortaking part in an armed robbery of 15 people, one of whom waskilled for resisting.   The conviction was overturned in 1986 after his foster father,Jarold Hohne, persuaded Emery and a police lieutenant to get thecourt to reinvestigate the case. The only witness who identifiedMcLaughlin from photographs later acknowledged he was wrong.   Orlando praised Hohne, saying he ``sought any availableinformation, left no stone unturned to prove his son's innocence.''   McLaughlin now works in St. Paul, Minn., as a painter.</TEXT></DOC>
