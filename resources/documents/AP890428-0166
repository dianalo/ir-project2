Grienko, suggested Friday that Georgiandemonstrators were responsible for violence that cost lives at apro-independence protest on April 9.   Grienko told Soviet journalists that troops try not to use forceto break up demonstrations, but the protest in the Georgiancapital, Tbilisi, was not peaceful.   At least 19 people were killed when troops wielding shovels andclubs, firing gas and riding armored personnel carriers and tanksmoved in on the demonstration outside Government House in downtownTbilisi. At least one more person was shot and killed later forviolating a curfew.   Georgian activists contend the troops brutally moved in withoutwarning and attacked peaceful demonstrators.   Grienko said ministry troops display ``the highestprofessionalism, so there won't be victims from any of our actions.... But that doesn't depend on us, because two sides are acting.''   He said the soldiers try to obey the law, respect people and befair, but ``unfortunately, they don't always manage to do this''because of opposing forces.   Grienko's remarks were broadcast on Soviet television's eveningnews broadcast ``Vremya.''   Also on the program, deputy Soviet prosecutor Alexander F.Katusev said four Georgian activists arrested shortly after thedemonstration were charged with being ``organizers of, and activeparticipants in group actions violating public order.''   Katusev said military prosecutors are investigating whether useof gases to put down the demonstration was proper, and what the 19protesters died of. Most of those killed were women.   Soviet officials acknowledged that soldiers used tear gas.Members of a citizen's commission investigating the confrontationand doctors treating victims say a second gas that paralyzes thecentral nervous system was used. Georgia's Communist Party chief,Givi Gumbaridze, said some victims died of gas poisoning.</TEXT></DOC>
