Boone Pickens Jr. proposed to buy the Newmont Mining Corp. shares it doesn't already own for $95 each, or $5.68 billion.    In a letter to Gordon R. Parker, chairman of the New York-based mining concern, Mr. Pickens proposed to acquire Newmont's stock in a &quot;negotiated transaction.&quot; Mr. Pickens also offered to allow Consolidated Gold Fields PLC, the London-based gold concern that holds 26.2% of Newmont, continued ownership in the company.    The proposal by the Pickens-led group, Ivanhoe Partners, sent Newmont's stock soaring. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Newmont closed at $92 a share, up $9.50. About 3.2 million Newmont shares changed hands, more than 12 times the company's average trading volume.    Although Ivanhoe doesn't yet have financing for the proposed offer and many analysts expect Newmont to reject it, Wall Street traders saw the proposal as a credible one. Many had expected Ivanhoe to propose to buy Newmont since last month, when Ivanhoe first disclosed it held a stake in the concern.    The Pickens group's proposal was viewed on Wall Street as a &quot;bear hug&quot; because, while couched in friendly terms, it was certain to be perceived by Newmont as a threat.    Newmont officials declined to comment on the bid.    If the proposal is rejected or ignored, the Ivanhoe letter is likely to be followed soon by a hostile cash tender offer for Newmont, and possibly by an attempt by Ivanhoe to replace Newmont's board, according to individuals familiar with Ivanhoe's strategy.    In the letter to Mr. Parker, Mr. Pickens, general partner of Amarillo, Texas-based Mesa Limited Partnership, said Ivanhoe is &quot;highly confident that financing can be obtained on a timely basis.&quot; Mesa officials weren't available for comment.    In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing yesterday, Ivanhoe disclosed that it had hired Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. on Sunday to help arrange financing for an offer. The partnership also said it hired Carter Organization Inc., a New York-based proxy solicitation concern.    Newmont is Mr. Pickens's kind of company. It is a natural resource concern with little debt and a stock price that has, until recently, traded significantly below its asset values.    Newmont has interests in gold, coal, and oil and gas. It also owns more than $1 billion of marketable securities that include a 90% stake in its Newmont Gold Co. subsidiary and a 2.4% stake in Du Pont Co.    Ivanhoe owns about 6.7 million Newmont shares, or 9.95% of the company's 66 million shares outstanding. Those shares were bought at an average cost of about $64.25 a share, indicating a total investment of $427.3 million.    Besides Mesa, which owns 45% of the partnership, Ivanhoe also includes John Harbert III, a Birmingham, Ala., businessman; Dallas-based NRM Energy Co.; and Galactic Resources Ltd., a Vancouver, British Columbia-based gold exploration and mining concern.    A major unanswered question is the response to Ivanhoe's proposal by Newmont's largest shareholder, Gold Fields, which is controlled by South African mining magnate Harry Oppenheimer. Gold Fields so far has reacted coldly to Ivanhoe's interest and has said it backs Newmont's management.    In an apparent attempt to assuage the big shareholder, Mr. Pickens offered in the letter to discuss with Gold Fields &quot;a broad range of alternatives&quot; to the British company's sale of its interest.    But if Gold Fields itself decides to buy more Newmont shares or to sell properties in exchange for Newmont stock or cash, an acquisition by the partnership could be more costly and the mining company's stock could plummet.    Newmont &quot;could play hardball and make things miserable for all holders,&quot; one trader said. As previously reported, the Ivanhoe investment voided a standstill agreement between Newmont and Gold Fields, allowing Gold Fields to greatly increase its Newmont stake; so far, Gold Fields hasn't chosen to do so.    In London, a Gold Fields spokesman said it was &quot;too soon to comment&quot; on the bid. Yesterday was a public holiday in Britain and Gold Fields directors weren't in their offices.    Some analysts expressed skepticism that the group will be able to acquire the company. Instead, they said, the bid is more likely to force Newmont to restructure, or to lead to an additional investment in Newmont by Gold Fields.    Some Wall Street executives said Newmont could spurn the Ivanhoe proposal on the ground that the partnership hasn't obtained financing. &quot;What does a letter saying that Boone is confident really mean?&quot; said one mergers specialist, adding, &quot;Nothing.&quot;    Ivanhoe didn't provide any details in the letter or the filing of how the proposed bid would be financed. But an individual familiar with Ivanhoe's Newmont activities said that certain of the Ivanhoe partners, including Mesa and Mr. Harbert, have agreed to make additional equity contributions to the partnership. Ivanhoe's banks also have agreed to lend additional money, the individual said. It couldn't immediately be learned who the partnership's banks are.    Ivanhoe also disclosed in the filing that it had paid Drexel Burnham $500,000 to assist in obtaining financing. Ivanhoe will pay the New York-based investment banking firm another $1.5 million once Drexel Burnham delivers a letter indicating it is confident it can finance the bid, most likely through the sale of high-yield, high-risk &quot;junk&quot; bonds.    Some analysts speculated that if Ivanhoe does make a hostile bid, Newmont may look to Gold Fields as its friendly suitor, with the British company countering with an offer that could run as high as $105 a share. Newmont also could distribute to its shareholders its 90% stake in its Newmont Gold unit, a move that could reduce the value of Newmont shares by at least $40 a share, said William Siedenburg, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co.    One thing Newmont may not want to do is offer to buy back its own shares, because the price it would have to pay could put it in an embarrassing position. The company sold four million common shares to the public in mid-June for $45 each.    Indeed, in the letter to Newmont's Mr. Parker, Mr. Pickens referred to that offering. He wrote that Ivanhoe's proposed $95-a-share proposal &quot;represents a significant premium to recent market prices and more than 200% of the price at which Newmont sold its own shares to the public only two months ago.&quot;    Ivanhoe said it would offer Newmont's management &quot;meaningful equity ownership in the company,&quot; which one individual said could be as high as 15%.    Still, even if Newmont or Gold Fields succeed in blocking Ivanhoe from acquiring the company, Mr. Pickens may instead hope to make a hefty profit to help Mesa pay its $2-a-unit cash distribution without borrowing or dipping into cash reserves.    The partnership so far has made a $184.5 million paper profit. Mesa's share of the profit is 49% of that total and would more than compensate for its cash-flow shortfall this year. Through its ownership of a special issue of NRM Energy preferred stock, Mesa also stands to benefit from any profit NRM makes on the investment.    ---   Allanna Sullivan contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
