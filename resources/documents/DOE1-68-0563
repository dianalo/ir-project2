Over the past several years, the ANSstudent branch at Texas A andamp; M University has toured the constructionsite of the South Texas Nuclear Project (STNP), which is jointly ownedby the Houston Lighting andamp; Power Company (HL andamp; P), the City of San Antonio,the Central Power andamp; Light Company, and the City of Austin. This year,student branch organizers recognized that another aspect of a commercialnuclear power plant was not being covered either in the academic coursework or the plant tours. This facet includes the organization and managementrequired to undertake a major nuclear power project. To fill this gap,HL andamp; P sponsored a one-day seminar that covered the various managerialfunctions for STNP. The seminar on the Organization and Management ata Commercial Nuclear Power Project was very interesting and beneficial.Other ANS branches and utilities may find this to be a useful model forfuture activities.</TEXT></DOC>
