(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Protesters hoping to block plans for anarchaeological dig at two Indian mounds kneeled around a colorfulIndian prayer blanket and called on the Great Spirit for help.   ``This is a spiritual issue. These grounds are sacred to NativeAmericans,'' said Harry Moore, regional director of the NationalConference of Christians and Jews.   Moore accompanied three Protestant preachers and an Indianspiritual leader Wednesday as they joined a dozen other critics ofthe proposed dig. The mounds are all that remain of an Indianvillage that sat beside the Mississippi River about a thousandyears ago.   Protests led by several American Indians who said the graves oftheir ancestors would be violated stopped a dig scheduled at thesite in June by a Memphis State professor and his students.   Now, state officials are considering a dig at the mounds, butstate archaeologist Nick Fielder said the protesters don'tunderstand what he's up to.   ``Archaeologists are interested in seeing such sites preserved.We don't have to be at odds,'' Fielder said.   The state is trying to have the mounds registered as a nationalhistoric site, he said, and digs will be conducted only if requiredas part of that application.   The mounds are not believed to contain graves, but if any arefound, they will be left alone, Fielder said.   However, protesters said the site is sacred to American Indiansand should not be disturbed for any reason.   ``Freedom of religion is as dear to these people as it is to meas a Baptist,'' said the Rev. W.C. Holmes, pastor of Beulah BaptistChurch.   Holmes, the other pastors and Moore joined with RosemarieAbeita, an Indian spiritual leader from New Mexico, in the prayerbeside the mounds. The group kneeled before an altar made of woodcarvings, eagle feathers and other religious items.   ``Make of us one people and help us recognize our common home ofthis Earth,'' said the Rev. Nancy Hastings Sehested, pastor ofPrescott Memorial Baptist Church.   After their prayer, the demonstrators held hands in a circle,sang ``We Shall Overcome'' and recited the Lord's Prayer.   Ms. Abeita said the mounds already have been disturbed too muchover the years. They were used for fortifications during the CivilWar, and 27 skeletons were dug up and removed from the mounds inthe 1930s, she said.   Fielder said the skeletons were uncovered by a work crewbuilding a road, not by archaeologists. Placing the mounds on theNational Register of Historic Places would prevent that sort ofthing from happening again, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
