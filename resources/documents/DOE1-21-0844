The seminar wasdesigned to keep the mineral industry informed of new technology developedby the Bureau of Mines that permits reliable and accurate predictionof mine subsidence. The papers describe actual field studies undertakenby the Bureau to monitor surface subsidence over longwall panels. Topicsdiscussed include the effects of subsidence on water table levels, thedevelopment of subsidence precalculation methodology suitable for usewith the specific lithological conditions of the Pittsburgh coalbed,an engineering comparison of technologies used in surveying for longwallmine subsidence, and a comparison of the process of subsidence over twodifferent longwall panels.</TEXT></DOC>
