Funeral homes are bearing an unfair burden, said Ivana Flynn,administrator at Crippen and Flynn Funeral Home in Redwood City.   ``It should be against the law,'' she said. ``Human bodies beingstuck somewhere, waiting to be buried. I don't think that's right.''   Garden Chapel in South San Francisco is using a garage as atemporary holding place for eight bodies awaiting burial.   Richard Noftsger, the funeral home's manager, said the mortuaryis embalming all bodies that will not be immediately buried, evenif the family did not desire it.   While mortuary workers said the biggest inconvenience would befor families waiting to bury their loved ones, one mortuaryofficial said she believed leaving bodies unburied was a serioushealth hazard.   ``Especially in the summertime. Our refrigeration unit only canfit one or two,'' said Ivana Flynn, administrator of Crippen andFlynn Funeral Home in Redwood City.   Mortuaries are using special embalming methods to preserve thebodies for an extended period, Dessem said.   The walkout centers on claims by the workers' union that undercurrent provisions, cemeteries can hire subcontractors for workusually performed by union employees.   About 150 union members responsible for burials, gardening andgeneral maintenance at 17 cemeteries walked off the job May 30, twodays after contract talks broke down. The three-year contractexpired in March.   Talks were scheduled through the weekend, but picketers saidthey would stay ``a whole year'' outside the cemetery gates if theyhave to.   At Holy Cross Cemetery in Colma, management said they werehandling most of the routine grounds maintenance, such as mowinggrass. Managers at most of the other cemeteries declined to discusshow they've been coping with the strike. Last week, members of theCemetery Workers and Greens Attendant Union Local 265 met with theEast Bay Interment Properties Association. Those talks ended June11 and the union is now negotiating a separate contract withanother cemetery association, Associated Cemeteries, owners said.   The East Bay Interment group includes cemeteries in Oakland,Berkeley and El Cerrito. Associated Cemeteries representscemeteries primarily in Colma.   During a 1985 strike by cemetery workers in the Bay Area, about800 bodies went unburied.</TEXT></DOC>
