The doctrines in Sun Tzu's &quot;The Art of War&quot;may go against the John Wayne history of Marines in World WarII, but John Wayne history is to history what military musicis to music.   The Marine attacks at Guadalcanal and Tarawa were designedto cut off the main Japanese force by moving swiftly andpowerfully behind the main force. The Marines applied thesame tactics in invading at Inchon in Korea. TraditionalMarine doctrine is to apply overwhelming force at crucialstrategic points. The idea of sending forces slogging intoheaps of dead is a traditional U.S. Army doctrine pioneeredby Gen. William Sherman during the Civil War.</LP><TEXT>   The belief that Marine Corps glory is willingness to diein battle is nonsense. The very essence of the Marinetradition is concentrated power at crucial points. We wereindoctrinated with an old saying during Marine training:&quot;Your goal is not to die for your country, your goal is tomake the other guy die for his country.&quot;   Michael T. Martin   Phoenix, Ariz.   ---   Marines studied and applied the teachings of Sun Tzu longbefore the 1970s. When I entered the Marine Corps in 1952,and while preparing to go to Korea in 1953 to fight hisdescendants, Sun Tzu was a staple in our training.   Later, at Marine Corps Schools in Quantico during the1960s, we studied and learned his theories again, forapplication, where appropriate, in Vietnam.   The late Brig. Gen. Sam Griffith, USMC, translated SunTzu's works prior to 1963. Gen. Griffith, and others, hadapplied Sun Tzu's tactics during World War II.   Marines study other military theorists, especially Karlvon Clausewitz, who wrote that as there are no prescriptionsfor victory, an army should use the tactics and strategiesmost appropriate to the situation and in accord with thepolitical objective.
