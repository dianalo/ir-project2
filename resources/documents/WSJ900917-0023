But judging from recent experience, that may be a pipedream.</LP><TEXT>   Baghdad already has the facilities to continue producingmassive quantities of its own biological and chemicalweapons, and it has sophisticated missiles to deliver them,experts say. More worrisome, the nuclear nonproliferationtreaty can't significantly restrict Saddam Hussein's questfor nuclear weapons: under the treaty, which Iraq has signed,he can continue Iraq's nuclear research effort.   These stark realities fuel the debate over whether theU.S. can achieve its goals in the Persian Gulf unless ittopples Saddam Hussein.   So far, the Bush administration hasn't reached its ownconclusion. In his address to a joint session of Congresslast week, the president said only that one long-term U.S.objective in the Persian Gulf would be &quot;to curb theproliferation of chemical, biological, ballistic missilesand, above all, nuclear technologies.&quot;   Lately, the administration seems to be hoping it canachieve its goal short of eliminating the Iraqi dictator. Butmany experts say containment won't work. They note that withinternational help, Iraq has built a nearly self-sufficientdefense industry. West German companies built itschemical-weapons facilities. French companies helped itconstruct an electronics plant that makes computer chips andcircuit boards used in air-defense equipment. A Chileancompany designed an Iraqi factory that makes cluster bombs.   Similarly, Iraq has sophisticated missile technology. InDecember, it surprised U.S. and other intelligence servicesby launching a rocket capable of putting a satellite inorbit. And according to a report last week, Iraq successfullytested an intermediate-range ballistic missile loaded withchemical weapons.   &quot;All of our experience over the last decade suggests yousimply cannot effectively control the ability of a country toobtain technology if they really want to get it,&quot; says W.Seth Carus, research fellow at the Washington Institute forNear East Policy, a private group.   The U.S. itself lacks the means to block the flow ofmilitarily sensitive technology to regional powers. Undercurrent rules, the Pentagon only has the authority to monitorcertain potentially troublesome exports to communist nations.But now that the communist bloc has dissolved, it is nationssuch as Iraq that pose the greatest threat. Last week, theSenate passed a measure giving the Pentagon more authority,but the measure must be reconciled with a House bill.   Concerning nuclear facilities, Leonard Spector, an experton nuclear proliferation issues at the Carnegie Endowment forInternational Peace, says the current treaty isn't enough tosafeguard the world against a maverick like Saddam Hussein.   Non-nuclear countries that have signed the treaty, such asIraq, pledge not to develop nuclear weapons. But the treatyallows them to do nuclear work that ostensibly is forpeaceful purposes. So, Saddam Hussein could continue hisnuclear research program without violating the treaty untilhe is just weeks from being able to produce a bomb.   Mr. Spector says the U.S. prefers additional agreements,such as one it has with South Korea, that say certain kindsof nuclear facilities -- such as enrichment plants or largeresearch reactors -- won't be built even though permitted bythe treaty.   Last week, Secretary of State James Baker seemed to besuggesting similar arrangements could be applied in theMiddle East. He told North Atlantic Treaty Organizationallies that the major powers and Mideast nations &quot;need toconsider intrusive, internationally sanctioned measures andprocedures to diminish the threat of Iraqi weapons of massdestruction.&quot;   But how could &quot;intrusive&quot; measures be peacefully used onSaddam Hussein? &quot;It seems to me that if Saddam Husseinwithdraws from Kuwait, we're going to be stuck with asituation where we would wish for more than the treaty, butwon't be able to get it,&quot; says Mr. Spector.   As a result, some experts are concluding reluctantly thatthere is only one way to deal effectively with Iraq's nuclearcapabilities. &quot;Given their record on important treaties, wecannot be sure that their word means they will honor theirobligations,&quot; says congressional aide Peter Galbraith, aMideast expert. &quot;The only way we can be sure is if theirnuclear facilities are either dismantled or destroyed.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
