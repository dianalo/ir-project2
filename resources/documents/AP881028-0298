OSHA said Morrell knew as early as 1984 that working conditionsat the plant were causing ``serious and sometimes disablingcumulative trauma injuries'' but did nothing to change thoseconditions.   The company's own injury and illness records showed that 880 of2,000 employees at the plant sustained such injuries, caused by longperiods of repetitive motion, from ay 1987, to April 1988, thegovernment said.   ``This case involves an employer who knew about a serious healthhazard, saw the tragic toll on its workers and chose to ignore it,''said Assistant Labor Secretary John A. Pendergrass.   OSHA officials said ergonomics specialists from the NationalInstitute for Occupational Safety and Health found during aninspection begun six months ago that 722 employees were beingexposed daily to a significant risk of cumulative trauma disordersfrom repeated hand, wrist and arm motions. The most common form ofthe affliction, officials said, is carpal tunnel syndrome.   Pendergrass said the incidence of cumulative trauma disordersamong workers at the Sioux Falls plant was nine times greater thanthe meatpacking industry average of 4.8 per 100 full-time workersper year and 600 times the rate for all U.S. industries.   Morrell said in a statement that it considered the fine ``grosslyunfair and totally unjustified.'' The company hinted that it mighttake the matter to court.   Pendergrass said that many of the disorders could have beeneasily prevented.   ``The design of knives, for instance, can reduce trauma,''Pendergrass said, adding that the biggest improvement needed was achange in the ``attitudes of management.''   Under the law, Morrell has 15 days to pay the fine or appeal itto a Labor Department review board.   In its statement, Morrell said it was considering seeking aninjunction ``to stop OSHA from singling us out for penalties andimposition of arbitrary standards for what is clearly a national,multi-industry safety and health problem.''   Morrell also said that its on-the-job safety record had improveddramatically this year.   Morrell said injuries needing to be reported to OSHA, expressedas injuries per 1,000 full-time workers, had fallen from 70.5 inJanuary to 16.75 in October.   The company's statement also maintained that ``the simplest andmost reliable method'' of avoiding excessive repetitive motions''was varying workers' daily routines. But, the meatpacker said,``union work rules and the grievance process have often been used toblock'' such changes.   The $4.33 million fine was arrived at by calculating penaltiesfor what OSHA officials said were deliberate violations of federalsafety standards in a willful disregard of the law. Included were$5,000 fines each _ half the maximum allowed _ for 722 workersexposed to cumulative trauma disorders which OSHA said the companyhad made no effort to prevent through available engineering oradministrative controls.   The company was fined $710,000 for what OSHA called 71 separateinstances in which workers with the disorder _ some of whom requiredsurgery _ were given insufficient time off or denied lighter workduties while the injuries were healing.   The agency found that 63 workers underwent surgery between May1987, and May 1988, but were given an average of only 1.1 days off.Twenty-seven of them had no days off, the government said.   NIOSH recommends 30 to 60 days off depending on the type ofsurgery.   The company was fined $10,000 for exposing workers who sufferedthe injuries to the risk of aggravating them by not giving them timeoff.   OSHA officials said that 93 percent, or 817, of the 888 workerswith recorded trauma disorders had no time off and 39 percent, or345, had no benefit of temporary work restrictions.   OSHA last May fined another giant meatpacker, IBP Corp., $3.1million for similar violations at its Dakota City, Neb., plant.   Previously, the largest fine assessed against one employer was a$4.11 million levy in 1987 against the Bath Iron Works of Maine,primarily for construction safety violations. OSHA and the companylast week agreed to a $650,000 settlement, with Bath Iron Worksagreeing to a company-wide program to end the dangerous conditionsand a variety of other conditions.</TEXT></DOC>
