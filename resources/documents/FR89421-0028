Introduction</ITAG>A. Statutory AuthorityEPA is proposing to add 10 chemicals to the list of toxic substances undersection 313(d)(2) of SARA Title III. Section 313 of Title III requiresowners and operators of covered facilities to report annually their releasesof listed toxic chemicals. SARA section 313(d)(1) authorizes EPA to addor delete chemicals to the list of toxic chemicals by rulemaking at anytime. Section 313(d)(2) states that a chemical may be added if the Administratordetermines that there is sufficient evidence to establish that a chemicalis known to cause or can reasonably be anticipated to cause adverse acutehuman health effects based on recurring or continuous releases, chronichuman health effects, or environmental toxicity.B. BackgroundTo date, modifications to the list of toxic chemicals have occurred solelyas a result of petitions received by EPA under section 313(e). These petitionshave focused almost exclusively on requests for deletions and have ledto five proposed or final rules.While promulgated and proposed deletions to the list have been warranted,EPA recognizes the likelihood that there are chemicals not currently subjectto section 313 reporting requirements which meet the criteria for additionas described in section 313(d)(2). By reviewing numerous petitions, EPAhas been able to gain valuable experience in defining more precisely, thetypes of chemicals for which it would be most appropriate to require annualrelease reporting.This action represents only the first attempt by EPA to modify the listof reportable chemicals under section 313. EPA will continue to look toother sources to add chemicals to the list which pose known or anticipatedhealth and environmental hazards as established in section 313(d). TheAgency is currently looking into a more comprehensive effort in developinga process to screen chemicals for addition to and deletion from the section313 list; however, this effort is not the subject of this proposal. EPAinvites public comment on the approach used in this rulemaking as wellas on criteria for future additions to, and deletions from, the section313 list.EPA intends to evaluate public comment and promulgate a final rule by thefall of 1989 such that reporting for the identified chemicals will be requiredfor activities during the 1990 calendar year. Such reports would have tobe submitted to EPA and States by July 1, 1991.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Methodology and Rationale</ITAG>A. Development of the Addition CandidatesThere are currently over 2,500 chemicals which are regulated by EPA underits various statutes. As a starting point for screening candidates foraddition to the toxic chemical list under SARA section 313, EPA chose toexamine the list of chemicals under section 102 of the Comprehensive EnvironmentalResponse, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, (CERCLA)(Pub. L. 96-510), 42 U.S.C. 9601, <T3>et seq</T3>. CERCLA section 102(a) requires EPA to promulgate regulationsdesignating hazardous substances which may present substantial danger topublic health or welfare of the environment when releases to the environmentoccur. Section 102 of CERCLA also requires EPA to establish reportablequantities (RQs) for such chemicals. CERCLA section 103 (a) and (b) requiresthat persons in charge of vessels or facilities from which hazardous substanceshave been released in quantities that are equal to or greater than theRQs immediately report to the National Response Center.The CERCLA section 102 list was chosen for the first screening for a numberof reasons. The CERCLA section 102 list is the broadest list of chemicalsidentified as being of concern to various EPA programs. Also it is oneof the bases for reporting under another part of Title III (section 304)and is evolving into an ``umbrella'' list for Title III with the proposedaddition of the Extremely Hazardous Substances (section 302 of Title III)(54 FR 3388). Utilization of the CERCLA RQ list as a source of candidatesfor addition to section 313 can therefore serve to bring about some unificationfor chemicals subject to reporting under various Title III sections. Finally,toxicological evaluations have already been conducted for chemicals onthe CERCLA section 102 list and the resulting conclusions documented andreflected in the adjusted RQs.B. Criteria for the Candidate ListCERCLA section 102(a) allows EPA to adjust RQ levels for specific chemicals.In establishing and adjusting the RQ levels, EPA evaluates the intrinsicphysical, chemical, and toxicological properties of each chemical. Theprimary criteria used to adjust an RQ for a particular chemical are carcinogenicity,chronic toxicity, aquatic toxicity, mammalian toxicity, ignitability, andreactivity. EPA ranks each of these properties, with the exception of potentialcarcinogenicity, on a five-tier scale, associating a specified range ofvalues on each scale with a particular RQ. The five-tier scale uses thefive RQ levels (1, 10, 100, 1,000, and 5,000 pounds), while the three-tierscale for potential carcinogenicity uses three levels (1, 10, and 100 pounds).Thus, an RQ can be assigned for each of the above properties. The lowestof all of the tentative RQs becomes the ``primary criteria RQ'' for a particularsubstance. EPA then considers secondary criteria (biodegradation, hydrolysis,and photolysis) which may be used to adjust the ``primary criteria RQ''to establish a final RQ.In reviewing the RQ methodology for its application to the section 313(d)(2)criteria, EPA wanted to ensure that chemicals which are added to the section313 list have high concerns for properties which are most relevant to section313. For example, ignitability and reactivity which are not specificallymentioned in section 313(d) have not been considered in this rulemaking.For this reason, EPA considered only the criteria of chronic toxicity andcarcinogenicity. Although aquatic and mammalian toxicity are relevant tosection 313, EPA chose to only address chronic human toxicity in this rulemaking.As previously stated, this is EPA's first attempt to initiate modificationto the section 313 list; other section 313 toxicity endpoints, such asaquatic and mammalian toxicity, will be considered in future modifications.1. <T3>Chronic toxicity.</T3> When evaluated for chronic toxicity under theCERCLA methodology, chemicals are assigned scores which are based on theMinimum Effective Dose (MED) levels for repeated exposures and the severityof the effect (liver necrosis, birth defects, death, etc.) likely to because by repeated exposure. These scores are then used to assign the RQfor chronic toxicity. For a detailed explanation of the derivation of thescoring methodology see the Technical Background Document to Support RulemakingPursuant to CERCLA Section 102, Volume 2, August 1986 (Docket number: 102RQ-R1-3-1)available for inspection at Room LG-100, U.S. Environmental ProtectionAgency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC. As discussed in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of May 25, 1983 (48 FR 23564) for the proposedrulemaking on RQ adjustments, the MED and the severity of effect were eachassigned values of 1 to 10. A score of 10 for the MED Level indicates onlya small dose is required to elicit an effect. Similarly, a score of 10for severity of effect indicates the most severe effects were observedfor the MED, such as pronounced pathological changes or death. A compositescore is reached by multiplying the MED and effect scores. RQs are thenassigned based on these composite scores.2. <T3>Carcinogenicity.</T3> Details of the proposed CERCLA RQ methodologyfor assigning RQs for potential carcinogens can be found in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of March 16, 1987 (52 FR 8140). This is a proposedrulemaking which, as of this time, has yet to be finalized. EPA reviewsfour sources of human epidemiologic and/or animal bioassay data on hazardoussubstances that suggest possible carcinogenic effect. These sources are:(1) The Annual Report on Carcinogens of the National Toxicology Program,U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS); (2) the Monographsof the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC); (3) final Agencydeterminations published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>identifying substances as potential carcinogens;and (4) ongoing determinations by EPA's Office of Health and EnvironmentalAssessment that substances may be potential carcinogens.During the carcinogenic evaluation, EPA considers qualitative and quantitativeassessments to assign RQs. During the qualitative assessment, EPA evaluatesthe quality and reliability of the data to determine the ``weight of evidence''that a particular hazardous substance is a human carcinogen. The quantitativeassessment utilizes available data to calculate a potency factor. Thus,carcinogenic hazard ranking is based on the weight of evidence and potencydeterminations. For further discussion of the hazard ranking, see the TechnicalBackground Document to Support Rulemaking Pursuant to CERCLA Section 102,Volume 3, December 1986 (Docket number: 102RQ-273C-4) available for inspectionat Room LG-100, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington,DC.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Evaluation of CERCLA Chemicals for Addition to Section 313</ITAG>A. Thresholds for Developing a List for AdditionEPA used two criteria to evaluate chemicals on the CERCLA section 102 listfor addition to section 313, the CERCLA RQ scores for carcinogenicity andchronic toxicity and the production volume.Since the CERCLA section 102 list has already been evaluated by EPA forcarcinogenicity and chronic toxicity, EPA chose certain RQ scores as thresholdsfor these effects. Chemicals with assigned RQ levels at or below the thresholdare interpreted to meet the criteria established in section 313(d)(2).EPA set a RQ threshold level of 100 pounds for carcinogenicity and chronictoxicity based on the methodology and sources used to assign RQs for theseeffects. EPA believes that the assignment of RQs of 100 pounds or lessfor chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity could establish the finding thatmust be made under section 313(d) that these chemicals are known to causeor can reasonably be anticipated to cause cancer or other serious or irreversiblechronic effects in humans. For example, isosafrole (CAS Registry Number:120-58-1) has an assigned RQ of 100 pounds for carcinogenicity. In itsevaluation, EPA has ranked this chemical as a class B2 carcinogen accordingto EPA's Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment (51 FR 33992). Chemicalsare classifed as B2 carcinogens when there is sufficient evidence thatthe chemical causes cancer in animal studies and therefore is a probablehuman carcinogen. EPA believes that this evidence is sufficient to satisfythe SARA section 313(d) finding that isosafrole can reasonably be anticipatedto cause cancer in humans.Chemicals with final RQ scores of 100 or less based on aquatic toxicity,mammalian toxicity, ignitability, and reactivity were screened for scoresreflecting assessments based on their cancer and chronic toxicity potential.In other words, a chemical with a final RQ of 1 pound based on reactivitywas still screened for its carcinogenicity and chronic toxicity scores.If that score is less than or equal to 100 pounds, then the chemical meetsthe threshold outlined in this proposal.SARA section 313(f) established reporting thresholds related to the amountof a chemical that is manufactured, processed, or used. Thus EPA also screenedthe CERCLA section 102 list for production volume. Chemicals without aknown production volume are not proposed for addition even if they meetthe RQ threshold of 100 pounds. Production volume data for the CERCLA section102 list was gathered from the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) ConfidentialInventory Update System (1986). This data base contains production volumeinformation for a large number of chemicals from chemical manufacturers.EPA screened this data base for CERCLA section 102 chemicals with a minimumproduction volume of 25,000 pounds. This threshold corresponds to the section313 threshold for manufacturers and processors for the 1989 reporting yearand beyond.B. Proposed AdditionsEPA Initially screened the 611 chemicals on the CERCLA section 102 listfor chemicals with an underlying RQ for cancer or chronic toxicity of 100pounds or less. This resulted in a list of 156 chemicals. These chemicalswere then screened for associated production volumes of at least 25,000pounds. This resulted in a list of 18 chemicals for addition to the section313 list. Of these 18 chemicals, 9 were already reportable under one ofthe section 313 chemical categories. For example, strontium chromate isassigned as underlying RQ of 1 pound for carcinogenicity and has a significantproduction volume. It is not specifically listed on the section 313 listwith a CAS registry number, but it is reportable under section 313 as a``chromium compound.'' EPA decided not to propose listing these chemicalssince they are already reportable under the categories.The above analysis yields nine chemicals which EPA is proposing to addto the section 313 list. EPA has determined that each of these chemicalscauses or can reasonably be anticipated to cause cancer or serious irreversiblechronic health effects in humans.

Toxicologic profiles on each specific chemical can befound in the docket associated with each CERCLA <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice indicated in Table 1.1. <T3>Dinitrobenzenes.</T3> The derivation of RQ scores for <T3>ortho-, meta-, </T3>and <T3>para</T3>-dinitrobenzene is based on a subchronic study of <T3>meta</T3>-dinitrobenzene. EPA considers this approach appropriate inlight of the fact that the American Conference of Governmental IndustrialHygienists (ACGIH) considers that the toxicologic properties of all isomersshould be similar and has set identical standards for them.Male rats exposed orally to <T3>meta</T3>-dinitrobenzene in the diet for 16 weeks showed testicularatrophy with indication of loss of function. EPA believes this informationis sufficient to establish that <T3>ortho-, meta-,</T3> and <T3>para</T3>-dinitrobenzene are known or can reasonably be anticipatedto cause serious reproductive dysfunctions in humans.2. <T3>Allyl alcohol.</T3> Exposure of rats, guinea pigs, and rabbits to 17mg/m3 of allyl alcohol via inhalation for 7 hours per day, 5 days per weekfor 5 weeks led to necrosis of the liver and kidney. EPA believes thisinformation is sufficient to establish the finding that allyl alcohol isknown or can reasonably be anticipated to cause serious chronic healtheffects in humans.3. <T3>Diethylamine.</T3> Inhalation exposure of 50 parts per million of diethylamineto rabbits for 7 hours per day, 5 days per week for 6 weeks led to pulmonaryirritation, multiple punctate corneal erosions and edema, and histologicalchanges in the liver. EPA believes this information is sufficient to establishthat diethylamine is known or can reasonably be anticipated to cause seriouschronic health effects in humans.4. <T3>2,3-Dichloropropene.</T3> The RQ derivation for this chemical is basedon studies using 1,3-dichloropropene. RQ scores for 1,3-dichloropropeneare viewed by EPA to be protective for all dichloropropenes.In a subchronic inhalation study, rats exposed to 3 parts per million of1,3-dichloropropene for 4 hours per day, 5 days per week for 6 months,exhibited slight cloudy swelling of the renal tubular epithelium. Basedon the above data, EPA has determined there is sufficient information toestablish that the 2,3-dichloropropene is known to cause or can reasonablybe expected to cause serious chronic effects in humans.5. <T3>Isosafrole.</T3> A weight of evidence determination classifies isosafroleas a Group B2 carcinogen under the EPA Proposed Guidelines for CarcinogenicRisk Assessment (U.S. EPA, 1984). Evidence on potential carcinogenicityfrom animal studies is sufficient to determine that isosafrole is knownor can reasonably be anticipated to cause cancer in humans.6. <T3>Creosote.</T3> A weight of evidence determination classifies creosoteas a Group B1 carcinogen under the EPA Proposed Guidelines for CarcinogenicRisk Assessment. There is sufficient animal evidence and limited humanevidence to determine that creosote is known or can reasonably be anticipatedto cause cancer in humans.7. <T3>Dinitrotoluene (mixed isomers).</T3> A weight of evidence determinationclassifies dinitrotoluene (mixed isomers) as a Group B2 carcinogen underthe EPA Guidelines for Carcinogenic Risk Assessment. There is sufficientanimal evidence to determine that dinitrotoluene (mixed isomers) is knownor can reasonably be anticipated to cause cancer in humans.C. ToluenediisocyanateEPA also proposes to modify the section 313 list by adding the entry toluenediisocyanate(TDI) (mixed isomers) (CAS Registry Number: 26471-62-5). TDI is listedunder andSection; 372.65(a) and (b) for annual release reporting in two isometricforms. Specifically, these chemicals are toluene-2,4-diisocyanate (2,4-TDI)(CAS Registry Number: 584-84-9) and toluene-2,6-diisocyanate (2,6-TDI)(CAS Registry Number: 91-08-7). While manufacturers, processors, and usersof these two specific isomers are required to report under section 313,TDI is more commonly manufactured as a mixture of isomers, i.e., an 80:20mixture of 2,4- and 2,6-TDI. During the first year of reporting under sectin313, EPA received many questions pertaining to the reportability of TDImixtures.Furthermore, many Toxic Release Inventory forms were received containingthe CAS Registry Number (26471-62-5) for TDI as an isometric mixture. The section 313 list of toxic chemicals already contains similar entriesfor other isomeric mixtures. For example, <T3>o</T3>,-cresol (CAS Registry Number: 95-48-7), <T3>m</T3>-cresol (CAS Registry Number: 108-39-4), and <T3>p</T3>-cresol (CAS Registry Number: 106-4-5) are all individually listedon the section 313 list; however, there is also an entry for cresol (mixedisomers) (CAS Registry Number: 1319-77-3). Both of the specific isomers of TDI listed under section 313 have associatedacute, chronic, and environmental toxicity as summarized in a ChemicalHazard Information Profile. The most prominent health effects of TDI areof the respiratory tract, skin, eyes, and central nervous system. Respiratoryillnesses have been documented in workers from exposure to TDI which includeirritation of the upper and lower respiratory tract, an asthma-like sensitizationresponse, and decrements in lung function. Sensitization has been foundto occur at levels of less than 0.005 parts per million. EPA believes thatthe isometric mixture of TDI also meets the criteria in section 313(d)(2)because the TDI mixture causes or can reasonably be anticipated to causeserious or irreversible chronic effects. Therefore, EPA is proposing tomodify the list of toxic substances under section 313 to include the CASlisting, 26471-62-5, for the mixture.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Rulemaking Record</ITAG>The record supporting this proposed rule is contained in the docket numberOPTS-400021 and in the CERCLA dockets referenced in Table 1. Nonconfidentialdocuments, including an index of the docket, are available to the publicin the TSCA Public Docket Office from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday throughFriday, excluding legal holidays.

Regulatory Assessment Requirements.</ITAG>A. Executive Order 12291Executive Order (E.O.) 12291 requires each federal agency to classify as``major'' any rule like to result in:(1) An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; or(2) A major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or(3) Significant adverse effects on competition, investment, productivity,innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to competewith foreign-based enterprises in domestic and export markets.EPA's economic analysis estimates up to 659 additional reports entailingannual costs to EPA, industry, and States of about $786,000 as a resultof the proposed addition of 10 chemicals to the section 313 list of toxicchemicals. EPA anticipates that this proposed addition will not have asignificant effect on competition, costs, or prices. Therefore, EPA hasdetermined that this proposed rule is not ``major.''This proposed rule has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget(OMB) for review as required by E.O. 12291.B. Regulatory Flexibility ActThe Regulatory Flexiblity Act of 1980 requires each Federal agency to performa Regulatory Flexibility Analysis for all rules that are likely to havea ``significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.''40 CFR Part 372 exempts contain small businesses from reporting; specifically,those facilities with fewer than 10 full-time employees. This exclusionexempts about one-half of all manufacturing facilities in Standard IndustrialClassification (SIC) codes 20 through 39 from section 313 reporting. EPAestimates that the proposed addition of 10 chemicals will require reportingfrom less than 1 percent of manufacturing facilities with between 10 and50 employees.The analysis supporting this proposed rule anticipates that no segmentof the manufacturing sector is likely to suffer significant adverse effectsbecause of this rule. Reporting costs are estimated at less than 0.25 perecentof median sales per report for affected facilities with 10 to 19 full-timeemployees in manufacturing SICs 20 through 39. Based on the 10 proposedchemicals, it is unlikely that any facilities with 10 to 19 employees willhave to file reports for more than one chemical.Therefore, EPA certifies that this proposed rule will not have a significantimpact on a substantial number of small entities and that no RegulatoryFlexibility Analysis is needed.C. Paperwork Reduction ActOMB has approved the information collection requirements contained in thisproposed rule under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C.3501 <T3>et seq.</T3> and has assigned OMB control number 2070-0093.The public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimatedto average 23 hours per response, including time for reviewing instructions,searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed,and completing and reviewing the collection of information.Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of thiscollection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden,to Chief, Information Policy Branch, PM-223, U.S. Environmental ProtectionAgency, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office of Informationand Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, 726 Jackson PlaceNW., Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.''The final rule will respond to any OMB or public comments on the informationcollection requirements contained in this proposal.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 372</ITAG>Community right-to-know, Environmental protection, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements, Toxic chemicals.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: April 6, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William K.
