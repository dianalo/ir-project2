EC finance ministers pledged to submit such programs forreview starting this October. The decision was considered animportant first step to allay growing fears that unlesseconomic indicators such as inflation rates, public financesand trade deficits are brought closer into line, the EC'sdrive toward monetary union will be jeopardized.   An EC official said the adjustment programs could allowthe convergence needed to move to the final stage of monetaryunion, expected in the late 1990s.   The finance ministers failed to break a long-runningdeadlock on legislation to create a single market inbrokerage and investment services, raising questions aboutthe future of the proposals.                                                                                                          ITALY, MEXICO SIGN ACCORDS                                                                                                          Italy and Mexico signed agreements to broaden economiccooperation. Italy committed to lending to heavily indebtedMexico, though the amount wasn't disclosed and the terms willbe based on guidelines set by the Organization for EconomicCooperation and Development. The bilateral economic accordsprovide for commercial credits to be extended by Italianstate banks and for private loans of at least $500 million ayear for public and private projects in Mexico.                                                                                                          IRAN'S TRADE IN EASTERN EUROPE                                                                                                          Poland and Iran moved to boost trade. Warsaw told Tehranthat it is ready to cooperate in shipbuilding, machinemanufacturing and construction, and that it could exportwheat, meat and dairy products to Iran and buy non-oil goodsfrom Tehran. Poland seeks Iranian expertise in building anoil refinery. Separately, Bulgaria and Iran agreed to endbarter trade, and Sofia will pay cash for Iranian oil andother products. Tehran expressed readiness to grant a $100million credit to help Bulgaria boost its economy.                                                                                                          INDIA MOVES GOLD TO BRITAIN                                                                                                          India has flown 25 tons of gold to the Bank of England forcollateral in case it needs a loan to tide over aforeign-exchange shortage. It was the latest step by India'snew government to tackle an economic crisis, after devaluingthe rupee and revising cumbersome trade regulations in a bidto boost exports. India could raise loans of $200 million, or80% of the transferred gold's value. India's gold reservestotal 332 tons, valued at $4 billion.                                                                                                          LATIN AMERICA TO FIGHT CHOLERA   The Pan American Health Organization began a three-year,$610.5 million effort to control Latin America's choleraoutbreak. The World Health Organization unit's program wasoutlined in Miami at the first major international conferenceon the epidemic. More than 250,000 cases and at least 2,300deaths in the Americas have been reported in six nationssince January. The campaign is part of a 12-year, $200billion program to improve sanitation and water supplies inLatin America and the Caribbean.                                                                                                          YUGOSLAVIA'S TOURISM PLUMMETS                                                                                                          Tourism in Yugoslavia has fallen at least 80% since thenation's secessionist crisis began, officials said. Urged bytheir national governments, many tourists cut short orcanceled vacations. In Croatia, a tourism official said mostof about 70,000 tourists there now -- far fewer than theusual one million -- are Yugoslavs; some Germans there areignoring Bonn's warnings. Yugoslav officials said theAdriatic coast is peaceful. Many hotels and restaurantsclosed from lack of business, but several are open in eacharea. Coastal roads are open. Ferries from Italy areoperating.                                                                                                          FARM SUBSIDIES ARE CRITICIZED                                                                                                          Brazil criticized rich nations, saying their $300 billionin annual farm subsidies have forced food prices down andbankrupted growers in poor countries.   Brazil's agriculture minister told the Cairns Group of 14farm-goods exporting nations that subsidies make rationalagriculture practices impossible and threaten theenvironment. The group, led by Australia, was formed to fightsubsidies and unfair trading practices in farm products. Itis meeting in Manau, Brazil, to form a strategy for worldtrade talks.   The Cairns Group demands that the European Community andthe U.S. slash farm subsidies and allow the free market todecide where food can be produced most efficiently. Itinsists it won't allow an agreement at world trade talks inGeneva until the agricultural-subsidies question has beensettled. The Geneva talks, under auspices of the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade, have been stalled sinceDecember over the issue.   The group -- its members also include Argentina, Chile,Colombia, New Zealand, Canada, Thailand, the Philippines,Malaysia, Fiji, Hungary, Uruguay and Indonesia -- isconcerned about a subsidy war between the U.S. and the EC.

Prime Minister John Major said Britain planned to create anational agency to protect the environment. The agency willmonitor air and water, regulate emissions and discharges, andcoordinate international action to combat pollution. . . .Flooding has inundated hundreds of Chinese villages andhalted train service on major routes, includingBeijing-Shanghai.
