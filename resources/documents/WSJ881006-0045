White (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> SCR </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Eager to drum up new business, Wall Street is touting an investment technique to small investors that it has been pushing to institutional clients for years -- asset allocation.    That's a fancy way of saying split up your money among stocks, bonds, cash equivalents and other investments. Just how that split works depends on things like your age, investment objectives and willingness to take risk.    Listen to a salesman from Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., working the phone to pitch the firm's Investment Allocation Strategy: &quot;What it does,&quot; says the broker, reading from a script, is develop a &quot;formula showing how your investment assets should be allocated to take care of your present needs and future goals. Does that sound like it would be of value to you?&quot;    Almost 1,000 people a week since last May have said &quot;yes&quot; to the firm's free offer to run off a computerized analysis of the most profitable way to divy their assets. The tailor-made reports, running six to 10 pages, then list investments -- all offered by the firm -- to match the suggested asset mix.    Similarly, a free &quot;asset mix work sheet&quot; offered by T. Rowe Price Associates has drawn 87,000 requests since April, more than double the response of any previous offer made by the mutual-fund group. The four-page work sheet walks investors through questions on their financial goals and timetables, and then suggests investments to reach them.    Broad-brush allocation formulas have roots going back decades. But since the October 1987 crash, shell-shocked investors have flocked to the notion that individualized allocation programs are the best hedge against unexpected market violence. Brokers see it not only as a way to beat the bushes for new business, but also as a chance to grab a bigger share of current customers' business.    &quot;If we do this right, we've got a better chance of managing all of the client's portfolio, rather than just a third of it,&quot; says Stephen R. Cordill, head of Prudential-Bache's Investment Allocation Strategy program. Says an official of MetLife-State Street Investment Services, a Boston-based mutual-fund group that sells through brokerage firms: &quot;This is a new sales approach for a broker because it fits into a total financial planning mode.&quot;    Some experts fret that asset allocation is becoming more a marketing strategy than an investment technique.&quot;Portfolio allocation post-crash is being used as a method of getting investors to shift their funds around,&quot; says Jonathan Pond, president of Financial Planning Information Inc., a Cambridge, Mass., consulting firm. He thinks individuals need to watch their asset mix, but adds, &quot;The only thing you can be assured of is that the thing that {brokers} recommend to you to buy is something that they sell.&quot;    Prudential-Bache's Mr. Cordill says asset-allocation programs will fail if they don't provide good returns for the investor, and he thinks that can be done while still making a profit for the firm and commissions for the account executive. &quot;We see very few things come along that are win, win, win, but this is one of them,&quot; he says.    Asset allocation can be done many ways, all building on the idea of diversification to spread risk. Some plans call for a never-changing portfolio makeup, such as the widely publicized &quot;fixed mix&quot; of equal investments in U.S. stocks, U.S. bonds, foreign stocks, real estate and cash equivalents recommended by the San Mateo, Calif., investment firm of Bailard Biehl andamp; Kaiser.    A look at Prudential-Bache's plan shows how big brokerage firms are tailoring allocation programs in a bid to capture the largest number of investors. Prudential-Bache's computer can spin out any one of 300 basic investment portfolios based on the investor's answers to its questionnaire. In addition to age and risk tolerance, factors considered in coming up with recommended asset mix include portfolio size (under $250,000 is rated small; more than $750,000, large), cash flow and tax bracket.    Each computer-generated report lists Prudential-Bache products that match the asset categories recommended for the investor. There also are spaces where the firm's instruction manual advises brokers to &quot;write in the particular product(s) you would like your client to focus on.&quot;    For example, a 25-year-old investor willing to take moderate risk and planning a home purchase or other large outlay in the near future might be advised to put the largest chunk of his or her portfolio in Treasury bills, short-term certificates of deposit or other cash equivalents.    But for an aggressive investor at age 45, such liquidity is often unneeded and Prudential-Bache's program would put far more emphasis on moderate-growth investments, such as common stocks and variable life insurance. Such a portfolio also might include a number of so-called direct investment programs involving leveraged real estate or cable television properties. At least some tangible assets, such as coins, are recommended for a large number of portfolios.    Investors find that they often need to do fairly regular buying and selling to stay in line with their recommended asset mix. This is in part because the formulas themselves change along with an investor's age, family obligations and general economic conditions.    Most professional allocators split their portfolios among stocks, bonds and cash equivalents, raising a category, usually by no more than 5% or 10% at a time, when they think its potential return improves compared with the others.    Critics say this shifting smacks of market timing that tries to outguess future market moves, a strategy that has failed over the long haul. Allocators reply that they're only assessing which investments currently are paying the best return for the risk.    ---                   Selling Asset Allocation    Portfolios currently recommended under Prudential-Bache's Strategy:                25 Year Old    45 Year Old      65 Year Old  Characteristic*                                                Very  Risk level    Moderate       Agressive        conservative  Portfolio  size          $160,000       $600,000         $1.2 million  Excess  cash flow     Low            High             Low  Desired investments    Income      60%            10%              100%    Growth      40%            90%                0%  Investments recommended  Cash and  equivalents   $64,000 (40%)  $ 30,000 ( 5%)  $120,000 (10%)  Fixed income  $40,000 (25%0  $ 60,000 (10%)  $780,000 (65%)  Moderate  growth        $32,000 (20%)  $270,000 (45%)  $240,000 (20%)  Aggressive  growth        $ 8,000 ( 5%)  $ 90,000 (15%)         0  --  Direct  ownership     $ 8,000 ( 5%)  $120,000 (20%)         0  --  Tangible  assets        $ 8,000 ( 5%)  $ 30,000 ( 5%)  $ 60,000 ( 5%)  *Data provided by investor</TEXT></DOC>
