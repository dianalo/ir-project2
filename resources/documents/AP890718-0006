Scientists reported Monday they had located a gene that causesone form of the inherited disease, a step toward isolating andanalyzing the gene.   That analysis in turn could give leads for finding genes thatcause other forms of the disease, said researcher Peter Humphries.And finding out what the genes do may give researchers ideas fortreatment, he said.   Retinitis pigmentosa, called RP, progresses from night blindnessto tunnel vision to blindness. Symptoms are caused by degenerationin the retina, a delicate layer of cells at the back of the eye thatdetect images and relay them to the brain.   RP comes in several forms. About 20 percent of cases are causedby the ``autosomal dominant'' form, in which each child has a 50percent chance of inheriting the disease from an affected parent.   The gene in the new study may cause about half the autosomaldominant cases of RP, said study co-author Stephen Daiger, professorof medical genetics at the University of Texas Health Science Centerin Houston.   Other scientists located the gene for another form of RP severalyears ago, but they have not yet been able to isolate it, Daigersaid.   He and Humphries, who is lecturer in medical genetics at TrinityCollege in Dublin, Ireland, discussed the discovery at a newsconference sponsored by the Baltimore-based RP Foundation FightingBlindness. The organization supported the research.   The work is ``the first big step'' to isolating and analyzing thegene, said Gerald Chader, director of intramural research at theNational Eye Institute, in a telephone interview.   Genes lie on tiny thread-like structures called chromosomes. Somegenes cause disease when they fail to work correctly.   To locate particular genes, scientists begin with so-calledchemical ``markers'' on the genes. These markers, which can beeasily recognized in the laboratory, can be used to trace patternsof inheritance. When researchers find families with markers close toa gene of interest, they can move toward isolation of the geneitself.   The new work revealed a marker that appears to lie ``very, veryclose indeed'' to the RP gene on the chromosome scientists designatenumber 3, Humphries said.   Humphries and colleagues studied a family near Dublin that has100 living members, of whom half have RP. The work involvedcomparing genetic material from affected and unaffected familymembers.   It may take several years to isolate the gene, Daiger said.   Daiger said tentative data from his lab suggest that the genefound in the Irish family is not responsible for the disease in anAmerican family he is studying.   That is not surprising, since the two families have differentkinds of autosomal dominant RP, he said. The Irish family shows anearly-onset form, in which night blindness can be apparent as earlyas age 1, while the American family shows a late-onset form, inwhich night blindness may not appear until age 20 or later.   The work on the Irish family is to be published in the Octoberissue of the journal Genomics, the RP foundation said.</TEXT></DOC>
