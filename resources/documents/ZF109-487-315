information systems also apply onthe shop floor: Keep the users involved, and don't overload them withcomplexity.andM;Five years ago, morale was &quot;very low&quot; among the 800 employees at the subwayrepair shop, recalled Lars Updale, assistant chief mechanical officer withthe authority's Car Equipment Division.andP;  Drinking was common, and theattitude was &quot;the less I do, the better off I am,&quot; said Updale.andM;Today, all that has changed.andP;  A walk through the 200,000-square-foot shopfound work crews hustling to repair the wheel and motor assemblies, called&quot;trucks,&quot; on which the subway cars ride.andM;A sign boasts that &quot;207th Street put Mandamp;K out of OUR Truck Business,&quot; areference to how repair work that had been farmed out to Morrison KnudsenCorp. was brought back in-house after the 207th Street shop improved thequality of its work.andM;There are many reasons for the changes, including the threat to out-sourcethe repair work and putting non-union managers in charge of the workers.andM;But another reason for the improvement can be found in a small cubicle nextto the assembly line where the 18,000-pound trucks are torn down andreassembled.andM;There, a supervisor taps on a grimy keyboard of a 286-based diskless PC andcalls up a map showing which trucks are on the shop floor and what work needsto be done on them.andM;The map is part of the Automated Truck Management (ATM) system, running on aCompaq Computer Corp. 386 server linked to the workstations by a Novell Inc.andO;NetWare 2.15 LAN.andM;The system helps supervisors manage the work flow in the shop, tracksmanagement information such as the productivity of the workers and tracks thehistories of the trucks and the components on them, said Updale.andM;Installed in December 1988, the ATM replaced a paper-based work-trackingsystem that included 25,000 cards as well as massive daily and weeklyproduction reports, said Mel Krakowski, the division's director ofinformation systems and administration.andM;With 25,000 trucks circulating around the authority's tracks, the paper-basedsystem was cumbersome, hard to maintain and often inaccurate, said Krakowski.andM;&quot;With work being carried over to other shifts on paper, there was a potentialfor dropping a [repair] job and not getting it done,&quot; said Updale.andP;  &quot;With thecomputer tracking system, the job is done and checked off.&quot;andM;The ATM costs $26,500 for the six workstations, a server and a NetWare 2.15network operating system, as well as two man-years of developers time, saidKrakowski.andM;A companion system for a subway car overhaul operation in the same buildingcosts $21,000 for hardware and operating system, and six months of developerstime.andM;The two systems haven't enabled workers to do more overhauls in an eight-hourday, said Updale, but &quot;quality has improved, and I consider thatproductivity.&quot;andM;Systemwide, transit officials pointed out, the subway car fleet now averages26,000 miles between breakdowns, an 18,000-mile improvement since 1984.andP;  Theofficials gave partial credit to the new systems at 207th Street.andM;Push for New SystemsandM;Much of the push for the new systems came from the employees and supervisorsthemselves, said Krakowski.andP;  Those users were also heavily involved in theprototyping and development, he said.andM;&quot;Everyone [doing] the programming involved as many people as possible fromthe shop floor,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;I believe these systems have to be designed fromthe shop floor up.&quot;andM;This hands-on involvement has changed the corporate culture in the shop &quot;toat least let a mechanic touch a computer, and trust the computer,&quot; saidUpdale.andP;  &quot;The key thing was to get the computer on the [shop] floor, so themechanic and the supervisor can see it and use it.andP;  It breaks the mystique ofcomputers.&quot;andM;It was important, though, to avoid overloading the system.andM;For example, according to Krakowski, some mechanics suggested a voice-reponsesystem that would allow them to dictate what work needed to be done on a carfrom trackside.andM;&quot;You have to show them what you want doesn't always pay to have&quot; or isn'ttechnologically feasible, he said.andM;&quot;What we have right now is pretty low on the range of shop-floor controls,&quot;Updale said.andM;But these first systems have helped pave the way for a full manufacturingresource planning (MRP II) system the shop hopes to buy so it can move towardless expensive just-in-time ordering of parts.andM;&quot;We're building a much bigger system,&quot; said Updale, but &quot;we're going to startthe same way--from the mechanic up.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
