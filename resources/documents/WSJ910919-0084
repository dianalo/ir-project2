The test can help clinicians tell which patients should bereferred for more invasive or extensive procedures,especially cardiac catheterization.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Clinicians have tended to use rules of thumb and informal{rules} to decide who should go for catheterization and whoshould not,&quot; says Dr. Daniel B. Mark, assistant professor ofmedicine at Duke Medical Center and principal author of areport on the test score in today's New England Journal ofMedicine. &quot;This puts the clinician who is using a treadmilltest on firmer footing.&quot;   Nearly one million Americans undergo cardiaccatheterizations each year to determine whether the arteriesthat feed blood to the heart muscle are blocked. Theprocedure entails threading a catheter through blood vesselsinto the heart, injecting a dye and taking X-ray pictures toobserve possible obstruction. It is possible that thetreadmill score could allow people to avoid having theprocedure.   The score is derived from a formula based on the length oftime a person is on a treadmill and one of two measures ofpossible obstruction, including chest pain and a measurementdetected by an electrocardiogram taken during the treadmilltest. Scores range from minus 25, the highest risk, to plus15.   The researcher studied 613 people referred to Duke MedicalCenter as outpatients with suspected heart trouble andfollowed them for at least four years. About two-thirds ofthe patients scored higher than plus 5 and constituted alow-risk group, whose four-year survival rate was 99%. Such alow death rate raises the question of whether such patientsshould be subjected to invasive diagnostic procedures thatcarry a slight risk of death themselves.   In an editorial accompanying the report, Dr. Robert O.Bonow of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute saidthat unless special circumstances require a more thoroughevaluation, patients falling in the low-risk group under theDuke scoring system &quot;could be managed safely without therisks and expense of coronary arteriography,&quot; orcatheterization.</TEXT></DOC>
