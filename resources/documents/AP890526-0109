(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A grand jury refused to indict a youngmother for manslaughter in her infant's death, which was linked toalleged cocaine use during pregnancy, authorities said today.   Prosecutors had charged Melanie Green, 24, with involuntarymanslaughter and delivery of a controlled substance to a minor, acharge usually used against street-corner drug dealers.   A Winnebago County grand jury that met Thursday did not indicther on any charge, State's Attorney Paul Logli said.   Ms. Green's 2-day-old baby, Bianca, died Feb. 4. Cocaine wasfound in Bianca's system and in her mother's, said Dr. P. JohnSeward, the county coroner. The drug was carried through theplacenta to the fetus, reducing Bianca's ability to accept oxygenfrom the mother and resulting in brain damage.   Logli had characterized that process as delivery of a controlledsubstance.   Ms. Green had accepted an offer of free representation from theAmerican Civil Liberties Union in the case.   In a similar case, another mother in this northern Illinois cityof 140,000 was convicted May 1 of prenatal child abuse for usingcocaine throughout her pregnancy, including the hours right beforeshe gave birth. That child survived.   On Thursday, the mother, whose name was not released because sheis a juvenile, regained custody of her 6-month-old daughter. ButJudge Frederick J. Kapala made the custody arrangement temporary,pending a hearing July 6 in which the woman must demonstrate thatshe can give the baby a good home.   ``If the mother is making progress and shows she is providing anurturing environment for the child, the state is consideringplacing (full) guardianship with the mother,'' Assistant State'sAttorney Gary Golian said.   The child was placed in a foster home after Kapala found thewoman guilty May 1 of prenatal abuse.   At the time, the judge said he was forced to ``take a stand'' onthe issue of fetus rights after testimony showed the woman had usedcocaine up to a few hours before birth.   The woman has completed a drug rehabilitation program, said herattorney, Alberto F. Altamore.</TEXT></DOC>
