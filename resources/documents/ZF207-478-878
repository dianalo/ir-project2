QuarkXPress 2.1 offers relief right now, andFontSizer has been serving as an interim plane toward screenfont Nirvana.andP;  Ifyou want to WYSIWYG wisely, here's the scoop.andM;The Solution OutlinedandM;Since font outlines are so versatile, we should abandon bit maps and useoutline fonts for both screen and print.andP;  Outlines can be resized anddisplayed with great fidelity to the original typeface.andP;  Screen fonts of anysize (12, 22, 99, 116) are available in any application.andP;  With bettervisualization and size flexibility, you may be inspired to use large displaytype more frequently, in odd sizes and in more creative ways.andP;  Low-resolutiondevices earn new respect because their text output comes from smoothoutlines.andM;U.S.andP;  MicroLabs markets FontSizer, a utility that produces precisely sizedbitmapped screen versions of any PostScript outline font in sizes from 12 to127 points.andP;  (Actually, the utility orders an Adobe PostScript printer to doit for you.) Provided you have access to the printer, this scheme isinexpensive.andP;  These custom screen fonts are usable by all programs.andP;  Youmust, however, create all the screen fonts you need while keeping an eye ondisk space - a single font in a large point sizecan exceed 100K.andM;If you need typographic WYSIWYG for page layout and haven't bought apage-layout program, consider QuarkXPress.andP;  Version 2.1 offers outline-basedscreen fonts.andP;  Although you can use fonts from any vendor in QuarkXPress, thescreen-font WYSIWYG feature works only with Type 3 (unencrypted) fonts, whichexcludes Adobe's type library.andM;Apple's Outline FontsandM;Apple's System 7, scheduled to ship in early 1990, will offer outline-fontcapabilities for both printing and screen display.andP;  The new font format isoptiiiiized for rendering accuracy and display speed.andP;  Apple claims thataccess to outline fonts will be automatic and totally transparent to existingprograms.andP;  With System 7's Layout Manager, you'll see sophisticatedtypographic effects such as kerning and ligatures.andP;  However, applicationswill need to be upgraded to take advantage of these effects.andM;Apple's fonts will print well on a wide variety of non-PostScriptdevices-from the ImageWriter to the LaserWriter IISC - at any resolution.andP;  Onthe other hand, they'll require translation (by a conversion utility Adobeplans to develop) before printing to a PostScript device such as yourfriendly LaserWriter.andM;Apple will supply a basic set of fonts in its format.andP;  The technology ispublic,andM;and vendors that plan to offer typefaces in the Apple format include Adobe,AGFA Compugraphic, Bitstream, Casady andamp; Greene, Kingsley/ATF, and URW.andO;Typemanipulation software such as LetraStudio and TypeStyler will be upgradedto work with Apple's font format.andP;  Fortunately, with System 7 you cancontinue to use both PostScript and bit-mapped fonts.andP;  With the rightcombination of utility software, your system should be able to handle any mixof font technologies.andM;Banking on Adobe's ATMandM;Adobe Systems will dispense some systemwide relief this fall with its AdobeType Manager (ATM).andP;  Much like Apple's System 7, this transparent utilitywill provide the benefits of outline screen fonts to all applications.andP;  ATMis designed to work primarily with Adobecompatible (Type I or encrypted)fonts.andP;  Fortunately, several type vendors are now licensed to produce them.andO;Adobe is also investigating ways for ATM to support Type 3 fonts supplied bysuch companies as Bitstream and Kingsley/ATF.andM;ATM will work with both System 6 and System 7.andP;  Moreover, ATM will letupgraded applications access Apple's System 7 Layout Manager.andP;  For ATM towork, your System Folder must contain the PostScript outlines of any fontsyou're likely to use, even fonts that are resident on your printer.andO;PostScript effects such as fill and stroke will be printed but may not appearon-screen.andM;What about printing to non-Adobe PostScript devices? ATM will use outlinefonts for output to low-resolution printers such as the ImageWriter familybut not to high-resolution devices.andP;  Adobe doesn't want to muscle in on itsown market by supplying non-PostScript printers with clean Adobe outlines.andM;What About Service Bureaus?andM;If you depend on a service bureau for output, you should do as your bureaudictates, at least for out-of-house printing.andP;  Regarding Apple fonts, someservice bureaus are spooked by visions of new font discrepancies.andP;  Otherswelcome the birth of the WYSIWYG screen font, because it increases theircustomers' appreciation fortypography and may encourage greater use of bureauservices.andP;  Bureaus already have PostScript-based systems that work.andP;  Unlessthey see profitable demand, there's little motivation to support Apple fontsand make major system changes.andM;By the time System 7 is released, more factors - prices, upgrade policies,and compatibility and performance data - will be known.andP;  Any font setup youhave should work when you move to System 7, so you'll have the opportunity toadjust your font strategy.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
