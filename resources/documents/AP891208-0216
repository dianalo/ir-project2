This time most of the experts are optimistic. Except forlocalized repercussions in one-industry towns, the plowshareprospects raised by President Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev in thestormy seas off Malta promise mostly benefits, they say.   Still, some analysts are worried about local depressions andwhether managers can adopt to civilian production at a time ofextreme import competition.   ``I'd like to see the government come up with a plan to helppeople in a graceful and humane way, but you talk about anindustrial policy in this country and they call you a communist,''says Lawrence J. Korb, who served in the Reagan administration asan assistant defense secretary.   Congress' Joint Economic Committee is concerned enough to havecalled hearings this week and next on ``the economic consequencesof reduced defense spending and the winding down of the Cold War.''   There is not much dispute that military spending is heading inonly one direction: down. Defense Secretary Richard Cheney has toldhis service chiefs to list programs that can be slowed orjettisoned.   Former Rand Corp. executive William W. Kaufmann, now at Harvardand the Brookings Institution, says that if the U.S.-Sovietrelationship continues to blossom the defense budget can shrink byhalf in 10 years.   ``Virtually no one thinks the defense budget will not fall,''says Gordon Adams, director of the Defense Budget Project, aWashington research outfit.   ``Everyone is pretty well convinced that it is going to be, atbest, flat,'' agrees John Ruby, chief operating officer of FordAerospace, the weaponry arm of Ford Motor Co. ``There'll probablybe fewer ships, planes and tanks built.''   One scenario said to have been floated by Cheney himself callsfor trimming previous estimates of Pentagon spending _ which someconsider intentionally padded _ by $180 billion over five years,with most coming in the last two years. This year's Pentagonspending amounts to $300 billion.   ``Depending on its size and speed, a substantial cut in defensespending phased in over a number of years could be one of the bestthings that could happen to the economy,'' says Charles Schultze,who was President Carter's chief economic adviser. ``One thing thiscountry does not have is a surplus of skilled engineers and skilledworkmen.''   Still, when the machines of war are complex electronic systems,the task of converting plants and jobs to a civilian economy isn'tas easy as it was after World War II, when Detroit shifted smoothlyfrom making tanks to making Buicks.   No civilian market exists for stealth aircraft or Sidewindermissiles. And managers used to the hothouse environment of Pentagoncontracting _ with no competition from overseas, a single,cooperative customer and cost-plus-profit accounting _ may havetrouble adjusting to marketplace realities.   ``Defense contractors are used to being told what the marketis,'' says consultant Jacques Gansler, author of ``AffordingDefense'' and a Pentagon procurement official in 1972-77. ``Thecommercial world isn't like that.''   He says long-term planning is required: ``If you start to planwhen you get your notice to close the plant, you're in trouble.''   Seymour Melman, retired professor of industrial engineering atColumbia University and a pioneer advocate of planned conversion,strongly disagrees with those who say the economy can absorbmilitary budget cuts without severe dislocations.   He argues that to smooth the transition an elaborate governmentretraining and readjustment program will be required.   No planning can mean a crisis for defense industry workers,Melman says.   ``What are they going to work at?'' he asks. ``Making shoes?Eighty-five percent of our shoes are imported. Consumerelectronics? All imported. Machine tools? Half are imported.''   Moreover, Melman argues, defense managers are equally incapableof making the leap to the civilian economy without retraining.Putting them in the private economy with the habits acquired in alifetime of doing business only with the Pentagon would invitedisaster, he says.   To make his point, he cites the ``technological chauvinism''that led aerospace engineers to design elaborate trolley cars forthe Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority which repeatedly broke down.   ``No major military-serving enterprise has demonstrated anautonomous ability to carry out the sort of occupational switchthat is needed to go civilian,'' Melman wrote in his book,``Profits Without Production.''   ``If you unleash these people, the U.S. will turn into athird-rate economy,'' Melman says. ``They can't hack it. We willlose the capability of repairing the damage.''   But economist Sar Levitan of George Washington University saysthe American economy will create demand for the goods and serviceslaid-off defense workers can provide.   ``We have found in the last few years that human needs areinsatiable,'' he says. ``Even if everyone has a refrigerator, wewant VCRs and toys for the kids that cost hundreds of dollars. Wewant more vacations and more health care. If it is an orderlydiminution in the defense establishment, then I don't think itwould be a verious serious problem.''   But, he adds, ``If the economy is weak, Congress would be muchmore resistant to any defense cuts, whether we need the weapons ornot.''   Liberals in Congress have pushed for years for ``conversion''legislation to ease the transition away from big defense layouts.   Under a version sponsored by Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., defensecontractors would be required to put 1.25 percent of receipts intoa fund to pay the costs of economic adjustment. Laid-off workersmight get 90 percent of their lost salaries while being retrainedfor civilian jobs.   Opponents see such proposals as governmental interference in thefree market.   Says Adams: ``Counseling, retraining, job search and relocationprograms are critical; income supplements, however, slow theadjustment process.''   Says Melman in rebuttal: ``In other words, let the workingstiffs take a job at any pay.''   Some defense contractors don't want to think about converting tothe civilian economy, no matter what the future levels of defensespending.   ``We have no plans to go to commercial accounts,'' says PeteConnolly, spokesman for General Dynamics in St. Louis. ``There maybe fewer swords to beat into plowshares, but that's what we'regoing to continue to do.''   Gansler, senior vice president of Analytic Sciences Corp., saysdefense spending cuts have only a gradual impact. Generally,Pentagon contracts provide for prohibitive penalty payments if theyare canceled.   ``And when you stop spending in some areas of defense, you haveto increase it in others,'' Gansler adds. ``You want to increaseyour intelligence gathering and your long-term research anddevelopment so that there are no technological surprises in store.... I don't look for a trashing of the industry.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Monday AMs, Dec. 11</NOTE></DOC>
