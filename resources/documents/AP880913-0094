On the New York Mercantile Exchange this morning, prices fornear-term contracts of crude oil opened slightly higher thanMonday's closing prices.   Crude futures prices had skidded below $14 a barrel Monday butthen surged higher in the final hour of trading after Saudi KingFahd called for joint cooperation between OPEC and non-OPECproducers in establishing production limits.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the October contract fordelivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S.crude, was trading between $14.50 and $14.58 a 42-gallon barrel inearly trading today, compared with Monday's $14.49 closing price.Before the late rally Monday, the contract had dropped to $13.75,the lowest level since oil traded for $13.73 on Oct. 29, 1986.   Contracts for refined oil products also were trading higher thismorning. Wholesale unleaded gasoline for October delivery rangedbetween 42.90 cents and 43.50 cents a gallon, compared withMonday's closing of 42.62 cents. The October wholesale heating oilcontract ranged between 41.80 cents a gallon and 42.05 cents,compared with Monday's settlement price of 41.68 cents.   Fahd's statement could indicate Saudi Arabia _ the world'sbiggest crude exporter _ was moving to take a leadership role andlower its own oil production, said George Konikowski, an analyst atSmith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co.   Two years ago when oil prices hit similar lows, Saudi productioncurbs helped reverse the market's decline, traders said.   ``If the king says he doesn't want the market to go much loweryou would think the Saudis would set some limits,'' said PeterBeutel, an energy analyst with Elders Futures Inc. ``It looks likeprices are going to stabilize in this range.''   Monday's early selloff was fueled by anxieties about thecontinuing world oil glut.   Analysts said Fahd's statement came as the market was lookingfor positive news following a string of negative indicators thathad steadily eroded prices.   Fahd's statement, reported by the official Saudi Press Agencyfollowing a weekly government Cabinet session, had a strong impacton the market because the king rarely makes public statementrelated to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,brokers said.   Before the statement was released, analysts had focused on theinability of OPEC's 13 members to keep within their productionquotas despite the worldwide oversupply of oil.   After predicting prices could drop below $13 a barrel by week'send, some analysts reversed their position by the end of Monday'ssession, saying such an assessment was now overly pessimistic.   OPEC members are scheduled to meet in Vienna, Austria, Nov. 21.   As more oil floods the market, refiners have taken advantage ofthe bargain rates to pad their inventories before winter, analystssaid. Normally, refiners build up inventories during the summermonths, but with refineries near capacity, the extra oil is goinginto storage rather than refining.   ``Everyone thinks prices are probably at the lowest they'regoing to see through the remainder of the year,'' said Ken Miller,senior principal and engineer at Purvin andamp; Gertz Inc. petroleumconsulting firm in Houston.</TEXT></DOC>
