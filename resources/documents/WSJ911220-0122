In late Toronto Stock Exchange trading yesterday, CanadianOccidental fell to 23.875 Canadian dollars (US$20.67) ashare, down 50 Canadian cents, an unusually steep drop forthe stock. Analysts viewed it as a paradoxical response to anannouncement that the oil and gas producer plans to proceedwith a US$500 million plan to develop the Yemen find.</LP><TEXT>   Canadian Occidental said late Wednesday that, based on theresults of discoveries on a part of the Masila block inYemen, it calculates there are 550 million barrels of oil inplace and 235 million recoverable barrels of oil discoveredso far in the block, a find that some Canadian oil analystshave said could become &quot;a worldclass gusher.&quot;   But analysts said investors had been expecting anannouncement that recoverable reserves would be much higher,perhaps as much as 500 million barrels.   &quot;Back in November, Occidental Petroleum {Corp. of LosAngeles, which owns a 48% stake in Canadian Occidental} toldanalysts in New York that recoverable reserves would be about300 million barrels,&quot; said Don Whatley, an industry analystwith Bunting Warburg Inc. in Toronto. &quot;Then the Yemenigovernment came out and said they expected 490 millionbarrels of recoverable oil to be identified.&quot;   Mr. Whatley said Canadian Occidental's announcement wasbased on results from only three finds in the 6.8million-acre Masila block and described the reserve estimatesas &quot;very conservative.&quot; He said the 24-inch pipeline thatCanadian Occidental and its partners plan to build to shipoil to a coastal terminal is large for the 120,000 barrels ofoil a day that Canadian Occidental said are expected to beshipped through it beginning in late 1993.   Canadian Occidental has been cautious about discussing thesize of the Yemen oil find. It issued a news release warninginvestors against excessive speculation after the Yemengovernment described one of the Masila wells as the largestoil-producing well in the country, producing 10,000 barrelsdaily. In fact, Larry Murphy, Canadian Occidental's vicepresident of corporate affairs, said one well has tested at aflow rate of 10,000 barrels, with a second well testing at12,000 barrels.   Mr. Murphy declined to estimate any increase in reserves,but he said that &quot;we hope there's a lot more out there.&quot; Hesaid the current reserve estimate is based on drillingresults on only three exploration ventures in three sectionsof the Masila block. He added that the Hunt field in northernYemen has reported recoverable reserves of more than onebillion barrels, up from original estimates of 500 millionbarrels.   Caution on Canadian Occidental's part hasn't diminishedinvestor curiosity, however.   At the beginning of the year, Canadian Occidental stockwas changing hands at just C$13.75 to C$14. Since theannouncement that the company had been granted a license toexplore and develop the Masila block, followed by a series ofsuccessful drilling programs in Yemen, the stock has climbedas high as C$24.88.   Analysts said the US$500 million that Canadian Occidental,which has a 52% interest in the project, and its partnersplan to spend to develop the discoveries to date works out toabout $2 for each recoverable barrel of oil, a ratio theydescribed as &quot;pretty attractive.&quot; They said it would berelatively inexpensive to expand those facilities toaccommodate added production.   Another Occidental affiliate, Occidental Peninsula Inc.,has an 18% stake in the Yemen venture, while Pecten YemenCo., a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group's Shell Oil Co.subsidiary, has a 20% stake. Consolidated ContractorsInternational Co., a Greek construction concern based inAthens, holds the remaining 10%.</TEXT></DOC>
