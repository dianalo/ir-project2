The system optimizes plant operationeither on profitability, production, feedstock consumption or energyconsumption as desired. The system incorporates a flowsheet package.The model of the cracking section of the plant is the most importantfor optimization considerations and is dealt with in some detail. Datahandling in large systems is discussed and typical energy savings froman application are calculated for a 1000 t/day plant. (U.K.).</TEXT></DOC>
