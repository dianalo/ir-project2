The multi-bladed windmill is often adopted, taking the scenic beautyof nature into consideration, in the resort and other districts. To elucidatethat windmill in characteristics and contribute to the wind force powergeneration system design, an approx. 1 m diameter horizontal axis six-bladedwindmill was prototypically built and tested in a wind tunnel. By adoptinga DC generator, as a load against windmill, developed for the wind forcepower generation system purpose, it was connected to the windmill at4 in speed increasing ratio. In the wind tunnel test, the relation betweenthe blade pitch angle and output power coefficient was studied. Withthe enlargement in blade pitch angle, the circumferential speed ratio,where appears the maximum circumferential speed coefficient, trends tobecome small. In the range of 15 to 20 degrees in blade pitch angle,it showed the almost constant maximum output power coefficient of 0.13,which was small as compared with that of propellerform windmill. Whileas the blade pitch angle of propellerform windmill to obtain the maximumoutput power is approx. 10 degrees, that of multi-bladed windmill islarge. (17 figs, 3 tabs, 9 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
