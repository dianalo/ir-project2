The latest bid seems to have turned the Florida financier's quest to acquire Pay 'N Pak into a grudge match with top company officials. As previously reported, Mr. Bilzerian and the company's management group have been bidding against each other for the retailer of home improvement products for more than a week.    Under Mr. Bilzerian's latest bid, shareholders would receive $17 in cash, plus preferred stock valued at $5. The newly issued stock would pay an annual dividend of 16%. It hasn't been determined whether the dividend would be in cash or stock.    The Kent, Wash.-based company announced Monday that it agreed to a leveraged buyout proposal from Rosewood Holdings, which includes Chairman David J. Heerensperger and other officers.    Under that plan, shareholders would receive $17 in cash for each of their shares, plus preferred stock valued by the company at $4.25 each. The preferred's 17% dividend is payable in stock. The management offer, which is contingent on receipt of at least two-thirds of the company's shares outstanding, only slightly topped an earlier offer from Mr. Bilzerian.    The investor has denounced Pay 'N Pak for accepting the group's bid without first offering him a chance to respond. On Monday, he withdrew his earlier professions of confidence in company management, saying that now &quot;I couldn't throw them out fast enough.&quot;    In a letter to the company's financial adviser, Salomon Brothers Inc., Mr. Bilzerian called the Pay 'N Pak action &quot;irresponsible, contrary to the board's fiduciary duties, and inconsistent with the bid procedure rules established by the company.&quot;    He added that &quot;the only reason which has been provided to us for the board's hasty acceptance of the Rosewood Holdings bid was that it 'wanted to get it over with.' This reason is inadequate.&quot;    Pay 'N Pak officials weren't available for comment.    The buyout agreement Pay 'N Pak reached with the management group calls for the group to receive a cancellation fee of $6 million if the company accepts a higher bid, or if a third party acquires 30% or more of Pay 'N Pak's 10 million common shares outstanding.    Under the plan, the group would also receive &quot;reasonable&quot; out-of-pocket expenses and fees up to $3.5 million in conjunction with the transaction. Mr. Bilzerian's letter said his latest offer is based on the assumption that the break fee and expense reimbursement plan &quot;are not legally binding, and will be revoked.&quot;    Mr. Bilzerian could make a sizable profit on his 10% Pay 'N Pak stake, if he were to drop his bid. The company's shares were trading at just over $13 before the investor disclosed his initial interest in a March filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.    In April, Pay 'N Pak rebuffed Mr. Bilzerian's initial $19-a-share all-cash proposal, and said it would seek other buyout bids. Mr. Bilzerian later made another bid of $17 in cash plus $4 in preferred, after signing a standstill agreement in exchange for a look at non-public company information. At any rate, the only proposals disclosed by the company have been those made by the management group and Mr. Bilzerian.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Pay 'N Pak closed yesterday at $21.125 a share, up 50 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
