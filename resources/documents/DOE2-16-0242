The test for the waste water of a radiator repairshop was carried out adding 8 to 16 g/l of MS at pH of 6 to 11 by stirringfor two hours and the treated waste water met the requirements specifiedin the regulations. The tests of waste waters of barrel polishing andglass polishing were made adding 2 g/l of MS at pH of 11.5 by stirringfor two hours followed by leaving at rest for 16 hours and the treatedwaste waters met the requirements specified in the regulations. Mostof Mg in the waste water of a refuse incinerator was able to be removedin the test carried out adding 5 g/l of MS at pH of 4 to 10. MS is anion exchanger mainly composed of CaO, CaS and FeS. The heavy metals containedin waste water are, therefore, coprecipitated in the forms of M-O H andMS. In addition, MS has another function to substitute Ca contained inMS for the heavy metals.
