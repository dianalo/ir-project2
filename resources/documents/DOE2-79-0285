<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-79-0285 </DOCNO><TEXT>A laser resonance absorption spectrometer is used to investigate the characteristicsof both self and nitrogen collision broadened carbon dioxide in resonancewith He--Ne laser radiation at 4.2 {mu}m. The absorption coefficientin these broadening conditions has contributions from the R(28) to R(34)absorption lines of the {nu}{sub 3} CO{sub 2} spectrum. The Fletcher-Powelloptimization method is used to reduce the raw absorption data and tofind the best value average collision broadening coefficient and laseremission frequency for a Lorentzian line shape model of the contributinglines. Pure carbon dioxide absorption in a pressure range of from 0.0016atm (1.25 Torr) to 0.33 atm (250 Torr) is described well by the modelwith an average self broadening coefficient of 0.084 +- 0.008 cm/sup-1/ atm/sup -1/ for laser frequencies located at either 2370.591 +- 0.020cm/sup -1/ or 2371.135 +- 0.019 cm/sup -1/. Nitrogen broadened carbondioxide in the total pressure range of from 0.13 atm (100 Torr) to 1.18atm (900 Torr) is characterized by the same model with the laser frequencyat 2371.102 +- 0.023 cm/sup -1/ and average nitrogen broadening coefficientof 0.067 +- 0.007 cm/sup -1/ atm/sup -1/. The average absorption coefficientfor low concentrations of carbon dioxide in a 1-atm total pressure nitrogenenvironment has been determined experimentally as 9.90 +- 1.49 cm/sup-1/ atm/sup -1/.
