Brack Jr., the new chief executive officer of Time Inc.'s magazine group, is moving quickly to cut costs and reassess the company's magazine development plans in the face of bleak national advertising prospects and concern over Time's vulnerability to corporate raiders.    Mr. Brack last month succeeded longtime magazine group head Kelso Sutton, who took Mr. Brack's old job as head of the much smaller books division. In an interview, Mr. Brack said there won't be any sweeping layoffs or &quot;across-the-board cuts.&quot; But he did say &quot;managing editors and division heads have been asked to reexamine the way we do business. We're operating in a difficult, low-growth environment, and we're saying, 'Let's reassess everything.'&quot;    Mr. Brack has already scuttled one magazine development project, a monthly called Leisure, and he says the company is &quot;taking a hard look at everything else,&quot; including a real estate magazine focusing on the Northeast and two monthlies, Quality, and Home Office. As previously reported, the company recently decided not to proceed with a photo newsweekly, Picture Week, after market testing it for more than a year.    Separately, real estate industry sources say Time is considering putting up for sale its midtown Manhattan headquarters, jointly owned with Rockefeller Group Inc. The 48-story office building, part of Rockefeller Center, could fetch as much as $600 million, according to real estate sources.    Several New York-based companies have put Manhattan office buildings up for sale in recent months. As previously reported, Exxon Corp. last week sold the midtown office tower it owns with Rockefeller Group for $610 million to Mitsui Fudosan (New York) Ltd. Bankers Trust Co. and Manufacturers Hanover Corp. also have recently completed the sales of office buildings they own.    The moves at Time's magazine group are part of broader austerity measures by the company's chief executive, J. Richard Munro, and its president, N.J. Nicholas. The two are said by company executives to view cost-cutting measures as crucial to lessening Time's vulnerability to a hostile takeover. Though Wall Street executives say Time isn't in any imminent danger, the company has been the focus of rumors and speculation recently among players in the takeover game who believe the stock to be undervalued. &quot;The attitude here is that if we don't do it ourselves, some corporate raider will try to do it for us,&quot; said a high-level Time executive.    That concern is being communicated directly to the rank and file at Time. Magazine group officials and editors have met with their staffs in recent days to discuss the need for new austerity measures. &quot;We were told that we have to make cost consciousness part of our corporate culture and do some of the things ourselves that an outsider coming in to the company to take it over might do,&quot; said a magazine group employee. &quot;The tone is that we are doing all this to preserve the independence of the company.&quot; Cost cutting can help insulate a company from the possibility of a hostile takeover by bolstering its stock price and improving its balance sheet.    Mr. Brack said he and the editor in chief of Time's seven magazines, Henry Grunwald, are &quot;co-managing the process&quot; of restructuring and chairing a policy group on the magazine operations. In addition, he said, Time's managing editors &quot;are very involved in this process.&quot;    Time recently signed a new union contract that gives broader protection to editorial employees based on seniority and allows volunteers to be used in the case of layoffs. But because of the structure of most of Time's magazines -- each has several layers of reporters, researchers, writers and editors -- there has been mounting concern among editorial workers that the cuts will strike deepest there. Mr. Brack declined to discuss any possible cuts in the editorial area, but said &quot;our basic values -- quality products -- are sacrosanct.&quot;    Time executives note that other divisions such as Home Box Office and the books group, which Mr. Brack previously headed, have already been restructured. By contrast, the magazine group has taken only limited cost-cutting measures and is generally regarded as the last bastion of lavish spending and high overhead at Time. During 1986, for example, it cut about 250 of the magazine group's more than 5,000 employees. Under Mr. Sutton, the group's development, circulation and promotion operations were considerably enlarged, and new layers of management were added.    Mr. Sutton last year named two group publishers, S. Christopher Meigher III and Robert L. Miller, who in turn added their own staffs, sometimes in duplicative functions. Mr. Brack said, &quot;I am taking a fresh look at that, too.&quot; However, he added, &quot;the two group publishers are very involved&quot; in restructuring measures and he dismissed reports that he plans to make extensive executive changes. &quot;I inherited a first-rate team of people,&quot; Mr. Brack said.    Mr. Brack noted that despite the difficult advertising market in 1986, Time's magazine group's profit in the first nine months was up 7% from a year earlier. But John Reidy, an analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., predicts the group's operating profit will be &quot;modestly lower&quot; than 1985's $189 million. Mr. Reidy said magazine development expenses for a number of projects, including Picture Week, Leisure, and Quality &quot;restrained results this year.&quot;    Mr. Brack said Time decided against proceeding with the monthly Leisure because &quot;it isn't appropriate in this kind of economic climate.&quot; He said Time doesn't rule out proceeding with one of the magazines it currently has in development. But Time staffers say the company is expected to continue to focus on buying magazines rather than starting new ones.    Mr. Brack said that despite any cutbacks, the company is &quot;first and foremost interested in growth&quot; and is focusing on improving results at its existing magazines and in digesting recent acquisitions. As previously reported, Time recently formed a joint venture with Working Woman magazine to acquire McCall's magazine, its first entry in the women's magazine field. Time also recently acquired a minority interest in a new magazine, Parenting.    Mr. Brack cited recent improvements in the outlook for Life, which he said &quot;has the largest growth potential,&quot; and at Discover magazine. Discover, which recently acquired two other science magazines, Science '86 and Science Digest, &quot;is making substantial progress&quot; in advertising pages, Mr. Brack said.    Mr. Brack said future actions in the magazine group &quot;will depend heavily on what the experts here tell me -- there may be some areas where we should spend more money.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
