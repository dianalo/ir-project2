A record $5.3 billion of Treasury bonds were repackaged as zero-coupon bonds last month, or about 2 1/2 times the average volume recently. That has helped keep long-term interest rates lower than they otherwise might be, traders and analysts say. Zero-coupon Treasurys are almost exclusively bought by individuals, they say.    The shift by individual investors toward high-quality, low-risk debt corresponds with a dramatic decline in stock-market volume in recent months. Traders at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., brokers with many individual-investor accounts, say their fixed-income business surged well above last year's levels. That has helped offset big declines in revenue from stockbrokerage.    Zero-coupon bonds are created by &quot;stripping&quot; Treasury bonds of their interest-payment coupons. The resulting zeros pay no interest and are sold at a deep discount to their face value, which the investor collects at maturity.    Rising interest rates since last March have made long-term bonds relatively attractive to individuals with savings to invest, particularly last month when yields on 30-year Treasurys surged to about 9.4%; they were about 9% Friday. The trend could continue in coming months amid widespread skittishness toward equities, financial specialists say.    &quot;The public has made a choice to accept 9%-plus fixed returns as opposed to being victimized by another Oct. 19, particularly in light of insider-trading scandals,&quot; says Joseph Petri, president of Merrill Lynch Government Securities Inc. &quot;Our fixed-income business is two to three times greater than it was last year. There's no doubt about it,&quot; he added. &quot;If people weren't so scared about the stock market, yields on long-term Treasurys would be pushing 10% by now.&quot;    The latest surge in stripped Treasurys &quot;is proving to be a significant development in the bond market this year,&quot; says Susan Hering, a vice president at Salomon Brothers Inc. Looking at the big increase last month in volume of new zero-coupon Treasurys, &quot;it becomes clear that there may be a large shift in investment patterns,&quot; she says.    Most of the government issues that were broken up into zero-coupon bonds last month mature in just under 30 years, including the Treasury's 7 1/4% bonds due 2016 and its 8 1/8% bonds due 2017, she says. Salomon traders, who deal almost exclusively with institutional investors, say the growing demand among individuals for government strips partly explains why the gap in yields between two-year notes and 30-year bonds has narrowed to about 0.6 percentage point from more than a full percentage point in January.    The combination of tax reform in 1986 and a one percentage point rise in bond yields between March and August apparently helped attract individuals into zero-coupon investments. Even though they don't pay interest annually, such bonds rise in value each year as they approach maturity. Because the 1986 law taxes that annual increase, individuals pay taxes on income they don't get until maturity, or until they sell the bond.    &quot;But if these bonds are put into individual retirement accounts, there aren't any taxes,&quot; says Ms. Hering. &quot;When yields reached 9.4%, many investors viewed that level as attractive and put the stripped Treasurys into their IRAs.&quot;    The volume of stripped Treasurys also surged to $4.7 billion last October, but that bulge was due mainly to an asset allocation move by some big institutions rather than by individuals, according to Ms. Hering. At that time, for instance, Maryland purchased a huge block of zero-coupon Treasurys for its employee-retirement funds, according to state officials.    In recent months, the sale of stripped Treasurys to individuals has become &quot;the major business of wire houses,&quot; or securities firms that cater to individuals, says Jack Norris, a government-bond trader at Drexel Burnham Lambert Government Securities Inc. Despite reduced bond-market volume, &quot;wire houses are having as good a year selling bonds as they did in 1986,&quot; he adds.    Drexel, for instance, stripped between $2.8 billion and $2.9 billion of Treasurys last month, according to Mr. Norris. For individuals, the appeal of zero-coupon government issues is obvious, he says. A $100,000 investment in 30-year zero-coupon Treasurys stripped of their 10% coupon today would create about $450,000 of par-value securities at maturity.    Mr. Petri of Merrill Lynch says the increase in the firm's bond sales to individuals this year has helped offset a 70% decline in revenue from the stock market. &quot;So far, we've sold more than $7 billion of face-amount zero-coupon bonds in 1988,&quot; he says. &quot;We used to consider the sale of $30 million a busy day, but now we're selling $100 million a day.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
