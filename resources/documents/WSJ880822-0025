Aslami, a former executive vice president of SpecTran Corp.    In a complaint to be filed in federal court in western Massachusetts, the agency alleges that Aslami sold 20,000 shares of SpecTran's stock in March 1986, just prior to news announcements by SpecTran that it would face a substantial drop in revenue for that quarter. SpecTran is a Sturbridge, Mass.-based maker of fiber materials.    In a stipulation and consent accompanying the complaint, Mr. Aslami agreed, without admitting or denying the allegations, to pay the SEC $58,540 for the loss he allegedly avoided by selling the stock before the announcement, and to pay a civil penalty of $58,540, according to the SEC.    Mr. Aslami resigned from SpecTran in August 1986. He couldn't be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
