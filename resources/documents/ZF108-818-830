Indeed, with fewer than a dozenlines I was able to write an Actor Windows program that would have taken over100 lines in C. The Actor code performs so well that you will probably onlyneed to use C for the most time-critical tasks.andM;While Actor has been a Windows-based product since its inception, Version 3.0is designed specifically for Windows 3.0.andP;  With it, you can buildapplications of up to 2MB in size and run under any of Windows 3.0'soperating modes.andP;  It also offers class library support for Windows 3.0hierarchical menus and combo boxes, as well as inheriting the features ofearlier versions.andM;For instance, Actor offers a memory-swapping technology that allows a programto run In as little as 640K (with or without expanded or extended memory),while remaining application-transparent.andM;It includes a facility for calling Windows dynamic link libraries (DLLs),custom error-handling, user-defined primitives (written in C or Assembler),plus a host of new object classes.andM;The tools provided include a Class Browser for creating, viewing, and editingclasses, and an Inspector for viewing and modifying object instancevariables.andP;  An integrated source code Debugger pops up when an error occurs(and can resume once you've corrected the error), and a Profiler is availablefor identifying program bottlenecks.andP;  The full source code for these tools isincluded in the package, and-best of all-there are no royalties onapplications written in Actor.andM;Unlike recent entries, such as Asymetrix ToolBook, that give nonprogrammersan object-oriented environment, Actor is decidedly not for end users or evenpower users.andP;  It's a professional's tool, replete with the complex facilitiesand the terseness that they expect.andP;  It may take you longer to develop anapplication with Actor than with ToolBook, but the level of complexity andvariety that Actor can manage is greater by an order of magnitude.andM;Actor is a mature system, but it's not without its problems.andP;  This is asingle-source language, although The White-water Group does offer trainingand support.andP;  The class libraries are so complete that it may take longerthan expected to familiarize yourself with its intricacies.andP;  Also, while thelanguage is syntactically similar to C or Pascal, it's more complex andobscure than C + .andP;  Fortunately, a subset of the classes allows you to beproductive before you master the system.andM;Overall, Actor remains the professional's best alternative to writing Windowscode in C or Pascal.andP;  While some have suggested that previous versions werebest used as fast prototyping tools, Actor 3.0 offers the most completeobject-oriented programming system for Windows 3.0.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
