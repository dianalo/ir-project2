Jefferson (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> PCG DUK </CO><IN> UTI TNM </IN><TEXT>   Pacific Gas andamp; Electric Co. withdrew its proposal to acquire the neighboring Sacramento Municipal Utility District for an estimated $1.5 billion.    San Francisco-based PGandamp;E, in a letter to the utility district, known as SMUD, indicated that it wasn't interested in joining with SMUD and Charlotte, N.C.-based Duke Power Co. in the ownership and operation of Rancho Seco, SMUD's troubled nuclear power plant. PGandamp;E had intended to shut down Rancho Seco as part of the acquisition.    The PGandamp;E letter said SMUD failed to &quot;give serious consideration&quot; to the PGandamp;E offer. The letter indicated that SMUD is considering a separate transaction with Duke Power Co.    However, SMUD, in a prepared statement, said it had tried unsuccessfully to obtain specific details from PGandamp;E about its proposal. &quot;Based on available information, it is clear that a consolidation with PGandamp;E doesn't offer the rate protection found with the other options now under study&quot; the utility district said.    A Duke spokeswoman said the North Carolina utility had no direct knowledge of PGandamp;E's announcement. She said Duke was continuing to talk to SMUD about the possibility of Duke and a Western utility forming a holding company to buy Rancho Seco and lease SMUD's other generating and transmission facilities.    PGandamp;E is one of a number of Western companies Duke has talked to about joining with it in acquiring the SMUD plant, the Duke spokeswoman said.    As previously reported, Duke has been considering buying or leasing the idle Rancho Seco nuclear plant, the utility district's main generating station. Operations at the plant have been halted since an emergency shutdown in December 1985.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, PGandamp;E stock closed at $16.375, down 25 cents.    Barry Abramson, a utility analyst with Prudential-Bache Capital Funding, said that SMUD perhaps liked Duke's proposal better because Duke would reopen Rancho Seco. &quot;Maybe SMUD felt they had already invested money in Rancho Seco over the years and why abandon it?&quot;    PGandamp;E sought to buy the facilities of SMUD -- one of the nation's largest customer-owned utilties -- in part to prevent the restart of Rancho Seco. PGandamp;E currently sells SMUD about half the utility district's power. But if Rancho Seco were to restart, PGandamp;E could be forced to buy all of the nuclear plant's surplus power, under a contract that ends in 1989.    Analysts have also suggested that a history of animosity between PGandamp;E and SMUD may have played a role. SMUD was spawned by a revolt against PGandamp;E. It took some of the investor-owned utility's territory in 1947 after a long-bitter battle. </TEXT></DOC>
