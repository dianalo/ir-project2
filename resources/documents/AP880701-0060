The bill was approved Thursday by a narrow 13-11 vote of theHouse Energy and Commerce telecommunications subcommittee, withmany supporters saying they would prefer the industry work out itsown solution.   ``We are not convinced there is a true marketplace at work,''said committee chairman Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass.   Under the bill, approved 13-11, any cable programmer that sellsits programming to at least one distributor other than a cableoperator would have to make that programming available to all otherdistributors.   Congress has been concerned that some cable programmers havebeen unwilling to sell their programming to third-partydistributors, thus shutting out potential competitors.   But ``the fate of this legislation rests as much in the hand ofthe affected industries as it does in the hand of Congress,''Markey said.</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><HEAD>Voice of America Writer Sues To Publish Article Without AgencyReview</HEAD><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A writer for the Voice of America says thatshe should not be required to obtain prior approval from thegovernment to publish an article accusing the Reagan administrationof politicizing agency broadcasts.
