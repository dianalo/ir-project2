Some analysts think it is heading for a fall, but there are enough wild cards to trip up any forecast.    Since early August, prices of copper futures on the Commodity Exchange in New York have jumped more than 60% on increasingly heavy trading volume. On Friday, October-delivery copper traded as high as a record $1.465 a pound, though it closed slightly lower.    &quot;Traders haven't really panicked yet, but they're wondering how high the price will go,&quot; says William O'Neill, research director for Elders Futures Inc., New York. &quot;We've heard guesses up to $2 a pound, but that's sheer speculation.&quot;    What makes the metal run? Demand is outstripping supply, mainly because the U.S. economy keeps growing and copper is used in every electrical product from the smallest appliances to the biggest dynamos. As a result, copper supplies are shrinking fast, including inventories in New York and London warehouses. Strikes in Peru and political changes in Chile -- two of the world's leading copper producers -- make futures traders' even more bullish.    But two respected analysts have a cold-shower outlook. They predict output will rise and demand drop by the middle of next year. One says copper could fall to 80 cents a pound by the end of 1989.    Their forecasts have a familiar ring. They are pretty much the same as those made a year ago. They are also in line with traditional thinking -- that copper use begins to rise in September and peaks in February or March, then slumps in the summer when stocks are rebuilt.    But it doesn't always happen that way. This past summer, demand remained surprisingly strong and a variety of problems in Zaire and Zambia caused their combined production to fall 15% from a year ago. As a result, stocks weren't rebuilt as planned and supplies were tight when the fall surge in demand began.    Nevertheless, traditional thinking dies hard. While some traders are immersed in the immediate price boom, others -- including Michael Hughes, vice president of the Kidd division of Falconbridge Ltd., Toronto, a major copper producer -- are looking for the turnaround.    &quot;Whoever gets elected president of the U.S. will have some very hard financial decisions to make and this is going to dampen consumer spending and, thus, demand for copper-containing goods,&quot; Mr. Hughes says.    At the same time, he says, the U.S. copper industry has become &quot;lean and mean,&quot; reducing production cost to an average 40 cents a pound from about 70 cents to as high as $1 a pound in the early 1980s. Crushed into unprofitability by a mountain of surplus copper and expensive, antiquated refining methods, the industry turned to cheaper chemical extraction of copper and severely slashed labor costs.    &quot;That means the industry can continue to produce and make a profit, even if prices fall,&quot; he says. Additionally, he says, when prices decline, the attitude of the world copper industry is to increase production to make up in quantity what it loses in price, rather than cutting back output to boost prices.    Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc.'s London metals research unit looks at the future similarly. The firm's just-released annual review of the world copper industry foresees prices possibly dropping as low as 80 cents a pound next year.    Meanwhile, the firm says, &quot;the next few months will probably see the copper market remain strong and volatile since inventories are so dangerously low.&quot;    Shearson says its predictions can easily go awry. Its forecasted 1989 surplus &quot;is not especially large, so inventories will still provide only a feeble buffer against unforeseen events,&quot; it says. Its assumption that consumption will drop 1.5% could be more than offset by a usage growth of 2%, which &quot;is not beyond the bounds of possibility.&quot; For example, China's buying could surge, rather than simply grow steadily, Shearson says.    On the supply side, the firm predicts a 7.8% rise in non-Communist mine output and a 6.4% rise in refined production from 1988. But it says that while it has made &quot;relatively cautious country-by-country&quot; production estimates, it hasn't allowed for &quot;catastrophes&quot; or &quot;equally insidious disruptions&quot; of the sort that reduced this year's growth to paltry levels. These possibilities &quot;cannot be ruled out entirely,&quot; Shearson says.    Indeed, as if to underscore such warnings, Peru, the world's sixth largest copper producer, was hit last week by the second labor strike this year, paralyzing copper mines. On Friday, Peru declared a state of emergency.    &quot;The act is reportedly to provide police and army 'protection' for miners who want to continue working,&quot; said Bette Raptopoulos, senior analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities. &quot;It appears that it is intensifying the problem in Peru.&quot;    Two other potentially explosive elements could sharply reduce supplies and send prices soaring, says Richard Hirsch, metals broker at Gerald Commodities Inc., New York. One is the unstable political situation in Chile, the world's top copper producer, and the other is labor negotiations in the U.S., Canada and Chile.    &quot;Chile, following the recent plebicite that rejected Gen. Pinochet as its future leader, is a tinderbox that the slightest spark can touch off if he doesn't want to leave, or if he ignores the will of the people in some other way,&quot; Mr. Hirsch says.    The labor talks are scheduled to start in May. &quot;If the talks become difficult, they could create severe supply disruptions that would exacerbate the current tightness,&quot; Mr. Hirsch says.    Looking ahead to other commodity markets this week:   Livestock and Meat   Prices early this week are likely to be jittery in response to an Agriculture Department report released late Friday showing a sharp drop in the number of cattle being fattened for slaughter.    The government survey reported that the number of feedlot cattle in the 13 major cattle-producing states fell to 8.7 million on Oct. 1, down 5% from a year ago.    The drop is more than normal for the third quarter, which was just completed, said Thomas Morgan, analyst at Sterling Research Corp., Arlington Heights, Ill. Mr. Morgan, however, said he doesn't expect a sharp increase in futures prices since the numbers were in line with expectations.    Sugar   Traders are looking for confirmation of the long-predicted appearance of the Soviet Union as a sugar buyer.    Sugar-futures traders get giddy at the mere mention of the Soviets as potential buyers, but the anticipations have been dashed before.    Late last week, however, there was a spate of buying or scheduled buying on the world market that was attributed to Soviet bloc countries. Analysts and trade sources are wondering if it is a portent of a new wave of Soviet buying interest. These sources say that while the Soviet Union is expecting a large harvest of sugar beets, the sugar yield from those beets may be lower than it should be and could push the Soviets to import sugar.    As a result of this potential demand, futures prices on Friday rose higher than 10 cents a pound for the first time in a month; the March contract settled near the high of the day at 10.26 cents.    One analyst said the close was significant on a technical basis and could lead to further gains.    ---             Projected Copper Supply and Demand    In non-socialist countries (thousands of metric tons)                                          SHEARSON FORECAST                                        --------------------                               1987*    1988    1989    1990 Mine production              5,596    6,654   7,176   7,440 Primary refined production   6,517    6,635   7,060   7,315 Secondary refined production 1,176    1,275   1,250   1,250 Total refined production     7,693    7,910   8,310   8,565 Net exports to (imports from  Eastern Bloc of refined  copper                        (65)     (50)     25      50 Total refined consumption    8,010    8,130   8,010   8,000 Implied rise in metal  stocks (fall)                (252)    (170)    275     515 *Actual Source: World Bureau of Metal Statistics and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
