The campuses of Qinghua University and the China People'sUniversity bustled with students rushing to classes and picking upold friendships.   However, there were no overt signs of the activism of April andMay, when students boycotted classes to press their demands formore democratic government.   The student activists were at the center of a movement thatconfronted the ruling Communist Party with its demands for moredemocracy. Authorities finally put down the protests in June,killing at least 200 people and carrying out a nationwide wave ofarrests.   Since then, officials have taken additional measures to gaincontrol over the unruly student population.   Officials at Beijing University said first-year students at thatschool would be required to undergo a year of military training and``cultural studies'' before beginning their academic work.Previously, they were required to take only two weeks of militarytraining.   Universities throughout China have reinstated politicaleducation, which was largely ignored in recent years, in an effortto prevent more student unrest.   Most students went home for summer vacation in June, butgraduating seniors were required to take several weeks of politicaleducation and write essays of ``self-criticism'' before receivingtheir diplomas.   The political crackdown and arrests have had a tangible impacton the universities, which buzzed with political broadcasts anddiscussions last spring.   Pro-democracy posters plastered on dormitories have been scrapedoff. Bulletin boards now carry a few ads and class announcements.   During a boycott of classes last spring, students often gatheredto discuss the pro-democracy movement.   Today, the few students who lingered outside their dorms weresubdued and cautious. ``Everything's just fine here,'' one youngwoman. ``No problems.''   Upperclassmen at most universities in Beijing will return tocampus by early September, and freshman students will begin theirstudies about a month later.   Beijing colleges that led the student movement have had theirfreshman enrollments cut by half or more in a move linked to theprotests. Nationwide, the number of first-year students has beencut by 30,000 to 610,000.   Officials have arrested at least seven of 21 Beijing Universitystudents sought for involvement in the spring protests. At leasttwo have fled the country.</TEXT></DOC>
