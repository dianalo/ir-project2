The investigators, who included magician James (The Amazing)Randi, concluded that ``shoddy science'' but no deliberate fraudwas responsible for the inexplicable biochemical results, said JohnMaddox, editor of the British journal Nature.   The prestigious science journal published the results last monthalong with an unusual ``editorial reservation'' that noted the``incredulity'' of experts and said that the lead researcher,Jacques Benveniste, had agreed to the investigation.   The investigating team's report, released Tuesday, was based ona week-long visit this month to Benveniste's suburban Parislaboratory, part of a French medical research institute calledINSERM.   Benveniste said this week the investigators made ``an enormousamount of mistakes,'' and in a written statement he called theinvestigation ``a mockery of scientific inquiry.''   The Nature report and Benveniste's statement will appear inThursday's issue of journal.   At issue are results reported by Benveniste and a dozen otherscientists in the June 30 issue of Nature. The researchers studiedthe reaction of white blood cells, called basophils, when exposedto natural proteins called antibodies mixed into a solution.   They said that when the solution was diluted so much thatsamples of it no longer contained any antibodies, those samplesstill triggered the reaction in the white blood cells.   ``There is no physical basis for such an activity,'' Nature saidin its note accompanying the report.   The investigators were Maddox; Randi, a recipient of a MacArthurFoundation ``genius'' grant who is known for investigating unusualscientific claims; and Walter Stewart of the National Institutes ofHealth, who investigates scientific errors and fraud.   In a telephone interview, Maddox said Randi was picked to lookfor trickery, and Stewart because of his tenacity in investigatingscientific inconsistencies.   During the week with Benveniste and co-workers, they studiedlaboratory notebooks and observed repetitions of the experiment.The notebooks and observed experiments showed that results wereinconsistent, the report says.   The investigators, noting that the June 30 results have beeninterpreted as supporting homeopathic medicine, said they were``dismayed'' to discover that a French supplier of homeopathicmedicines paid the salaries of two of Benveniste's co-authors undera contract with INSERM.   Homeopathic medicine holds that a disease-causing agent, if usedin extremely dilute solutions, can be used to fight the disease.Its principles are not accepted by many doctors.   In a series of trials in which researchers followed specialprocedures to ensure they could not influence the outcome, theexperiment failed to give positive results, investigators said.   In one such procedure, investigators secretly devised a codethat identified the samples in each of a series of test tubes. Theidentifications were enclosed in a specially sealed envelope, whichwas then taped to the ceiling of the laboratory during theexperiment.   The day after that was done, Randi said in a telephoneinterview, the envelope showed evidence that someone had tried tolook at its contents. The attempt apparently failed, he said.   Overall, the investigators concluded that the researchers paidtoo little attention to preventing contamination and errors inrecording the response of the white blood cells.   Researchers also failed to explore why the experiment gavenegative results on many occasions, and excluded data from suchfailures in their published analyses, investigators said. Inaddition, some past results appeared to be questionable,investigators said.   Benveniste blamed negative results on the procedures he saidwere improperly imposed by the investigators and on overwork bylaboratory workers in the ``ordeal (that included) awful technicaland psychological conditions.''   Maddox replied that the added procedures were ``perfectlysensible'' and that the performance of lab workers showed noevidence of decline.   The June 30 paper also reported positive results from France,Canada, Israel and Italy. The investigators said they knew toolittle about the conditions of those experiments to evaluate them.</TEXT></DOC>
