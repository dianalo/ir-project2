Nazario   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>04/11/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B1</SO><IN>TOBACCO PRODUCTS (TOB)ADVERTISING, MARKETING, PUBLIC RELATIONS (ADV)</IN><LP>   California health officials are kicking off a $28.6million cigarette-bashing advertising blitz today financed bythe state's excise tax on tobacco.   The state, calling its campaign the largest offensive everagainst smoking, is the first to use cigarette taxes to tryto cut and eventually to eliminate tobacco use.</LP><TEXT>   The campaign will be funded by a voter-initiated cigarettetax passed in 1988 that added a 25-cent-a-pack levy to the10-cent tax already in effect. The increase was the largestever on either the state or federal level, according to theTobacco Institute, an industry trade group based inWashington, D.C.   But Kenneth Kizer, California's health director, said theindirect goal of the new campaign is savings to the public inCalifornia, where more than 29% of the men and 22% of thewomen smoke. &quot;The cost of tobacco use is staggering,&quot; Dr.Kizer said, adding that more than 30,000 Californians dieeach year from smoking-related diseases. &quot;On top of thatcarnage, smoking costs the citizens of this state more than$7.1 billion in health care and lost productivity,&quot; Dr. Kizersaid.   One of the themes of the campaign is the alleged deceptionin the advertising done by tobacco companies. The headline inone full-page ad that begins running in the state todayreads, &quot;First, the smoke. Now, the mirrors.&quot;   And rather than capitalizing on data showing the dangersof smoking, as many anti-smoking ads have in the past, thiscampaign will often appeal to emotions and attempt to attackthe image of refreshment and status that tobacco company adshave created.   One television ad shows a smoky office in which a tobaccoexecutive, speaking to other board members, talks aboutrecruiting more smokers to keep company profits up. &quot;Soforget all that cancer-heart disease-emphysema-stroke stuff,&quot;the executive says. &quot;We're not in this business for ourhealth.&quot;   Another of the four TV ads shows a black youth singing inrap style: &quot;We used to pick it. Now they want us to smokeit.&quot; Another addresses the issue of secondary smoke. As a mansmokes in a kitchen and talks with his pregnant wife, sheinhales his smoke. Then smoke billows out of her mouth.   Ads in the campaign, developed by the Los Angeles-basedagency Keye/Donna/Pearlstein, will also run on radio and onbillboards, with some placed on MTV. The agency previouslydeveloped the TV ad for the Partnership for a Drug-FreeAmerica that showed an egg frying and compared that to theeffect of drugs on the brain.   Many of the ads are aimed at target groups where smokingrates are particularly high, where dangers are unusuallysevere or where tobacco companies have aimed their owncampaigns.   &quot;When you drive through the ghetto, all you see arecigarette and alcohol ads,&quot; said Paul Keye, chairman of theagency developing the ads. &quot;The ads are about exploitation.They are about genocide.&quot;   Some of the state's ads target teens, since 60% of tobaccousers start smoking before they reach high school. Pregnantwomen and specific ethnic groups, which have higher rates ofsmoking and smoking-related death and disease, also getspecial attention. Some ads will run in Spanish, Vietnamese,Laotian, Chinese and other languages, Dr. Kizer said.   &quot;We want the public to understand that they have been solda bill of goods, that they have been duped by the cigarettecompanies. We want to portray a more correct image of whattobacco use is all about,&quot; Dr. Kizer said. Cigarette packsnow carry one of four warnings from the U.S. surgeon generalthat state that smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease,emphysema and may complicate pregnancy or result in fetalinjury.   Most tobacco industry representatives have declined tocomment on the ads until they've had a chance to review thecampaign, though some state officials expect the industry torespond with ads. The industry spent millions to oppose theboost in cigarette taxes two years ago.   &quot;There isn't much we can do about the campaign,&quot; saidWalker Merryman, vice president of the Tobacco Institute. Hecomplained that the ads don't seem to be in keeping with whathe said was the voter mandate simply to educate youths not tosmoke. &quot;They don't attempt to educate anyone about anypossible health effects of smoking. They simply seek to makethe tobacco companies appear to be heartless, uncaring, evenracist,&quot; he said.   He also questioned if the ads would have any effect. &quot;Theyaren't selling a product. They are selling an idea: socialmodification.&quot;   The ads initiate a $221 million overall campaign to curbsmoking in the state. The state health department willdisburse funds to local health departments and public schoolsfor anti-smoking education, with additional amounts going tohealth and community groups.   The campaign comes as one more assault on the tobaccoindustry. In 1971, the federal government banned all radioand TV cigarette ads. Last February, another federal law wentinto effect banning smoking on all domestic aircraft flightsunder six hours. In addition, 28 states now restrict smokingin government workplaces and 16 states restrict it in privatesector workplaces, according to the Tobacco Institute.Moreover, since 1986, a handful of federal bills have beenintroduced seeking an outright ban on all cigarette ads.   In the past, the American Cancer Society, the AmericanLung Association and U.S. health officials have issued publicservice announcements about smoking, hoping that the mediawould run them. The state of Minnesota has run someantismoking ads using general funds, Mr. Merryman said.   The industry, according to Federal Trade Commissionfigures, spends about $3.4 billion a year to sell cigarettes,$656.8  million of which goes into ads. U.S. sales ofcigarettes peaked in 1982 at 634 billion cigarettes for $21.2billion. They're now running at about 533 billion cigarettesfor $37 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
