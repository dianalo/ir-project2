Mayor Teddy Kollek called the vandals in the capital's Arabsector ``idiots'' and expressed concern that their action might leadto retaliation by Arab militants and further fuel tensions in thecity.   In the occupied Gaza Strip, merchants began a seven-daycommercial strike after pro-PLO leaders of the Palestinian uprisingcalled for the move in slogans painted on walls.   The strike is to protest the Israeli collection of taxes fromPalestinians. Non-payment of taxes is a major tactic of the revoltagainst Israel rule.   The Israeli newspaper Maariv said today the PLO has foiledIsraeli efforts to block its funding of the uprising by usingIsraeli-Arab businessmen, international organizations andultra-Orthodox Jews to transfer money.   Mohammed Yaub Salhoub, 15, died early today at Mukassed Hospitalin east Jerusalem, a day after being shot in the head by troopsduring clashes in the Nuseirat refugee camp in the occupied GazaStrip, hospital officials said.   The army confirmed the death but said it was checking thecircumstances.   The death brought to 352 the number of Palestinians killed in the13-month uprising. Fifteen Israelis have also died in the unrest.   The monument to soldiers of the Arab Legion outside theRockefeller Museum was partially smashed, said police spokesman AlexLapidot. He said police had no suspects.   An anonymous caller told Israel army radio the monument wasdamaged by ``lovers of the land of Israel and the Jewish people.''   The caller said the attack was carried out to protest thedismantling by troops two days ago of a monument erected by Jewishsettlers in honor of an Israeli taxi driver slain in the West Bank.   Settlers have vowed to erect additional monuments to Jews killedin the occupied lands in defiance of an army ban.   ``The people who did this are stupid, they are idiots,'' saidKollek. He said the city would offer to repair the monument.   Police imposed a curfew in east Jerusalem's Silwan neighborhoodafter they arrested 14 people, including nine said to be firebombthrowers.   It was only the third time a curfew was clamped on a Jerusalemneighborhood during the uprising. Curfews are a frequent measure ofcontrol and punishment in the occupied lands.   In a newspaper interview published today, Prime Minister YitzhakShamir accused the United States of prolonging the uprising byopening a dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization lastmonth.   ``It gave a great push and great encouragement to people whoperhaps had reached a point where they were considering desistingfrom this way (the uprising),'' he was quoted as saying in theJerusalem Post.   The United States ended a 13-year ban on contacts with the PLOafter its chief, Yasser Arafat, last month renounced terrorism andrecognized Israel's right to exist.   The Maariv newspaper and Palestinian journalists said the closingof Arab banks and limits put on money Palestinians can bring intoIsrael have not halted PLO funding of the uprising.   Maariv said a fringe group of ultra-Orthodox Jews, who believethe state of Israel cannot exist until the coming of the Messiah,transfer money to Palestinian activists, but demand a 25 percent feefor religious seminaries.   It said Arab public figures from northern Israel and Israeli-Arabbusinessmen belonging to the Islamic Opposition Movement have pumpedmillions of dollars into the uprising by laundering money throughlegitimate businesses.   Also today, Palestinian notables considered moderates confirmedthey met earlier this week in Jerusalem with leaders of the AmericanIsrael Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), a pro-Israel lobby inWashington that has spearheaded the fight to block the PLO'sdiplomatic gains.   The meeting took place at the Jerusalem residence of U.S. ConsulPhilip Wilcox and also included PLO supporters, said one of theparticipants, West Bank lawyer Jonathan Kuttab.   Kuttab said such meetings are useful because only staunchsupporters of Israel, such as AIPAC, could eventually persuadeIsraeli leaders to drop their resistance to talks with the PLO.   ``The only people who can change Israel's views are friends likeAIPAC,'' he said. ``Criticism from any other source could reinforceIsrael's paranoia and fears.''</TEXT></DOC>
