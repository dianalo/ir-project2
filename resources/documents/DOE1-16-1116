From the outset of the study, we soughta blanket design that enabled us to achieve the lowest possible costof electricity (COE) while maintaining engineering credibility and emphasizingpassive/inherent safety. Accordingly, four candidate blankets were selectedfor study during the project. Each blanket was independently configuredby a separate advocacy group with the intention of selecting the bestblanket for the final reactor design. The selection process encompasseda number of criteria, including economic performance, critical R andamp; Dissues, ability to meet inherent/passive safety requirements, vulnerabilityto the design-basis accident, waste disposal rating, etc. In this paper,we examine the comparison of economic performance.</TEXT></DOC>
