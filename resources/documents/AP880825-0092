SEWARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>JASTRZEBIE, Poland (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Riot police crushed strikes at threesouthern coal mines, miners said today. Other strikes continuedalong the Baltic seacoast but appeared to falter at a major steelmill, activists said.   There were conflicting reports on the status of the strike atthe Lenin shipyard in Gdansk, where indirect talks between thegovernment and Solidarity leader Lech Walesa were reportedly underway.   Strike spokesman Bogdan Olszewski said Walesa and 1,300supporters spent Wednesday night at the strikebound shipyard. Butstate radio estimated only a few hundred people were on strike atthe shipyard.   The Gdansk port, the country's busiest, remained shut down, saidreporters who visited it today. The government had claimed part ofthe port had reopened.   Gdansk's port director also issued an ultimatum that dockworkerswould be fired unless they signed statements that they are not onstrike by Thursday afternoon, state radio said. But strikers wereignoring the appeal.   A prominent Roman Catholic intellectual, Andrzej Stelmachowski,met with Walesa today as an intermediary to get talks started inthe strikes, said Adam Michnik, an adviser to Walesa.   Stelmachowski met twice with senior government officials beforecoming to Gdansk and his visit to the shipyard was approved,Michnik said. But it was unclear if he carried any message from theauthorities for the strikers.   The nine-day wave of strikes is the most serious to confrontcommunist authorities since Solidarity was crushed in 1981. Thestrikers are demanding legalization of the independent unionfederation, higher wages and better working conditions.   Activists said strikes continued at seven mines in the coal-richsouthern region of Silesia and in the Baltic port of Szczecin.   At the Nowa Huta steel mill outside Krakow, a strike continuedbut had weakened since Wednesday, when about 1,000 employeesstopped work, said Maciej Mach, an activist at the plant. NowaHuta, which has 30,000 employees, was the scene of a major strikein May during the last wave of labor unrest. A police raid endedthe previous stoppage.   Police completely cleared strikers from the Borynia mine inJastrzebie and the Morcinek mine in nearby Koszyce during thenight, according to workers from both mines. All strikers wereevicted from the nearby Moszczenica mine except 40 who managed toelude police and descended into the mine shaft with bread andlanterns, witnesses said.   The state-run news agency PAP, in a brief dispatch, said miners``left the mine'' at Morcinek and also reported the strike endingat Borynia. It did not mention the Moszczenica mine.   ``I was convinced the police would just try to intimidate us andnot rush us, but it didn't turn out that way,'' said FrancinekCichon, a member of the Morcinek strike committee.   He said police detained Andrzej Andrzejczak, leader of theMorcinek strike committee, and beat at least six men at the Boryniamine and an unspecified number at the Morcinek mine. He said nonerequired hospitalization.   The raid at the Borynia mine began shortly after a column ofabout 100 police vehicles entered Jastrzebie, Cichon said.   One striker said at least 30 vehicles blocked the mine's maingate. The miners then linked arms, sat down and began to singhymns, said the man, who refused to give his name.   Riot troops ordered strikers to leave, but the miners did notbudge until the troopers began to drag them out by their clothes,the miner said. Police herded men into waiting buses and drove themhome, he said. Management told men to return to work Friday.   Government spokesman Ryszard Straus said all but a few strikersleft the Moszczenica mine and that the mine was working. He saidabout 20 strikers were still inside.   No action was taken at three other mines on strike in Jastrzebie_ the July Manifesto, 30 Years of People's Poland and theJastrzebie Mine, activists said. Before the raids, labor leaderssaid the docks, shipyards and 10 coal mines were occupied bystrikers. PAP said eight mines were affected.   The strikes, which began with a walkout at the July Manifestomine, have idled at least 100,000 workers at more than 20enterprises.   Strikes in Gdansk closed the last key division of Poland'sbusiest waterfront. Tons of high-grade export coal sat in rail carsat the bulk-loading terminal, idle since Monday.   Riot police sealed off strikebound enterprises including theLenin shipyard, where the strike began Monday.</TEXT></DOC>
