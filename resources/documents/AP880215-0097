Elsewhere in the state, however, the wind had died down afterclosing major highways.   ``The winds are going down, but we're at a standstill yet,''said Lorren Simon, a dispatcher for the State Patrol in Marshall.   Interstate 90 from the South Dakota border to 10 miles east ofJackson, a stretch of about 120 miles, was still closed thismorning, Simon said. It was closed at 11 a.m. Sunday.   Simon said authorities were worried some motorists might stillbe stranded in their cars.   ``Finding stranded travelers is a frustrating process,'' hesaid. ``You can't use strong enough language on them. They'll goout anyway and then they think the public officials should come outand rescue them when you can't go up and down the road. They getreal perturbed when someone doesn't go out there. But I'm surethere are going to be people out there in those cars.''   Authorities said the near-zero visibility in the blowing snow,along with high drifts, made it impossible for rescue vehicles togo out.   ``All the roads are blocked,'' said a Redwood Falls policedispatcher. ``Nobody can leave town ... and I don't think anybodycan get into town.''   There were numerous traffic accidents, many of them withinjuries, but no fatalities were reported.   More than 300 people sought shelter overnight in National Guardarmories in Worthington, Redwood Falls and Jackso, said Lt. Col.Dave Pearson. Food was provided by the National Guard and membersof the community, 1st Sgt. Ron Balster said.   ``We lost count at about 212,'' said Balster. Travelers signedin from Iowa, Minnesota, South Dakota, Tennessee, Kansas andChicago.   `We got 200 furniture blankets from U-Haul,'' Balster said. ``Wegot paper towels from Campbell Soup. And people have brought in allkinds of food. There are sandwiches, chicken. One person justbrought in two gallons of milk.''   By 2 p.m. Sunday the Worthington Best Western motel wasdirecting travelers to the armory. ``Just about all the motels werefilled up by 3 p.m.,'' said Clayton Johnson at the Best Western.   ``We had 12 cars up here at one time fighting to get in the doorfor one room,'' said Lucille Thorn, manager of the Oxford Motel.   Worthington Holiday Inn general manager Connie Bruns said 75 to100 people spent the night in the lobby and meeting rooms.   In southeastern Minnesota, conditions were much improved todaywith wind still gusting up to 35 mph but with little snow.   ``There's some drifting on ramps and on side roads, but itshouldn't be too bad,'' said Bill Henke, a dispatcher for the StatePatrol in Rochester.   Conditions also improved in northwestern Minnesota and Minnesota2 was reopened at Crookston. Interstate 94 and Minnesota 210 atFergus Falls reopened Sunday night, said Dayle Peterson, asupervisor with the State Patrol in Detroit Lakes.</TEXT></DOC>
