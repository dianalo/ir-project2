But don't expect traders to be euphoric.   &quot;The currency market may be less quick to anticipate U.S.economic recovery than it was in 1991,&quot; warns Anne ParkerMills, a currency strategist at Lehman Brothers. &quot;Basically,we've been through that once before, and people got stung.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Still, most scenarios for this year are straightforward:After some initial weakness, the dollar is expected to rallyon the back of renewed U.S. growth and stable -- even rising-- U.S. interest rates. At the same time, slowing economiesin Europe and Japan are expected to lead to easier monetarypolicies abroad and weaker currencies there.   &quot;The interest rate differential between U.S. and Europeanrates will narrow, making the dollar more attractive,&quot;predicts Donald Mumma, head of treasury operations at CreditSuisse in New York. In six months, he sees the U.S. currencytrading at 1.67 marks and 133 yen. A year out, Mr. Mumma saysthe dollar will be valued at 1.75 marks and 140 yen, up 15%and 12%, respectively from the end of 1991.   For many traders and investors, 1991 was a year ofpartially fulfilled expectations: Initially, analystspredicted the dollar would drop to record lows; it did. Thentraders, believing a recovery and higher U.S. interest rateswere around the corner, sent the dollar soaring; they werewrong.   All this was played out against the backdrop of adisintegrating Soviet Union and a post-Persian Gulf War viewof George Bush as an effective world leader. By Dec. 31, theSoviet Union had broken up but not as violently as many hadanticipated. And President Bush was fading in opinion polls.   At the end of 1991, the dollar stood at 1.5170 marks and124.85 yen, compared with the 1.4920 marks and 135.40 yenwhere it began 1991. In between, though, the dollar rode aroller coaster.   After a brief January spurt, the dollar began tumblingwhen the Gulf War began Jan. 16. By Feb. 11, bearish tradershad pushed the dollar to 1.4425 marks, a record low.   Yet when it became evident the war would be short, tradersand analysts concluded &quot;that the U.S. would get out ofrecession and that U.S. interest rates would rise,&quot; says J.Graham Spiers, vice president in charge of foreign-exchangemanagement at Travelers Investment Management Co. inHartford, Conn. &quot;Also, there was a growing sense that GeorgeBush looked like a winner. That helped the dollar,irrespective of economic realities.&quot;   Analysts also began to recognize &quot;the costs of Germanunification, besides just the benefits,&quot; says Ms. Mills ofLehman Brothers. The rosier U.S. and poorer German outlooks&quot;together led to a dollar ascent that left everybodygasping.&quot; In just six weeks -- Feb. 11 to March 25 -- thedollar soared 19.4%, its steepest climb since the floatingexchange rates were adopted in 1973. The ride skywardcontinued, topping out at 1.8427 in intraday trading on July5.   From then on -- except for a brief spike upward during thefailed Soviet coup in August -- &quot;as the U.S. recoveryfaltered, so did the dollar,&quot; says Ms. Mills.   By contrast, the dollar's movements against the yen were abore. The Japanese currency's path generally mirrored that ofthe mark, but a lot less drastically. Analysts don't see 1992being any more exciting. Noting that Japan can afford tostimulate its economy and still cut interest rates withouttriggering inflationary pressures, Mr. Spiers says.   &quot;Japan is now more parallel to the U.S. in terms of policymix,&quot; he adds, and there are still &quot;political pressures tokeep the yen strong.&quot; In a year, &quot;the yen probably won't betoo much further from where it is now: 125-130 yen to thedollar,&quot; he says.   Against Europe's currencies, analysts see an economic anda political case for the dollar.   In addition to a U.S. economic rebound and higher interestrates, Travelers' Mr. Spiers says: &quot;The big move in Germaninterest rates in 1992 will be down.&quot; Thus, he forecasts thatthe dollar will &quot;bottom out early in 1992 and then go up 13%or 19% to 1.72 marks or maybe even 1.80 marks.&quot;   Lawrence A. Veit, an international economist at BrownBrothers Harriman andamp; Co., see other pluses, such as animproving U.S. trade balance with Europe. He also sees a&quot;portfolio effect&quot; boosting the U.S. currency. &quot;As the U.S.starts to grow again, the U.S. will be a more attractiveplace in which to invest,&quot; he says.   A dollar bull, Mr. Veit says that by the end of 1992, theU.S. currency will trade near 1.85 marks, up 22%.   Political support lies in Eastern Europe. &quot;This winter isgoing to be crisis time in the old U.S.S.R.,&quot; says Ms. Millsof Lehman Brothers. The short-term impact, she says, &quot;couldbe massive, given that day-to-day the people who controlcurrency movements are traders.&quot; But she cautions that &quot;thelonger the Soviet risk persists without anything happeningvery much that effects Western Europe, the longer we learn tolive with it.&quot;   Still, all currency forecasts are vulnerable to theunexpected. &quot;If Congress or the Federal Reserve doessomething that the market perceives as inflationary and U.S.interest rates show a negative real rate of return -- wherethey are below the U.S. inflation rate -- the dollar will getreal weak,&quot; warns Mr. Mumma of Credit Suisse.   While Ms. Mills sees the dollar at 1.651.75 marks in sixmonths, she warns that the U.S. currency could later fallback if the recovery is weaker than expected and the Germaneconomy is buoyant enough to preclude significant reductionsin German interest rates.   &quot;Exchange-rate forecasts a year from now are a relativelylow-value operation,&quot; Ms. Mills cautions. &quot;You are trying toforecast a turning point in the U.S. economy, a turning pointin the German economy, the U.S. election, and the course ofevents in the {former} Soviet Union.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
