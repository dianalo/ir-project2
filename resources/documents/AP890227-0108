Harry Oppenheimer, 80-year-old former chairman of the AngloAmerican Corp, mining conglomerate, said in a speech the governmentmust abandon its cautious, piecemeal approach to reform and stoptrying to appease right-wing whites.   He said foreign countries would respond favorably to ``a boldcommitment to consistent, long-range reform.''   ``Disagreeable though it may be, we must admit that the racialpolicy which has been pursued here over the last 40 years has madeSouth Africa stink in the nostrils of decent, humane people aroundthe world,'' he said.   Oppenheimer said South Africa's disenfranchised black majoritywill reject the free enterprise system ``unless they are enabled toshare to the full in the great benefits it can bring. That iscertainly not the case today.''   ``The immediate need therefore is to open the economy in a fairand equal way to all South Africans,'' he said. ``That calls,amongst other things, for the repeal of the Group Areas Act,'' whichmandates racial segregation of residential areas.   In other developments Monday:   _ Lawyers and civil rights workers said about 80 detainees havebeen released in the 10 days since Law and Order Minister AdriaanVlok held negotiations to resolve a widespread hunger strike.

Four hunger strikers who had been admitted to JohannesburgHospital were released Monday, but they told reporters they had beenplaced under restrictions barring them from political activity andrequiring them to be in their homes at night.   Most of the more than 300 hunger strikers suspended their fastpending an assessment of the government's response. But lawyers saysome detainees in Natal Province are continuing the strike,demanding to be freed or charged.   _ Blacks living around the mining town of Carletonville began aboycott of white-owned shops to protest a resegregation campaign bythe town council.   Councilors of the extreme-right Conservative Party, which tookpower in a local election in October, have reinstated``whites-only'' status at local parks and plan to build a fence tokeep blacks off the town hall's lawn.   White businessmen in Carletonville, worried about the effects ofa boycott, met Monday to discuss ways of reversing the council'saction.
