It was the first such challenge since the U.S.-Canada freetrade agreement took effect Jan. 1, 1989. The panel, known asan extraordinary challenge committee, consisted of tworetired Canadian judges and one U.S. judge.</LP><TEXT>   The judges unanimously agreed that there was no basis forthe challenge. The appeal became a contentious issue betweenCanada and the U.S. The Canadian government claimed thatWashington, by making the challenge, was abusing the appealprocedure of the U.S.-Canada free trade agreement.   The judges' finding requires the U.S. to remove acountervailing duty of three U.S. cents a pound on Canadianpork exports to the U.S. It also requires the U.S. to refund21 million Canadian dollars (US$18.4 million) in dutiesalready paid.   Tom Smith, president of the Canadian Pork Council, anindustry group, said the ruling should give a boost toCanada's 30,000 pork producers. He estimated that Canadianpork production declined 5% in 1990, partly because of theimpact of the duties.   &quot;It's undermined our industry pretty dramatically,&quot; Mr.Smith said. &quot;But from here on now it's a road back up.&quot; Hepredicted that Canadian pork production will return to higherlevels in about a year.   John Hardin, president of the U.S. National Pork ProducersCouncil, an industry group, said the council will continue tomonitor Canadian pork imports. If subsidized Canadian importsincrease sharply, the U.S. pork industry will considerinitiating further trade actions, he warned.   The pork case is the biggest trade matter to be handledunder the dispute settlement procedures of the free tradeagreement. Canadian pork exports are expected to total aboutC$400 million this year, or about 3% of the U.S. market.   The challenge concerned a ruling by a panel of U.S. andCanadian trade experts. Such panels are now routinelyestablished under the free trade agreement to deal with tradedisputes between the two countries. In the pork case, a tradepanel ruled that the U.S. International Trade Commissiondidn't support with adequate evidence its finding thatCanadian pork exports to the U.S. were threatening to injurethe U.S. pork industry.   The free trade agreement also provides for anextraordinary challenge committee to review trade paneldecisions in exceptional circumstances. The U.S. NationalPork Producers Council alleged that the trade panel, in itsruling, had exceeded its jurisdiction and petitioned the U.S.government to request such a challenge.   Canadian Trade Minister Michael Wilson said the judges'finding &quot;confirms the Canadian government's position that theextraordinary challenge procedure isn't an appeal procedureand is to be used only in truly extraordinary cases.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
