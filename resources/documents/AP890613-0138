He said two uniformed police and three plainclothesmen burst inon the crew without warning Monday night.   ``They swept aside a curtain and were confronted by us with ourcamera, two big lights, a mike man with a boom,'' Litke said. ``Theylooked very surprised.''   The three-member crew and its government-assigned interpreterwere held for about 2{ hours, Litke said, adding that the Chinesefamily was not arrested and no videotape was confiscated.   More than 50 foreign journalists are in Shanghai, China's largestcity, covering events in the aftermath of the June 3-4 shootings ofpro-democracy protesters in Beijing.   The largest demonstration in the country since the Beijingcrackdown drew 50,000 people in Shanghai on Friday, but with thehighly publicized arrests of labor leaders and some students overthe weekend, protesters have disappeared from Shanghai's streets.   Litke said police who detained the ABC crew ``were very cordial,but they would not let us leave. The family looked a mixture ofnervous, frightened and sad.''   The police took away the ABC interpreter for about two hours andtold him that ``we were all on tourist visas and breaking the rules,and if we wanted to work we must get permission from Beijing,'' saidLitke, who is based in Hong Kong.   ``They told him if we continued working here then we would begoing down a `dangerous path,''' Litke said. ``They never ordered usout, but when our translator suggested we might leave today, theysaid that would be a very good idea.'' He said he would leave forHong Kong later Tuesday.   On Saturday, British TV journalist Peter Newport was expelledfrom China.   Newport, of Britain's Independent Television News, was detainedas he photographed a protest by about 200 students in front ofShanghai police headquarters.   Newport has been the only foreign journalist expelled during thecurrent crisis in China, although reporters have been warned inBeijing and Shanghai that they cannot engage in news gatheringwithout explicit permission from central or local authorities.   U.S. diplomats in Shanghai were prepared to protest the ABCincident, but did not because the Americans were not arrested orexpelled, said William Palmer, a spokesman at the U.S. Consulate.   The Chinese ``are obviously watching very closely,'' Palmer said,with several journalists reporting being followed.   Only about 100 Americans remain in Shanghai and in theneighboring provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui, Palmer said.   ``We're still advising Americans to leave. We don't think itsadvisable to stay in Shanghai,'' Palmer said.   Also on Tuesday, the British Consulate said it has not receivedword from Chinese officials concerning Yao Yongzhan, a student fromHong Kong at Shanghai's Fudan University.   Yao was with British students and two officials from the BritishConsulate when he was detained Sunday on grounds he had notregistered with security authorities and was in possession of whatthe Chinese press called ``contraband materials.''   British Consul Ian Orr had not been able to meet with officialsof China's Foreign Ministry to discuss Yao's case, said Vice ConsulIan Cormack.   In London, the Foreign Office said it had told China's topdiplomat in Britain that Yao ``should be immediately returned toHong Kong. Any maltreatment by the Chinese authorities of the HongKong Chinese would have the most damaging impact in confidence inHong Kong.''   Hong Kong, a British colony, is to revert to Chinese rule in 1997.</TEXT></DOC>
