The council's action could renew hostilities between the two groups, which operated rival tours before a 1978 merger. That merger crumbled three years later, leading to an antitrust suit filed by WCT against the council. As part of the settlement of that suit, WCT got a five-year contract to stage six tournaments annually on the council's 75-event Grand Prix tour.    When the contract expires in 1989, WCT faces three alternatives, according to a source close to the company, which is privately owned by Lamar Hunt, one of Texas's wealthy Hunt brothers, and his nephew, Al G. Hill Jr. The company could halt operations, it could sue the council again or it could start a rival tour.    A spokesman for the council, a nine-member body including players' representatives, tournament directors and officials of the International Tennis Federation, wouldn't comment on the reasons behind the decision.    Owen Williams, chief executive officer of WCT, said the agreement was intended &quot;to bring peace and prosperity to the game.&quot; He added, &quot;Instead the council has now willfully set about attempting to tighten the noose on an already closely controlled sport.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
