Equations formass conservation, salt conservation and momentum conservation are formulatedin terms of the mass-fraction weighted average velocity and the massfraction of concentrated salt solution, and the underlying approximationsare considered. These equations are incorporated in the finite-elementgroundwater code NAMMU and applied to test case 5 of Level 1 of the internationalHYDROCOIN project. This test case proposed to model the groundwater flowover a hypothetical salt dome. The non-linearities arising from the densityvariation and from a velocity-dependent dispersion tensor made the problemvery hard: we had to use special techniques including mixed-interpolationfinite elements and parameter stepping. Starting from a related probleminvolving a large diffusivity we obtained a series of solutions at successivelysmaller values of dispersion. Our final solution is to a physically realisticproblem very similar to that specified. We draw general conclusions relevantto modelling these flows, and have built confidence in our numericalcode.</TEXT></DOC>
