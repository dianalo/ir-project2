According to the constitution, President Christos Sartzetakismust call elections within 30 days if political leaders fail toform a viable government that can win a parliamentary vote ofconfidence.   Constantine Mitsotakis' conservative New Democracy party wonSunday's election but fell three seats short of an absolutemajority of the 300-member unicameral Parliament.   The Panhellenic Socialist Movement, or PASOK, led by formerPremier Andreas Papandreou, came in second with 128 places and theCoaliton of the Left and Progress led by Communist leader HarilaosFlorakis took 21 seats.   The remaining three seats went to independents, including aleftist, a Greek Moslem and an environmentalist, for the first timein the nation's political history.   In the previous Parliament elected in June, New Democracycontrolled 145 seats, PASOK 125 places and the Coalition 28, withtwo seats going to independents. New Democracy and the Coalitiongoverned together for three months following those elections withthe sole intention of investigating scandals involving thePapandreou government.   The political impasse froze decisions on how to solve thecountry's economic crisis and negotiations on the continuedpresence of U.S. bases in Greece.   A Greek-U.S. defense accord expired last year and negotiationson renewing it were suspended in June. If no agreement is reachedwith a new government, the United States has until May 1990 toclose the four major military installations.   New Democracy party officials said Mitsotakis, 71, would conferwith Sartzetakis at the presidential palace on Tuesday where hewould seek a mandate to form a government. If he failed to do so,then Papandreou, 70, would be given his chance followed by Florakis.   The chances for the conservatives to succeed appeared slim sincePASOK and the Coalition said that differences with New Democracy inideology and foreign and domestic policy issues could not bebridged.   Leaders of the Coalition rejected Papandreou's bid to form agovernment after the June 18 elections ended in a hung Parliament.   The Athens Stock Exchange reacted sharply to the electionresults. Its General Index, which gives an overall picture of thedaily value of the shares traded, was down 8.9 percent for the day.   The sharp drop in share values reflected the anxiety felt bymany business leaders because of Greece's worsening economy whichcannot be revived without unpopular measures.   When the socialists lost the June vote, ending eight years inoffice, they had built up a $58 billion public debt, which included$20 billion owed abroad.   Mitsotakis campaigned on a program of less governmentinterference in the economy and closer ties to the United States.Papandreou pledged to double farmers' pensions and defend thewelfare state if elected.</TEXT></DOC>
