Some botanists at an agricultural research center here were tinkering in the lab. They spliced a corn gene into a petunia plant, and got an odd result: a petunia colored like an ear of Indian-red corn. Intrigued, they figured they'd try growing a crop of the strange flowers outdoors, in a nearby field.    That's when the fighting began. German environmentalists said the mutant petunias might spread, harming other plants. The strange color might confuse bees. Protest groups, like Women Against Petunias, formed. Demonstrators gathered in Cologne. At the capital in Bonn, legislators fretted. Regulators deliberated.    Today, the as-yet unplanted petunias are at the front line in Germany's epic battle over genetic engineering. The biotechnology industry, under attack by the country's powerful environmentalists, is at a standstill, with four factory licenses blocked. U.S. and other foreign gene companies are avoiding Germany like the plague. Local activists make political hay, and the press spins horror stories of mutant microbes and gene-spliced &quot;sheep as big as grizzlies.&quot;    What's happening in Germany is the drug industry's worst nightmare of how the global debate over genetic engineering might go. Gene-splicing in plants, animals and people is controversial everywhere. In the U.S., opponents lobby and sue to block what they call risky experiments. Last May, the world's first implant into a human of nonhuman genes took place in Bethesda, Md., only after a court fight.    In Germany, home of the world's third-largest drug and chemical industry, the uproar &quot;creates a cloud that prevents companies from making investments,&quot; says William Srigley, executive vice president of Invitron Corp., a St. Louis biotechnology company. Invitron is reconsidering plans for a $50 million plant in Hanover, West Germany. &quot;I have to believe Germany isn't going to give up its role in pharmaceutical development,&quot; Mr. Srigley says, &quot;but we can't spend our money to resolve&quot; the issue by staying and fighting.    Germany's emotional debate echoes throughout the international pharmaceutical and chemical industry. In Austria last year, gene foes picketed a cancer-research laboratory opened by Genentech Inc. of San Francisco and Boehringer Ingelheim G.m.b.H. of West Germany. At European Community headquarters in Brussels, German politicians under pressure at home are pushing for tough EC-wide gene rules that the industry claims would hobble it in world trade.    Because of the fuss in Germany, the industry hasn't had a new biotechnology plant licensed there in a year -- though the government has proposed controversial rules to end the bottleneck. The German chemical giant BASF AG has been vainly battling to open a biotechnology plant at its Ludwigshafen headquarters. But its foes are shrill. One local anti-BASF politician asked last spring: &quot;What killer life forms, what environmental dangers, what biological epidemics can we now expect if {BASF's} gene technology carries on?&quot;    BASF's plan was to make an experimental cancer medicine, tumor necrosis factor, using a now-routine process of altering the genes of a human intestinal bacteria so the bugs' innards secrete the medicine. The process, with minor variations, has been used world-wide for a decade to make many drugs -- without accident.    But in the gritty back streets of Ludwigshafen, a campaign began to block the plant as unsafe. Local members of the Green Party, which focuses on environmental issues, united with Communists. A local Lutheran parish played host for community meetings. Petitions circulated. Leaflets warned of &quot;horrific consequences for man and nature&quot; if mutant bacteria ever escaped the plant. BASF quickly countered, blanketing the town with its own newsletters. It treated town elders to a factory tour. But at a license hearing, Green lawyers successfully challenged BASF's application as legally flawed -- and the hearing was suspended in confusion.    Now BASF is hedging its bets. &quot;Ultimately, you can't do work that isn't approved by your neighbors,&quot; says Rolf-Dieter Acker, BASF's head of biotechnology research. So, though continuing to fight, the company plans to locate its main gene-research lab far from Germany's gene debate, in a more receptive setting: Boston.    The petunia fight highlights the contrast between U.S. and German attitudes. The experiment itself is garden-variety science that normally would attract scant public attention, except for one thing: It would be the first time anyone in Germany has moved a genetically altered organism outdoors. The U.S. has already had eight outdoor releases of altered organisms, some involving bacteria, which scientists consider riskier than plants. Ironically, even petunia foes now concede that the German experiment is probably harmless.    But a principle is at stake. &quot;It's the first {release}, and we have to stop it&quot; to prevent other, more dangerous experiments, says Norbert Barth, a young Green parliamentary aide. Mr. Barth is part of a network of mainly Green gene activists that has emerged in Germany since 1986. They don't have nearly so big a public following as Germany's powerful nuclear protesters; instead they rely on astute courtroom and parliamentary maneuvering to impede the biotechnology industry. Their main argument is: Better safe than sorry. Chernobyl, PCBs, Love Canal and other disasters began with inadequate knowledge of the risks of new technologies, Mr. Barth says. &quot;We should learn from our mistakes&quot; and halt most gene work until its risks are known.    Such talk riles Peter Meyer, a leader of the petunia scientists. &quot;They accept all the advantages of technology,&quot; the 32-year-old, shaggy-haired scientist says of gene foes. &quot;They get food cheaper than they ever have. They have unlimited energy. They just aren't prepared to accept the risks.&quot;    Ironically, his petunia experiment is so innocuous that gene foes accuse him of designing it to mock them. (He denies that.) He and colleagues at a plant-breeding center run by the nonprofit Max Planck Society, a big German scientific organization, plan to plant 37,000 corn-colored petunias near their lab to study how genes mutate during evolution. They expect a few of the petunias to mutate on their own, changing to yet another color. Those plants will be easy to spot in the field, and studying them may eventually help scientists control mutations in all crops.    The researchers cleared one regulatory hurdle last spring, but they are braced for more conflict -- possibly violence -- before next spring's scheduled planting. The petunias, Mr. Meyer says, have &quot;become a kind of symbol for genetic technology in Germany.&quot;    ---   Angelika Duval in London contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
