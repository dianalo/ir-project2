Stevens (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> EUROP JAPAN FREST CANDA </CO><IN> MON FRX PCS CMD </IN><TEXT>   Surging oil prices fueled a rally in sterling yesterday, while the dollar eased against most major currencies.    The British currency's gains came even though the pound had slipped earlier in the day on disappointing U.K. trade news. Meanwhile, the Canadian dollar rose in response to a report of strong economic growth in Canada and a bulge in corporate orders, traders said.    In European trading, the British pound was initially pressured lower on the release of worse-than-expected U.K. trade figures for January. Britain's Department of Trade and Industry reported that the nation's merchandise trade deficit widened to a record 1.51 billion pounds ($2.67 billion) in January, from 1.01 billion pounds in December.    The pound &quot;took a beating on the release,&quot; one trader said, and fell to its lows of $1.7680 and 2.9880 West German marks in midday European trading yesterday.    By late New York trading, however, dealers were flocking back to the pound, attracted by a rally in oil prices, Britain's relatively high interest rates, and a belief that the sterling-mark exchange rate had hit especially attractive levels. &quot;It shrugged off that bad trade figure,&quot; said Ian M. Spence, chief dealer at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., New York.    Sterling was quoted at $1.7740 in late New York dealings, up from $1.7720 Friday. The pound also was quoted at 2.9936 marks, off slightly from 2.9938 marks Friday, but up 0.2% from its intraday low yesterday, which is a relatively strong move against the West German currency.    Rising oil prices are considered bullish for sterling because of Britain's role as an oil exporter. Higher oil prices mean increased export revenue for the U.K., and boosts demand for sterling among importers of British crude.    Relatively high British interest rates remained an added attraction for traders yesterday. At 9.375% yesterday, three-month Eurosterling deposits were about three points higher than rates for similar dollar investments, and about six points above three-month mark deposit rates. Traders &quot;tend to buy and hold high interest-rate currencies,&quot; especially when the dollar is stable, said Geoffrey N. Gowey, vice president of foreign exchange at Elders Finance, New York, a unit of Australian-based Elders IXL.    The Canadian dollar climbed to 79.46 U.S. cents Monday, from 79.10 Friday, following a government report that Canada's economy expanded at a robust rate of 6.0% in the 1987 fourth quarter. The Canadian dollar's rise also was supported by increased corporate demand based on concern that the currency will rise further. The Canadian dollar should &quot;test&quot; the 80-U.S. cent level this week, according to Trevor W. Woodland, vice president of foreign exchange at Harris Trust andamp; Savings Bank, Chicago.    &quot;If you're a U.S.-dollar buyer, right now is the time to sit back and see if (the Canadian dollar) can break 80 (U.S.) cents,&quot; Mr. Woodland said. &quot;The Canadian dollar buyers have to be defensive. It's very hard in the short term to tell somebody that they should keep sitting back and waiting&quot; for the Canadian dollar to drop back down, he said.    In other trading, the dollar eased to 1.6875 marks, from 1.6895, and dipped to 128.25 yen, from 128.35. In early trading Tuesday in Tokyo, it was quoted at 128.50 yen.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose 90 cents an ounce to $430.50 in brisk trading. The estimated volume was 5.8 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $431.15 an ounce in early trading Tuesday in Hong Kong.    ---                   LATE NEW YORK TRADING                   Monday, Feb. 29, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
