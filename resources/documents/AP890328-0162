The hourlong speech in Dari, the Afghan language, was broadcastby state radio Monday night and Tuesday. The Foreign Ministry laterissued excerpts in English.   Najib called repeatedly for an end to ``Afghan fratricide'' andaccused ``Pakistani militarist circles'' of forcing the war on theAfghan people.   At least 3.5 million refugees have fled to neighboring Pakistanduring the civil war, which began after a communist coup in April1978, and the main insurgent groups are based there.   Guerrilla political leaders lead ``a lavish life'' in Pakistanwhile field commanders bear the hardship and risk of the war, Najibsaid.   He used the Dari word for ``compatriot'' in referring to thecommanders, reserving ``enemy'' for their leaders in Pakistan.   ``Dear compatriots, local commanders, I invite you to peacebecause I recognize you as the main party of the other side,'' hedeclared.   ``Before it is too late, please separate your path from thewarmongers so they do not take advantage of your blood and yoursweat.''   His continuing effort to portray himself and his government asIslamic rather than communist was evident in the offer to meet inMecca, Saudi Arabia, and his frequent references to the holy Koran.   Najib, former chief of the KHAD secret police, has tried for ayear to achieve a negotiated settlement. The guerrillas, known asmujahedeen, or holy warriors, refuse to negotiate with what theycall a ``godless communist regime.''   On Feb. 15 the last Soviet troops withdrew under a U.N.-mediatedagreement, after more than nine years of direct involvement in thewar. Najib's conscript army, well-supplied with modern Sovietequipment, was left to fight the insurgents alone.   Soviet supply flights arrive regularly in Kabul and Najib'sgovernment says they will continue until the United States andPakistan stop arming the guerrillas.   In his radio appeal, Najib said the Soviet departure left noreason to continue fighting. The guerrillas have said they won't besatisfied until Najib and his Communist Party are removed frompower.   For three weeks, insurgents have besieged Jalalabad, a strategiccity 75 miles east of Kabul on the only paved road to the Pakistanborder.   Kabul has been quiet, but heavy artillery could be heard Tuesday10 to 15 miles north-northwest of the city. Some of it was in thedirection of the Salang Highway, which runs north to the Sovietborder and passes through guerrilla-controlled territory.   Najib promised field commanders they could keep their weapons ifthey stopped fighting, and have their own territory.   ``My brothers, wherever you are, you can establish your owncounty, district and subdistrict and the state will act in thoseregions on the basis of your recommendations,'' Najib said. ``Youcan appoint your own government.''   His frequent comments about Pakistani involvement in the warseemed intended to rouse the centuries-old resentment of outsiders.Since the Red Army left, Najib and his government have increasinglydepicted Pakistan as the source of evil for the Afghan people.   At U.N. headquarters in New York, Soviet U.N. AmbassadorAleksandr M. Belonogov said Tuesday that Moscow wants U.N. militaryobservers posted between Afghanistan and Pakistan to stopcross-border raids by Afghan guerrillas.   Artillery or rocket fire could be heard and seen over a lowridge about 10 miles north of the Kabul airport Tuesday while threeSoviet Ilyushin-76 transport planes unloaded sacks of flour.   Half an hour later, a Norwegian plane chartered by theInternational Committee of the Red Cross landed with nearly fourtons of medicine, blankets and mattresses.   Alexander Lange, the pilot, said it was his fifth Red Crossflight to Kabul from Peshawar, Pakistan, since Feb. 15.   He reported no trouble en route, but said he flew his FokkerF-27 on a circuitous course that took more than two hours ratherthan passing over Jalalabad on the 45-minute direct route.</TEXT></DOC>
