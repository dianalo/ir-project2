Founded in 1938, the Chemical Fund grew to more than $1 billion in assets in 1972. It originally specialized in chemical stocks -- when chemicals was still a growth industry. Later it moved into a wide range of technology issues. But its performance often has lagged the market in the past decade. As a result, its assets have shrunk to about $670 million, even as newer mutual funds have boomed.    Now, Alliance Capital Management Corp., which took control of it two years ago, thinks it can revive the fund. In March, Alliance will ask holders to change the fund's charter to let it invest more freely in non-technology stocks. Alliance also plans to cut the fund's sales charges, then merge it with another fund and rename it.    &quot;We want to make this Alliance's flagship mutual fund,&quot; David Dievler, president of the Chemical Fund, says. Although a new name hasn't been chosen, Mr. Dievler says it will begin with the word Alliance and probably won't include the word Chemical.    It's still an open question, though, how much of a catalyst Alliance can be for the Chemical Fund.    &quot;Their strategy is do-able, but it's going to take time,&quot; says A. Michael Lipper, head of Lipper Analytical Services Inc., which monitors mutual funds. Alliance &quot;is willing to spend a lot of money on marketing,&quot; Mr. Lipper says, but he says its success in winning new investors is likely to depend more on whether the Chemical Fund can finally start outperforming market averages again.    Last year, the Chemical Fund was up just 12.6%, compared with an 18.6% rise in the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index, with dividends reinvested. Fund officials say that comparison is too harsh. They say the Chemical Fund is usually classed as a technology fund, and other technology funds averaged only an 8.2% gain last year, according to Lipper Analytical.    Currently, only 35% of the Chemical Fund's assets can be invested outside a broadly defined technology sector. &quot;That can be restrictive,&quot; says Mr. Dievler, who says the fund will ask shareholders in March to repeal that restriction. That would free the fund to invest in areas that Alliance currently finds more attractive, such as financial stocks.    Alliance also plans to merge the Chemical Fund with another mutual fund it owns, the Bullock Growth Fund, which has more than $100 million in assets. Mr. Dievler says Alliance would like to boost the combined fund above $1 billion before too long, but he won't set a more specific target.    Holders also will be asked to ratify a cut in sales charges to 5 1/2% from 8 1/2%. Although Alliance doesn't say so, the 8 1/2% fee may be deterring potential new investors, who can choose from an ever-widening assortment of no-load or lower-fee mutual funds. In recasting the fund, Alliance will institute a small deferred sales charge, known as a 12b-1 annual fee.    Alliance's biggest challenge, Mr. Lipper says, may be the aging shareholder base of the Chemical Fund. Many of the fund's investors bought their shares in the 1950s or 1960s and have hung on ever since.    &quot;These people are going to be redeeming no matter what,&quot; Mr. Lipper says. To offset their redemptions, Alliance says, it hopes brokerages will help it draw younger investors.    Mr. Dievler concedes that true comeback stories are rare among mutual funds. Of the many funds that have fallen from grace, such as the Manhattan Fund in the 1960s and Scitech in 1983, few have ever regained their prominence.    &quot;I'm hoping we can be a first,&quot; Mr. Dievler says.    ---   DOWN-UNDER BUYBACK: First Australia Fund Inc. last week announced plans to buy back as much as 15% of its shares, a move that could have favorable implications for investors in other specialized country funds.    The country funds generally are closed-end, meaning there is a fixed number of shares outstanding, and they are traded like stocks. Thus, rather than redeeming shares at net asset value, as mutual fund holders do, closed-end fund holders must sell them in the open market.    First Australia, like many other country funds, has traded at a sizable discount to net asset value. Its net asset value was $11.78 a share as of Jan. 2, but it closed on the American Stock Exchange at $9 a share that day. Buying back shares at the discounted market price will boost the value of the remaining shares, the fund said. (First Australia Fund, which invests in Australian stocks, is separate from First Australia Prime Income Fund, a much larger fixed-income fund.)    Investors welcomed the buyback and bid up First Australia's shares to a closing price of $10.25 by Friday, up 62.5 cents on the day, in Amex composite trading. Such stock-repurchase plans &quot;are a very good remedy to cure a persistent discount,&quot; says Thomas Herzfeld, a South Miami, Fla., broker who specializes in closed-end funds.    Mr. Herzfeld says he sees potential for similar moves by other such funds. Japan Fund, Scandinavia Fund and some others also trade at sizable discounts to net asset value. Japan Fund says it is considering a repurchase.    But Mr. Herzfeld says that although repurchases can benefit holders, they often aren't so appealing to fund managers. That's because repurchases shrink the fund's capital base, which usually means lower fees for managers. </TEXT></DOC>
