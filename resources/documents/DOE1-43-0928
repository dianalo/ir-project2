Thyroid nodules were diagnosed in 7.7% of the exposed and4.2% of the comparison group (prevalence ratio, 1.8; 90% confidence interval0.6-5.7). Autoimmune thyroid disease was diagnosed in 15.2% of the exposedand 6.9% of the comparison group (prevalence ratio, 2.2; 95% confidenceinterval, 0.8-6.2). No salivary tumors were detected. Two exposed womenand 1 comparison woman had primary hyperparathyroidism. Although absorbeddose to the thyroid could not be precisely determined, approximately60 rads would be expected to yield the observed excess of thyroid nodules.While the prevalence ratios were not significantly increased in the exposedgroup, the results suggest that susceptibility of the thyroid to nodulesfrom cumulative radiation doses of this magnitude could be increasedeven when the doses are accumulated over years and that such x-ray exposureof the thyroid gland may predispose the patient to the development ofautoimmune disease.</TEXT></DOC>
