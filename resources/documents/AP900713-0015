Having served a one-year stint as head of the U.S. liaisonoffice _ before there were formal diplomatic relations andfull-fledged ambassadors _ Bush fancies himself an expert on thecomplex land that has perplexed Westerners for centuries.   He doesn't appreciate being questioned about his moves on China,and especially resents the widely held notion that he is soft onBeijing.   ``They are wrong,'' was Bush's answer this week to those whodetected a double standard in supporting loans to China butopposing more than technical assistance to the Soviet Union.   ``The pressure is still on,'' he said during the Houstoneconomic summit.   Yet when it comes to China, Bush is feeling his way, lurchingfrom respectful deference to the leaders of the world's mostpopulous country to criticism of their record on human rights.   Universal disgust with the brutal treatment of pro-democracyforces in Beijing in June 1989 drove Bush into sanctions that hewas reluctant to impose.   He then joined leaders of the seven industrial democracies whoin July 1989 adopted a declaration freezing most loans to China andoffering extended visas to Chinese students.   But that same month, without any sign of change in China, Bushundercut his own sanctions by secretly dispatching Brent Scowcroft,his national security adviser, and Lawrence Eagleburger, the deputysecretary of state, to Beijing for high-level talks.   That trip and another in December by the two officials assuredChinese leaders that whatever their record on human rights, theUnited States under Bush would not seek to isolate them. After theuprising, thousands of political prisoners were jailed in China,most without specific charges.   At the Houston summit, Bush joined in giving Japan a free handto resume a $5.6 billion loan program to China. Also, the sevendemocracies authorized the World Bank to consider other loans.   At a news conference, Bush said those actions did not mean thesanctions imposed in Paris had been lifted. The loans the WorldBank will consider deal with the environment and with promotingreform in China, he said.   ``We have offered the hope that if they take further steps inthe human rights field, more can be done,'' the president said.   He said he wants China to move forward ``and I want to seerestored good relations with China, but we are not there yet.''   Hundreds of political prisoners have been released. But hundredsof others remain in jail. It is hard to tell how many, said AlanRomberg, senior fellow for Asia at the private Council on ForeignRelations in New York, because the Chinese do not keep lists oftheir prisoners.   Last month, the best-known dissident, Fang Lizhi, and his wife,Li Shuxian, were allowed to leave China after spending more than ayear sheltered in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing.   Romberg said Thursday that there are signs the Chinese ``willrelease pretty near everyone else in the near future.''   Romberg, a former State Department official, credited Bush witha policy that ``overall has been correct'' but also is far fromperfect in execution.   He faulted Bush for the way he handled visas for Chinesestudents. The president first vetoed legislation to permit thestudents to remain in the United States, then used his executivepowers to allow them to remain.   But Romberg praised Bush and the other leaders for maintaining afirm line against most bank loans to China. He said the decision inHouston to let the World Bank consider loans that promote economicreform was ``a modest step forward and not what the Chinese want.''   The Chinese wanted last year's summit ban on loans lifted.   Bush's next test on China will come in Congress.   In May, responding to urgent appeals from Beijing, he extendedfor a year what is called most-favored-nation status. That meansimports from China are not priced out of the market withartificially high U.S. tariffs.   Congress has until Aug. 31 to pass a resolution disapproving thedecision. At stake is $18 billion a year in U.S.-China trade.   Meanwhile, the House Appropriations and Banking committees havepassed legislation to deduct the U.S. share of any World Bank loansto China that are not made on the basis of basic human needs.   The outcome will depend on whether Congress can figure out whereBush stands on China and if that stand is considered tough enough.</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: Barry Schweid is The Associated Press' chiefdiplomatic writer.</TEXT></DOC>
