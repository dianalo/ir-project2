The South African Defense Force claimed responsibility in astatement issued in Pretoria 10 hours after the attack ended about2 a.m.   It described the victims as ``terrorists'' of the AfricanNational Congress, the main guerrilla group fighting whitedomination in South Africa.   Both the United States and Javier Perez de Cuellar, the U.N.secretary-general, condemned the raid. State Department spokesmanCharles Redman said: ``It appears the South African authoritiesmade no attempt to seek the cooperation of the Botswana authoritiesin dealing with the alleged security threat.''   In Gaborone, President Quett Masire's office said the man wasSouth African, two women were Botswanans and the third woman hadnot been identified.   According to the statement, all were sleeping when the SouthAfricans attacked at 1 a.m. in an area of the Phiring suburb calledTsholofelo.   ``The office of the president strongly condemns this dastardlyattack and murder of innocent people in Botswana by the SouthAfrican army,'' it said. ``South Africa's problems cannot beresolved by attacking neighboring countries such as Botswana.''   Botswana ``strongly urges the South African government to engagein meaningful negotiations with the genuine leadership of theoppressed majority in that country,'' the statement said.   South Africa's 5 million whites control the government andeconomy, and the 26 million blacks have no voice in nationalaffairs.   The statement from the South African military called the raid afollow-up to a shootout near the border with Botswana on Friday,which had not been reported previously. In that attack soldierskilled ``three suspected terrorists'' in a running battle near afarm, capturing rifles, machine pistols and hand grenades, thestatement said.   ``Following up on intelligence gathered during Friday'soperation, an element of the Defense Force killed four moreterrorists ... on the northern outskirts of Gaborone early today,''it said.   Monday's raid provides ``further evidence that ANC terrorists,originating from Zambia and Zimbabwe, use Botswana as a transitroute to infiltrate into South Africa,'' it said.   Defense Minister Magnas Malan said the ``pre-emptive'' raid``resulted in the prevention of killings and maimings of innocentpeople at a later stage.''   A dispatch from the Botswana Press Association quoted NormanMoleboge, the deputy police commissioner, as saying the fourvictims were shot and set afire, and gasoline containers were foundat the scene. It said an explosion may have been caused by a gascylinder in the house.   Neighbors said they heard sporadic fire from automatic weapons,and possibly grenade explosions. They reported seeing people fleein a vehicle and others run into the bush. Two said the raidersleft in a helicopter.   One witness said a woman ran from the house and sought shelterin his home.   South Africa has issued several threats to Botswana in the pastfew months, accusing it of harboring African National Congressguerrillas.   Masire's government supports ANC goals and allows itsrepresentatives in the country, but says it does not permitguerrillas to attack South Africa from Botswana's territory.   The South African military has raided alleged guerrilla hideoutsin Botswana several times in recent years. One person was killed inan attack in May 1986 and a raid in June 1985 left 15 dead.</TEXT></DOC>
