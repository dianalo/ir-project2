ActsTo Cushion ImpactOf Tariffs in U.S.---A Wall Street Journal News Roundup</HL><DD> 06/08/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> WNEWSCOMPUTERS (EDP)MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)EARNINGS (ERN) </IN><TEXT>   Toshiba Corp. of Japan said its American subsidiary will start making laptop personal computers in the U.S. next month in a bid to lessen the impact of punitive tariffs imposed by the Reagan administration on Japanese electronic goods.    At the same time, the company's Toshiba Machine Co. unit, which is under investigation for illegally exporting sensitive technology to the Soviet Union, posted a 45% decline in unconsolidated earnings for the year ended March 31 and said Japanese government sanctions against it will result in a loss for the current fiscal year.    Officials at the parent company said that Toshiba America Inc. will initially produce 5,000 laptop computers a month at its Irvine, Calif., plant and will expand output later. They said that Toshiba had been considering U.S. production for about a year but that the decision had been hastened by President Reagan's decision in April to levy 100% tariffs on Japanese personal computers, color televisions and power tools. The president was retaliating against Japanese dumping of computer chips in third countries.    Since the tariffs were imposed, Toshiba officials said, personal-computer exports to the U.S. have come to a halt. (In Venice yesterday, officials indicated that President Reagan was leaning toward reducing the amount of Japanese imports subject to the tariffs.)    Meanwhile, Toshiba Machine, in announcing an earnings decline to 1.29 billion yen ($9 million) from 2.35 billion yen a year earlier, also said sales fell 8.9%, to 102 billion yen from 111 billion yen. It said it expects to post a loss for the current fiscal year because of the Tokyo government's decision to suspend the company's exports to Communist countries.    Toshiba Machine is accused of illegally selling high-technology machine tools and computer programs to the Soviet Union. This breach of Western-bloc export rules is believed to have allowed the Soviets to build quieter submarines, making their detection by the U.S. more difficult. Two company officials have been arrested for their roles in the case and its president, Kazuo Iimura, resigned. He was replaced late last week by Executive Director Akira Iwahashi.    Toshiba Corp. is struggling to recover from the scandal. In an effort to placate the U.S., for example, Toshiba's president, Shoichi Saba, is using his influence to improve U.S. semiconductor sales in Japan, and a Toshiba spokesman says the company is increasing its own purchases of U.S. computer chips to 15% of its needs from 12% last year.    Toshiba has disavowed responsibility for its subsidiary's suspected illegal activities. Toshiba Machine is a &quot;completely independent company with an independent management,&quot; Osamu Iemura, Toshiba vice president, told a news conference.    Despite such claims, the Pentagon refuses to qualify Toshiba as a supplier of laptop computers and other electronic equipment for the Air Force until the parent company is cleared of liability for the unauthorized shipments. The U.S. Army also has to see the results of the investigation before it can proceed with a plan to buy a Toshiba-designed homing device for a possible new generation of shoulder-fired surface-to-air missile. </TEXT></DOC>
