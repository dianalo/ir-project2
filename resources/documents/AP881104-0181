Police increased security around the theater, but thedemonstration was peaceful and no incidents were reported.   The tumult over Austrian playwright Thomas Bernhard's new play``Heldenplatz'' _ or ``Heroes' Square'' _ has grabbed headlines forweeks in a nation that takes its culture at least as seriously asits politics.   The title, ``Heldenplatz,'' is the name of a large Vienna squarewhere Adolf Hitler appeared in triumph to an estimated 1 millionjubilant fellow Austrians after the Nazi annexation in March 1938.   Newspapers and state-run television have indulged in debatesabout the freedom of the arts, which are heavily sponsored byAustria's 7.5 million citizens in a country that sees subsidizedworld-class opera, music and drama as part of the national heritage.   During the first two acts of ``Heldenplatz'' Friday night, somepeople in the theater called out ``Outrage!,'' but the interruptionswere immediately drowned out by demonstrative applause in support ofthe performance, spectators said.   Outside, protesters conducted heated discussions about thefreedom of art.   Police officials said security has been stepped up inside andoutside the Burgtheater, a 100-year-old structure at the edge of theHofburg palace complex from which the Hapsburg family once ruled.   Controversy over Bernhard's play first erupted when two populartabloids published what they billed as excerpts from his tale of aJewish family that emigrated in 1938, the year the Nazis annexedAustria to the Third Reich, and returns to Vienna 50 years later.   ``In Austria, you must be either National Socialist orCatholic,'' one Jewish character was quoted as saying. ``Nothingelse is tolerated, everything else is destroyed.''   Another widely attacked quote said to be from Bernhard's scriptdepicted Austria as ``a stage where everything has run to seed,turned bad and decayed. A collection of 6{ million abandoned extraswho hate one another, 6{ million feeble, angry people whocontinually shout for a director.''   The storm of protest that ensued did nothing to hurt ticketsales. Friday's premiere sold out in half an hour, and tickets forthe next 10 performances are hard to get.   President Kurt Waldheim, whose own record as a German soldier inWorld War II has sparked fierce debate about the Nazi past,denounced Bernhard's play as ``a crass slander of the Austrianpeople.''   According to an excerpt from rehearsals broadcast Thursday onAustrian radio, the play at one point brands Waldheim himself as ``acad.''   Joerg Haider, head of the conservative Freedom Party, firstattacked Bernhard's play, then reputedly ordered tickets for thepremiere, sparking a running public argument with Burgtheaterdirector Klaus Peymann over who got the coveted first-night seats.   Peter Sichrovsky, a respected Jewish author who has readBernhard's unpublished play, wrote a long article attacking thedrama in Friday's issue of Der Standard.   ``It is a terrifyingly bad play,'' wrote Sichrovsky. ``Banal,polemical, one-sided, falsifying, stupid and dangerous,'' he added,attacking Bernhard's use of a ``synthetic'' Jew to attack Austria.   Neither Bernhard nor Peymann are strangers to controversy in acity that savors scandal in its world-renowned arts.   Bernhard, an award-winning author in West Germany and his nativeAustria, has been shocking his compatriots since 1955, when he wrotewhat was considered a scandalous article criticizing the hallowedmusical scene in Salzburg, native town of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.   Peymann, a German, became embroiled in fierce controversy thissummer after he denounced the historic Burgtheater, its actors, andAustrian politicians and cultural figures in a long interview withthe Hamburg weekly Die Zeit.   The actors in his troupe split into two embittered camps whosedivisions were barely healed before scandal erupted anew overBernhard's play.</TEXT></DOC>
