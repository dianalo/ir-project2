The White House, in a statement by Press Secretary MarlinFitzwater, praised the communique from the Arab League tripartitecommittee which called for a halt to the fighting and an end to portblockades, as well as a Sept. 30 date to begin nationalreconciliation talks by Lebanon's parliament.   ``These are essential first steps on the path to restoring astrong central governent in control of all of Lebanon's territoryand to achieving the withdrawal of all foreign forces, objectives weall share,'' said the statement from Fitzwater.   ``We call upon all parties to stop the fighting, lift theblockades and allow the process of reconcilation to begin,'' it said.   President Bush, spending the weekend at the presidential retreatin Camp David, Md., with his wife and friends, was in contact withhis staff on the Lebanon situation. He has been engaged in meetingsand contacts with foreign leaders on the matter, aides said.   The White House used the occasion Saturday to open the door for areturn of Ambassdor John McCarthy and the embassy staff to Beirut.The diplomats were evacuated Sept. 6 after Christian youths loyal tothe government of Gen. Michel Aoun, besieged the embassy compound.   ``The evacuation of our embassy from Beirut should not bemisread,'' the Fitzwater statement read. ``Our temporary absencedoes not mean we are indifferent to the safety and welfare of thepeople of Lebanon.   ``Indeed we redoubled our efforts with the Arab League to pressfor a cease-fire and the beginning of a political process to bringan end to the suffering in Lebanon.   ``Rest assured, the United States will return its diplomats toLebanon as expeditiously as we are convinced that circumstancesexist in which our presence can be reasonably safe and effective.''   The United States will engage in talks with Aoun's government onthe security assurances it would require before they return, said anadministration official who spoke on condition of anonymity.   Sources in Lebanon said Aoun considered the departure a movedirected against his rule.   State Department officials have said they considered Aoun's ownearlier comments threats on Americans. He had said in an interviewthat the United States was obsessed with freeing Americans heldhostage in Lebanon, and indicated perhaps the way to get theattention of the United States was to take American hostages.   The declaration Saturday by the foreign ministers of SaudiArabia, Morocco and Algeria, who make up the Arab League committee,was viewed by the administration as ``a clear step in the rightdirection,'' said the administration source.   Previous similar calls have failed to end the violence pittingSyrian troops and allied Moslem militias against the mainlyChristian troops of Aoun.   But the setting of a Sept. 30 negotiation date, and pledges aboutrestricting arms supplies indicated the effort was ``reasonablyserious'' and pragmatic and may have potential, the official added.   The Arab League, founded in 1945, is the chief representative ofArab interests internationally and mediates disputes among the Arabstates.</TEXT></DOC>
