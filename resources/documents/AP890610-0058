SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Voice of America on Saturday rejected acomplaint from the Chinese Communist Party, which criticized thebroadcast service for carrying a report that 3,000 residents diedduring the crackdown of pro-democracy demonstrators.   ``The VOA checks its information prior to broadcast to be surethe facts are confirmed,'' said a statement released by VOA newsdirector Philomena Jurey.   The People's Daily, the Communist Party newspaper, accused theU.S. government-backed VOA of being ``irresponsible'' in itsreporting. The newspaper said the U.S. broadcast was aimed atinstigating hatred and resistance.   At the State Department, an official who spoke on condition henot be identified noted that there have been ``many crediblereports'' of civilian deaths in last week's disturbances.   Doctors and witnesses have estimated that thousands were fatallyshot along the road and in the square, and U.S. intelligence reportshave estimated the death toll at about 3,000.   Chinese Red Cross officials estimate 3,600 people were killed and60,000 injured, according to the Union of Chinese Students in theFederal Republic, a Chinese group in West Germany.   Radio Beijing carried a report Saturday that claimed that in theprocess of clearing out Tiananmen Square, ``the Liberation Army didnot fire even once at the crowd of people.''   The Chinese government has said 300 died in the military assault,and most of the dead and injured were soldiers attacked by rioters.   In response to the turmoil in China, the VOA added threeadditional hours of radio broadcasts in Mandarin, bringing to 11hours the amount of programming beamed daily to China.   VOA director Richard Carlson estimated recently that the servicehas a listening audience of ``over 100 million'' in China.   During the unrest, said Carlson, Chinese authorities have triedto jam VOA Chinese radio broadcasts. They have not tried to jamVOA's English language broadcasts.   In response to the Chinese crisis, the VOA has also begun beamingtelevision signals into China, the first time it has ever taken sucha step.</TEXT></DOC>
