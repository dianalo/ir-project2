 You lead aband of special agents against a rebellion.andM;REVIEWandM;Centauri Alliance (CA) is a role-playing fantasy adventure game set in the23rd Century.andP;  The game comes on three (3) double-sided diskettes and isaccompanied by a star map that shows the part of the galaxy that is inquestion with the different worlds and the paths among them; a 54-pageReference Manual that tells you some of what you need to know; a 24-pageField Guide that fills in some of the holes in your knowledge and gives somemore background information on the story and the characters involved; aRegistration card; and a quick reference card for your use in the midst ofthe game.andM;The story reads as follows: In the 23rd century the six species of spacewanderers who occupy this sector of the galaxy get together and choose tostop the warfare between them and create a common alliance.andP;  Some forty yearslater, there are reports filtering in from some of the remote corners of theAlliance of some renegades whose goal it seems is to wreck the Alliance.andP;  Youare a part of a band of Alliance special agents whose job it is to figure outwhat is happening and why.andM;In the beginning your band of special agents is relatively weak.andP;  It willtake some serious fighting and snooping around the different worlds in thegalaxy to get your band of adventurers to become a powerful enough force, aswell as to collect enough clues, to be able to solve the mystery and beat themastermind that is behind this rebellion.andP;  To help you in this task, you aredirected to one of the worlds by your headquarters and given a specificmission.andP;  As you accomplish this mission you accumulate experience pointsthat allow you to be further trained in different arts and also give youclues as to your ultimate mission.andM;You control your group by issuing commands to them.andP;  Sometimes, you issuecommands to one individual and sometimes to the group as a whole.andP;  You issuethese commands by using a combination of the keyboard and some other devicelike a mouse or joystick.andP;  For instance, to move the group in the directionthat you are facing, you may either click the mouse button when an on-screenarrow points straight up, or you can hit the letter 'k' on the keyboard.andO;But, when you are fighting, you select the hex that you want to fight with bydouble-clicking the mouse.andP;  It is somewhat confusing to have to rememberwhich time you should do what with what, but after awhile you get the hang ofit.andM;As you explore the different worlds you encounter many strange beings.andP;  Mostall of them are hostile and must be vanquished.andP;  The battle screens requireagain a combination of mouse and keyboard actions and the graphics themselvesare not very good.andP;  In fact, you will frequently have trouble, in thebeginning, distinguishing between your good guys and the baddies.andP;  After yousuccessfully slaughter all of the bad guys in a battle, you are awardedexperience points as well as occasionally find useful and not so usefulitems.andP;  The experience points that you collect go towards each individual'sability and propensity to be promoted.andP;  When your experience points go downto zero, you are eligible for further training and promotion at the Academylocated on Earth's Lunabase.andM;After many battles the clues you collect start to tell you of the real storybehind the rebellion.andP;  I will not give the secret away here, but beforewarned that your real mission is not at all that which you were toldabout initially.andP;  However, you must successfully complete the initial missionto be able to accomplish the real one.andM;This game was designed by the same person that put together the &quot;Bard's Tale&quot;series of games.andP;  Unfortunately, this game seems to lack the richness anddiversity of characters and plot that the Bard's Tale series had.andP;  Thegraphics that accompany the game are annoyingly crude.andP;  The special abilitiesthat your characters can accumulate and use later on seem disjointed andstrange.andP;  And the whole game seems to have been hastily put together andreleased to catch the current popularity of this type of game.andM;This is the kind of game that requires many hours of play before you reallystart getting anywhere.andP;  Once solved, there is really no reason to try itagain as you already know all there is to it.andP;  In good games of this genre,the monsters that one meets early on are gruesome and fierce enough thatbeating them gives you a sense of accomplishment and the later monsters aremore fearsome and more terrible.andP;  In this game, due to the crude graphics,there is no sense of increasing terribleness as the same graphics are usedover and over and the only difference seems to be in the amount of experiencepoints awarded your party for surviving.andP;  I have enjoyed several excellentgames along these lines in the past and was rather disappointed at this one.andO;There just seems to be no real focus to the game so that it very quicklydeteriorates into a series of similar boring battles.andM;PUMA RATINGSandM;PERFORMANCE: 2  The game was relatively slow even when using the speeded upIIGS mode.andP;  There are parts where nothing happens for a long time like thetrips between different worlds that are cute the first time, but deteriorateto aggravation as you go through the sequence over and over again.andM;USEFULNESS:  2  A game is deemed useful by me if it holds my interest for along time or draws me back to it again and again.andP;  This game has not managedto fascinate me as much as other of its kind.andM;MANUAL:  2 The two manuals are somewhat poorly organized leading to a lot ofsearching for information.andP;  Some information is just not there leading tomany frustrating minutes of trying to  find it.andM;AVAILABILITY: 3 Available from mail order and software stores.andP;  Technicalsupport is prompt and courteous even though it is not an 800 number.andP;  I had adefective disk.andP;  Calling technical support prompted me to send it back toBroderbund and within a week and a half I got a new set of diskettes thatallows me to continue playing.andM;(Naor Wallach/19900529)</TEXT></DOC>
