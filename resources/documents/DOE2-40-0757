The study consisted of a literature search and enginetests using a dynamometer. The literature search identified materialcompatibility problems and possible solutions to these problems. Forthe engine tests, a number of gasoline/alcohol blends were prepared usingboth ethanol and methanol in varying concentrations and the vapor-lockbehavior was identified. Neat alcohols and methyl-tertiary-butyl etherwere also used in the engine, and special operational conditions andproblems were identified.</TEXT></DOC>
