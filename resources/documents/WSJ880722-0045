This week, the auto maker may have passed a similar milestone by securing Italy's first large-scale contract linking wage increases to the company's performance. Coming at Italy's largest company, Fiat's agreement is expected to set the standard for other private-sector businesses.    &quot;It shows that there's a lot of flexibility&quot; in the Italian labor market, said one international economist. &quot;It will have a very profound effect on industry,&quot; added labor expert Renato Brunetta. &quot;What's good for Fiat,&quot; he quipped, &quot;is good for the other companies.&quot;    For Italian industry, the news is especially heartening at a time when unions have been increasingly restive. In the public sector, strikes have hit the schools, air travel, railroads and city buses. Schoolteachers won a costly salary increase in June that threatens to throw the government's deficit-cutting plan off track.    Worst of all, the unions have lost control of some of their more radical members, who have held unsanctioned strikes even after the unions have hammered out accords. Observers here were anxiously waiting to see whether such tactics would spill over into the private sector.    The Fiat accord, however, was signed in only about a month, with few strikes and what Mr. Brunetta called a reasonably generous economic reward for workers. It also sets a standard for the rest of industry that doesn't commit companies doing less well than Fiat to give big pay increases, Sergio Pininfarina, head of the employers association Confindustria, told the daily Corriere Della Sera. &quot;It shows that we are no longer in the crazy 1970s,&quot; he added, &quot;when unions considered salaries an independent variable,&quot; not linked to economic conditions or those of the company.    Part of the reason Fiat succeeded where state employers haven't is that the auto maker since 1980 has a history of playing hardball with unions. Only 35% of Fiat's employees are union members, and the most radical Communist-led union has been losing ground to more-moderate rivals. Though far from revolutionary, Fiat Chairman Giovanni Agnelli's suggestion that pay raises be linked to factors such as sales, profits, output and quality caught the unions completely off guard.    Instead of a straight pay increase, workers this year will get a bonus of 1 million to 1.3 million lire ($729 to $948), roughly equivalent to an extra month's pay. It will be paid Aug. 1, just as their annual month-long holiday begins.    The union's requested pay raise would have increased labor costs for the auto maker 20%, a Fiat spokesman said. By choosing the bonus form of payment, he added, Fiat avoids paying 300 billion lire of social costs. In 1989, Fiat will offer a similar-style bonus, while in 1990, 1/12th the average of the 1988 and 1989 bonuses will be paid in workers' monthly paychecks.    Not everyone is happy with the accord. Only two of the company's three unions have signed the contract, although that is all that's necessary for it to take effect. The metalworkers unit of Confederazione Generale Italiana del Lavoro, which had asked for extra time to think over Fiat's proposals, was dismayed to find that the two other unions had signed the accord without informing CGIL, a spokeswoman said.    CGIL is by far the largest union in Italy, or at Fiat, though it now represents only about 15% of the auto maker's more than 200,000 employees. Commentators here attribute its embarrassing position to increasing dissent as unions jockey for power among themselves and as hardliners used to confrontation clash with moderate members increasingly willing to accept more-flexible work conditions.    The CGIL spokeswoman said the union didn't find Fiat's proposals &quot;unacceptable&quot; but wanted to gain more concessions on the way in which the bonuses would be paid and on improving the type of food served in employee cafeterias. CGIL officials were meeting yesterday to evaluate their position and what possible actions to take. </TEXT></DOC>
