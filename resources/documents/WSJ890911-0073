The comptroller of the currency proposed that national banks be required to hold at least $3 in capital for each $100 in assets. The 3% capital-to-assets ratio would come as a relief to the thrift industry, which, under the recent thrift bailout law, must meet the same capital standards as national banks. Regulators have discussed setting the capital floor as high as 6%.    Separately, the Resolution Trust Corp., which was established by the new law to sell or liquidate insolvent Sandamp;Ls, announced it intends to sell five more of the nation's biggest and most troubled thrifts. The five have combined assets of $9.3 billion.    Nearly 900 Sandamp;Ls, with $500 billion in assets, currently wouldn't meet the proposed 3% minimum. Almost 500 more thrifts, with another $500 billion in assets, couldn't meet a 6% test. Institutions that can't meet the standard will be required to devise plans for increasing their capital to the required level. The Federal National Mortgage Association plans to help thrifts decide how best to meet the new requirements.    The comptroller's action will make life easier for thrift regulators, who have been wrestling with confusion stemming from the new thrift law. The law calls for a 3% capital minimum for thrifts, but it also says regulators must make thrift standards &quot;no less stringent&quot; than levels for national banks by the end of this year.    One reason for the thrift regulators' uncertainty has been that the comptroller is in the process of changing from the current, uniform, 6% minimum capital requirement for national banks to a system that sets minimum capital levels on a case-by-case basis according to the riskiness of banks' assets. The comptroller's proposed 3% floor would assure that under the new approach, even banks with very low-risk assets couldn't hold less than 3% in capital.    The comptroller's proposed capital floor, which could be approved in December but wouldn't take effect until the end of next year, should enable thrift regulators to propose a similar standard in the next several weeks, as required under the bailout.    &quot;It clarifies things a lot,&quot; said Jonathan Fiechter, a top official of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which will become part of the Treasury Department and will be renamed the Office of Thrift Supervision in a few weeks. &quot;Now we don't have to guess what the comptroller will propose.&quot;    However, the proposal leaves unresolved a dispute between Comptroller Robert Clarke, who has backed the 3% level, and William Seidman, the chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., who believes that the minimum should be 6% to deter risky lending.    Under Mr. Clarke's proposal, only common stock and some preferred stock would count toward the 3% minimum. In recent weeks, he and Mr. Seidman have discussed a compromise 4.5% minimum-capital level, in which less tangible forms of capital could be counted toward meeting the extra 1.5%, but Mr. Clarke stayed with his plan, saying that was &quot;more complicated than it needs to be.&quot;    Mr. Seidman, responding to the comptroller's plan, said 90% of the country's 13,000 banks could reduce their capital with a 3% minimum. That could &quot;substantially increase the risk of loss to the deposit insurance funds,&quot; he said.    Mr. Clarke, who said he had the support of top officials at the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve, argues that a 6% minimum would be higher than most banks' risk-based requirements -- and thus would eliminate the incentive for bankers to hold lower-risk assets.    The disagreement raises the possibility that bank capital standards will lose the uniformity various regulators have maintained in recent years. Mr. Clarke regulates 4,300 national banks with about two-thirds of the banking industry's $3 trillion in assets. Mr. Seidman's agency insures deposits at all banks, but sets regulations only for the 7,000 state-chartered banks that don't belong to the Federal Reserve System.    The comptroller's office said about 800 national and state-chartered banks would have to raise capital to meet the 3% or risk-based minimum capital standards.    The five thrifts on which the RTC opened bidding are University Federal Savings Association, Houston, $2.6 billion in assets; Hill Financial Savings Association, Red Hill, Pa., $2.6 billion in assets; Pacific Savings Bank, Costa Mesa, Calif., $1 billion in assets; Peoples Heritage Savings, Salina, Kan., $1.8 billion in assets; and Freedom Savings andamp; Loan Association, Tampa, Fla., $1 billion in assets.    The size of the thrifts, the severity of their losses and the eroding values of their loans mean that the transactions will be costly for the government, which is acting as their receiver. The initial outlay of cash by the RTC could be as high as $8 billion to $10 billion before it recoups some of the cost through sales of assets.    Earlier, the RTC announced it wanted to sell five other large thrifts, and negotiations are continuing for those.    The RTC initially said it sought to sell the thrifts via simple transactions, in which investors would contribute 6% new equity and the RTC would make single lump-sum payments to compensate the investors for the bad assets left on the books by the institutions' former managers. But the RTC and investors making bids say the new agency now is entertaining offers for the thrifts' deposits alone, some portion of the assets or entire institutions.    Many potential investors have been skeptical that the RTC would be able to arrange simple, whole-institution sales without even greater government cash infusions, due to the uncertain values of the sick Sandamp;Ls. &quot;It could require more cash than they may have,&quot; said Gerard Smith, an official of a $300 million Salomon Brothers fund established to invest in the failed thrifts.    ---   Paulette Thomas also contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
