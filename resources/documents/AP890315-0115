(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Air Force investigators looking into ahelicopter crash that killed 15 servicemen are considering factorssuch as weather, maintenance and weight but have ruled out a suspectrotor fastener, a spokesman said.   The CH-3E ``Jolly Green Giant'' helicopter, carrying 11 GreenBerets engaged in desert training and four Air Force crewmen,crashed Sunday night in the desert 25 miles from Davis-Monthan AirForce Base.   Capt. Carlos Roque, a Davis-Monthan spokesman, said Tuesday thatuse of night-vision goggles, which have been implicated in numerousmilitary helicopter crashes, have been eliminated as a possiblecause.   Investigators also ruled out the main rotor shaft nut, a fastenerabout a foot in diameter that holds the main rotor head to thehelicopter frame, Maj. Fran Turnstall said.   It had been checked two days before the crash as part of aprogram to inspect more than 300 CH-3Es and similar helicoptersbelonging to the Air Force, Navy and Coast Guard for defective nuts,spokesmen said.   Turnstall said it was removed, inspected and found to beadequate. But another Pentagon spokesmen, Air Force Lt. Col. DarrelHayes, said the nut had been replaced Friday.   After the crash, the nut was found in place, ruling out thepossibility it disengaged and allowed the rotor blades to strike theaircraft, Turnstall said.   Roque said that while other maintenance issues, weather and theloading of the helicopter were studied, the five remaining CH-3Esbelonging to the 71st Special Operations Command at Davis-Monthanremained out of service Tuesday.   ``At some point, they will be permitted to fly again, aftersomething is done, probably an inspection or a changeover of somesort, or whatever the investigators recommend,'' Roque said.</TEXT></DOC>
