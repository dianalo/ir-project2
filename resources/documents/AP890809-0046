Two people were injured in related violence.   Police said more than 20 people were arrested duringdisturbances that occurred in Roman Catholic areas of west BelfastTuesday night and continued early today.   British news reports said a 15-year-old boy died after beingstruck by a plastic bullet fired by security troops trying tocontrol young IRA supporters throwing gasoline bombs and stones andburning British flags.   The Royal Ulster Constabulary, Northern Ireland's police force,would not comment on the incident.   ``The death is being investigated,'' said a police spokesman,speaking anonymously in keeping with British custom.   Crowds threw stones and gasoline bombs at police, and lightedbonfires and burned British flags, police said. A number ofvehicles, including buses and cars, were hijacked and set on fire.   On the northern outskirts of Belfast, gunmen burst into a homeand injured a man and woman who had spotted them coming andbarricaded themselves in a room, police said.   The gunmen tried to batter down the barricade but failed andthen fired a number of shots through it, hitting both people. Theywere hospitalized and reported in ``ill but stable'' condition. Nogroup claimed responsibility.   Rioting on the anniversary is an annual event although Britainabandoned the policy of detaining people without trial in 1975. Theviolence also occurred amid heightened tension over the 20thanniversary next week of the deployment of British troops in theprovince.   On Aug. 9, 1971, the British government introduced the policyfor terrorist suspects in Northern Ireland. In predawn raids thatday, 342 people were arrested.   Britain abandoned the policy in December 1975 followingworldwide condemnation. But Irish Republican Army supporters, whowere the main targets, continue to mark the anniversary withviolent anti-British rallies.   The mainly Catholic IRA is fighting British rule in NorthernIreland. It wants to unite the predominantly Protestant provincewith the Republic of Ireland, whose population is 95 percentCatholic.   Catholic civil rights demonstrations in 1968 created a violentProtestant reaction, leading to the arrival of British troops whosoon found themselves fighting the IRA. In 1972, the government inLondon closed the local parliament and took over direct rule of theprovince.</TEXT></DOC>
