(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Roads leading to the launch pad wherethe shuttle Atlantis waited for its second attempt at liftoff wererelatively empty of spectators today, and officials called it thelowest turnout of recent years.   ``There's nobody here,'' said Jerry Eads, assistant chief ofpolice in Titusville, which is just across the Indian River fromthe space center. He estimated 1,000 people were in place fivehours before the scheduled launch of 1:48 p.m. Some of them hadbeen waiting since Wednesday night.   Eads said he expected no more than 20,000 or 30,000 in his cityby launch time today, which would be the smallest crowd in recentyears.   At the Kennedy Space Center itself, 8,000 to 10,000 people wereexpected, according to Mitch Varnes, a spokesman for the NationalAeronautics Space Administration.   Last Friday, when NASA stopped the countdown 31 seconds beforelaunch, the center was filled to capacity with 15,000 people.   ``Each day we have a scrub we usually lose 50 percent of ourattendance,'' Varnes said.   An estimated 250,000 well-wishers turned out for the launch ofDiscovery in September, the first shuttle mission since theChallenger explosion in January 1986.</TEXT></DOC>
