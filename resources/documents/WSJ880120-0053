Stratus makes fault-tolerant computers for the on-line transaction processing market. Such computers are used by companies at which many people have to use computerized information at the same time. Stratus customers include banks with networks of teller machines, brokerage firms handling buy and sell orders and retailers tracking business through electronic cash registers.    Stratus said its XA 2000 Model 50, with a base price of $79,000, can handle as many as 10 transactions a second. The XA 2000 Model 70, with a base price of $110,000, can handle as many as 12 transactions a second. Stratus said its computers are compatible with older, more powerful models that handle 65 transactions a second.    The on-line transaction processing market was about $17 billion last year and will grow to $34 billion in 1991, estimates Yankee Group, a Boston market research firm. Stratus has grown rapidly since it introduced its first product six years ago, but it remains a tiny factor in the market dominated by International Business Machines Corp. Under an agreeement, IBM resells Stratus computers in certain cases where customers demand fault-tolerant computers that keep running even if parts fail.    William Foster, president and chief executive officer of Stratus, said that he expects the company to grow more than 35% annually, reaching sales of $1 billion in five years. Stratus recently said it expects to report record results for 1987, surpassing 1986 net income of $13.5 million, or 19 cents a share, on sales of $124.6 million.    John Logan, an analyst with Yankee Group, said the new computers &quot;are priced so low that (Stratus) seems to be getting more aggressive&quot; in expanding its market share. He noted that the prices are about comparable to the price of small transaction-processing systems from Digital Equipment Corp. that aren't fault tolerant, and he said they are much cheaper than IBM's systems.    The new models will be available in the second quarter and will be shipped in volume in the third quarter, Stratus said. </TEXT></DOC>
