MultiFinder-friendly.andM;Application Size: 2.3 megabytesandM;Copy Protection: NoneandM;IntelligentandM;DeveloperandM;When most software-engineering professionals think of expert systems, visionsof $60,000 list-processing (LISP) machines and $10,000 programs dance intheir heads.andP;  Products for the Macintosh are approaching the functionality ofLISP-based tools, although the best products can still cost about $5,000.andO;Intelligent Developer -- at $395 -- provides much of that power at abreakthrough price.andP;  HyperCard guru Dan Shafer and Hyperpress Publishing haveteamed up to create a program that is a good midlevel expert-system tool andan excellent lowend delivery tool.andM;Intelligent Developer is a flexible set of expert-system development anddelivery programs.andP;  Intelligent Developer Designer, the engineering segmentof the suite, is a solid expert building tool that includes a forward andbackward inference engine; rule, fact, and other knowledge editors; and aclean user interface.andP;  Intelligent Developer Builder creates stand-aloneprograms from your knowledge bases.andP;  IntelliCard, a HyperCard stack, placesyour knowledge base and a C-based inference engine into a HyperCard stack(see figure).andP;  Owners of Intelligent Developer can make up to ten copies oftheir knowledge bases with either IntelliCard or Intelligent DeveloperBuilder and can work out additional copies and commercial distributionagreements by contacting Hyperpress.andM;At the core of the Intelligent Developer technology is the Designer.andP;  Itallows knowledge engineers and domain experts to create, maintain, andexecute knowledge bases.andP;  A knowledge base is a series of IF/THEN statementsthat capture the essential rules of thumb and knowledge used by a humanexpert in solving a particular problem.andP;  For example, if you were writing anexpert system to help car dealers sort through inventory, you might definefacts such as the color of a car, whether a particular car was in stock, andwhether it had been washed, along with an output called Ford Taurus.andP;  A rulethat could deduce whether a clean, black Ford Taurus were available mightlook like this:andM;IF color = &quot;black&quot; AND (instock = YES) AND (washed = Yes) THEN car_available= Yes.andP;  output (Ford_Taurus).andM;Fact types in Intelligent Developer include text, dates, times, integers,decimals, currency, and Yes/No.andP;  Some facts act as goals within the expertsystem, and all can be validated by using a range or list.andP;  Facts that needuser responses require questions as a portion of their definition.andP;  All factscan have an explanation attached to them in case a user of your system wantsto ask it why a particular fact is important.andM;Development in Intelligent Developer is relatively straightforward.andP;  Rules,facts, outputs, and databases have an associated editor.andP;  The user interfacein Intelligent Developer Designer is not ideal, but it is functional.andP;  I hopefuture versions integrate the editing and creation functions while allowingfor examination of other facts or rules within the editor.andM;Intelligent Developer Designer's debugging tools make up for what the editingenvironment lacks.andP;  Extensive reports help to cross-reference and list everyitem in a knowledge base, and the execution debuggers are unmatched by othersystems in this price range.andP;  Setting the trace and debuggers steps youthrough a knowledge base one rule at a time and provides you with a completepicture of the system's reasoning.andM;The expert systems created with Intelligent Developer contain many excellentinterface features.andP;  For facts that require a list for validation, thesoftware automatically generates the necessary radio buttons.andP;  Check boxesare generated for list-validated items that can have multiple values.andO;Graphics can be called into a window to help make the environment a bit moreinviting.andP;  A well-crafted expert-system application written in IntelligentDeveloper can be a good addition to your corporate repertoire.andM;Intelligent Developer Designer by itself is a good value, but with itsdelivery companions, it becomes a real bargain.andM;Intelligent Developer Builder embeds the knowledge base you write into astand-alone application.andP;  The knowledge-engineering facilities, such astracing and reports, are stripped out of the system, but the user interfaceyou develop is delivered intact, which is important if you want to distributeknowledge bases that contain database information.andP;  If your knowledge basedoesn't take advantage of databases, you may want to employ IntelligentDeveloper's other delivery option -- IntelliCard.andM;With IntelliCard, you can inject your knowledge base into a HyperCard stack.andO;Your completed stack will have the look and feel of your originalapplication, but it will be a HyperCard document ready for any sounds,graphics, or animation you wish to add to it.andP;  The Intelligent Developerinference engine has been completely ported as a C kernel that resides inyour stack.andM;Dan Shafer and Hyperpress have put together some incredible stack programmingwith IntelliCard.andP;  To create an application, you make a copy of theIntelliCard Master stack and execute the copy.andP;  By clicking on the Build anIntelliCard Stack button and selecting your knowledge base, you can have theoriginal stack completely transform itself into an attractive image of yourIntelligent Developer application.andP;  If you turn on the Watch Cards Go Byoption, you can examine the steps taken by IntelliCard to transform yourboring expert system into a HyperCard work of art.andP;  Selecting this optionslows down the creation of your stack, but it is well worth the time just tosee what can be done in HyperCard.andM;Executing your IntelliCard stack differs little from executing an IntelligentDeveloper knowledge base.andP;  All the buttons, windows, and outputs youoriginally programmed are represented; they just look better.andP;  CertaintyFactors, an expert-system method for capturing fuzzy knowledge (such as&quot;maybe it's true,&quot; &quot;I kind of remember it being about like that,&quot; or &quot;I'monly this sure&quot;), are translated from a sliding button in the developmentversion to an even more attractive button in the HyperCard version.andP;  Nothingfrom the original program is excluded except the database links.andP;  By addingyour own whiz-bang HyperTalk programming and add-ons from third parties, youcan create some pretty impressive expert systems.andM;IntelliCard provides several tools for enhancing the interface.andP;  Clicking onthe Designer Mode button lets you reshape and rearrange fields and buttons.andO;When you have added the finishing touches to your stack, a click on &quot;PrepareStack for Distribution&quot; removes the licensed software (a few XFCNs from 101Scripts and Buttons and other goodies).andP;  With products such as IntelligentDeveloper, we have an inexpensive way to turn the data collection of the '70sand '80s into the knowledge processing of the '90s.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
