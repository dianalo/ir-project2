2 - IBM's OVERVIEWandM;NetView is IBM's flagship network and systems management product.andP;  It isdesigned to provide a platform for automating both systems and networkoperations.andP;  Together with the NetView family of products and Open NetworkManagement Architecture, NetView is the basis for IBM's comprehensiveend-to-end, management approach enabling customers to manage Systems NetworkArchitecture (SNA) and non-SNA resources and communication services andsystems.andM;BENEFITS o Extended openness for integration with other IBM and non-IBMmanagement applications through peer-to-peer communications and data sharing.andM;o Enhanced operations support by means of new graphics and automationcapabilities.andM;o Enriched LAN support through synergy with newly announced LAN managementproducts.andM;o New pricing and packaging options offering flexibility for central,distributed and standalone system configurations.andM;KEY FEATURES o Logical Unit 6.2 Transport o Implementation of LU6.2communications opens the way for customers to manage a broad range of IBM andnon-IBM software and hardware within the same network, resulting in morereliable processing and broader network management capability.andM;o LU6.2 makes it easier for customers and vendors to write network managementapplications that communicate with NetView.andM;o Customers can more easily write LU6.2 applications on non-SNA devices thatcommunicate directly to NetView without going through intermediate servicepoints.andM;AUTOMATION ENHANCEMENTS o NetView provides SystemView automation services forthe System/370 and System/390 environments.andM;o NetView makes it easier for customers and vendors to write networkmanagement applications that interface with NetView.andP;  o Automation based onalerts results in availability of more information for better diagnosis ofproblems, such as line failures or slow response, reducing time for diagnosisand recovery.andM;o NETVIEW GRAPHIC MONITOR FACILITY Provides integrated graphics and a newend-user interface that more easily enables users to access large quantitiesof information.andP;  Features include:andM;o Graphic support for monitoring SNA networks and resources from centralsystem and standalone system NetView, conforming to IBM's new SystemViewdefinition;andM;o Ability to take full advantage of OS/2 Extended Edition PresentationManager graphic interface;andM;o Compliance with Systems Application Architecture (SAA) Common User Accessgraphic model definitions;andM;o Windows, action bars, pull-down menus and mouse control;andM;o Access to OS/2 3270 emulation and windowing facilities from sameworkstation used for graphics, fostering integration of operator's access toother 3270 network and system management applications such as:andM;o NetView Performance MonitorandM;o Automated Operations Control/MVSandM;o Target System Control FacilityandM;o Distributed Console Access Facility.andM;The NETCENTER graphic option provides customers with the ability to monitorand control SNA and non-SNA resources from a DOS graphics workstation.andO;NETCENTER host code is available to customers at no additional charge whenthey order NetView Version 2 for MVS/ESA or MVS/XA.andP;  NETCENTER workstationcode has a one-time charge for each copy and feature.andM;o NETVIEW BRIDGE NetView Bridge provides an interface to allow customers towrite NetView applications for accessing and updating external databases.andO;For example, an interface to IBM's Info/Management product allows customersto more effectively automate their problem procedures.andM;o IMPROVED SYNERGY AMONG NETVIEW FAMILY OF PRODUCTS - NetView Version 2provides a new two-way interface between NetView and Information/ManagementVersion 4 Release 2.andM;o NetView Version 2 provides additional IBM LAN Network Manager commands.andM;o NetView Access Services 1.3 provides user-friendly access to multipleapplications from a single terminal concurrently.andM;o NetView File Transfer Program provides bulk file transfer between operatingsystems in an SNA network and now also is available for VM and VSEenvironments.andM;o NetView Performance Monitor is a real-time performance monitor thatdisplays traffic and utilization of data.andM;o Service Level Reporter 3.3 produces high quality reports from systemsmanagement data.andM;o IMPROVED SYNERGY WITH SYSTEMS PRODUCTS o NetView customers now will be ableto take advantage of:andM;o SAA Delivery Manager, which customizes, controls and delivers software fromSystem/370 host computers to OS/2 workstations.andM;o SAA SystemView Asset Manager/MVS, which supports the businessadministration and inventory of hardware and software.andM;o Multi-Terminal ASCII Emulator (MTAE), which permits multiple networks to beoperated from a single OS/2 workstation.andM;o The new Operations Planning and Control/ESA, which automates and controlsworkloads by scheduling the running of remote and local production jobsaccording to pre-determined company guidelines.andM;o PACKAGING/PRICING New pricing structure based on functional granularity,with choice of central, distributed or standalone system options.andM;Central system NetView provides:andM;o Base NetView functions;andM;o Operator interface;andM;o NetView to NetView communication.andM;Distributed system NetView provides:andM;o Base NetView functions;andM;o NetView to NetView communication.andM;Standalone system NetView provides:andM;o Base NetView function;andM;o Operator interface.andM;NETVIEW INSTALLATION FACILITY Simplifies installation and reducesinstallation time by means of an easy-to-use dialogue interface that helpsthe customer define parameters and execute NetView installation jobs.andP;  Theinterface complies with the SAA Common User Access entry model.andM;STATUS MONITOR The status monitor is enhanced for status collection.andP;  TheNetView Graphic Monitor Facility takes advantage of this capability.andO;Distributed system NetView can collect graphic status data and send it to acentral system NetView for display.andM;NETVIEW VERSION 2 RELEASE 1 NetView Version 2 Release 1 features include newpackaging and pricing, NetView Graphic Monitor Facility, NetView Bridge,NetView Installation Facility.andM;NetView Version 2 Release 1 for MVS and MVS/XA environments is scheduled tobe available December 31, 1990.andM;NETVIEW VERSION 2 RELEASE 2 NetView Version 2 Release 2 provides LU 6.2transport capability, enhancements to the current NetView automationcapabilities, and NetView Graphic Monitor Facility support is extended to theVM/ESA environment.andP;  NetView Version 2 Release 2 runs in MVS/ESA, MVS/XA,VM/ESA, VM and VSE environments.andM;NetView Version 2 Release 2 for MVS/ESA and MVS/XA environments is scheduledto be available September 30, 1991.andP;  NetView Version 2 Release 2 for the VSEenvironment is scheduled to be available December 31, 1991.andP;  NetView Version2 Release 2 for VM/ESA and VM environments is scheduled to be available onMarch 31, 1992.andM;PRICING Prices vary by processor and configuration.andP;
