For electric supply systems to be plannedfor these buildings, high dependability (no service interruption), highquality (few voltage fluctuation or distortion), and expansiveness arerequired. This article introduces the features of electric power supplysystems for intelligent buildings, the measures taken by Hitachi ManufacturingCo. to deal therewith and a part of its equipment. In order to realizehigh quality and high dependability of the electric power supply, itis necessary to install no service interruption CVCF (constant voltageand constant frequency) and emergency generators with their ample mutualcoordination and to suppress harmonic troubles and subsynchronous resonance(SSR) between the electric circuit of CVCF and mechanical torsional vibrationof the axial system of generator. Concerning equipment, new gas insulatedswitchgear, SF{sub 6} gas insulated transformer and 20KA wall fittingfrontally operated enclosed switchboard are introduced.
