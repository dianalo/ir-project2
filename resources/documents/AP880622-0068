But Reagan's comments Tuesday won immediate praise from SarahBrady, whose husband, White House Press Secretary James Brady, waswounded by presidential assailant John Hinckley. Reagan also wasinjured in the March 1981 attack but recovered completely.   The president, answering a question at a news conference inToronto, expressed support for the waiting period as well as forinstruction of new gun buyers.   ``In California, for a citizen to buy a gun, that citizen has tocome in, lay down the money of course, name, address, and soforth,'' Reagan said. ``And this goes to an agency in the stategovernment that looks into that person's entire background as towho and what they are.   ``And then they come back, after that investigation, and if theydon't have a record of any crimes or mental problems, or anythingof that kind, they are allowed to take their gun home,'' Reagancontinued, adding, ``Now, I would like to see that generally _ Ithink that all states ought to take a look at that system.''   Reagan did not say whether he supports federal legislationpending in Congress that would require a seven-day waiting periodfor handgun purchases.   The National Rifle Association opposes the bill, arguing thatsuch waiting periods, aside from not preventing serious criminalsfrom getting handguns, are unconstitutional and divert policeresources to looking into the private lives of law-abiding citizens.   One NRA lobbyist, James Jay Baker, told a Senate Judiciarysubcommittee earlier this month that even with the waiting period,Hinckley would have qualified for the weapons he obtained.   But Mrs. Brady, who became a strong gun control advocatefollowing the wounding of her husband, issued a statement Tuesdaynight saying that she was ``delighted that the president has givenhis vital support to a waiting period and background check forhandgun buyers.''   ``I hope the president's leadership will encourage Republicansand Democrats alike to join together and pass'' the federallegislation, she added.   Reagan also said that he thought instructions on gun use shouldbe required for gun purchasers.   ``I taught my entire family out at the ranch how to shoot a gunin case they ever had to,'' Reagan said. ``And I think maybe therecould be some restrictions that there had to be a certain amount oftraining taken.''</TEXT></DOC>
