We'll converse purely byvoicemail. And, with technology just around the cornerpermitting my machine to dial your machine and for the two togab to their aluminum hearts' content, the era of what I term&quot;programmed communications&quot; will be in full bloom.   As a talkative humanoid, I lament the trend. And as apublic relations adviser to the managements of 150 publiclyheld U.S. corporations, I'm increasingly convinced that thetrend is a serious threat to good business communications.What it saves in live reception time, it more than dissipatesin tragic communications delays, misdirected messages,garbled info, and overall ill-will.</LP><TEXT>   This last factor is my greatest concern. I earn a livingby helping companies earn good will. My company estimatesthat U.S. corporations will spend more than $8 billion thisyear merely in seeking good will from investors. Many timesthat sum is spent on PR to impress potential customers.   And yet we increasingly witness the undermining of glossyannual reports and chummy investor meetings and gloriousmedia coverage -- by the officious, automaton voice of arecorded telephone greeting that is fast replacing thecheery, helpful sound of a live switchboard receptionist.Many companies view the shift as a mark of modern management;a progressive new look; the frontier of audio efficiency andcall routing. But as with unpleasant aromas, their bestfriends seldom tell them that all this automated silliness isa turnoff.   We've seen that most people resent being treated like anumber, and that often their one form of contact with acompany -- the telephone -- only convinces them that they'redealing with a faceless, dehumanized, monolithic organizationthat couldn't care less about individual needs. While theyrarely waste their own time complaining, we've seen thatcustomers, investment analysts, shareholders, reporters andother corporate &quot;publics&quot; are increasingly seething withsilent resentment over programmed communications.   We've seen the case where a customer executive fought hisway through a half hour of call routing to reach a vendor'smarketing manager -- whose cheery voice popped up in multiplerecordings -- only to find that the man had passed away amonth earlier.   We've seen the case of the frantic investment analystseeking a company treasurer's advice on what day quarterlyearnings would be released. He spends 45 minutes having hisear shuttled to no less than 21 recorded messages -- only tofind that the news had been issued world-wide while he wasbusy hanging on the phone.   As the annual revenues of voice-mail vendors approaches $1billion and as a plethora of nifty new features are added --dangling mouth-watering, labor-saving temptations -- morecompanies are kneeling at the altar to worship the God ofEfficiency.   They equip every employee with voicemail at desk phones(permitting some folks to self-screen all their calls bykeeping the machine on permanently; and precluding thenecessity to ever provide &quot;substitute&quot; assistance to a callerwith a problem). Ultimately, they fire the switchboardoperator and let the whole world fend for itself bystruggling patiently through an interminable introductoryrecorded greeting and then listening to an appetizing menu of&quot;available options.&quot;   In this manner, we've seen years of costly image-buildingdecimated by a shift to recorded reception (reflecting niceelocution but icy intractability) and an audio maze oftedious call routings and referrals. Programmedcommunications says, in effect, to a caller: &quot;We're too busyto attend to your needs, so we've gone progressive andestablished a system that allows us to hear you not at yourconvenience, but at ours. When we feel like listening to you,we'll play you back.&quot;   ---   Mr. Pincus is chairman of The Financial Relations BoardInc., a public relations agency in New York.</TEXT></DOC>
