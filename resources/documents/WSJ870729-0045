CFM International is a 50-50 joint venture between GE and Snecma of France.    GE said in Brussels that the total includes some previously announced engine orders placed by individual airlines that have chosen Airbus planes. It also covers future demand by airlines for GE and CFM engines on as-yet-unordered Airbuses, GE said.    GE said in Fairfield that the orders for the 158 GE CF6-80C2 engines and the 218 CFM56-5 engines have a value of $1.2 billion and $800 million, respectively. GE expects to get 50% of the $800 million proceeds.    Airbus usually places large orders with engine manufacturers, based on the European consortium's projections for sales of its planes. Airbus, in effect, ensures places for its orders on GE and CFM production lines, then keeps the inventory itself if aircraft orders don't keep up.    GE said Airbus ordered 58 of its CF6-80C2 engines to power A300 and A310 wide body twinjets to be delivered in 1989. Airbus also ordered 100 more of the same engine to power its new A330 wide body twinjet, with deliveries to start in December 1991.    GE said that CFM International received orders for 218 of its CFM56-5 engines for installation on the new, four-engine Airbus A340. The order calls for delivery beginning in August 1990.    When Airbus's new A330 and A340 program was launched last month, it said it had commitments for 41 A330s and 89 A340s from a total of 10 customers. Some of those orders, options and other expressions of interest are believed to be included in this $2 billion order. Similarly, recent orders of the older A300 and A310 models are believed to be included.    Airbus is a Toulouse, France-based grouping of Aerospatiale of France, Messerschmitt-Boeklow-Blohm G.m.b.)H of West Germany, British Aerospace PLC and Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A. of Spain. Snecma, or Societe Nationale d'Etudes et de Constrution de Moteurs d'Aviation, is based in Paris.    Analysts say the new orders signify GE's growing strength in the market for commercial engines. &quot;They have been consistently taking market share away from companies like Pratt andamp; Whitney and Rolls Royce,&quot; said analyst Martin Sankey, who follows GE for First Boston Corp.    Five years ago, United Technologies Corp.'s Pratt andamp; Whitney unit and its affiliates won almost 75% of all orders for commercial aircraft engines, Mr. Sankey asserted. This year, he said, GE and CFM could win about 75% of the market, valued at as much as $6 billion, by his estimate.    GE closed at $57.875, up 62.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. </TEXT></DOC>
