Says LossIn the Fourth QuarterNarrowed From 1985</HL><DD> 01/30/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> BIRD </IN><DATELINE> EAST WALPOLE, Mass.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Bird Inc. said it expects to report a loss for its fourth quarter narrower than the $1.6 million loss in the year-earlier period. It declined to be specific.    George J. Haufler, chairman and chief executive officer of the maker of roofing and industrial products, said the results show a &quot;significant overall improvement&quot; because for the full year all operations were profitable for the first time since 1979. Bird usually posts losses in the fourth quarter because of the slowdown in residential home building in the Northeast, where it sells 80% of its roofing and vinyl siding.    Bird said net income for the year was about equal to the $749,000 it earned in 1985. Those earnings were less than the preferred dividend requirements, so per-share figures were negative.    The 1985 results were bolstered by a $5.1 million gain from the sale of real estate and a $287,000 tax-loss carry-forward.    Mr. Haufler added that &quot;1987 is unfolding favorably in all our businesses,&quot; citing the declining dollar, which helps sales of industrial products for the pulp and paper industry, and the strength of the home building business in the Northeast. </TEXT></DOC>
