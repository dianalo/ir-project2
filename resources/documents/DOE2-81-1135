A typical experiment afforded this new fluorine-18 transferreagent with up to 46% radiochemical yield. The specific activity of/sup 18/F-labelled N-fluoropyridinium triflate was determined by iodometrictitration to be in the range of 4.10/sup -8/ mg/Bq (1.5 mg/mCi; 1.67.10/sup-4/ Ci/{mu}M).</TEXT></DOC>
