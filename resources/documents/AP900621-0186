The quake hit at 12:30 a.m. in Iran, when most of the peoplewere in their homes, Needham said Thursday in a telephone interviewfrom Golden, Colo.   At least 25,000 people died and thousands were injured in thequake, which demolished scores of villages and buried thousands ofpeople in the rubble of their homes, Iranian officials said.   Needham said most structures in that area are built of aceramic-type brick or adobe that collapses easily.   ``It's very similar to what we had in Armenia,'' he said of theDec. 7, 1988, earthquake that killed about 25,000 people.   A Soviet parliamentary report later blamed the high number offatalities on shoddily built buildings.   The Armenian quake was measured at 6.9 on the Richter scale, butThursday's earthquake shook the earth with a magnitude of 7.7.   The shock wave traveled through the mountainous section ofcoastal Iran where most of the buildings are built on a flood plainof loosely deposited soil that shifts in an earthquake and allowsstructures to collapse, he said.   The 7.7-magnitude quake was the largest ever recorded in thatarea, where two major plates of the earth's crust meet, Needhamssaid.   ``Iran is in a very active seismic region,'' he said, and thatthere have been many smaller quakes.   Twelve earthquakes greater than magnitude 7 have occurred inIran during the last 30 years, Needhams said.   A quake of magnitude 7 is considered a major earthquake, capableof widespread, heavy damage in populated areas.</TEXT></DOC>
