The defendant, William Bronec Jr., profited by nearly $10,000 under the scheme, according to his plea agreement. He could receive a jail sentence of as long as five years and a fine of as much as $250,000.    Mr. Bronec agreed to testify against another former bank employee, Danny Omar Cherif. Prosecutors allege that Mr. Cherif illegally entered the bank, using a key card he kept after being fired by the bank in 1987, and stole information on stock-related deals that he and Mr. Bronec used to make trades.    Mr. Cherif's attorney couldn't be reached to comment. </TEXT></DOC>
