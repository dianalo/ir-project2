At least 13 people were reported killed and scores injured.   A doctor at a small hospital near where the clashes occurredsaid about 100 people were treated for injuries and that 12 haddied. A soldier was killed in another part of the city when he wasrun over by a tank racing to the square.   Thousands of troops armed with rifles marched up the east sideof the vast square, which has been occupied by pro-democracyprotesters for three weeks. Until Saturday, the tense standoff hadbeen generally peaceful, even though the students were repeatedlyordered to leave the square and end the protest.   Students threw bottles and other objects at soldiers whoadvanced Saturday night, while troops beat those who obstructedtheir path with sticks.   Another group of more than 1,000 troops gained a foothold on thesouthwest corner of the vast square, while throngs of students andsupporters tried to block their movement.   A tank pulled up next to the Great Hall of the People, on thewestern side of the square, but it was besieged by crowds peltingit with rocks.   Another tank roared down Changan Avenue, the main street, fromthe east, followed by thousands of shouting people on bicycles.Other tanks crashed through barricades in the west.   The street where the gunfire took place was speckled with blood.Crowds broke up the pavement to throw stones at the troops and setone military bus on fire.   Late Saturday, a convoy of at least 40 trucks with severalthousand troops broke through the barricades set up by people andbegan moving slowly down Changan Avenue toward the square.   Shortly after 1 a.m. Sunday (noon EDT Saturday) troops brokethrough a flaming barricade at the Xidan intersection, about onemile west of the square.   A man at the intersection about a mile west of the squarereceived a gunshot wound in the chest as truckloads of troopsrammed through barricades set up by citizens. A medical student onthe scene said the man's heart had stopped beating and there waslittle hope for his survival.   About 6,000 people trying to block the path of the troops werebeaten by riot police and troops and attacked with tear gas.Citizens had set fire to public buses parked across the road, butthe army trucks slammed through.   At least five people were taken away after being hit by the firein the initial incident. More than a dozen others were bleedingfrom wounds suffered when troops beat people in the crowd.   One 28-year-old worker hit by a bullet in the leg said, ``thegovernment is fascist. How can they do this to me? How can they dothis to the people?''   The attack on protesters first began about 8 p.m. Saturday whenthousands of Beijing citizens trying to push the troops back beganhurling stones. Police retaliated by attacking people withtruncheons and electric cattle prods, firing tear gas and finallyopening fire.   About 5,000 troops made a dash for the square from the eastearlier in the evening, but they were turned back and headed up aside street.   One student speaking in a cracked voice over a loudspeaker onthe square urged students not to leave and said, ``We Chinese willpersist to the end. If we die at Tiananmen Square, then so be it.''   About 200,000 people were gathered on the square to protect thethousands of students who have staged a pro-democracy sit-in theresince May 13.   The pro-democracy protests began on April 15 with a simple callby students for talks on increasing social freedoms and endingofficial corruption. They peaked during the week of May 15, whenSoviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev visited the country and up to1 million poured into the streets.   The government declared martial law on May 20 and troopsattempted to advance on the square, but they were driven back bymasses of average citizens sympathetic to the protesters.   The protest led to a power struggle in the government, withhardliners such as senior leader Deng Xiaoping and Premier Li Pengapparently winning control.   The shooting Saturday night came after an earlier attempt toquell the protests failed earlier in the day. Hundreds of policehad fired tear gas on crowds for the first time in seven weeks ofpro-democracy protests.   Witnesses said riot troops beat at least 30 people east ofTiananmen Square. But hundreds of thousands of people took to thestreets to protect the students.   A detachment of 5,000 troops, surrounded by taunting crowds oneblock off the square, began hitting people with belts. During theshort fracas, people burst into tears and the crowd shouted ``Youcan't hit the people!''   Security forces made pre-dawn and afternoon advances on thesquare but failed to dislodge the students, who have occupied the100-acre plaza since May 13.   Riot police also beat students and others with nightsticks inafternoon attacks both to the east and west of the square, thesymbolic center of power in China. Some protesters tossed rocks atthe police.   At least 13 people were seen with bloodied heads and bodies.Witnesses said two truckloads of riot police with shields andsticks began beating people outside the Beijing Hotel east of thesquare, injuring 30 people.   Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang, a reformer who advocatedconcessions to the students, has reportedly lost his post and isunder house arrest. But Chinese and diplomatic sources said it wasunclear whether hard-liners had enough support among the rest ofthe party leadership to purge Zhao from the government.</TEXT></DOC>
