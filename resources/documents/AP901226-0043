Detectives said Clifton Williams, 30, linked several extensioncords together and savagely attacked his 50-year-old mother, DessieWilliams, in her bed leaving her in a pool of blood in asecond-floor hallway of their home.   The suspect, who relatives said has a history of mentalproblems, was arrested at his home this morning after being atlarge since Monday.   An arrest warrant charges him with first-degree murder andpossession of a deadly weapon.   The body of Mrs. Williams, a hospital housekeeper, wasdiscovered Monday by her daughter, Sheila Mayor, 33.   ``I didn't have to get up the stairs all the way to see mymother. I screamed and ran out of the house,'' she said.   Mayor and her other brother, Norman Williams, said CliftonWilliams had been diagnosed as a paranoid-schizophrenic.   Medication kept his condition under control, they said, but hewas prone to irrational behavior when he would refuse to take hispills. He had gone a long time without his medication, they said.   ``He was different from all of us,'' Mayor said. ``You dosomething one way and he'd do the opposite.''   ``But we always felt he didn't have the capability of hurtinganybody,'' Norman Williams said.   Clifton Williams kept the electric saw in his bedroom, using itat times to cut wood into pieces, said Mayor.</TEXT></DOC>
