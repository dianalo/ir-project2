(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>From Aachen to Zyrien, with everything in between, three new CD-ROM-basedencyclopedias offer a bookshelf's worth of information for students,educators, researchers, and the merely curious.andP;  Grolier's ElectronicEncyclopedia, World Book's Information Finder, and Compton's MultiMediaEncyclopedia are electronic versions of traditional multivolume referencesets.andP;  Not one article has been abbreviated or changed in the CD-ROMversions; only the method of delivery has been modernized to exploitstate-of-the-art information-retrieval technology.andM;Grolier's pioneered the CD-ROM encyclopedia with the first edition of theElectronic Encyclopedia in 1986.andP;  The current version has been improved,updated, and expanded to include more than 1,500 stunning color photographsdisplayable on computers with VGA monitors.andM;The EE relies on familiar pull-down menus (activated by Alt-key combinations)to set search parameters or call up help screens, file menus, and tool oredit windows.andP;  Text can be sent to a printer or disk file, and a notepad letsyou jot down comments and notes.andM;From the tools menu, you can place &quot;bookmarks&quot; in text for fast retrieval,and cross-reference items within an article.andP;  In an article on the AmericanRevolution, for example, the names Washington, Adams, and Jefferson aredisplayed in capitals to indicate a cross reference.andP;  Putting the cursor onone of these brings up a list of related articles.andP;  Unfortunately, thecross-linking system indexes only the last name, so linking to ThomasJefferson in the text brings up a menu that includes references to JeffersonAirplane and Joseph Jefferson as well as to the president.andM;Many features and options may be accessed directly by using Alt-keycombinations.andP;  Alt-I, for example, brings up an index of photographs so theymay be selected and viewed individually as well as within a related article.andM;One of EE's most powerful features is the Options menu  Alt-O, which setssearch parameters (by article text, titles, picture captions, bibliographies,or fact boxes) and relationships of the search words (same article, sameparagraph, words apart, or exact order).andP;  You might use these parameters tosearch for everyone born on the same birth date--a feat the other twoproducts reviewed here can't duplicate.andM;World Book's Information Finder makes searching as simple as typing a topic.andO;Typing &quot;American Revolution,&quot; for instance, brings up 24 screens under theheading &quot;Revolutionary War in America.&quot;andM;One outstanding feature of Information Finder is its split-screen interface.andO;On the left, a window displays a topic outline; on the right, a larger windowcontains the article.andP;  Moving the cursor through the outline causes the otherwindow to page through the text.andP;  It's an intuitive, elegant, and easy way toview and organize a lot of information.andM;Additional information can be summoned by tapping function keys.andP;  F6 fetchesa list of related articles, and F2 pops up a list of Quick Fact Tables.andP;  TheF7 key gives you access to the 139,000-word World Book Dictionary, which isitself a handy reference.andM;Unlike the other two CD-ROM-based encyclopedias we evaluated, InformationFinder lacks pictures and graphics.andP;  On the positive side, that means it willrun with virtually any type of computer display.andP;  More distressing than thelack of visuals is Information Finder's limited print capabilities, which areno better than the print-screen function built into DOS.andP;  The program letsyou print only one screenful of data at a time.andM;The publisher says printing was intentionally crippled because the product isaimed at schools; teachers want to discourage plagiarism.andP;  Perhaps thehollowness of that reasoning has become apparent--World Book says the nextversion will allow entire articles to be printed or saved to a disk file.andM;Compton's has gone all-out with its MultiMedia Encyclopedia.andP;  Thiscutting-edge product demonstrates what a CD-ROM can truly be.andP;  MultiMediarequires a mouse and a VGA display.andP;  A CD-ROM player with audio output jacksor a computer with IBM's speech adapter card is necessary for voice andmusic.andM;MultiMedia uses a point-and-click interface, and although everything can bereached by clicking,&quot; most users will probably prefer to type out the name oftheir research topic.andP;  Once selected, the text appears in a scrolling window;icons along the left margin indicate the availability of additional material.andM;A camera icon means a photograph is available.andP;  Click on it and the screenfills with a high-resolution image.andP;  Other icons include an open book, whichdenotes a cross reference, and a pair of eyes, which symbolizes a summary.andP;  Aset of headphones alerts you that speech or music is available, and a motionpicture camera represents animation.andM;In an article on human anatomy, for example, clicking on the headphone iconnext to text about the heart muscle triggers a recording of a heartbeat.andO;Click on the camera icon beside the paragraph on joint movement and you'llsee an animated sequence showing an elbow bending.andP;  Click on any word in thetext, and MultiMedia will look up that word in its dictionary.andP;  If the wordis underlined (as about 1,500 are), MultiMedia will pronounce it for you.andM;The main menu offers ways to access data other than through a topic search.andO;There's an American history time line, a collection of articles on science, apicture explorer, an &quot;idea search, &quot; and a topic tree, but my favorite is theworld atlas.andP;  By clicking on a globe, you can zoom in on a specificcountly--or even a state and city--and then &quot;click up&quot; relevant articles.andM;The icon-based interface with the pictures, sound, and animation is sure toappeal to elementary, junior, and senior high school students; it couldencourage them to explore topics more thoroughly than they might withtraditional research materials.andP;  The high-tech interface is just theincentive that a slow learner or poorly motivated student needs.andM;MultiMedia is one very slick software package, and you'll want a fastcomputer (I recommend an 80386-based machine) to fully exploit all itsfeatures.andM;CD-ROM encyclopedias could be the first software products to stimulate broadconsumer interest in CD-ROM drives.andP;  The encyclopedias not only exploit theCD's massive storage capacity, but also can tap its high-quality audiocapabilities.andP;  Given the sizable cost of most bookform encyclopedias, manyhome users may find the high-tech electronic versions to be surprisingly goodvalues.andM;Each of these three CD-ROM reference works has its strengths; each has aplace in the encyclopedia market.andP;  If I were picking a product for a schoolsystem, I would select Compton's MultiMedia Encyclopedia, simply because itshigh-tech interface would assure constant use by the video-game generation.andO;For my own use as a research tool, I love the split-screen format ofInformation Finder.andP;  I'm not troubled by its lack of graphics, but I cannottolerate its crippled print feature.andM;Until the next version of Information Finder comes out, I'd pick Grolier'sElectronic Encyclopedia.andP;  Grolier's is not only $150 less expensive thanInformation Finder, but also has more bibliographic references than either ofthe other two encyclopedias.andP;  That's an important consideration for seriousresearchers.andM;List Price: Grolier's Electronic Encyclopedia, Version 2.0, $395.andP;
