Three weeks of debate on the bill dealt only fleetingly with defense programs themselves, instead focusing mostly on the extent to which Congress should direct foreign policy -- in particular treaty-making with the Soviet Union. The deliberations ended in a bitter and heavily partisan exchange, with Republicans lashing out at Democratic-sponsored provisions they said would tie the president's hand in conducting superpower relations.    At the center of the controversy was an amendment backed by Sen. Sam Nunn (D., Ga.), the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. It would prohibit the Pentagon from conducting any strategic defense -- that is, anti-missile-tests that would violate the traditional interpretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. The Reagan administration favors a more liberal interpretation of the accord, which it says would allow quicker development of anti-missile technologies.    The Senate also adopted an amendment that would require the Defense Department to adhere to the 1979 SALT II treaty's numerical limits on intercontinental missiles as long as the Soviets continue to abide by the same restrictions.    Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.) called the amendments &quot;disgraceful.&quot; Sen. Dan Quayle (R., Ind.) said the bill &quot;is taking the bipartisanship that Congress has sought in foreign policy and shredding it.&quot;    Democrats defended the measure. Sen. Nunn said the SALT amendment will give the Soviets an incentive to keep their missile forces within the treaty's limits. Under the amendment, if the Soviets exceed those levels, the U.S. no longer would be bound by the restrictions.    Noting that the two superpowers soon will try to negotiate new limits on intercontinental missiles, Sen. Nunn described the provision as an &quot;interim restraint.&quot; Defending the curbs on anti-missile tests, he emphasized that the provision merely would hold the White House to the interpretation that the Nixon administration gave the Senate in 1972, when lawmakers ratified the ABM treaty.    During its consideration of the bill, the Senate also debated proposals to curb the Reagan administration's policy of protecting Kuwaiti tankers in the Persian Gulf. But it shied away from taking any action on that issue.    Had Congress decided to invoke the War Powers Act, as some lawmakers proposed, President Reagan would have had to obtain congressional approval within 90 days to continue the Persian Gulf operations. But the lawmakers' indecision left smoldering the debate over whether the law is workable or even constitutional.    The defense budget still faces a tortuous course. In a letter to Sen. John Warner (R., Va.), ranking Republican on the arms panel, President Reagan warned he would veto any measure that contains &quot;unilateral restrictions on the U.S. that are not enforceable in the Soviet Union.&quot; That clearly would appear to include the Senate-approved bill with its arms-control language.    But Sen. Nunn has said that in the event of a veto he would seek to cut the president's anti-missile defense program, called the Strategic Defense Initiative. He also has said he would try to attach the bill's arms-control provisions to any defense spending legislation that the Defense Department would require to continue operating. Such a bill would be much more difficult to veto than the just-approved measure.    &quot;The president can veto, but he can't fund the Army, the Navy, the Air Force and the Marine Corps,&quot; Sen. Nunn said.    Beyond the controversy over arms-control matters, there is still much to thrash out in the military budget itself. The Senate measure is $14 billion higher than the $289 billion defense budget passed by the House. Both fall short of the $312 billion sought by the Reagan administration.    The House and Senate versions are far apart in their approaches to individual weapons programs. The House would provide $2.1 billion for single-warhead Midgetman missiles, while the Senate would provide $1.4 billion. The Senate bill, but not the House version, would cut off funds for continued purchases of Grumman Corp.'s A-6 attack aircraft. And the Senate bill would delay the Army's development of the advanced LHX helicopter, while the House voted to move ahead with this program.    The two chambers are also far apart on Strategic Defense Initiative spending. The Senate bill would provide $4.6 billion for the program, while the House would provide only $3.1 billion. Actual spending for fiscal 1987, which ended Wednesday, was $3.6 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
