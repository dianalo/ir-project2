He said he left home after being arrested andbeaten for marching against Nicaragua's Sandinista government.   ``They will be coming not only for economic reasons, but forpolitical reasons and I think they will come if I tell them thateven if they get put in jail here, they will not get beaten up,'' hesaid.   But for now, the Immigration and Naturalization Service's toughnew asylum policy has achieved its goal: a sharply reduced flow ofCentral Americans across the Texas border. Patrol officers all alongthe border said the policy has not yet resulted in an increase inillegal immigration, despite rumors that immigrants were shiftingtheir point of entry westward to Laredo and El Paso.</TEXT><DATELINE>LIVINGSTON, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hunters call it the experience of alifetime, a trophy retrieved from the long-ago days of the Americanfrontier; critics call the century's first large-scale buffalo hunta slaughter and a disgrace.   More than 15 percent of the Yellowstone National Park buffaloherds have already been killed this winter as they wandered beyondthe park's boundaries to forage, victims of a state law that permitsthe shootings to avert the spread of disease to cattle.   A total of 500 likely will be killed by Monday. And the state wasmailing letters today to 250 hunters, notifying them that they cancome to Paradise Valley to shoot their buffalo if the beasts crossinto Montana.   ``If any animal, even a bloodthirsty Montana hunter, could be apart of this and say it's exciting, it's such stupidity that I can'tbelieve it,'' said Cleveland Amory, president of the Fund forAnimals in New York. ``This is no longer a hunt, it's a massacre.''</TEXT><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   People who smoke to control their weight aresimply redistributing their fat and putting themselves at risk forpotentially deadly illnesses, according to a study published today.

In the House,the Democrats have widened the lead they held previously.   One result is that Republicans suddenly are sounding likethreadbare populists, while Democrats say they have made peace withthe captains of industry who once regarded them with suspicion.</TEXT><DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Housing Secretary Jack Kemp, once a championof ``trickle-down'' economics, spent the night in a housing projectas part of President Bush's mission to take ``inventory'' of thenation's homeless and impoverished.
