<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-23-1270 </DOCNO><TEXT>Presented are the results from a laboratory test program conducted toidentify and evaluate materials for converting hazardous geothermal residuesto a non-hazardous and potentially usable form. Results indicate thatthe residues can be effectively incorporated, as a fine aggregate, intoportland cement-based composites. Five geothermal residues obtained fromsites in the Salton Sea area of California were evaluated. Three of thesewere classified as hazardous. After mixing with cement, the leach rateswere all well below specified levels. Although structural-grade compositeswere produced, gradual reductions in properties with time up to 1 yrwere noted. This indicates ongoing chemical reactions between the cementpaste and the constituents of the residues. Further research is necessarybefore the composites could be considered for use in structural applications.3 refs., 8 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
