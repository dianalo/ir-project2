The latest refugees joined 109 Vietnamese who on Tuesday weretaken to Tai A Chau, an island 20 miles southwest of Hong Kong. Thegovernment said all usual refugee facilities were filled by the2,300 boat people who flooded Hong Kong in the last three days.   The refugees were told not to leave their boats, according to apolice spokesman.   Marine police were to provide the Vietnamese with food, waterand security until the government can find a place for them, thespokesman said. He said he did not know how long that might take.   Malaysia, the Philippines and Hong Kong received hundreds ofthousands of Indochinese boat people after communist forcesdefeated the U.S.-backed governments in South Vietnam and Cambodiain April 1975. Thousands of Vietnamese still flee their homeland.   A year ago, Hong Kong adopted a screening policy that treats allIndochinese refugees as illegal immigrants subject to repatriationunless they can prove they fled political persecution.   Despite the policy, however, the influx continues. Since June1988, more than 20,000 boat people arrived in Hong Kong and only1,600 have been screened, according to a government statement. Thenumber of boat people in the British colony is 23,593, thestatement said.   Vietnam has agreed to attend an international conference onIndochinese refugees that is to be held in Geneva June 13-14.</TEXT></DOC>
