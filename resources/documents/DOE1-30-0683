The methods are discussedof instrumentation diagnostics, of testing the likelihood of measuredvalues of signals from sensors, and of physical testing of measured quantities.Basic methods are presented for determining the coolant output temperaturefor fuel assemblies without thermoelectric transducers, for updatingthe coefficients for interpretation of the measured self-powered detectorsignals, and for calculating the basic parameters of the reactor core.(author). 2 figs., 1 tab., 7 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
