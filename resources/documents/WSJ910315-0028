In the past six months, computer hackers in the U.S. andCanada have been systematically stealing phone records andusing local and toll-free 800 phone numbers to gain access tooffice voice-mail systems around the country, allowing themto use the office phones for their own purposes.</LP><TEXT>   The size of the intrusion is still being gauged by theSecret Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, butit certainly involves &quot;hundreds of companies and governmentoffices,&quot; says Earl Devaney, special agent in charge of theSecret Service's Fraud Division. &quot;If it continues increasingat the rate we're seeing,&quot; Mr. Devaney adds, &quot;it could runinto the tens of millions of dollars in losses&quot; in fraudulentphone bills for business and agencies.   Current voice-mail systems are vulnerable because theiraccess codes are relatively easy to crack. Once hackerscalling from outside an office break a code and take controlof an extension, they have several options. They can use theline to make long-distance calls, at the company's expense.They can leave and receive messages.   &quot;The hacker calls on our 800 line for free,&quot; says WesWinchester, a data-processing systems coordinator at the U.S.Postal Service Center in New Brunswick, N.J. &quot;He creates amailbox for himself, say on extension 5001, and then tellsthe system to forward the messages {for him} by calling hishouse. Our system gets charged for those calls.&quot;   Some hackers even change the company password, renderingthe voice system inaccessible to employees trying to retrievetheir messages. &quot;I pushed my access code in, and the systemwouldn't accept it,&quot; says Phillip Cassidy, finance andleasing manager for U-Save Auto Rental of America Inc.,Hanover, Md. &quot;The hacker had locked it up.&quot;   Vincent Howley, U-Save's executive vice president adds:&quot;They're giving out company phone numbers across the country,in Jersey, California. They have the capacity to cause majorproblems.&quot;   This isn't the first time that hackers have penetrated thenation's phone system. Last November, two teen-agers fromStaten Island, N.Y., allegedly gained unauthorized entry to acomputerized voice-mail system owned by International DataGroup, Framingham, Mass., then changed recorded greetings tolewd messages, made bomb threats and erased customers'messages. Earlier last year, a group of California hackersallegedly breached computer systems at Pacific Bell and asecure computer system used by the U.S. Army to interceptphone information.   Long-distance phone companies, long victimized by phonefraud, began moving aggressively against crooks a few yearsago. The phone companies lengthened the authorization accesscodes used to charge calls to more than 10 digits, makingthem harder to crack. They also worked with law enforcementauthorities to raid offenders' homes and businesses. Now aproblem that cost the industry tens of millions of dollars inrevenues seems to be subsiding, according to Robert Fox,assistant vice president of security at U S SprintCommunications Co., a unit of United Telecommunications Inc.   Computer hackers, however, are finding new victims. &quot;Theyhave migrated away from the long-distance carriers and findit safer to attack a company's phone system, which usuallyuses four- to seven-digit access codes,&quot; Mr. Fox says. &quot;It'sa lot easier to get a dial tone through that kind of phonesystem.&quot;   Hackers gain access to corporate voice-mail systems in avariety of ways. The toll-free 800 numbers supplied tocorporate and government phone customers by long-distancecarriers, plus other sensitive phone records, are stored indata banks owned by local phone companies. A hacker using apersonal computer and modem can break into these data banksthrough phone lines and steal customer records showing phonenumbers and voice-mail access codes. The hacker can then usethis information to manipulate voice-mail systems.   Once inside a system, hackers may use a stolen password toget a dial tone from the company's phone line, and then &quot;thereal trouble begins,&quot; says the Secret Service's Mr. Devaney.&quot;They make long-distance calls around the world, and thecompany doesn't find out it has a problem until 30 to 60 daysafter the intrusion, when it gets its phone bill.&quot;   Hackers can also change passwords or create mailboxes inphantom phone extensions. Mr. Winchester noticed the problemat the Postal Service office when its phone system'sdata-storage unit became overloaded. &quot;We also saw phony boxesfor extensions that didn't exist,&quot; he says.   Some of the messages left by hackers are downright nasty.At Health Management Strategies International Inc.,Alexandria, Va., a hacker took over a mailbox and left amessage that identified a Las Vegas, Nev., man by his name,age and Social Security number and told fellow hackers toinflict punishment on the man and his son. &quot;I really want hiskid nailed,&quot; said the hacker. &quot;Call up the utilities, givehis name, age and Social Security number and tell 'em youwant your electricity shut off. Then call the phone companyand do the same thing. Toast the dude.&quot;   Another hacker left Visa credit card information for awoman in Huntington Beach, Calif.   Mr. Devaney recalls one hacker who &quot;called a company andsaid, `I am in control of your phone system. If you don't payme, I'll bring it crashing down.'&quot; The hacker didn't makegood on his threat but wasn't caught.   &quot;Their boldness is fostered by their anonymity,&quot; Mr.Devaney says. &quot;They're sitting in a bedroom somewhere, notrobbing a bank where everyone can see them.&quot;   The hackers themselves have taken names such as Ice Cube,Tall Man from the Ministry of Fear and Uppercut. There's evena guy named Techno, from Ultralogic, a group of Canadianhackers who use Hewlett-Packard computers. &quot;If you'reCanadian and know hacking, leave a message or call GlobalGenocide,&quot; says Techno, leaving a number in Ontario.   U-Save's Mr. Howley and others are having a hard timefiguring where to turn for help against phone fraud. TheSecret Service targets high-dollar, high-volume fraud, Mr.Devaney says. The FBI usually doesn't investigate until thelocal phone company asks it to. And long-distance companiescan't do much about people who dial phone numbers and reachprivate phone systems that long-distance carriers don'tcontrol.   The real solution, says Richard Petillo, manager ofcorporate security for American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., isfor a company to beef up its own security. Hackers, he says,&quot;look to the most available and least protected of systems.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
