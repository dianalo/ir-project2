The fighting ended a six-month lull in direct confrontations between the U.S. and Iran and may open a new, more perilous chapter for the U.S. forces assigned there, and possibly for Americans elsewhere who may be subject to terrorist attacks.    It began at about 1 a.m. EDT, when the U.S. attacked two offshore platforms in the central gulf in retaliation for damage inflicted on a U.S. frigate last week by an Iranian mine. The reprisal set off a string of Iranian attacks and U.S. counterstrikes, with Iran suffering heavy damage to two frigates, a missile-bearing gunship and three Boghammer attack boats.    There were no known U.S. casualties, but a helicopter operating off the USS Wainwright, a cruiser, was reported missing.    In a speech to a contractors group, President Reagan said: &quot;We aim to deter further Iranian aggression, not provoke it. They must know that we will protect our ships, and if they threaten us, they'll pay a price.&quot;    Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci noted yesterday that Tehran previously had avoided direct confrontations with U.S. naval forces, which have much more firepower than Iranian naval vessels in the region. &quot;It certainly didn't follow the precedent,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm not sure it's explainable in terms of Western logic.&quot;    For Iran, the escalation of hostilities -- and the heavy losses to the Iranian navy -- came as pressures were growing more intense on several fronts. Its land war with Iraq has become harsher, with increased attacks on Iranian cities and an attack with chemical weapons on an Iranian-held city in Iraq. Iran is also unnerved by an Iraqi counteroffensive mounted on the Faw peninsula in southern Iraq. Relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia have worsened as a result of the Saudis' clamping down on number of Iranians allowed on the pilgrimage to Mecca, which begins this week. Meanwhile, Tehran reportedly is worried that the U.S.-Soviet accord on Afghanistan might signal a willingness of the two superpowers to act in concert on matters in the region.    &quot;In a political sense, the cost (to Tehran) of not responding would have been enormous,&quot; said Greg Rose, an expert on Iran who is a political science professor at North Texas State University.    Whether the day of gunfire will turn into a sustained shooting war is a conundrum to U.S. strategists. Late yesterday, Secretary Carlucci said, &quot;Hostilities have ended, unless the Iranians once again demonstrate hostile intent.&quot;    Meanwhile, worries mounted in Washington that after faring badly in the naval battle, Tehran would lash out with new acts of terrorism. &quot;They've got to raise the stakes,&quot; said one State Department official. &quot;What they're after is a spectacular in the gulf. They'd love to sink a ship, but they can't do anything militarily. Terrorism is what they do best.&quot;    Iran's world-wide terrorist apparatus already has swung into action again, ending a lull that began last summer, U.S. intelligence sources said. Officials suspect the Iranians knew in advance of Shiite terrorists' plans to hijack a Kuwaiti jetliner April 5 and permitted the hijackers to reinforce themselves during a stop in the Iranian city of Mashad.    In addition, according to U.S. intelligence sources, terrorists directed by the Iranian government now have launched nine attacks against Saudi targets in, among other places, Bombay, India; Lagos, Nigeria; Karachi, Pakistan; Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; Singapore; and Tokyo. Yesterday, they bombed a Saudia airline ticket office and a Jewish community center in Frankfurt, the sources said.    &quot;After yesterday's events in the gulf, the question is whether the Iranians are going to try the same kind of thing with American targets,&quot; said an administration official.    Secretary Carlucci emphasized that after the retaliatory attacks on the offshore platforms at Sirri Island and the Sassan oil drilling area, all of the U.S. actions &quot;were taken in self-defense.&quot; Shortly after the two platforms were set ablaze, a 154-foot Iranian gunboat, the Joshan, approached the U.S. ships, the Pentagon said. After U.S. radio warnings to turn back went unheeded, the Wainwright and the frigate Simpson opened fire on the Joshan and sank the vessel, which would normally carry of crew of about 30. Around the same time, the Wainwright fired at two approaching Iranian F-4 fighter planes, which then veered away.    Later in the day, two U.S. A-6 attack planes fired on three Boghammer attack boats that were mounting strikes on platforms and commercial and military vessels in the Mubarak oil field offshore from the United Arab Emirates. Pentagon officials said that the air strikes sank one of the Iranian boats and crippled the other two.    Just north of the Strait of Hormuz, the Iranian frigate Sahand fired at two patrolling A-6 planes, which fired back with Harpoon missiles and a laser-guided bomb, disabling the ship, the Pentagon said. A U.S. frigate also fired a Harpoon at the Sahand. Further south, in the Strait of Hormuz, another Iranian frigate, the Sabalan, fired at another A-6 plane, which dropped a laser-guided bomb that crippled the vessel. The A-6 aircraft operate off the USS Enterprise, an aircraft carrier operating in the Gulf of Oman.    Thus far, Secretary Carlucci said, &quot;we've received no criticism from any countries&quot; on the attacks and counterstrikes. In Congress, lawmakers expressed support for the U.S. actions, but warned of heightened dangers for the U.S. and a new confrontation over the War Powers Act.    &quot;Now is the time to send only one message to our adversaries: that the United States -- the president, the Congress and the people -- are united and determined to meet our responsibilities and defend our interests in the gulf,&quot; said Senate Republican Leader Robert Dole of Kansas. &quot;I hope the ayatollah gets that message, so that we can all avoid further violence and bloodshed.&quot;    Amid all the expressions of support for the administration's actions, House Speaker James Wright called them &quot;measured and deliberate&quot; but pointedly stopped short of approving of them. Meanwhile a likely political battle is mounting over the War Powers Act, which gives Congress the power to invoke the law, and then decide in 60 days' time whether the military engagement should continue. Sen. Mark Hatfield (R., Ore.) urged his colleagues to vote to invoke the law, adding, &quot;My fear is that it will take dead bodies -- the dead bodies of U.S. servicemen -- to make us stand up and accept our constitutional responsibilities.&quot;    ---   John Walcott and John E.
