The hospital's staff advised Steven Smith to go to a clinicbecause his case wasn't serious enough, said Bellevue spokesmanJames Walsh.   Smith pleaded innocent Tuesday to rape, robbery and two counts ofmurder in the slaying of Dr. Kathryn Hinnant, 33, whose body wasfound in her office Sunday morning.   Smith had been secretly living in an equipment room on the 22ndfloor of the hospital since last month, police said. He hadapparently moved freely throughout the 25-story building, oftenwearing stolen hospital staff clothing, investigators said.   At Smith's arraignment, Executive Assistant District AttorneyJames Kindler said Smith told police after his arrest that he hadstrangled Hinnant while forcibly stealing her coat, jewelry andother property.   Marvyn Kornberg, Smith's lawyer, said the confession was improperbecause police failed to call Smith's lawyer first.   Kornberg said his client has a ``psychiatric background.''   Smith was admitted briefly to Bellevue Hospital in December,after he allegedly tried to commit suicide by taking rat poison,Walsh said.   ``He has a psychiatric history and a history as a felon,'' Walshsaid.   Smith's brother, who said his name was Nick, told The New YorkTimes that Smith had been hospitalized for psychiatric treatment inthe past.   ``He's abnormal,'' his brother said. ``He doesn't act ordinary.''   From April 1 to April 28, Smith was confined to a psychiatrichospital in Columbia, S.C., for a suicide attempt, police said.   Hinnant's family lives in Columbia, S.C., but Smith's presencethere appeared coincidental, police said.</TEXT></DOC>
