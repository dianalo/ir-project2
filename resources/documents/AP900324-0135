(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Lithuania's president likened hisBaltic republic to an occupied land on Saturday and said a convoyof Soviet tanks that rumbled through the capital had heightenedfears of a clash with Moscow.   Nervous Lithuanian lawmakers voted to transfer their power toforeign soil if they were assaulted or arrested, and polls openedfor multiparty elections to local governing councils.   Young Lithuanians who deserted the Soviet army when theirrepublic declared independence took refuge at a hospital Saturdaynight, hoping a pair of policemen and a few Red Cross signs wouldprotect them from arrest by Soviet authorities. Lithuanianofficials recommended they seek refuge in churches.   In Moscow, the Soviet Foreign Ministry ordered foreigndiplomats, including two Americans, out of Lithuania and saidforeign journalists would be barred from traveling to the republic.There was no mention of foreign journalists already in Lithuania,meaning no news blackout was imposed.   In Washington, President Bush's national security adviser, BrentScowcroft, warned that any Soviet use of force or intimidation inLithuania ``would be counterproductive'' to U.S.-Soviet relations.   About 100 Soviet military vehicles containing at least 1,000paratroopers armed with automatic weapons rumbled along the mainhighway through the heart of Vilnius without stopping earlySaturday, official Lithuanian sources said.   There were at least 22 tanks and armored personnel carriers anddozens of green military trucks. The parliament's informationdepartment quoted witnesses as saying there were 59 tanks and 50other vehicles. No incidents were reported.   The convoy passed within about 100 yards of Lithuania'sparliament building. Lawmakers called the maneuvers another Sovietattempt to rattle their nerves in the so-far peaceful campaign forindependence.   Since Lithuania declared independence from Moscow on March 11,Soviet leaders have repeatedly warned the republic to return to theSoviet Union. President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has called the moveillegal but said he would not use force against the republic of 3.8million people.   In referring to Saturday's maneuver, Lithuanian PresidentVytautas Landsbergis told the Supreme Council legislature: ``Wefelt we were really in an occupied country. An alien power sentforces and we don't know why.   ``Tension is rising with this demonstration of military force,with this frightening of people with Soviet soldiers.''   At a Saturday night news conference, deputy Prime MinisterKazimieras Motieka warned that political officers in the Sovietmilitary were telling soldiers they may have to act to prevent acoup d'etat. He charged they were trying to prepare troops forattacking the democratically elected government of Lithuania.   In Tokyo, Leonid Kravchenko, head of the official Soviet newsagency Tass, said a state of emergency may be declared. He did notelaborate, but such a declaration by Gorbachev would give the newlystrengthened president greater authority to reassert Soviet powerin Lithuania.   Meanwhile, lawmakers passed a resolution that would transferpower to the senior diplomat of independent Lithuania in Washingtonin case the Soviets prevent them from freely conducting governmentbusiness.   Lithuania, along with its Baltic neighbors Latvia and Estonia,enjoyed independence between the two world wars but was forciblyannexed by the Soviet Union in 1940 as part of a secret Nazi-Sovietpact.   Vilnius was quiet Saturday after the military column rumbledthrough at 4 a.m., a time apparently calculated to avoidconfrontations. A parliament spokesman said he saw the column entera military base at Siaures Miestelis on the north side of thecapital, where it stayed.   ``We're not afraid, but we don't know what they want, and wedon't know what they will do in the next few hours,'' LithuanianPrime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene told reporters at thelegislature.   Many Lithuanians shrugged off the latest show of Soviet force.``We were prepared, and the marching of tanks is nothing for us,''said Arune Taunyte, a graphics designer.   ``We were afraid for 50 years _ but not now,'' said RimasCequolis, a 56-year-old violinist.   There were no reports of Soviet authorities moving in Saturdayto arrest the estimated 900 deserters from the Soviet military,Gorbachev's deadline for their voluntary return to their posts.   ``We cannot physically protect each young man where he ishiding,'' Landsbergis told the parliament. He suggested the youngmen avoid the homes of acquaintances and instead seek sanctuary inchurches, a traditional shelter for fugitives.   At least 28 deserters took refuge in a shelter organized by theLithuanian government at the New Vilnius Psychiatric Hospitaldormitory.   ``We expect that nobody would dare to attack the Red Cross,''said one of deserter there, 20-year-old Darius Baceulis.   If troops do come after them, 19-year-old Arunas Vazinskas said,life would still ``be better in prison than in the army.''   Many deserters have complained they were beaten or harassed bycomrades angry about their republic's drive for independence.   Gorbachev has also demanded that Lithuania stop signing upvolunteer forces and had sought a response from Landsbergis bySaturday.   Landsbergis, in a telegram to Moscow on Saturday, said thevolunteers would not replace Soviet KGB border guards and uniformedpolice, as Gorbachev had suggested.   ``Vremya,'' a Soviet news program, said Saturday night thatInterior Ministry authorities have seized 5,500 weapons inLithuania. Gorbachev had demanded Lithuanians turn in theirfirearms.   The seized weapons included 873 guns that military auxiliaryunits in Kaunus refused to surrender voluntarily, the Sovietprogram said. ``Only the intervention of military units'' enabledauthorities to confiscate the weapons and 516,000 rounds ofammunition, it said. There was no indication of violence in thearms seizure.   Romas Gudaitis, a Lithuanian representative to the nationalparliament in Moscow, said Soviet authorities had rejected aLithuanian request for negotiations.</TEXT></DOC>
