(technical)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Vollum, Charles.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>By the year 2000, parallel processing, a concept already embodiedin the form of viable and cost-effective machines, will dominatecomputer technology.andP;  Software engineers, realizing this, areshifting away from designing sequential algorithms to designingparallel ones.andP;  As languages supporting parallel conceptsproliferate and mature, and as operating systems begin to providedevelopment environments needed to cost-effectively developproduction-quality parallel software, the trend toward writingparallel algorithms will accelerate.andP;  Parallel languages, comingfrom industry or academia, are either extensions to traditionallanguage structures or are brand-new languages that diverge fromsequential traditions.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Parallel ProcessingSoftware DesignComputer software industryProgramming LanguagesTechnology.andM;</DESCRIPT></DOC>
