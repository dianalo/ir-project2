The Hesse state government said there were no radioactive leaksand the local population was not in danger in the accident Thursdayat the Biblis power plant 30 miles south of Frankfurt. The plant hasa history of problems.   The state Environment Ministry said the two cooling systems brokedown after workers tried to fix a cooling water pump. An emergencywater pump also broke down, leaving only two emergency coolingsystems working, the ministry said in a statement.   The reactor's output was reduced, but workers repaired themalfunctioning pump and the unit was never shut down, the ministrysaid. The cause was not immediately known, it said.   ``There was no danger for the workers or for the environment,''said ministry spokeswoman Annette Grossbongardt. ``No radioactivitywas released.''   But the opposition Social Democrats and Greens parties in theHesse state legislature accused the ministry of playing an``irresponsible game with the safety of the populace'' by keepingthe reactor running while the cause of the malfunction was unknown.   Ernst Welteke, a Social Democratic leader in the Hesselegislature, said the same unit of the Biblis plant had 175 recordedmalfunctions between 1975 and 1988, according to official governmentdocuments.   Several Social Democrats and Greens said the plant, one of theoldest in West Germany, should be shut down.   In December 1987, a small amount of radioactive steam wasreleased from the plant into the atmosphere. The accident caused apublic outcry when it was disclosed a year later.</TEXT></DOC>
