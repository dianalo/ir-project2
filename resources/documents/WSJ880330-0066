Salwen </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> STK NDX </IN><TEXT>   Stock prices posted a broad advance yesterday, bolstered by a stronger U.S. dollar, a rebound in bond prices and gains in overseas equity markets.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 18.57 points to close at 1998.34, as New York Stock Exchange advancing issues outpaced losers by 1,024 to 478. Big Board volume accelerated slightly from Monday's slow pace, as 152.7 million shares changed hands, up from 142.8 million.    Stock prices jumped at the opening bell as traders took note of the firming dollar and gains in the Tokyo stock market. U.S. equity prices added somewhat to their gains in the afternoon before slipping back near the close of trading.    &quot;It's a low-conviction market that's reacting to day-to-day events,&quot; asserted Michael Metz, chief market strategist at Oppenheimer andamp; Co., New York. &quot;With the economic fundamental background being so ambiguous, anxiety is high.&quot;    Ernest Rudnet, a trader at Mabon, Nugent, said that the stock market is showing signs of weakness despite yesterday's gains. &quot;It's more of a trading rally than one I'd call a real rally,&quot; he contended.    Mr. Rudnet cited the weakness in the technology sector, mainly International Business Machines, which dropped 2 1/4 to 105 7/8, and Digital Equipment, which lost 1 1/4 to close at 105 3/8. &quot;When you see IBM down and Digital lagging, you couldn't call this a real rally,&quot; he said.    Peter DaPuzzo, the head of retail equity trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton, said market psychology was aided by the Japanese support of the dollar, which in turn bolstered U.S. bond prices. But he agreed that the lagging technology stocks are likely to keep the overall market from posting sharp gains.    Several analysts said they saw a lack of institutional interest and practically no foreign buying. Both groups of investors &quot;are heading for safety and they don't want any more negative surprises,&quot; Mr. Metz said. &quot;We're missing one of the major elements of support.&quot;    But Mr. Metz and others said they see that as a bullish sign. &quot;Eventually the cash will be recommitted to the market,&quot; Mr. Metz said. &quot;The big question is when and at what level.&quot;    A.C. Moore, research director at Argus Research Corp., adds that mutual funds are sitting on large cash hoards, which they also should eventually reinvest.    But Scott Black, president of Delphi Management, a Boston money management firm, is far less optimistic. &quot;I think the market's still overpriced here,&quot; he argued.    Mr. Black advises individual investors to &quot;get into short-term cash equivalents&quot; rather than pay the relatively high valuations of most stocks. He suggests that investors &quot;wait it out until you see better valuations for stocks.&quot;    He says he is looking almost exclusively at special-situations stocks for investment opportunities. &quot;You can't say industrywide that here's a specific group that's undervalued,&quot; he contended.    Bankers Trust led the most-active list for the second consecutive day. More than nine million shares of the banking concern's common have traded in the past two days, mainly on dividend-capture activity, traders said. The stock closed at 31 1/2, off 1/4, on volume of 5.8 million shares.    Texaco shares jumped 3 1/4 to 48 on trading of more than three million shares after buy-out specialist Kohlberg Kravis Roberts said it will ask for federal approval to acquire as much as 15% of the oil company's stock. A Kohlberg Kravis spokesman said an affiliate currently holds nearly 12 million Texaco shares, or slightly less than 5% of the common outstanding.    Stock buy-back programs pushed several issues sharply higher. RJR Nabisco soared 4 1/8 to 52 1/8 on hefty volume of 2.2 million shares; the company announced late Monday that it will purchase as much as 8% of its common for $52 to $58 a share. Analysts took that as a signal that the tobacco and food company wasn't planning an acquisition that would dilute per-share profit.    In conjunction, investors bid up the shares of Philip Morris, another tobacco and food company; the stock gained 2 1/8 to 91. Merrill Lynch also raised its rating on the issue.    Georgia-Pacific stock added 1 1/8 to 36 1/4 on volume of nearly 1.7 million shares after the lumber company expanded its buy-back program.    Russ Togs, a wholesale apparel maker, jumped 1 3/8 to 17 1/2 on rumors of a leveraged buy-out. Russ Togs executives said they have no plans for such a buy-out and aren't aware of any outside bidders.    Rhodes Inc., a furniture retailer, said it is in talks with potential buyers it didn't identify; Rhodes stock gained 1 1/2 to 21 1/4.    Familiar takeover stories stayed at the forefront. Federated Department Stores gained 1 1/8 to 69 7/8 after the retailer set a deadline of today for final bids from suitors Campeau and R.H. Macy.    Lucky Stores rose 1 1/4 to 49 7/8 after American Stores said it is considering sweetening its bid to $50 a share from $45 for the supermarket chain. Gillette continued its roller-coaster ride, dropping 1 5/8 to 43 1/2 after a fierce run-up last week on takeover rumors.    Chemical stocks posted solid gains. Du Pont rose 7/8 to 81 1/4; Union Carbide gained 3/4 to 23 5/8; Dow Chemical increased 1 5/8 to 83 3/4 and Monsanto climbed 1 1/4 to 81 1/2.    The American Depositary Receipts of several Japanese companies soared. Hitachi Ltd. rose 6 1/2 to 115; Matsushita Electric gained 7 3/4 to 214 1/4 and Honda Motor increased 3 1/2 to 137 1/2.    Sundstrand Corp. dropped 1 1/4 to 52 after reports that the company has agreed to plead guilty to a felony charge and pay the U.S. $12.5 million for overcharging on military work by a subsidiary.    Bank of New York gained 7/8 to 31 5/8 after a Bear Stearns analyst added the stock to the firm's recommended list, saying the bank will become a takeover target if it can't successfully buy Irving Bank. </TEXT></DOC>
