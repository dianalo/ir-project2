Two of the latest targets were teachers' unions and a third was astudent group that coordinated anti-government protests this year inmixed-race townships near Cape Town.   The fourth banned group was the National Detainees Forum,established in July to carry on monitoring work that had beenconducted by the Detainees Parents Support Committee before itsbanning in February.   Both watchdog groups have played a major role in providinginformation on the thousands of activists, most of them black,detained without charge for varying periods during the 30-month-oldstate of emergency.   A statement issued on behalf of Law and Order Minister AdriaanVlok said the predominantly black Democratic Teachers Union and thepredominantly mixed-race Western Cape Teachers Union had promoted``people's education'' _ an effort by non-white communities to exertgreater control over curriculum in their schools.   A year ago, the Cabinet minister for black education, GerritViljoen, said the government saw important positive elements inpeople's education. But Lt. Peet Bothma, a spokesman for Vlok, saidThursday that the concept was inspired by the outlawed AfricanNational Congress guerrilla movement.   The two teachers' unions, both founded in 1985, were``politicizing education and discrediting the education system,''said Bothma. ``Both are involved in the broad revolutionaryonslaught against South Africa which could escalate into strikes,boycotts, terror and unrest incidents.''   Bothma said the government had similar concerns about thepredominantly mixed-race Western Cape Students Congress, one of adozen youth and student groups banned this year.   Thousands of mixed-race students around Cape Town, in some casessupported by faculty, staged a widespread classroom boycott in Aprilto protest detentions and harassment of students and teachers.   The latest bannings were denounced by South Africa's Human RightsCommission. It described the government as ``power-drunk'' and saidthat only 24 organizations had been banned in a 37-year periodbefore 1988.   The newly banned organizations ``have never been accused in courtof any illegal actions,'' the commission said in a statement.``Their bannings are a result of their steadfast opposition toapartheid policies.''   The 17 groups affected by the initial banning orders in Februaryincluded the largest anti-apartheid coalition, the United DemocraticFront, and a nationwide black-consciousness group, the AzanianPeople's Organization.   The main anti-apartheid labor federation, the Congress of SouthAfrican Trade Unions, was prohibited from political activity as partof the crackdown, although it has not muted its criticism of thegovernment.   But much of the above-ground leadership of the anti-apartheidmovement has shifted to an alliance of clergymen, including AnglicanArchbishop Desmond Tutu and the Rev. Allan Boesak, president of theWorld Alliance of Reformed Churches.   The country's main mixed-race political party Thursday ended itsannual conference with a pledge to seek contacts with the AfricanNational Congress.   Labor Party delegates rejected a proposal to quit Parliament as aprotest against apartheid, but resolved to take more initiative inworking with non-parliamentary groups to undermine the whitegovernment's racial policies.   Parliament has chambers for whites, Asians and people of mixedrace, but the black majority is excluded.</TEXT></DOC>
