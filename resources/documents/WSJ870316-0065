As previously reported, Purolator's directors two weeks ago agreed to a leveraged buyout proposal made by a management group to acquire the company for $35-a-share in cash and securities. E.F. Hutton Group Inc. is to provide as much as $279 million in financing for the transaction.    In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely with borrowing. Ultimately the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or the sale of its assets.    The lawsuit, filed last week in New Jersey's Superior Court by Rodney Shields of Chandler, Ariz., also names officers and directors of the package delivery concern and the investment banking firm E.F. Hutton. The lawsuit asked the court to bar the defendants from going ahead with the transaction.    A spokesman for Purolator, Basking Ridge, N.J., said the company had no comment on the lawsuit. A spokesman for E.F. Hutton also declined to comment.    The lawsuit accuses Purolator's directors of underestimating the value of its assets. Purolator and E.F. Hutton &quot;have conspired in a manipulative scheme to freeze out Purolator's public shareholders . . . and to obtain for certain of themselves unfairly enriching benefits,&quot; the suit charges.    As previously reported, a director of Purolator resigned last week to seek other bids for the company. Dorsey R. Gardner, the former director, characterized the buyout proposal as &quot;a terrible deal for shareholders.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
