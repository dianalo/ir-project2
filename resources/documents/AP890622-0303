The three are First Federal Savings and Loan Association,Americus; Habersham Federal Savings Bank, Atlanta, and GreatSouthern Federal Savings Bank in Savannah. They have combined assetsof about $1.03 billion.   In a legal maneuver to protect the institutions' assets from theclaims of subordinated debt holders, the government seized theassets and transferred them to newly created entities, called FirstSavings of Americus, Habersham Federal Savings and Loan Associationand Great Southern Federal Savings and Loan Association.   Since early February, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. hasbeen taking over the most deeply insolvent Sandamp;Ls in preparation forcongressional passage of President Bush's Sandamp;L bailout.
