Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser (D., Tenn.)said Democrats want to aim for a package of spending cuts andtax increases that would total $550 billion to $600 billionin the fiscal years 1991 through 1995.</LP><TEXT>   But White House and Republican congressional negotiatorsresisted, questioning the wisdom of rushing to set afive-year goal without any discussion of the policies such agoal would entail, participants said. Some Republicans leantoward a five-year goal closer to the $420 billion, five-yearfigure set in President Bush's budget.   The dispute illustrates the political obstacles the summitfaces. Democrats say they want to wipe out the deficit overfive years without relying on the Social Security surplus, atarget that would require deep spending cuts and large taxincreases. They fear the White House simply wants a pact toget past the 1992 election.   Republicans are concentrating on achieving a solidfirst-year deficit-reduction package of $50 billion or so,and are in less of a hurry to pin down a five-year target.They fear the Democrats are trying to lock them into a bigtax increase or are maneuvering to avoid blame should thetalks break down.   &quot;People had different views on what should be done,&quot; saidHouse Majority Leader Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.).   Others stressed that the talks remain in what White HouseBudget Director Richard Darman has called &quot;the seminarstage.&quot; Sen. Wyche Fowler (D., Ga.), said flatly: &quot;We are notin negotiation.&quot;   An administration official, who asked not to be named,said, &quot;We all agree: `Let's get something responsible.' Westill haven't decided what `responsible' is.&quot;   Participants said the two sides are talking about aimingfor a first-year package of spending cuts and tax increasesof between $45 billion and $60 billion, a significant sum,but one that would still require altering the Gramm-Rudmandeficit-reduction law.   Negotiators set two full days of meetings for June 6 and7, after Congress returns from its Memorial Day recess, toexamine federal spending and revenues in greater detail.Negotiators haven't agreed how to proceed after that, butnegotiators on both sides say they hope to begin hardbargaining promptly.   &quot;The political parties agree that it's far better to seeif we can try to accelerate this,&quot; House Budget Chairman LeonPanetta (D., Calif.) said. Uncertainty over the summit isalready complicating congressional campaigns becausecandidates are taking positions on taxes and spending.   Before yesterday's meeting, President Bush charged thatinaction by Congress has created the current impasse over thebudget deficit, and again refused to offer any detailedsolution of his own.   In a news conference, Mr. Bush deflected suggestions thathe make a televised statement to the American peopleexplaining why the summit is necessary. Lawmakers would bedisappointed if he gave the issue such a high profile now, hesuggested, because he would note &quot;the fact that the Congressappropriates all the money and raises all the revenues.That's their obligation.&quot; Moreover, he asserted that recentpolls indicate &quot;that people understand that the Congressbears a greater responsibility for this.&quot;   Democrats were quick to respond. &quot;It's the first time inthis century we've seen a president want to give power to theCongress,&quot; Mr. Gephardt said. &quot;The president is wrong if hethinks the budget is more our responsibility than his.&quot;   Meanwhile, Mr. Bush continued to hear from Republicans whowant him to avoid agreeing to raise taxes. Outspoken tax foesRep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the No. 2 Republican in theHouse, and Rep. Vin Weber of Minnesota, joined by HouseRepublican Leader Robert Michel of Illinois, met at the WhiteHouse with Mr. Bush and administration budget negotiators.   At the session at the Capitol, Budget Director Darman gavenegotiators updated deficit forecasts incorporating thelatest Treasury estimates of the cost of cleaning up thethrift industry. For fiscal 1991, the budget office sees adeficit of between $179 billion and $205.8 billion, wellabove the $64 billion Gramm-Rudman target. This includesthrift spending of all sorts of between $41.1 and $67.9billion. For the current year, the budget office now sees adeficit of $181 billion to $202.7 billion, including $26billion to $47.7 billion in thrift costs.   The forecasts rely on revised economic projections thatare subject to change again before the July 15 forecastrequired by the Gramm-Rudman law. The budget office nowestimates inflation-adjusted economic growth of 2.9% betweenthe fourth quarters of 1990 and 1991, down from its Januaryforecast of 3.3%. Compared with its earlier forecast, it nowsees slightly higher inflation and significantly higherinterest rates for this year and next. It also is forecastingsubstantially lower corporate profits for each of the nextfive years.   The budget office now forecasts rates on three-monthTreasury bills will average 7.7% in 1990 and 6.8% in 1991,compared with its earlier forecast of 6.7% and 5.4%. Itforecasts rates on 10-year Treasury notes at 8.6% for 1990and 8% for 1991, compared with 7.7% and 6.8% in its earlierforecast.</TEXT></DOC>
