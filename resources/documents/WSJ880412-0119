Oil prices surged in the wake of a weekend decision by five oil ministers to meet April 23 with several non-OPEC exporters to consider a joint effort aimed at curbing the world oil glut. Although the latest effort may come to nothing, it was another occasion on which the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries caused prices to jump merely by scheduling a meeting.    &quot;It was ingenious,&quot; said Paul Mlotok, international oil analyst at New York-based Salomon Brothers Inc. &quot;They have absolutely cut off the (market) downside for April, which could have been their worst month this year.&quot;    The bid for an alliance of OPEC and non-OPEC oil exporters was initiated by eight producing countries outside the cartel. Just how committed either group may be to sharing production cuts to prop up the price of oil remains in doubt. There were conflicting reports, for example, on whether the 13 nations of OPEC will even consider reducing their output of nearly 18 million barrels a day at an April 25 conference, following the meeting of the five ministers with the non-OPEC exporters.    Despite the uncertainty, world petroleum prices rose sharply yesterday. On European spot markets, Brent crude traded at $16.40 a barrel late in the day, up 70 cents since Friday. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate closed at a four-month high of $17.89 a barrel, up $1.01.    Similar jumps in oil prices -- which had declined as much as $4 a barrel this year -- followed the March 23 announcement of last Saturday's meeting of the five ministers on OPEC's price-monitoring committee. Prices since have dropped back some but still remain higher than before the announcement. Actual prices of OPEC's crudes currently average $14.50 a barrel, compared with the official benchmark of $18.    Oil prices should now remain relatively firm until the results are known from the late April meeting, industry officials said. A lack of accomplishment then could be negative for oil markets. But yet another OPEC meeting -- the regular midyear ministerial conference -- will be only a few weeks away starting June 8.    &quot;We will keep the market in suspense,&quot; said an oil minister who attended the weekend price panel meeting.    The oil exporters still could face problems next month, but oil economists generally expect a strengthening of oil markets soon from the indicated rise in world petroleum demand. The Paris-based International Energy Agency estimates 1988 world oil demand will average 49.2 million barrels a day, up from 48.6 million last year.    &quot;OPEC could have one month of difficulties now,&quot; said Mr. Mlotok, &quot;but the fundamentals start turning strongly to the positive side by the end of May.&quot; Mr. Mlotok previously projected the price of West Texas Intermediate would reach $20 a barrel in the second half. If OPEC and non-OPEC exporters reduce production by the recommended 900,000 barrels a day at the late April meetings, &quot;We will just get to $20 a little earlier,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
