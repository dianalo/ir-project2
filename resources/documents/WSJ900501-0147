Instead, it got egg on its face.</LP><TEXT>   The Intelligent Manufacturing System proposed by Japan isa 10-year project to integrate existing factory technologiesfrom the major industrialized countries, to develop aworld-wide standard for future factory technologies, and topool international resources to create &quot;21st century&quot;high-tech systems. The project, in the form of a consortium,would include governments, companies and universities.   Cut from the famous Japanese industrial-policy mold, theproposed consortium has intrigued U.S. companies that can'tget similar backing for such programs at home. But it hastriggered an uproar in the U.S. and Europe, where someofficials say it smacks of a Japanese Trojan horse to takeover the world economy.   Early last week, the Commerce Department hosted acontentious meeting near Washington on the project with about50 U.S. industry representatives. On Thursday, an assistantsecretary of commerce blasted the program at a congressionalhearing. Commerce officials plan to raise their concerns atan annual meeting on bilateral science and technologyexchange this week.   &quot;We are very disturbed by the way the Japanese approachedthis,&quot; says a senior Commerce official. &quot;They don't want alevel playing field. They want to target our industries.&quot;European Community officials echo those sentiments.   The Japanese, who for years have been berated for keepingresearch closed to outsiders, profess bemusement. &quot;When we donothing, we are criticized. When we do something, we arecriticized,&quot; sighs Takeshi Isayama, director of theindustrial machinery division of the Ministry ofInternational Trade and Industry, or MITI, which is helpingfund the project.   As the governments feud, United Technologies Corp. andRockwell International Corp. are signing up for the project,and others have indicated interest. With the Bushadministration dead set against anything that smacks of anindustrial policy, some companies say, Americans looking forsuch assistance might as well get it from the Japanese.   &quot;If our government isn't doing equally visionary things,what would they have us do?&quot; asks Stanley P. Krueger,president of United Technologies' Japan office. &quot;We can't sitstill in the U.S., turn off the lights and send our employeeshome.&quot;   Leo Reddy, president of the National Coalition forAdvanced Manufacturing in Washington, says he has seriousconcerns about the program, but adds: &quot;They're putting up themoney, our government isn't. It's a metaphor for our time, aSputnik. It dramatically underlines the fact the Japanese aretaking manufacturing very seriously.&quot;   All these issues are likely to come up with growingfrequency, as the manufacturing consortium is just one ofmany the Japanese government is opening up to foreigncompanies. Last year, General Electric Co. and UnitedTechnologies' Pratt andamp; Whitney subsidiary signed up for a MITIproject to develop a high-speed jet engine. That raisedhackles about the possibility that the U.S. companies wouldleak technology in a field where the U.S. still has theadvantage. But, remarkably enough, it also brought togethertwo longtime bitter rivals to work on a project.   The consortium was the brainchild of Hiroyuki Yoshikawa,dean of Tokyo University's Faculty of Engineering and anexpert on manufacturing. The effort he began coordinatinglast year now has 80 major Japanese companies on board.   Dr. Yoshikawa's philosophy, outlined in the programbrochure, is that international cooperation in manufacturingbecomes essential as the shortage of skilled labor world-widerequires more factory automation and technology costs rise.Among other things, standardization simplifies applyingknow-how around the world.   Japan has long conducted industrial research this way.Government-corporate-university consortia helped Japan catchup in semiconductors and take the lead in high-definitiontelevision. Such projects have been seen as vehicles fornational development, and closed to outsiders.   But foreigners' lack of access to Japanese research is asource of international tension. In the West, the mostimportant scientific work takes place in open universitylaboratories, something the Japanese have diligently takenadvantage of. But in Japan, most work is done in closedcorporate facilities, and in closed consortia.   A 1988 U.S.-Japan science and technology agreement wasmeant to address such issues. Last year, Japan started theHuman Frontier Science Project, based in Strasbourg, France,to fund international research. And Japan has been opening upmore of its own projects. Its superconductivity lab has nineforeign corporate members. Last year, MITI opened all itsmajor consortia to foreign companies. In addition to theengine project, it invited outsiders to help researchunderground construction.   MITI and Japanese companies will put up $600 million forthe manufacturing consortium in the next decade, with $200million each from the U.S. and Europe. An internationalresearch center will be set up in Europe or North America.   Japanese researchers and government officials briefedrepresentatives of foreign companies and embassies in Tokyoin January. The response was enthusiastic. But when wordfiltered back to the U.S. and Europe, the reaction wascooler.   U.S. Commerce officials say the way the Japanese havepursued the project hints of trying to sneak around officialchannels. While the Japanese made some low-level U.S.government contacts, they mainly have approached U.S.industry directly, signing up the Society of ManufacturingEngineers as the U.S. coordinator. When Commerce officialscomplained to the Japanese Embassy in Washington last month,they were told it was a Japanese private industry project.   The European Community has had tighter control over directJapanese contact with companies. But it too has expressedsimilar concerns. A few weeks ago, EC officials met withCommerce officials to compare notes and responses.   To some Westerners, the Japanese have a reason foravoiding government contacts: the project, they say, isstructured to allow Japanese companies to suck up advancedWestern know-how. While Japan may already use more robots,they say, the West is ahead in systems integration andcomputer software.   &quot;It is directed at one of the few remaining areas wherethe U.S. retains technological superiority,&quot; James L. Koontz,president of Kingsbury Corp. and chairman of the NationalCenter for Manufacturing Sciences, testified before a Senatecommitee last month. &quot;We would lose.&quot; Others argue that evenif everybody shares the technology, Japan will be the mainbeneficiary because its companies are much quicker aboutputting new techniques to use.   To the Japanese, the project is a noble gesture. Afterall, they say, study after study proclaims the U.S. is losingits manufacturing prowess, while Japan pulls further ahead.In fact, Japanese officials say they had to fight to convinceJapanese companies to participate. Says MITI's Mr. Isayama,&quot;A lot complained: Why do we have to expose our technology tooutsiders?&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
