Perry (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> EXE </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   &quot;They think they'll clean our clock,&quot; says Roger Ailes, pointing north, in the general direction of Boston and Michael Dukakis's campaign headquarters.    &quot;But,&quot; he adds, &quot;the vice president will do all right.&quot;    Mr. Ailes is George Bush's main media man, and he is talking about Sunday night's opening debate at Wake Forest University between the two presidential candidates. Mr. Ailes is coaching Mr. Bush, and it's his job to make sure the sometimes maladroit vice president does &quot;all right.&quot;    Deep down, the Bush people believe they'll do better than all right. They don't worry about their man's debating techniques, given the restricted format of this debate. They are concentrating on one-liners and the ineffable &quot;sound bites,&quot; the carefully rehearsed zingers that get on the evening news and leave a lasting impression in the minds of the voters. Roger Ailes is the zinger-meister.    The stakes are considerable. Mr. Ailes likes to play down the first debate -- it's part of the Bush strategy -- but both campaigns know that if the Massachusetts governor doesn't do well, Mr. Bush will walk off the Wake Forest stage as the odds-on choice to win the election.    The portly, bearded Mr. Ailes wants to make sure this happens. He's Mr. Bush's toughest campaign weapon, a battler who once told a slack-jawed colleague, &quot;I'll give my life for a client.&quot; In a campaign run by middle-aged, middle-class men in pin-striped suits and loafers with tassles, he's the odd man out.    He's a legend in his own business, the man who showed Richard Nixon how to use television, the fellow who disposed of two troublesome young thugs in a hotel lobby by tossing one of them into a fountain and breaking the other's wrist. He says they punched him first.    Mr. Ailes isn't giving away any secrets about how he is coaching Mr. Bush -- everyone in the campaign has taken a solemn pledge to keep quiet about the preparations. But Mr. Ailes is nothing if not consistent. He prepares all his candidates the same way.    That's his specialty -- teaching candidates how to perform on TV. Coaching politicians for debates is a specialty within a specialty. &quot;As a coach,&quot; says Bob Goodman of Baltimore, another media consultant, &quot;Roger Ailes is in a class by himself. I send my own clients to him.&quot;    The 48-year-old Mr. Ailes says there are five debate strategies: attack, defend, counterattack, sell or ignore. His first choice, almost always, is attack. And, if attacked, counterattack. Defense, he says, is the weakest strategy of all.    On Sunday night, then, following the Ailes strategy, Mr. Bush will assail the Democratic presidential nominee, probably on dramatic, emotional, easily understood issues. Candidates, Mr. Ailes argues, don't get elected on details. They get elected on broad themes.    He will urge Mr. Bush, as a general rule, to skip over a recitation of facts: They clutter up the message. If asked a specific question, ignore it, basically, and relate the answer to a broad theme -- patriotism, for example, or good economic times or a strong defense.    He already has explained all these debate theories to Mr. Bush. He will go over them again. He will try to relax the GOP candidate and at the same time raise his level of confidence.    He won't require Mr. Bush to memorize details about everything. That, he figures, is where President Reagan went wrong in his first debate with Democrat Walter Mondale in 1984. Mr. Reagan was crammed with so much information that he became confused and flustered, and endless mock debates only made matters worse.    Mr. Ailes prefers what he calls &quot;pepper drills&quot; -- in which he will fire questions at Mr. Bush and give him no more than 90 seconds to come up with the answers. The kinds of answers he prefers, he will explain, are those that grow out of Mr. Bush's experience.    Finally, hours before the debate, Mr. Ailes will meet alone with Mr. Bush and run through the strategy one more time -- &quot;how to go on offense, when to move, what to hit on.&quot;    It worked with Mr. Reagan four years ago. It has worked so far this year with Mr. Bush. The Reagan experience is a nice illustration of the Ailes technique.    &quot;What the American people wanted from the president (in the second debate), I felt,&quot; Mr. Ailes recalls in his book, &quot;You Are the Message,&quot; &quot;was some reassurance he wasn't too old for the job.&quot;    The first thing Mr. Ailes did was tell the people around Mr. Reagan to get off his back. And then he asked Mr. Reagan the question no one else had dared to ask: &quot;Mr. President, what are you going to do when they say you're too old for the job?&quot;    Mr. Reagan, he says, &quot;stopped cold and blinked. Silence.&quot;    And then the president remembered a line he had used years before, something about how he wouldn't make age an issue in the campaign, he wouldn't exploit his opponent's youth and inexperience. Perfect, Mr. Ailes told him, and the president suddenly seemed to grow in self-confidence. Mr. Reagan used the line, and it was a zinger. The game was over.    Mr. Ailes has had his moments with Mr. Bush too. Last October, in a Republican debate, Mr. Bush turned sarcastically on his chief tormentor, former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont, and called him by his given name, Pierre. It was an Ailes-inspired put-down.    And it was Mr. Ailes who supplied Mr. Bush with the zinger that devastated anchorman Dan Rather on national TV. &quot;It's not fair,&quot; the vice president said in the interview, &quot;to judge my whole career by a rehash of Iran,&quot; referring to the Iran-Contra affair. &quot;How would you like it if I judged your career by those seven minutes when you walked off the set in New York?&quot;    Preparing for Sunday's debate, Mr. Bush's poll taker, Robert Teeter, has been using fancy electronic hook-ups testing the effects of possible one-liners on panels of prospective voters. But Mr. Ailes says he isn't sure he has read the results. &quot;I go with my gut,&quot; he says. &quot;Why do I need to go out in the street and hire 20 amateurs to tell me what works or doesn't work?&quot;    The strategy in setting up this debate has been simplicity itself. Foremost, make a Bush victory more likely by lowering expectations about Mr. Bush as a debater. Mr. Ailes is doing everything he can to convince reporters that Mr. Dukakis &quot;is the greatest debater in America today&quot; and that poor Mr. Bush is badly overmatched. So if Mr. Bush simply survives, he wins.    The truth is, Mr. Dukakis isn't so great at debates. In 1978, when he was beaten in the Democratic primary while seeking re-election as governor, he was sacked in the only debate of the primary campaign by his conservative opponent, Ed King, a former professional football player. In multiple-candidate debates during the presidential primaries this year, he was always adequate but rarely brilliant.    And Mr. Bush, for all of Mr. Ailes's calculated put-downs, isn't so bad -- when he has been carefully coached. He'll be well-coached Sunday night, and somewhere early in the debate he will unload a zinger. It will be the Ailes touch. </TEXT></DOC>
