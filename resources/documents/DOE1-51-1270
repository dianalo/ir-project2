<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-51-1270 </DOCNO><TEXT>Pelvic angiography (PAG) by Seldinger is one of the most useful examinationsfor the diagnosis of trophoblastic disease and also for the assessmentof the therapeutic results. This technique, however, causes some stressto the patient. Therefore, noninvasive method, such as computed tomography(CT) and ultrasonography (USG) have recently been introduced. In the1980s, digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was developed. It is nowbeing used increasingly in the fields of Obstetrics and Gynecology asa substitute for the conventional PAG. In this report, the results ofDSA, PAG, CT and USG which were carried out before and after chemotherapyin a patient with invasive hydatidiform mole were compared. In termsof the location, size and shape of the lesion, the CT findings were almostthe same as those of USG. In terms of the angiographic findings in theaffected area, intravenous DSA (IVDSA) was a sufficiently substitutionalexamination for conventional PAG. With IVDSA, arterial images can beobtained following the intravenous injection of a contrast medium. Therefore,this technique is excellent in terms of simplicity and safety. From nowon, DSA will be utilized instead of PAG as an effective diagnostic methodfor trophoblastic disease and for follow-up such cases.</TEXT></DOC>
