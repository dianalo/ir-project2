Diverse organizations have entered this dynamic field, for example, American Express, CBS, Citibank, Dow Jones, Grand Union, Knight-Ridder, Lockheed, Mead, the New York Stock Exchange, J.C. Penney and World Book.    Any company can join these ranks of information-service providers, with the notable exception of seven. These are the Bell operating companies, or so-called &quot;Baby Bells,&quot; formed in 1984 with the court-sanctioned breakup of American Telephone and Telegraph. The terms of the settlement bar them from entering the information-providing business, or from competing with ATandamp;T in the long-distance telephone business. To the chagrin of ATandamp;T and other competitors, the Justice Department now proposes to lift those and other restrictions.    The department recently filed proposals with the federal judge who oversees the consent decree to lift these barriers to competition. The seven Bell companies would be as free as anyone else to enter these businesses, particularly information services. The only remaining restriction would be a ban on providing long-distance services within a Bell company's own assigned region.    ATandamp;T said that Justice &quot;wants to change the rules again and risk recreating the chaos and gridlock that characterized the industry just a few short years ago.&quot; MCI Communications called the move &quot;a flagrant attempt to overturn the nation's antitrust laws.&quot;    We can sympathize, in a way, with ATandamp;T's attitude. In return for ATandamp;T's agreement to the 1982 consent decree ending the Justice Department's longstanding antitrust suit against the telecommunications giant, the government provided some limited protections for &quot;Ma Bell&quot; from its offspring. Now Justice wants to change the rules of that pact.    It's much easier to defend the restrictions on the &quot;Baby Bells&quot; as a matter of history and precedent, however, than to defend them as a matter of current public policy. As Justice said, the current prohibitions on the Bell operating companies are &quot;not necessary to protect competition and may be depriving large parts of our society of the benefits of the information age.&quot; Charles Rule, acting head of Justice's antitrust division, added: &quot;Now is the time for us to get out of the way and not impede competition.&quot;    Take information services. Advances in technology since the time of the decree mean that computers can more easily communicate with each other over telephone lines -- that's especially important now that there are an estimated 12 million home computers in America, apart from the millions of office systems. Other emerging services include automated listings, accessible by telephone, that allow customers to obtain airline schedules; message services; meter readings; alarm monitoring; telephone banking, and home-shopping. That such technology conceptually provides an alternative to newspaper classified advertising makes the newspaper industry a foe of unleashing the Baby Bells.    In this opposition, there is one valid concern that will bear watching and perhaps some special provisions: whether the Baby Bells, which still have a monopoly on local telephone service, can fairly serve as common carriers for competitors of their own information-service offerings. Impairing competitors would violate existing Federal Communications Commission rules, of course, though subtle forms of discrimination might be hard to regulate.    In the long run, however, two factors work against abuse. First, with computerized office phone systems, cable television and the widening use of optic fibers, even local monopolies are far from permanent. And second, the decisive competitive factor in the information-services business will ultimately be the information itself. In providing and processing information the comparative advantage will lie with information businesses-newspaper companies, banks and the likenot with telephone utilities.    Telecommunications is becoming ever more competitive. Technological advances are making archaic the federal prohibitions imposed on the Bell companies only five years ago. Those of us who believe the public is served by free economic competition have to believe that letting everyone compete will speed the delivery of increasingly diverse information services to a more widespread audience. </TEXT></DOC>
