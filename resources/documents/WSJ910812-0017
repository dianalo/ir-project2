As economic development picks up in the province,there is concern that the Irianese, or indigenousMelanesians, are being left behind. With much of the economyin the hands of outsiders, Benny and his companions are partof a swelling rank of young, restless Irianese in Jayapura,the capital.   Better prices for the province's commodities, improvementsin its infrastructure and national economic reforms havesparked outside business interest in a frontier provinceknown mainly as home to tribes still living a Stone Ageexistence. And though some parts of Irian Jaya still appearout of time, others are moving into the modern world. Moreand more companies are arriving to tackle tough terrain todig for minerals, drill for oil and fell trees for plywood.   But analysts, government officials and many Irianese saythat if the widening economic disparity between the Irianeseand immigrants from other parts of the country isn'taddressed soon, Jakarta's medium-term economic gains in IrianJaya could be undercut by long-term political problems. Adecades-old rebellion against Jakarta's rule is barelyevident now, but it could be rekindled if Irianese feeldenied their share in the development of their province.   In Jakarta, more than 2,000 miles away, officials saydeveloping Irian Jaya will take time. They point out that theterritory was wrested from the Netherlands only in 1963.Since then, the government has been bringing health servicesand education to a population that lacked both.   Many Irianese, however, say joining Indonesia has broughttoo many immigrants from other provinces. Usually moreeducated and skilled than the Irianese, these immigrants arebenefiting the most from the nascent economic development.The Rev. Nato Gobaipr, a Christian clergyman in the town ofTimika, on the west coast, reflects a common view when hesays that Irianese &quot;feel like second-class citizens.&quot; He andother Irianese say measures must be taken to ensure that theyaren't pushed further to the economic periphery.   Barnabas Suebu, governor of Irian Jaya, says it will be&quot;dangerous&quot; if Irianese are left out, and he acknowledges afeeling of &quot;frustration&quot; among some Irianese. The 45-year-oldgovernor, himself Irianese, says he is concerned thatdisparities between natives and immigrants might worsen.   A Catholic priest who has lived in Jayapura for more thana decade warns that the gap already is wide enough to causesocial unrest. &quot;It's a real problem,&quot; he says, citing theincreasing frequency of public drunkenness among Irianese inthe capital. &quot;It didn't use to be like this, but there'sgrowing restlessness and more dissatisfied people.&quot;   Gov. Suebu and the priest disagree on how best to help theIrianese. The governor wants to lure more big foreigninvestors like Freeport Indonesia Inc., a unit of NewOrleans-based Freeport McMoRan Copper Co., which has spentmore than $1 billion to mine lucrative deposits of copper andgold in the province. Such investments, he says, can providethe infrastructure the government can't afford, and throughemployment, they can teach the Irianese the skills they need.   But the Catholic priest and many educated Irianese sayrapid modernization will be too traumatic for the indigenouspopulation. &quot;It takes a long time to face the challenge of awhole new world,&quot; says the priest. &quot;You can't demand thingsof people with only 30 years' contact with civilization.&quot;   More important, he says, is that an influx of capital willonly widen the economic gap between Irianese and immigrantsfrom elsewhere in Indonesia. He says investors will continueto bring in workers from other provinces on grounds thattraining Irianese would cost too much. Thus, he says,education and training must be expanded now, before moreinvestors come.   Gov. Suebu, who is generally popular in his province,replies that if the big investors don't come, neither willthe smaller ones that would employ more Irianese. He haslobbied Jakarta, so far without success, to offer specialincentives to draw investment to the province, which heasserts is at about the stage of development Java reached inthe early 19th century.   But any investors of the type Gov. Suebu says are neededto pull the province into the modern era will confrontformidable challenges for years to come. The rugged terrainof Irian Jaya, labeled by a former Dutch resident as a &quot;landof unlimited impossibilities,&quot; has left a fracturedpopulation of about 250 ethnic groups that speak at least asmany languages. Moving inland from the coast near Timika, thetopography changes from malaria-infested mangrove swamps todense rain forest to snowcapped peaks around 15,000 feet high-- in a distance of less than 75 miles.   The province accounts for 21% of Indonesia's total areabut less than 1% of its population. (The population nowstands at 1.6 million, of whom about 30% are immigrants,according to some estimates.) Economists estimate the annualper-capita income in the province at about $200, one-thirdthe national average, but even that figure is distorted byIrian Jaya's lucrative commodity exports.   Hundreds of thousands of highland tribes still livelargely in the Stone Age, using pigs for currency andsubsisting mainly on sweet potatoes. Infant mortality andilliteracy are high, and survival beyond the age of 45remains an achievement.   Irian Jaya also poses a political challenge for Jakarta.Many native Melanesians have never liked being part ofIndonesia. Some say privately that they would be better offwith the independence the Dutch withheld for years but thenpromised just before leaving.   Officials in Jakarta, who see their job as &quot;civilizing&quot;Irian Jaya, have found cultural barriers hard to surmount.The province's Melanesian cultures have little in common withothers in Indonesia, particularly dominant Java.   Irianese distrust of Jakarta was heightened with theimplementation of the government's transmigration program,which began in earnest around 1980. Under the program,thousands of families from overcrowded areas have been movedto the province. Disputes have arisen with tribesmen whosetraditional lands have been set aside for the new arrivals.   Popular sentiments reflect the tension between theIrianese and the migrants. Linus, an Irianese schoolteacherin Jayapura, says, &quot;They {the immigrants} don't give us achance.&quot; But Babar, a taxi driver who came to Jayapura 12years ago from Sulawesi, says Irianese are incapable ofholding down steady jobs. He offers a view expressed often byimmigrants: &quot;When an Irianese gets some money, he uses it onbeer.&quot;   Gov. Suebu endorses special efforts to help Irianese, suchas scholarship programs and vocational training. Otherwise,he says, the Irianese will &quot;always lose in competition&quot; withimmigrants.</TEXT></DOC>
