But the art of making a marriage work appears to have eludedDonald Trump. He and his wife, Ivana, have split after nearly 13years of marriage _ proving once again that money can't buy youlove.   In fact, money is a source of contention between the two,despite a prenuptial agreement under which she was to get custodyof their three children, the Greenwich, Conn., mansion, and $25million.   Trump, 43, is worth considerably more _ $1.7 billion to $4billion, depending on who's counting.   Ivana's lawyer, Michael Kennedy, issued a statement Mondaysaying: ``We do not consider the so-called prenuptial agreement tobe serious. It will have no relevance to a court because it isunconscionable and fraudulent.''   In response, Donald's spokesman said: ``The prenuptial agreementsigned by Donald and Ivana Trump is a long and detailed documentwhich covers all aspects and is 100 percent enforceable in courtsof law. The agreement they have was updated approximately two yearsago. Prior to that, this agreement has been updated on numerousother occasions throughout the years.''   While lawyers and image-makers battle it out with pressreleases, tabloids and TV stations _ always enamored of thetuxedoed Trump and the bejeweled, begowned Ivana _ lap it up.   The New York Post today reported that Donald locked Ivana out ofher office Monday at the Plaza Hotel.   The Post, citing unidentified sources, also reported that someof Ivana's jewelry is missing.   Trump had given her the jobs of running the Plaza and the TrumpCastle in Atlantic City, N.J., for a salary, as he put it, of ``Onedollar plus all the dresses she can buy.''   It was not clear whether Ivana, a former Czechoslovakian skiracer and sometime model who turns 41 next week, will continue withher hotel work.   On Monday, the Post quoted Donald saying that Ivana's ``level ofarrogance has grown steadily worse in recent years. The bottom lineis I don't want to create another Leona Helmsley.''   Mrs. Helmsley is the self-described hotel queen recentlyconvicted of tax evasion; at her trial, former employees describedher as ill-tempered and demanding.   ``I have told Ivana, `Whatever Leona would do, do the opposite.Be nice to everybody.' And she is nice, anyway,'' Trump toldPlayboy magazine in an interview in the March issue.   Nice aside, Trump told columnist Liz Smith, who broke the storyof the breakup in Sunday's Daily News: ``It is better for Ivana andme to separate at this time. But I am leaving because I want toleave.   ``Ivana is a wonderful woman and a very good woman and I likeher. We might even get back together. I can't say we won't. ... Andas for those other women I have been linked with, well, I want tosay that we are all just friends and that's as far as it goes,''Trump said.   Pictures of those other women were plastered across a page ofthe New York Post: actresses Catherine Oxenberg and Marla Maplesand skater Peggy Fleming across the top of a page.   New York newspapers trotted out _ as evidence of trouble inTrump paradise _ the story of Ivana, in an Aspen restaurant overthe holidays, reportedly warning Maples, a former Miss Georgiarunnerup and star of a movie called ``Maximum Overdrive,'' to stayaway from Donald. The Trumps were then seen arguing on the slopes.   A few days later, Maples reportedly told Ivana: ``I love him andif you don't, why don't you let him go?'' the Post said.</TEXT></DOC>
