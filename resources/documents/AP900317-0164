When the Exxon Valdez ran aground on Bligh Reef 4 minutes intoMarch 24, 1989, and leaked almost 11 million gallons of Alaskacrude into the sea, the resulting destruction numbed the mind.   Every statistic set a record.   Searchers bagged 34,400 dead seabirds. Thousands more simplydisappeared. At least 1,000 sea otters died; 151 eagles were lost;1,100 miles of shoreline was soaked with oil. No one yet knows theimpact on salmon fry that swam away from hatcheries through thecrude _ will they come back when it's their turn? What about theherring? The long-term impact on whales and bears?   The human impact equaled an invasion force. An army of animalrescuers, beach cleaners, rock scrubbers, bureaucrats, experts,more experts, foreign experts, even tourists, descended upon PrinceWilliam Sound.   In Valdez, Seward, Cordova, Homer, Kodiak and all the villagesalong the soiled seacoast, grocery boys, exhausted phone workers,carpenters, fishermen, merchants, housewives, schoolchildren,veterinarians, police officers and educators found their livesupside down, inside out.   Yet amid all the statistics and clamor, behind all thefinger-pointing and 150 civil lawsuits, individual memories aretraced in the grease and grief.   Here are the voices of four Alaskans, people whose lives werechanged by what happened that frigid, clear Good Friday in PrinceWilliam Sound.</TEXT><HEAD>The Park Ranger</HEAD><TEXT>   Two glass jars of congealed tar sit on Anne Castellina's desk atthe Seward headquarters of Kenai Fjords National Park. They arestinking reminders of carcasses, tears, lost sleep and disruptedlives, all left in the deadly wake of the Exxon Valdez.   One jar's contents were collected soon after oil blackened themagnificent coastline Ms. Castellina, as Kenai Fjordssuperintendent, is charged to protect. The other was filled lastfall, eight months after the crude came ashore. The stench fromboth is gut-wrenching. The difference in the second jar lies in theresidue of dead flesh and a just-recognizable feather.   Ms. Castellina remembers:   ``I didn't have any idea what was coming, I just knew we weregetting sucked into it very fast. Our staff meeting on March 30thwas the last sane time for nine months. When I saw the phone maninstalling 25 lines and dragging in a huge Xerox machine, I knew wewere cookin'.''   Kenai Fjords is Ms. Castellina's first assignment as chief of anational park. At 39, she is a 13-year park service veteran, withpast assignments in Virginia, Florida and New York.   ``The oil hit April 10th. It was the worst day of my life. Icouldn't believe how bad it was. It was the daily 6 p.m. briefingof the Multi Agency Coordinating (MAC) Group. Our weatherman stoodup and said, `Today we had impacts on the headlands of AialikPeninsula.'   ``I just lost it. My mind blanked. I was stunned. ... That nightI could hardly talk. I had an overwhelming feeling of guilt. That'smy park and I didn't stop the oil from hitting it. ... I hadirrational thoughts then, and I don't think those feelings willever go away completely.''   A divorced mother of three adopted sisters from Costa Rica, Ms.Castellina's personal life evaporated.   ``I used to work 8-to-5 with an hour for lunch. Suddenly, Inever got home before 9 or 10. A baby sitter took a cab to my houseevery day at 3 p.m., cooked my kids' dinner, got them bathed and inbed. She didn't drive so I'd give her cash and she'd go to thegrocery store in a cab. My taxes didn't get done until late May. Iremember sitting there thinking, `I don't have the energy to dothis and, besides, it's not important. The IRS can wait.' I paid ahuge late penalty.''   Ms. Castellina was head of the Seward MAC group, a crisiscommittee encompassing local, state and federal agencies.   ``I gave up worrying about my career about the time the CoastGuard threatened to take my job. Exxon and the Coast Guard keptsaying, `You don't have a problem here,' but when Sen. Ted Stevens(R-Alaska) showed up he said, `You guys have got a problem here,'and we said, `Yes, we know.'   ``That's when (MAC) got in the oil booming business. We tookunilateral action. It was a really scary time. (The InteriorDepartment in) Washington was screaming, but Anchorage alwaysbacked me up; they were a tremendous buffer even though they weretaking it in the shorts.   ``I decided the hell with it. If I get fired, I get fired. I'vegot to go on instinct and what the scientific data tells me. Icouldn't second-guess my decisions. If I'd done that I'd have lostmy mind.''   Kenai Fjords has seven permanent employees and six to 12 summerworkers to oversee 670,000 acres and 400 miles of coastline.   ``My staff was falling apart. One person withdrew from spillactivity, just couldn't handle it. Another who was out in the fieldmost of the summer saw his marriage fall apart. ... Meanwhile,77,000 visitors arrived and had to be served properly. I got aseries of bladder infections and lived on antibiotics. But mystress-caused asthma cleared up. Funny, huh?''   Since then, Ms. Castellina has been elected to the board of theChamber of Commerce. The Seward Phoenix Log newspaper recentlyselected her Citizen of the Year. Interior Secretary Manuel LujanJr. flew in on an inspection tour and presented her with theInterior Department Honor Award.   ``I'm a lot less naive. I'm less able to take things at facevalue because of all the broken promises. I've matured in myunderstanding of the political aspects of disasters.   ``I now hear myself saying to my younger, firebrand colleagues,`Don't worry about it, we'll get it worked out.' I am trying to beconsistent and keep my integrity, because more of the same iscoming at us again this summer as we try once again to clean thismess up.''</TEXT><HEAD>The Mayor</HEAD><TEXT>   ``Before the spill, I had it made,'' said John Devens. ``I was areasonably popular mayor who'd served longer than anybody everelected. I was a college president with a good income and real goodstatus. I had a charter boat operator's license and ran a littleaudiology practice on the side. I had as near a perfect life as youcould have.''   Remembering times before March 24, 1989, Devens allows a traceof wistfulness into his voice, as though he's describing an oldfriend who's moved away.   He was mayor of Valdez from 1984 until last October, when hedecided not to run again. He presided over a town of 3,500, a placenicknamed ``The Switzerland of Alaska'' because of mountains andglaciers that tumble into the sea. Home of the tanker terminal forthe trans-Alaska oil pipeline, Valdez was America's richest cityper capita when oil prices were at their peak.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
