As you must know by now, we're not talking about the manwho painted the Sistine Chapel, or your eight-year-old childdressed up as a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle. The Michelangeloof the moment is a sinister bit of software rigged to kick inat the stroke of midnight last night, wiping out all the datainside a PC as soon as it's turned on.</LP><TEXT>   The world will find out today whether Michelangelo is agenuine plague or just a digital common cold. But alreadyMichelangelo-mania qualifies as the greatest high-techhysteria to grip the nation since Skylab fell out of the skyin 1979.   All week, Nightline, McNeil-Lehrer and hundreds of otherTV shows and newspapers have been on Michelangelo watch. Likeair-raid monitors warning how to duck and cover during anattack, computer experts have been demonstrating how topractice &quot;safe computing&quot; by administering software&quot;vaccines&quot; with names like PC-cillin and PCrx.   McAfee Associates, the No. 1 vendor of anti-virussoftware, has been logging 2,500 calls a day for the pastweek. Cable News Network was planning to broadcast live fromMcAfee's Santa Clara, Calif., office throughout today.   &quot;People are really coming unglued,&quot; the company's chief,John McAfee, said yesterday in a breathless exchange on hisway to a TV interview. &quot;We've had about six hours' sleep infive days.&quot;   It's not as if Michelangelo is the only virus out there.The Pakistani Brain, the Maltese Amoeba, the Kennedy Virusand about 2,000 other strains are all said to be coursingthrough the world's computers.   But Michelangelo has become the first celebrity virus. Onereason is its enormous element of suspense: a countdown todisaster culminating on the birthdate of its namesake. Itsthreat -- total data annihilation -- is unusually dire. AndMadison Avenue couldn't have given it a catchier name.   &quot;Suddenly it's like living in California waiting for theearthquake,&quot; says Jacob Slichter, a Minneapolis musician andwriter. He says local radio stations have been issuingregular Michelangelo warnings, and just yesterday a rumorcirculated that a nearby nuclear power plant caught the dreadvirus. &quot;Now people are fantasizing about South Minnesotagoing up in ashes because the plutonium is somehow wired intothe computer,&quot; he says.   Much about Michelangelo is still a mystery, including itsorigins. Computer viruses spread invisibly, programmed tocopy themselves from one disk to another. According to Mr.McAfee, a professor in Germany first spotted the Michelangeloprogram in early 1991. Virus-watchers think it may actuallyhave originated in the Netherlands, because of an earlycluster of sightings there.   Reports of a Michelangelo epidemic started circulating oncomputer bulletin boards a few months ago. &quot;This destructivevirus is spreading world-wide very rapidly,&quot; read one Januaryposting on a California board.   The whispers quickly turned into a roar, thanks in largepart to a media blitz by a hitherto obscure sub-segment ofthe software industry. Like evangelists thundering againstdoomsday, they sent a loud message that the way to computingsalvation lay in investing $80 or $100 in new anti-virussoftware.   The message worked wonders. Central Point Software Inc.,maker of the &quot;Michelangelo Protection Kit,&quot; recently hiredworkers for a new 12-hour shift so it could pump out productsround the clock. Sales have also been brisk at Peter Norton,where callers are greeted with a message urging them to buyits &quot;Michelangelo Limited Edition&quot; software. McAfeeAssociates, which distributes its anti-virus program viacomputer bulletin-board, says the board's 16 lines have beenbusy 24 hours a day.   Mr. McAfee has a team of virus-busters who walk around hisoffice wearing black gloves. His office wall has a lushpainting of a spaceship cruising through the universe zappingviruses. This week he has been going on television andwarning that 500,000 to 1.5 million computers are infectedwith Michelangelo -- an estimate some scoff at.   &quot;He's got a terrific product, but he has a tendency tohype things,&quot; says Charles Rutstein, author of the ExecutiveGuide to Computer Viruses, just out in a hastily issuedsecond printing.   It's no hype, says Mr. McAfee. Major high-tech companieslike Intel Corp. and Leading Edge have found viruses in theircomputers. Dataquest, a respected market-researcher, thisweek reported that 15% of companies it surveyed had at leastone outbreak of Michelangelo.   Israel Rittberg, president of a small Levittown, N.Y.,company that sells software to real-estate offices, workedround the clock Wednesday night removing the Michelangelovirus from a customer's computers. He caught two hours' sleepand then raced to another customer who also found the virus.&quot;These people are vandals,&quot; he says angrily.   Some virus-watchers were expecting damage as early asyesterday, since computers' built-in calendars may haveoverlooked leap year and declared March 6 a day early. Andindeed, Mr. McAfee said late yesterday that he'd heardreports that the virus had already destroyed data at morethan a dozen U.S. companies, but those reports were fuzzy andunconfirmed.   Even if Michelangelo turns out to be underwhelming, thatwon't necessarily put an end to virus fever. For one thing,the antivirus vendors can always take credit for safelyinoculating the nation's computers -- like the old joke aboutthe man who walks around with an &quot;elephant stick&quot; even thoughhe's miles away from any elephant. &quot;See, it works]&quot; heretorts.   And a few software companies are already pushing productsto eradicate the next looming threat to computer data: theFriday the 13th virus. That's a week from today.</TEXT></DOC>
