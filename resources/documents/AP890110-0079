The justices said Monday they will study a federal appeals courtruling that struck down key provisions of a Missouri law regulatingabortions.   The court's eventual decision, expected by July, could resolvethe Missouri controversy without disturbing the 1973 decision. ButMissouri officials and Justice Department lawyers are urging thejustices to use the case to overturn the landmakr Roe vs. Waderuling.   A reversal of that ruling would ``create political chaos andsocial upheaval across this country,'' Kate Michelman, executivedirector of the National Abortion Rights Action League, said on``CBS This Morning.''   ``There would be firestorms all across this country on thequestion of abortion,'' she said. ``... We will mobilize thiscountry the likes of which you have not seen in a long, long time.This country, women and men alike, will never accept going back tothe day when women have to risk their lives, their health, theirfamilies' lives in order to seek an abortion.''   William Bradford Reynolds, who as an assistant attorney generalpushed for a review of Roe vs. Wade, said on the CBS program that``there is certainly good reason for optimism that the court isgoing to differ with the lower court as far as some of thestrictions that have been placed in the Missouri statute onabortion.''   He added that he hopes ``it would go further and entertain thewhole question of Roe vs. Wade and reconsider it, and I would hopethat if it did that, it would come to a result that isconstitutionally sound and that we could correct the error that wasmade some years ago in this area,'' he said.   Reynolds maintained that the 1973 decision ``does not stand onvery firm constitutional footing.''   ``Women's lives are literally on the line'' if the court reversesits most famous abortion ruling, said Eleanor Smeal, president ofthe Fund for the Feminist Majority.   Molly Yard, president of the National Organization for Women,added: ``We are now declaring a state of emergency for the women ofAmerica.''   Yard, speculating on a ``worst-case scenario,'' said, ``Womenwill not accept an overturn. We will not go back to illegalabortions. It's going to be like Prohibition. We aren't going toobey the law.''   Judith Sewderowitz, executive director of the Center forPopulation Options, said her organization is ``deeply concerned thatthe court may be preparing to repeal the right to abortion.''   ``For adult women, retreat from the principles of Roe would be amajor setback,'' she said. ``For adolescents _ for whom too-earlychildbearing poses the threat of physical and emotional harm _retreat from Roe would be a disaster.''   Eve Paul of Planned Parenthood said, ``We can't predict what theSupreme Court will do but abortion has become a safe, legalprocedure which millions of women have had.''   Mark Chopko, a lawyer for the National Conference of CatholicBishops, said he was ``cautiously optimistic that today'sdevelopment signals the beginning of the court's reconsideration ofRoe vs. Wade.''   Samuel Lee of the anti-abortion Missouri Citizens for Life,called the case acted on Monday ``our best shot in a number of yearsto undo Roe, really our best shot since 1973 because of changes onthe court.''   The court is viewed as deeply divided on abortion.   Although Justices Harry A. Blackmun, William J. Brennan, ThurgoodMarshall and John Paul Stevens have resisted attempts to reverse orgreatly modify the 1973 decision, anti-abortion forces are hoping toattract five votes for such a result.   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Byron R. Whitedissented from the 1973 ruling and from several subsequent abortiondecisions.   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor in past decisions has questioned thecourt's reasoning in its 1973 decision.   Justice Antonin Scalia, who has not yet voted in an abortiondecision since being named to the high court by President Reagan in1986, is thought to favor overturning or curtailing Roe vs. Wade.   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who joined the court last Feb. 18,likewise has not voted in an abortion decision. His views onabortion and the Roe vs. Wade decision are not known in anysignificant detail.   ``We don't know what Kennedy is going to do,'' said the Missourianti-abortion group's Lee, ``but I'm more optimistic about him thanPlanned Parenthood is.''   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last July struck down,among other aspects of the Missouri abortion law, these fiveprovisions:   _A ban on using public hospitals and other facilities forabortions not necessary to save a woman's life.   _A ban prohibiting any public employee from performing orassisting in an abortion.   _A ban on using taxpayer money for ``encouraging or counseling''women to have abortions.   _A requirement that doctors determine whether a fetus believed tobe older than 19 weeks is capable of surviving outside the womb bytesting for weight and lung capacity.   _A declaration that ``the life of each human being begins atconception.''   Missouri Attorney General William L. Webster, in seeking SupremeCourt review, said the 1973 decision ``should itself bereconsidered'' if it cannot be squared with the disputed Missourilaw.   Reynolds, then chief of the Justice Department's civil rightsdivision, wrote to Missouri officials last summer urging them toinclude a challenge of Roe vs. Wade in the state's appeal.   And in a brief filed two days after the presidential electionNov. 8, Justice Department lawyers supported Missouri's appeal.   In its 1973 ruling, the Supreme Court said women have aconstitutional right to abortion, based on the right of privacy. Thecourt most recently reaffirmed that ruling in 1983, but the court'smembership has changed since then.   In other action, the court:   _Agreed to decide whether Congress may outlaw, as it tried to doin a 1988 law, all sexually explicit telephone dial-up messageservices, dubbed ``dial-a-porn.''   _Let stand, over two dissenting votes, a lower court ruling in anAlabama case that allows criminal defendants to exclude potentialjurors because of their race.   _Refused to let the federal government permit Japanese salmonfishermen off the Alaska coast to use huge nets in which porpoiseand other marine mammals become trapped.</TEXT></DOC>
