The information is contained in year-end filings with theCalifornia Insurance Department. Insurance units of FirstExecutive also reported sharply lower capital reserves andlarge cash outflows despite improved net income.</LP><TEXT>   Analysts said the detailed regulatory filings suggestcontinued bad news for the insurance units. &quot;The companiesappear to be under considerable financial pressure,&quot; saidFrederick Townsend, a partner in Townsend andamp; Schupp,Hartford-based insurance analysts.   Insurance operations depend on accumulated capital as anunderpinning for their obligations to policyholders.Investment losses, policy redemptions and underwritingpressures all can chip away at that financial foundation.   According to the First Executive filings, the combinedcapital reserves of its principal units tumbled 44% lastyear, to $739.7 million. Combined assets dwindled by 22%, to$13.34 billion.   Combined net income in these regulatory accounts was$128.7 million last year compared with a net loss of $6.6million a year earlier. But, on a cash basis, the operationsproduced a combined $2.87 billion outflow last year comparedwith a $350 million inflow in 1989.   As with all such regulatory filings, the First Executiveunits' year-end reports are based on statutory accounting,which differs somewhat from the generally accepted accountingprinciples of shareholder reports. Statutory accounting,among other things, treats the costs of writing new businessmore onerously.   First Executive's consolidated results for shareholdersare expected to be reported in a few weeks. In the meantime,details of the so-called statutory filings show some of theweaknesses of insurance portfolio valuations.   Junk-bond holdings in the two units rose to 79% of totalbond holdings at year-end compared with 55% at Dec. 31, 1989.Although the increase may reflect in part stiffer regulatorydefinitions of investment-grade securities, it also suggeststhat better-quality bonds were sold last year to meet atorrent of policy surrenders and redemptions.   The two units, Executive Life Insurance Co. and ExecutiveLife Insurance Co. of New York, overall reflect the strainsof a combined $3.97 billion in payouts for policyredemptions, more than double the 1989 payout, as well as$908.3 million in realized and unrealized investment losses,a 71% widening from 1989 losses.   A spokesman for First Executive said that most suchredemptions occurred early last year. William C. Adams,senior vice president, said the outflow has slowed since. Headded that the company may benefit by a recent upsurge injunk-bond markets, which he said have climbed 12% since Dec.31, the date of the statements. &quot;If the economy stabilizes,we will have recouped the losses,&quot; Mr. Adams said.   First Executive, once one of the nation's largest lifeinsurers, burgeoned in the 1980s on a combination ofaggressive new products and junk bond investments. ExecutiveLife Insurance, the larger of the parent company's mainunits, had $10.17 billion in assets at Dec. 31. ExecutiveLife Insurance Co. of New York, with $3.17 billion in assets,has had operations sharply curtailed by New York stateregulators for several years.   As with all insurers, the Executive Life companies valuebond holdings generally by their cost, together withadjustments. Despite hundreds of millions of dollars inwrite-downs, the approximate market value of the FirstExecutive units' bonds, was about $1.54 billion less at Dec.31 than the $9.25 billion at which the bonds were carried onthe books.   The ups and downs of the junk-bond market are important toFirst Executive and its units only when they must liquidatebonds from their portfolio. In all, First Executive's unitssold securities for a total of $4.96 billion, posting netlosses of only $91.5 million, including some attractive gainson a small common stock portfolio.   Now, analysts wonder whether First Executive's remainingbond portfolio will produce something close to the bookvalue. That, in turn, may depend on events beyond thecompany's control. &quot;The big question is whether the improvedeconomic outlook will benefit the company's holdings,&quot; saidDavid Lewis, an analyst at Robinson Humphrey Co. in Atlanta.   Separately, investor Thomas O. Hicks, chairman of theDallas investment firm, Hicks, Muse andamp; Co. reported the saleof 1.8 million shares of First Executive at prices between53.125 cents a share and 60 cents a share.   The transactions, reported to the Securities and ExchangeCommission reduced Mr. Hicks' stake in stock and warrants to7.34% of First Executive's stock outstanding from 9.52%. Mr.Hicks didn't give a reason for the sales.   Yesterday, in national over-the-counter trading, FirstExecutive common closed at 81.25 cents a share, up 9.375cents, on volume of 1.8 million shares.</TEXT></DOC>
