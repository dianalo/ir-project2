Rune Gunnar ``Roy'' Donnell, a Swedish butler who had beenjailed in lieu of $500,000 bail since his arrest last September,was freed Friday after a jury found him innocent of two counts ofgrand theft.   ``In other words, the butler didn't do it,'' said Donnell'sattorney, Donald C. Randolph.   Donnell, 62, had worked for Elizabeth Keck for 15 years, butquit about three months before she discovered a 19th-centuryEnglish painting missing from her Bel-Air home.   The impressionist work ``I Fria Luften,'' by Swedish-born artistAnders Zorn, was reported missing last September. A French work,``Fete Gallante,'' also was missing.   The paintings were sold to a Stockholm, Sweden, firm that paid$500,000 for ``I Fria Luften,'' and $5,000 for ``Fete Gallante.''   Donnell testified that he received permission to act as Mrs.Keck's agent in selling the paintings in Stockholm.   Mrs. Keck denied Donnell's story and told police Donnell oftenadmired the Zorn painting and said it would fetch a high price inSweden.   ``Suffice it to say that we feel that the jury was misled by thedefense,'' said Mrs. Keck's attorney, Steven Knowles. He said shewas considering filing a civil suit.   Mrs. Keck is a trustee of the Museum of Contemporary Art and herhusband, Howard B. Keck, is a retired oilman who has been listed byForbes Magazine as one the country's 400 richest people.</TEXT></DOC>
