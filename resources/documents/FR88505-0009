The EPA has promulgated this regulationon an interim-final basis in order to permit the more expeditious protectionof the public health and the environment, as directed by Congress for thisprovision of SARA.

Introduction</ITAG>The Deputy Assistant Administrator for Criminal Enforcement is authorizedto exercise his discretion in paying up to $10,000 for information leadingto the arrest and successful prosecution of any person for a criminal violationof CERCLA, as amended.The environmental and public health dangers associated with the illegaldisposal of hazardous materials have emerged as a matter of national interestand concern. In order to provide an incentive for individuals to come forwardwith information concerning such illegal practices, Congress has authorizedEPA to establish a program to reward citizens for providing informationuseful in prosecuting those involved in illegal hazardous waste activity.Because many informants are only available and reliable when they are givenappropriate and efficacious assurances that their identity will be protectedfrom disclosure, the security of assured confidentiality is necessary toprotect their employment status or some other legitimate privacy interests.The award provision provides both the security of confidentiality and theincentive of a cash award for an informant to come forward with pertinentinformation on the criminal violations of CERCLA.Both the initial determination of a claimant's eligibility for an awardand the subsequent determination of any amount to be awarded to a claimantare matters vested by statute in the exclusive discretion of the Agency.These determinations entail subjective considerations relating to the soundadministration of justice and to cooperation with EPA investigators andDepartment of Justice prosecutors. Providing information to the Agencyby any private citizen does not create any obligation to pay compensationfor such voluntary assistance. Law enforcement officials are not deemedto be ``private citizens'' as contemplated by this award program. Law enforcementofficial means any employee of the Federal government who takes part in,or is responsible for, the enforcement of Federal statutes and regulationsgoverning the handling of hazardous substances or wastes.Inasmuch as these decisions are made pursuant to the Deputy Assistant Administrator'sdiscretionary grant authority under CERCLA section 109(d), they constitutefinal administrative action on any properly filed award claim. This awardauthority is properly deemed to constitute the making of a discretionarypublic grant. Because this rule relates to public grants, benefits, orcontracts, it is exempt from all requirements of section 553 of the AdministrativeProcedures Act including notice and opportunity for comment and delayedeffective date.EPA believes the program will lead to increased enforcement activity withgreater deterrent impact. This incentive will also help the Agency attainits mandated goals of a cleaner environment and the earlier interventionof remedial resources, which will result in cost savings, enhanced publichealth protection and more expeditiously conducted cleanups. To expeditethis process, interim-final promulgation is both proper and appropriate.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Summary of Regulatory Analyses</ITAG>A. Executive Order No. 12291Proposed regulations must be classified as major or non-major to satisfythe rulemaking protocol established by Executive Order No. 12291. Accordingto Executive Order No. 12291, major rules are those that are likely toresult in:(1) An annual cost to the economy of $100 million or more; or(2) A major increase in costs or prices for consumers or individual industries,Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or(3) Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.This interim-final regulation provides an entirely voluntary procedureby which individuals who learn of potential criminal violations of theprovisions of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, andLiability Act (CERCLA), as amended, may disclose their information to EPAand apply for an award of up to $10,000. Because this interim-final rulemakingimposes no new burdens of any nature upon any regulated entity and createsno additional regulatory entities, and since the maximum award is limitedto $10,000, no formal Regulatory Impact Analysis is necessary. This interim-finalrule was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for itsreview as required by Executive Order No. 12291.B. Regulatory Flexibility ActThe Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires that a Regulatory FlexibilityAnalysis be performed for all rules that are likely to have ``significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' Because thisrulemaking applies only to individuals who choose to volunteer informationto the Agency regarding the criminal violations of CERCLA, it should haveno effect upon any other organizations, entities, or businesses, eitherlarge or small. Therefore, EPA certifies that this proposed regulationwill not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities.C. Paperwork Reduction ActThe Paperwork Reduction Act of 1986 requires approval from the Office ofManagement and Budget (OMB) for information requests. Because the Act exemptsfrom OMB clearance federal criminal matters or actions, and because thisinterim-final rulemaking is related to federal criminal enforcement underCERCLA, the Paperwork Reduction Act requirements do not apply.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 303</ITAG>Law enforcement, Intergovernmental relations, Superfund, Crime, Awards,National Response Center notification of release, Destruction of recordsrequired to be retained.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: April 28, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Lee M.
