(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An orchestra played Aaron Copland's``Fanfare for the Common Man'' Friday night as the 400-foot-highLouisville Falls Fountain, billed as the world's tallest floatingfountain, debuted before more than 60,000 people.   ``Paris has its Eiffel Tower. London has Big Ben. Rome has theColiseum. And tonight the world-class city of Louisville has theLouisville Falls Fountain,'' said Mary Ray Oaken, secretary of thestate Tourism Cabinet.   The crowd lined the banks of the Ohio River as the fountain wastriggered.   It took 20 minutes for the computer-controlled fountain's 41jets and red, white, blue and amber lights to complete its programof patterns, which concludes when the fountain sprays afleur-de-lis _ Louisville's official symbol _ about 400 feet abovethe river.   The fountain, on an octagonal barge 39 feet across, is a gift tothe city from Mary and Barry Bingham Sr., who donated $2.6 millionfor its construction and maintenance for three years. Bingham,patriarch of a three-generation media family, died Monday at age 82.   ``I know that he (Barry Bingham Sr.) is with us tonight in aspirit of joy and fulfillment,'' Barry Bingham Jr. said.   Gov. Wallace Wilkinson said he would never see the fountainwithout thinking of the elder Bingham and that the fountain wouldflow ``as an eternal flame would burn in his memory.''   Plenty of entertainment was on hand, including dancers, singers,an orchestra and bands _ the 100th Army Reserve Band, country musicand rock 'n' roll.   A flotilla of at least 100 boats gathered near the George RogersClark Memorial Bridge, which was closed to vehicular traffic andwas packed with 8,000 to 10,000 people.   Interstate 64, which skirts the Ohio River at Louisville wasjammed as motorists stopped to watch the fountain dedication,creating a massive traffic tieup.   ``I think the whole city is planning a party,'' said JohnRichards, executive director of the Mary and Barry Bingham Sr. Fund.   Electrical engineer Frank Gavuld, who was aboard the barge, saidafterward: ``It ran perfectly. We've had it up to 429 feet, but the420 feet tonight was right on target.''   ``I thought it was excellent,'' said Greg Schum of Louisville,who staked out his spot six hours before the fountain was turnedon. ``It's like fireworks made out of water. It's something thecity can be proud of.''   The fountain, proposed almost 30 years ago, was built by PeteSerodino of Chattanooga, Tenn., a marine contractor who has builtother floating fountains around the world. This one sprays thehighest, backers said.   Plans call for the fountain to operate primarily in theafternoons and evenings from early spring to early fall.   When operating fully, it will spout 15,800 gallons of water aminute, more than the average Louisville household consumes in twomonths.   The fountain is one of five of its kind in the world, accordingto the Louisville Central Area, an agency promoting the city.   Skip Nelson, a member of the development team of InternationalFountain Developers in Cincinnati, said the second-largest suchfountain is in Fountain Hills, Ariz. That fountain was rated to runat more than 500 feet but is actually run at less than 400 feet, hesaid. Each of the other four fountains, Nelson said, is a singlejet going straight up into the air.   But a spokesman for the company that operates the Arizonafountain says the Louisville fountain's 400-foot advertised heightdoesn't come close to theirs.   The Arizona fountain, first turned on Dec. 15, 1970, is rated at560 feet, which MCO Properties Inc. spokesman Keith McMahan McMahansays it reaches any time there's no wind.</TEXT></DOC>
