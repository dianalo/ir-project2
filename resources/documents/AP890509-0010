Zobel.   It is this layer, or rhizosphere, that determines what kind ofcrops can be grown, if any, and where so many of the Earth's peoplecan live well.   Zobel, a plant geneticist, said Monday that the rhizosphere is ateeming world of minerals, gases, water and life forms _ insects,earthworms, microscopic nematode worms, a host of microorganisms,living and dead plant roots, and the chemicals they exude.   ``We don't even begin to thoroughly understand it, althoughwe're slowly pulling it together,'' he said. ``I'd say ourknowledge of the area six inches to two feet below the soil'ssurface is comparable to our knowledge of outer space right now.''   Zobel works for the department's Agricultural Research Serviceat its Ithaca, N.Y., laboratory.   One reason for lack of knowledge about the world at our feet isthat ``only recently have we had the tools to study it, and they'restill not up to the job,'' he said. ``Soil physics and chemistry,plant biology and physiology, entomology and microbiology allprovide tools, but none of them is designed to work with more thana single microorganism or a single plant at a time.''   And when a scientist has to ``put all these elements togetherand try to study them, it's tough,'' Zobel said. ``We need to learnhow microorganisms interact with the plant, and with each other.Plant roots aren't all the same; they're functionally different andhave different growth patterns. Some die back every two weeks,continually feeding the microorganisms in the soil.''   Zobel spoke Monday at an annual symposium held by the agency atBeltsville, Md. His remarks were included in reports issued by thedepartment.   Topics in the four-day conference include genetic engineeringand some of the new technologies for investigating the Earth's rootzone.   One of scientists' goals is to find ways to grow crops wherethey won't grow now because the soil is too wet, dry or salty, orhas trace elements such as aluminum that can inhibit growth.   ``But we don't have the genetic information to manipulate theplants the way we need to do,'' Zobel said. ``A lot of thatinformation is below the surface of the soil. I think we're on theedge of a major revolution here, and can begin to get handles onthese things.''   Zobel said when scientists gain understanding of therhizosphere, ``a whole multitude of things'' will fall into place.   ``For example, we could reduce chemical use on crops by knowingwhat biological elements in the soil will do the same thing,'' hesaid. ``That affects groundwater quality since you reduce thechances of chemicals moving into the water.''   And if scientists could increase the ability of microorganismsto take nitrogen from the atmosphere and turn it into forms thatplants can use, it could mean a major reduction in fertilizer use.   ``We're only beginning to understand that a plant has genes thatcontrol nitrogen fixation as well as the bacteria do, so we canmanipulate the plant end, too,'' Zobel said. ``That's an awful lotof information still to be discovered.''</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter hasnamed on-campus representatives to represent the AgricultureDepartment at 17 historically black universities.   The plan first announced in December will create a USDA liaisonoffice at each of the schools, which are collectively known as 1890institutions because of new land-grant college legislation thatyear.   Yeutter said Monday the top priority for the USDArepresentatives, all currently employed by the department in othercapacities, will be to work with state and local departmentofficials in an outreach effort to recruit minorities intoagricultural and forestry studies at the schools.   The campus officials also will provide guidance and teachingassistance, help develop curriculums, and recruit and counselstudents on USDA job opportunities and other agricultural careers,he said. They also will provide some assistance to small farmers.   More than 400 USDA employees applied for the 17 positions,Yeutter said. All of the new representatives are scheduled to be onthe job by mid-June.
