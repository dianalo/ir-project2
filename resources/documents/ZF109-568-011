 Thetrial is set to run for two years and will eventually test two types of fibreoptic system using 300 homes and businesses in the local loop at Bishop'sStortford.andP;  Customers receiving the broadband system will be able to accessterrestrial, satellite and cable television programmes, viewdata servicessuch as Prestel and videoconferencing facilities.andM;Video jukeboxandM;Future applications could include a video jukebox where customers pull downvideos from a remote database, as well as videophones, interactive televisionservices and high-definition television.andP;  Applications in a full scale systemwould depend on which fibre optic system British Telecom decides toimplement.andP;  This in turn is dependent on whether BT is granted a permanentlicence to carry television - the present one is for the purposes of thetrial only.andP;  Without the television licence, for cable and satellitetelevision entertainment services, Telecom reckons that it would not get thelevel of subscription needed to fund the implementation of a countrywidebroadband fibre optic system.andP;  At least not in the forseeable future.andP;  But ifthe licence is granted, it means trouble for the start-up cable televisioncompanies - at least one of which provides local loop telephony thatundercuts Telecom prices.andP;  A spokesman for the Cable Television Association,representing the 135 broadband operators in Britain, said &quot;the effect wouldbe very serious.andP;  It would discourage investment and...finish off theindustry&quot;.andP;  Telecom reckons that fibre-to-kerb systems which do not carrybroadband services, but which can fairly easily be upgraded to do so, willeventually be implemented throughout Britain.andP;  Project manager GranvilleTaylor, said, &quot;the costs of fibre systems are decreasing and the returns on afibre are better in terms of managing the network, so fibre is a viablemedium for telephony alone and is the aim of a global telecommunicationscompany&quot;.andP;  But he added that the roll-out of fibre, especially systems thatcould carry broadband services would be greatly accelerated by revenues fromtelevision entertainment services.andP;  The estimated cost of installing acompletely fibre system runs in to billions of pounds.andP;  Simply to implementthe trial, Telecom placed contracts worth #4.5m with its partners - whollyowned subsidiary, Fulcrum Communications Ltd, BICC Cables and GEC PlessyTelecommunications.-andM;The decision as to whether to grant British Telecom a licence to carrytelevision serv ices is proving highly contentious.andP;  British Telecom saysthat without such a licence it cannot afford to introduce a nationalbroadband fibre optic service.andP;  But cable TV companies argue that grantingBritish Telecom such a licence is tantamount to signing their death warrants.andO;The problem is that while everybody agrees that fibre optic net works are thefuture for communications they are expensive to imple ment and lucrative television licences offer a way to recoup the investment.andP;  Sonya McGilchriststarted her investigations at Bishop's Stortford.andP;  -Unlike some Telecomofficials and other commentators, Jack Dawson of GEC Plessey does not believethat television will &quot;make or break&quot; the deployment of broadband fibre.andO;Dawson reckons that &quot;there will be interactive broadband services towards theend of the century which will be telecommunications based&quot; - presumablybusiness and educational services.andP;  And he says that this should be incentiveenough for Telecom to set up a broadband network.andP;  In Bishop's Stortford,Telecom is testing TPON, and BIDS.andP;  TPON stands for Telephony on PassiveOptical Networks and comes in two versions, TPON direct to the home orbusiness and TPON to the street - otherwise known as fibre-to-kerb.andO;Fibre-to-kerb systems are currently being tested at various sites, includingLynfield, Massachusetts, by Raynet and Nynex, and by Deutsche BundespostTelekom in Cologne.andP;  TPON takes the fibre system to a kerb-side cabinet butcompletes the final link to the home over copper - therefore no broadbandservices can be supplied.andP;  However, broadband services could be superimposedon a TPON network fairly easily, using lasers of different wavelengths.andP;  TPONthen becomes BPON, which stands for Broadband Passive Optical Network.andP;  Thissystem is not being tested by Telecom.andP;  The advantage of TPON is that theoptoelectronic components, which are the expensive bits in a fibre system,can be housed in a street cabinet that serves 15 houses.andP;  The cost of theelectronics is therefore shared.andP;  TPON direct to homes and businesses canalso carry broadband, but requires an overhead cable dropped to the buildingfrom a telegraph pole.andM;Duopoly ReviewandM;The component costs are therefore not shared between the users.andP;  The othersystem being tested, BIDS, is an active network based on electronic switches.andO;It stands for Broadband Integrated Distributed Star and incorporates the sametechnology used by the British Telecom-designed Westminster Cable TV network.andO;Switching is carried out at streetside access points, so that each customerreceives only the broadband channels requested.andP;  Telephony is carried onseparate fibres from the exchange to the access points where they arecombined for transmission over one fibre to each customer.andP;  The system istherefore not as economic as TPON.andP;  Telecom says it is keeping an open mindon which system, if any, is implemented, but a national system will owe asmuch to the position of cable television companies after the duopoly review,as the results of the trial, which is not due to end until 1992.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
