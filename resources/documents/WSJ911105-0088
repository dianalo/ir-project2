An EC spokesman said, however, that the commission iswaiting for Airbus to supply more information on its chargesbefore deciding whether to begin a formal procedure againstBritish Airways.</LP><TEXT>   An Airbus spokesman said the consortium would provide theEC with more detailed information within about one week.Airbus is composed of British Aerospace PLC, Deutsche Airbusof Germany, Aerospatiale of France and ConstruccionesAeronauticas S.A. of Spain.   A British Airways spokesman said the allegations &quot;arewrong and will be repudiated.&quot;   A GE spokesman declined to comment on the allegations oron any negotiations between it and its customers. Boeing alsowouldn't comment on the allegations.   Airbus's initial letter was sent, along with a 30-pagememorandum, in mid-September to Sir Leon Brittan, ECcompetition chief, by Jean Pierson, Airbus chief executive.The letter alleges that British Airways conspired with Boeingand GE to freeze Airbus out of large British Airways aircraftorders, in particular the decision in August to buy Boeing777s instead of Airbus A-340s.   Commission sources said that if Airbus proves itsallegations have merit, the EC will launch an investigation.   &quot;In principle, people are free to buy whatever they want,&quot;one official said. &quot;But if there is a cartel operating thenwe would look into it.&quot;   An Airbus spokesman said Mr. Pierson alleged that BritishAirways had systematically favored Boeing and GE in its largeaircraft orders. Moreover, Mr. Pierson alleged, BritishAirways pressured GE into withholding discounts for aircraftengines offered with Airbus planes though it offered thediscounts for similar Boeing orders.   In return, British Airways is alleged to have receivedinflated discounts from Boeing and GE. (GE isn't related tothe British concern of the same name.)   Airbus also charged that GE paid British Airways three tofour times the market rate to buy an engine-overhaul unit atCardiff, Wales. Airbus believes the high price paid for theCardiff facilities -- #272 million ($480.3 million) -- was aform of rebate to British Airways from GE.</TEXT></DOC>
