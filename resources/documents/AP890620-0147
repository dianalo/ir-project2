Intensifying his drive for upgrading U.S. strategic forces, Bushtold congressional leaders ``don't pull the rug out from under us''on the two-missile plan, according to presidential press secretaryMarlin Fitzwater.   Bush's willingness to abandon the mobile-missile ban at thenegotiating table in Geneva could enhance chances for congressionalpassage of his missile-building package, claimed Senate ArmedServices Committee Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga.   Nunn, who had criticized Bush for failing to make a strong-enoughcase for his two-missile program, said he came away from a WhiteHouse meeting ``very encouraged'' about the future of both missiles.   Bush's comments, relayed by participants at the meeting as wellas by Fitzwater, signal a key modification of position for the WhiteHouse in strategic arms reduction talks, known as START, thatresumed on Monday in Geneva after a seven-month hiatus.   ``We would be prepared to adjust our position on the banaccordingly'' if Congress gives the go-ahead to both the MX andMidgetman proposals, Fitzwater said.   However, he said in the absence of such congressional approval,the U.S. position favoring a ban on mobile long-range nuclearweapons would remain on the table.   On Capitol Hill, meanwhile, Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., complainedto Secretary of State James A. Baker III about the emphasis the Bushadministration was giving to the issue of verification.   U.S. negotiators in Geneva are under instruction to try to workout some arrangements to insure compliance with an eventual treaty.   Biden told Baker the administration ``is risking a major blunderwith no potential gain.'' The senator said concentrating onanti-cheating safeguards could divert attention from such majorissues as reducing weapons arsenals.   The result, Biden said, could be indefinitely postponingcompletion of an accord.   Baker assured Biden there was no ``ulterior motive'' in trying topin down verification measures. In fact, he said, one purpose was toaccelerate Senate ratification of the treaty by discussingenforcement with the Soviets in advance.   The proposal to ban all mobile nuclear missile systems was madeby the Reagan administration and embraced until Tuesday by the Bushadministration. It would apply to both the 10-warhead MX missile andthe one-warhead Midgetman _ as well as to their Soviet counterparts,including the multiple-warhead SS-24s.   However, the administration found itself in the position ofadvocating such a ban in Geneva while arguing on Capitol Hill formore mobile-missile deployment.   Bush in April proposed spending $1.2 billon next year to beginplacing 50 existing MX missiles on rail cars; and another $100million as a first installment on a $25 billion program to build thetruck-based Midgetman by 1997.   However, the plan has run into considerable opposition inCongress _ both among those who contend the twin-missile program istoo expensive and among those who favor one weapon or the other.   Fitzwater said: ``We think a mobile capability is essential. Thenyou negotiate reductions as best you can.''   He said that moving ahead on both the MX and Midgetman missileswould give the United States more leverage at the Geneva talks.   He compared pressing ahead with the two mobile missile systems _against the backdrop of the talks to reduce strategic weapons _ withthe U.S. decision to go ahead with deployment of intermediate-rangecruise missiles during negotiations that led to the 1987 U.S.-Soviettreaty to ban such weapons.   ``If Congress does pass those (MX and Midgetman), then they wouldbecome part of our negotiations (in Geneva),'' Fitzwater said.   Nunn said he was satisfied by the outcome of the White Housesession.   ``I think it's very clear that the president, the secretary ofstate and the secretary of defense were willing and indeed indicatedthey would re-examine the Geneva position on banning mobile missilesif Congress approves both the MX rail-mobile and the Midgetmanfunding,'' he said.   ``They made it clear, however, that they were not going to end upin a position permiting mobile missiles if Congress was not going tofund mobile missiles,'' Nunn added.   Nunn also said he strongly supported the administration'sproposal that efforts to reach agreement on verification proceduresbe nailed down between U.S. and Soviet negotiators at the outset oftalks on controlling long-range missiles.   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., senior Republican on the Armed ServicesCommittee, lauded the president's position.   Warner said Bush ``clearly told us that if the Congress can getits act together and support the president on both programs, thenthe question of mobility would be revisited by the administration.''   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., told reporters ``itremains to be seen'' whether Bush's strong pitch for his two-missileplan would help it overcome opposition in Congress.</TEXT></DOC>
