Revenues rose 14% to #1.24 billion ($2.22 billion) from #1.09 billion. Profit after taxes rose to #45 million from #36 million. Profit would have been higher if it hadn't been for the fall in precious metal prices and the dollar, the company said. Johnson Matthey also was able to greatly reduce its debt during the year, the company said.    OY NOKIA, Finland's biggest private industrial group, posted an 11% increase in pretax profit on a surge in sales in the first four months of 1988. The electronics, paper, rubber and cables manufacturer said its pretax profit for the period rose to 312 million Finnish markkas ($75.3 million) from 282 million markkas a year earlier. Group sales rose 68% to 6.83 billion markkas ($1.65 billion) from 4.07 billion markkas. Much of the increase in sales stemmed from Nokia's 1.35 billion Swedish kronor purchase early in the year of the information-systems division of Sweden's Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson.    QWINZY CO., a Hong Kong money broker, and partners are negotiating the purchase of a controlling stake in the financial-services group Mercantile House Holdings from BRITISH andamp; COMMONWEALTH HOLDINGS PLC. Qwinzy and a group of unidentified non-bank financial-services companies plan to form a new company that would acquire a 56% stake in Mercantile House Holdings for #250 million ($446.5 million). </TEXT></DOC>
