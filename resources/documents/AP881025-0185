Said Dukakis, ``We're just working hardand we're going to win.''   The two rivals clashed in commericals and campaign rhetoric asfresh nationwide surveys rated Bush the double-digit leader twoweeks before Election Day.   The vice president said in Ohio that Dukakis was an advocate foreconomic policies ``far outside the mainstream,'' policies thatresemble European socialism more than American free enterprise. Andhis aides previewed a television commercial accusing the Democraticpresidential candidate of deliberately misleading voters about hisrecord as governor.   Dukakis renewed his own complaints about Republican ads as hecampaigned on the ground in California and on television throughcommercials and a 90-minute appearance on ABC's ``Nightline.''   ``Now they've got a tank ad _ has all kinds of misstatements andoutright falsehoods,'' Dukakis said. ``We Democrats are for a strongdefense.''   Democratic running mate Lloyd Bentsen added his voice. He saidthat in their ads, Republicans accuse Dukakis of opposing theStealth bomber and the Pershing II missile. ``And that's a lie andthey know it,'' he said.   A survey by CBS and the New York Times gave Bush a 54-41 leadamong probable voters. The Gallup Organization had the race at 53-39among likely voters in calls made Friday through Sunday. Bothsurveys had margins of potential sampling error of plus or minusthree percentage points.   The surveys indicated Bush has solidified his advantage in thetwo weeks since the last presidential debate.   But even before the surveys were released, Dukakis aides werebusy trying to cast doubt on the results. These aides, speaking oncondition they not be identified, said internal campaign pollingshowed a six-point lead for the Republican ticket, down from 10points last week. They said Dukakis' recent Populist-style rhetoricand allegations of Republican campaign lies were scoring points.   Spokesman Dayton Duncan added, ``Our polling shows by anoverwhelming margin people are blaming Bush for this negativecampaign.''   The campaign air war was relentless.   Bush's aides previewed a commercial saying Dukakis ``deliberatelymisled'' debate viewers when he denied that he'd taken money fromthe Massachusetts pension fund to help balance the state budget.   ``And Michael Dukakis says George Bush is running a campaign oflies?'' a narrator asks. ``Michael Dukakis is unbelievable.''   Dukakis countered with a series of four commercials showinghimself and Bentsen and asking viewers to imagine a better America.``As president, Michael Dukakis will be on your side,'' says thenarrator.   Bush dispatched surrogates to rebut Democratic charges of unfaircampaign tactics.   Among them was vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle, who saiddesperate Democrats were dishing out ``political sludge'' withDukakis' active encouragement. He branded the entire operation``despicable'' and said Bush was a man of ``unshakable integrity andfairness.''   Bush sought personally to deflect Democratic charges that hestood for the wealthy at the expense of the less well off.   ``We will move forward not by succumbing to the base temptationsof division, fear and envy, but by following, as Abraham Lincolnsaid, those better angels of our nature,'' he told a breakfast inColumbus.   Bush said Dukakis had been making ``increasing appeals to classconflict,'' and said that in his view there was ``no place inAmerican life for philosophies that divide Americans one fromanother along class lines and that excite conflict among them.''   The vice president charged his Democratic rival was ``far outsidethe mainstream of economic thinking and he's broken with theAmerican tradition of entrepreneurship and free enterprise.''   The GOP nominee said Dukakis favors an industrial policy ofcontrol that has been tried and rejected as unsuccessful in Europe.``Around the world, governments are abandoning socialism, movingaway from socialistic, high control experience ... and embracing theAmerican model of low taxation, entrepreneurship and individualintitative.''   Craig Fuller, Bush's chief of staff, asked if the vice presidentwas calling Dukakis a socialist, said, ``That would be going toofar.''   Campaign surrogates were making their customary rounds.   Senate GOP Leader Bob Dole was in Pennsylvania, predicting aRepublican victory and taunting Dukakis that he deserved a ``Rip VanWinkle'' award. ``He just sort of went to sleep there for about sixor eight weeks and when he woke up the election was over,'' saidDole, who lost out to Bush in the springtime race for the GOPpresidential nomination.   Democratic Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas agreed that Dukakis madea mistake by failing to respond to Bush's attacks for weeks at atime. He disagreed with Dole that the race was over, praised theDemocrat's latest round of television commercials and said, ``Iwould have done it eight weeks ago.''   Dukakis began airing a series of television commercials lastweekend that charged the Bush campaign with distortions and lies.   His campaign also purchased time for a five-minute paidadvertisement on NBC late Tuesday night that duplicated a commercialaired Saturday night on ABC. In it, Dukakis accused Bush of runninga campaign of ``fear and of smear'' and pledged to fight for MainStreet Americans.</TEXT></DOC>
