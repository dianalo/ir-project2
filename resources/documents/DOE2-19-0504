The window is shown to dramatically improve the spatialmode properties, stabilizing and smoothing the near field, and reducingthe far field from 5{sup 0}--15{sup 0} to as low as 2{sup 0}. This improvementcomes at the expense of an increase in threshold current and reductionof quantum efficiency.</TEXT></DOC>
