The agreement, reached early yesterday after a 41-hourweekend bargaining session, requires GM to boost the amountof money it pays to employees who get laid off. UAW retireeswill get fatter pensions. Active workers will get 3% higherbase pay this year, and lump-sum payments in the next twoyears.</LP><TEXT>   The pact places new restrictions on GM's ability to closeplants. But the agreement apparently doesn't require the automaker to find work for some 30,000 UAW-GM employees who losttheir jobs as the giant auto maker shrunk its U.S. operationsduring the past three years. And the improved pensionbenefits could encourage some of the roughly 20,000 workerseligible to retire now to do so.   &quot;They're buying the right to downsize,&quot; said Scott Merlis,an analyst with Morgan Stanley and Co.   And while the estimated $4 billion cost of the job andincome security improvements looks high in absolute terms,it's a relatively modest amount compared with GM's $126.9billion in annual revenue. The auto giant spent more-about $5billionjust for last year's retail car and truck salesincentives in North America.   Top UAW officials declined to disclose details of the pactyesterday, but said they are pleased with the agreement.   &quot;I've been smiling broadly since about 3:30 this morning,&quot;UAW President Owen Bieber said yesterday. Members, he said,&quot;will be pleased with what they see&quot; when the details arepresented at a meeting scheduled for this morning in Detroit.The meeting is the first step in what could be a two-weekeffort by the union's leadership to win ratification of thecontract by the rank and file.   Company officials said they, too, were satisfied. &quot;Wefashioned an agreement that will serve GM well, and will giveour employees more security,&quot; said Alfred S. Warren, GM'svice president for labor relations. It isn't clear, however,whether the pact will allow GM to make significant gains inproductivity to help its marginally profitable U.S. autooperations better compete.   According to sources in the UAW and the company, theagreement includes these features:   -- A 3% base wage increase for this year, and lump-sumpayments equal to 3% of employees' base wages in each of thetwo following years. UAW members who are skilled tradesmen,such as electricians and tool-and-die makers, will receive anadditional increase of 30 cents per hour.   -- Increased supplemental unemployment benefits. Laid-offGM workers with more than 10 years seniority could get up to95% of their base pay for a maximum of three years instead ofthe current two, local UAW officials said. Laid-off workerswith less than 10 years seniority could get 95% pay for afull year, up from six months or less now.   -- A boost in pension income to about $1,800 a month, up12.5% from about $1,600 a month now. The pact also includesan increase of about $630 in annual pension income forcurrent retirees.   -- A limitation on the number of weeks that GM maytemporarily idle plants. How the limitation would work isn'tclear.   -- A promise by GM to give the union a greater say indecisions to move work out of GM plants tonon-UAW-represented operations.   -- GM gets the union's blessing to seek three-shiftproduction, instead of the standard two shifts, at U.S.factories. Three shift operations at GM plants in Europe havehelped to produce record profits, although it isn't clearthat GM could sell enough cars in the U.S. to warrant threeshifts at its American factories. GM also gets a newabsenteeism policy that company officials say will make iteasier to crack down on chronic work-skippers.   The agreement may help GM improve its relationship withthe union, which has been strained over the past three years,often over the issue of job security. The new leadership atGM and the UAW may have helped.   The contract was the first major test of new GM ChairmanRobert C. Stempel and so far, Mr. Stempel seems to haveemerged a winner. GM officials said they are encouraged bythe spirit of cooperation that grew during the talks. Thatwas symbolized by the union's decision not to call a strikeafter the old contract expired Friday night. Instead, theunion extended its old pact on a day-to-day basis andbargained around the clock to reach agreement at about 2 a.m.Monday.   Under Mr. Stempel, GM's negotiating team gave plant andmanufacturing group executives a greater role in thebargaining process than in prior years. Mr. Stempel held animportant meeting with top UAW bargainers last week whichhelped to move talks forward after they bogged down.   These talks also were a test for Stephen P. Yokich, theunion's vice president of its GM department. Mr. Yokich,whose reputation for striking companies had worried GMofficials, impressed GM executives with his &quot;businesslike&quot;approach. Sources close to the talks say these negotiationslacked the acrimony and emotional displays of prior talks.   GM's stock closed at $37.125, down 37.5 cents, yesterdayin composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.   UAW leaders are expected to approve the new accord aftertoday's meeting, but they will have to convince 310,000active and laid-off UAW members to approve the contract.   Because the negotiations dragged on until early Monday,UAW leaders said they didn't have time to prepare documentsexplaining the tentative agreement. Local leaders were toldto wait until this morning for full details of the pact. Theysaid yesterday that they were able to get only sketchyoutlines of the proposed contract.   &quot;It seems like it's okay,&quot; said Keith Campbell, presidentof UAW Local 1999 in Oklahoma City, Okla. &quot;I don't think it'sa bad agreement,&quot; he said. &quot;I don't think it's a greatagreement.&quot;   Following ratification, the union will press Ford MotorCo. and Chrysler Corp. to accept nearly identical terms. Mr.Bieber declined to say which company the union will targetnext, but it's widely expected that it will be Ford.   Chrysler officials have insisted they can't afford tomatch an agreement tailored to GM and Ford, both of whichhave extensive, and highly profitable, operations in Europeand overseas. &quot;Chrysler doesn't have Europe to subsidize thiscontract,&quot; said Mr. Merlis, the Morgan Stanley analyst.   &quot;We have our own set of concerns,&quot; R. S. Miller Jr.,Chrysler's vice chairman, said last Friday. &quot;We hope theunion will be responsive to them. There is no pattern today.Going into the future, that has to be recognized.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
