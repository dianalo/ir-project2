The agreement is the latest sign that some of the world'smajor aircraft makers are forming tentative teams to go afterwhat could become the most lucrative jet-building projectever. Aerospatiale of France and British Aerospace PLCannounced a similar agreement in May.</LP><TEXT>   Boeing said its work with Deutsche Airbus, a unit ofDeutsche Aerospace, &quot;will be directed at market, financialand technical elements&quot; of a high-speed transport. &quot;We wantto identify what we might do together; we don't have anyagreements to actually build airplanes,&quot; a Boeing spokesmansaid.   The companies have been pursuing independent assessmentsof a new plane, which would fly at about 1,600 miles an hour,have a range of roughly 5,000 miles and carry 350 passengers.The Concorde, the only existing supersonic passenger jet,flies at about 1,400 miles an hour, has a range of up to3,500 miles and carries only 100 people, Boeing said. Asecond-generation plane would also have to make supersonictravel more affordable.   The companies are members of a loose alliance studying thefeasibility of a new high-speed plane. The other participantsare British Aerospace, Aerospatiale and St. Louis-basedMcDonnell Douglas Corp. The companies have said they don'texpect any project to be completed before 2005.   Separately, Boeing said it signed a memorandum ofagreement with Paris-based Thomson-CSF, a unit of ThomsonS.A., to jointly compete for new business in the globaldefense and aerospace marketplace. Boeing said the companiesdon't currently have any business together.</TEXT></DOC>
