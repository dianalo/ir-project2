As the country muddles through, it is becoming apparent that the economic deterioration isn't threatening the rule of strongman Gen. Manuel A. Noriega. However, it probably will ruin much of the middle class, which has been his most vociferous opposition.    Most Panamanians are making do. Take Adolfo Berrios, the president of an electrical contracting company. Since the crisis began, Mr. Berrios has been paid -- and has canceled debts -- with products ranging from chickens and eggs to bicycles. He says 80% of his business is based on barter deals, and jokes that instead of a central bank, Panama should open a central barter office.    As payment on one contract, Mr. Berrios received $4,000 worth of live chickens, some of which he exchanged for certificates redeemable for groceries at a supermarket. Mr. Berrios, who has laid off 35 of his 47 workers, pays one-quarter of their salary with these grocery bonds.    When a cement producer gave him about 500 bicycles valued at about $80,000 to cancel a debt, Mr. Berrios became a bicycle salesman. He dedicates one day a week to exchanging bicycles, chickens, eggs and anything else he has received as payment for cash, debts, or the materials he needs to work with. &quot;Bicycles are easy,&quot; he says. &quot;It's the eggs and chickens that are difficult.&quot; Mr. Berrios thinks he can keep going this way for six or seven months, but if things don't improve he will move his family to Costa Rica, where he has already set up a company.    Other bartered items include tax credits. Alberto Aleman, the head of the construction industry trade group, says his company has traded these for cement.    Meanwhile, Panama's 150,000 government workers are paid in multiple smalldenomination checks for easier use. These checks can be used to pay taxes and utility bills, and are widely traded. One banker says they have become a parallel currency, alongside the U.S. dollar, which is the unit used in Panama. He calls the checks &quot;Pana-dollars.&quot;    In Panama's once bustling financial markets, the only action is in the barter or sale of time deposits and savings accounts. These are sold at a 10%-to-15% discount by Panamanians eager to get their money out of the country to buyers who use them to pay off bank debts.    Things will probably get stranger. One specter that troubles many executives is worker takeovers of failing businesses. Panamanian labor law stipulates that laidoff workers receive several weeks salary, varying by length of service, for every year they have worked. If the company can't make the payments, workers have the right to take it over. So far this year, there have been 58% secuestros, as they are called in Panama, up from 38 all of last year, according to the Labor Ministry.    &quot;It could happen,&quot; says Juan Ramon Feliu, vice president of the Panama Industrial Association, Panama's leading industry group. &quot;Things could get desperate, and desperation is a bad counselor.&quot;    At Maderas Laminadas S.A., a plywood manufacturer, things already are desperate. In the yard, huge hardwood logs lie mired in mud next to a disabled truck. But the company is limping along, under the orders of an administrator agreed to by the workers.    &quot;Secuestros are the workers' weapon,&quot; says Natividad Rodriguez, a union steward who engineered the company takeover. &quot;If a company says it is closing and it has no money to pay, then we have a fight on.&quot;    Panama has been stewing in an economic and political funk since February, when the then president tried to fire Gen. Noriega and was himself fired. A few days later, Washington froze Panamanian assets in the U.S., triggering a run on Panama's banks that forced a nine-week bank closure. Since then, Gen. Noriega has survived huge protests and a coup attempt.    Although barter and a trickle of dollars enable the economy to soldier on, government and opposition agree there is little chance to reverse its decline. Given Panama's peaceful history, the absence of a united, popular opposition leadership, and Gen. Noriega's willingness to quash his opposition through intimidation and armed repression, few see any possibility for change. The prospects are that Gen. Noriega will continue his destructive stewardship over an increasingly impoverished country for the foreseeable future.    &quot;It's the worst possible situation,&quot; says a former Panamanian cabinet minister. &quot;The government can't administer and the opposition can't topple.&quot;    Stiffling a yawn, Commerce Minister Mario Rognoni says Panama's gross national product will fall 30% this year. &quot;From a U.S.-like standard of living, we will fall to the level of a Honduras or a Belize -- perhaps even Haiti -- before we hit bottom,&quot; he says.    A remarkably nonchalant Mr. Rognoni sees the crisis as an opportunity to build a service-oriented economy on the ashes of Panama's overprotected industries. Panama, he says, could be one huge free-trade zone, using a basket of currencies to free it from its dependence on the dollar.    Panama City is still a long way from turning into Port-au-Prince, but signs of economic deterioration are everywhere. Cranes stand idle over half-built high-rises. More and more offices sport for-rent or for-sale signs. Retail sales are off 40% and along the Avenida Central, the normally jammed shopping district, a dwindling number of customers all but ignore signs everywhere that proclaim bargains at &quot;crisis prices.&quot;    Many companies have slashed payroll costs by reducing wages or laying off workers, or both. The government conservatively estimates unemployment has doubled to about 20%, a figure that is bound to go much higher as companies use up inventories and lay off more people. The full impact hasn't been felt because most companies pay generous severance.    Most workers -- 70% of the private-sector work force by the reckoning of Deputy Labor Minister Victor Collado -- are working fewer hours at lower pay and reduced benefits. One big construction-materials maker whose sales are off by more than two-thirds has kept everyone on the payroll by trimming work to three days a week. Its general manager -- who asked that he and his firm not be identified -- said it could probably stay afloat through this year.    After that, he says, &quot;if there is no solution, we, and half the companies in the country, will have to close up shop.&quot;    ---   Panama Under Pressure   June 7, 1987 -- Political crisis erupts when Col.
