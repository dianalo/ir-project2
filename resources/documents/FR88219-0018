Summary of Today's Action  </ITAG>Today's action makes available two additional analytical methods for determiningcompliance with existing NPDWRs. They are: (1) The Inductively CoupledPlasma (ICP) Atomic Emission Spectrometric Method for the determinationof arsenic, barium, cadmium, chromium, lead and silver, and (2) the SolidPhase Extraction (SPE) Method for the determination of endrin, lindane,methoxychlor and toxaphene. In addition, the ICP method is being addedto the list of analytical techniques that may be used for determining compliancewith existing NSDWRs for copper, iron, manganese and zinc.  <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Statutory Authority and Regulatory Background</ITAG>A. <T3>Statutory Authority</T3>The SDWA requires the EPA to promulgate NPDWRs which include MCLs or treatmenttechniques which public water systems must meet. SDWA section 1412. NPDWRsalso contain ``criteria and procedures to assure a supply of drinking waterwhich dependably complies with such maximum contaminant levels; includingquality control and testing procedures to ensure compliance with such levels* * * SDWA sections 1401(1)(D); 42 U.S.C. 330F(1)(D). In addition, section1445(b), 42 U.S.C. 300j-4(b), authorizes the Administrator to require monitoringto assist in determing whether persons are acting in compliance with theAct. EPA's promulgation of analytical techniques is authorized under thesesections of the Act.The Act also requires EPA to promulgate NSDWRs for contaminants in drinkingwater that primarily affect the aesthetic qualities relating to the publicacceptance of drinking water. SDWA section 1412. These regulations arenot Federally enforceable but are guidelines for the States. The NSDWRsalso include analytical techniques for determining compliance with theregulations.EPA promulgated NPDWRs in 1975, 1976, 1980, and 1987 for a total of 32drinking water contaminants. <T3>See</T3> 40 CFR 141.11-.16. At the same time, EPA promulgated analyticaltechniques for these contaminants. <T3>See</T3> 40 CFR 141.21-.30. Under these regulations, persons must useone of several approved analytical techniques for determining compliancewith the MCLs. In addition, under 40 CFR 141.27, alternate analytical techniquesmay be used by public water systems upon request and after concurrenceby the State and EPA.B. <T3>Regulatory Background</T3>EPA proposed the approval of two analytical techniques in the October 23,1986 <T4>Federal Register.</T4> (1) The Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) AtomicEmission Spectrometric Method for the determination of arsenic, barium,cadmium, chromium, lead and silver, and (2) the Solid Phase ExtractionMethod for the determination of endrin, lindane, methoxychlor and toxaphene.In addition, the ICP method was proposed for determining compliance withexisting NSDWRs for copper, iron, manganese and zinc.These techniques have been reviewed by EPA and they are deemed equivalentto the EPA's approved test procedures in terms of precision and accuracyat the established MCLs. EPA will reexamine all the approved proceduresas part of its revision of the existing primary drinking water regulationsbeing conducted pursuant to the 1986 amendments to the Safe Drinking WaterAct. Below is a description of these techniques.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP)_Atomic Emission SpectrometricMethod</ITAG>This method (also know as ``EPA Method 200.7'') describes a technique forthe simultaneous or sequential multi-element determination of trace elementsin solution. This method was developed by EPA's Environmental Monitoringand Support Laboratory (EMSL) in Cincinnati and has been validated throughan interlaboratory method study. The Agency proposed the approval of thistechnique for the determination of six primary contaminants_arsenic, barium,cadmium, chromium, lead and silver_and of four secondary contaminants_copper,iron, manganese and zinc. The basis of the method is the measurement ofatomic emission by an optical spectroscopic technique. Samples are nebulizedand the aerosol that is produced is transported to the plasma torch whereexcitation occurs. Characteristic atomic line emission spectra are producedby a radio frequency ICP. The spectra are dispersed by a grating spectrometerand the intensities of the lines are monitored by photomultiplier tubes.The photocurrents from the photomultiplier tubes are processed and controlledby a computer system. A background correction technique is required tocompensate for variable background contribution to the determination oftrace elements. Background must be measured adjacent to analyte lines onsamples during analysis.Pursuant to 40 CFR 141.27, the Agency has granted limited approval in thepast to laboratories requesting the use of Method 200.7 as an alternativeanalytical technique for certain inorganics in drinking water samples.The acceptability of this technique has been demonstrated through variousdata sources including: (1) Performance evaluation study data and (2) theinterlaboratory method validation study (i.e., EPA Method Study 27, Method200.7, Trace Metals by ICP).The Agency developed a concentration technique that allows for the determinationof trace metals at levels significantly lower than the established MCLs.This procedure has been written as an Appendix to Method 200.7 entitled,``Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Analysis of Drinking Water.''The concentration technique requires concentration of samples at leastfour times prior to analysis. The concentration step is necessary becauseMethod 200.7, without concentration of the samples, is not sensitive enoughfor the determination of arsenic and lead at the established MCLs. Thisconcentration technique improves the sensitivity of ICP to other elementalcontaminants as well. EMSL gathered performance data (i.e., precision,accuracy, limits of detection) for the following primary elemental contaminants_arsenic,barium, silver, cadmium, chromium, and lead_and for four secondary elementalcontaminants_copper, iron, manganese, and zinc. These data showed improvedperformance for all the analytes of interest.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Solid Phase Extraction Method</ITAG>The Solid Phase Extraction (SPE) Method describes the use of an SPE proceduredeveloped by J.T. Baker Chemical Company as an alternative to the presentliquid/liquid extraction procedure. The new test procedure is describedin a document entitled, ``Methods for Organochlorine Pesticides and ChlorophenoxyAcid Herbicides in Drinking Water and Raw Source Water.'' This method wasproposed for the analysis of endrin, lindane, methoxychlor, and toxaphene.The method uses a serological polypropylene column which is packed witha 40 um average particle diameter 60Aanddegrees; silica gel covalently bondedand endcapped with a reversed phase organosilane. The packing is held inplace by compression between two 40 um polyethylene frits.After conditioning the column with suitable solvents, the drinking watersample is drawn or forced through the column. The low levels of contaminantsare selectively extracted and concentrated in the packing. Co-extractedinterferences and impurities are selectively removed with a solvent/solutionwash. The compounds of interest are then eluted with a small volume ofsolvent, typically 1 ml. The collected eluants are subsequently analyzedfor organochlorine pesticides using the USEPA-approved test procedure.Use of the Baker Solid Phase columns eliminates the liquid/liquid extractionstep in the USEPA approved test procedure, thereby saving considerabletime and resources. Since the analytes are adsorbed onto the bonded surfaceof the column packing, the extracted compounds of interest are in an ``immobilized''state and the extraction columns can be easily transported to central laboratoriesfor immediate analyte elution.J.T. Baker Chemical Co. completed a study which indicated comparabilityof the SPE technique to the approved technique for four organochlorinepesticides: endrin, lindane, methoxychlor, and toxaphene. Details regardingthe proposed and approved methods used for developing the comparabilitydata, spiking levels, and the data points from analysis of water supplieswere provided in a report to the Agency. (Collaborative Study, ProposedJ.T. Baker Chemical Co. Solid Phase Extraction (SPE) Alternate Test Procedure(ATP); Test Method No. SPE-500 for EPA Test_Methods for OrganochlorinePesticide and Chlorophenoxy Acid Herbicides in Drinking Water and Raw SourceWater, NIPDWR Compliance Monitoring, February 5, 1985). Statistical analysesof the data provided in this report were performed by EMSL-Cincinnati.The results show that in those cases where there were statistical differencesbetween the two methods, the SPE procedure provided more complete recoveryof the compound tested or the SPE procedure was more precise than the EPA-approvedprocedure. Inspection of the recoveries and precision by each method andanalyte indicated that these differences were very small and were insignificantrelative to the applicable maximum contaminant level for endrin, lindane,methoxychlor, and toxaphene.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Comments and Responses</ITAG>EPA requested comments on the suitability of the ICP for determining compliancewith primary and secondary MCLs for metals. EPA also requested commentson the suitability of the Solid Phase Extraction technique for determiningcompliance with four primary MCLs for organochlorine pesticides.EPA received a total of nine comments on the proposed rule. Of these comments,one was a general comment commending EPA for its efforts to approve suitable,new and improved analytical techniques. The other eight commenters providedspecific comments on the ICP technique and/or the SPE technique. Sevencomments addressed the ICP technique and four comments addressed the SolidPhase Extraction (SPE) technique. The commenters were generally in favorof approval of these analytical techniques, with the exception of one negativecomment on the ICP technique and one negative comment on the SPE technique.For each technique, a general summary of the comments received, with EPA'sresponses, are presented below. A detailed comment-response document iscontained in the record for this rulemaking.A. Approval of Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP)_Atomic Emission SpectrometricMethodSeven comments were received concerning the approval of the ICP techniquefor the primary contaminants_arsenic, barium, cadmium, chromium, lead andsilver_and of four secondary contaminants_copper, iron, manganese and zinc.Six commenters agreed with EPA's recommendation for approval of this techniqueand one disagreed with the proposed action. One of the favorable commentersstated that ``the ICP method is routinely used to monitor select inorganicconstituents in various water matrices with success, and the techniqueis considerably more cost-effective than other EPA-approved techniquesfor compliance monitoring.''The commenter opposing approval of the ICP method cited three reasons whythe Agency should not approve the technique for compliance monitoring purposes.First, the commenter claimed that the concentration procedure providedfor in the appendix to the method could potentially cause variability inthe results obtained by the method. The commenter argued that the Agencyshould have assessed the extent of that variability by conducting an interlaboratoryvalidation study of the concentration component of the method. Second,the commenter asserted that the method detection limits cited in the appendixto Method 200.7 were too low; the commenter calculated alternate MDLs inorder to demonstrate that the ICP technique was not sufficiently sensitiveto serve as a monitoring method for lead and arsenic. Third, the commenterclaimed that certain procedures followed in Method Study 27 were flawedand undermined the reliability of the study's results. The discussion belowreponds to each of these comments in turn.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Potential variability due to concentration procedure, and necessityof conducting interlaboratory validation study</ITAG>EPA agrees with the commenter that concentration procedures can introduceadditional variability in the results obtained by an analytical method.However, data gathered and summarized in the appendix to Method 200.7 demonstratethat the overall precision of the method improves significantly as a resultof the four-fold concentration of the sample which is required for drinkingwater samples. The commenter asserts that, in the general population oflaboratories, error added by the concentration step may be sufficientlylarge to offset any additional precision which may be obtained throughconcentration. To judge the variability across different laboratories,the commenter asserts that an interlaboratory study is necessary.EPA rejects these contentions on several grounds. First, EPA believes thatthe concerns expressed by the commenter are addressed by the mandatoryquality control requirements described in the Appendix to Method 200.7.EPA believes that the best way to assure acceptable analytical resultsis to require that each laboratory which proposes to use a method demonstrateits ability to meet specified quality control requirements. As long aslaboratories properly follow the procedures described in the Appendix,the ICP technique will yield satisfactory results. Second, while the precisionand bias estimates in the Appendix to Method 200.7 are based on singlelaboratory data, the Agency has also examined multilaboratory performanceevaluation (PE) data on the ICP Method collected by EPA's EnvironmentalMonitoring and Support Laboratory. These data indicate that better precisionis attained by laboratories using the ICP as opposed to the approved atomicabsorption methods, and refute the commenter's argument that unacceptablevariability will occur during the day-to-day operations of various laboratories.The commenter's position also appears to be based on the erroneous assumptionthat interlaboratory validation studies must always be conducted priorto approval of an analytical technique. While such studies are generallybeneficial, EPA has repeatedly approved the use of alternative analyticaltechniques without having perfomed any interlaboratory studies. This wasthe case with the gas chromatographic methods for trihalomethanes and thefurnace atomic absorption methods for metals which were approved in 1979and 1980, respectively. In 1987, the Agency approved five analytical methodsfor some volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) that were modifications of existingmethods for VOCs without having conducted interlaboratory validation studiesof those methods. The costs to the Agency of conducting interlaboratoryvalidation studies for every analytical method or modification of existingmethods would be prohibitive. Thus, emphasis is given in the drinking waterprogram to the demonstration of the laboratory's ability to attain resultswithin specified accuracy limits. This demonstration of capabilities isan integral part of the Drinking Water Laboratory Certification Program.This program provides a mechanism for the evaluation of laboratories tohelp assure the validity of data generated. Laboratories wishing to analyzecompliance samples must meet the requirements of this program.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Method detection limit of the ICP technique </ITAG>The commenter also objects to approval of the ICP technique on the basisof the requirement written in the appendix to Method 200.7 that the detectionlimits for each element must not exceed one-fifth of its correspondingMCL. Using established procedures contained in 40 CFR Part 136 AppendixB, EPA projected MDLs for each element, and included those MDLs in theAppendix to Method 200.7. The commenter seemed to challenge the validityof these MDLs, and performed calculations using data from Method Study27 (interlaboratory validation of Method 200.7) to project different MDLs.EPA examined the statistical manipulations performed by the commenter andconcluded that many assumptions made by the commenter are not technicallyjustifiable. The manipulation of Method Study 27 data to estimate MDLsdoes not follow the procedure in 40 CFR Part 136 which EPA has determinedis appropriate for determining MDLs. Therefore, EPA believes that the conclusionsderived from these manipulations are inaccurate. Multilaboratory methodstudies are simply not designed to estimate MDLs. The lowest concentrationsactually tested in Method Study 27 are higher than those which, under EPAprocedures, must be used to estimate MDLs (Glaser et. al., <T3>Env. Sci. Tech.,</T3> 15, 1426, 1981). Generally, the use of concentrationshigher than required by EPA procedures results in overestimates of MDLs.As a result, the detection limits calculated by the commenter were toohigh. This is not to say that all laboratories will be able to achievethe method detection limit calculated under ideal research conditions byEPA laboratories. EPA recognizes that detection limits can vary dependingupon the precision attainable by individual laboratories. To minimize thisvariability and insure satisfactory analytical results, Method 200.7 withappendix requires laboratories to demonstrate that they can reliably analyzecompliance samples at the maximum containment levels. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Challenges to design of interlaboratory validation Study_MethodStudy 27 </ITAG>The commenter also questions the appropriateness of that portion of theinterlaboratory study for ICP where participants collected and spiked theirown tap, surface and reagent waters. The commenter expressed concern thatthis practice caused the study results to be non-uniform and, therefore,not of sufficient quality to ensure that the precision and bias of theICP Method 200.7 were acceptable for compliance monitoring purposes. The commenter asserted that this problem arose in connection with the interlaboratoryvalidation study of the furnace atomic absorption methods (Method Study31) because in that study as well, participants collected and spiked theirown samples of reagent, tap and surface waters. According to the commenter,Method Study 31 concluded that the performance data were adversely affectedby this practice. While noting that no such conclusions were drawn in MethodStudy 27, the commenter hypothesized that non-uniformity would have hada negative influence on the precision and bias of the ICP technique, ifthe preconcentration procedure had been studied along with Method 200.7.EPA agrees that concentration may interfere with the recovery of an analytein certain water matrices (i.e., cause matrix effects), but disputes thecommenter's belief that the procedure described in the Appendix to Method200.7 poses such problems. The commenter's reliance on Method Study 31is misplaced. While the study observed some statistically significant matrixeffects for a few elements in surface and effluent waters, no such effectswere noted in the drinking water matrices. This observation indicates thatdrinking water, being relatively free of contaminants, is not likely tocontain many elements which interfere with accurate recoveries of elementsof concern. In addition, the appendix to Method 200.7 addresses potential interferencescaused by concentration of samples. High levels of calcium and magnesiumare the primary interferents which result from concentration of samplesprior to ICP analysis. The method requires that a matrix-matched calibrationstandard be used when the concentration of calcium or calcium and magnesiumcombined exceed certain levels. Laboratories following this practice willnot experience matrix effects due to the concentration procedure containedin the Appendix to Method 200.7. B. Approval of Solid Phase Extraction Method Four comments were received concerning the approval of the SPE techniquefor endrin, lindane, methoxychlor and toxaphene. Three of the commentersagreed with EPA's recommendation for approval of this technique. One ofthese commenters provided specific research references that support theuse of solid-phase extraction methods for organochlorine pesticide analysis.The fourt commenter, the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA), statedthat the applicant, J.T. Baker Chemical Company, failed to establish equivalencyfor the SPE method, and argued, therefore, that this method should notbe granted approval. J.T. Baker conducted a collaborative study to comparethe performance of the proposed SPE method and the USEPA-approved method.The analyses were conducted by two different laboratories, Rutgers Universityand Virginia Polytechnic Institute. J.T. Baker provided a report to theAgency that included the concentration levels used and the data pointsgenerated from analysis of water samples using the proposed and approvedmethods. CMA stated that the Baker ``Collaborative Study'' submitted to EPA in supportof their application does not contain an interpretative text, statisticalevaluation of data, or any interlaboratory assessments of precision andaccuracy. However, the purpose of the J.T. Baker study was only to providethe Agency analytical data using both the proposed and the approved procedures.The Agency does not require the report to contain statistical evaluation,data interpretation, or assessments of precision and accuracy. The subjectreport satisfies the comparability data requirements for nationwide approvalof alternate test procedures. To satisfy these requirements, J.T. Bakerwas instructed to collect drinking water from six geographically dispersedwater supply systems which utilized ground and surface water. From eachsystem, six grab samples were collected, spiked with known amounts of lindane,endrin, methoxychlor, or toxaphene, split, and analyzed eight times; foureach using the approved liquid/liquid extraction method as specified in40 CFR Part 141, and four using the Baker SPE technique.Two EPA laboratories conducted statistical analysis and technical reviewsof the data provided by J.T. Baker. CMA's critique of Baker's collaborativestudy appears to be based on their assumption that the applicant had toprovide statistical analysis of the submitted data. CMA apparently didnot obtain copies of the technical reviews listed under the Public Docket/Referencessection of the proposed rule. During the technical reviews, EPA addressedthe specific issues raised by CMA: (1) That one of the universities involvedin the study experienced serious problems with the recovery/analysis ofmethoxychlor, (2) that there are some questionable results, and (3) thatthere are a high number of false negatives. EPA responses to these issuesare summarized below.1. The commenter correctly points out that one university had difficultywith the recovery/analysis of methoxychlor. However, this difficulty wasexperienced with both the proposed and the approved analytical methods.This problem in quantitation using both analytical methods indicates thatthe preparation technique which is the unique feature of the proposed methodwas not the cause of the recovery problem. Since both the approved andproposed methods utilize identical procedures to determine the presenceand the amount of analyte in a sample, and since there were recovery problemswith both methods, it is likely that those problems were due to deficienciesin the determinative procedure. Therefore, the experience of this laboratorydoes not refute other evidence that the solid phase extraction techniqueis equivalent to the approved analytical methods.2. Approximately forty-one questionable data points were encountered, themajority of which were immediately noticeable by excessively high recoveries.All but five were documentable reporting or calculation errors and werecorrected prior to statistical analysis. The remaining number of questionabledata points is not significant considering the total number of results.3. EPA's review also revealed false negative results, i.e., zero percentrecoveries for an analyte extracted by the SPE procedure when the approvedextraction yielded acceptable recoveries. Of the 960 individual analysesreported, six such results were observed. However, this number is slightlysmaller than the incidence of zero percent recoveries for samples extractedusing the approved procedure when the SPE technique yielded acceptableresults. EPA does not consider the number of false negative results obtainedby the SPE technique to be significant considering the total number ofdata points.In fact, it appears that the SPE technique performed better than the approvedliquid-liquid extraction procedure. The statistical analyses of the comparabilitydata indicated that in those cases where there were statistically significantdifferences between the two methods, the mean recoveries of the SPE procedurewere slightly higher or the SPE procedure was significantly more precisethan the approved technique. Therefore, the Agency maintains that the BakerSPE procedure is suitable for monitoring compliance with MCLs for the fourorganochlorine pesticides: endrin, lindane, methoxychlor, and toxaphene.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Future Review of Analytical Methods</ITAG>EPA is approving the use of these new analytical methods to make them availableto the regulated community as soon as possible. However, the Agency willalso generally examine the approved drinking water methods as part of itspromulgation of MCLs pursuant to the 1986 amendments to the SDWA. BeforeEPA promulgates MCLs for inorganic contaminants and pesticides, the Agencyexpects to reevaluate all methods (including those approved today) anddetermine whether to continue their approval.The analytical method approved today are only applicable to the existingMCLs. Public water systems are cautioned that detection limits for certaininorganic chemicals such as lead and arsenic are higher using the ICP techniquethan with atomic absorption methodology. Thus, the ICP technique may notbe adequate for very low concentrations.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Regulatory Assessment Requirements</ITAG>A. Executive Order 12291Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must judge whether a regulation is ``major''and, therefore, requires a regulatory impact analysis. EPA has determinedthat this regulation is not major as it will not result in an effect onthe economy of $100 million or more, a significant increase in cost orprices, or any of the adverse effects described in the Executive Order.This rule simply specifies two analytical techniques which may be usedby laboratories to measure concentrations of certain pesticides and inorganicchemicals and, therefore, has no adverse economic impacts. However, thisaction was submitted to OMB for their review under the Executive Order.B. Regulatory Flexibility ActThis amendment is consistent with the objectives of the <T3>Regulatory Flexibility Act</T3> (5 U.S.C. 602 <T3>et seq.</T3>) because it will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities. The methods which are includedin this final rule give all laboratories, including small laboratories,the flexibility to use these alternate methods.C. Paperwork Reduction ActThis rule contains no requests for information and is, therefore, exemptfrom the requirements of the <T3>Paperwork Reduction Act</T3>, 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3><ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Effective Date</ITAG>This rule is issued under SDWA section 1401, 1412 and 1445. Although section1412(b) provides that the National Primary Drinking Water Regulations (asdescribed in section 1401) take effect 18 months after their promulgation,under section 1445 there is no such limitation for monitoring, reporting,and recordkeeping regulations which may be used to assist in determiningcompliance. To allow the monitoring methods to be used after 30 days ofpromulgation, EPA is promulgating these regulations under section 1445.Effective 18 months after promulgation, the analytical methods will alsobe deemed to be promulgated under section 1412.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII.
