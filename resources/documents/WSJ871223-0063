An official said the settlement isn't expected to have any significant financial impact on the Portland, Ore.-based mining and resource-development concern.    As previously reported, Houston Industries' Utility Fuels Inc. unit last year sued Nerco, seeking a court judgment that would allow them to either break a 1978 agreement with Nerco's Spring Creek Coal unit, or pay less for coal for which they had contracted. The Texas utility was concerned state regulators intended to reduce the maximum price for coal it would be allowed to pass on to consumers. Nerco said the agreement calls for its unit to buy coal from other suppliers at a lower price, then sell it to the Houston unit for a lower price than had been agreed upon in the contract.    In return, Houston's unit paid Nerco the disputed $106 million it has been setting aside since last summer. Nerco, which is 90% owned by PacifiCorp, a Portland utility holding company, said it had been booking the disputed money as revenue, so any financial impact will be &quot;minimal.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
