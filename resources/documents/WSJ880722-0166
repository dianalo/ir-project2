Party strategists say the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket improves the odds of holding the Senate. They say Dukakis gives them a shot at several New England seats. Bentsen is seen helping in some Southern states, such as Florida, where Democrats are struggling, and in Mississippi's close race.    House Democratic campaign chief Anthony predicts that Democrats will add three to five House seats. Two of them could come in Texas, aided by Bentsen's drawing power. But Republican strategist Joseph Gaylord says the national ticket will make little difference, citing 1984, when the GOP gained only 14 seats despite Reagan's landslide. He also predicts defeat for a few tainted Democratic incumbents.    A Senate Democratic campaign official says that &quot;there's none of the sentiment from 1984, when guys didn't want their pictures taken with the ticket.&quot;    STARS ARE BORN -- and some dim -- at the Democratic gathering.    Keynoter Ann Richards gets a boost for her hopes to become Texas governor. John F. Kennedy Jr. and Jesse Jackson Jr. both make dazzling television debuts. But Arkansas Gov. Clinton stumbles with his long-winded nominating speech. Meanwhile, jockeying begins in earnest for top jobs in any Dukakis administration.    Former party chairman Strauss, who once envisioned himself as secretary of state, now eyes the Treasury. Others say House Budget Chairman Gray, a Jackson backer, has a better shot if he wants it. Jackson convention chief Ron Brown impresses many, and could get a top White House slot or the party's chairmanship if he gives up his lucrative lobbying work.    REPUBLICANS ADMIT Dukakis avoided Atlanta convention pitfalls.    GOP strategists grudgingly admire the Democrats' Republican-like show of unity. &quot;The notion that there'd be some damage from chaos has been thoroughly dispelled,&quot; says former Reagan political director Mitch Daniels. Republicans say Dukakis succeeded in avoiding any perception that he made a detailed &quot;deal&quot; with Jackson, which would have made him appear weak.    But they say Dukakis may suffer in the long run because he failed to grab the convention spotlight early and was overshadowed by Jackson. Daniels hopes the convention helps &quot;get conservatives off their duffs.&quot; Bush campaign chief Atwater grouses that the &quot;theme of the convention is deceit&quot; because Democrats masked their liberal bent.    Republicans plan to use surveys of delegate views on tax increases to argue that the Democratic Party is more liberal than Dukakis claims.    LOW PROFILE: Despite having a record number of delegates at the Democratic convention, organized labor took an all-but-invisible role, eschewing the platform debate and preaching party unity. &quot;It's absolutely what we wanted,&quot; claims AFL-CIO official Rex Hardesty. &quot;We came here wanting to start on November. We want to be together, we want to have a winner.&quot;    BENTSEN-BASHING: Republicans say they will ask the Federal Election Commission to bar public funds for the Dukakis campaign unless Bentsen agrees not to spend more for his Senate race. The FEC probably won't act, but the GOP could then sue, generating publicity.    WOMEN ADVANCE in the macho world of Democratic high rollers. Washington businesswoman Susan Hager astonishes party professionals by raising $100,000. Houston lawyer Collyn Peddie's &quot;100 Women&quot; group does the same, helped by a mid-afternoon event here. She says, &quot;We've had power lunches, now we're into power teas.&quot;    HELPING HAND? Democrats wonder who will be Bush's running mate, figuring the Bentsen choice has thrown the GOP off stride. Many doubt Bush will pick Dole, the current favorite. Sen. Bradley suggests Bush needs a well-known Californian with government experience: &quot;Ed Meese.&quot;    JACKSON LOOKS AHEAD to the fall campaign -- and beyond.    Aides say he plans an active, six-day-a-week campaign for the ticket. Some Dukakis lieutenants anticipate differences with him over issues; Bush campaign chief Atwater already starts referring to the &quot;Jackson-Dukakis-Bentsen&quot; ticket. Jackson still pushes the notion of becoming a crisis negotiator in a Dukakis administration.    Jackson's post-election plans include building up his political action arm, with emphasis on a training program for young black political activists. Associates haven't any doubt that he will run for president again. &quot;In 2004, Jesse will be 62,&quot; says a top black politician, &quot;and as long as he's around no other black is going to emerge.&quot;    One long shot: If Dukakis could succeed in the uphill fight to make the District of Columbia a state, Jackson could become a senator.    MINOR MEMOS: The Sacramento Bee's schedule of convention events lists a tribute to &quot;the late Rep. Morris Udall.&quot; Comments the congressman: &quot;It's news to me.&quot; . . . Discussing Bush, Texan Ann Richards says people in her state have a word to describe someone who has a house in Maine and stays in a Houston hotel room: &quot;tourist.&quot; . . . How soon they forget: A big sign in the convention's press center directs journalists to &quot;Wooddrow Wilson Blvd.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
