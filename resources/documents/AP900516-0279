On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the June contract for WestTexas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, lost 56cents to settle at $19.03 a 42-gallon barrel, after dropping 12cents Tuesday.   Other contract months also declined.   James Steel, an energy analyst with Refco Inc., attributed thecrude dropoff to a report by the American Petroleum Instituteshowing a sharp rise in crude stocks.

The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries earlier agreedto a quota of 22 million barrels a day.   Among refined petroleum products traded on the New York Merc,wholesale unleaded gasoline for June delivery rose 0.66 cent to64.17 cents a gallon. The contract gained 0.54 cent Tuesday.
