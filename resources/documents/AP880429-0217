Col. Oliver L. North and three Iran-Contra co-defendantsof a fair trial, the defense said Friday.   Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA) requirements thatthe defense serve notice of any plans to disclose classifiedinformation in court will give the prosecution an unfair advantage,the defense said in a motion filed in U.S. District Court.   The requirement ``imposes burdens on the defense unprecedentedin American criminal law,'' lawyers for the fired National SecurityCouncil aide and his three co-defendants said in a joint motion.   ``In the circumstances of this singular case involving anunprecedented volume of classified documents'' the requirement is``clearly unconstitutional,'' the defense said.   North, former national security adviser John M. Poindexter,busisinessmen Albert Hakim and retired Air Force Maj. Gen. RichardV. Secord are accused of conspiring to defraud the governent bydiverting U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan Contrarebels.   Under the law, the defense would be barred from using classifiedevidence in the trial unless it notifies the prosecution before thetrial of all government secrets it plans to disclose.   The requirement ``forces the defendants to furnish theprosecution virtually every detail of the defense case, includingthe defendants' anticipated testimony at trial, the testimony ofother defense witnesses'' and the contents of all classifieddocuments the lawyers intend to introduce as evidence or use tocross-examine prosecution witnesses, the defense said.   ``This sweeping notice requirement ... violates the defendants'fundamental constitutional rights, including such basic guaranteesas the privilege against compelled self-incrimination, the right toeffective assistance of counsel, the right to cross-examine adversewitnesses and the right to due process of law,'' the defense said.   The requirement also deprives the defendants of the right todecide during the trial whether they want to testify in their owndefense.   ``If the defendants do not include the substance of theiranticipated testimony in their notice, then they run a grave riskthat the court will preclude large portions of their testimony,''the defense said.   ``On the other hand, the defense lacks the information necessaryto make an informed decision that the defendants will testify,since the defense does not know how the prosecution's case willfare at any trial,'' the brief said.   The problem is particularly acute because the indictment, asdescribed by U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell, ``alleges acourse of conduct carried out using classified materials inclassified channels from a highly classified site.''   The difficulty is compounded by the large volume of documents.Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh has said as many as 50,000pages of classified documents collected during his investigationare relevant to the case.   And Gesell has ruled that the defense should have an opportunityto examine relevant portions of another 250,000 pages.   ``The defense can reasonably predict that hundreds of thousandsof pages of classified material not yet inventoried, and volumes ofclassified testimony, will ultimately be involved in the case,''said the joint motion by lawyers for the four defendants.   The defense motion illustrated the difficulty of applying thedisclosure rule to cross-examination.   ``Armed with the defendant's notice,'' Walsh can tailor his case``to blunt the force of the defense cross-examination. The noticemay alert the prosecution to specific areas of vulnerability ofwhich it had been not aware.''</TEXT></DOC>
