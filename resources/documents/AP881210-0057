(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Viewers will see a new Jim Bakker when thefounder of the PTL television ministry and his wife tape several TVspecials from their living room, one of his attorneys said.   ``I think we'll see a more introspective and cautious Jim Bakkerin his message,'' attorney Jim Toms said Friday. ``His new publicministry will be targeted not just to Christian charismatics but tohurting people.   ``He has a lot to share about what he has learned,'' Toms said.   Jim and Tammy Bakker plan to tape several TV specials from theliving room of their 14-room log cabin near Pineville, Toms said.   ``He's hoping to get on the air in the next 30 days,'' he said.   Bakker has not had a regular TV show since he resigned from theministry in March 1987 in the wake of a sex-and-money scandal. Hehas been preaching recently at a converted skating rink inCharlotte, where his New Covenant Church is based.   Bakker has not spoken publicly since his indictment Monday onfederal fraud and conspiracy charges. Bakker, 48, and a top aide atPTL are accused of diverting more than $4 million of PTL money tosupport their own ``lavish and extravagant'' lifestyles.   PTL, in bankruptcy reorganization since June 1987, must sell itsassets to pay creditors. A federal bankruptcy judge in Columbia,S.C., has scheduled an auction for Monday.   Toms said Bakker will likely preach Sunday about what he haslearned from his experiences. ``My expectation is that he'll bethere (at the church) and he'll have something to say,'' said Toms.``Getting his message out is important.''</TEXT></DOC>
