Machine data is acquired by a VAX-CAMAC interface,an is passed to these utilities in an efficient manner by memory mappingto global sections for on-line manipulation. The data can also be readilyanalyzed off-line by operators with the user-friendly command drivenutilities OPDATA and PLOTDATA which permit the user to obtain graphicsoutput on a variety of terminal and hardcopy devices using device independentmetafiles. Sample applications show the usefulness of these utilitiesfor a wide range of tasks, such as real-time simulation of trim-coiltuning on the beam phase history, and semi-on-line analysis of radialprobe data.</TEXT></DOC>
