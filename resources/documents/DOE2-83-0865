These spectra contain informationabout the relative importance of processes with one or more active electrons.The ratio between cross sections for transfer ionization and single-electroncapture reaches a maximum around q = 25 and decreases for higher q. We,tentatively, ascribe this observation to an increasing probability forradiative stabilization of doubly excited states for qandgt;25.</TEXT></DOC>
