An army bulletin broadcast on television said Mahdi, 53, had beenhiding in the home of Mohamed Hassan Khalifa Sherif, who was notidentified further.   ``The house was surrounded, and while a team was searching it,Sadek Mahdi jumped out of a small balcony overlooking the street butwas immediately arrested carrying a letter to the RevolutionaryCouncil,'' the bulletin said.   It did not disclose the contents of the letter or say what floorthe balcony was on.   Mahdi, elected in May 1986, went into hiding after a militarycoup last Friday. Soon after the coup, the junta arrested at 45senior politicians and members of the ousted regime.   Rumors circulated that Mahdi was outside the capital, protectedby his followers, or secretly in detention. Junta leader OsmanHassan Ahmed Bashir insisted, however, that he had not left Khartoumand soon would be arrested.   Hours before the arrest was announced, Col. Suleiman Mohamed, amember of the junta, denied reports that Mahdi had sent wordrequesting a guarantee of personal safety before turning himself in.   Earlier Thursday, Col. Hassan Dahawy told The Associated Pressthe former premier had been caught in Khartoum.   ``We have arrested Mahdi,'' he said. ``We are geting the radioand televison to interview him live in a short time to show thepeople.''   Three hours later, however, only the bulletin describing thearrest was broadcast.   On Thursday night, junta leader Bashir announced a decreeestablishing committees to investigate ``financial andadministrative irregularities'' under the former regime.   In an interview conducted before Mahdi's arrest, Egypt'sstate-run newspaper Al-Akhbar quoted Bashir as indicating the oustedpremier would be treated as harshly as anyone else if convicted ofcorruption.   ``His corrupt practices have ruined all services of thecountry,'' the junta leader was quoted as saying. ``All thoseresponsible for this destruction will be violently hit.''   The interview was published in Friday's editions of the newspaper.   Bashir also said ``specialized courts'' of three militaryofficers each would try people charged with violating lawsregulating market prices, customs and public order, with death asthe maximum penalty.   Bashir, 43, has said his priority for reform is fightingcorruption as a first step to improving the economy and nationalsecurity.   Mahdi's government was buffeted by street demonstrations againsthigh prices and severe shortages of basic goods.   The new military leader accuses ousted officials of destroyingthe economy and hesitating too long to organize peace talks to end aruinous war in the south that was costing the government $1 milliona day while it ran up a foreign debt of $13 billion.   Rebels began fighting in 1983 for more autonomy and developmentin the south, where a Sudan's minority of black Christians andanimists lives. The government and military are by the dominant ArabMoslems.   The war has induced famine that claimed hundreds of thousands oflive in the south of Sudan, Africa's largest country.   On Monday, Bashir was quoted as inviting rebel leader JohnGarang, a former army colonel, to Khartoum for talks to end therebellion. The new leadership earlier canceled peace talks arrangedby Mahdi's government for Monday in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.   Last year, army threatened to move against Mahdi unless hespeeded efforts to end the war. The United States and othercountries threatened to withhold aid for the same reason.   Mahdi finally suspended harsh Islamic laws, which met a rebeldemand negotiations, and talks started in May.   Part of Mahdi's problem was that he is a great-grandson of theMahdi, whose fervent Moslem followers defeated a British colonialforce and brought brief independence to Sudan in the late 1800s. Themantle of religious leadership caused him to avoid decisions thatmay have been interpreted as anti-Moslem. </TEXT></DOC>
