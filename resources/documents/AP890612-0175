The government on Monday gave security forces permission to shootpeople who incite unrest and outlawed all independent student andworker groups.   Fang and his wife Li Shuxian have been sequestered in the U.S.Embassy in Beijing since a military crackdown on pro-democracyprotests on June 3. They are accused by the government of``committing crimes of counterrevolutionary propaganda andinstigation.''   Beijing's Public Security Bureau issued orders Tesday that``other provinces, other cities, all airports and all guards on theborder should carry out the arrest warrant'' against Fang and hiswife. The order was read over Beijing radio.   The government has strongly protested to the United States forgiving shelter to Fang, calling it interference in China's internalaffairs.   In Washington the State Department said Chinese security forcessurrounded the embassy in an obvious effort to keep other dissidentsfrom taking refuge there.   Chinese television broadcast photographs of Fang and his wifeMonday night.   ``Don't let these people flee,'' the announcer said. ``They arewanted for counterrevolutionary crimes.''   Fang, a renowned astrophysicist, played no active role in recentstudent-led demonstrations for democratic reforms. However, he hasbeen an outspoken critic of the Communist Party, saying the Marxistsystem has failed here and economic reform will not work unlessaccompanied by sweeping political reform.   U.S. Secretary of State James Baker and other departmentofficials met with China's ambassador in Washington, Han Xu, overthe weekend to discuss the Fang case. The Bush administrationindicated earlier it would not let the Chinese arrest the Fangs.   The U.S. Embassy compound is regarded as American soil underinternational law, and Chinese authorities cannot enter without theembassy's permission.   The attacks on Fang are part of a nationwide propaganda campaignto discredit the pro-democracy movement and justify the harshmilitary crackdown in Beijing that killed or injured thousands ofpeople, including many students.   The government on Monday told police and soldiers nationwide theyhad the right to shoot ``rioters and counterrevolutionaries.'' Atthe same time it banned independent student and worker associations.   Security forces made hundreds of further arrests, includingseveral leaders of independent labor unions, bringing the number ofannounced arrests to more than 1,000 across China.   All developments pointed to a strengthening of the government'seffort to suppress the movement for a freer society and an end toofficial corruption.   The crackdown began June 3 when thousands of soldiers from thePeople's Liberation Army entered Beijing and marched on TiananmenSquare, which was occupied by thousands of students.   China's government says nearly 300 people were killed, mostlysoldiers. However, Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence saidthe toll could be as high as 3,000, most of them civilians.   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler challenged Chinesegovernment assertions that troops did not fire on students massed inTiananmen. ``The whole world has seen what happened,'' she saidMonday.   Ms. Tutwiler said if Deng Xiaoping, China's senior leader, ``wasresponsible for the brutal attack on Tiananmen Square, then he hasacted to undercut the very reform process he has sought to foster.''   In Ottawa, External Affairs Minister Joe Clark said Canada'sambassador in Beijing is being recalled temporarily to protest thekillings.   The widening crackdown was further evidence that hardliners ledby Deng have gained control of the government after a power strugglewith leaders more sympathetic to student demands.   One Western diplomat described the present situation in Beijingas a ``cold terror aimed at cowing the population.''   ``Several of us have seen arrests made at gunpoint and policebeating people in the streets,'' he said Monday, speaking oncondition of anonymity. ``From what we've seen in the last few dayswe can't seriously expect the police or troops to be fussy about whothey shoot.''   Chinese media said life in Beijing had returned to normal and buslines were running and banks were open.   But posters began appearing asking for information aboutrelatives who disappeared in the violent suppression.   Fear has spread through the capital. Chinese have begun refusingto see foreign reporters and report that among their work units,movement has begun to ferret out pro-democracy supporters.   In a statement foreshadowing a possible purge in the rulingCommunist Party, Beijing Vice-Mayor Huang Chao called on every partyorganization to look at the movement ``as a severe test for everyCommunist Party member.''   The Ministry of Public Security said police and soldiers shoulduse their weapons against ``rioters and counterrevolutionaries'' tocurb criminal activity, defined as ``disrupting social order'' and``riots.''   It marked the first time the government acknowledged that policeand soldiers nationwide have been given the right to fire onprotesters.   State-run radio and TV said hundreds of arrests were made Mondayin the provincial capitals of Hangzhou, Xian, Nanjing and Shanghai.Among the arrested in Shanghai were Li Zhibo, a leader of theindependent workers union, and Yao Yongzhan, a 19-year-old Hong Kongstudent.   Li was shown being held at gunpoint by police. It appeared he hadbeen beaten. His face was swollen so badly he could barely open hiseyes.   Protest supporters in Shanghai, China's largest city with 12million people, said Monday that authorities had snuffed out thedemocracy movement there through intimidation and arrests.   In its statement, the Ministry of Public Security banned studentand worker groups that headed the pro-democracy movement, andordered their leaders to turn themselves in immediately. If theydidn't, they would be punished severely, it said.   Chinese media accused the Voice of America, listened to widely inChina, of ``spreading rumors'' about the disturbances.</TEXT></DOC>
