(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Shopping for a PC DBMSandM;Probing the vast reaches of outer space might seem to call for theorganizational muscle of a mainframe database.andP;  But at the Jet PropulsionLaboratory in Pasadena, Calif., all of the application development for theMagellan satellite launch project has been done on personal computers usingBritton Lee's ShareBase database system.andM;This is only one example of how PC databases have matured and met thechallenge on jobs previously reserved for software running on largerplatforms.andP;  In the process, the PC DBMS has grown in three major areas:power, ease of use, and connectivity.andM;Randall Sutherland, an analyst at San Jose-based Dataquest, projects thatsales of standalone PC DBMS products will have an 18% compound annual growthrate until at least 1992, and database products networked to DBMS serverswill enjoy a 240% compound annual growth rate.andM;The power of current PC DBMSs can partially be attributed to hardwareinnovations, such as Intel's 80386 chip, which offers both great speed andmultitasking.andP;  However, creativity on the part of software developers hasalso led to unusual applications.andP;  For instance, askSam (from askSam Systems)has the ability to store and retrieve data in almost any form, with noconventional organization at all.andM;Advances in ease of use can be seen in two areas: text-based programs such asDataEase (from DataEase International Inc.), with which novices can buildrelational applications without programming, and graphical-based programsthat display options in pictorial form, to be selected by the mere click of amouse.andP;  Both the Macintosh computer's success and the emergence of thePresentation Manager version of the OS/2 operating system have greatlyaccelerated the acceptance of graphical interfaces.andM;But the real hot button in the PC world is connectivity, sparked by theacceptance of SQL, the query language developed in the '70s by IBM for use onits mainframes.andP;  Now the publishers of PC database products are addingsupport for SQL as fast as their programmers can write the code.andP;  The goal isto enable PCs to exchange data at any time with any platform, regardless ofits size or location.andM;Even disparate applications like word processors and spreadsheets must beable to swap information instantly with today's PC database.andM;All the major players in this market have been unusually active.andO;Ashton-Tate, hoping to retain dBase position as the PC industry standard, hasfinally shipped dBase IV.andP;  It has many new features, including a built-incompiler and an interface called the Control Center, which enablesnonprogrammers to create simple applications.andM;Unfortunately, the initial release of dBase IV has a number of bugs.andP;  It'sincompatible in some respects with dBase III Plus, and SQL is implementedonly on a local level, through a separate, tacked-on module.andP;  Furthermore,data processing in dBase is record-oriented, while SQL is set-oriented,requiring that dBase translate every query before passing it on to SQL.andM;The next release of dBase IV, version 1.1, will go far toward correcting thissituation, says Ashton-Tate.andP;  Of course, the bugs and incompatibilities willbe addressed.andP;  And 1.1 will support SQL Server, a database server jointlymarketed by Ashton-Tate and Microsoft.andP;  So far, no date has been set for theupgrade.andM;Microrim's New DBMS Is DifferentandM;Microrim, publishers of the R:Base series of database products, has a newproduct that's so different from R:Base that it will even have a new name.andO;It's been developed hush-hush under the code name Atlas and is expected to beavailable later this year.andM;Marco Hegyi, Microrim's vp of marketing, says: &quot;Atlas has a client/serverstructure, with both ends intelligent.andP;  The interface will be graphical.andO;It's being developed first to run under OS/2.andP;  Then we'll have Macintosh,VAX/VMS, Ultrix, and other versions for larger computers, with tools forapplication development.&quot;andP;  Once an application has been written, Hegyi adds,&quot;it'll run under any system.andP;  And users will be able to cut and paste withoutprogramming.&quot;andM;Asked about SQL support in the new product, Hegyi explains, &quot;We're adheringto ANSI level 2 standards--extended SQL between the server and the clients.andO;It'll be possible to mix clients in the same system; for example, some of theclients might be VAX and others Macintosh.andP;  We're using a distributed system,with a two-stage commit.andP;  And our engine will talk to other engines; thatprotects the customer's investment.&quot;andM;In addition, Atlas databases can have hierarchies, and they will havecharting capabilities and be able to store graphical images, says Hegyi.andM;With graphical storage capabilities, a personnel database can include in eachrecord a photo of the employee; home builders can store floor plans of theirmodels; and a database of fast-food outlets can contain maps showing wherethe facilities are located.andP;  This technology is already available in DBMSproducts now on the market, running under MS-DOS.andM;A good example of this type of product is Superbase 4, developed in Englandand marketed in the U.S.andP;  through Precision Inc.andP;  Versions are sold to runeither in the GEM environment from Digital Research or under MicrosoftWindows.andP;  It can store either bit-mapped images or line art.andP;  Unlike dBaseIV, Superbase 4 has a communications module.andP;  With its programming language,users can perform tricks like automatically downloading files from branchoffices in the middle of the night when phone rates are low.andM;The number of fields in a Superbase 4 file is unlimited, whereas in dBase IVthe maximum is 255.andP;  Other features include multiple-response fields,multiple-file posting, three-dimensional arrays, and the capacity to linklarge external text files to its database records.andP;  SQL support is comingsoon.andM;Of course, graphical-based databases are nothing new on the Macintosh,although few except for Apple's HyperCard and Odesta's Double Helix II willactually store graphical images.andM;Blyth Software's Omnis 3 Plus, one of the most popular Mac database products,was ported over to the MS-DOS Windows environment under the name OmnisQuartz.andP;  It has no ability to store graphical images and no SQL support, butthe latest release has a data file structure that's compatible with the Macproduct.andP;  This means that, with LAN versions, both Omnis 3 Plus users onMacintoshes and Quartz users on MS-DOS computers can access the same data atthe same time, with file and record locking.andM;Borland International's Paradox has a new release, which has added graphics,crosstabs, and the simultaneous display of records from multiple tables.andP;  TheParadox Application Language (PAL) has been enhanced with better screencontrol and memory management and more commands and functions.andM;The Paradox solution to SQL connectivity is to let the user access datathrough the simple query-by-example format introduced in the product in 1985;the program will transparently convert the QBE query into SQL syntax.andP;  Theaccessory product that will accomplish this has not been priced yet, but isexpected to be available before the end of the second quarter of this year.andM;A burgeoning group of PC database products have migrated down from largercomputers.andP;  These have obvious advantages for companies that would like theiremployees to use one DBMS program, with one set of commands to be learned,across the entire spectrum of their available platforms.andM;4GLs in VogueandM;And in this product group, software publishers with mainframe-to-PC productsnow often advertise that they offer a 4GL application development language.andO;A well-designed 4GL is built with specific applications, such as databases,in mind.andP;  Furthermore, it can use nonprocedural statements, and responds toEnglish-like syntax that describes the desired result; the language suppliesthe procedure.andP;  SQL statements are now supported by several of these database4GLs.andM;Focus, one of the first commercially successful 4GLs and database systems,was introduced in 1976 by Information Builders Inc., a New York-based companyco-founded by 4GL pioneer Gerald Cohen.andP;  Today the Focus language and DBMSconstitute one of the most widely installed 4GL DBMS systems in the world andcan be found in almost every computing environment.andM;PC/Focus was launched in 1983.andP;  The latest version, 4.0, lets the user typeSQL statements interactively to query PC/Focus files.andP;  The programtransparently translates the SQL syntax into Focus code and runs the request.andO;Support of SQL-based DBMS engines is accomplished by translating Focusstatements into SQL syntax and passing them on to the SQL database engine.andO;Version 4.0 also has a new forms painter--a full-screen interface to theFocus reporting language.andM;Informix-4GL, the 4GL database language from Informix Software Inc., wasintroduced in 1986.andP;  It contains ANSI-standard SQL, and optional &quot;EmbeddedProducts&quot; permit the embedding of SQL query statements in C, COBOL, and Adacode as well, converted automatically through a precompiler.andM;A new Informix Rapid Development System for MS-DOS reduces development timethrough the use of a pseudo-code system.andP;  Code is compiled into p-code andexecuted by a p-code runner, eliminating the necessity of using a C compilerand a C linker.andP;  An Interactive Debugger works with this system to permit thesimultaneous development and debugging of applications in an interactive,windowed environment.andM;RAMIS migrated down from the IBM mainframes to PCs in 1986, and the latestversions from On-Line Software International Inc. cover both individualworkstations and, finally, LAN installations (Release 3.0).andP;  They incorporatea relational database manager, both menu- and command-based 4GL reportingcapabilities, and seamless connectivity to mainframes, although SQL is notyet supported.andP;  A full-screen editor has been added.andM;Progress, from Progress Software Corp., is another DBMS available on multipleplatforms that has not supported SQL.andP;  This shortcoming has been corrected inVersion 5, which is scheduled to ship in a matter of weeks.andP;  Progress has astrong 4GL language and is less expensive and easier to use than most of its4GL RDBMS rivals.andP;  A Fast Track application builder makes it possible tocreate applications largely through the use of menus.andM;Extended Memory SupportandM;Oracle Corp. provides Professional Oracle in matching versions for more than30 operating systems.andP;  The PC version has an extension to MS-DOS that letsits database engine execute above the 640KB RAM barrier, in extended memory.andO;Since extended memory, unlike expanded memory, is available only on computerswith 80286 or 80386 processors, hardware in these classes is required to runOracle.andP;  The main advantages of this support for extended memory are thecapacity for processing very large applications and the release of most ofthe memory below 640KB for purposes like running memory-resident utilities.andM;The SQL support in Professional Oracle is so complete that even the promptinside the program is &quot;SQLandgt;.&quot;andP;  There is no 4GL language, but a menu-drivenmodule called SQL*Forms helps novices create applications withoutprogramming.andM;Oracle is forging links to SQL servers, but has made no recent enhancementsto the PC version itself.andM;Relational Technology Inc. recently introduced Ingres/386, a version of itspopular Ingres RDBMS that is intended for Compaq 386 personal computers andcompatibles running Unix.andP;  The similar MS-DOS version contains the samedevelopment tools, database manager, and front-end facilities, includingIngres 4GL, a visual forms editor, report writer, a C-language interface, anda query-by-forms module.andP;  SQL is fully supported.andM;XDB-SQL is a highly regarded MS-DOS DBMS from XDB Systems Inc. that offers afull SQL implementation, including preprocessors for Micro Focus and RealiaCOBOL compilers as well as Microsoft C and Turbo Pascal.andM;Some purchasers use XDB as a workbench to develop DB2 applications.andP;  Amongother useful features are menus to guide the uninitiated and optional formsand graphics modules for printing reports and charts.andP;  An MS-DOS file serveris available too, plus a Unix version of the system.andM;Britton Lee's ShareBase is in a category all by itself.andP;  It's an RDBMS thatsupports SQL and has been designed to work with the company's own hardware.andO;The software bypasses the operating system to send commands directly to thecontroller of a Britton Lee server, so ShareBase processes data much faster.andO;The hardware can coexist with other servers on a network.andM;In addition to handling the Magellan satellite launch program mentionedabove, ShareBase has even replaced a mainframe system to manage the ConsumerPrice Index for the Department of Labor, with three Britton Lee serversoperating as back ends over 100 PCs and 15 Metaphor workstations.andM;Advanced Revelation, from Revelation Technologies, has an OS/2 versionscheduled for release next month, and Advanced Revelation/SQL is penciled into ship in August.andP;  In the meantime, the developer is forging &quot;environmentalbonds&quot; to other products; files are attached in their native format toAdvanced Revelation, with data thereafter accessed as if resident in an ARfile.andP;  Bonds are already available for AutoCAD, Prime, and DEC VAX/VMSformats.andM;Clarion Software offers Clarion Professional Developer, which has astructured language that is similar to Pascal.andP;  It also offers ClarionPersonal Developer, with which nonprogrammers can create relationalapplications in a matter of minutes, using a fill-in-the-blanks interface.andO;The program comes with eight ready-to-run applications that can be modifiedto suit individual needs.andM;Another RDBMS noted for its friendliness is DataEase International'sDataEase, which through the years has gained an increasing share of themarket.andP;  The latest version, released in January, adds over 70 enhancements,such as multiform viewing and editing, the ability to display and edit datain either form or tabular formats, and an improved query language, as well asincreased processing speed and support for expanded memory.andP;  The languageisn't SQL yet, but an optional utility, DataEase Connect, provides amicro-to-mainframe link.andM;Symantec Corp. has released an OS/2 version of its Qandamp;A flat-file databaseprogram, which retains its famous natural language interface.andP;  The MS-DOSversion now supports Intel's Connection Coprocessor, making possible faxoperations from within the program.andM;Clipper from Nantucket Corp. hasn't been upgraded since the summer of 1987,but the present release makes the product a dBase compiler as well a databasedevelopment system.andM;The company also publishes McMax, a text-based relational database system forthe Macintosh that, to a large extent, ignores the traditional Macintoshgraphical interface, but provides compatibility with the dBase commandlanguage.andP;  A developer can create an application in dBase running underMS-DOS or McMax on the Macintosh and run it on the other platform with littleor no modification.andM;Also offering dBase compatibility is Fox Software's FoxBase+/Mac, while atthe same time retaining the Mac look and feel.andM;Other Macintosh database products include dBase Mac from Ashton-Tate, which,ironically, will not run PC dBase applications at all and, in fact, is basedon a graphical-based Mac program purchased from another developer.andP;  dBase Macis overshadowed by other products in the field, with Omnis 3 Plus, taking thebiggest share of the Mac market.andM;Odesta Corp.'s Double Helix II, has taken the opposite approach from McMax.andO;Rather than text-based, it's operated almost entirely through the use oficons.andP;  Intricate applications can be built with this system.andP;  The number offiles per database, fields and records per file, and total links allowed areall unlimited.andP;  Double Helix's current version is 2.0; a new release isscheduled for the second quarter.andM;Unlike Double Helix II, Acius Inc.'s 4th Dimension has a complete,Pascal-like programming language.andP;  The product is very powerful, althoughslower in execution than its competitors, and it even lets the user submitSQL statements from within the program.andM;Apple's HyperCard is not a traditional database program in any sense.andP;  Ituses a hierarchical structure, in which one subject can lead to another.andP;  Itcan store graphical images, and even sounds.andP;  Third-party developers haveenthusiastically supported this software, creating a myriad ofapplications--called stacks--to exploit its unusual architecture.andM;An upgrade of Hypercard may be announced shortly, although it will probablynot ship until later this year.andM;Ken Einstein, director of database strategy for Borland, believes that in thenext three to five years most DBMS products will store images and sounds aswell as documents.andP;  &quot;They'll all be objects,&quot; he predicts, &quot;with intelligenceprovided for their manipulation.andP;  There will definitely be an increase inexpert databases that will have a semantic knowledge of their own content.&quot;andO;Einstein also foresees a greater use of graphical interfaces.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
