These include: Researchon scintillating glass fiber materials; Research on scintillating plasticfiber materials; Research on scintillating liquids in fiber capillaries;Studies of improvements in image intensification and light amplificationof appropriate test and development facilities at Notre Dame. The overallgoal of the program is to develop efficient scintillating fiber detectorswith long, optical attenuation length, and excellent radiation resistanceproperties for tracking and microvertex detectors and as component activesampling materials for scintillation calorimetry. We now discuss eachof these programs in turn. 2 figs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
