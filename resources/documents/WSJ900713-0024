(AP) -- Gov. Mario Cuomo signed legislationdesigned to restrict the use and sale of ozone-depletingchemicals that are widely used in refrigeration systems, airconditioners and fire extinguishers.   The new law restricts and, in some cases, bans the sale ofchlorofluorocarbons and halons. Both have been found tocontribute to the depletion of the earth's ozone layer and toadd to global warming. The ozone layer protects the earthfrom dangerous ultraviolet rays of the sun that can causeskin cancer, eye cataracts and other problems.</LP><TEXT>   Chlorofluorocarbons are coolants that are commonly used inrefrigeration systems and air conditioners. Under the newlaw, CFCs will have to be recaptured and recycled whenlarge-scale refrigeration systems and mobile air conditionersare serviced. CFCs will also have to be recaptured whenequipment that uses them is disposed of.   In addition, the new law bans the sale of residential fireextinguishers that use halons and the sale of CFCs orcoolants in 14-ounce cans. The restrictions will be phased induring the next two years.   Gov. Cuomo said that, while the new law was a goodmeasure, it does not go far enough toward eliminating the useof the chemicals -- a move that would be much better for theenvironment.</TEXT></DOC>
