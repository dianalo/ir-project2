Loury, a Harvard University professor who withdrew from consideration for an administration post after he was charged with assault.    Mr. Loury had been expected to be nominated as undersecretary of education in June. However, he withdrew after a friend, Pamela Foster, filed charges against him, including threats to commit a crime, assault and battery and malicious destruction of property.    Mr. Loury would have been the second-highest ranking black official in the administration had he taken the education department job.    The Suffolk County district attorney's office said charges were dropped after Ms. Foster declined to press her complaint. Steven Wise, an attorney for Ms. Foster, said that his client &quot;didn't want to prosecute Mr. Loury criminally, and we're in the process of negotiating a civil settlement.&quot;    Mr. Loury and his attorney couldn't be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
