The program, called the Second Outline Perspective Plan,will replace the New Economic Policy, or NEP, that has shapedMalaysian economic and social planning since 1970. The planwill be guided by a new emphasis on private enterprise andless on government intervention in efforts to narrowrace-based social and economic disparities among Malaysia's18 million population. Ethnic Malay mean income in 1990 wasjust 59% of ethnic Chinese income. Analysts welcomed thepragmatic, pro-business tone of the new policy.   &quot;The strongest incentive {for growth} is a healthy andliberal environment free of official harassment and red tapefor local and foreign investors to expand their businesses inthe country,&quot; Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said.   The plan projects that Malaysia will be a predominantlyindustrial economy by the turn of the century, increasinglydependent on manufactured exports to sustain growth. Themanufacturing sector is expected to grow 10.5% a year thisdecade, providing the main impetus behind projected 7%inflation-adjusted annual growth in gross domestic product.                                                                                                          MEXICO FORMS INVESTMENT BOARD                                                                                                          The Mexican government and financial institutions createdthe Mexican Investment Board to promote foreign investmentand help investors explore and pursue business in thecountry. The nonprofit organization, based in Mexico City,assumed the central investment-promotion functions previouslyperformed by government agencies. Participants include all 18commercial banks in Mexico and all 25 stockbrokerage firms.                                                                                                          EC CIVIL SERVANTS WALK OUT                                                                                                          The European Community Commission's headquarters inBrussels were deserted as civil servants staged a two-daystrike over the way their pay is determined. The walkout alsoaffected other EC institutions in Brussels and Luxembourg.Unions contend that proposals by EC member governments wouldlead to a cut in pay for some civil servants. The governmentswant to bring salaries of EC employees closer into line withthe lower levels paid to national civil servants in most ofthe 12 EC countries.                                                                                                          SWITZERLAND SEEKS AD LIMITS                                                                                                          Switzerland proposed banning tobacco advertising andlimiting ads for alcoholic beverages to newspapers andmagazines. Swiss law bars promotion of tobacco and alcohol ontelevision and radio but allows it in movie theaters, printedmedia and on billboards. The proposals wouldn't affecttobacco and alcoholic beverage companies' eventssponsorships, foreign newspapers, and European TV commercialsseen in Switzerland. A European Community proposal for a banon EC-wide tobacco ads has run into opposition.                                                                                                          NETHERLANDS' PESTICIDE USE                                                                                                          Dutch farmers, who are among the world's most intensiveusers of pesticides, must halve the amount of chemicals theyspray on their crops by the turn of the century, thegovernment said. Every year, they use 19,000 tons of activechemical ingredients -- an average of 22 pounds for every 2.5acres -- to protect crops from insects, weeds and disease.                                                                                                          GERMANY, POLAND SIGN TREATY                                                                                                          Bonn and Warsaw signed a friendship treaty. The accordsets guidelines for economic, cultural and politicalrelations. It renounces force, recognizes the post-World WarII border between Poland and united Germany, and guaranteesminority rights on both sides. Both nations' leadersemphasized that close ties could aid Poland in joining theEuropean Community. The treaty must still be ratified by bothcountries' parliaments.                                                                                                          KOREAN UNREST'S VOTING FALLOUT                                                                                                          A backlash against the violent street protests that haverocked South Korea for the past two months may help thecountry's ruling party sweep provincial assembly elections onThursday.   Despite the dissident students' demonstrations calling fora new government, analysts and diplomats predict candidatesaffiliated with President Roh Tae Woo's Democratic LiberalParty will win a majority of seats in 12 of the 15 newlyformed provincial assemblies.   The ruling party, widely unpopular, is benefiting from theprotests because they have stirred distrust of oppositionleader Kim Dae Jung among both dissidents, who are histraditional supporters, and South Korea's middle class.   Mr. Kim's show of sympathy for the students has alienatedmiddle-class voters, who were shocked by some incidents inthe demonstrations. And radical students have accused Mr. Kimof selling out because he won't call for overthrow of thegovernment.
