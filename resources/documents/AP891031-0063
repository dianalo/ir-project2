Its leadership ruled Szeto Wah and Martin Lee no longer fit toserve on the Chinese-dominated committee that is formulating theBritish colony's constitution for when it reverts to Chinesecontrol in 1997.   The Chinese lawmakers said the two can only return to thecommittee if they ``abandon their antagonistic stand against theChinese government and their attempt to nullify the Sino-Britishjoint declaration on Hong Kong,'' the official Xinhua News Agencyreported.   Britain and Hong Kong agreed in 1984 that the colony, a coastalenclave, would revert to Chinese rule in 1997.   The new constitution, known as the Basic Law, is supposed toguarantee a ``one country-two systems'' formula under which theterritory is to keep its Western capitalist system for 50 years.   With the takeover date drawing nearer, China and Hong Kong havebeen sharply at odds.   China has strongly objected to the active support that hasblossomed in Hong Kong for people involved in the Beijingpro-democracy movement that China's Communist leaders crushed onJune 4.   Hundreds of unarmed civilians were killed in the militaryattack, after which many leaders of the student-inspired movementfled into hiding and exile.   Earlier this month, China suspended repatriation of illegalChinese immigrants in Hong Kong for two weeks after the colonyallowed a world-class Chinese swimmer to seek asylum in the UnitedStates.   Residents in Hong Kong, in turn, have been worried that theChinese crackdown has demonstrated it will not honor its promisesto maintain personal freedoms and capitalism in Hong Kong.   Xinhua said the two members removed from the committee hadorganized a group called the ``Hong Kong Citizens' Federation InSupport of the Patriotic and Democratic Movement.'' It said thegroup openly advocated the overthrow of the Beijing government.   Congress noted that the two had already said they would not takepart in law-drafting work under the current Chinese government,Xinhua said. The Chinese lawmakers also said the pair had calledfor re-examination of the 1984 British-Chinese pact.   A poll published today indicated a large majority of Hong Kongresidents are skeptical about whether China will keep its promisesto Hong Kong.   Nearly 70 percent of the 600 people surveyed in the telephonepoll expressed a lack of confidence that the new constitution wouldensure that the ``one country-two systems'' promise will be kept byChina.   Just 3 percent said they were ``very confident'' the Basic Lawwould guarantee the formula.   The poll, conducted by Inrasia Pacific, was sponsored by theEnglish-language South China Morning Post.</TEXT></DOC>
