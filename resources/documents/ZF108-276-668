 DPPX/SP is a centrally managed, distributed processingsystem designed to run on the IBM 8100 family of processors.andP;  DPPX/370 is theDPPX/SP system ported to the IBM ES/9370 family of processors.andP;  The paperoutlines the strategies, the technical problems encountered and theirsolutions, customer participation, and testing.andP;  Finally, it providesrecommendations on how the process might have been improved.andM;The migration of customer systems was a major concern in the porting of theDistributed Processing Programming Executive (DPPX) operating system from theIBM 8100 to the IBM ES/9370 hardware.andP;  Moving a computer system from onehardware architecture to another is a formidable task, requiring significantcustomer investment in training, planning, and execution of the technicalchanges.andM;A key concern of 8100 customers was the ability to use their existing DPPXSystem Product (DPPX/SP) applications and databases on the new ES/9370hardware base.andP;  Further complicating the move was the existence of largenetworks of 8100s running DPP/SP.andM;A primary goal was to make the migration from DPPX/SP to DPPX/370 asstraightforward as possible with a minimum of change to end-user commands andoperator functions.andP;  This goal was essential to the success of the portedoperating system.andP;  Migration to a new version of the operating system, ratherthan conversion to a new system, implied that the customers' existing skillsand knowledge of DPPX would still be useful, minimizing the amount oftraining required.andM;The migration of existing system definitions, applications, and data alsopreserved the customers' substantial investment in a proven networkconfiguration.andP;  This allowed the customers to avoid conversion to an entirelynew hardware and software system with inherent costs in education, recodingof programs, and conversion of existing data.andM;Another major goal was to provide easy-to-use documentation of the migrationprocess.andP;  This documentation is contained in References 1 and 2.andM;The migration information had the following purposes: It had to persuade thecustomer to migrate and therefore had to be presented as a task that was notoverly difficult, it had to help customers plan their migration, and it hadto provide actual migration procedures.andM;A secondary goal was to allow DPPX/SP and DPPX/370 systems to coexist in amixed network.andP;  This was important because large networks consisting of onehundred or more DPPX/SP systems were in existence.andP;  This is a unique problemto distributed processing systems, where hundreds of systems can be in thenetwork.andP;  Thus, a customer could migrate one system at a time, verifying thesuccess of the migration, before making a commitment to migrate the entirenetwork.andP;  References 3 and 4 give a general description of DPPX distributedprocessing systems.andM;Another established goal was to migrate a production system within a weekend.andO;Although the actual time period is affected by many customer-dependentvariables, this goal served as a focus for the migration committee toidentify tasks that could be performed prior to the actual migration.andM;Migration was defined as replacing DPPX/SP systems on a one-for-one basiswith DPPX/370 systems.andP;  If a customer chose to retain an 8100 to controlcommunication devices not supported by DPPX/370, it was assumed that noapplications would remain on the 8100.andM;On the other hand, if a customer was just adding an ES/9370 to an existingDPPX/SP network and was not migrating any data or applications from an 8100to the new machine, this was considered a new installation, not a migration.andM;StrategyandM;Because of the diverse considerations that needed to be addressed in themigration, a committee was formed to analyze and define the migrationprocess.andP;  This committee was responsible for planning the migrationdocumentation.andP;  It became apparent that some information was needed for thecustomers to plan the migration, whereas other information was needed onlyduring the actual migration of the systems.andP;  Therefore, the documentation wassplit into a migration planning manual and a migration procedures manual.andO;[1,2]andM;The strategy for developing the migration information was to &quot;divided andconquer.&quot;andP;  The job was divided into logical scenarios based on the typicalcustomer environment.andP;  The scenarios described the overall migration of acustomer's DPPX network.andP;  This strategy was further refined to migrate eachDPPX system.andP;  The job was broken down further into migrating system parts,user-defined parts, and other considerations.andM;The migration committee consisted of approximately ten representatives fromall groups in the DPPX development organization.andP;  These people had differenttechnical expertise.andP;  The migration committee formed a wide knowledge base ofthe entire DPPX operating system.andP;  Of course there were some holes where nosingle member had technical expertise.andP;  Where DPPX technical expertise waslacking, it was identified, and a plan to obtain information outside thecommittee was formed.andM;Strengths and weaknesses of the strategyandM;The benefits of this strategy were twofold.andP;  (1) It allowed the paralleleffort of many people involved in gathering the information.andP;  (2) It provokedan indepth understanding of a limited part of the migration by eachinvestigator.andM;There were also multiple benefits of the migration committee approach.andP;  Theknowledge was shared among personnel from different groups, regular meetingspermitted checkpointing and tracking of progress, and many conflicting ideaswere resolved to provide a general solution.andM;The committee approach had a few weaknesses.andP;  Due to the rather large numberof representatives in the migration committee meetings, much unproductivetime was spent discussing conflicting opinions.andP;  Although a smaller migrationcommittee may have been more productive with less discussion, many migrationconcerns may then not have been addressed.andM;The information gathering was done at the same time as program development.andO;This resulted in conflicting demands on technical experts' time.andP;  Thebenefits of shared knowledge and early availability of migration informationmore than offset this weakness.andM;The people available to participate lacked a broad customer background.andP;  Thisweakness was offset by people who were very technically knowledgeable.andO;Acquiring more customer knowledge from outside the migration committee wasrecognized as a problem that needed to be addressed.andM;TasksandM;The migration committee decided to break down the large migration job to atask level.andP;  This allowed the work to be distributed and helped ensure thatall possible items were handled.andM;The tasks evolved into a list of about a hundred work items.andP;  These workitems were then distributed among the members of the migration committee.andP;  Astandard format for documenting the information was developed, and theresponsible committee members had the job of finding the correct technicalperson to document the task.andP;  They also had to gather a list of all the IBMcustomized DPPX/SP elements for the component being worked on.andP;  Thesecustomized elements were shipped with the DPPX/SP product and could bemodified by the customer.andP;  Then the committee member had to present thefindings to the rest of the committee to critique.andM;Once the task was documented, it was placed in a migration task file.andP;  Thisfile was the source of information for the migration manuals which werewritten after all the task documentation was complete.andP;  [1,2]  Because themigration data placed in the task file were totally unorganized, the writersof the manuals encountered problems using the information.andM;The problems encountered.andP;  A number of problems were encountered.andP;  The mostsignificant ones are discussed.andM;Organization of tasks.andP;  The biggest problem was the lack of organization ofthe migration tasks.andP;  Migration had numerous discrete tasks, but they did notfit together into a process the customer could follow.andP;  Not only was overallorganization lacking, but each of the tasks contained planning and proceduralsections that needed to be ordered chronologically.andP;  Some tasks, such asordering hardware, had to be done in advance.andP;  Other tasks, such as movinguser data to the ES/9370, were done at the actual time of migration.andM;This problem was solved by dividing the tasks into planning tasks andprocedural tasks.andP;  The planning tasks were those that could be done inadvance before the customer installed the product.andP;  The procedural tasks werethose the customer did at the actual time of migration.andP;  Tasks were furtherorganized by subdividing by the type of user who would complete them.andP;  Thisorganization provided the committee with hardware, data, and applicationmigration tasks.andP;  This organization of tasks was then verified by iterativedocumentation reviews and testing.andM;Hierarchy of importance.andP;  It was not clear which tasks were important andwould have to be done by all customers, and which were so obscure that no onewould ever attempt them.andP;  This problem was solved through customer feedbackduring a joint study, described later, and system test of DPPX/370.andM;Audience definition.andP;  The migration committee was not sure who would beperforming the tasks.andP;  Some very detailed tasks descriptions would beperformed by an operator, whereas other tasks involved an indepth knowledgeof the most complex areas of the DPPX operating system.andP;  Some tasks requireda hardware expert to perform them, others an application programmer.andM;The tools that were being developed also reflected this problem.andP;  Migrator,the automated tool for migrating system elements and user data, wasoriginally designed so that it could be used by someone at the operatorlevel.andP;  The worksheets that were to be used by the persons operatingMigrator, however, required an in-depth knowledge of the system.andP;  Obviously,it was not known who would be using the migrator.andM;This problem was solved by getting to know who the migrating customers were.andO;Findings were validated by conducting usability tests with the documentationand the code, using appropriate test subjects.andM;Network migrationandM;DPPX is an operating system for centrally managed distributed processing.andO;The characteristic environment of DPPX customers is a network with threetypes of systems.andM;1.andP;  An application development system, where customer applications arewritten and testedandM;2.andP;  A model production system, which contains application programs, data, andother items that are common to all the production systems in the networkandM;3.andP;  Production systems, which are copies of the model system, customized fora particular production site (where end users execute the applications)andM;Scenarios were developed to describe the process for migrating a typicalnetwork, with actions depending on the type of system being migrated.andP;  Figure1 shows the creation of amodel system at the central site, the model systembeing dumped to take, the system being restored at the remote site, and thenthe migration of unique data at the remote DPPX location.andP;  It was found thatthe migration of an entire network would be a gradual process.andP;  Figure 2shows that over a time period of a few years some customers would have bothDPPX/SP and DPPX/370 systems in the network.andM;Technical problems and solutionsandM;Migrating 8100 hardware connections to ES/9370andM;The hardware supported by the 8100 could not be fully supported by theES/9370 hardware.andP;  On the other hand, many communication connectionssupported by the 8100 hardware could be reconnected to the ES/9370 hardwarewith little or no hardware changes.andP;  Some minor differences between the 8100and ES/9370 hardware required changes in cable lengths and hardwareconnectors.andM;8100 loop devices.andP;  The biggest problem for connectivity was migrating 8100loop devices connected to the 8100 over to the ES/9370.andP;  The ES/9370 did notsupport the 8100 loop.andP;  Customers of the 8100 had hundreds of displayterminals and hundreds of manufacturing terminals that could only beconnected to the 8100 communication loop.andP;  The DPPX design department lookedextensively for a method to support 8100 loop devices connected to theES/9370.andM;One of the possible solutions investigated was a remote 8100 loop connectedto a PC, where the PC was attached by Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC) tothe ES/9370.andP;  Since the final customer price for this hardware and softwarewas too high to be useful for the customers, the final solution for 8100 loopsupport was to retain the 8100 to be used as a controller.andM;8100 retained as a controller to support 8100 loop devices.andP;  The ES/9370supported a SDLC peer link, as shown in Figure 3.andP;  The 8100 and ES/9370 couldbe peer-connected by this communication link with a data rate of 56 000 bitsper second.andP;  Through the use of Router, which is software that is part ofboth DPPX/SP and DPPX/370, 8100 loop devices could communicate with DPPX/370applications across the 8100 to ES/9370 peer link.andP;  No new code needed to bedevelopment, since this was existing function currently supported by therouter in both DPPX/SP and DPPX/370.andP;  Figure 3 shows a DPPX/370 applicationcommunicating with devices connected to the 8100 through the router.andM;Sample DPPX/370 configurations.andP;  When replacing an 8100 with an ES/9370, thecustomer could elect to keep the 8100 and use it as a controller.andP;  Thefollowing sample configurations show this option and other options availablefor hardware migration.andM;DPPX/SP configuration before migration.andP;  Figure 4 shows to DPPX/SP systemsbefore migration.andP;  Both systems use an 8100 loop and have SDLC data linksconnected to a communication controller (3174 or 3274) or PC, where multipledisplay terminals can be connected to the communication controller.andP;  System Bhas manufacturing terminals (364x) and a display terminal (8775) connected toan 8100 loop.andP;  DPPX/370 configuration after migration.andP;  Figure 5 shows thetwo systems after migration.andP;  DPPX/SP systems A and B are replaced withDPPX/370 systems.andP;  One of the 8100s is kept as a controller and ispeer-connected to the DPPX/370 system B.andP;  All applications running on theDPPX/SP systems are moved to DPPX/370 systems A and B.andP;  The communicationcontrollers and PCs that were connected to DPPX/SP system A's 8100 loops arereplaced with communication controllers and PCs connected to a token ring.andO;Devices attached to the old communication controlers are reconnected to thenew controllers.andP;  System A's SDLC data links are moved from the 8100 to theES/9370.andM;The devices connected to the communication controllers on system B areremoved and reconnected to the DPPX/370 system B Work Station Controller(WSC).andP;  System B's loop wire remains connected to the 8100 retained tosupport the manufacturing terminals and loop-attached display terminals.andO;Devices connected to the 8100 loop wire communicate with applications onDPPX/370 through the router software.andM;DPPX/370 configuration using token ring.andP;  Figure 6 shows another example ofthe same DPPX/SP systems in Figure 5 after migration to DPPX/370.andP;  In thisexample, the token ring peer-connects the ES/9370s and connects some of thecontrollers and PCs.andM;It is possible to upgrade the current PCs so that they can connect to a tokenring.andP;  The customer would have to replace loop and SDLC communicationcontrollers with models that support token ring.andP;  It was not necessary torewire the devices attached to the controllers that could connect directlyinto the IBM token-ring controllers.andM;Other hardware migration concerns.andP;  Many other small hardware migrationplanning concerns were documented to make the migration document complete.andO;Making the customer aware of even some of the smallest hardware concernsduring the planning phase made the migration procedural phase go rapidly.andO;Following is a list of some of the hardware migration concerns that weredocumented:andM;* If the 8100 would have to be in operation at the same time as the ES/9370for some small migration time period (for example, for two days on a week-enduntil migration could be completed), both electrical power and floor spacewould have to be made available to accommodate both the 8100 and es/9370.andM;* Communication protocol differences and support were documented between the8100 and ES/9370.andP;  In some cases, a modern to supply clocking was added tothe communication line for ES/9370s.andM;* Cable differences were documented.andP;  Some of the ES/9370 cable lengths wereshorter than those supported by the 8100.andM;* Sometimes the hardware that was required after migration would determinewhich data transmission method was chosen for migrating data.andM;Another hard concern for customers who decided to retin in 8100 as acontroller was the response time for 8100-connected devices communicatingwith applications running on the ES/9370 through the router.andP;  A programcalled the Performance Advisor was written that would run on a personalcomputer to assist the customer in planning the response time.andP;  Given variouscurrent 8100 conditions and response times, the Performance Advisor woulddetermine what the response time would be using the 8100 as a controller.andM;Migrating dataandM;To migrate data from the 8100 to the ES/9370, different data transmissionmethods were made available.andP;  The different methods had different hardwarerequirements and different performance rates.andP;  Below is a list of the datatransmission methods from best to worst performance.andM;1.andP;  Stand-alone DASD dump/restore (SADDR) used reel-to-reel tape to dump anentire DASD volume on the 8100 and then to restore this volume from tape toan ES/9370 DASD volume.andP;  Tape drives on both the 8100 and ES/9370 wererequired.andM;2.andP;  Peer Data Transfer (PDT) could be used to migrate data from an 8100 thatwas peer-connected to an ES/9370.andP;  This method was very convenient forsystems where the 8100 was going to be retained and used as a controller tosupport 8100 communication devices that are no longer supported by DPPX/370.andO;This could be done over 56 000, 19 200, or 9600 bit-per-second communicationlines.andM;3.andP;  Distributed Systems Executive (DSX) or NetView[TM] Distribution Manager(NetView DM) could be used to transport data from an 8100 to a large centralsite host System/370 and then back to an ES/9370 system.andP;  This was done over9600 bit-per-second communication lines.andM;The migration tool, Migrator, which presented data set selection screenpanels, was designed to migrate data.andP;  It allowed the selected of 8100 datasets for migration.andP;  It made it easier to select data sets and provided thefollowing functions:andM;* Data set filtering.andP;  Migrator filtered out IBM data sets that should not bemigrated.andM;* Customized data sets.andP;  Migrator provided a list of IBM data sets that mayhave been used to customized DPPX/SP, which could be selected for migrationin order to retain the same customization on DPPX/370.andM;* Specific programs generated.andP;  Migrator generated programs specific to thedata transmission method selected.andP;  These programs would migrate the dataselected when invoked on the DPPX/370 system.andM;Another very important requirement for data transmission was the ability tomigrate all unique data at a production site within 30 hours-- that is,within a weekend--so that users would not experience any down time.andM;DPPX/SP and DPPX/370 are highly distributed operating systems with usuallyone application development site and as many as a hundred production sites.andO;All production sites usually run the same set of applications.andP;  Eachproduction site is different only by its application data and communicationdevices.andP;  To migrate each production site, a model DPPX/370 system for allproduction systems would be built at the application development site.andP;  Thismodel system, including the customized operating system, would be dumped totape and then restored from tape on each production system's ES/9370 DASD.andO;Then the production site unique application data could be migrated from the8100 to the ES/9370 within this 30-hour window.andM;Migrating applicationsandM;Figure 7 summarizes the way each type of application is migrated to DPPX/370.andM;Migrating COBOL applications.andP;  Migrating COBOL applications proved to be thebiggest effort in application migration.andP;  Considerations included:andM;* Source code imcompatibilities between DPPX 8100 COBOL and DPPX/370 COBOL IIandM;* Additional reserved wordsandM;* Whether the applications would exist in a mixed network of 8100s and 9370sandM;* Where the source would be keptandM;* what publications would be usedandM;* Arithmetic precisionandM;* Storage requirementsandM;The preprocessor.andP;  There are two equivalent preprocessors, one for DPPX/370and one for MVS.andP;  The choice of preprocessor depends on where the source willbe compiled.andP;  The COBOL II preprocessor is a licensed program used to adjust8100 DPPX COBOL source code for either COBOL II compilation.andM;The COBOL programs need to be run through the COBOL II preprocessor beforerecompiling the under COBOL II.andP;  The COBOL II preprocessor has two mainfunctions: (1) It handles DPPX language incompatibilities by converting thestatements (which run on the 8100) into acceptable COBOL II statements thatwill run on the DPPX/370 system.andP;  These conversions are necessary because ofthe differences between 8100 DPPX COBOL and COBOL II.andP;  (Some of thestatements have different syntax requirements.)andP;  (2) It handlesDPPX/370-unique I/O extensions not supported by COBOL II.andM;It was decided that DPPX/370 would support COBOL II, not DPPX 8100 COBOL.andO;This decision made the COBOL programs meet the industry standard.andM;Customers had two main decisions to make in their migration.andP;  (1) Decidewhere to maintain the COBOL source.andP;  It could be kept on the DPPX/370 or atthe host MVS system.andP;  During the network migration time, when operating amixed network, the customer may have decided to keep source on DPPX/SP.andP;  (2)Decide which compiler to use--the DPPX/370 COBOL II compiler or the VS COBOLII, Release 1.2, compiler on MVS.andP;  This depended on where the customer wasgoing to develop applications and maintain the source.andM;The migration process of COBOL compiler and applications.andP;  The customerneeded to recompile the prepocessed COBOL applications before they could beused.andP;  They could be recompiled on MVS with the VS COBOL II, Release 1.2,compiler, or on DPPX/370 with the DPPX/370 COBOL II compiler.andM;Customers had to decide where they would develop their applications and wherethey are going to maintain their source.andP;  The answers to these questionsdecided which preprocessor and COBOL compiler the customer would use.andP;  Figure8 shows the relationship between the compilers.andM;The following is an overview of how COBOL applications were migrated.andM;1.andP;  Preprocess on MVS or DPPX/370.andM;2.andP;  Compile on MVS or DPPX/370.andM;3.andP;  Link-edit the text deck on DPPX/370.andM;4.andP;  Run the program.andM;The assembler.andP;  DPPX assembler programs could not run on DPPX/370, sinceassembler language is directly associated with the architecture of theprocessor.andP;  The customer had to rewrite DPPX/SP assembler programs forDPPX/370 by using a language supported by DPPX/370 or by using Assembler H onMVS.andP;  DPPX macros for use with Assembler H were developed.andM;The customer had to decide which DPPX/SP assembler programs were required onDPPX/370 and then decide which language to use to rewrite those assemblerprograms.andP;  The customer also had to estimate the rewriting effort.andM;Data managementandM;Figure 9 shows the different methods of data migration.andM;Catalog reformatting.andP;  In order to support larger DASD devices, the catalogstructure changed in DPPX/370.andP;  Migrated catalogs needed to be reformattedbefore DPPX/370 would allow read/write access to the catalog.andP;  Read access toa DPPX/SP format catalog was allowed in order to permit the copying of dataout of the catalog when the entire catalog was not needed.andM;Logical volumes.andP;  In order to move data from a DPPX/SP system residencevolume to a DPPX/370 system residence volume, two discks with the same volumeserial needed to be active at the same time.andP;  The logical volume functionallowed the activation of the DPPX/SP system residence volume with atemporary name, allowing the copying of data from one disk to another.andM;Change in logical block size.andP;  Due to the change in the disk physical blocksize from 256 to 512 bytes, the default logical block size for data sets waschanged to 512 bytes on DPPX/370.andP;  DPPX/370 maintained the externalinterfaces allowing 256-byte logical blocks.andP;  However, the sytem had totranslate disk I/O requests into 512-byte requests, causing a performancedegradation.andM;To help customers find data set definitions that should be reblocked, a toolwas written to log those definitions that have the logical block lengthdefaulted or specified as a nonmultiple of 512 bytes.andM;Multivolume user catalogs.andP;  DPPX/SP required that a user catalog resideentirely on one disk volume.andP;  Because the ES/9370 disks hold much more datathan 8100 disks and the ES/9370 CPU is more powerful, the performance of thesystem was expected to be limited by the contention for disk I/O access.andM;To help alleviate this contention, multivolume user catalogs were designed tohelp balance the I/O accesses across multiple disk volumes.andP;  This is done byallowing the definition of catalogs (and thus large databases) spanning thedata across more than one disk.andM;Migration toolsandM;Some of the software tools used for migration were written to run on an 8100under DPPX/SP Release 3 or Release 4.andP;  Other migration tools were shippedwith DPPX/370 and run on an ES/9370 system.andM;The following is a list of the migration tools that were written to run on an8100:andM;* The LIST.CONNECT command lists outstanding connections to disk data sets.andO;This command is used to find 8100 data sets that were marked connected foroutput.andP;  Any data set marked connected for output could not be connected to,which would result in not being able to read the data set.andP;  Therefore thesedata sets could not be migrated.andM;* Migrator generates DPPX/370 commands that would be run on the DPPX/370system to migrate data from DPPS/SP to DPPX/370.andP;  The user was presentedlists of DPPX/SP systems data sets that may have been changed or customizedby the customer.andP;  Data sets that had been modified could be selected formigration.andP;  Lists of user data sets could also be selected.andM;* Peer Data Transfer (PDT) provides commands that transfer data sets andcatalogs from DPPX/SP to a DPPX/370 over a peer link between an 8100 and anES/9370 system.andM;The following tools were shipped with the DPPX/370 system and run on theDPPX/370 system:andM;* The LIST.CONNECT command lists outstanding connections to disk data sets.andM;* The MIGRATE.DATA command runs commands generated by the migrator to migratedata from DPPX/SP to DPPX/370.andM;* Peer Data Transfer (PDT) provides commands to transfer data sets andcatalogs from DPPX/SP to a DPPX/370 over a peer link between an 8100 and anES/9370 system.andM;* Stand-alone DASD dump/restore (SADDR) lets the customer restore an 8100SADDR-dumped DASD volume onto an ES/9370 DASD using magnetic tape as thetransfer medium.andP;  However DPPX/370 could then provide only read access tothese data sets that were in catalogs with a DPPX/SP format.andP;  To obtainread/write access to the migrated data, either data sets had to be copied toanother catalog that had been defined and created by DPPX/370 or the DPPX/SPformatted catalogs had to be converted to DPPX/370 format.andM;* The REDEFINE.andP;  CATALOG command provided the subcommand MIGRATE, which wouldconvert volume catalogs and user catalogs that were migrated to an ES/9370DASD by means of SADDR.andP;  The volume catalogs and user catalogs had to beconverted from DPPX/SP format to DPPX/370 to enable read/write access to thedata sets in the catalogs.andM;Managing a mixed network of 8100s and ES/9370s.andP;  ES/9370 systems can operatein a mixed network.andP;  The mixed network can consist of any mixture of ES/9370systems and 8100 systems.andP;  Any of the two systems can use Distributed SystemExecutive (DSX) or NetView Distribution Manager (NetView DM) to transmit datathroughout the network.andM;8100 systems are typically multidropped from the host, often on linecontaining other host-attached terminals.andP;  The ES/9370 system is attached tothe host link either multidropped or through the IBM local area network tokenring.andP;  An 8100 system can retain its own downstream networks.andP;  An 8100 can bepeer-connected to an ES/9370 system.andM;Application development in a mixed network.andP;  The DPPX/SP applicationdevelopment process would have to be maintained as long as the customer wasdeveloping and maintaining DPPX/SP applications.andP;  The application developmentprocess would be needed for applying IBM service and for making updates toDPPX/SP applications on DPPX/SP.andM;The production test system in a mixed network.andP;  The DPPX/SP production testsystem would have to continue as the test system for both DPPX/SP IBM serviceand user application updates.andP;  The system would need to:andM;* Maintain IBM components: A DPPX/370 system would be required to install IBMDPPX/370 software maintenance.andP;  A DPPX/SP system to install IBM DPPX/SPsoftware maintenance would also be required.andP;  Once the service is installed,the updates can be distributed to the other systems in the mixed network.andM;* Text and maintain user applications:  As long as DPPX/SP applications hadto be maintained, one DPPX/SP test system is required.andM;Customer participationandM;The difficulties that were encountered because of the uniqueness of theeffort to migrate an operating system from one hardware to another may besummarized as follows:andM;*Documenting a process, not the codeandM;* Inability to validate information until the process was completedandM;* Unsure of the processandM;* Lack of audience definitionandM;* No expertise in key areasandM;* No clear idea of what the customer requiredandM;The joint studyandM;The migration committee, though very knowledgeable about DPPX, was not asknowledgeable about customer usage of DPPX/SP systems.andP;  For this migration,it was necessary to obtain customer assistance to validate the proposedmigration process.andM;During the joint study and customer meeting, it became apparent that most ofthe migration concerns of the migration committee were the same as those ofthe customer.andP;  It was also apparent that some concerns the migrationcommittee thought would be enormous migration problems would not affect thecustomer at all.andM;An unfounded concern, for example, was the amount of time it would take acustomer to migrate a network of DPPX/SP systems to DPPX/370.andP;  Originally itwas thought that once a customer decided to migrate to DPPX/370, themigration of a large network of hundreds of DPPX/SP systems would becompleted in approximately six months.andP;  Therefore, the customer would nothave to be concerned with maintaining and updating DPPX/SP applications atthe same time as DPPX/370 applications were enhanced.andP;  Also the customerapplication and test DPPX/SP systems could be removed one the last DPPX/SP8100 system was migrated to DPPX/370.andP;  What was learned during the jointstudy, however, was that customers could not possible migrate a completenetwork within six months.andP;  The migration committe assumed that applicationdevelopment would be suspended during migration in a effort to complete themigration as soon as possible.andP;  In fact, a customer's requirement forapplication enhancements in the near future meant that applicationdevelopment work could not be suspended.andM;Two joint study customers agreed to receive code and documentationandgt; six otherjoint study customers received just documentation.andM;Feedbak from joint study customers.andP;  The customers in the joint studyprovided the migration committee with written critiques of the two migrationmanuals.andP;  These critiques included comments about errors, missing orextraneous information, specific requirements for a customer, or complaintsabout the migration.andM;The customers also provided feedback on code and documentation on a regularbasis.andP;  This was due through a formal procedure identical to the way realproblems raised during system test are dealt with by the DPPX developmentgroup.andP;  That is, problems were divided by category, assigned to a particulardeveloper, answered, and closed.andP;  This provided a formal process for trackingproblems arising during the joint study, many of which were specific to aparticular customer.andP;  These were separated from other problems coming in.andM;The walkthroughsandM;Starting out.andP;  The migration committee decided to hold several migrationwalkthroughs.andP;  There were different ideas on what a walkthrough should be.andO;These included:andM;* An inspection of the existing migration documentationandM;* A paper exercise using the existing documentation and a sample systemandM;* Presentations by the various technical developers in the migration effortandM;* An exercise where the attendees actually migrate a systemandM;All the different approaches had advantages and disadvantages.andP;  The presentlevel of the system and of the documentation was a factor which needed to beconsidered.andM;The internal walkthrough.andP;  The internal walkthrough consisted of half-daysessions for one week attended by program developers and other technicalexperts.andP;  The format was series of presentations on technical migrationtopics, with manuals distributed on the first day of the walkthrough.andP;  It wasexpected that the attendees would read through the information during theweek.andM;Getting the IBM system engineers involved.andP;  It was decided to have somesystems engineers (SEs) join the migration committee for a walkthrough.andP;  EachDPPX/SP customer is assigned at least one IBM SE who becomes veryknowledgeable about the assigned customer system.andP;  SE input on the proposedmigration process enhanced the knowledge of the migration committeeconcerning the customer requirements.andM;This walkthrough evolved into a question-and-answer session with the SEsforming a panel to represent their customer's point of view.andP;  The walkthroughprovided source material, helped define the audience for migration, andprovided customer migration scenarios.andM;Actual customers.andP;  Two months after the SE walkthrough, a walkthrough washeld with the joint study customers who were to receive code.andP;  A week wasdevoted to each walkthrough and each presentation focused on the key concernsfor each customer.andP;  The customer also provided the migration committee withearly feedback on the drafts of the migration manuals.andM;Vended system testandM;Because of the lack of resources, lack of actual customer environments, anddesire for customer feedback, DPPX/370 development managers decided tocontract a customer to do the job of testing an actual customer migration.andO;In order to simulate an actual customer migration as much as possible, thiscustomer did not receive any formal education about DPPX/370 as did the jointstudy customers.andP;  This customer was provided migration manuals only.andM;What was learnedandM;The migration committee did not have a clear view of what migrating customerswanted.andP;  Many thought that customers would find this the ideal time torecustomize their systems.andP;  The committee learned that the average customerjust wanted to have the system exactly as it was before migration, withminimal disruption of normal day-to-day operations.andM;Another area of the committee's attention was the migration of customized IBMelements.andP;  It was thought that the customer would consider this critical totheir migration effort.andP;  In reality, the major concern of most customers wasthe migration of their application programs, specifically the migration oftheir COBOL programs.andM;An area of dissension among the members of the committee was the length ofmigration.andP;  Some saw it as a quick one-for-one replacementandgt; others saw it asa gradual process that would take years.andP;  In actuality, both were right.andO;Some customers with a small number of 8100s intalled would have a very shortmigrationandgt; other customers with a large number of 8100s intalled or largenumber of applications would take years to migrate all the 8100s to ES/9370s.andM;The committee thought the person doing the actual migration would be anoperator.andP;  The original draft of DPPX/370 Migration: Procedures [2] waswritten with this audience in mind.andP;  It turned out, however, after workingwith and talking with the customers, that the personnel responsible for thiscritical migration task would be very knowledgeable about DPPX and about thespecific customer system being migrated.andM;Outcome of customer involvementandM;The early involvement of customers in the migration from DPPX/SP to DPPX/370helped in the following ways:andM;* It provided source material.andM;* It defined who the migrating audience would be.andM;* It validated the completeness and usability of information in books.andM;* It defined the scope of information.andM;* It tested the code and documentation.andM;* It helped focus on key issues.andM;* It settled development disputes.andM;Testing migrationandM;To test the migration, actual customer DPPX/SP applications were obtainedwith customer permission.andP;  The applications included the executable DPPX/SPmodules, the databases, and the COBOL source code.andP;  Two of the customerapplications were installed on 8100s in the DPPX development lab very earlyin the component test phase of DPPX/370.andM;The customer application systems were IPLed on the 8100.andP;  The first step wasto recompile all the customer's 8100 COBOL source to determine if the sourcecode would compile successfully on the 8100.andP;  After verifying that the sourcecode could be compiled successfully, the customer application was tested onthe 8100 to verify that it could be executed.andM;COBOL source code was sent through the COBOL II preprocessor and thencompiled under DPPX/370 COBOL II.andP;  Various errors were found in using the newDPPX/370 COBOL II compiler, and diffrences were found between the twocompilers that required some minor changes to the application source code.andO;These diffrences were then documented in the migration manuals.andM;After the differences were resolved and successful DPPX/370 COBOL IIcompilations obtained, the user data sets and modified DPPX system data setswere migrated from the 8100 to the ES/9370 system.andP;  The user application onthe DPPX/370 system was tested for more differences between the compilers.andO;These differences were either fixed in the COBOL preprocessor or COBOL IIcompiler.andP;  The application was now running on the DPPX/370.andP;  During thisperiod, errors in DPPX/370 were found and corrected.andM;Different customer COBOL applications were written using different COBOLfunctions and programming styles.andP;  Each customer had a set of COBOLapplications that stressed certain functions of the compiler more than othercustomer applications.andP;  After it was determined that each customer haddifferent programming styles, a decision was made to recompile as muchcustomer DPPX/SP COBOL source code as possible.andM;After finishing a basic migration for two customers, the next step was totest everything that was required for a customer to perform a migration.andO;Testing an actual migration involved:andM;* Testing migration planning documentationandM;* Testing migration procedure documentationandM;* Testing such migration tools as SADDR and PDT, which migrated customer dataandM;Testing the migration planning documentation was very difficult.andP;  It wasgiven to non-IBM contractors to use during their migration testing.andP;  Also,DPPX/370 developers were assigned to migrate various customer applicationsusing these manuals.andP;  Many comments were received from both sources.andO;Varification of the planning document for completeness was heavily dependenton the customer responses to questions received in the very early part of themigration development phase.andM;To test the migration procedures document and migration tools, various groupswere given the task of reading DPPX/370 Migration: Procedures and migrating acustomer's DPPX/SP system to a DPPX/370 system.andP;  Since this was an iterativeprocess of migrating and improving both the documentation and fixing errorsin the tools, certain customer applications were migrated many times usingdifferent testing groups each time.andP;  Also, parts of the customer's DPPX/SPsystem were migrated using different data transmission methods.andM;After months of testing, improving the migration documentation, fixingmigration tools, and then retesting, the migration tests were almostcomplete.andP;  The duration of time to migrate data from the 8100 to an ES/9370had to be obtained for each of the data transmission methods.andP;  Thedocumentation for time to migrate data had to provide sufficient informationto give a good perfomance comparison between the different data transmissionmethods and sufficient information to enable the customer to estimate abouthow long it would take a migrate their data.andM;Conclusions and recommendationsandM;The use of a committee was necessary, due to the size of the effort and theinformation needed from many sources.andP;  The migration committee could focus onthe problems of migration, while talking to many other people in order togather technical information, understand customer requirements, and solveproblems.andM;The migration work effort was done in parallel with the development andtesting of DPPX/370.andP;  Also, the impact the migration committe had ondevelopment of the DPPX/370 product was minimal.andP;  Therefore, the migrationwork did not affect the scheduled general availability date of DPPX/370.andM;The division of the effort into major tasks, and the iterative breakdown ofeach task, allowed steady, measurable progress.andP;  Once the scope of a task wasbroken down to an understandable level, that piece could be researched anddocumented.andP;  This eventually was structured into documentation and tools thatled the customer through a difficult problem in a straightforward manner.andM;The fundamental goal of a straightforward migration with minimal change toend-user and operator externals was maintained throughout the project.andO;However, other goals changed over time.andP;  Some goals changed due to customerfeedbackandgt; other were changed due to the discovery of technical problems.andP;  Thebreadth of knowledge of the migration committee was essential for handlingthese changing goals.andM;While this approach was basically sound, some recommendations for possibleimprovements are listed below:andM;* Customers should be involved as early as possible.andP;  Feedback from customerscan point out bad assumptions, key requirements, and areas for improvement.andM;* The migration work shall be the key responsibility of the committeemembers.andP;  Although the importance of the project was recognized, otherresponsibilities were often given higher priority, causing undue delays.andM;* Hardware personnel should be involved.andP;  The lack of communication betweenthe software and hardware organizations caused problems to be discovered latein the project schedule.andM;Had these recommendations been followed, a better quality set of infomationand tools would have been available at an earlier time.andM;The migration methodology used was a sound approach to the gathering andverification of vast amounts of information necessary to lead the DPPX/SPcustomers through a DPPX migration from an 8100 to ES/9370.andM;AcknowledgementsandM;It is not possible to list all the people who contributed to migratingcustomer applications.andP;
