Information Minister Stoffel van der Merwe made the comments onstate-run television's evening newscast.   ``The government is considering thoroughly all aspects of thesecurity system in the country in order to decide whether theemergency should be reimposed or not,'' he said.   ``The fact that things are fairly normal, there are not so manypeople dying in these days, is not necessarily a full conclusionthat we don't need security arrangements.''   Although van der Merwe made no promises, it appeared significantthat the issue of lifting the emergency was the first itemmentioned on the evening news.   Van der Merwe has said in the past that when the governmentwants to make a significant policy change, it prepares the publicfor it by opening discussion on the issue.   President P.W. Botha declared the national emergency on June 12,1986, saying regular laws were insufficient to deal with widespreadviolence in black townships, protest rallies and unrest against thegovernment's apartheid laws.   Under apartheid, the black majority of 28 million has no say innational affairs, and the 5 million whites control the economy andhave separate housing districts and schools.   Botha's decrees under the emergency allow police nearlyunrestricted power to detain people indefinitely without charge,close newspapers, ban meetings, rallies and church services, andoutlaw organizations.   Individuals also may be prohibited from speaking in public, andcriticism against the government, police and the army can be banned.   Monitoring groups say at least 30,000 people were detainedwithout charge under the emergency. Hundreds were freed following ahunger strike among detainees earlier this year, and an estimated50 people still are being held.   Van der Mewe said the government could soften some criticism bylifting the state of emergency, which has been condemned bygovernments and human rights organizations around the world.   But, he said, ``You cannot afford to let society lapse intodisorder again in order just to avoid criticism.''  </TEXT></DOC>
