The victim, U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, was on U.N.duty when he was abducted.   Shiite sources said they expected kidnappers threatening thelife of Joseph Cicippio, 58, of Norristown, Pa., to spare him atIran's behest to avert a confrontation with the United States.   Pro-Iranian kidnappers said they hanged Higgins on Monday inretaliation for Israel's abduction Friday of a Lebanese Shiitecleric. The colonel was seized Feb. 17, 1988, near Tyre in southLebanon.   The Vatican said Pope John Paul II, at President Bush's request,would assist in efforts to have Higgins' body returned to theUnited States.   Bush said Wednesday he is ``leaving no stone unturned'' intrying to free American hostages but lacks hard information as hetries to deal with the crisis ``in a prudent way.''   He said he contacted many world leaders and ``We have hadassurance after assurance ... they want to help.''   British officials in London said Bush and Prime MinisterMargaret Thatcher talked for 20 minutes about the crisis.   A videotape the kidnappers provided shows a man, apparentlyHiggins, hanging from a gallows. No body has been found and thereis no way of knowing when the tape was made. Some reports have saidHiggins was killed months ago.   Pentagon officials said the USS Belknap, flagship of the U.S.6th Fleet, and the fleet commander canceled a visit to Sevastopolin the Soviet Union in case Bush needs them, but said a militarystrike was unlikely. The aircraft carrier America cut short a visitto Singapore, they said.   Marrack Goulding, U.N. undersecretary-general for peacekeepingoperations, flew to U.N. headquarters in the Lebanese border townof Naqoura by helicopter from Israel.   He met with Maj. Gen. Lars-Eric Wahlgren, Swedish commander ofthe U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon, and battalion commanders of thenine-nation force known as UNIFIL to investigate Higgins' death andtry to find his body.   UNIFIL spokesman Timor Goksel said Goulding put off going toBeirut because of the fighting but would try to make the tripThursday. Christian forces and a Syrian-led Moslem alliance havefought an artillery war in Beirut for five months.   The undersecretary-general is scheduled to meet with Lebaneseleaders in Beirut, but Goksel would not identify them.   ``There are no negotiations involved, although he has asecondary mission of trying to find out about other hostages inLebanon,'' the spokesman said.   Sixteen Westerners are captives in Lebanon, including eightAmericans. Held longest is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent of The Associated Press, kidnapped March 16, 1985.   Higgins, 44, commanded a 75-man observer team attached to the5,800-member UNIFIL force.   Cicippio's captors, who call themselves the RevolutionaryJustice Organization, said Monday he would be killed unless Israelfreed Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid by 6 p.m. the next day.   Two hours after the Tuesday deadline, the kidnappers announced a``non-extendable postponement'' of 48 hours. No specific hour onThursday was mentioned as a new deadline.   The statement cited a plea for mercy from Cicippio's Lebanesewife, Elham, and other ``friendly appeals and sincere behests.''   Mrs. Cicippio said Wednesday: ``Even if it was a postponementfor only one minute, it's better than nothing.''   Shiite sources said Iran might have stepped in to save Cicippiobecause of the international uproar created by Higgins' death.   An organization caling itself the Organization of the Oppressedon Earth claimed to hold Higgins.   Nearly all the groups holding hostages are believed to be frontsfor Hezbollah, or Party of God, a Shiite movement in which Obeid isa spiritual leader.   Israel has offered to exchange Obeid and other Shiite prisonersfor the foreign hostages and three of its soldiers held prisoner inLebanon, but Hezbollah rejected the deal.   Moshe Arens, the Israeli foreign minister, said Wednesday therewas a ``good possibility'' hostages would be freed, but otherofficials said negotiations could be lengthy.   Iran sponsors Hezbollah, which also holds two of the threeIsraeli soldiers.   Israeli commandos abducted Obeid, 33, and two aides from hishome in Jibchit, a south Lebanon village.   Hezbollah denies any connection with the hostages, but publiclyendorsed the Oppressed on Earth group when it claimedresponsibility for Higgins' abduction.   One Lebanese Shiite source said: ``The Iranians probably arebringing immense pressure on their Lebanese surrogates, seeking todefuse the crisis generated by Higgins' murder. They can do withouta showdown with the United States.''   Hashemi Rafsanjani, just elected president of Iran, has soughtimproved relations with the West in the past in hopes of aid inrebuilding from eight years of war with Iraq.   Other Shiite sources said the emergence of Rafsanjani as Iran'smost powerful politician had meant a decline in the influence overHezbollah of a hard-line rival, Interior Minister Ali AkbarMohtashemi.   Analysts say the hostages' fate may be dictated by the strugglebetween those known as pragmatists, led by Rafsanjani, andhard-liners over the direction of Iran's 10-year-old Islamicrevolution.   The first Shiite source noted that Revolutionary Justice is notknown to have killed a hostage, but has issued death threats in thepast.   The Revolutionary Justice statement announcing the 48-hourpostponement for Cicippio was accompanied by a picture of anotherAmerican hostage it holds, writer Edward Austin Tracy, 58.   Statements from the group threatened both men's lives twice in1988.   Cicippio was acting comptroller of the American University ofBeirut when he was abducted from its campus on Sept. 12, 1986.</TEXT></DOC>
