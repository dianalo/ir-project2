Herbert Lanese, chief financial officer of the St. Louisaerospace concern, said the three-year agreement wouldreplace a one-year, $750 million credit facility that expiresin December. He said the longer-term arrangement wassignificant because some on Wall Street, and thecredit-rating agencies, had questioned McDonnell Douglas'sability to secure a multiyear loan.</LP><TEXT>   Six banks are providing the credit: Chase Manhattan Bank,Morgan Guaranty, First Chicago, Citibank, ABN Amro N.V. andBank of New York.   &quot;From a symbolic standpoint, having the agreement is veryimportant,&quot; Mr. Lanese said.   Indeed, the new lines of credit come as McDonnell Douglasstruggles to convince investors that it has greatly improvedits financial position during the past six months.   Last week, at a hearing before the House subcommittee onoversight and investigations, top Pentagon auditor WilliamReed told lawmakers that he believed McDonnell Douglas may beunable &quot;to raise sufficient cash to maintain ongoingoperations.&quot;   While many securities analysts dismissed Mr. Reed'sstatements as political flotsam, the comments nonethelesscast new doubts on the company's health. In New York StockExchange composite trading, McDonnell Douglas shares closedFriday at $59.125 a share, off $1.75 a share.   Mr. Lanese stressed that McDonnell Douglas has no plans totap the $400 million line, calling it &quot;just stuff to keep inyour back pocket.&quot;   In fact, the company appears to be far ahead of itsdebt-reduction schedule. In July, Mr. Lanese had indicatedthere was &quot;a very good chance&quot; the company's debt level atyear end could fall below the $2.6 billion it hit at the endof 1989. Now, he said, it looks as if McDonnell Douglas'sdebt could have fallen to a level &quot;close to that&quot; figure inthe third quarter. (The company will release itsthird-quarter results shortly.) That would leave McDonnellDouglas, which currently has access to $3.6 billion in creditlines, with about $1 billion in remaining borrowing capacity.   Although $2.6 billion in debt would still leave McDonnellDouglas as one of the aerospace industry's most highlyleveraged companies, it would mark an impressive improvementsince debt hit $3.3 billion last March. The company's cashposition was so squeezed earlier in the year that McDonnellDouglas officials even requested a special $1 billion advancefrom the Pentagon.   Since then, the company has continued to increaseproduction of its commercial jets, cut costs and unloadassets. It recently sold its auto leasing business for anestimated $125 million to General Electric Co.'s creditsubsidiary, which analysts say may be interested in acquiringmore parts of McDonnell Douglas's financial services arm. Inaddition, McDonnell Douglas expects to close this month thesale of its systems integration unit to General MotorsCorp.'s Electronic Data Systems division; that property couldfetch more than $250 million, analysts believe.   There are still dangers ahead. McDonnell Douglas mayultimately be forced to take hundreds of millions of dollarsin additional write-offs on some of its troubled militaryprograms, including the C-17 cargo jet. Still, &quot;today, forthe first time in a long time, they look like they have ashot at grabbing the golden ring,&quot; said Howard Rubel, of C.J.Lawrence Inc.   Ultimately, Mr. Lanese said, McDonnell Douglas plans tomake a public debt offering. But poor debt-market conditionsand McDonnell Douglas's own low debt ratings continue todelay that step.   The company hopes the $400 million agreement will helpspeed things along. &quot;A three-year deal in this environment --where banks are having as difficult a time as aerospacecompanies -- is really a strong show of support,&quot; said BillAustin, McDonnell Douglas's treasurer.</TEXT></DOC>
