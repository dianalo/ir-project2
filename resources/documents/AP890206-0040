Today's bathing is the high point of the seven-week Kumbh Melafestival, which according to the Guinness Book of World Records isthe largest religious gathering on Earth.   The ceremonial bathing began at 4 a.m. with the blowing of conchshells and the chanting of hymns by the faithful, who believe a dipin the rivers on this astrologically auspicious day will free themfrom the cycle of reincarnation and allow them to achieve salavation.   Hindus believe that Lord Brahma, creator of the world in theHindu religion and a member of the supreme trinity in the pantheonof Hindu gods, awakens at 4 a.m. and therefore the day should startat that hour.   The Kumbh Mela is celebrated every 12 years, according to thelunar calendar, at the time of a rare planetary convergence: Jupiterin Taurus, the sun and moon in Capricorn, and a series ofcomplicated calculations of Hindu astrology.   But today takes on added significance, for it is also the day ofthe new moon, another good omen.   Two people died in the early hours of the mass bathing. A50-year-old man collapsed on the river bank after his bath and soondied, and a woman drowned when her boat capsized, according to apolice officer who spoke on condition of anonymity. In 1954, about800 pilgrims died in a stampede at the holy festival.   ``Either these people are crazy or there must be something wecan't see or understand,'' said Nina Marshall, a 23-year-old studentfrom Berkeley, Calif. who was among dozens of Americans that came tosee the religious spectacle.   ``It is vibrating,'' she said, pointing to the barefoot pilgrimstrekking to the junction of the Ganges and Jamuna rivers.   For the faithful, the bathing is often a once-in-a-lifetimeopportunity.   ``I planned this trip five years back when we had a good crop,''said Sarju Mahato, a farmer from Bihar state, as he tended theblisters on his two sons' feet. ``We saved money and came here.''   The festival takes the name Kumbh Mela from a story in Hindumythology in which a god seized a pot of nectar that made godsinvincible in their war against the demons. ``Kumbh'' means pot, and``mela'' means fair.   A drop of nectar from the pot is thought to have fallen atAllahabad where the Ganges and Jamuna rivers come together. A bathat the exact spot where the nectar fell is supposed to bringsalvation from the cycle of birth and rebirth.   The bathing at the Kumbh Mela began with processions of holy men,their order determined from days of yore according to the importanceof their sects, dipping at the confluence of the Ganges, the Yamunaand the mythical Swaraswati.   The Swaraswati cannot be seen, but Hindus believe it flowsbeneath the Earth's surface where the two other rivers meet.   There was color everywhere _ a profusion of saffron, scarlet,white and gold robes.   Some holy men wore only loincloths. Some had their foreheadssmeared with vermilion and sandalwood paste, and some wore garlandsof basil wreaths around their necks, wrists and arms.   Some had shaven heads, others matted hair tied in knots atoptheir heads.   The ``nagas,'' or naked recluses, smeared their bodies withashes. They wore garlands of marigolds around their necks and blewconch shells to drive away evil spirits.   They danced holding spears, lances, staffs and small rocksrepresenting some of the Hindu faith's 32 million gods and goddesses.   There were camels draped in brightly embroidered cloths, adornedwith feathers, beads and mirrors, with bells on their feet thattinkled when they walked.   Some pilgrims pulled chariots holding the holiest of the holymen, who offered blessings to the others.   The bathing followed the initiation of new nagas. Young men areinducted into the naked order only once every 12 years during theKumbh Mela.   On Sunday, 1,500 nagas-to-be shaved their heads, burned theirclothing and performed their last rites.   ``From this moment they have renounced the material world andsince they will not depend on anyone anymore, they themselvesperform their last rites as if they are already dead from thisworld,'' explained M.P. Ashnata, the fair's chief spokesman.</TEXT></DOC>
