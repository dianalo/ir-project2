Frontiers also has teamed with Trout Unlimited to open up Sovietfishing to Western anglers under a new agreement signed by Americanand Soviet sportsmen.   ``We are committed to making this happen and we're looking atinaugurating it in the '89 season,'' Mrs. Fitzgerald says. ``We arefocusing on rivers in the Soviet Union which come into the WhiteSea. There are fantastic Atlantic salmon in them, and we have about500 people just waiting to sign up for the first trips.''   Mrs. Fitzgerald has fished on four continents and a multitude ofislands. After a recent trip to Christmas Island in the Pacific,where she relentlessly hauled in 8-pound bonefish for a week, shewrote in the Orvis News:   ``...that silver shadow, swimming nose down and tail visible in10 to 20 inches of sparkling water, makes your heart standstill...when I connect, it's dynamite. You can't imagine a morethrilling five to 15 minutes...''   If merely visiting some of the world's best fishing holes isn'tenough, there are investment opportunities available in all the``hot spots'' for fanatics who can afford them.   In Montana, a buyer can get nearly two miles of Ruby Riverfrontage, a 3,000-square-foot log home, and a guest house for$550,000.   In Alaska, a luxurious fly-in fishing lodge which canaccommodate 20 guests in the King Salmon area is listed for about$2 million.   Mike George of Polar Realty in Anchorage, after joking that``anything's for sale in Alaska in these hard economic times,''adds that there are many smaller lodges for sale, starting at$150,000.   ``We've had substantial inquiries and even some purchases fromforeign investors who want to get into the Alaska recreationmarket,'' George says.   A recent ad in Fly Fisherman Magazine spotlighted a property inQuebec which boasted a six-bedroom, furnished estate, caretaker'shouse, 330 acres, ``Atlantic salmon and trout river. Duck marsh andgame hunting.'' Mere dreamers need not apply: the ad warns``serious inquiries only.''   In the British Isles there is almost no public sports-fishingwater left. The resale value of fishing rights is based on thenumber of fish expected to be caught in a year along thatparticular stretch of river. A 10-year average catch is used as abenchmark.   Thirty years ago the average sale price was $100 to $300 perAtlantic salmon per year. Today the rate can top $7,000 per salmonon such famous Scottish rivers as the Tweed or the Spey and the Dee.   Each section of private ownership is called a ``beat.''Individual beats average 200 to 300 yards. In recent years thepopularity of fly fishing has prompted beat owners to divide themup into time shares, just like condominiums on the Costa del Soland the French Riviera.   If a fisherman expects to catch 20 fish during his annual weekon a popular river, he may pay as much as $150,000 for his timeshare. That adds up to $6,500 per fish.   Renting the same rights for a one-time, one-week fling can costas much as $50 for every fish the angler expects to catch, based onthe river's past performance.   That doesn't match the value the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Serviceplaced on one of its trout this year _ Goldie, a prized 4-year-oldalbino that vanished last Christmas from the Ennis, Mont., NationalFish Hatchery.   In a WANTED bulletin, federal biologists said that when Goldiedisappeared from their visitor display pond ``she weighed more than20 pounds and was distinguished by her golden yellow color.''   The feds put up a $2,500 reward for information leading to herrecovery, dead or alive. Her frozen body was found in February in asnowbank near Steamboat Springs, Colo.   Federal wildlife agents say two men stole Goldie and two otherfish from the government's pond, first took her to a bar inBozeman, Mont., then weighed her in a Milner, Colo., grocery store(23 pounds). They finally got rid of the victim when they heardauthorities were searching for her.   A tip from Montana and from someone who saw the fish in thegrocery store helped agents track down the suspects. The governmentis now seeking to determine who earned the reward and mayprosecute, depending on the outcome of the FWS investigation.   Goldie's remains today are on ice in the Denver FWS office.   ``Once she's no longer needed for evidence, we plan to preserveGoldie, then display her at the Ennis hatchery with a sign tellingabout the Great Fish Saga,'' says Jack Hallowell, FWS assistantregional director for public affairs.   Now THAT's a fish story. As Hallowell put it, ``Goldie becamethe most sought-after fish since Moby Dick.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, June 12</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
