Essentially, the algorithm is based on a generalizedperturbation theory. The 'coarse mesh method' has previously been proposedfor solving a multidimensional diffusion equation at a point in a hexagonalcell. It contains a term which accurately expresses the characteristicsof neutron leak in the neiborhood of the cell. The algorithm has beendeveloped by using such a neutron balance equation as above that incorporatesan improved macroscopic constant. In the present study, the algorithmis applied to developing a set of programmes that are based on the generalizedperturbation theory. A form of three-dimensional diffusion equation tobe employed for calculation is derived and adjoint equations to be usedin carrying out the generalized perturbation algorithm are described.Discussions are made on the stability of calculation results. Such stabilityevaluation is indispensable to determine the performance of a calculationprocedure. Some calculation results for two- or three-dimensional breederreactor models are presented and the performance of the calculation proceduresare discussed. (Nogami, K.).</TEXT></DOC>
