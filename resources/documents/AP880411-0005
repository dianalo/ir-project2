Here is a report on the situation.</TEXT><BYLINE>By JEFF BRADLEY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Retailing magnate Robert Campeau's $6.6 billiontakeover of the Federated Department Store empire topped a surge inCanadian investment south of the border.   The Campeau Corp. deal last month was the largest Canadiantakeover in the United States. For Campeau, who left his nativeSudbury, Ontario, with an eighth grade education and retains aslight French-Canadian accent, it surpassed his $3.6 billionacquisition of New York-based Allied Stores Corp. in 1986.   Canadian investment in the United States has encompassed primereal estate from Manhattan to Minneapolis, railways, pulp and papermills, oil wells, telecommunications and many other industries.   Here are some examples:   _ The Reichmann brothers of Toronto _ Paul, Albert and Ralph _control 8 percent of Manhattan's office space, including the WorldFinancial Center and Battery Park City, through their Olympic andYork Developments Ltd.   _ Northern Telecom, a subsidiary of BCE Inc., which includesBell Canada, is the second-largest telecommunications manufacturerin the United States with 14 Nortel plants and about 23,000American employees.   _ Imasco Ltd. of Montreal owns the Hardee's fast-food chain and830 Peoples Drug Stores in the United States; Seagram recentlybought Tropicana orange juice from Beatrice Foods; Canadians KenThomson and Conrad Black publish dozens of U.S. newspapers; and theforestry and paper empires of Noranda and MacMillan Bloedel extendacross the border, as does the industrial might of Alcan Aluminium.   Canada and the United States form the world's largest tradingpartnership, and a majority of the Fortune 500 companies long haveoperated above the 49th parallel.   But until recently, Canada had been relegated to junior partner.As recently as 1975, direct Canadian investment in the UnitedStates stood at just $5.4 billion.   By the end of 1986, however, this had soared to $29 billion, andthe Canadian stake is now closer to $40 billion, according toCanadian government statistics.   The 1986 figure compares with $55 billion worth of direct U.S.investment in Canada, and the gap is closing.   ``Over the past 10 years, Canadian investment in the U.S. isgrowing faster than U.S. investment in Canada,'' said businessmanagement professor Alan Rudman of the University of Toronto, aspecialist in the topic.   He cited 20 percent annual growth in Canadian investment in theUnited States, compared with 7 percent growth in the otherdirection. By the early 1990s, the amounts will be equal, hepredicted.   ``What's happened is that in the past 20 years the Canadianeconomy has matured, and our business sector has become worldclass.''   Rudman said 70 percent of Canada-U.S. trade is conducted bymultinationals _ 22 based in the United States and 21 in Canada _and 30 percent of the volume is from General Motors, Ford,Chrysler, and their Canadian subsidiaries.   Meanwhile, Canada's overall share of investment in the UnitedStates actually has declined from 20 percent to 8 percent in thepast 12 years, Rudman said, because Europeans and Japanese havebeen pouring dollar holdings back into U.S. businesses.   Many of those foreign acquisitions have alarmed Americans, butthe Canadian invasion has met little opposition. ``Canadian firmsblend in so well they cause little hostility,'' said Rudman.   Flushed with success at netting Federated _ more than 650 storesin 15 chains, including the tony Bloomingdale's _ Campeau told anews conference in New York:   ``I consider myself a North American. What I like about theUnited States is a more wide-open private enterprise system wherethere is less interference by government than there is in Canada.''   That will remain the case for Canadians under a bilateral FreeTrade Agreement to take effect next January if ratified by Congressand Parliament. Canadian investors will enjoy unfettered access inthe United States, but any U.S. investment over $150 million willcome in for scrutiny by Ottawa.   Other attractions for Canadian investors include a market 10times bigger and lower taxes.   Campeau, 63, the youngest of seven children, runs his realestate and retailing empire from offices in Manhattan and Toronto.Father of six, he lives in Toronto with his second wife in a11,000-square foot mansion with an Olympic-sized swimming pool.   A personal friend of former Premier Pierre Trudeau, a fellowFrench-Canadian, Campeau became the federal government's biggestlandlord after building 40 percent of the government-occupiedoffice space in Ottawa.   ``He got too big for Canada,'' said analyst Don Tigert ofinvestment brokers Burns Fry Ltd.</TEXT></DOC>
