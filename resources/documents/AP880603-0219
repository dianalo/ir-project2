(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A policeman held hostage by two armedex-convicts for almost nine hours last month says that at times hiscaptors were so congenial he felt as if he were on a fishing tripwith friends.   ``There was one problem,'' officer Larry G. Strayer said. ``Theyhad guns and they were pointed at my head.''   At one point Strayer, convinced he was about to die, told hiscaptors to ``make it quick,'' he said in an interview publishedFriday in The Oregonian. He also said he wondered whether he hadbought enough life insurance to provide for his wife, his21-year-old daughter and 18-year-old son.   But he also said his ``natural gift for gab'' and experience asa prison guard helped him get along with his captors and buy timeuntil he was able to escape.   Albert W. Reinhart, 42, and Michael R. Ager, 37, of Tacoma,Wash., held Strayer at gunpoint after he went to their motel roomMay 12 to look for a man sought for a supermarket robbery.   Strayer, 43, finally escaped after the two men fell asleep andhe grabbed Reinhart's gun, fatally shot Reinhart and wounded Ager.   Ager, who had said throughout the night that he would not goback to prison, refused to give up even then. He later shot himselfand died after police fired tear gas into the room.   The two men, both heroin addicts, told Strayer they had robbedthe store to get drug money.   During the ordeal, Strayer, a former guard at San Quentin Prisonin California, forced himself to joke and talk with his captors.   ``They thought like cons and acted like cons,'' he said.``Because of my background, I've learned how to establish a rapportwith a convict. It's a knack I never lost. I've got a natural giftfor gab, and that's what I did that night while I figured out howto escape.''   ``They weren't verbally abusive, and they had not manhandledme,'' he said. ``It was like three buddies had gone fishingsomewhere.''   Strayer was taken hostage after he had handcuffed Reinhart as asuspect in the robbery. Suddenly, Ager was pointing a gun atStrayer's head about 7 feet away, and he ordered two other officersat the scene to leave.   ``I couldn't believe it,'' Strayer said. ``I was looking rightdown the barrel of the gun. I mean, I could see the bullet in thecylinder. I put my hands up slowly and said, `Don't shoot me.'''   When the late-evening news came on, the captors learned that thebureau's Special Emergency Response Team had surrounded the motel,Strayer recalled.   ``They come through that door and you're dead,'' Reinhart toldStrayer.   He had another hair-raising moment after the captors first fellasleep, about 3 a.m. Strayer was ready to bolt for the door whenthe phone rang. It was a hostage negotiator, who told Reinhart thedrugs that the captors had demanded would not be delivered.   ``I thought to myself, `Tough luck,''' Strayer recalled. ``Itdawned on me how asleep he had been.''   Strayer finally got out about an hour later when the pair weresleeping again.   ``I'm a police officer! I shot them!'' he shouted as he left themotel room. He was hustled into a police van across the street,where he used a mobile phone to call his wife.   ``I was crying; everyone in the van was crying,'' he said. ``Itold her I was out and OK. It was all over.''</TEXT></DOC>
