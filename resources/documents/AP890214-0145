(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An advanced navigation satellitesoared into orbit Tuesday aboard the maiden flight of the AirForce's new Delta 2 rocket, a booster developed to carry vitalmilitary payloads grounded after the space shuttle Challengerexplosion.   It was the first of at least 54 new unmanned rockets the Pentagonis ordering in a $14 billion program to resolve a post-Challengercrisis that has seen about 40 needed reconnaissance and othernational security payloads languish in storage for want of a launchvehicle.   The Navstar Global Positioning System satellite carried on theDelta 2's maiden flight Tuesday was the first military payloadshifted off the shuttle manifest to a throwaway booster.   The $30 million, 128-foot rocket roared off its launch pad at1:30 p.m., and the Air Force reported 30 miunutes later it hadperformed flawlessly in lofting the $65 million satellite into aninitial elliptical orbit ranging from about 100 to 11,000 milesabove the Earth.   ``It was in every way a picture-perfect launch,'' Air Force Lt.Col. Bob Tayloe, the launch director, told a news conference. ``Thesatellite came up very strong and we're receiving a good signal.''   On Thursday, an on-board rocket motor is to fire to shift thesatellite into a circular orbit about 11,000 miles up.   The 3,675-pound Navstar GPS is an advanced version of sevenearlier model Navstars currently in orbit. The new satellite willtell U.S. and allied military forces where they are to within a fewfeet anywhere on the globe _ land, sea or air.   The new satellite has more power and other improved systems andhas two information channels instead of one, with the second beingencrypted for use only by the military.   Users of the military channel will be able to plot theirlocations to within 50 feet, in some cases to within 5 or 6 feet,officials said.   Civilian users will have to be satisfied with an accuracy ofabout 300 feet, still pretty good if a person is in the middle of anocean or a jungle, said Col. Marty E. Runkle, director of the JointGlobal Positioning System Office of the Air Force Space Division.   ``Just about any military system or operation you can conceive ofcan use the GPS system for location _ airplanes, trucks, submarines,tanks, troops, whatever,'' Runkle told a news conference. ``Midairrefueling or a linkup at sea in dark nights, through the fog, can bedone without any communications or turning on of radar. Typicallyyou have to turn on radar and essentially light up the sky.''   The satellite is the first of 21 of the upgraded Navstars the AirForce plans to orbit to complete a global system by 1992, givinganyone anywhere in the world 24-hour access to the positioninginformation.   The Air Force originally planned to launch all 21 on NASA's spaceshuttle fleet. But that plan was scrapped after the shuttleChallenger exploded on Jan. 28, 1986. Now only two Navstars remainscheduled on the shuttle.   Pentagon officials decided after Challenger they had made amistake in abandoning unmanned rockets to launch all payloads on theshuttle, and authorized the building of three new models of rockets_ the medium-size Delta 2 and Atlas 2 and the much larger Titan 4.   The Delta 2, a more powerful version of the earlier Delta rocketthat has been flying since 1960, is the first of the new rockets tofly. The Titan 4 is scheduled to debut next month and the Atlas 2next year.   The grounding of the shuttle and the Air Force Titan 34D rocket,also after a 1986 failure, created a backlog of about 40reconnaisance, communications, navigation and other nationalsecurity satellites.   Six more Delta, four Titan and two military shuttle flightsscheduled this year will help drain down that backlog.</TEXT></DOC>
