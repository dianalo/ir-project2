Pickup7th graf pvs, `Sue Adams...'</HEAD><DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A freighter carrying a container of toxic wasteleft Britain today after the country's largest port refused toaccept the cargo and officials at a second port said they would notaccept the shipment.   Authorities at Tilbury, at the mouth of the Thames River,Wednesday blocked the unloading of a container of polychlorinatedbiphenyls, or PCBs, from Canada carried aboard a Soviet freighter.   A port spokesman, John McNab, said the decision was made ``outof consideration for the work force and the local community.''   Members of the environmental group Greenpeace had met the shipKhudozhnik Saryan and placed poison warning labels on the hull asit entered the port.   Later Wednesday, authorities at Liverpool said they would reject1,800 tons of PCB waste expected from Canada in the next few months.   The Khudozhnik Saryan discharged all of its cargo except thesingle container containing the PCBs.   The ship left Tilbury early this morning for an unknowndestination. Port officials said it was returning to Montreal, butsome British news reports said it would first stop in anotherunidentified European country.   Sue Adams of Greenpeace said the group will track the ship'scourse and alert environmentalists in Belgium if there were anyattempt to unload the container there.   PCBs are disposed of by burning, but there is a danger thathighly toxic dioxin can be formed if the temperature is not highenough.   Paul Horsman, director of the Greenpeace Toxic Unit, called onthe government to revoke the licences of companies bringing suchwaste into Britain. ``The UK is becoming the dumping ground of theworld,'' Horsman said.   Allan Roberts, the Labor Party's spokesman on the environment inthe House of Commons, said Britain accepted 800,000 tons of toxicwaste last year.   However, David Boyd, of the National Association of WasteDisposal Contractors, said the figure was 80,000 tons. ``It is alegitimate trade that is to the benefit of the environment as awhole,'' Boyd said.</TEXT></DOC>
