In addition, 121 children below the age of13 were included as subjects. Nitrogen dioxide levels were measured in91 percent of the subject's homes for one two-week period of the 12-weekstudy. When controlling for socioeconomic status and a history of respiratoryillness, children under the age of seven exposed to 30 micrograms ormore per cubic meter of nitrogen dioxide were found to have an increasedrisk of reporting lower respiratory symptoms 2.17 times children whowere not exposed to nitrogen dioxide and an increased risk of reportingupper respiratory symptoms 1.33 times that of unexposed children. Olderchildren and adults show no increased reporting of symptoms of eitherlower respiratory illness or upper respiratory illness by measured nitrogendioxide level or source presence.</TEXT></DOC>
