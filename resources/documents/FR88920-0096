Applicants state that each Fund is an open-end management investmentcompany registered under the l940 Act. Each Fund (except the Currency Funds,the registration statements of which are not yet effective under the SecuritiesAct of 1933, as amended (the ``1933 Act'')), offers shares under a currently-effectiveregistration statement under the 1933 Act. EFH or SLH serves as the distributorof each Fund's shares which are offered at public offering prices as describedin the application. 2. EFH, a broker-dealer registered under the Securities Exchange Act of1934 and an investment adviser registered under the Investment AdvisersAct of 1940 as amended, is currently a wholly-owned subsidiary of the E.F.Hutton Group Inc. (``EFH Group''), a wholly-owned subsidiary of SLH. SLH,a registered broker-dealer and investment adviser is a wholly-owned subsidiaryof SLH Holdings (formerly, Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.), whichis in turn a majority-owned subsidiary of American Express Company. 3. Applicants seek the ability to permit the following exchange offersbetween Funds:(i) Shares of a Front-End Load Fund may be exchanged for shares of anotherFront-End Load Fund, except that if the sales load applicable to the sharesof the Front-End Load Fund being purchased exceeds the maximum sales loadthat could have been imposed in connection with the shares previously purchased(at the time such shares were acquired) without giving effect to any applicablereduction in sales loads, the difference will be deducted. Any sales loadcharged with respect to the acquired security will be a percentage thatis no greater than the excess, if any, of the rate of the sales load applicableto that security in the absence of an exchange over the total rate of anysales loads previously paid on the exchanged security. Accordingly, forexample, exchanges of shares of a Currency Fund for shares of a Front-EndLoad Fund other than a Currency Fund generally would be subject to paymentof only the difference between the sales load paid on shares of the CurrencyFund and the sales load ordinarily assessed for acquiring shares of theFront-End Load Fund; exchanges of shares of a Front-End Load Fund for sharesof a Currency Fund may be made on the basis of relative net asset valuewithout the payment of sales load; (ii) Shares of a No-Load Fund may be exchanged for shares of another No-LoadFund on the basis of relative net asset value without the payment of asales load; (iii) Shares of a Front-End Load Fund may be exchanged for shares of aNo-Load Fund on the basis of relative net asset value without the paymentof a sales load; (iv) Shares of a No-Load Fund may be exchanged for shares of any Front-EndLoad Fund subject to the sales load normally charged by the Front-End LoadFund (unless the investment in those shares was previously subject to asales load by one of the Front-End Load Funds or was acquired by dividendor distribution reinvestment in a Front-End Load Fund); and (v) Shares of a Back-End Load Fund may be exchanged for shares of anotherBack-End Load Fund on the basis of relative net asset value without thepayment of a sales load; (when shares of a Back-End Load Fund are exchangedfor shares of another  Back-End Load Fund, the purchase date for the sharesof the Fund exchanged into will be assumed to be the date on which theshares were purchased in the Fund from which the exchange was made). 4. It is currently contemplated that exchanges between Funds would notbe subject to the payment of any service charge. However, the Funds reservethe right to impose a nominal administrative fee in the future (in an amountnot exceeding $5.00 per exchange), applied uniformly to all shareholders.Shareholders of the relevant Fund would receive at least 60 days writtennotice prior to the imposition of any administrative fee, and the Fundwould supplement its prospectus to disclose the existence and amount ofthe fee prior to its implementation. In addition, any sales literaturedescribing the right of exchange would also disclose the amount of anyadministrative fee that would be imposed on exchanges and any advertisingthat mentions the existence of the exchange privilege would also disclosethe existence of any administrative fee imposed on exchanges. 5. Applicants will notify each Fund's shareholders of the exchange privilegeand any administrative fee primarily by means of the particular Fund'sprospectus. If any Fund modifies or terminates the exchange privilege,such Fund will provide shareholders a minimum of 60 days prior writtennotice of such modification or termination (except that in the case ofa reduction or termination of any administrative fee, prior notice shallnot be required), and such modification in a manner other than that contemplatedby the application (but not termination) will be described in an amendmentto the relief requested hereby. 6. Applicants are aware that some exchanges might provide an opportunityfor brokers, acting ostensibly on behalf of their clients, to initiateexchanges for the broker's own benefit. However, Applicants represent thatthe Distributors have established sufficient internal review proceduresto ensure that exchanges are made at the request of investors and not forthe brokers' personal gain and that they are actively monitoring customercomplaints and will continue to be alert to the possible abuses that mightoccur regarding the exchange privileges. <ITAG tagnum="84">Applicants, Legal Conclusions </ITAG>1. Applicants submit that the order requested is appropriate and in thepublic interest, and is consistent with the policies underlying the provisionsof the 1940 Act. 2. Applicants submit that the proposed exchanges will be consistent withrevised proposed Rule 11a-3 (Investment Company Act Release No. IC-16504,July 29, 1988), which would permit mutual funds and their principal underwritersto make exchange offers to shareholders of another fund in the same groupof investment companies. 3. The Funds distributed by SLH and EFH are members of the same group ofinvestment companies as defined in revised proposed Rule 11a-3, becauseSLH and EFH are under common control and hold themselves out to investorsas related companies for purposes of investment and investors services.<ITAG tagnum="84">Applicants' Proposed Conditions </ITAG>If the requested order is granted, Applicants agree to the following conditions:(i) Any administrative fee or any scheduled variation thereof will be uniformlyapplied to all offerees of the class specified; (ii) The exchange privilege among Funds, as well as any administrativefee, will comply with the requirements of revised proposed Rule 11a-3 ifand to the extent the Rule is adopted; (iii) Shareholders of each Fund will be notified of any administrativefee that may be imposed on an exchange transaction by means of each Fund'sprospectus and in other communications, including sales literature or advertisingthat describes the exchange program; (iv) Shareholders of each Fund will be notified of the Fund's exchangeprogram by means of the particular Fund's prospectus and in other communications,including sales literature or advertising; (v) Shareholders of each Fund will be notified by means of the particularFund's prospectus and in sales literature and advertising that discussesthe exchange privilege of the fact that the Fund reserves the right tomodify or terminate its exchange privilege; (vi) Shareholders will be notified in writing at least 60 days prior toany modification or termination of a particular Fund's exchange privilege,except in the case of a reduction or elimination of any administrativefee or sales load in which case notice shall not be required; provided,however, that the temporary cessation of the sale of Fund shares underextraordinary circumstances such as when the Fund is unable to effectivelyinvest amounts in accordance with applicable investment objectives, policiesand restrictions, or the suspension of the redemption of Fund shares pursuantto section 22(e) of the 1940 Act and the rules and regulations thereundershall not be considered a modification or termination of the particularFund's exchange privilege; (vii) Except as may otherwise be permitted by revised proposed Rule 11a-3,as adopted, Applicants undertake to obtain an amended order prior to anymodification (<T3>i.e., </T3>manner, frequency or basis) of the Funds' exchange privilegein a manner not described in the application; provided, however, that anamended order is not required in order to terminate the Funds' exchangeprivilege or to impose a nominal administrative fee ($5.00 or less), orto reduce or terminate any such administrative fee imposed; (viii) Applicants acknowledge that any order issued pursuant to this applicationis prospective in nature and, therefore, Applicants will not rely on anysuch order prior to its issuance as authority for any exchanges which occurredprior to the date of the order; (ix) Reductions in the sales load of any of the Load Funds will be in accordancewith the provisions of Rule 22d-1 under the 1940 Act; and (x) Any Additional Funds sold with a sales load that offer an exchangeprivilege and that seek to utilize the exemption provided hereby will havesales load structures and exchange privileges substantially identical toone or more of the Funds included herein and will be subject to the representationsand conditions included herein.<ITAG tagnum="21">For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuantto delegated authority.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan G.
