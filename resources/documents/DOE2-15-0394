MSH was more protective against radiation-inducedinactivation of transcription under N{sub 2} than under O{sub 2}. TheOH scavenger, t-butanol, on the other hand, gives significantly lessprotection under N{sub 2} than under O{sub 2}, apparently due to inactivationby secondary t-butanol radicals under anoxia as shown previously. However,MSH was found to restore most of the protective effect of t-butanol underN{sub 2}. Inactivation was studied as a function of MSH concentration[0.03-10 mM] at different, fixed concentrations of t-butanol [3-300 mM].The observed protection may be explained essentially in terms of (1)OH scavenging, (2) repair of DNA radicals by H-atom transfer from MSHunder N{sub 2} in competition with fixation of damage under O{sub 2},and (3) protection against inactivation by secondary t-butanol radicalsby H-atom transfer to these radicals. The sensitizing effect of oxygenin the presence of MSH is reduced by t-butanol and may even be reversedto produce an apparently protective effect. This finding is discussedin terms of residual inactivation by secondary radicals. The significanceof OH scavengers as potential modifiers of oxygen enhancement ratio valuesis discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
