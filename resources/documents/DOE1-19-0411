<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-19-0411 </DOCNO><TEXT>Increased atmospheric radioactivity from the Chernobyl accident was firstdetected on air filters taken in Monaco on 30 April 1986, with maximumactivities of 10, 2.9, 1.5 and 0.84 Bq m/sup -3/ for /sup 132/Te, /sup131/I, /sup 137/Cs and /sup 134/Cs, respectively, occurring about 1-3May 1986. About one week later the activities had fallen to about 1%of peak values. A total of 33 radioisotopes were detected. The integratedinventories were significantly less than at other sites to the east.Preliminary results of plutonium analyses are also presented, togetherwith other deposition data in rain and soil.</TEXT></DOC>
