Several proposals before Congress offer solutions rangingfrom a universal health system to tax credits for buying insurance.;  Insurers calculated that the bare-bones plans would have a strong appeal tosmall businesses, enabling them to recruit more qualified workers withbenefits that could be offered at little additional cost. In addition to thelower cost of the limited-benefit policies, existing federal tax incentivesand new tax incentives in some states would reduce the cost still further.;  But the dearth of employer interest in these basic policies, at a time whenhealth benefits are of paramount concern to workers, is bolstering thearguments of those who contend that the best way to provide health insuranceto the 34 million Americans who lack it is by requiring it.;   Most of thelimited-benefit policies, some of which can cost as little as about $50 amonth for a single person and more than $100 for a family, include thebenefits required in standard policies with the exception of treatment formental illness and alcohol and drug abuse. But they require the insured to paymore on doctor bills and for hospital stays and have lower maximum benefits.;  Already, 23 states, from New Jersey to Washington, have altered their laws toencourage the bare-bones insurance plans. Changes are under consideration inNew York and a dozen other states to make the insurance available. Theapproach involves no new taxes and, theoretically, could save millions of taxdollars spent on caring for the uninsured.;   &quot;It's a legislator's dream,&quot;said Richard Merritt, director of the Intergovernmental Health Policy Project,a non-profit research organization at George Washington University. But theplan has not been popular in the marketplace.;   In the half-dozen stateswhere insurers have marketed the limited-benefit policies, relatively fewemployers have signed on. The main reason, they say, is that the policies arestill too expensive. They generally require that employers pay at least halfthe premium.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  New York Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911110  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  8A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  441  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday, November 10, 199100315176,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
