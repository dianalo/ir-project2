The primary objectivesof this work were (1) to evaluate the applicability of the cosolventtheory to the sorption of dioxins to soils from water/methanol mixturesand (2) to utilize the cosolvent theory to obtain extrapolated estimatesof the water-phase partition coefficients for the PCDDs. The CDD isomersstudied were 2,3,7,8-tetra, 1,2,3,4,7-penta, 1,2,3,4,7,8-hexa, 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-heptaand octa. Six uncontaminated soils from Times Beach, MO were utilizedand ranged in fraction organic carbon from 0.0066-0.077. Sorption kineticswere found to be related to soil type and fraction methanol for all PCDDsstudied. A negative relationship was generally observed between the contacttime required to reach equilibrium for both fractions. Sorption isothermswere generally linear up to about 50% of the PCDD solubility predictedin the liquid phase being studied.</TEXT></DOC>
