Today, eight years after Rhodesia became black-governedZimbabwe, battalions of troops, including guerrilla veterans ofthat independence war, are strung along the same border _ this timeto block a new wave of incursions by guerrillas fighting tooverthrow Mozambique's government.   The outcome of the guerrillas' strikes in Mozambique and insideZimbabwe will have a major impact on the fragile economies of thetroubled region in southern Africa.   Several black-ruled states are striving to divert their tradetraffic from South Africa to Indian Ocean ports in Mozambique, aformer Portuguese colony, in a bid to loosen their economicdependency on the South Africans.   The rebels, in turn, vow to continue sabotaging Mozambique'ssupply lines that also serve Malawi, Zaire, Zambia and Zimbabwe.   So far, the 12,000 to 20,000 guerrillas of the anti-governmentMozambique National Resistance seem unharried by the conventionalforces ranged against them in Mozambique and Zimbabwe _ some 30,000Mozambican regulars, more than 12,000 Zimbabweans, 2,000 Tanzaniansand a few hundred Malawians.   The guerrillas, who call themselves nationalists opposing aMarxist-based government, roam Mozambique's 10 provinces and mountfrequent raids into Zimbabwe with virtual impunity.   ``It's very strange being on the other side,'' said a youngZimbabwean corporal who fought the Rhodesians under the nameComrade Hammer.   ``We know from our experience it's hard to beat guerrillas. Butthese people are just bandits and at least we know exactly how theythink and what they might do next.''   The guerrillas, known by the Portuguese acronym RENAMO,originally were formed by the Rhodesian intelligence service in1977, two years after Mozambique's independence from Portugal, toharass nationalist guerrillas directed by Robert Mugabe from insideMozambique during Zimbabwe's 1973-79 independence war.   Mugabe became Zimbabwe's prime minister at independence fromBritain in April 1980 and cut support to the Mozambican rebels. ButSouth Africa took over the reins until 1984 when it signed anon-aggression pact with Mozambique. Since then, Mozambique claimsSouth African support has continued, a charge denied by the SouthAfrican government.   The Mozambican rebels declared war on Zimbabwe last year afterMugabe vowed that a quarter of his forces stationed in Mozambiquewould fight to keep its government in power.   Since then they have stepped up raids along the 750-milefrontier of forested mountains and scrub-dotted plains.   Rebels have killed scores of villagers and some security-forcemilitias. They have abducted hundreds of civilians, includingchildren, and marched them at gunpoint into Mozambique, apparentlyas dragooned recruits.   They also have destroyed government schools, clinics anddevelopment projects; robbed country stores and remote homesteadsof food, drink and clothing; ambushed buses and looted passengers;ordered workers to leave forestry estates, coffee plantations andorchards; rustled cattle, sheep and goats.   Mugabe has exhorted his troops ``to erect an impassable defensealong our border'' to prevent fresh incursions.   He also urged them to renew military efforts inside Mozambique``to completely deny the enemy any ... chance to sabotage ourarteries to the sea.''   Lt. Col. Solomon Mujuru, a wartime guerrilla chieftain and nowZimbabwe's army commander, called on civilians living along thefrontier to report people they suspect might have links to theguerrillas.   But Mujuru said Zimbabwean troops had gained the upper hand incounterinsurgency operations since the first major incursions eightmonths ago.   Before June, Mujuru's soldiers and the rebels clashed only inMozambique.   Since then, troops of Zimbabwe's new 5,000-member 6th Brigadehave reinforced border defenses, militias are guarding farms,villages, schools and clinics and cross-border movement has beenbanned except at established immigration posts.   Anti-personnel mines have been sown where guerrillas are thoughtto cross into Zimbabwqe and the identification papers of some65,000 Mozambican refugees in three camps are being screened bylocal authorities and the United Nations High Commission forRefugees.   In addition, courts have cracked down on local peasantssuspected of links to the insurgents. Early in February, a Mutarejudge sent a woman to prison for six years and a man for five yearsfor failing to report the presence of bandits to officials.   At stake in the conflict is not only the survival of Mozambique,its economy already in ruins as a result of fighting and famine.   Also at issue is the fate of the so-called Beira Corridor, a186-mile trade route that meanders through mountains, fertilevalleys and swamps from the Zimbabwean border city to the IndianOcean port of Beira in Mozambique.   A fifth of the overseas trade of the black-ruled neighbor statesflows along the corridor's railroads and highways. LandlockedZimbabwe receives most of its fuel suppliers from a corridorpipeline despite repeated sabotage by the guerrillas. Most of thattrade and oil previously went through South Africa.   Both Mugabe and President Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique haverejected suggestions that they hold peace talks with theguerrillas, arguing that the rebels are puppets of South Africa'sgovernment and have no support from either the East or the West.   Mugabe, at the graduation ceremony for the 6th Brigade inSeptember, said he was forced to form the unit because of what hecalled South African destabilization in the region.   ``South Africa's subversion of Mozambique's ... sovereignity hadthe potential to completely deny us any routes to the sea,'' Mugabesaid.   ``The survival of Mozambique is our survival,'' Mugabe said.``The fall of Mozambique certainly also will be our fall.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, March 13</NOTE></DOC>
