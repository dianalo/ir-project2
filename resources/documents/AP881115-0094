Gorbachev will meetwith President Reagan and President-elect George Bush next month forwhat Reagan called ``a brief get-together.''   ``That's not going to be anything in the nature of a summitmeeting,'' the president said.   Asked if Gorbachev might bring new proposals to the meeting, thepresident said:   ``I have no way of speculating. We'll just have to see what comesup.''   Reagan commented as he posed for photographers before a meetingwith West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in the Oval Office.   ``We hope we can have a brief get-together,'' the president saidof the upcoming meeting, which will be his fifth with Gorbachev.   Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that neither a date nor a sitehas been set, although he acknowledged that it would likely takeplace in New York while Gorbachev is there to address the U.N.General Assembly.   Other officials, requesting anonymity, said Gorbachev wouldprobably meet with Reagan and Bush on Dec. 7.   Reagan, asked today if the December meeting could end up like thesummit in Iceland, to which Gorbachev brought surprise proposals onarms control but from which no agreements flowed, the presidentresponded, ``That depends on whether you are going by the publicversion of Reykjavik or what actually happened there.''   He did not elaborate and reporters went on to other questions.   When a reporter noted that Bush has said he does not need to getacquainted with Gorbachev because he already is, the presidentreplied that the vice president ``has been involved in the meetingsthat we've had in all these eight years we've been here and he hasmet and is familiar with all the national leaders that we've met....''   Asked, then, why Bush was going to be at the meeting, he said,``I think now, in his present situation, it would be proper for himto be present.''   Fitzwater said Reagan and Bush would meet, probably together,with Gorbachev, for what Fitzwater said was intended to be ``acordial meeting between superpower leaders reflecting the friendshipthey have created and the historic change in the relationshipbetween the United States and the Soviet Union,'' he said.   In Moscow, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimovsaid Gorbachev would meet with the U.S. leaders as part of ``acontinuation of the U.S.-Soviet political dialogue that we believeshould continue without artificial pause.''   Fitzwater said the main purpose of the meeting from the U.S.standpoint would be to ``ensure that the momentum and continuity ofthe arms control talks are extended and it will reaffirm therelationship between the general secretary and the new president ofthe United States.''   ``I would not look to it as a meeting that would be settlingthings (differences),'' Fitzwater said.   Fitzwater acknowledged that the Kremlin had proposed thatGorbachev meet with Reagan and Bush in just the last few days andthat the administration had quickly approved the request.   Gorbachev also will visit Britain and Cuba, the Soviet newsagency Tass aid in a dispatch from Moscow.   ``Mikhail Gorbachev intends to appear in New York at the sessionof the General Assembly of the U.N. to set forth the views of theSoviet Union on the most important problems of world development,''Tass said.   Earlier, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher announced thatGorbachev and his wife, Raisa, would visit London Dec. 12-14.Buckingham Palace said today that Queen Elizabeth II also intendedto meet with Gorbachev.   A get-together would also give the two sides another chance tonarrow the gap on a treaty to reduce long-range nuclear weaponsarsenals and to ease tensions caused by Afghan rebel attacks onSoviet troops in Afghanistan and a slowdown in the Red Army'swithdrawal from the country.   The treaty is bogged down with several technical problems thatmay not be easily solved. But on Afghanistan, the Soviets alreadyhave pledged to have all their forces out by Feb. 15.   Two weeks ago, citing attacks by the U.S.-armed rebels, theSoviets announced suspension of the withdrawal. Still, Gorbachev hasnot ruled out adhering to the deadline set in last spring's Genevaaccords.   A year ago, the Soviet leader made his first trip to the UnitedStates. At a Washington summit with Reagan, he signed anunprecedented treaty to abolish U.S. and Soviet intermediate-rangenuclear weapons.   It was the first arms control treaty to actually reduce nucleararsenals. But a pact on strategic weapons, which are globe-girdlingand far more deadly, has continued to elude U.S. and Sovietnegotiators.   Reagan and Gorbachev have held four annual meetings beginning in1985, improving U.S.-Soviet relations on a number of fronts. Bush,meanwhile, said after winning the presidency last week that he wouldlike to hold a summit meeting with the Soviet leader.   Bush has set relatively easy conditions for a summit meeting withthe Soviet leader sometime after moving into the White House inJanuary. He asked only that it produce progress on arms control,human rights or regional disputes.   But first, Bush said, he would have James A. Baker III, whom hehas named as his choice for secretary of state, meet with SovietForeign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and with foreign ministersof the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.   Bush ruled out a mere get-acquainted session. ``I am acquaintedwith him,'' the president-elect said of Gorbachev. ``What I want tosee is progress. I've never supported meetings just for the sake ofhaving meetings.''   Reagan first met with Gorbachev in Geneva, Switzerland, inNovember 1985. They held their second summit in 1986 in Reykjavik,Iceland, then met in Washington last December and in Moscow May29-June 2.   The two superpowers are close to an agreement to reduce theirarmories of long-range bombers, missiles and submarines by 30 to 50percent, but are wrestling with problems over how to verify some ofthe cutbacks.</TEXT></DOC>
