It is not from an enemy country.   Chandipur's 12,000 villagers want to stall the test-firing ofIndia's first long-range ballistic missile.   They say it is potentially dangerous and eventually will makethem homeless. They fear the missile named ``AGNI,'' which means``fire'' in Hindi, may carry nuclear warheads.   The test-firing scheduled later this month will bracket Indiaalong with the United States, the Soviet Union, France, Britain andChina in ballistic missile capability, military experts say.   It also will enhance the power of India's 1.36 million-strongarmy and the country's geopolitical influence in the region, theysay.   ``It is more a technology demonstration, but it can be used indefense should the country require,'' said V.S. Arunachalam, whohas overseen India's defense research since 1982.   ``Will it carry nuclear warheads?'' he asked. ``If you want, youcan carry a nuclear warhead even on a bullock cart.''   Since April 1987, India successfully has tested three types ofsurface-to-air and surface-to-surface missiles, with ranges varyingfrom 5{ to 155 miles.   Villagers in Chandipur are being lured with money and promisesof free food and popular film videos if they leave their homesduring launch time and move to temporary camps set up in the area.   But they refuse to budge, and the battle of wits shows no signof settlement.   At the maximum-security launch site on the Bay of Bengal about300 scientists and technocrats are putting final touches to themissile.   They expect it to travel between 370 miles and 1,550 miles, ascientist said on condition of anonymity. The missile will carry aone-ton payload.   ``The project is one of great national importance,'' Lt. Gen.R.S. Deswal, chief of National Test Range, said in an interview.``This is what we are telling the villagers.''   Military test-firing is nothing new to this village, where thecolonial British set up an arms and ammunition test range 95 yearsago.   Scientists have been experimenting with two other missiles thatwere test-fired in 1987 and in 1988.   But what sparked the controversy surrounding the new missile wasan official announcement earlier this year asking villagers tovacate their homes.   ``For the past three years, we are asking the government what ishappening,'' said Arun Dey, a former legislator who heads the mainanti-missile group. ``Their stock reply was `nothing major, justroutine firing and enlarging the facilities.' Now out of the bluethey are telling us that they will fire a real big missile.''   Most Chandipur residents are fishermen or farmers who arrivedhere after the 1942 Bengal famine, which killed up to 1 millionpeople.   ``Let them fire the missile, but we not going to leave ourhomes,'' said Gaur Singh of the Chandipur People's ProtectionCommittee. ``They will have to fire a missile first at us and thenthey can fire another at the sky.   ``We have said we will not go,'' he said. ``We maintain anightlong vigil because we fear that they may force us out.''   Conch shells are blown to alert people in other hamlets.   The government wants the people living in a two-mile radius ofthe launch pad to vacate their homes for four hours during thelaunch.   But villagers fear it is a ploy.   ``We are not asking them to leave for good, just during thelaunch period,'' said the general, who said officials have offeredevery adult $5.20 and each child $2.60 as compensation.   Singh said: ``It is good money, no doubt, but should you tradeyour existence for that?''</TEXT></DOC>
