The Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Manhattan, saidthat trial judges have been too cautious in restricting theuse of DNA evidence, which is based on the genetic blueprintfound in a person's chromosomes.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Although scientific and statistical evidence may seemcomplicated, we do not think that a jury will be so dazzledor swayed as to ignore evidence suggesting that an experimentwas improperly conducted or that testing procedures haven'tbeen established,&quot; the court said.   The ruling by the influential appeals court is good newsfor federal prosecutors. Last month the Federal Bureau ofInvestigation was put on the defensive after a scientificjournal published a study questioning the statisticalreliability of DNA evidence.   The Second Circuit's decision is binding only in federalcourts in New York, Connecticut and Vermont, but it is likelyto be cited as a precedent in other jurisdictions.   State courts across the country have set varying standardsfor allowing DNA evidence to be used to identify a defendant.In such cases, prosecutors match up a DNA profile from thedefendant with a profile taken from a sample of blood, semenor hair found at the scene of the crime. Typically,prosecutors argue that chances are only one in severalhundred million that the matching DNA profiles could havecame from more than one person.   But defense attorneys and some scientists say prosecutorsare exaggerating the reliability of the DNA profile. Althoughthe high courts of several states have ruled that DNAevidence is admissible, many judges have expressed concernover the soundness of the data.   The Second Circuit said in its decision last week that theprocedures investigators use to evaluate DNA evidence arebecoming generally accepted by specialists in the field. Theappellate panel said trial judges needn't conduct extensivehearings to determine whether the DNA evidence should beadmitted.   The Second Circuit's decision is at odds with a 1990ruling from the Eighth Circuit in St. Louis, which held thata judge must determine whether DNA testing procedures wereproperly conducted.   William K. Sessions III, the defense attorney in the casebefore the Second Circuit, said, &quot;There are deep divisions inthe scientific community and, I believe, in the legalcommunity as to whether DNA evidence is reliable.&quot; He saidhis client, who was convicted in 1990 of kidnapping, hasn'tdecided whether to appeal.   Other defense attorneys expressed concern over theincreasing use of DNA evidence, which they said jurors arereluctant to question. Harvey Silverglate, a defense attorneyin Boston, said that for most jurors, DNA evidence &quot;carrieswith it an aura of being close to 100% accurate.&quot;   ---   BILLING BY THE HOUR is on its way out at Dallas law firm.   Bickel andamp; Brewer is trying to phase out hourly billing,according to the 51-lawyer firm's co-founder, William BrewerIII. In the past few months the law firm, which does mostlylitigation, has been making agreements with clients to handletheir cases for a fixed fee, based on goals set by thecompanies, he said. The agreements include provisions forpremium payments if the firm exceeds the clients'expectations, he added.   Some clients still prefer to be billed by the hour, hesaid, but others have welcomed the fixed-fee system becauseit allows those clients to set their own budgets for legalfees.   Law firms have traditionally billed on an hourly basis,but the system has increasingly come under attack by clientsarguing that it only encourages lawyers to stretch out work.   As part of the shift to performance-based fees, Bickel andamp;Brewer also is doing away with set, seniority-based salariesfor its associates. That lock-step salary structure typicallyassumes that associates will work a certain number ofbillable hours.   Under a new merit-based salary program, Bickel andamp; Brewerwill review associates' performance at the end of each yearand boost -- or cut -- their pay accordingly. Hours billedwon't be emphasized in associates' performance reviews, afirm spokesman said.   Bickel andamp; Brewer has long touted its practice of payingfirst-year associates the same or better than the going-rateat big New York law firms. The firm didn't boast about thatthis year, although its $85,000 annual pay for first-yearassociates, plus perquisites, does beat the New York averageof $83,000.   ---   SCRAP METAL DEALERS may have to pay for toxic cleanups.   A U.S. magistrate recommended that scrap dealers be heldliable for cleanups of sites owned by recyclers to whom theysold metal. The magistrate's findings, which must be approvedby a federal judge, were made in a dispute between scrapdealers and the Environmental Protection Agency.   Magistrate Judge Robert C. Mitchell said the dealers ineffect had arranged for the disposal of the metals and weretherefore liable for cleanup costs.   The recycling facility, known at different times as PessesCo. and the Metallurgical Corp. of America, in LawrenceCounty, Pa., bought and recycled scrap metals, such ascopper, lead nickel and chrome, as well as used products,such as nickel cadmium batteries.   In 1986 the EPA discovered that the site was polluted. Inan effort to recover cleanup costs, the EPA sued the site'sowner and 25 companies that sent scrap to the recycler.   Attorneys representing the scrap dealers plan to fileobjections to the magistrate's finding with the federaljudge. &quot;We find this decision incredible given the nature ofgovernment policies and goals to encourage resourcerecovery,&quot; said Howard J. Wein, of the Pittsburgh law firmKlett Lieber Rooney andamp; Schorling, who represents 15 of thescrap dealers. Mr. Wein said that if the recommendationstands it could undermine the entire scrap industry.</TEXT></DOC>
