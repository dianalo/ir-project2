(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A soldier who wants a discharge so she cancare for her infant daughter said Thursday she has no hard feelingsagainst the Army but has found that military service and motherhooddon't mix.   ``I like the Army. I have nothing bad to say about it. I justdon't feel it's right for me,'' Spec. 4 Cheryl Beekman said in aninterview from her office at Fort Eustis in Newport News.   Ms. Beekman, 21, filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court after shereceived orders to leave for South Korea without her 6-month-olddaughter, Lauren, and the Army denied her request for a discharge.   The Army agreed Wednesday to postpone her transfer while thecourt case is pending, but Ms. Beekman said she is still anxious toleave the service before her four-year hitch ends next year.   ``I want out. It has nothing to do with going to South Korea,really,'' she said. ``I have a hard time being in the military witha child. That's what it comes down to. There's long hours, overnightguard duties, just everything, 24-hour duties.''   Ms. Beekman said she would consider staying in the Army only ifshe were based near Tacoma, Wash., where her husband moved inOctober to take a job.   ``I've been a single parent since the first of October,'' shesaid. ``I just had a hard time with it.''   Ms. Beekman said other women at the base have been dischargedbecause they had babies, but she doesn't feel she has been singledout. She said the Army has a shortage overseas in her specialty ofgraphics illustration.   The Army and other services offer pregnant women in uniform theoption of leaving the military before the baby is born. Otherwise,they must apply for a hardship discharge, which can be granted incase of a death in the family, a need to support family members, anda variety of emergencies.   Of the 250,000 women on active duty in all four branches lastyear, 4,815 left the service because of pregnancy and 855 gothardship discharges, said Maj. David Super, a Defense Departmentspokesman.   Ms. Beekman's lawyer, Kenneth E. Labowitz, said his client wouldhave to leave her baby with her husband or mother if she is sent toSouth Korea.   ``I've been a good soldier. I've never been in trouble,'' Ms.Beekman said. ``I don't think my child should be punished for amistake I made.''</TEXT></DOC>
