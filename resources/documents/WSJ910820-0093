Both provisions -- known as exclusions-exempt insurancecompanies from paying claims against directors and officersof failed thrifts. An intermediate state appellate courtruling last year -- the first state appellate court opinionto address the issue -- sent shock waves through theinsurance and Sandamp;L industry by voiding the two exclusions.That court ruled on the public policy grounds that thestate's interest in bailing out its failed Sandamp;L industry canoutweigh private rights.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Where the two conflict, private interest must yield topublic good,&quot; the intermediate appeal court ruled.   But in a 40-page opinion, Maryland's Court of Appeals, thestate's highest court, reversed that reasoning which, itsaid, was appealing in &quot;in the abstract,&quot; but so sweepingthat it could imperil all exclusionary provisions ininsurance contracts.   The decision was a victory for insurance companies. Thecase had been closely watched because almost all liabilitypolicies for directors and officers of thrifts contain bothexclusions. Both have been crucial in limiting the exposureof insurance companies for the negligence of Sandamp;L officersblamed for the collapse of thousands of thrifts nationwide.   One provision, known as the &quot;regulatory exclusion,&quot;cancels insurance coverage when federal regulators takeaction against a thrift. The other, known as the &quot;insured vs.insured&quot; exclusion, exempts insurers when institutions suetheir own directors and officers.   The case concerned whether American Casualty Co. ofReading, Pa., one of the CNA Insurance Cos. of Chicago,, wasobligated to pay over $300 million in claims arising from thefailure of First Maryland Savings andamp; Loan Inc. in November1985. Had the lower appellate court opinion holding theinsurer liable for the coverage been upheld, &quot;the market forthis kind of insurance would have dried up,&quot; said Thomas S.Schaufelberger, a lawyer at the Washington, D.C., office ofDrinker, Biddle andamp; Reath, which represented American Casualty.   While the Maryland high court ruled that public policyarguments could not be used to void the two insuranceprovisions, the court voided one of the provisions inAmerican Casualty's contract on different grounds. The&quot;insured vs. insured&quot; provision, the court found, wasambiguously worded in this case. For that reason, theMaryland Deposit Insurance Fund, which took over FirstMaryland in 1985, can file an amended claim against AmericanCasualty.   &quot;In the grand scheme of things,&quot; said Neil Dilloff, anattorney for the deposit insurance fund, &quot;we've won one outof two.&quot;   ---   BCCI'S LIQUIDATORS weigh representing bank in criminalcase in Manhattan.   The arraignment of Bank of Credit andamp; Commerce Internationalon criminal charges was postponed until Sept. 19 while thecompany's foreign court-appointed liquidators decide whetherto represent the scandal-ridden bank in the case.   The Manhattan district attorney charged the bank, itsfounder and another executive on July 29 with fraud,moneylaundering, bribery and theft. BCCI Holdings(Luxembourg) S.A. and many of its subsidiaries were closedJuly 5 by regulators in several countries because ofwidespread allegations of wrongdoing.   At the scheduled arraignment in state court in Manhattan,no attorneys showed up to represent the company or the twoindividual defendants, BCCI founder Agha Hasan Abedi andSwaleh Naqvi, the bank's former chief operating officer.Prosecutors are seeking the extradition of Mr. Abedi fromPakistan and Mr. Naqvi from Abu Dhabi.   Kenneth Caruso, an attorney for the liquidators, said thecourt-appointed officials from Britain, Luxembourg and theCayman Islands are reviewing whether to represent the companyin the criminal case. As liquidators, they are responsiblefor preserving the company's assets and thus could beresponsible for defending BCCI against a large fine.   &quot;The authority of the liquidators to appear {for BCCI inthe case} is under review,&quot; said Mr. Caruso, of the New Yorklaw firm Shearman andamp; Sterling. But he added, &quot;The liquidatorswill continue to cooperate with the district attorney'sinvestigation.&quot;   Taking a role in the criminal case could complicate theliquidators' efforts in a related bankruptcy proceeding. Theliquidators have asked the federal bankruptcy court inManhattan to protect BCCI's assets in the U.S. from creditorsand regulators until an international solution to the case isworked out.   In bankruptcy court Aug. 9, the district attorney's officeagreed to a temporary restraining order freezing the assetsafter liquidators assured prosecutors that they wouldn'tinterfere with the criminal investigation. A spokeswoman forManhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau said his officedoesn't plan to take a position on whether the liquidatorsshould represent the company in the criminal case.   Losses world-wide from the BCCI scandal are estimated atmore than $5 billion. The liquidators say the assets in theU.S. have to be frozen to ensure that all creditors andregulators are treated fairly.   ---   LAW FIRM LOSES round in feud over departure payout.   A New York state judge found that two clauses in apartnership agreement of the law firm Milbank, Tweed, Hadleyandamp; McCloy unfairly restrict a partner's right to quit and joina competing firm.   The dispute, involving former partner Kevin R. Hackett,raised an issue of mounting concern to law firms because ofthe increase in partner defections: How far can partnershipagreements go in restricting lawyers' rights to practicewhere they please?   New York's highest court in 1989 voided a clause in thepartnership agreement of Lord, Day andamp; Lord, another New Yorklaw firm, that denied a former partner his share of profitswhen he quit to join a competitor. The court found theprovision was anti-competitive, in violation of New York'sCode of Professional Responsibility.   Milbank Tweed's partnership agreement, redrafted shortlyafter that decision, was slightly different. Mr. Hackett, wholeft Milbank Tweed in January to join the New York law firmFried, Frank, Harris, Shriver andamp; Jacobson, claimed his$666,461 payout was being withheld under terms that requirehim to either retire or work elsewhere for less than $100,000a year.   Those limitations also violate New York's professionalcode by barring Milbank Tweed partners from ever leaving tocompete against the law firm, argued Gerald E. Ross, Mr.Hackett's attorney.   In her opinion, New York state judge Joan B. Loomisagreed, though she stopped short of ordering Milbank Tweed topay Mr. Hackett, a real estate expert, the $666,461. Thatissue, she ruled, must be litigated in a trial. Milbank hadwanted the case to go to binding arbitration.   Mr. Ross said the opinion sends the message that the judgewants the case settled out of court. But Russell E. Brooks,the Milbank Tweed partner representing the law firm, said theopinion leaves unclear exactly what the law firm owes Mr.Hackett, if anything.   Milbank Tweed has not decided whether to appeal thedecision, Mr. Brooks said. He declined comment on anypossible settlement talks.   ---   UNION SUES MYERSON andamp; KUHN for $500,000 in allegedlyfraudulent bills.   The United Food and Commercial Workers affiliate of theAFL-CIO accused the defunct law firm of billing it for&quot;phantom&quot; services and expenses from June 1988 to August1989. Also named as defendants are Harvey Myerson, the lawfirm's founder, and two of his former partners, Daniel Cooperand Michael Smith.   The law firm sought bankruptcy-court protection inDecember 1989 and has been accused by other former clients offraudulent billing.   Attorneys for the defendants couldn't be reached forcomment.   Mr. Myerson, of Key West, Fla., was charged in March infederal court in Brooklyn with racketeering, fraud,conspiracy and obstruction of justice. Prosecutors allegedthat he inflated his bills more than $2.5 million for sixformer clients, including the union. Mr. Myerson has deniedthe charges. Earlier this month he was indicted on additionalmail fraud and conspiracy counts.   In the suit filed in federal court in Manhattan, the unionsaid it paid the law firm a total of $1.9 million from August1988 to August 1989. The suit said the alleged fraud of$500,000 stemmed from bills for fictitious services, falsetime entries for lawyers' hourly fees, and expenses that werenever incurred.   The union, which represents workers in the meat-packing,food-processing and retail industry, is seeking tripledamages under the racketeering law.</TEXT></DOC>
