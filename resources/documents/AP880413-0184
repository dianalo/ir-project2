(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The PTL Network will drop JimmySwaggart's daily television shows if he tries to return to churchand television pulpits May 22, a spokesman said Wednesday.   The network is currently broadcasting Swaggart's show withsubstitute ministers.   ``There's no doubt it is one of our better accounts. It's not adecision that we would make lightly,'' David West of the PTLNetwork in Charlotte, N.C., said in a telephone interview.   However, West said, PTL has a waiting list of other people whowant time on the cable network, which he said reaches an estimated12 million homes.   Last week, the Assemblies of God defrocked Swaggart because herefused to accept a one-year suspension from preaching because ofhis involvement with a prostitute.   Swaggart said Friday that the finances of his church and theJimmy Swaggart Bible College couldn't stand up under a one-yearsuspension. He said he was returning to both his church andtelevision ministries on May 22.   Earl Weirich, with the Christian Broadcasting Network inVirginia Beach, Va., said officials there will decide Tuesdaywhether to continue televising Swaggart's programs.   He said CBN, which reaches an estimated 39 million homes, got amixed bag of calls at the start of the Swaggart controversy.   ``Right now we are receiving very little interest. There are asurprising few letters and phone calls,'' he said.   He said it's a marked contrast to what happened when the networkconsidered canceling a children's show.   ``A while back we talked about cutting off a kids' show on ournetwork and we were flooded with thousands of calls. It was like anavalanche.''   West said Swaggart's television show ``A Study in the Word,'' isshown three times daily on PTL and there is another Swaggarttelecast shown once on Saturday and Sunday.   A cable television official said Swaggart could buy time ondozens of individual television stations to make up for the loss ofa network. However, that would be an expensive and cumbersomeproject, the official said.</TEXT></DOC>
