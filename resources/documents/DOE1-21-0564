In nine of theformer and 15 of the latter, digital subtraction produced better results,in the remainder conventional technique was equally good. The advantagesof digital subtraction are due to the removal of superimposed structuresof the skull. Dose measurements at the level of the lens of the eye showeda greatly reduced radiation dose when using digital subtraction, as comparedwith conventional dacryocystography. Digital subtraction techniques withpulsed radiation and the ability to perform pixel shift is an optimalmethod for performing radiological examinations of the tear ducts andsalivary glands.</TEXT></DOC>
