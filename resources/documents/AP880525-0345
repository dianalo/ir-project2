The regulators, testifying before the Senate Banking Committee,noted two longstanding problems dragging down banking as a whole:shaky loans to Third World countries and bank failures insouthwestern states whose economies are heavily dependent on oil.   ``There are two areas of concern,'' said the comptroller of thecurrency, Robert Clarke, whose office regulates nationallychartered banks. ``But they should not overshadow the fact that thenational banking system remains sound.''   In the troubled southwestern states of Texas, Oklahoma andLouisiana, which accounted for more than half of thepost-Depression record of 184 bank failures last year, ``the worstmay be over,'' he said.   Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., agreed that ``the picture thisyear is by no means gloomy.'' But he warned that the financialdevastation in Texas could be an indication of what lies ahead ifthe national economy turns downward.   ``What haunts me is that Texas today might be the United Statestomorrow if we have a national recession,'' he said.   L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorp., which insures bank deposits up to $100,000, said many banksare prepared to withstand a short recession with few ill effects.   He added, ``The FDIC fund is adequate to deal with any problemswe can forsee in the banking system in 1988.''   By any measure, 1987 was a disaster for the nation's 13,650commercial banks. The industry as a whole recorded a profit of only$3.7 billion on $3 trillion in assets, the worst performance since1933.   The nation's largest banks set aside reserves in anticipation oflosses on loans to Third World countries. Nine of the 10 largestbanks in the nation and 17 of the 25 largest recorded a loss forthe year.   Federal Reserve Board Governor H. Robert Heller said``meaningful progress'' has been achieved on the Third World debtproblem.   ``Leaders in a number of borrowing countries have recognized theneed to restructure their economies,'' he said.   Seidman, in a trip to San Antonio, Texas, last week said thatTexas banks would hit bottom in 1988 and improve next year. He hasbeen predicting that bank failures in Texas should climb from 50 in1987 to 70 this year, but that improvements elsewhere should holdbank failures nationally to about the same level as last year.   One substantial, but known, cloud on the horizon is FirstRepublicbank Corp. of Dallas. In March, the FDIC infused $1 billioninto banks owned by the huge holding company with the idea ofcoming up with a permanent rescue package within six months.   The ailing giant likely will cause the insurance fund, whichstood at $18.3 billion at the end of 1987, to register its firstloss in its 55-year history.   According to an audit of the FDIC released last month by theGeneral Accounting Office, an investigating arm of Congress, bankprofits probably will improve despite a continued high level ofbank failures and ``continuing and long-term'' problems presentedby Third World debt.   Last month, 12 of the 15 largest bank holding companies reportedincreased earnings for the first quarter of this year.   The banking committee hearing today is the second session on thecondition of U.S. financial institutions. The first last weekreviewed the state of savings institutions, where much of Congress'attention has been focused.   Compared with banks, the 3,120 federally insured thrifts are inmuch worse shape as a whole, posting a $6.8 billion loss last year.The Sandamp;L insurance fund has been hard-pressed to cope with mountinginsolvencies.</TEXT></DOC>
