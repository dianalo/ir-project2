The department said wages are rising an average 1.2% in the first year of the 1986 labor contracts. Over the life of the agreements, pay will increase an average 1.8% a year. Both averages are the lowest since the department began issuing the report in 1968.    The previous time workers covered under these agreements bargained over wages, mostly two to three years ago, wage increases averaged 3.5% in the first year and an average 3.2% annually over the life of the contract.    Gains in union wage settlements have been shrinking steadily in recent years. Smaller increases generally reflect continuing pressure on companies and unions to keep wage gains modest. Unions have continued to give ground in wages, fringe benefits and work rules, and nonunion wages have been rising faster than union pay in recent years.    About 2.5 million workers were covered by major agreements reached in 1986, including those in the steel, communications, railroads, food stores, aerospace, construction, health services and petroleum refining industries. The report doesn't cover public-sector workers.    In a separate report, the department said total compensation for private-industry workers last year increased 3.2% after gaining 3.9% in 1985. Total compensation includes wages, salaries and most fringe benefits. For nonunion workers, total compensation increased 3.6% over the year, compared with a gain for union workers of 2.1%.    The department said that nonunion workers in private industry had a wage and salary increase of 3.5% in 1986, compared with 2% for union workers. The year's gain for union workers was the lowest since the department began keeping these statistics in 1976.    In its report on major collective-bargaining agreements, the department noted the dampening effect of lump-sum payments, which are one-time payments often made upon a contract's ratification. The payments are often provided instead of wage increases to help offset wage cuts. Such payments aren't included in wages and thus don't form a base for increases in future years. Two-fifths of the 2.5 million workers covered under big labor contracts settled last year received these payments.    Of those 2.5 million workers, about 1.7 million had average increases of 2.9% the first year of their contracts. But 530,000 had wage freezes and 228,000 workers took first-year pay cuts averaging 9.3%. Subsequent wage increases for certain workers who took first-year wage cuts or freezes will result in a net wage gain averaging 2.7% over the life of their contracts for about 2 million workers.    The department said that contract settlements in non-manufacturing industries accounted for three-fourths of the 2.5 million covered workers. These contracts provided average first-year wage increases of 2% and average annual increases of 2.3% over the life of the contract. By contrast, manufacturing settlements reached last year provided an average wage decrease of 1.2% in the first year and an average annual gain of 0.2% over the life of the contract.    In its separate report on compensation, the department said total compensation for all workers in private industry rose 0.6% in the fourth quarter after increasing 0.7% the previous quarter.    Wages and salaries for these employees increased 0.5% during the final quarter of 1986 after rising 0.7% in the third quarter. The wage and salary index and the broader compensation index aren't seasonally adjusted.    Nonunion workers had a wage and salary increase of 0.7% in the fourth period, the same as their third-quarter increase. Union members fared somewhat worse as their wages and salaries rose just 0.2% in the fourth quarter, compared with a 0.6% gain in the third quarter.    Fourth-quarter wages and salaries for manufacturing workers rose 0.6%, matching the gain recorded in the previous quarter. Those in nonmanufacturing jobs had a 0.5% increase in the fourth quarter compared with a 0.8% rise in the third period. </TEXT></DOC>
