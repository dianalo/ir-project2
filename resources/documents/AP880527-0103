The Westin Hotels Co. of Seattle had managed the Carlton Hotelfor 15 years. It reportedly decided to pull out of South Africabecause of pressure from the anti-apartheid movement.   Hotel guests, including a contingent of travel agents from NorthAmerica and Europe, looked on in amazement as police ordered thechanting protesters to disperse, then moved in with batons to beginthe arrests.   Police, who have authority to declare virtually any outdoorgathering illegal, said 142 men and 103 women were arrested. Theworkers were released several hours later after the hotelmanagement paid $50 fines for each worker. Payment of the finesacknowledges guilt for the gathering.   During the first arrests, some protesters were beaten and flunginto police vans. Other employees _ including cooks in chef's hatsand a doorman in top hat and tails _ voluntarily moved toward thevehicles to be taken to police headquarters.   Westin announced last month that it would withdraw on June 6 asmanager of the Carlton.   Workers carried signs accusing Westin of exploitation and toldreporters that the firm should pay them severance bonuses as partof its disinvestment.   The Carlton, one of the two luxury hotels in centralJohannesburg, is owned by the property division of Anglo AmericanCorp., South Africa's largest conglomerate.   Larry Macartney, the hotel's marketing director, He said theworkers' contracts were with the hotel owners, not with Westin, andwere not affected by the disinvestment. He said the managementwanted to meet with the workers to explain the situation and hearcomplaints.   Before the confrontation with police, the protesters _ includingmaids, bellhops and waiters _ trotted around the block on which theCarlton and an adjoining high-rise office building stand.   Inside the hotel, white employees served breakfast in therestaurant and made beds, while departing guests carried their ownluggage.   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregatedsociety in which South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote innational affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy andmaintain separate districts, schools and health services.</TEXT></DOC>
