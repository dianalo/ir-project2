(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Air Force on Friday delayed theliftoff of a military navigation satellite because electricalrepairs at the launch pad will take longer than officials expected.   June 5 is the earliest the $65 million Navstar GlobalPositioning Satellite can be launched atop its Delta 2 rocketbooster, said Capt. Ken Warren, an Air Force spokesman.   It will be the fifth launch attempt. The Delta 2-Navstar was tohave flown May 20, but bad weather forced three postponements. Afourth launch attempt was aborted Wednesday because of a wiringproblem at the launch pad.   Officials had predicted the circuit would be repaired in timefor a launch May 31, but technicians working at the pad on Fridayfound several aging electrical components that need to be replaced.   ``The components were due to expire soon, so rather than risk aproblem with them later, they decided to change them out,'' Warrenexplained.   Wednesday's scheduled launch was aborted at the last second whena computer shut down the Delta 2's main engine before it couldfire. Experts investigating the incident discovered an electricalproblem that blocked the path of an ignition command sent by launchcontrollers to an engine valve. The valve did not open and starvedthe engine of fuel.</TEXT></DOC>
