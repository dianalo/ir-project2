The justices, without comment, let stand a Texas law that allowsthe use of all necessary corporal punishment, short of deadly force,in the state's public schools.   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the Texas law indismissing a lawsuit filed in behalf of two kindergarten girlspaddled severely for ``snickering.''   Other federal appeals courts have made it easier to win suchsuits. For example, the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has ruledin a New Mexico case that, ``at some degree of excessiveness orcruelty,'' such punishment violates constitutional rights.   The justices in 1977 ruled that public school disciplinarymeasures involving physical force never can amount to the ``crueland unusual punishment'' banned by the Constitution's EighthAmendment.   The decision barred students from suing teachers and schooladministrators in federal court over alleged Eighth Amendmentviolations, but left them free to sue in state courts under statelaws.   In the 1977 decision, however, the court said it was leavingundecided whether corporal punishment ever may violate ``substantiverights under the (14th Amendment's) due process clause.''   The case acted on today came from Jacksonville, Texas, where onMay 6, 1987, Crystal Cunningham, 5, and Ashley Johnson, 6, werepaddled twice _ once by their school principal and once by theirteacher.   Mary Sue Bruno, the principal at Westside Kindergarten School,saw the two girls snickering in the hall, and gave each child twoswats on the buttocks with a wooden paddle.   When the girls returned to the classroom, teacher Rosa Cook sawthem still snickering. She took the girls into the hallway and gaveeach three more swats across the buttocks with a wooden paddle.   Each girl missed six days of school. The lawsuit filed in theirbehalf said the reason for their absence was ``severe pain'' andfear over returning to school.   According to court documents, both girls were taken to a childwelfare office where social workers who examined the paddlingbruises said the two had been subjected to child abuse.   The federal lawsuit, seeking monetary damages, alleged that Ms.Bruno, Ms. Cook and other school officials violated the girls'constitutional rights with conduct ``excessive, brutal,disproportionate to the circumstances (and) shocking to theconscience.''   The suit said the paddlings violated the girls' due-process andequal-protection rights.   A federal trial judge threw out the suit, relying on past 5thCircuit court rulings that corporal punishment generally does notviolate any constitutional rights.   The 5th Circuit upheld the dismissal last Oct. 26.   In seeking Supreme Court review, lawyers for the girls citedDepartment of Education studies indicating that 30,000 Americanschoolchildren are physically injured each year ``because of theinfliction of corporal punishment to a degree that requires medicaltreatment.''   The appeal said those studies estimate at ``at least 100,000children develop emotional and learning disabilities from excessiveand inappropriate school punishment each year.''   The girls' appeal was supported in a ``friend-of-the-court''brief submitted jointly by the American Medical Association and theNational Committee for Prevention of Child Abuse.   The case is O'Connor vs. Beavers, 88-1181.</TEXT></DOC>
