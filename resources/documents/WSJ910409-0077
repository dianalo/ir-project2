I'm opposed to a cut because it is badeconomic policy, despite protestations to the contrary, andbecause it is bad politics, especially for Republicans.   Economics first: Most economists continue to believe thecurrent recession will be short and shallow. If theseforecasts hold true, and I hope they do, the fiscal stimulusof the FICA tax cut would hit when the economy is alreadyreturning to full employment and would have little or nopermanent impact on employment levels.</LP><TEXT>   Some conservatives have an almost theological belief thatthe link between unemployment and inflation was severedduring the 1980s. Yet a serious examination of the data showsunemployment and inflation fall simultaneously only whenemployment is below full employment as during the mid-1980s.When employment rises above this level, inflation increases,as it did during the late 1980s. The result is that thefiscal stimulus of a FICA cut, as the economy returns to fullemployment, will result in accelerated inflation.   Even if the consensus forecast is wrong, a FICA tax cut isnot the correct policy response. The correct action would beto loosen monetary policy. This recession was caused byslowed money growth and is best cured by faster money growth.   Leaving the issue of fiscal stimulus aside, there areother, perhaps more important, economic reasons why a FICArate cut is bad economic policy. Reductions in the payrolltax of the size being discussed would dramatically increasethe amount of money the federal government would have toborrow from the public -- by $160 billion to $190 billionover five years. This will deprive private companies ofneeded funds and drive up interest rates and the cost ofcapital, which is critical to the future of the country.   Because the government will have to borrow more, andworkers and companies will save only a fraction of their taxsavings, our abysmal rate of national savings will fall stillfurther. This will reduce the nation's accumulation ofproductive capital. The consequences of this areclear-reduced living standards (from what they otherwisewould be) and an economy less able to support futureretirees.   Furthermore, the FICA tax cut will make the U.S. even moredependent upon foreign sources of capital. The changes inEastern Europe and the Soviet Union, the economicliberalization of Western Europe, and the rebuilding ofKuwait and Iraq will increase the international demand forcapital, making it more expensive for the U.S. to attract theincreased foreign capital it will need because of the lowerU.S. national savings rate.   Additionally, the increase in real interest rates,resulting from the increased federal borrowing, will drive upthe value of the dollar. The higher dollar, while good fortravelers to Europe, will damage our economy while helpingthe economies of Germany and Japan.   Now to the politics: Returning Social Security to apay-as-you-go system is politically risky, especially forRepublicans. The Moynihan proposal cuts tax rates for awhile, but then increases them above current levels to acombined employee and employer rate of 16.2%. Presumably, ifone opposes the current combined rate of 12.4%, one will alsooppose the future rate, but the only choices available willbe to cut benefits, tap the general fund (i.e. higher taxesor spending cuts) or greater borrowing, none of which areappealing.   Worse still is the DeLay Proposal, which does not setfuture rates, but requires Congress to maintain a closeactuarial balance in the trust fund over a 10-year period.Because promised benefits greatly exceed the revenues to theOld Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance fund under theDeLay Proposal, Congress will have to vote for increasedtaxes or benefit cuts within the next five years -- anotherno-win situation for Republicans.   In either case, doubt about future Social Securitybenefits will increase because there will be less money inthe trust fund to pay them. Since Democrats are perceived asbeing better protectors of Social Security than Republicans,Republicans will feel the wrath of the elderly and thenear-elderly at the polls.   Rep.
