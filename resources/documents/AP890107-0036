The lawsuit, filed Friday in U.S. District Court in Brownsville,seeks to reverse Immigration and Naturalization Service rules ofDec. 16 that made it impossible for most asylum-seekers to leavesouth Texas or work while waiting 30 days for approval or denial oftheir claims.   ``In essence, South Texas has been transformed into a de factodetention area and asylum applicants are trapped there,'' says thelawsuit, which was filed on behalf of Central Americans and otherasylum-seekers in the INS Harlingen District at the southern tip ofTexas.   Before Dec. 16, asylum-seekers in Harlingen were allowed totravel to their U.S. destinations to apply for asylum, often Miamior Los Angeles. INS officials said they adopted the new procedure inHarlingen to reduce huge case backlogs in those cities and to curbabuses of the system that delayed processing for legitimate asylumcases.   At least 30,000 Central Americans passed through the area lastyear, according to INS figures. Most of them enter the United Statesillegally in the Brownsville area of the Lower Rio Grande Valley,the nearest land point to Central America.   ``Due to the new policy to process these cases in Harlingen,severe backlogs have been created and hundreds of refugees areforced to sleep overnight on the sidewalk outside the INS office soas not to lose their place in line,'' the lawsuit said. ``Many aresleeping in empty lots and eating from garbage bins. Many aretraveling with small children who also are forced to endure winterelements without shelter.''   The lawsuit names U.S. Attorney General Richard Thornburgh andINS Commissioner Alan Nelson as defendants.   INS officials in Washington declined to comment.   U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela of Brownsville has agreed tohear a motion Monday for a temporary restraining order, said RobertRubin, managing attorney for the Immigrant and Refugee RightsProject for the San Francisco Lawyers' Committee for Urban Affairs.   The order would again allow asylum-seekers to pursue their casesat their destinations, where the attorneys said many have familiesand friends to help them.   The lawsuit accuses the INS of implementing a policy changewithout publishing it in the Federal Register for public comment; ofdenying aliens access to the asylum process and access to counsel;and improperly restricting the right to work.</TEXT></DOC>
