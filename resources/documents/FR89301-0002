This actionwill result in an annual effect on the economy of less than $100 millionand will neither result in a major increase in cost or prices, nor adverselyaffect competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, orthe ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises in domestic or export markets. There is no impact on proposedbudget levels, and funding allocations will not be affected because ofthis action.In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354), NealSox Johnson, Acting Administrator, FmHA, has determined that this actionwill not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities because the proposed regulation changes primarily affectresidential appraisal processing by FmHA staff appraisers.Subpart C of Part 1922 is amended to incorporate internal management changeswhich affect the use of comparable sales data, Marshall and Swift ``SquareFoot Appraisal Form'' form number changed from AP 1007 to 1007, changesincorporated in Form FmHA 1922-8, currently titled ``Residential AppraisalReport'' and renamed to ``Uniform Residential Appraisal Report'', and includingminor changes in appraisal regulation content.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>A proposed rule published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 23406) on June 22, 1988, invited the publicto submit written comments for the Agency to consider with regard to thedevelopment of the final rule. Eight (8) sets of comments were receivedfrom interested persons representing Professional Real Estate AppraiserOrganizations, Professional Surveyors and FmHA employees.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Comments</ITAG>1. One respondent suggested changes to the provisions of andSection;1922.101concerning employee appraisal authorizations versus employee demonstrationof skills and training, prior to a State Director review and delegationof appraisal authority to the employee.The Agency believes that andSection;1922.101 provides State Directors withthe necessary administrative controls and flexibility to institute andestablish an on-going appraisal review and training program which meetsthe overall objectives of the regulation. Therefore, the suggested changeswere not adopted by the Agency at this time.2. One respondent recommended modification to andSection;1922.101(c) relativeto providing photographs of the subject property. Section 1922.101(c) wasmodified and deletes reference to photographs.Section 1922.105(c)(6) sets forth the photographic requirements for thecompletion of all residential appraisals.3. One respondent expressed concern over dwelling repair policy containedin Subpart C of Part 1965 of this chapter versus andSection;1922.101(c) requirementson the completion of residential appraisals on an ``as developed'' basis.The respondent's concern is a loan processing issue under Subpart A ofPart 1944 of this chapter. The comment is appreciated but is beyond thescope of the changes proposed at this time. It is suggested that the respondentprovide comment in accordance with the pending major revisions to SubpartA of Part 1944, which will be published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>as a proposed rule at later date.4. One respondent suggested changes to the definitions of appraisal termscontained in andSection;1922.102.The Agency adopted the suggested change for the definition of depreciatedreplacement cost and modified andSection;1922.102(f) by inserting the words``less deductions for depreciation'' between the words ``cost'' and ``of''in the text. Suggested definition changes on final reconciliation/estimatedvalue, program definition of dwelling size, highest and best use of thesite, including additional definitions presently not contained in andSection;1922.102,were not adopted by the Agency. The provisions of andSection;1922.102 willadequately serve the Agency's residential appraisal process and additionalmodification is not necessary at this time.5. Two respondents suggested changes to andSection; 1922.105 concerning photographs,inspection and property information gathered in evaluating the subjectproperty.Photographs of the subject property are adequately addressed in andSection;1922.105(c)(6) of the regulation. The necessity to require photographswhich provide front, rear and side views of the property will enhance theoverall quality of the residential appraisal process, including off-siteappraisal reviews conducted by the Agency.Realignment and/or consolidation of andSection; 1922.105(c)(4) with andSection;1922.105(c)(2) and andSection; 1922.105(c)(3) versus andSection; 1922.105(b)(3),was not adopted by the Agency. These suggestions will be evaluated andconsidered in the next major rewrite of the regulation.6. One respondent suggested that andSection; 1922.105(a) be revised to stipulatethat information gathered by an appraiser, as defined in andSection; 1922.101(a)for the completion of an appraisal assignment in accordance with the provisionsof andSection; 1922.104(a)(10), andSection; 1922.105(1)(ii) and andSection; 1922.105(3)(i-vii),be provided by a licensed or registered professional surveyor in accordancewith applicable State law.Our Agency believes that andSection; 1922.105(a) does not require additionalrevision at this time. Information required to perform an appropriate evaluationof a residential appraisal assignment is usually provided by the realtor,contractor, seller and/or purchaser involved in the real estate transaction.Expense and procurement of such information is the burden of the partiesassociated with the real estate transaction who are seeking financial assistancefrom our Agency.Legal descriptions (deeds), professional property surveys and additionalsite information is obtained from official Court House records and or otherState and Federal Agencies, to validate the authenticity of the informationwhich is incorporated into the residential appraisal.FmHA appraisers are not authorized to perform professional property surveysin conjunction with their assigned duties while employed by the Agency.In addition, a potential conflict of interest situation would exist inthe event FmHA appraisers were licensed in accordance with applicable Statelaw and permitted to conduct a professional property survey in conjunctionwith a residential appraisal assignment. Therefore, our Agency believesthat the intent of andSection; 1922.105(a) is clear and adequate traininghas been provided to all FmHA appraisers regarding the compilation of documentationneeded to complete residential appraisal assignments.7. Six respondents recommended changes to andSection; 1922.107(a)(1) concerningshort-lived and long-lived depreciation on residential properties.The Agency has modified its regulation in response to these recommendationsto require physical depreciation estimates in structures with an effectiveage of 5 years in lieu of the proposed effective age of 1 year. In addition,the Agency modified the last sentence in andSection; 1922.107(a)(1) to readas follows:``Short-lived and long-lived depreciation schedules will be completed oncomparable properties, provided the effective age is over 5 years and theappraiser gains access into the property to validate the condition andactual age of the short-lived components. If access to the property cannotbe obtained, document accessibility on Form FmHA 1922-12. (Refer to FormFmHA 1922-12, reverse side.)''.8. One respondent recommended changes to andSection; 1922.107(b), relativeto depreciation entries in the sales comparison section of Form FmHA 1922-8and Form 1007.The Agency adopts the recommendation and modifies all references in andSection;1922.107(b) which currently read as ``will be'' to read as ``is also''.9. Four respondents recommended that andSection; 1922.109(a) retain the DistrictDirector exception authority to grant the use of FmHA comparable salesdata. In addition, one respondent expressed concern that the Agency utilizeFmHA financed comparable sales provided appropriate adjustments were madeto reflect financing terms.The Agency decision to grant exception authority at the National Officelevel, as proposed in the regulation, will strengthen the overall internalmanagement of residential appraisals and promote improvement in the managementof the comparable sale data base. FmHA financed comparable sales may beauthorized in accordance with the provisions of the regulations set forthin the proposed rule.10. One respondent recommended changes in andSection; 1922.109(a) concerningthe sequence of adjustments to comparable sales data.The Agency adopts the recommendation to reflect initial adjustments forfinancing concessions, time of sale, location and physical characteristics,in accordance with the chronological order of adjustment categories identifiedon Form FmHA 1922-8.11. One respondent expressed concern regarding andSection; 1922.109(c), whichintroduces the Income Approach used in conjunction with FmHA inventoryproperties classified as ``non-program.''FmHA inventory properties classified as ``non-program' are typically soldto investors for rental purposes. Therefore, the Income Approach whichis incorporated into the FmHA residential appraisal process, will enablethe appraiser to make necessary adjustments for real estate market trendsattributed to income producing properties.12. Two respondents suggested that andSection; 1922.110 accommodate flexibilityin the utilizaiton of the income approach to value, including the finalreconciliation/estimated market value section, when completing non-programresidential appraisals.The Agency believes that Exhibit B, of this subpart, provides adequateguidance and flexibility on the income approach to value on non-programresidential property. andSection; 1922.110(d) was changed to accommodatethe reconciliation of the three approaches to value for non-program residentialappraisals. Additional language was added to this section which reads asfollows:``Non-program property appraisals, utilizing the income approach to valuein accordance with Exhibit B, of this subpart, will have the estimatedmarket value documented in the reconciliation section of Form FmHA 1922-8.Non-program property appraisals which do not utilize the income approachto value due to a lack of comparable sales data will have the final reconciliation/estimatedmarket value derived from the sales comparison and cost approaches to value''.This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistanceunder No. 10.410, ``Low Income Housing Loans (Section 502 Rural HousingLoans).'' For the reasons set forth in the Final Rule related Notice to7 CFR Part 3015, Subpart V, 48 FR29115, June 24, 1983, this program/activityis excluded from the scope of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmentalconsultation with State and local officials.This document has been reviewed in accordance with 7 CFR Part 1940, SubpartG, ``Environmental Program.'' It is the determination of FmHA that thisaction does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affectingthe qualifty of the human environment and in accordance with the NationalEnvironmental Policy Act of 1969, Pub. L. 91-190, an Environmental ImpactStatement is not required.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Parts 1809, 1922, 1944, 1945, and 1965</ITAG>Loan programs_Agriculture, Real property_Appraisals, Rural areas, Loanprograms_Housing and community development, Low and moderate income housing,Rural housing, Home improvement, Low and moderate income housing_Rental,Mobile homes, Mortgages, Subsidies, Agriculture, Disaster assistance, Administrativepractice and procedure and Foreclosure.

The employee's immediate supervisor willrecommend the employee designated to make appraisals after determininghe or she has:(1) Inspected at least two properties not previously used by Farmers HomeAdministration (FmHA) for sales comparison and completed correspondingForms FmHA 1922-12, ``Nonfarm Tract Comparable Sales Data,'' for thosecomparables; and(2) Satisfactorily prepared at least two appraisals on Form FmHA 1922-8,``Uniform Residential Appraisal Report,'' and Form 1007, ``Square FoodAppraisal Form.''(c) <T3>Appraisal report. </T3>An appraisal report is a supportable, defensible,written report as of a specific date by an appraiser setting forth an estimateof the value of a property, along with documentation supporting the valueestimate. The basic principles and methods of appraising real estate outlinedin this subpart, Exhibits A, A-1 and B to this subpart (all available inany FmHA office) will be followed in making appraisals. Use Form FmHA 1922-8for all appraisals made under this subpart. Attach a cost calculation sheet,Form 1007, to Form FmHA 1922-8. The appraisal report will include marketdata on comparable sales of similar properties in the sales comparisonanalysis section. Use three comparable sales if available. A cost calculationbased on a residential cost handbook or building valuation manual approvedby the National Office is required for all appraisals. Appraisals for loanmaking purposes will be made on an ``as developed'' basis. Appraisals forforeclosures, voluntary conveyance, partial release, recapture, etc., willbe made on an ``as is'' basis. Appraisals made in connection with voluntaryconveyance and foreclosure may also contain an additional ``as developed''value documented in the reconciliation section of Form FmHA 1922-8 if repairsare planned prior to or in connection with sale of the property. When an``as developed'' value is documented in the reconciliation section of FormFmHA 1922-8, a list of the repairs and estimated cost of the repairs mustbe included.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1922.102</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definition of appraisal terms.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Depreciation</T3>_A decline in market value of dwelling and relatedfacilities from the time improvements were constructed to the time an appraisalis made. Depreciation may result from:(1) Physical deterioration, such as wear and tear, etc., to a structureand other site improvements that are subject to deterioration.(2) Functional obsolescence, such as inadequacies or overadequacy due tosize, design, style, age; changes in taste of the general public; the highcost of heating and cooling dwellings that cannot economically be madeenergy efficient, etc.(3) Location/Economic obsolescence is caused by forces external to theproperty; such as changes in use, or poorly maintained properties in theneighborhood, decline in area employment, noise or other pollution, a declinein the purchasing power of potential buyers, etc.(b) <T3>Economic life</T3>_When applied to single family dwellings, the normaltime a dwelling is expected to remain suitable as a residence, taking intoconsideration a normal depreciation rate. This may vary significantly fromthe remaining physical life of the structure. Economic life minus effectiveage equals remaining economic life.(c) <T3>Effective age</T3>_The age of the dwelling taking into account anyremodeling or refurbishment that has been accomplished or is planned totake place immediately and deterioration or abuse of the property thatwill not be included in any planned improvements. Effective age usuallywill be less than actual age when significant refurbishment has taken place,or greater than actual age if the property has deteriorated more than typicalproperties of the same age.(d) <T3>Final reconciliation/estimated value_</T3>The final estimate of marketvalue after weighing the relative significance, supportability, and reliabilityof the market data and cost approaches; the most probable price a propertyshould bring, as of a specific date, in a competitive and open market,assuming the buyer and seller are prudent, knowledgeable and the priceis not affected by undue stimulus such as forced sale or loan interestsubsidy.(e) <T3>Reproduction cost</T3>_The estimated cost of reproducing an exact duplicateor replica of a structure using the same materials, construction standards,quality of workmanship, layout, design, and incorporating all the deficienciesand superadequacies (functional obsolescence) of the subject structure.Reproduction cost less the sum of physical depreciation, functional andeconomic/locational absolescence equals depreciated replacement cost.(f) <T3>Depreciated replacement cost</T3>_The calculated cost less deductionsfor depreciation of replacing a structure of equal utility that conformsto present day standards. Replacement cost may be significantly less thanthe cost of reproducing an older outdated structure or a new structurethat is overbuilt or does not conform to current market standards.(g) <T3>Living area. </T3>(1) For appraisal purposes, living area will includeonly finished area as determined by the exterior dimensions of the dwelling.(2) For dwelling size eligibility determinations, living area is defineddifferently and is calculated as prescribed in andSection; 1944.16, SubpartA of Part 1944, of this chapter.(h) <T3>Leased fee value</T3>_This is the value of the landlord's rights tothe property being leased.(i) <T3>Leasehold value</T3>_This is the value of the tenant's rights underthe lease that can be tranferred or sold to another party.(j) <T3>Residential property</T3>_The site and all improvements to the site,including the dwelling.(k) <T3>Cost calculation manual</T3>_A manual or handbook published on a nationalbasis, approved by the National Office, that is used to estimate the depreciatedreplacement cost of single family residential structures and other siteimprovements.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1922.103</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">[Reserved]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1922.104</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Influences on value.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Factors to be considered. </T3>(1) <T3>Location. </T3>Location is one of the greatest influences on real propertyvalue. A location near railroads, commercial or industrial plants, landfills,cemeteries, airports, etc., or too distant from employment opportunitiesmay adversely affect a residential property value, whereas a location ina quiet residential area near good employment, schools, shopping, publicservices, etc., may enhance property value.(2) <T3>Supply and demand. </T3>If the market area has an oversupply of residentialproperties and/or building sites for sale or depressed economic conditionsexist, a negative effect on property value will normally be observed. Whenthe supply of residential properties or suitable building sites is shortand/or the general economy is good, a positive effect on residential propertyvalues may be observed.(3) <T3>Replacement cost. </T3>Cost does not directly create or maintain value;however, cost does have an influence on value and will be considered whenestimating value of improvements to a site.(4) <T3>Highest and best use of the site. </T3>The site and the improvementsto the site will be valued separately. However, for loan making purposes,the value estimate of the site will not exceed its value as a residentialsite, based on market data on actual sales of similar residential sitesin the area. For other than loan making purposes, when an alternate useof the site indicates a site value greater than the value of the improvedsite, the higher value will be used.(5) <T3>Accrued depreciation. </T3>This is a combination of physical deterioration,functional and economic/locational obsolescence.(6) <T3>Use restrictions. </T3>Easements, rights-of-ways, subdivision covenants,zoning, and deed restrictions, etc., affect value.(7) <T3>Utilities. </T3>Availability, reliability, quality of utility serviceand cost to obtain suitable water supply, sewer, gas, electrical and otherutility services affect value.(8) <T3>Taxes and assessments. </T3>Tax rates and other public assessmentsas compared to rates in other similar neighborhoods in the market areaaffect value.(9) <T3>Homogeneity. </T3>Similarities to other properties in the neighborhood;for example, a property overbuilt for the neighborhood in an older or deterioratingneighborhood may have a value less than its replacement cost.(10) <T3>Site. </T3>Topography, size, shape, drainage, general suitability ofthe site and site view for residential purposes and site development inaddition to the dwelling must be considered in estimating the value ofthe site.(11) <T3>Financing. </T3>Terms, availability of funds, interest rates and costof obtaining long-term loans, including but not limited to FmHA RH loans,have an influence on the value of property.(12) <T3>Construction. </T3>Living area, room arrangement, garages, porches,built-in equipment, storage, parking facilities, basement, quality of construction,and ``value in use'' of certain energy efficient and/or solar items affectvalue. Exhibit A of FmHA Instruction 1922-B (available in any FmHA office)will be used when estimating value in use of any component described inandSection; 1944.16(g)(2) of Subpart A, Part 1944 of this chapter.(13) <T3>Street improvements. </T3>Street improvements adjacent to the propertyand the type of roads leading to the neighborhood affect value.(b) <T3>Factors not to be considered. </T3>(1) Amount of existing liens ordebts secured by the property;(2) Proposed sale price or bid amount to build the structure;(3) Amount of FmHA loan requested;(4) Sex, age, race, national origin, color, religion or handicap(s) ofresidents of the neighborhood or community; and(5) Appraisals for voluntary conveyances and foreclosure will not reflectany consideration of a forced sale, unpaid balance of FmHA loan(s), otherliens against the property, or cost of acquisition.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1922.105</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Steps preliminary to writing the appraisal.</ITAG>The appraisal will be made only when sufficient information has been developedto enable the appraiser to properly evaluate the property.(a)<T3> Basic information on property.</T3> As a minimum, the property legaldescription, address, plat, subdivision and/or neighborhood map, tax information,recording information, and complete plans and specifications of any plannedimprovements should be obtained by the appraiser prior to beginning theappraisal.(b)<T3> Analysis information.</T3> The appraiser will consider general economicconditions of the market area and obtain additional information which heor she considers pertinent to the appraisal. The appraiser should examinethe community and the neighborhood before inspecting the site.(1) <T3>Community analysis.</T3> The appraiser needs pertinent informationabout the history and growth of the community. The collection, analysisand interpretation of community data helps the appraiser to determine therelative competitive positon of a property in the total market. A knowledgeof how and why the community grew and an understanding of its economictrends enables the appraiser to better understand the factors influencingthe value of real property. The community factors to consider include:(i) Population_increase or decrease;(ii) Geography_i.e., topography, etc.;(iii) Roads and public transportation service;(iv) Employment wages and other income sources;(v) Medical facilities;(vi) Schools;(vii) Volume of new construction;(viii) Number of homes (new and old) being offered for sale in the marketarea;(ix) Fire and police protection;(x) Availability of suitable building sites;(xi) Shopping facilities; and(xii) Other financing available in the area.(2) <T3>Neighborhood analysis.</T3> Neighborhoods are divisions or sectionsof a community or city which are usually homogeneous in some respect. Neighborhoodscustomarily pass four stages of life: building, static, declining, andrebuilding. In measuring the desirability of neighborhoods, features suchas the number of unoccupied homes, age and condition of nearby properties,etc., should be studied and compared.(3) <T3>Site analysis.</T3> The importance of location cannot be overemphasized.The location of a community, city, or neighborhood to available job opportunities,places of worship, school, medical care, shopping, etc., is as importantas the location of the property within its own neighborhood. Other factorsto consider about the site are:(i) Frontage;(ii) Width;(iii) Depth;(iv) Shape;(v) Total usable area;(vi) Topography;(vii) Hazards, such as being located in a flood plain, subject to localizedflooding, etc.; (viii) View from the site; and(ix) Utilities available. (c) <T3>Inspection of the property. </T3>An inspection of the site and allimprovements to the site will be made at such time and under such conditionsthat the appraiser can adequately evaluate the entire property. In thecase of planned improvements, a thorough evaluation of the plans and specificationsof the improvements to be made should be completed to determine if theimprovements are suitable for the site and any existing improvements.(1) The appraiser, after locating and identifying the property, must checkboundary lines against the plat and legal description. This is essentialin order to be certain the improvements to the site are totally on thesite and do not encroach on adjoining property.(2) When inspecting an existing structure, the appraiser will determinethe condition of the structure, and estimate depreciation and cost to repairindividual items he or she determines need repair or replacement in orderfor the structure to meet minimum property requirements and FmHA thermalstandards. The appraiser will determine the total living area, storage,basement, and parking area by actual measurements made during the inspectionof an existing structure; for proposed construction, measurements willbe made from the building plans.(3) If the house is under construction or less than one year old and anindividual water or sewage system is involved, include a certificationby the builder that the house and any water and waste disposal systemshave been or will be built or installed in accordance with the local buildingcodes, plans and specifications. Evidence of approval by health authoritieshaving jurisdiction in the area also will be included. If the house isone year or more old, the appraiser will require approval of individualwater and/or sewage systems by health authorities or, in a case where noState or local health authority exists, by a person or firm qualified todetermine the adequacy and safety of such systems.(4) If the inspection reveals the property cannot be made suitable forthe FmHA program, an appraisal will not be made.(5) The date the real property is inspected will be the date placed inthe reconciliation section of Form FmHA 1922-8.(6) Photographs of the property will be attached to Form FmHA 1922-8.

Land and improvements to the site such as wells, etc.,do not depreciate but may change in value.(a) <T3>Adjustments for depreciation. </T3>(1) <T3>Physical deterioration. </T3>Any deterioration to a structure or otherimprovement to a site which adversely affects the value of the propertyis physical depreciation. Since all parts of a structure are not expectedto have the same life expectancy, it is necessary to determine the age,suitability and condition of certain major components of the existing structure.Physical depreciation estimates in structures with an effective age over5 years, will be made by estimating depreciation of the short-lived componentsof the property seperately from the long-lived components of the property.The appraiser, as a minimum, will consider the heating and/or cooling system(s),roof covering, floor covering, and built-in or easily removable appliancesas short-lived components and estimate depreciation based on the percentof total economic life which has passed since the component was installed.The appraiser will subtract the replacement cost new of these componentitems from the replacement cost new of the entire structure; then estimatethe physical depreciation of the long lived items in accordance with thedepreciation section of the residential cost calculation manual and ExhibitA to this subpart (available in any FmHA office). The total short-livedand long-lived depreciation equals total physical depreciation. Short-livedand long-lived depreciation schedules will be completed on all comparableproperties, provided the effective age is over 5 years and the appraisergains access into the property to validate the condition and actual ageof the short-lived components. If access to the property cannot be obtained,document accessibility on Form FmHA 1922-12. (Refer to Form FmHA 1922-12,reverse side.)(2) <T3>Functional obsolescence. </T3>Any design or feature of a dwelling thatis not acceptable to the typical buyer in the market area will be identifiedby the appraiser on the inspection visit to an existing dwelling or inthe review of plans and specifications of a dwelling to be built. All itemsaffecting the livability and marketability of the property will be recordedin the appraisal report. The appraiser will measure the value differencein the subject property caused by functional obsolescence by comparingproperties that have sold that do meet the livability and marketabilitydemands of the typical purchaser. The appraiser must be familiar with thetaste and desires of the typical purchaser in the market area in orderto support the estimate of value loss due to functional obsolescence ofa property. Exhibit A to this subpart (available in any FmHA Office) outlinesthe parts of a property and design items to consider when estimating functionalobsolescence.(3) <T3>Economic obsolescence. </T3>Any factor outside the property boundarythat causes real property to be worth less because of its location is aneconomic obsolescence factor. The community, neighborhood and site analysiswill form the basis for making this estimate. The actual dollar adjustmentestimate for economic obsolescence will be based on a comparison of salesprices of similar properties in similar and nonsimilar locations. ExhibitA to this subpart (available in any FmHA Office) explains market data extractionof economic obsolescence and sources of economic trend data.(b) <T3>Accrued depreciation. </T3>The sum of physical depreciation, and functionaland economic obsolescence equals accrued depreciation. Accrued depreciationis also entered on Line 29 of Form 1007 and is also documented on the reverseof Form 1007. Accrued depreciation is also reflected in the sales comparisonsection of Form FmHA 1922-8.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1922.108 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Appraisal of leasehold estate.</ITAG>Prior to making an appraisal for loan making purposes involving a leasehold,the appraiser must determine if the lease complies with the requirementsof andSection; 1944.15(a)(5) of Subpart A of Part 1944 of this chapter. Thevalue of the leased fee will not be estimated under this subpart.(a) <T3>Property as improved. </T3>Estimate the market value of the property``as improved'' as though the property was owned under a good and marketablefee title. Estimate the market value of the site on an ``as is'' basisas if no improvements exist or are to be made or placed on the site andsubtract from ``as improved'' property value.(b) <T3>Rent.</T3> Estimate the amount of rent that customarily is paid inthe area for similar sites leased under similar terms.(c) <T3>Lease acquisition cost.</T3> Where a lease acquisition cost is involved,determine the total annual leasehold cost of the site as if vacant. Inmaking this determination the appraiser will consider the amount of annualrent to be paid under the lease plus the annual loan payment required onthe portion of the RH loan used to acquire the leasehold site. The sumof these should not exceed the amount an applicant would need to pay ona loan to buy a similar site with fee simple title.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example:</T3> Present market value of the site as if owned with feesimple title is $5000.

Information on each comparable sale will berecorded on Form FmHA 1922-12, after inspecting the property. A photographof the comparable sale will be attached to Form FmHA 1922-12. Comparablesales less than one year old with nonsubsidized financing from lendersother than FmHA should be used in the market data analysis. A NationalOffice exception may be granted on a quarterly basis, to permit the useof comparable sales financed by FmHA, provided, the State Director certifiesin writing that nonsubsidized financed comparable sales are not availablewithin a specific geographic location within the State. Documentation tosupport a National Office exception request will include a detailed analysisof the real estate market situation from the County Supervisor, DistrictDirector and the State Office Single Family Housing Appraisal Trainer.Only ``arms length'' sales will be used. Market value of the site shouldbe obtained by using comparable sales data for other building sites soldin the area. Dollar adjustments for differences in financing concessions,time of sale, location and physical characteristics will be made in accordancewith the chronological order of adjustment categories identified on FormFmHA 1922-8. All adjustments to comparables will be based on paired salesextraction, cost estimates and market surveys of value differences. Writtendocumentation used to support adjustments will be attached to Form FmHA1922-8. The cost estimates and market survey methods of making adjustmentsto comparables will be used only when data extracted from paired salescannot be obtained. Comparable sales closest to the subject are the mostdesireable and the best indicator of value, but if comparable sales inthe immediate area are nonexistent, the distance may be increased to thenearest similar communities where comparable sales have occurred.(b) <T3>Cost approach.</T3> A residential cost calculation manual approvedby the National Office will be used in estimating the replacement costof the dwelling and improvements to the site. The cost calculation willbe made in accordance with instructions furnished in the handbook or manualand recorded on a Form furnished by the cost manual supplier or Form 1007.The cost manual contains basic cost adjustment tables for different qualitiesof houses. The quality description which best describes the house beingappraised will be used. Accrued depreciation will be established in accordancewith Exhibit A (available in any FmHA office) and 1922.107 of this subpart.Lot or land value will be estimated and added to depreciated replacementcost of improvements.(c) <T3>Income approach. </T3>To be used in conjunction with inventory propertynon-program appraisals only.
