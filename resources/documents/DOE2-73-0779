Emphases were placed onconfirmation of emissions from large sources and quality control proceduresduring data collection in order to increase confidence in the data base.Financial and contractor support were provided to states identified asneeding resources to meet the data and schedule requirements. The resultswere completely updated 1985 emissions estimates for the criteria pollutantsestablished by NAPAP, representing the most-complete National EmissionsData Systems (NEDS) inventory to date. NAPAP will use the 1985 NEDS asa primary origin of point source data for the 1985 NAPAP Emissions Inventoryof sources thought to be acid-precipitation precursors.</TEXT></DOC>
