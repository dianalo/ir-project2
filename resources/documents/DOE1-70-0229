In the UK, the only potential for commerciallyexploiting geothermal energy has been identified as lying in the creationof very deep, man made, steam producing reservoirs in the hot dry rock(HDR) granite formations found in a number of areas. Consequently theR and D programme is now concentrated on HDR technology. The main researchproject in Cornwall includes resource evaluation, seismic surveying,drilling and logging techniques and equipment, instrumentation and computermodelling. An underlying research programme at various centres aims tosupport the Cornish project and to investigate wider issues relatingto the development and exploitation of HDR technology.</TEXT></DOC>
