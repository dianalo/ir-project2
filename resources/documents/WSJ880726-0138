In an annual address to the Philippine Congress, Mrs. Aquino also said Manila is winning its protracted battle with Communist insurgents and emphasized a populist government agenda giving priority to education, job creation and alleviation of poverty.    The speech reaffirmed the government's privatization program, but the president warned she would scrutinize &quot;the integrity of the procedure and the people involved.&quot; Mrs. Aquino also said Manila will need new bank credits as well as foreign aid to meet existing debt obligations.    The president's speech marked the first anniversary of the country's return to democracy, and it coincided with the start of work on a proposed 228.9 billion peso ($10.88 billion) budget for the fiscal year beginning Jan. 1.    Mrs. Aquino predicted that gross national product this year will grow an inflation-adjusted 6.4%, up from 5.7% in 1987 and 1.5% in 1986. Sharply increased consumer spending and rises in manufacturing output are setting the pace.    Total foreign debt of the Philippines stands at $28.6 billion, and about $2 billion, or 18%, of the proposed 1989 budget will go toward interest payments.    The president promised several steps to sustain economic growth. Among them are reduction of petroleum product prices, incentives for small and medium businesses, further decentralization of the state bureaucracy and an emphasis on rural development spending at the village level. </TEXT></DOC>
