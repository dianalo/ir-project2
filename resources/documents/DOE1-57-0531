Other associated variables investigated include: nucleardenial, general anxiety and fear, and the personal characteristics ofsex, socio-economic status, and academic aptitude. Findings indicatethat children attend to nuclear issues when their parents attend to asignificant degree. Children's hopelessness about the arms race is increasedas parents' worry about nuclear war increases. Children's fear aboutnot surviving a nuclear war increases as parents' worry about survivabilitydecreases. Children who have more general fears also indicated that theyhave a high level of hopelessness, pervasive worry, and much concernabout being able to survive a nuclear war. Children with a high degreeof general anxiety did not indicate high degrees of nuclear fears. Childrenwith high academic aptitude were more knowledgeable about nuclear issuesand expressed more fears about the nuclear threat. Boys demonstratedmore knowledge about nuclear issues than girls, and girls expressed muchmore frequent fear and worry about the nuclear threat than boys. Parentsof lower socio-economic statues (SES) expressed more denial about thenuclear threat and were more pro-military than the higher SES parents.</TEXT></DOC>
