The proposal, which is part of the Treasury Department'splan to overhaul the nation's banking system, would mainlyhurt medium and smaller sized banks, which depend moreheavily on brokered deposits than larger institutions. Ifbrokered deposits are no longer federally insured, thesebanks would be forced to pay higher rates to attractdepositors.</LP><TEXT>   Brokered deposits began in the early 1980s, when WallStreet firms and independent brokers packaged funds frominvestors and placed the money in thrifts and banks, usuallyin bundles of $100,000 or less, that offered the highestinterest rates. The brokers received a fee for the service,and consumers gained access to the best rates around thenation. The practice was also helped banks attract depositorsbeyond their local market.   But the savings-and-loan debacle, which was partly theresult of thrifts paying exorbitantly high rates to attractbrokered deposits, prompted a backlash against federalprotection for such deposits. The 1989 Sandamp;L-bailout law beganrestricting use of the brokered market by weak banks andthrifts. The new bank overhaul bill would end federalinsurance for such deposits entirely.   Wall Street has been lobbying strongly against the plan,which would affect about $80 billion in deposits. Banks,however, have been more divided, mainly because other aspectsof the Treasury proposal worry them more.   Although Washington observers say the proposed ban onbrokered deposit insurance has strong congressional support,its enactment could be delayed because of the uncertainoutlook for the other parts of the legislation.   If the Treasury plan passes, rate wars could develop amongbanks, particularly in such troubled regions as New England,according to Reid Nagle, president of SNL Securities, aresearch firm specializing in banks. Without the brokeredmarket, &quot;banks that need funding would be forced to bid updeposit rates in their own local markets,&quot; he says.   To be sure, most banks would have alternative sources forfunds. James McDermott, president of Keefe, Bruyette andamp; Woods,a bank research firm, says banks could choose to shed assetsrather than pay high rates for new funds, for instance.Officials of some larger banks say they would merely turn tothe institutional market for more of their funds. Theinstitutional market involves certificates of depositexceeding $100,000, which aren't federally insured anyway.   Still, smaller institutions or those with weaker creditstandings would have a hard time attracting funds in thathighly specialized, institutional market. Instead, their bestalternative to continue growing would be to rely on theirlocal markets by offering higher rates than the competition.That, however, could force rival banks to respond, thusdriving up the cost of funds for the entire market.   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. as of Sept. 30 stoodbehind $42 billion in certificates of deposit of $100,000 orless. The agency's data also shows that 29 large banks dependon brokered deposits for 15% or more of their domesticdeposits. But the data does not break down the mix betweeninsured retail brokered-certificates and uninsured brokeredcertificates sold to institutional investors.   Some of the heaviest users of the brokered certificatemarket rely on the institutional market, which would beunaffected by new brokered deposit legislation. Many of thosebanks are so-called nonbank banks, which serve as the homebase for credit card operations that don't have retail branchsystems. They include units of American Express Co.,Citicorp, Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co. and MBNA America Corp.   A spokesman for American Express said its Centurion Bankunit, which the FDIC data show as having nearly 73% of its $3billion in domestic deposits derived through brokers, relieson insured brokered deposits for only 5% of its funding.   Other heavy users, such as Maryland National Bank, Bank ofBaltimore, First Bank, Minneapolis, and Rochester CommunitySavings Bank, say they have not issued brokered certificatesrecently, even though they may still have a large amount ontheir books.   A large number of banks still do rely on insured brokereddeposits. If federal insurance is ended, &quot;our customerswouldn't buy them,&quot; says John C. Qua, a managing director atMerrill Lynch andamp; Co.   &quot;It's typical of the government -- taking actions thatwould have solved the last crisis but are irrelevant now,&quot;says Thomas C. Heagy, vice chairman of the La Salle NationalBank unit of La Salle National Corp., Chicago. He adds thatwithout insured brokered deposits, the source of $800million, or a fifth of its deposits, La Salle National mightsell more bank investment contracts to pension funds andmunicipalities. But that process is more cumbersome.   Some banks are not regular users of the insured brokereddeposits, but enjoy access to that market when they need aquick infusion of funding. At the Bank of Baltimore, forinstance, Jerome P. Baroch, senior executive vice presidentof the $3.5 billion asset commercial bank, notes: &quot;If youwant to increase liquidity quickly, you can't just go out todeposit customers and say, `We'd like $50 million more,please bring it right in.'&quot;   MNC Financial Inc., a holding concern for four largemid-Atlantic region banks including Maryland National Bankand American Security Bank, through November last year soldmore than $5 billion in insured brokered deposits amidworries about a loss in regular deposits. &quot;We had a lot ofearnings problems caused by a fairly significant increase innonperforming assets, and we thought it would be prudent tomaintain a higher level of liquidity as we released adversenews,&quot; explains Peter Gartman, MNC chief financial officer.   ---       25 Banks Most Dependent on Brokered Deposits                                                                                                        Ranking of banks with $1 billion or more in domesticdeposits, as of Sept. 30, 1990                                                      Total                           Brokered    Brokered    Domestic Bank Name                 Deposits    Deposits    Deposits City, State          Pct. of Total       (000)       (000)                                                                                                        American Express Centurion Bank Newark, Del.               72.8     $2,201,835  $3,024,470                                                                                                        Greenwood Trust Co.
