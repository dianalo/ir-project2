After reviewing the situation for several hours, the StateDepartment issued a statement through spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley,saying, ``It is now clear that a military coup d'etat has takenplace in Haiti.   ``The United States government strongly condemns this seriousblow to hopes for democracy in that troubled land.''   Mrs. Oakley also noted that Col. Jean-Claude Paul, a Haitianarmy officer under indictment on drug charges in Miami, appeared onthe platform with Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, when Namphy announced thecivilian government led by president Leslie Manigat had beendeposed and declared himself president.   Manigat, who had taken office Feb. 7, arrived with his family inthe Dominican Republic on Monday, according to military sourcesthere.   Mrs. Oakley said the United States had no advance knowledge ofthe coup, would continue to press for democracy in Haiti and wouldconsult with governments in the region on future steps.   ``We're simply looking at the situation and will decide what todo,'' she said.   Since the removal of Haitian dictator Jean Claude Duvalier inFebruary 1986, the United States has sought the creation of freegovernment institutions and, as Mrs. Oakley put it, ``devotedconsiderable resources to the hoped-for transition to democracy.''   Progress toward democracy has been a condition for restorationof $60 million in direct U.S. aid, which was suspended last autumnduring an election campaign marred by massive violence. The aidremained withheld after the United States said Manigat's electionin January was engineered by military authorities.   Mrs. Oakley said the United States still sought strictobservance of human rights in Haiti, economic progress ``toalleviate the suffering of the Haitian people,'' cooperation on theproblem of narcotics trafficking and ``most important, theestablishment of credible transition to a democratic government ledby civilians in Haiti.''   Meanwhile, the United States issued an advisory to would-betravelers to Haiti to defer non-essential trips to the country``due to the changing political situation and resulting securityuncertainties.''   Mrs. Oakley said there were no reports of American in Haitibeing harmed during the coup.   In Toronto, Canada, where President Reagan was attending theeconomic summit of major industrialized democracies, White Housespokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``We do not know exactly what ishappening or who was behind this coup attempt.''   He said, ``Our information is sketchy and we are still trying tomake sure we know all the facts and details.'' He said the coup didnot come up in the discussions between Reagan and the other leaders.   Reagan, asked by a reporter what was going on in Haiti, said,``We are assessing that right now.''   Ernest Preeg, U.S. ambassador to Haiti from 1981 to 1983, saidthe events in Haiti reminded him of the situation in Panama, wheremilitary leader Manuel Antonio Noriega has resisted U.S. pressureto give way to civilian rule.   ``I think one lesson that we should have learned is that evenwith relatively small, weak, poor countries such as Haiti, theUnited States is not able just to flex its financial _ or whatever_ muscle and make things happen in a certain way,'' Preeg said onCable News Network.   The local power structure in Haiti is willing to buck U.S.pressure, he said.   ``I think that's a factor that has some relationship, somebearing, with recent experience with Panama and its something thatwill be a factor in the months ahead in Haiti,'' Preeg said.</TEXT></DOC>
