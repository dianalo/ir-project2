Keating Jr.'s defenseattorney said he will rest his case without calling a witnessand will tell jurors that prosecutors in California'scriminal case against the former American Continental Corp.chairman never proved that he defrauded investors.   Stephen C. Neal said the prosecution's own witnesses inthe state securities-fraud trial here provided ample evidencethat the 67-year-old Mr. Keating never intended to dupe smallinvestors who lost more than $200 million buying AmericanContinental high-risk, high-yield &quot;junk&quot; bonds, mainly atbranches of the company's Lincoln Savings andamp; Loan Associationbranches.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I am not going to put on any evidence. I believe that thepeople have totally failed to prove the charges against myclient,&quot; Mr. Neal said. &quot;Even if you assume that there wereomissions and misrepresentations -- and I don't concede that-- but even if you do, there is utterly no evidenceconnecting Charles Keating to those.&quot;   The defense was scheduled to formally rest today, after atwo-month prosecution case was presented against Mr. Keating.Closing arguments were scheduled for Tuesday. Unless the jurydeadlocks, a quick end appears in sight to the first criminalcase stemming from Lincoln's collapse, which cost taxpayers arecord $2.6 billion.   Mr. Keating faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted ofsix or more of the 18 counts against him.</TEXT></DOC>
