SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The warm waters of the tropics generate almostdaily clouds and showers, a few of which, for reasons not wellunderstood, grow into some of nature's largest and most dangerousstorms.   These are storms like Hurricane Hugo, which forecasters say mayhit the United States later this week after battering many CaribbeanIslands; like the cyclones that have killed thousands in Bangladesh,and like the typhoons that recently took hundreds of lives in China.   To meteorologists, these are all tropical cyclones, giantwhirling areas of low pressure, winds churning counter-clockwisearound the center and drawing strength from the warm water beneath.   Why do some low pressure areas peter out and others turn intomighty storms?   ``Nobody knows for sure,'' admits meteorologist Rainer Bleck ofthe University of Miami.   But while Bleck says much more study is needed, he was able, in atelephone interview, to describe how these storms strengthen, liveand die.   Like tornadoes and the mid-latitude storms than often generateblizzards in winter, hurricanes are basically regions of lowpressure, the result of rising air.   But tornadoes, powerful and dangerous as they are, are tinycompared to hurricanes. A tornado is local, forming from anindividual cloud in 20 minutes to half an hour, Bleck observed.Hurricanes cover thousands of square miles and take five to six daysto form.   The sun warms the Earth, concentrating its strength near theequator. The resultant heated air expands and rises, creating a ringof low pressure and rain around the globe known as the intertropicalconvergence zone.   Hurricanes form to the north and south of this zone, but due tothe same sort of heating, Bleck explained.   The sun warms the water, some of which evaporates to wet thiswarm rising air, he pointed out. This creates a region of hot, wetair 1,000 to 2,000 feet above the ocean.   The warm, moist air rises as it cools, with the water eventuallycondensing into clouds that form tropical showers and storms.   But at this point a new factor is added: condensing waterreleases more heat into the air, just as humidity condensing on acold glass in summer warms it up.   So the rising air is warmed again, and that's the ``kicker'' forthe storm, said Bleck. It spurs on the formation of clouds byincreasing the lift of the air, drawing in more moisture from belowto provide additional fuel.   At the same time, Bleck explained, the clouds begin to turn,taking some of the Earth's spin as their own, creating thecounter-clockwise turning of the storm.   This is known as the Coriolis effect, turning the stormscounter-clockwise north of the equator, the opposite way to thesouth. It doesn't happen at the equator, but gains strength awayfrom that line.   As the winds get closer to the center of the storm they movefaster, just as an ice skater spins faster when she pulls her armscloser to her body.   For reasons not well understood, a clear eye forms in the middleof the storm as it gains strength, Bleck commented.   Air in this central region is descending, and as a result remainsclear, in contrast to the wall of clouds in the spinning, rising airaround it.   As long as the warm, wet air from tropical oceans is available,it fuels the storm engine, Bleck explained, providing risingmoisture that condenses, releasing more heat to drive the furyonward.   The storms move little on their own, however, he added.   Rather, general winds and upper air currents pull them along,first to the west into the Caribbean or Gulf of Mexico and thenturning north to collide with the United States or follow along theEast coast. The track depends on many things, including the locationof the powerful jet stream thousands of feet above the earth.   That movement is what leads to the death of the storms, Bleckwent on, cutting off their fuel supply either by moving them overland or over cooler ocean waters where there is less evaporation toprovide them a supply of water.   Either way, they then lose strength and break down into a loosemass of storms, still dangerous but without the power of thechurning hurricane circulation.</TEXT></DOC>
