The Army said in a statement released at the Pentagon Thursdaythat it was grounding the 526 choppers as a precautionary measurebecause a cracked retention nut was found on the two helicopters.The grounding, the fourth of the Apache fleet, was expected to lasta few days.   The Apache is the Army's newest and most sophisticatedhelicopter gunship.   Army spokesman Maj. Barry Bomier said no accidents had beenreported because of the problem.   The fleet, based throughout the United States and Europe, wasgrounded twice in 1986 and once earlier this year after an accidentin which a piece of sheet metal struck a gunship's rotor blade.   The grounding will remain in effect until an analysis of thepart is completed at the U.S. Army Aviation Systems Command in St.Louis, Mo. The analysis should result in information to identifythe proper procedure for maintenance crews to follow, Bomier said.   The part, known as the main rotor hub retention nut, holds therotor onto the shaft of the aircraft, Bomier said.</TEXT><NOTE>Unintentionally Automatic Pistol Being Recalled</NOTE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The government says thousands of .22-calibersemiautomatic pistols called Scorpions, which may switch withoutwarning to an automatic function, are being recalled by themanufacturer under an agreement reached with federal authorities.   ``A flawed part used in the manufacture of the Scorpion .22semiautomatic pistol may cause the gun to malfunction, includingturning the semiautomatic into an automatic,'' Bureau of Alcohol,Tobacco and Firearms Director Stephen E. Higgins said in astatement released Thursday.   In a semiautomatic weapon, a separate pull of the trigger isrequired for each shot. In an automatic weapon, one pull of thetrigger can dispatch numerous shots. Congress in 1986 banned salesof automatic weapons made on or after May 15, 1986, to allpurchasers the armed services and law enforcement agencies.   The Scorpion is manufactured by Intratec, U.S.A., a Miami-basedfirearms firm, according to ATF spokesman Jack Killorin.   The company says it has sold about 20,000 of the guns and has anadditional 27,000 in a warehouse. The ATF will supervise the recalland repair to make sure the guns are working properly before theyare allowed back on the market, ATF spokeswoman Dot Koester said.</TEXT><NOTE>Rep. Oakar Questions Navy Decision on USS Iowa Skipper</NOTE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A congresswoman is questioning the Navy'sdecision to make the skipper of the USS Iowa eligible for anothermajor command in light of inquiries into the battleship blast thatkilled 47 sailors.   Rep. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio, said Thursday that she was askingNavy Secretary Lawrence Garrett III to explain the ``allegedselection'' of Capt. Fred P. Moosally for sequential major command.   The Navy investigation concluded that gunner's mate ClaytonHartwig of Ohio ``most likely'' caused the April 19 explosion byinserting some type of detonator between bags of gunpowder in oneof the ship's 16-inch guns.   Members of Congress, Hartwig's family and shipmates havecriticized the report. Oakar has asked the General AccountingOffice, the investigative arm of Congress, to review the Navy'sfindings.   The Navy screening board that took the action on Moosallyincludes Rear Adm. Richard Milligan, who headed the service'sinvestigation into the explosion, Oakar said.   ``I realize that consideration and possible selection of Capt.Moosally does not commit the Navy to consider him for sequentialmajor command, but I question the propriety of such action whilethere are several congressional and Navy investigations ongoing,''Oakar said.</TEXT></DOC>
