H. R. Riggs HonoluluandM;For better betas, try LaserGreek from Linguist's Software.andP;  It doesn't havethe range of mathematical symbols that Apple's Symbol font has, but it doeshave all the Greek letters, uppercase and lowercase, in italic, bold,superscript, subscript, outline, shadow, and underline.andP;  It includes screenfonts in 10-, 12-, 20-, 24-, 40-, and 48-point sizes, so you can readcharacters on the screen easily.andP;  It costs $99.95 from Linguist's Software,P.O.andP;  Box 580, Edmonds, WA 98020-0580; (206) 775-1130.andM;Printer AuditingandM;We are looking for a program to record the elapsed time and the number ofpages of documents printed from our 16 Mac IIs and SEs connected to aLaserWriter II, and also to record which user did the printing.andP;  Do you knowwhere to find one?andP;  Dr.andP;  Esterman Leon Rehovot, IsraelandM;The AppleShare Print Server can perform all these functions, but it ties up aMac (unless you have an AppleShareFile Server, with which it can runconcurrently).andP;  The PrintServer costs $299 from Apple dealers and is partnumber M0576.andM;Check out LaserCount, a time- and page-count tracking system for LaserWriterand Linotronic typesetters from LaserCount Systems, Inc., 103-A Blue RidgeTrail, Austin, TX 78746; (512) 327-2778.andP;  It's $285 per printer.andP;  You run itsSystem Administrator program to set up accounts and passwords, which arestored in the printer's memory (up to 200 accounts on a LaserWriter IINT),and then you install a startup program on each Macintosh on the network.andO;When a Mac starts up, it asks for an account name and password and won't letthe Mac run until a valid password is entered.andP;  It then logs the elapsed timeof each Mac and the number of pages it prints.andP;  The system-administrationprogram can retrieve this information, tabulated by account name.andP;  You canassign accounts either to individual users, who can then move from Mac toMac, or to workstations.andM;Extracting CD Audio DataandM;I have an extensive library of audio compact discs, and I'd like to catalogthem, probably in a HyperCard stack.andP;  However, typing in all of the albumtitles, song titles, and other information would take time that could bebetter spent elsewhere.andM;I know that a CD contains more than music information, such as track and timeinformation.andP;  Is there any text information that a CD-ROM player can read?andO;It would make things so much simpler if all I had to do was to put in thedisc, click on a button (with proper scripting), and end up with a new cardwith lots of information about the disc.andP;  David A. Higgins Garden City, MIandM;There's only a little more than music on the average audio CD.andP;  Each CD has aunique ID, an index of the number of tracks, and the duration (in minutes andseconds) of each track.andP;  There isn't any of the alphanumeric information youwant, such as the album or song titles.andP;  (New formats such as CD+G or CDV areadding graphics and video, but those discs are pretty rare.)andM;Last March Apple announced its CD Audio ToolKit for HyperCard that canextract what information there is.andP;  So with the proper scripting, you cancollect the number of tracks and the running time and automatically identifya CD whenever it's inserted.andP;  The HyperCard CD Audio toolKit should beavailable through the Apple Programmer's and Developer's Association (APDA)this fall.andP;  APDA can be reached at (800) 282-2732.andM;Sound and Fury on the SE/30andM;Will screen savers such as Pyro! work with version 6.0.3 of the Macintoshsystem software, which is included with the new Macintosh SE/30?andP;  Will bothMac- and Mac II-specific software (such as Studio/8) run on the SE/30, orwill it be one or the other?andM;MacUser's article on the SE/30 in the March '89 issue states that &quot;Appleknows what it's doing in promoting the SE/30 as a music workstation.&quot;andP;  TheSE/30 has a four-voice stereo Apple Sound Chip.andP;  I assume this means it hasfour voices.andP;  But the Apple IIGS has 15 voices!andP;  I don't understand how thesound could be so much better on the SE/30.andP;  Jonathan Lockie San DiegoandM;As to the system-software issues, 6.0.3 has no changes that will affect mostsoftware.andP;  There are some minor bug fixes and some extensions to help theSE/30 and IIcx identify themselves on networks, but no new software features.andM;What the SE/30 does have over the original SE is most of the Mac IIextensions (such as Color QuickDraw) and the 68030 microprocessor.andP;  Thismeans that the SE/30 can run the software that requires these features.andP;  Forexample, Caere's OmniPage software needs the special instructions in the68020 and 68030 in order to do really fast optical character recognition.andO;Although it's labeled &quot;Macintosh II only,&quot; it'll run on the SE/30.andM;But the SE/30 is not a complete Macintosh II.andP;  It doesn't have NuBus, and itsbuilt-in display has only one bit per pixel (black and white).andP;  So softwarethat requires NuBus cards or gray-scale or color displays (Studio/8 andImageStudio among them) won't run on the SE/30.andM;You're right that the SE/30 has four-voice stereo sound circuitry just likethe Mac II's while the Apple IIGS has 15 voices.andP;  But comparing the two islike comparing the Beatles to the Count Basie Orchestra:  They do differentthings and require different kinds of effort to get them going.andM;The Macintosh has a lot of versatile software (called the Sound Manager) torun the Apple Sound Chip.andP;  It lets an application create sounds with software&quot;synthesizers&quot; that are then played through the chip.andP;  The sounds can besimple or complex waveforms or even digitized sound samples.andM;But the Sound Manager doesn't have to use the sound chip.andP;  It can beconnected to outside circuitry, such as a MIDI interface, and sendsound-generation commands to an external musical instrument, such as asynthesizer or sampler.andP;  So in the Macintosh, the application has greatflexibility, even though the main-board hardware is limited to four voices.andM;In the apple IIGS, the Sound Manager does much less -- it's just a simplesoftware interface between the application and the 15-voice EnsoniqSynthesizer chip.andP;  The application has to do more work, and it's lessversatile; if the application wants to talk to MIDI, it has to do thatitself.andP;  But if you choose, it can use all 15 voices simultaneously andcreate some great sounds.andM;So they're different.andP;  The SE/30 is a more versatile musician's workstationbecause of the architecture of the Sound Manager as well as the higher-levelapplications (such as Coda's powerful but intimidating Finale -- see &quot;Measurefor Measure&quot; in this issue) written for it.andP;  But there's always room for theApple II family to be better at something.andM;An External Drive with the IIandM;I would like to use my Apple 800K External Drive with my Macintosh II.andO;Cutting Edge claims that its 800K External Disk Drive can be used with allnew ROM Macintosh computers (512KE and later).andP;  Cutting Edge explains thatusing a ribbon cable and connecting the DB-19 connector to the motherboardand the other end to the inside of its disk drive is an easy procedure.andP;  Isthis so?andP;  how easy is it&quot;  How about my Apple 800K external drive?andP;  Shelly C.andO;Bernstein, M.D.andP;  Newton Centre, MAandM;The wiring of an external drive to the internal connector is relativelysimple and doesn't require opening the drive itself.andP;  The following techniqueshould work with both Apple and third-party drives because it essentiallyemulates the wiring of the external-drive port on the compact Macintoshes.andM;You'll need a DB-19 socket, a few feet of 20-conductor ribbon cable, a 20-pinribbon header, a crimping tool, a soldering iron, wire strippers, and finerosincore solder.andP;  It might be a good idea to have somebody else do this foryour, especially somebody who can wield a soldering iron and who has wiredribbon cables before.andP;  You can get most of these supplies at an electronicsstore, although DB-19 connectors are hard to find.andP;  One good source for bothparts and custom cables is Redmond CAble, 17371-A1 N.E.andP;  67th Court, Redmond,WA 98052; (206) 882-2009.andM;Crimp one end of the ribbon cable to the header, with the red indexedconductor connecting to pin 1 and the cable exiting to the keyed side (withthe rectangular lump in it).andP;  Then separate (down to about an inch) and strip(to an eighth of an inch) the 20 conductors on the other end and solder themto the tabs on the back of the DB-19 socket in the order shown in Figure 1.andM;Open the Mac and plug the ribbon header into the main board, where thebuilt-in drive plugs in.andP;  Remove the rightmost NuBus shield and expansionslot cover and thread the cable through it.andP;  Now plug the external disk driveinto the socket, and you're ready to go.andM;When hacking hardware, make sure you know what you're doing, and don't blameus if you fry your Mac.andP;
