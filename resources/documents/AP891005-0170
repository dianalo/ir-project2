Gorbachev makes his promised cuts inconventional military forces, the International Institute forStrategic Studies said Thursday.   ``The situation is already in the process of significantchange,'' the institute said in The Military Balance 1989-90, itsannual survey of military forces. ``The unilateral reductions will,once complete, virtually eliminate the surprise-attack threat whichhas so long concerned NATO planners.''   After the cutbacks, it would take the Soviets one to two weeksto marshal the forces for an attack, institute director FrancoisHeisbourg told a news conference Wednesday.   ``In shorthand, that translates as no surprise attack,'' hesaid. Soviet withdrawals from Eastern Europe now under way includeunits needed in lightning attacks, Heisbourg added.   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, carried a lengthydispatch on the institute's report.   In a speech to the United Nations on Dec. 7, Gorbachev promisedto reduce the Soviet armed forces by 500,000 troops and toeliminate 10,000 tanks, 8,500 artillery pieces and 800 combataircraft by 1991.   The institute said it discovered, because the Kremlin answeredits questions for the first time, that the Soviet Union had 6,700more main battle tanks than previously estimated, bringing thetotal to about 60,000. It said the additional tanks probably werein storage.   The Soviet-led Warsaw Pact's huge tank force is a key element inwhat the 16-nation NATO alliance calls its overwhelming numericalsuperiority in conventional forces. The institute's new surveyshowed NATO with 34,400 tanks and the Warsaw with 78,200.   Of these, NATO has 21,900 tanks deployed and the Warsaw Pact58,500, the survey said.   Troop levels, excluding reserves, were shown as about equal inthe area, with NATO having 2.24 million active service personnelcompared with 2.3 for the Warsaw Pact.   The survey said the long-range strategic nuclear arsenals of theUnited States and Soviet Union remained ``in rough parity.''   Institute officials said their estimates of conventional forcesdid not include Soviet cutbacks since Gorbachev announced theplanned reductions.   Heisbourg gave no figures for withdrawals so far but said theSoviets have begun pulling out crack units and that Moscow had saidfrontline divisions deployed in East Germany would be withdrawn.   ``Some of these divisions are divisions which any NATO plannerwould like to see removed,'' Heisbourg said., but he cautioned thatthe Soviets would be capable of ``major sustained offensiveoperations'' even after the promised cutbacks.   He said the Warsaw Pact had been weakened by political upheavaland disagreement, with Poland and Hungary implementing sweepingreforms and East Germany sticking to communism. Both reformers andhard-liners have maintained military ties with Moscow but relationsare strained, Heisbourg said.   ``It would be a very hardy analyst who would consider Hungaryand East Germany still to be allies in any meaningful sense,'' hetold the news conference.   The institute is an international non-governmental center forresearch on security and arms control. It is financed by privatefoundations, membership fees and sales of its publications.</TEXT></DOC>
