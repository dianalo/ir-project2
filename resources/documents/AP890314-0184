RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A Supreme Court justice Tuesday refused to leta strike against Eastern Airlines spread to a Philadelphia-areacommuter railroad that carries 90,000 passengers a day.   Justice William J. Brennan left intact a court order blocking asympathy strike by the railroad workers in support of the Machinistsunion strike against Eastern.   Brennan rejected a request by rail unions seeking to strike theSoutheastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA).   He said the rail unions failed to establish that there is areasonable probability four justices on the high court would vote tohear arguments in the case _ one of the grounds that could have beenthe basis for suspending the lower court order.   U.S. District Judge Franklin Van Antwerpen in Philadelphia issueda preliminary injunction on March 9 prohibiting the rail unions fromhonoring pickets set up by Eastern machinists at SEPTA facilities.   Van Antwerpen said, ``It takes little imagination to project theharm and danger which would immediately flow from the cessation of90,000 passenger rail trips each day.''   A similar court order in New York City has prevented the Easternstrike from spreading to commuter railroads in the New Yorkmetropolitan region.   The Eastern Airlines machinists are said to be trying to use suchsympathy strikes, or secondary boycotts, to prompt President Bush orCongress to take action in the walk-out against the airline.   The threatened disruption of the nation's transportation systemcould pressure Bush into appointing a special board to mediate thedispute during a 60-day cooling-off period. Congress also has thepower to impose a settlement recommended by such a board.   The Machinists union said that sympathy strikes, rarely used inthe transportation industry, are legal under the Railway Labor Actof 1926.   The Supreme Court ruled in 1987 that courts may not bar railworkers from extending a labor dispute to other railroads notdirectly involved in the dispute.   But SEPTA officials said contracts with their workers requirethat disputes be ironed out through arbitration.   The officials said the strike is prohibited by SEPTA's contractwith its workers and because the Railway Labor Act bars strike over``minor disputes.''   Judge Van Antwerpen, in issuing the injunction against therailway workers, ordered the unions and SEPTA to proceed toarbitration.   Meanwhile, the Bush administration reiterated its oppositionTuesday to legislation that would require the president to appointan emergency board to recommend a solution to the walkout. The Houseis scheduled to consider the bill Wednesday.   Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner released a letter hehad sent Monday to House members, warning them ``the presidentstrongly opposes this bill, and his senior advisors would recommendthat he veto this or any similar bill.''   The administration says it believes there is no emergency thatwould justify the appointment of such a board, and that even if onewere named, Eastern's management and workers are so bitter thatlittle would be accomplished.   Congressional supporters, mainly Democrats, say the board mighthelp the two sides reach an agreement. The measure is expected topass the House, but it is considered largely symbolic because of itsquestionable fate in the Senate and Bush's likely veto.</TEXT></DOC>
