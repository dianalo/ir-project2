Police said two people were killed and 17 wounded in rocket,howitzer and mortar duels across the Lebanese capital, which isdivided into Christian and Moslem sectors.   The latest casualties increased the toll to 847 killed and 2,528wounded since March 8, when fighting broke out between Christianarmy units under Gen. Michel Aoun and Syrian troops based in Lebanon.   The violence came on the eve of a new effort by three Arabnations to end the violence in Lebanon. King Fahd of Saudi Arabiasaid he was optimistic about a settlement.   The Syrian barrage on the Christian region escalated when theship Princess-Hand entered Lebanese territorial waters off the coastof Byblos, 19 miles north of Beirut.   Syrian gunners used radar-controlled 130mm howitzers to shell thecoastline, and scores of shells exploded around the ship, said apolice spokesman, who refused to be named in line with standingregulations.   The Princess-Hand anchored safely at the port of Jounieh an hourlater, and the fighting eased into sporadic exchanges.   The ship's nationality and agents were not known.   The police spokesman said the newsprint was imported by threenewspapers operating in the 310-square-mile enclave. He did notidentify the papers.   The Christian enclave, home to 1 million people, has beenbesieged by Syrian and allied forces more than six months.   Syrian gunboats have seized several ships trying to defy theblockade and head to Christian waters, and 22 vessels have been hitby Syrian fire, Aoun's Christian government reported.   Fourteen sailors have been killed and five wounded, by officialpolice count.   King Fahd was one of three Arab leaders who suspended apeacemaking mission assigned to them two months earlier at an Arabsummit in Morocco.   They implicitly blamed Syria for the deadlock because it refusalto agree to a timetable for withdrawing its 40,000 soldiers fromLebanon. The Syrian army entered Lebanon in 1976 under an ArabLeague mandate to quell the civil war.   Fahd's comments came on the eve of a meeting in Jiddah by theforeign ministers of Algeria, Morocco and Saudi Arabia Jiddah torevive the peacemaking effort.   The king told the newspapers Okaz and Bilad that ``all parties tothe conflict are more convinced that efforts must be continued tosearch for the suitable solutions.''   He also said ``all the new elements raise hope that thetripartite committee will find fertile ground to move for peace.''   Lebanese newspapers and Shiite Moslem leader Nabih Berri alsopredicted there soon would be a truce.   The independent An-Nahar newspaper said Aoun has agreed to theidea of forming a team to monitor the import of weapons by thewarring factions in Lebanon. His rejection of the proposal hadstalled peace efforts.   Iraq, Syria's main Arab rival, has been Aoun's main backer, andthe Syrians insist on an observation force to block Iraqi armsdeliveries by sea.   Berri, speaking from Damascus, told the United Arab Emiratesnewspaper Al-Bayan: ``The Arab committee will achieve progress inreaching a cease-fire.''   The fighting broke out after Aoun blockaded the private portswith which Moslem militias finance their operations in the14-year-old civil war. Syria then blockaded the Christian enclave.   Aoun pledged a ``war of liberation'' to drive out the Syrians.</TEXT></DOC>
