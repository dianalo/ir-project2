Irvine, Calif.-based Fluor said it will sell the gold operations to a unit of Dallhold Investments Pty., a Perth, Australia-based holding company controlled by Mr. Bond and his family. Fluor said it expects to complete the sale by Oct. 31.    The announcement comes as an apparent blow to Fluor's former president and chief operating officer, John A. Wright, who resigned his corporate posts last month to pursue a buyout of St. Joe Gold. Since resigning those posts, however, Mr. Wright has continued to serve as chairman and chief executive of St. Joe Minerals Corp., the parent of St. Joe Gold. Mr. Wright couldn't be reached for comment.    As previously reported, the management group led by Mr. Wright was one of more than 20 potential buyers that had expressed interest in St. Joe Gold, Fluor said. Fluor announced its intention to sell St. Joe Gold earlier this year. The company acquired St. Joe Minerals in 1981 for $2.34 billion.    David S. Tappan Jr., who assumed the positions of president and chief operating officer of Fluor after Mr. Wright's resignation, wouldn't elaborate on why Mr. Wright's bid was rejected. He said only that Mr. Bond's proposal was accepted &quot;first and foremost because of the purchase price -- in cash . . . and the timeliness and speed of the transaction.&quot; He said the proposed sale would result in a $400 million pretax gain for Fluor, with proceeds to be used to pay debt and for investment purposes.    Mr. Tappan added that Mr. Bond has said he doesn't intend to sell St. Joe Gold assets, and in fact plans to accelerate development of the gold properties. Mr. Bond's Dallhold is currently the second-largest gold producer in Australia.    Mr. Bond, an America's Cup yachting champion, also has interests in beer brewing and real estate. Last August, he sold Screen Entertainment Ltd., Britain's largest film production and entertainment concern, along with other assets to Los Angeles-based Cannon Group Inc. for $270 million.    In June, Fluor retained Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. and S.G. Warburg andamp; Co. to assess the value of its gold operations in view of the recent increase in gold prices. Fluor, after losses in recent years, has said it intends to focus on its core engineering and construction businesses and reduce its interest in natural resources operations.
