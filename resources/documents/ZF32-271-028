 it squarely positions OS/2 ExtendedEdition within the realm of standards-oriented distributed computingenvironments (DCEs).andP;  The new TCP/IP Version 1.0 for OS/2 offers programminginterfaces to Berkeley sockets, the Network Computing System, Kerberos, and aRemote Procedure Call that provides the complete set of remote procedureenvironments of Sun and HP/Apollo (Sun's RPC and the HP NCS RPC) in additionto support for TCP/IP applications.andM;TCP/IP for OS/2 interoperates with IBM's TCP/IP on VM, MVS, DOS, AS/400,System/88, and AIX, as well as other TCP/IP platforms.andP;  In addition, the newsoftware supports the development and deployment of distributed networkapplications.andP;  IBM plans to release the TCP/IP package this month, at a costof $675 per workstation.andM;The new program supports connection over IBM Token-Ring, IEEE 802.3, orEthernet Version 2 LANs.andP;  It incorporates support for TCP, IP, UDP (UserDatagram Protocol), and ICMP (Internet Control Messaging Protocol) as well asthe following functions.andM;TELNET.andP;  TELNET support includes both client and server support, with fullemulation of 3270, VT100, and ANSI terminals.andP;  An OS/2 user can access infull-screen mode host applications supporting 3270 or VT100 terminals.andP;  Theclient runs either in a Presentation Manager window or in full-screen mode.andO;Multiple copies of TELNET can run concurrently, allowing the OS/2 user toattach to multiple TELNET servers.andM;SNMP.andP;  Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) agent support providesmanagement communications between the OS/2 system and an SNMP monitor.andP;  TheOS/2 package also have a subset of SNMP monitor support that uses the GETfunction to allow the OS/2 user to interrogate other SNMP agents for theirManagement Information Base data.andM;SMTP.andP;  Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is supported as both client andserver.andM;REXECD AND REXEC.andP;  The Remote Command Execution Daemon (REXECD) and theRemote Execution Client (REXEC) allow a user of another OS/2 system toexecute an OS/2 command from the remote TCP system.andM;KERBEROS.andP;  TCP/IP for OS/2 provides a programmatic interface to the Kerberoslibrary.andP;  Kerberos, developed under MIT's Project Athena, provides anauthentication service in a distributed computing environment.andP;  Aclient/server application pair must use the Kerberos libraries andticket-granting service to use DCE resources.andP;  Services include:andM;* Kerberos Application LibraryandM;* Encryption LibraryandM;* Database LibraryandM;* Database Administration ProgramandM;* Administration ServerandM;* Authentication ServerandM;* Database Management and user programsandM;RESOLVER.andP;  The Resolver allows a client to communicate with a user-supplieddomain name server to obtain the network address associated with a lost name.andM;ROUTING.andP;  TCP/IP for OS/2 provides an IP router function that can run on anondedicated machine.andP;  TCP/IP for OS/2 uses the Routing Information Protocol(RIP) to listen to routing information and to update the routing tablesthrough the ROUTED server.andM;PROGRAMMATIC INTERFACES.andP;  This is one of the highly interesting areas of thenew TCP/IP announcement.andP;  IBM is offering programmatic interfaces to Berkeleysockets, RPC, NCS, and Kerberos.andP;  The OS/2 socket library consists of thenetworking components of the Berkeley library.andP;  The application protocolsdelivered with this package use this socket library.andM;IBM also is avoiding the sometimes heated warfare over which RPC mechanism tosupport by offering interfaces to both the Sun RPC and the Hewlett-PackardNCS RPC.andM;OTHER FEATURES.andP;  The new package also provides client and server line printersupport, allows users to send messages to and receive messages from otherusers interactively, and allows a user to collect machine statistics.andM;IMPLICATIONS.andP;  The Open Software Foundation has begun a process to define astandard DCE, and IBM is part of the DeCorum group that has submittedtechnologies to OSF.andP;  Without waiting for the OSF to complete its DCEprocess, IBM is plowing ahead in delivering aspects of its own environment.andO;IBM is promising support for Sun's NFS in a future release of TCP/IP forOS/2.andP;  It's a safe bet that whatever standard emerges in the DCE, IBM willsupport it, as well as continuing to add support for what it decides arevaluable DCE services (such as Kerberos authentication).andM;The picture becomes extremely interesting when one also considers that IBMwill deliver comparable DCE support for AIX.andP;  Suddenly, two environments thatseemed somewhat isolated from one another (SAA and AIX) have potential foradvanced interoperability.andM;W e need to restrain our enthusiasm since the TCP/IP product is not anofficially anointed SAA product.andP;  However, it does run on the strategic SAAplatforms, and the additional DCE support delivered with this packageprovides a mechanism for superb AIX integration.andM;IBM's worst enemy with respect to this package will be itself.andP;  If thepricing rumors surrounding the new RIOS workstations emerging in February arecorrect, IBM internecine warfare is hobbling the market potential of whatcould be a hot system.andP;  Similarly, we are concerned that SAA/SNA adherentsmight dampen the progress of such developments as TCP/IP for OS/2.andM;However, if IBM leverages its technology appropriately, it will be in aposition to offer users their choice of platform with no correspondingpenalty--ultimately, the payoff from DCE.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
