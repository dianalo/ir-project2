(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Soviet and U.S.teen-agers plan to blaze a new trail in international relationsnext month when they work together to restore Yellowstone'sfire-scarred landscape.   The visit by 12 youths from Latvia and Estonia was three yearsin the making and began with a trip to Moscow by a National ParkService delegation.   ``The politics of getting these crews over here areincredible,'' said Helen Wellborn, a regional official for the33-year-old Student Conservation Association, which is coordinatingthe exchange.   Last fall it was decided the first exchange should involveYellowstone, which is recovering from 1988 fires that blackenedalmost half the 2.2-million-acre park.   The U.S. and Soviet teen-agers will help repair trails in thepark, doing such things as clearing debris and countering erosion.   Immediately afterward, the crew of 12 American youths willtravel to the Soviet Union to work on trails in Lahemaa and Gaujanational parks with the Latvian and Estonian teams.   While the main emphasis is to learn more about each country'sparks, the exchange is ``a gesture of international good will asmuch as anything else,'' said Destry Jarvis, the association'sexecutive vice president in Washington.   The exchange has involved long, detailed planning. Tensionsbetween Moscow and the Baltic states, particularly Lithuania, havecaused some worries.   ``If there was any sense or sign of military activities (againstLatvia or Estonia), we would certainly cancel,'' Jarvis said.   The Soviets will arrive in Bozeman on July 5 and leave July 28.During their stay they will also visit nearby Grand Teton NationalPark and travel to Cody for a rodeo, Jarvis said.</TEXT></DOC>
