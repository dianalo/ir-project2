Sales in recent months haven't been as strong as manyexecutives were expecting when 1990 began, but they haven'tcollapsed. November orders showed a 10% gain from a yearearlier, but a 24% drop from October. The weaker dollar hashelped U.S. machine tool makers increase foreign sales.However, the lower-valued dollar hasn't greatly diminishedimport competition. Japanese machine tool companies haveincreased production from their U.S. factories, and arecontinuing to sell at very competitive prices machinesimported from their home plants.</LP><TEXT>   Machine tool companies in recent months have heldproduction at about year-ago levels. They're operating wellbelow optimum rates, and it's difficult to get priceincreases to offset rising costs. In fact, on some machinesdiscounting is more common than it was a year ago.   On the plus side, machine tool companies are continuing tomake progress on cost-reduction. Most have redesigned some oftheir machines to make them both cheaper to produce and moreproductive for the user. And some are making headway withrestructuring programs.   Cincinnati Milacron Inc. expects fourth-quarter profitfrom continuing operations about equal to the third quarter's$2.1 million, or eight cents a share. That would be down fromthe $4.5 million, or 18 cents a share, in the 1989 fourthquarter. The company isn't able to estimate possible year-endcharges related to the sale of its robot business and closingof a European plant. In the 1989 final quarter a loss of $5million from discontinued operations, mainly the loss on saleof a laser business, resulted in a net loss of $435,000, ortwo cents a share.   Milacron was hurt in 1990 by weaker demand for itsplastics injection molding machinery, ordinarily its mostprofitable business, and by lower orders for certain standardmachine tools. The company has had good sales to aerospaceconcerns, a market in which Milacron is particularly strong.   Giddings andamp; Lewis Inc., Fond du Lac, Wis., which has faredbetter than most other machine tool producers during the pasttwo years, had a good fourth quarter, officials said. Theyaren't quarreling with analyst estimates that the companywill earn between $1.80 and $1.85 a share for all of 1990,which indicates fourth-quarter net of 44 cents to 49 cents ashare.   In the 1989 fourth quarter, the producer of machiningcenters, manufacturing cells and automated assembly equipmentearned $4.5 million, or 43 cents a share. For all of 1989,net income totaled $17.1 million, or $1.65 a share. Despiteevidence that the general economy is slowing down, &quot;ourcustomers are going ahead with their plant improvementprojects,&quot; John F. Townsend, vice president, said.   Cross andamp; Trecker Corp., Bloomfield Hills, Mich., is likelyto show a loss for the Dec. 31 period, the first quarter ofthe company's 1991 fiscal year, but officials expect the lossto be smaller than 36 cents a share deficit for the year-agoquarter.   Cross Co., a Cross andamp; Trecker unit that produceshigh-volume parts-making equipment for the auto industry, isdoing better than in 1989. The KT-Swasey division, whichmanufactures lathes, machining centers and manufacturingcells and systems, is likely to report a loss, but a smallerloss than a year ago, the company said. However, the unit'sorders weakened in recent months, a spokesman said.   Profits are lower at the Sheffield measurement equipmentunit, which has been Cross andamp; Trecker's best money-maker forthe past several years. Orders declined in the earlier partof 1990, reducing shipments and earnings.   Earnings at Monarch Machine Tool Co., Sidney, Ohio, &quot;havebeen improving as the year went along, and we expect that tocontinue,&quot; said Robert J. Siewert, president and chiefexecutive officer of the maker of lathes, machining centersand metal coil processing equipment. Fourth-quarter earningswill rise from the $573,625, or 15 cents a share, of thethird period and &quot;should exceed&quot; the $802,532, or 21 cents ashare, of the 1989 fourth quarter, Mr. Siewert said.   Despite the general economic slowdown, some industryexecutives and analysts are expecting 1991 to be a slightlybetter year for the industry. &quot;The machine tool industry hada recession in 1989,&quot; when orders dropped 22% because of acut in auto plant spending, said Eli S. Lustgarten, machineryanalyst with PaineWebber Inc. He's forecasting single-digitorder gains for 1991, with higher automotive purchases morethan offsetting weaker orders from general industry. To besure, the 1991 auto sales outlook isn't good. But GeneralMotors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. must improvetheir cars to become more competitive with Japaneseproducers, and they'll need to buy new machines to do it, hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
