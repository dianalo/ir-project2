Green Jr., director of the STARS program, said last year thatSTARS is committed to &quot;institutionalize software reuse based on well-definedinterface standards -- and to develop labor-saving tools consistent with theconcepts and philosophies of Ada software engineering.&quot;andM;Green said STARS provided the Army with funding for select serviceinitiatives such as RAPID.andP;  But because of a reduced budget last spring,STARS was forced to halt funding to those initiatives.andM;Phase II, which began in January, is partially funded by the SoftwareDevelopment Center and the Information Systems Software Center.andP;  Theremainder of RAPID funding for Phase II will come from the InformationSystems Command, Information Systems Engineering Command, the Army WorldwideMilitary Command and Control System Information System, and the comptrollerof the Army.andM;Joanne Holmberg, RAPID's director, said, &quot;Sound software engineeringdisciplines, which include a viable software reuse program such as RAPID,have the potential of saving the Army billions of dollars over the nextdecade alone.&quot;andM;The potential for RAPID is great and those involved with the program saidthey expect it eventually to expand throughout the military system.andM;RAPID is thought to be generic enough in design to spread across a widediversity of application domains.andM;&quot;Potentially, we see RAPID expansion in Phases III and IV outside of thecommand into all of the Army, and then all of DOD,&quot; Piper said.andP;  She said thegoal is to make RAPID available to the entire military.andM;The project has been in development since July 1987, when a contract wasawarded to Softech Inc., Waltham, Mass.andM;Phase I consisted of software development for a RAPID center library systemand standards for the development of reusable software components that willreside in the library.andP;  Softech completed the requirements for Phase I inJanuary.andM;The program will undergo pilot testing in Phase II.andP;  A spokesman said thetesting phase of RAPID will last through January of next year.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
