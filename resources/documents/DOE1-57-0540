<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-57-0540 </DOCNO><TEXT>A strain-space thermoplasticity theory of fibrous composites is formulated.Specific results are obtained for a composite system in which the fibersare elastic until failure, while the matrix is of the Mises type withcyclic hardening rule. The loading types considered are: (1) overallmechanical straining, (2) uniform thermal changes, and (3) changes inmatrix yield stress. The material model of the composite is based onthe assumption that the fiber diameter is vanishingly small, and otherfiber volume fraction is finite. Explicit expressions are obtained forinstantaneous strain concentration factors in the phases, for the instantaneousoverall stiffness, and for the overall loading surface and hardeningrule during any combined loading path. The kinematic motions of the localand overall loading surfaces are also discussed. Then, the damage processin polymer composite laminates is analyzed. A failure criterion expressedin terms of strain components is developed for the modeling of matrixtransverse cracking in composite laminates. Comparisons of analyticaland experimental results are presented for a T300/934 graphite epoxysystem. Finally, fatigue of boron aluminum composite laminates is investigated.The saturation damage states sustained by the surviving specimens after2 x 10{sup 6} cycles are analyzed.</TEXT></DOC>
