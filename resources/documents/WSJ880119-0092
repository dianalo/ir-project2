Ferri isn't your typical venture capitalist.    Most venture capitalists invest in a start-up and step aside to watch the company grow. But Mr. Ferri doesn't have that luxury: Already chairman of troubled Paradyne Corp., last month he added the post of chief executive officer after the company's chief quit over management differences.    &quot;When you see a venture capitalist running the company, you know he's got real problems,&quot; remarks Stanley Pratt, publisher of Venture Capital Journal.    It's not that Mr. Ferri isn't trying to step aside. While he makes the major decisions -- two managers handle Paradyne's day-to-day operations -- his primary task is to find a permanent chief for the data communications equipment maker.    An industry leader and a favorite of Wall Street in the early 1980s, Paradyne has fallen from grace. Fraud suits stemming from a government contract and negative publicity have stymied the company since 1983. Distracted from the timely product development crucial to a computer concern, Paradyne soon lost its technological lead. It lost its favor among investors as well, and many analysts have stopped following its stock.    Mr. Ferri, 48 years old, believes that Paradyne has put its past behind it and that the right manager can help revive the company by improving its product line -- and its image with customers and investors. &quot;We have a combination of sales and service and a customer base as good as anybody's in our industry,&quot; he asserts.    But his role likely won't end once a new chief comes on board. A taciturn man who helped fund Paradyne's growth in the early 1970s, he is noted for his hands-on approach and is likely to continue to help run the company for a while. Besides having &quot;an outstanding reputation among professional venture capitalists,&quot; Mr. Ferri &quot;isn't afraid to get in and get his hands dirty to get things done,&quot; Mr. Pratt says. Adds San Francisco investment banker Christopher Covington, &quot;He's like an expanded part of the management team, and that's unusual for a venture capitalist.&quot;    Paradyne ran into trouble in March 1983, when the Securities and Exchange Commission in a civil complaint charged it with &quot;fraud and deceit&quot; in obtaining a $100 million contract to supply the Social Security Administration with a computer network.    After fighting the civil suit for two years, Paradyne in 1985 negotiated a settlement without admitting or denying wrongdoing. Three months later, Paradyne and eight then-current officers were indicted on criminal charges of conspiring to bribe government officials and defraud the Social Security Administration.    Last March, Paradyne settled the charges by pleading guilty to conspiracy, agreeing to pay fines of $1.2 million and sacking Robert Wiggins, its chairman, president and chief executive. Mr. Ferri became chairman, and Jerry Kendall, a former executive vice president, was named president and chief executive. Mr. Kendall quit last month over what the company said were differences in management philosophy.    Paradyne had losses in 1985 and 1986, and posted a $3.3 million loss for the 1987 nine months. Its stock traded as high as $35 during its heyday in 1983. Yesterday, its stock closed at $4.125, down 12.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    Paradyne's basic problems run so deep few stock analysts bother to follow it anymore. &quot;They're going through what might be called the dead-cat bounce -- the stock drops and that's the end of it,&quot; says Paul Bloom, first vice president of Johnson, Lane, Space, Smith andamp; Co., Atlanta. &quot;Their situation is classic to the computer or technology business -- they missed the next product cycle, and in this business when you miss one, you may not get a chance for another.&quot;    He and other analysts say Paradyne was late bringing out an entry for the T-1 multiplexer, equipment for low-cost, high-speed transmission over a single telephone line, &quot;the hot, new growth area.&quot;    And Paradyne's basic market, modems, is vastly more competitive. &quot;The technology is more widely available now; they don't enjoy the technology lead they once held in that market,&quot; says W. Mark Dunkel, vice president of Robinson-Humphrey Co., Atlanta.    Keeping up employee morale, particularly in its highly reputed sales and service forces, is a major challenge, says Mary McCaffrey, an analyst with Cyrus J. Lawrence Inc., New York. Paradyne's work force has shrunk to 3,100 from a high of 4,000 in 1984, mostly because of planned reductions, a spokeswoman says.    Such criticism, particularly on the need for new products, &quot;is an easy answer but I'm not sure it's the right answer,&quot; counters Mr. Ferri. &quot;Our traditional competitors don't have a much broader line, but they do better financially than we do.    &quot;There are many reasons we've done poorly, but maybe the most important is that we have been distracted and we lacked a sense of focus and direction and sense of ownership,&quot; he adds. </TEXT></DOC>
