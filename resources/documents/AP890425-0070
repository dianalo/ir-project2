Official mourners dressed in traditional white hemp clothes andtall hats carried the lacquered black coffin to the grave site on ahillside in the royal burial grounds east of Seoul.   The princess died Friday at age 77.   ``She was the most beautiful and most noble of princesses,''said Alice Kim, who attended the funeral. ``And she was the mostsad.''   The grave site was chosen by a traditional pungsu, or fortuneteller, who decides the most auspicious location and timing of aburial. He used a compass to align the casket in keeping with aKorean belief that a corpses' feet must point south to ensure ahappy afterlife.   Lee Hae-suk, a member of the Yi Dynasty Association who helpedarrange the ceremonies, said Princess Tokhye probably wouldn't mindif her feet didn't quite point due south because her life had beendifficult.   ``She was a very unhappy princess,'' said Lee. ``She would beused to being a little off.''   About 75 people, many of them spectators, attended a traditionalConfucian burial ceremony at Changdok Palace in central Seoul,where the princess spent the last years of her life as a recluse.The body was then taken to the royal burial grounds.   Princess Tokhye, a daughter of King Kojong, the last Yi king,was born to a royal concubine named Yang in 1912, two years afterher father was forced to abdicate by the Japanese, who took controlof Korea.   At age 13, she was sent to school in Japan and later married aJapanese nobleman much older than herself. Her mother died beforeshe could return to Korea and her only child committed suicide.   In 1951, the princess was divorced from her Japanese husband andin 1962 she returned to her homeland, suffering from diabetes andaphasia.   Visitors said she was sometimes heard humming or singing toherself, but she hadn't spoken for many years.</TEXT></DOC>
