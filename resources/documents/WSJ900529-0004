The triennial conference, last held in Phoenix, Ariz., in1987, goes by the arcane name the International SwitchingSymposium. It is a place for the industry's most prominentscientists and developers to present their views onleading-edge technologies.</LP><TEXT>   ISS in the past has offered a window on where thetelecommunications industry is headed in terms of new voiceand data services for business and residential customers.This year's presentations on optical switches and networkmanagement systems seemed to presage a revolution in thepublic phone network over the next three to 10 years.   These changes will enable companies to begin trading vastamounts of information with other firms by using fiber opticsand the public network. Moreover, the presentation shows thatpublic phone companies have begun laying the groundwork forbetter integrating of disparate communications technologies,which include cellular radio and private data networks.   Many of the technologies discussed were in varying stagesof development at the time of the Phoenix meeting in 1987,when the thrust of the technical presentations dealt withso-called System VII common channel signaling networks thathelped route voice and data calls. Others dealt withIntegrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) technology forsending voice and data calls simultaneously over the samewire.   Since Phoenix, System VII networks have proliferated. Infact, one of those networks figured prominently in thesoftware malfunction that felled American Telephone andamp;Telegraph Co.'s long-distance network last January. And ISDNsystems are now being used by numerous companies, such asAmerican Express Co., to increase the efficiency of theirworkers, who can now talk on the phone and share computerinformation on their personal computers without having tomake an expensive and time-consuming second call.   Some of this year's more noteworthy presentations includethose by scientists at ATandamp;T, Japan's NEC Corp. and France'sAlcatel, who are presenting papers on optical computers thatswitch voice and data calls using light beams from lasersrather than electronic signals. Other industry giants, suchas Northern Telecom Ltd. of Canada; Ericsson of Sweden;Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. of Japan, and BritishTelecom plan presentations on high-capacity or broad-bandtransmission using fiber optic networks and the methods formanaging such traffic.   Systems management is becoming more critical becausecompanies will eventually transmit their data through thepublic network at the rate of trillions of bits ofinformation per second, compared with the millions and insome cases billions of bits today.   &quot;In the future, the public networks will have to providewhatever transmission {pipeline} is needed by a customer andmake it as accessible as dialing a simple voice call,&quot; saidDesmond Hudson, president of Northern Telecom World Trade.   Another focus is so-called Intelligent Networks ofcomputers that will someday enable phone companies to allowthird-party suppliers, such as software companies, to sendtheir programs to customers on a dial-up basis. BellCommunications Research Inc., the laboratory owned by theseven Bell regionals, and telecommunications authorities fromWest Germany, France and Italy are among the presenters inthis category.   Attendance at this year's ISS underscores theglobalization of the telecommunications industry, with 84countries sending scientific representatives, compared with48 countries three years ago.</TEXT></DOC>
