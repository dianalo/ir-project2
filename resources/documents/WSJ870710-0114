Tipped off that Mr. Willaby is &quot;noodling&quot; -- catching fish illegally by snagging them in the gills or flesh -- two wildlife officials follow the 250-pound fisherman out to Cedar Creek Lake here. They watch him dive under water with a fishing pole and a very short line and catch two flathead catfish, one 25 pounds and the other 30 pounds.    The wardens, however, conclude that the fish hooked themselves and that Mr. Willaby's catch is legal. Noodling, a misdemeanor, carries a fine of up to $200.    &quot;I didn't even know what noodling was until I was accused of it,&quot; says Mr. Willaby. He's also been accused of shocking, poisoning and stealing fish.    What's gotten him into hot water, the auto-service salesman contends, is his success. He's been catching huge flathead catfish in this unorthodox manner for years, he says, the largest weighing 80 pounds. &quot;The big ones got away.&quot;    Locals watching him catch such fish become jealous, he says; &quot;to catch a fish like this is a once in a lifetime thing for them.&quot; When he tells onlookers that he fishes with a rod and reel, he says, &quot;they call me a liar, we insult each other, and I tell them: 'When you learn to fish, I'll talk to you.'&quot; Then, he makes &quot;it a point to go back real soon and catch some more.&quot; Perhaps not surprisingly, the locals often call the warden.    While noodlers generally drag a line with a big hook on it through the water trying to snag a fish, Mr. Willaby wades along river banks and lake shores until he finds holes where fat catfish are laying eggs. He dives down and pokes his rod and a few inches of line with a baited hook into the nest until the fish bites.    &quot;If someone on the bank saw him, it looks like what he does is very close to noodling,&quot; says wildlife official David Palmer.    The trip to Cedar Creek apparently got Mr. Willaby off the hook, at least for now. The wardens, however, say they are going to try to determine whether Mr. Willaby's method might hurt the fish population by taking too many brood fish.    But Mr. Willaby says it's not the method that makes him so successful, it's the secret formula he puts on the bait. He fishes the way he does, he says, only because &quot;I like to get under the water.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
