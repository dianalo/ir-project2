L. 101-73, 103 Stat. 183, August 9, 1989 (``FIRREA'')).

Statutory and Regulatory Background</ITAG>Pursuant to the Federal Home Loan Bank Act (``Act''), 12 U.S.C. 1421 <T3>et seq</T3>., the Board has broad statutory powers and obligationsto establish and oversee the Federal Home Loan Bank System which is comprisedof twelve banks. <T3>See also</T3> 12 U.S.C. 1423.The election process for 1989 was delayed from June 15, 1989 until September15, 1989 by a temporary regulation codified at 12 CFR 522.30 and adoptedby the former Federal Home Loan Bank Board (``Bank Board'') as an interimmeasure while enactment of FIRREA was pending. Now that FIRREA has clarifiedthat the Board is the regulator of the Federal home loan banks, it is necessaryfor the Board to codify the 1989 temporary schedule for the election ofdirectors and other regulations pertaining to the election of directors.As a related action, the superseded andSection; 522.30 is removed. The Boardalso has proposed regulations for director eligibility requirements underconsideration which the Board expects to promulgate shortly.<ITAG tagnum="84">B. Procedure for Nomination and Election</ITAG>No change was made in 12 CFR 932.8 and 932.9. A change was made in andSection;932.10 to clarify the use of the word ``member''. In andSection; 932.11 achange was made to reflect current election procedures for members whoseprincipal place of business is located in the Virgin Islands. No changewas made to andSection; 932.12 which requires the banks to annually reportstock holdings. A change was made in andSection; 932.13, on the proceduresfor designating and nominating elective directorships to note that putativenominees who represent institutions that fail to meet their applicableminimum regulatory capital requirements may not be nominated. A parallelchange was made in andSection; 932.14 on the election of directors to clarifythat persons who represent institutions that fail to meet their applicableminimum regulatory capital requirements may not be declared elected bythe Board. No change was made in andSection; 932.15 prohibiting actions influencingvotes for directorships. In andSection; 932.16 a change was made to clarifythe use of the word ``State''.<ITAG tagnum="84">C. 1989 Temporary Schedule for Election of Directors</ITAG>Section 932.17 sets the schedule for the nomination and election of directorsin 1989 only. For purposes of the 1989 director election cycle, the datesin this section take precedence over the other sections in this group ofregulations. The section repromulgates the election schedule in 12 CFR522.30 promulgated by the bank Board, inserting the precise dates for thevarious steps in the nomination and election procedure, which, with theenactment of FIRREA, can now be made definite. Nominations for directorshipswill be open from September 15, 1989 until October 15, 1989. The Boardwill notify each eligible candidate of their nomination and provide themwith a questionnaire by October 25, 1989. The nominee must complete thequestionnaire and return it to the Board by November 9, 1989. Electionballots will be mailed to all members by November 24, 1989 and must bereceived at the Board by December 15, 1989. The Board will notify the directorselected by December 31, 1989. This temporary director election schedulewill cease to be effective after June 14, 1990, by the regulation's ownterms.<ITAG tagnum="84">D. Administrative Procedures Act</ITAG>Since this rule is a matter of internal organization, practice, and procedureof the Federal Home Loan Bank System, it is exempt from the public noticeand comment requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (``APA''),5 U.S.C. 551 <T3>et seq. </T3>While the APA requires publication of a substantive regulationnot less than thirty days before its effective date, this delayed effectivedate does not apply to procedural rules such as the instant ones whichpertain to the internal organization and practice of the Federal Home LoanBank System. 12 U.S.C. 553 (b), (d).The Board finds that ``good cause'' exists in this case for suspensionof the usual thirty day delayed effective date as the process for electionof bank directors begins on or before September 15, 1989, when the Boardnotifies member institutions of their nominating rights. It is essentialthat these regulations be in place no later than September 15, 1989. Further,it is in the public's interest to provide prompt action on these matters,and the newly issued procedures to amend the nomination and election processdo not result in any additional burdens to third parties outside the bankSystem. <T3>Cf. Nance </T3>v. <T3>Environmental Protection Agency, </T3>645 F.2d 701, 709 (9th Cir. 1981),<T3>cert. denied, </T3>sub. nom., 454 U.S. 1081 (1981); <T3>Texaco, Inc. </T3>v. <T3>FEA, </T3>531 F.2d 1071, 1082 (Em. App. 1976), <T3>cert. denied, </T3>426 U.S. 941 (1976).Although time does not permit public comment in advance of the effectivedate of this rule, the Board recognizes the value of public comment andhas provided for a sixty day comment period from the projected date ofpublication of these regulations. Public comments will influence possiblefuture revisions of these regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">E. Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required for this regulation,the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612) donot apply.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Parts 522 and 932</ITAG>Conflict of interests, Federal home loan banks.Accordingly, the Federal Housing Finance Board hereby amends part 522,subchapter B, chapter V, title 12 and part 932, subchapter B, chapter IX,title 12, <T3>Code of Federal Regulations, </T3>as set forth below.<ITAG tagnum="72">SUBCHAPTER B_FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK SYSTEM</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">PART 932_ORGANIZATION OF THE BANKS</ITAG>1.
