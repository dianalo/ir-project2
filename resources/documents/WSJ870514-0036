The General Electric Co. unit said it will introduce five new programs at the start of the 1987-88 season in September and bring back 21 existing shows, the most returning series for NBC in more than 25 seasons. Among the programs that were canceled was NBC's highly acclaimed &quot;Hill Street Blues.&quot;    NBC finished first in the network ratings in the just-ended 1986-87 season, giving the network its second consecutive season victory. It was helped by strong viewership of such hits as &quot;The Cosby Show,&quot; &quot;Family Ties&quot; and &quot;L.A. Law.&quot;    But officials at the network, which won Monday, Thursday and Saturday nights last season, said they hope the new programs in part will improve ratings on other nights, particularly Tuesdays, when Capital Cities/ABC Inc.'s network is dominant.    ABC and CBS Inc. are scheduled to announce their new fall lineups in the next few weeks.    NBC said it will introduce three new one-hour dramas: &quot;J.J. Starbuck,&quot; about a billionaire crime investigator; &quot;A Year in the Life,&quot; based on a December 1986 miniseries of the same name about a family, and &quot;Private Eye,&quot; which follows the exploits of a private investigator in the 1950s.    The network is introducing two new half-hour comedies: &quot;A Different World,&quot; a spinoff of &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; about daughter Denise Huxtable at college, and &quot;Who's Dad?&quot; about two men who have custody of the same child.    In one risky move, NBC will shift &quot;Family Ties,&quot; its second-highest-rated hit after &quot;Cosby,&quot; to Sunday nights to make room for &quot;Different World.&quot; NBC said it expects &quot;Ties&quot; will continue to attract large audiences in the new time slot.    NBC said also it plans to air monthly trials this fall of other new shows that may be placed permanently on its schedule later in the season, including &quot;Beverly Hills Buntz,&quot; a &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; spinoff featuring one of the show's more popular characters.    Last fall, NBC replaced 6 and a half hours of prime-time programs.    (Revised WSJ May 15, 1987)</TEXT></DOC>
