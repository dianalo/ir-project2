Whelan </HL><DD> 08/22/89 </DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) </SO><IN> CHEMICALS, PLASTICS (CHM)COMMODITY NEWS, FARM PRODUCTS (CMD) </IN><TEXT>   The Wall Street Journal recently identified me by noting that the organization I head, the American Council on Science and Health, &quot;gets about 10% of its funding from pesticide producers such as Uniroyal Chemical Co., the maker of Alar.&quot; Possibly the editors, who were publishing my commentary on the Great Apple Scare of 1989, meant to convey that 90% of ACSH funding did not come from the makers of pesticides. But this 10% figure was used constantly in subsequent media attempts to detract from ACSH's credibility.    One example among many was a 90-minute interview that Ed Bradley of CBS's &quot;60 Minutes&quot; conducted with me while preparing a follow-up segment to that program's initial Alar report that triggered the scare. He began our discussion of the safety of pesticides thus: &quot;Let's go right to the issue of funding. . . . You get a lot of money from the chemical industry. A lot of people who've looked at your contributors list accuse you of being little more than a hired hand for the companies that make chemicals and pesticides.&quot;    As it happens, our funders -- which we've always listed annually -- include the American Medical Association, insurers, private foundations, individuals and a spectrum of food, chemical, energy-producing and pharmaceutical firms. They don't always agree over the subjects we examine, and we've lost backing when our findings didn't support some grantors' aims. In truth, however, it doesn't matter to our opponents who gave us money, or whether 10% or 5% or some parts per billion came from chemical companies. What matters is that, after a scientific examination, we might designate a consumer product &quot;safe&quot; or dismiss charges of an environmental hazard to human health.    During ACSH's first years, the group did not accept funding from corporations. But even then the issue was made paramount, because our primary foundation supporter had a stake in the oil business. ACSH has had similar experience with journalists asking about individual supporters: &quot;But he worked for a chemical company before he retired . . . and she is married to a pharmaceutical executive.&quot;    After 10 years, what it boils down to is that no source of funding would be acceptable to ACSH's critics. What our critics object to is not our funding -- but our conclusions. If the money rained on us from heaven above, it would be considered polluted or acidic.    Respected scientists affiliated with us or retained by corporations directly to evaluate the contributions of technology to health in America are impugned on a continuing basis. When you raise questions about the safety of industrial products, it is easy to win a debate -- you don't even have to get to the science; just say your opponent is funded by industry.    Many people have asked us over the years why more scientists do not step forward to unmask those pseudoscientists who constantly terrify us about the quality of our food, air and water. Here is one good reason: Since nearly all scientists, either through consulting or university funding, directly or indirectly receive grants from some corporation sometime in their lives, they feel vulnerable to public humiliation by those who throw funding pies instead of addressing the science. Better to stay in the lab or classroom.    Do we not have hypocrisy here? When a publication gratuitously introduces us as the &quot;industry supported&quot; American Council, does it consider its own funding (advertisements) from the same companies that fund ACSH? When I raised the question about CBS's advertising dollars to Mr. Bradley, he bridled. &quot;We are neutral here,&quot; he assured me.    And what of the National Resources Defense Council, the group that brought us Meryl Streep and apple-Alar panic? If the conflicts of funding and finances were universally of interest, why wasn't this organization that zeroes in on pesticides as a carcinogen asked about its substantial holdings in R.J. Reynolds stock?    What ultimately matters is not funding but scientific accuracy and legitimacy. The Tobacco Institute claims that it has never been &quot;proven&quot; that cigarette smoking causes human disease and death. Is this outfit credible? No, but not because it gets all its money from tobacco companies. If the institute were funded by the Easter Bunny its pronouncements still would be scientifically outrageous, because the &quot;controversy&quot; about cigarettes as the No. 1 cause of premature, preventable death has long disappeared. Only the Tobacco Institute says otherwise.    We invite our critics, the ones who claim that our food supply is contaminated, that we suffer from an industrially caused &quot;cancer epidemic,&quot; to step forward for real dialogue and debate. The idea that scientists who are corporate advisers or groups that take unrestricted industry funding are by definition mouthpieces for commercial interests will only continue to chill free exchange because effectively only one side of the issue -- the anti-industry side -- is permitted the status of &quot;credible.&quot; He who pays the piper does not always call the tune.    ---   Mrs. Whelan holds a Harvard doctorate in public health. </TEXT></DOC>
