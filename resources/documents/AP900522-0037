In its annual yearbook, released Monday, the StockholmInternational Peace Research Institute also reported that 26developing countries have acquired ballistic missiles capable ofdelivering nuclear, chemical or biological warheads.   The proliferation of these superlethal missiles ``has created anew fear of arms races among emerging regional powers,'' said theinstitute, commonly called SIPRI.   The 700-page report said, however, that cash-strapped ThirdWorld countries bought fewer weapons and spent less money in 1989 _about $16 billion _ than at any time since 1976.   In 1989, ``the prospects for lasting peace have considerablyimproved, particularly in Europe. But peace has not yet brokenout,'' said Walter Stuetzle, director of the 24-year-old researchinstitute.   SIPRI, which is financed by the Swedish government, tracksdevelopments in global arms traffic, military conflicts anddisarmament initiatives.   Stuetzle, a former West German undersecretary of defense, told anews conference that the U.S.-Soviet strategic arms treaty undernegotiation would not reduce nuclear arsenals enough to have animpact on military capabilities.   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet ForeignMinister Eduard Shevardnadze announced after talks in MoscowSaturday that major progress had been made that may allow a treatyto be initialed at a summit next week and signed before year's end.   ``There is still room for drastic reductions,'' Stuetzle said.The treaty ``has no military relevance when you talk aboutdeterrence or perception.''   In its report, SIPRI said $950 billion was spent worldwide ondefense last year, a 2 percent drop from the previous years.   ``After the dizzying heights of the 1980s, global defensespending began to fall in 1989. The decline was modest, however,''and was due more to tight budgets and technology advances than topeaceful intentions, it said.   The United States and the Soviet Union trimmed military spendingby about 2 percent, but NATO's European members kept their defensebudgets stable. In East Europe, cuts were announced, but won't befelt until next year.   ``Neither the political will to pursue reductions beyond thislevel nor the reward in the form of a disarmament dividend or peaceprize are forthcoming,'' it said.   Though arms control prospects looked bright, ``performance didnot match up to promises'' in reducing military spending, it said.   The report also made these points:   _ The number of wars and major regional conflicts fell last yearto 32 from 35, the fewest in three years. In addition, about 75lesser conflicts were waged, defined as involving fewer than 1,000deaths.   _ The Soviet Union led the world in arms exports last year,though the value shrank to $11.6 billion from $12.5 billion theprevious year and from $14.7 billion in 1987. Nearly three-fourthswere sold to Third World countries. U.S. arms exports totalled$10.7 billion, and about 76 percent went to industrial nations.   _ India, for the third successive year, was the world's largestarms importer, spending $3.8 billion. Japan was second, spending$3.1 billion.   _ The cost for destroying chemical weapons will be enormous,even for those countries like Belgium and Denmark still keeping75-year-old stocks from World War I. The United States must spend$3 billion, while the Soviet Union still lacks the technology tosafely demolish its arsenal.</TEXT></DOC>
