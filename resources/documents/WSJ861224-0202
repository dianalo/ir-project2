Here's Your Film---By Julie Salamon</HL><DD> 12/24/86</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><TEXT>   The plot of the thriller &quot;The Morning After&quot; has gaping holes, and it's pretty easy to figure out who the killer is. But I was hooked when a woman who thinks she may have murdered a man sticks his telephone in the dishwasher to erase her fingerprints.    Jane Fonda plays the woman, an alcoholic almost-was actress called Alex. She's in such bad shape she can wake up from a drunken binge and think she's simply forgotten she killed the corpse sharing her bed. She's also tough-talking and pretty -- maybe too pretty for a boozer -- and smart enough to come up with an efficient way (full wash cycle) to get rid of any evidence of her presence in the dead man's house.    For the first time in a long time it was fun watching Ms. Fonda onscreen. This is the best she's been since &quot;Klute.&quot; Her Alex is anything but high-minded; she's got a foul mouth and the edge of a woman who lives by her wits when she isn't addling them with drink. But she's also funny, almost ditzy. Though she wears skirts slit up her thighs and satiny bathrobes and she evidently sleeps around, she doesn't come off as a coquette, just a little lost. She's a woman who almost was something and remembers what it felt like -- and Ms. Fonda makes her seem all that.    The movie opens with a television show about a soft-porn photographer. The camera cuts from his laughing face onscreen, to him lying in bed, apparently sleeping. The dyed-blonde next to him is Alex. She wakes up, pulls back the sheets and discovers that her one-night stand has a knife plunged into his chest. She does a few comic double takes, staring at him dead in bed, him alive on television.    From there, the movie has her trying to find out if she murdered this man in a drunken stupor, and if not, who did? She hooks up with a laconic ex-cop played by Jeff Bridges, with whom she falls in love. Raul Julia lurks in the background as the hairdresser-husband she hasn't lived with for 10 years but who remains her confidant.    Director Sidney Lumet rambles through this mystery without much concern for how much sense any of it makes. He and his screenwriter, James Hicks, drop in bits of corny film noir. The ex-cop says to Alex, for example: &quot;You're a rare dame.&quot; And when Alex passes out drunk after a phone call, there's a tight close-up of the phone and the booze glass.    The story raises lots of portents and leaves them hanging, as when Alex says of her husband's profession: &quot;A hairdresser is what he is, not what he does.&quot; Turner, the ex-cop, is supposed to be a redneck, but even when he's insulting blacks and Jews he seems to be putting Alex on. Everything about him is ambiguous, including the vast library of books he says he's never read, which he keeps in his makeshift loft. Still, there's plenty of tension, and a couple of spots that are quite scary.    Mainly, there are Ms. Fonda and Mr. Bridges, who work nicely together, nicely enough to keep the rickety structure from collapsing. Though the actor would probably be advised to bow out next time he's offered the part of a former alcoholic ex-cop (&quot;8 Million Ways to Die&quot; was the first time he played it this year), he's extremely sympathetic here. There's something reassuring about him, with his Andy Griffith drawl and comfy padding. He and Ms. Fonda make &quot;The Morning After&quot; easy to take, without aspirin.    ---   The screenplay for another action-thriller called &quot;No Mercy&quot; was written by Jim Carabatsos, who also wrote &quot;Heartbreak Ridge,&quot; Clint Eastwood's latest film. I mention this because the improbable one-man-army antics required of the lead in &quot;No Mercy&quot; might have slid by if Mr. Eastwood were in the role.    Instead, Richard Gere plays Eddie Jillette, a down-and-dirty Chicago cop whose quest to avenge his partner's murder leads him to New Orleans and the Louisiana bayou. There he takes on the local bayou bad guy, a pony-tailed hulk called Losado. He also falls in love with Losado's Cajun lover, played by Kim Basinger with her usual over-ripeness.    Director Richard Pearce has put this picture together with a lot of pounding music and characters who look exotic and dangerous. The Dutch actor Jeroen Krabbe as Losado burns with demonic intensity. Ms. Basinger glows with sexuality. Mr. Gere bristles. There is a lot of motion, as Eddie and Michel (Ms. Basinger) end up wading through swamps, racing in cars, booby-trapping an old hotel -- all to elude, then capture the evil Losado.    The problem with all this high-tempo motion is that none of it really makes any sense. It's the MTV syndrome: People simply show up in the right places looking the right way but you never know quite who they are or how they got there. Mr. Pearce also hasn't resisted the temptation to keep dousing Ms. Basinger in water; wetness is becoming the trademark of this actress, who is forever sweating or having ice cubes rubbed on her body (&quot;9 1/2 Weeks&quot;).    Worse, the script occasionally lapses into a bad imitation of '40s movie talk. Mr. Gere tells Ms. Basinger, before they decide that they are on the same side and, in fact, lust for each other: &quot;Keep your felt mouth shut.&quot; Felt mouth? Later, he loftily informs her: &quot;I'm going to die on Chicago concrete.&quot; Mr. Gere isn't bad. It's the movie that begs for mercy. </TEXT></DOC>
