<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-30-0781 </DOCNO><TEXT>The response of the atmosphere to emissions of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)and other chlorocarbons, and to increasing concentrations of other radiativelyactive trace gases such as CO{sub 2}, CH{sub 4}, and N{sub 2}O is calculatedby a coupled chemical-radiative transport one-dimensional model. It isshown that significant reductions in the ozone concentration and in thetemperature are expected in the upper stratosphere as a result of increasingconcentrations of active chlorine produced by photodecomposition of theCFCs. The ozone content is expected to increase in the troposphere, asa consequence of increasing concentrations of methane and nitrogen oxides.Due to enhanced greenhouse effects, the Earth's surface should warm upby several degrees. The amplitude and even the sign of future changesin the ozone column are difficult to predict as they are strongly scenario-dependent.An early detection system to prevent noticeable ozone changes as a resultof increasing concentrations of source gases should thus be based ona continuous monitoring of the ozone amount in the upper stratosphererather than on measurements of the ozone column only. Measurements ofNOx, Clx, and HOx are also required for unambiguous trend detection andinterpretation.</TEXT></DOC>
