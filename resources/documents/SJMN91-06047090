It contained Iraqi PresidentSaddam Hussein's first clear-cut offer to withdraw from Kuwait.; Q Why thendid the coalition reject the proposal?; A The offer also demanded otheractions that the United States and its allies find unacceptable.;   Specifically, the proposal calls for nine conditions to be met, ranging fromending the United Nations-imposed embargo against Iraq to a U.S. withdrawalfrom the region and an Israeli evacuation of the &quot;occupied Palestine (the WestBank and Gaza) and other Arab territories in the Syrian Golan Heights andLebanon.&quot;; Q What prompted Saddam to propose such an initiative?; A Mostanalysts believe Iraq's military machine has been severely weakened by theallied air assault and that Saddam is looking for a way to either end the waror weaken the coalition by sowing division among its members. It is alsopossible that Saddam is simply trying to buy time by starting a diplomaticprocess that he has no intention of pursuing in good faith.;    The drivecould also provide him yet another opportunity to sway world public opinion inhis favor, suggesting he has peaceful intentions.; Q Will there still be aground war?; A U.S. military officials have said their war plan will continue,and many analysts feel that plan includes the start of a ground war soon.; QWhat is the next step in all this?; A Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz meetswith Soviet leaders Monday and it appears the outcome of that meeting couldeither propel the diplomatic process or trigger the launch of a ground war.; QIs President Bush's call for Saddam's ouster a new objective of thecoalition's effort?; A The president has said in the past that Saddam was nota target of U.S. forces and that the coalition's only goal was the departureof his troops from Kuwait. Bush's suggestion on Friday, however, implied theUnited States would support an effort to depose the Iraqi leader.;    Thatview is not held by all coalition members, however. Some believe that Saddamshould not be targeted, and that Iraq must have a strong leadership when thewar ends so that it is not threatened by two other problematic powers in theMiddle East -- Syria and Iran.; Q Why is the Soviet Union playing such ahigh-profile role?; A Iraq sits close to the Soviet Union's southern border,which makes unrest in the region more dangerous for the Soviets. The Sovietsalso have been a main provider of military hardware to the Iraqis in recentyears. Indeed, President Mikhail Gorbachev has been strongly criticized bysome members of his own government and military officials for abandoning Iraqas part of the U.S.-led coalition. Bringing an end to the war would both boosthis prestige abroad and calm some of the dissent at home.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Mercury News Staff and Wire Reports  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910216  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  16A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  532  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday February 16, 199100047090,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
