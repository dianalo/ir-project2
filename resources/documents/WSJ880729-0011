GOP strategists note the Dukakis lead in recent polls is less than Carter's or Reagan's at comparable points in 1976 and 1980. They expect to start chipping away at the Democrat's edge, with national security the first target. Bush plans two high-profile speeches in the next two weeks, stressing the need for caution in dealing with the Soviets despite Gorbachev's reforms.    After a slow start, the campaign begins strengthening its foreign policy staff. Former National Security Council aide Dennis Ross is about to join as coordinator. Former NSC adviser Scowcroft quietly steps up his involvement. Another quiet consultant: Richard Burt, U.S. ambassador in West Germany and a possible Bush NSC adviser.    Peggy Noonan, a favorite speechwriter from the Reagan White House, has begun drafting Bush's convention acceptance speech.    REPUBLICANS PRESS for Senate votes to embarrass Bentsen.    They hope to accentuate differences between Dukakis and his running mate. The GOP will try to attach a Contra aid provision to the pending Pentagon spending bill: Sen. Lugar pointedly reminds reporters that Bentsen &quot;has been good to work with&quot; on the Contra issue. Bentsen aides insist the senator won't change his position.    The Republicans also hoped to score points on the vote on Medicaid abortions in cases of rape and incest -- but Bentsen was out of town campaigning. Democrats warn that the strategy could backfire, arguing that moderate voters will be impressed at Dukakis's willingness to pick a running mate more conservative than he is.    ECONOMIC VACUUM? Baker's departure could hobble policy making.    His long-planned exit next month for the Bush campaign, combined with other pending departures, leaves key vacancies. Treasury counselor Robert Zoellick, a major policy adviser, quit yesterday to join the campaign. The Treasury's chief domestic and foreign economic officers, George Gould and David Mulford, stay for now but may leave later. White House economic strategist Dan Crippen departs today.    Dillon, Read chairman and Bush adviser Nicholas Brady is the likely choice to succeed Baker, though Deputy Secretary of State Whitehead remains in contention. Both have Wall Street experience but lack Baker's ties to foreign economic officials and stature with the markets. A new dollar crisis or stock market tumble could be much tougher to calm without Baker.    Fed chief Greenspan would welcome a Brady choice, despite their recent differences over stock-market reform.    DUKAKIS'S STANDING with blacks rises significantly, according to the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll. Seventy-one percent of black likely voters view the nominee favorably, up from 58% before the convention. Dukakis leads Bush by 85% to 5% among blacks; a majority of blacks also believe Jackson was treated fairly at the convention.    THORNBURGH SEEKS to put a swift if symbolic imprint on Justice, hoping to make voters forget Meese quickly. The attorney general-designate is expected to push for tougher ethics legislation and ethics guidelines for agency officials. He is also expected to clean house in the civil rights division, whose controversial chief Bradford Reynolds will probably soon depart.    FOOD TASTERS WANTED: Dole, who blamed the press for much of his poor showing in the presidential primaries, will cohost -- along with the American Trucking Associations -- a reception for &quot;members of the American press corps&quot; the day before the GOP convention opens.    ENSURING DEFEAT? A bill to end insurance companies' antitrust exemption for such things as price fixing runs into industry and partisan opposition in the House. The bill has the support of the GOP-controlled FTC, but &quot;we can't get one Republican vote&quot; in the Judiciary Committee, Democratic Rep. Edwards complains.    CRITICAL TESTS LOOM for the space-shuttle program.    NASA engineers struggle to repair a small fuel line leak while Discovery remains on the launch pad: Pulling the shuttle back to the warehouse to fix it would be a humiliating blow for the space agency, which rolled it out to the pad on July 4 amid much fanfare. In any event, the problem probably pushes the earliest possible launch date to the end of September or early October.    Even if the leak is fixed, the shuttle must also pass a critical engine-firing test Monday and a solid-rocket-booster test next month. Complications abound if the launch date slips to November. NASA would have to test-fire a refrigerated booster to see how it performs in cold weather.    Officials cringe at the prospect of a cold-weather launch, remembering how freezing temperatures contributed to the Challenger disaster.    MINOR MEMOS: A photo in the autobiography of self-proclaimed foreign-policy expert Bush misidentifies No. 10 Downing Street and labels Mrs. Thatcher's husband, Denis, as &quot;Norman.&quot; . . .Struggling to produce a drought-relief bill, House Agriculture Chairman de la Garza declares: &quot;It ain't over 'til it's over, and it's never over in this committee.&quot; . . .The ex-tenant: Nixon slipped quietly into the White House yesterday for a private chat with Reagan. </TEXT></DOC>
