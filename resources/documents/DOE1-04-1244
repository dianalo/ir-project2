One of the biggest receiversof subsidies is German black-coal mining. Thousands of millions of Deutschmarksfrom the tax revenue go to its support each year, the reason given beingthe necessity to safeguard energy supply, provide employment, and executeregional policy. These arguments were tested by the author for theirvalidity on the occasion of an expert discussion organized by the Institutefor Economics and Society (IWG) between representatives of science, economy,politics, and the trade unions and held in Bonn in November 1985. Asfar as possible, the author lets the experts speak for themselves andexchange their opinions. The result of the investigation is as unmistakableas it is disillusioning: There is no longer any rational justificationfor boosting German black-coal mining with thousands of millions, asis current practice. The book is an urgent appeal to put German coalpolicy right.</TEXT></DOC>
