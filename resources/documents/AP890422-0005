The flight of the INS-chartered Boeing 737 was the fifth suchflight since Feb. 21, when the INS began a crackdown onundocumented aliens crossing the Rio Grande.   A previous charter flight of 231 aliens left Texas on March 13and was believed to be the largest mass deportation by the INS.More than 1,300 Central Americans have been deported since thecrackdown began.   The refugees _ some smiling, other sulking _ were processed outof the INS detention camp near Bayview and filed into four busesbound for the Brownsville-South Padre Island International Airport.   There were no Nicaraguans on the flight, although more than aquarter of the 1,250 detainees at the camp are from Nicaragua.   Nicaraguans are the only nationality to have escaped thecrackdown, thanks to a directive issued by then-Attorney GeneralEdwin Meese III, in July 1987.   Meese requested that the INS encourage asylum applications andwork authorizations for refugees fleeing the leftist Nicaraguangovernment. Deportation for Nicaraguans must be approved by INSheadquarters in Washington, D.C.   Among the immigrants deported Thursday were 68 Salvadorans, 38Guatemalans and 14 Hondurans.   The INS said 703 refugees applied for asylum in the Harlingendistrict since Feb. 21. Of those applicants, 72 Nicaraguans and sixSalvadorans were granted asylum. The rest were detained to be sentback to their homelands.</TEXT></DOC>
