Bush's actions were ``positive steps helpful to thenormalization of relations between China and the United States,''said Foreign Ministry spokesman Jin Guihua. ``We welcome this.''   Bush this week exempted from economic sanctions the export ofthree communications satellites to be launched by China andsanctioned Export-Import Bank credit to companies doing business inChina.   The relaxation of sanctions followed a Dec. 9-10 visit toBeijing by National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft that ended aU.S. ban on high-level exchanges between the two sides.   The Bush administration, which imposed the sanctions after thebloody military attack on student-led pro-democracy demonstratorsthis June, has been criticized for being too friendly to Beijing'shard-line leaders.   White House officials said the decision to allow China to launchsatellites for Australian and Hong Kong firms, and the waiving ofrestrictions on low-interest Ex-Im Bank loans to Americansinvesting in China, were in the ``national interest.''   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the sale of thesatellites will bring $300 million worth of business to U.S. firms.   Jin declined comment on whether Bush's actions would help settleother outstanding issues, particularly that of Fang Lizhi, theoutspoken dissident who has been hiding in the U.S. Embassy inBeijing since June.   Jin repeated the Chinese position that Fang's future is a``sensitive question'' that must be solved through joint efforts ofthe two sides.   Jin also reread a Foreign Ministry statement issued earliercondemning U.S. military action in Panama, saying it wasinterference in the internal affairs of another country and aviolation of international law.   On Saturday, a senior Soviet Communist Party official arrivesfor a visit to include talks between the two largest Marxistnations on the crisis in world communism.   The crumbling of one-party Communist rule in Eastern Europe iscertain to be on the agenda during the weeklong visit of ValentinFalin, head of the decision-making Central Committee'sInternational Department, a Soviet Embassy official said.   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said theChinese are unhappy with events in Eastern Europe and are eager tosound out the Soviets on their approach to the popular groundswellof opposition to Communist rule.   The official said the Chinese have also expressed concern aboutgrowing turmoil in Romania, East Europe's most stubborn holdoutagainst political reform and a staunch ally of China since itsmilitary crackdown.   On bilateral matters, Falin will discuss how to improveparty-to-party relations following the May visit of PresidentMikhail S. Gorbachev, which ended a 30-year freeze in Sino-Sovietparty contacts.   Falin has asked to meet party General Secretary Jiang Zemin, anda favorable response from the Chinese would indicate theirwillingness to move party relations to a higher plane, the officialsaid.   The two sides may touch on a planned visit by Premier Li Peng toMoscow, tentatively set for next April.   The official said overall Sino-Soviet relations have generallyprogressed well since the Gorbachev visit in spite of the Juneturmoil in China and divergences in views on political reform.   He said there were so many Soviet delegations visiting Chinathat the embassy could no longer handle them all. Trade along theonce-tense border is booming, and total bilateral trade is expectedto increase substantially from last year's $3.25 billion.   The official China Daily said Thursday that the two countriesare now discussing cooperation in a $46 million project to buildChina's first coal slurry pipeline.   Soviet officials acknowledge, however, that China's top priorityis still obtaining Western technology, and China's strainedrelations with the West will not result in a sharp increase inSino-Soviet economic exchanges.   The Soviet Union, the official said, hopes better relations withChina will facilitate multinational development of Siberia's richnatural resources, with Chinese laborers being brought in forprojects backed by Japanese, U.S. and South Korean technology andfinancing.</TEXT></DOC>
