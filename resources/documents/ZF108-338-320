(WMI), says LANs are a good investment for manysmall businesses.andM;Tom Beynon, president and CEO, WMI says: &quot;I recommend that first time userslook at products that have simplicity, ease of installation, ease of use andmaintenance, without sacrifice of power or performance.andP;  Certainly amigration path to a high-end system is important to many users.&quot;andM;Begin by taking inventory of your existing computer equipment.andP;  Look for aLAN that will use existing technology to the fullest advantage, while meetingother specific requirements.andP;  This means choosing a LAN that is compatiblewith the hardware you are using.andP;  But it means a lot more than that.andM;Look for a LAN with flexible disk sharing capability (that is, one disk driveon each workstation can be shared), so that each workstation has the abilityto act as a file server.andP;  This gives the LAN system manager the choicebetween a nondedicated (peer-to-peer) mode of operation, maximizing theinvestment in existing hardware; or a dedicated file server, maximizingserver performance and data security.andM;An entry level system should offer several communications capabilities.andP;  Thesystem should not only allow users to share printers, but should also includea print queue for easy management of files.andP;  In addition, options shouldinclude software and data sharing.andP;  You might want to look at other options,such as electronic mail, remote PC connectivity, and modem sharing (for userswho need to access a bulletin board or a public network).andM;Take into account the installation process, as the installation of a LAN cantake anywhere from hours to days.andP;  You should also check into the support andamount of training involved in getting your employees comfortable with theLAN.andM;In order to maintain control over a LAN system, it is necessary to have someform of data protection.andP;  An entry-level LAN should incorporate: standardsecurity passwords and identification, specific authorization needed beforefiles are accessible on the LAN and automatic power down protection.andM;A LAN can be invaluable when used effectively in a small businessenvironment.andP;  When you do decide to install a LAN, think of future growth.andO;Small businesses often grow, and the right LAN will grow with you.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
