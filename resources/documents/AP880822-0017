A House Government Operations Committee report, released Sunday,described two separate systems for handling claims.   Applicants without ``pull'' had their cases rushed to judgmentby error-prone managers trying to win pay bonuses for meetingproduction quotas, the report said.   But the panel said the Bureau of Veterans Appeals _ the court oflast resort for claimants whose benefits were denied _ ``maintaineda list of congressmen who should be brought to the BVA chairman'sattention if they inquire about an appeal.''   At a hearing last February by the panel's subcommittee on humanresources, a former appeals board member, Daniel J.B. Bierman, wasasked whether there was preferential treatment when a lawmaker onthe list intervened.   Bierman replied, ``It is difficult for me to say, but I suspectthat to be the case, sir. Otherwise, there would be no reason forit (the list).''   ``The BVA ... showed favoritism to claimants who had the ear ofcertain influential members of Congress,'' the committee concluded.   The VA said in a statement it ``has not been provided with acopy of the committee's report and is obviously disadvantaged bythe fact that it was released to the media before it came to us. Weintend to review it thoroughly when it is received.''   VA officials refused to reply to the panel's specificallegations.   Addressing the appeals board's quota system, the report said,``The Board of Veterans Appeals ... was so caught up in anunreasonable production quota standard, that some members weredeciding cases at the rate of one every eight minutes.''   The committee noted that earlier this year, the VA endedproduction-based bonuses and preferential treatment after bothpractices were publicized in subcommittee hearings and challengedin a lawsuit filed by Vietnam Veterans of America.   The report suggested that Congress end a 55-year-old prohibitionand allow veterans who are denied benefits to appeal their cases infederal court. In 1987, veterans won less than 13 percent of thetime under the now-abolished quota system at the VA appeals board.   The committee said the VA tried to cover up its frequentmistakes in disability claims by deliberately under-reporting theerror rate to staffers for the human resources subcommittee, headedby Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y.   The VA approves about $11 billion in disability benefitsannually to 2.5 million veterans, widows and children. While someveterans were improperly denied benefits under the VA'serror-plagued system, others may have received money to which theywere not entitled, according to committee staffers.   Nine of the 15 Republicans on the 38-member committee fileddissenting views disagreeing with the recommendation for courtappeals.   ``While we share the committee's concerns about ... practicessuch as production quotas ... we cannot support the committee'sinference that the (appeals board) does not have the best interestsof the veterans in mind,'' they said.   The report did not give exact numbers of errors, but cited a1984 internal study of 1,700 cases by VA lawyer Ronald B. Abrams.He found:   _A ``substantive'' error rate of 8.4 percent that led to denialof claims that should have been approved. This category refers tomathematical and other factual errors.   _An 18.2 percent ``judgmental'' error rate, in which the wrongdecision was made even though the data used to render the opinionwere accurate.   _A ``procedural'' error rate of 21.5 percent, in cases where themistake did not affect the final benefit determination.   The VA, however, gave the subcommittee lower error rates for the1983-87 period: substantive errors, 1.02 percent to 1.73 percent;judgmental errors, 1.11 percent to 1.81 percent, and proceduraldiscrepancies, 3.91 percent to 5.09 percent.   The VA's quota system was described to the subcommittee earlierthis year by Ernest B. Wright, a member of the Board of VeteransAppeals, and Bierman.   ``They testified that BVA members ... had production quotas of40 cases per week, which if fulfilled, could result in merit payincreases as high as 5 percent of a member's pay,'' the report said.</TEXT></DOC>
