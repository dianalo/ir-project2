Is Surviving After Felony Conviction---Firm Uses Political and EconomicMuscle to Help Lessen Penalties---By Karen BlumenthalStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 05/26/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> SLC TAXESFOOD andamp; BEVERAGE, HOUSEHOLD GOODS, SUPERMARKETS, TOBACCO (FAB) </IN><DATELINE> DALLAS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   When Southland Corp., the nation's largest convenience-store chain, was convicted of tax fraud three years ago, it faced potentially serious penalties to its business in states around the country.    But with strategic use of its political and economic muscle, the owner and operator of 7-Eleven stores has made sure that its status as a corporate felon came to little more than a nuisance rap.    Southland was fined $10,000 for the tax-fraud offense in a federal bribery-conspiracy case in New York City. That conviction threatened its sale of beer, wine and lottery tickets in several states where laws forbid felons or those of questionable moral character from holding liquor and lottery licenses. Indeed, as much as 20% of its 7,672 stores around the U.S. faced lengthy suspension or even revocation of critical sales permits.    But Southland mounted an aggressive lobbying campaign to get its way with state legislators and regulators who write and enforce licensing laws -- and so far has succeeded.    Only two states, Iowa and Oregon, halted 7-Eleven beer and wine sales -- for just three days each. Southland persuaded legislators in five states to change laws on its behalf; without the changes, the states would have had to revoke Southland's licenses. And, through tough negotiating with liquor commissions, the retailer so far has limited its fines to about $300,000, or less than half the chain's daily candy sales. That amount doesn't include what Southland spent to hire local lawyers and lobbyists, and to make political contributions.    Only Florida, where Southland's more than 700 stores generate about $90 million in beer and wine sales, is still challenging Southland's liquor licenses. Despite Southland-sponsored legislation to amend Florida law, and an appeal to the governor for &quot;corporate clemency,&quot; Southland nevertheless has been forced to prove that none of its current officers participated in the company's crime.    John H. Rodgers, Southland's general counsel, won't say how much the company spent defending itself, arguing that the amount isn't material. In fact, Southland, which had 1986 revenue of $8.62 billion, has never disclosed its conviction or settlements in its quarterly or annual financial reports. &quot;It just hasn't been a tremendous problem,&quot; he says.    But Mr. Rodgers also disputes the notion that Southland received special treatment. He contends that media coverage of the trial pressured more states to take action than might have otherwise. &quot;In most situations, I don't think they would have watched this as closely as they did if it weren't for the publicity,&quot; he says.    For the states, too, the issue has been nettlesome. State officials say such corporate convictions are rare, leaving them few precedents to rely on. Further, they recognize that Southland, like other large companies, is a big employer, a generator of sales-tax revenue and a generous contributor to charitable causes. And they aren't sure that a federal tax-law violation is related to liquor or lottery sales.    The company's troubles stem from a fee it paid in 1977 that the company maintained was for legal services. Federal prosecutors alleged that the fee was actually meant to be used as a bribe for New York state tax officials, although a bribe never was paid. A federal jury found that the statute of limitations had run out on a bribery-conspiracy charge. But the jury found Southland guilty of conspiring to defraud the Internal Revenue Service because it claimed the fee as a business deduction. The company's $10,000 fine was the maximum penalty.    The verdict didn't set Southland back. Even before the conviction, the company studied various state laws regarding corporate felons; after the conviction, it went to work to stop problems before they festered. Iowa, for instance, threatened to make Southland sell its stores or lose its licenses. But the company met several times with Iowa officials, pointing out its contributions to the state and flexing some economic muscle.    &quot;They said they would not run the stores without beer,&quot; says Gary L. Hayward, Iowa assistant attorney general. Given the state's economy, &quot;We didn't think it was necessary to throw those people out of work.&quot; Instead, Iowa fined Southland $12,500 and halted beer sales for three days.    Eight other states also assessed fines, ranging from $6,750 in Connecticut to $157,680 in California.    In New Mexico, Southland's efforts to protect liquor licenses at 15 stores stirred up a noisy political debate. In January, the state attorney general ruled that the Alcoholic Beverage Control director didn't have the discretion to let a convicted felon hold liquor licenses. The agency director notified Southland that the licenses wouldn't be renewed July 1. Recently elected Gov. Garrey Carruthers, remembering the angry criticism a predecessor received for pardoning a corporate felon, refused to pardon Southland but said he would sign legislation that changed the law.    In response, Southland's New Mexico law firm and two specially hired lobbyists descended on the state legislature, convincing state Sen. Dennis C. Chavez to sponsor a bill allowing the director or the governor to grant licenses to felons who prove they &quot;merit the public trust.&quot; Mr. Chavez says, &quot;Until they asked . . . , I hadn't even heard of Southland.&quot; But he says he agreed because Southland has 300 employees in the state &quot;and darn it, those licenses play a big factor in their revenues.&quot;    Mr. Chavez found opposition in state Sen. Tom Rutherford, who acknowledges that Southland contributed to his campaign. But Mr. Rutherford was offended by how Southland played down its conviction. &quot;They portrayed it as (if) all they had done was make a mistake on their income tax,&quot; he says.    The bill narrowly passed the Senate, 20-19, and then passed the House, 43-19. The new law, which mandates a $2,500-a-store fine for felons who keep their licenses, takes effect in mid-June.    The company had an easier time convincing legislatures in Hawaii, Louisiana and Colorado to adjust their laws. In Hawaii and Louisiana, liquor officials supported changes that gave them discretion in deciding whether a felon should get a license. In Colorado, the lottery laws were changed to make exceptions for felonies unrelated to gambling.    Sherry Harrington, Colorado lottery director, said the legislative changes helped Southland as well as another company that makes lottery equipment but which couldn't bid for Colorado business because of previous legal troubles. Colorado benefits as well, because Southland sold about 18% of Colorado's $100 million in lottery tickets in the year ended June 30, 1986.    &quot;There is some question as to whether we serve ourselves in this. And the answer is, 'of course,'&quot; says Ms. Harrington. But not everyone gets a license: She recently denied a lottery permit to a man, now in his 30s, who was convicted of growing marijuana in his backyard when he was 17 years old.    The state told Southland it would suspend lottery-ticket sales for 10 days if Southland violated a one-year probation. The company recently completed the probation.    Further, some states consider their fines harsh penalties. Illinois, for example, fined Southland $27,000, or $500 a store. &quot;I realize Southland deals in millions, but that was a rather substantial amount for the purposes of the Illinois Liquor Control Commission.&quot; says Peter Carlson, the liquor commission's chief legal counsel. &quot;No one's ever paid that kind of money before.&quot;    Legal loopholes also helped Southland's cause. California and Illinois lottery laws prohibit a company from selling tickets only if an officer, director or major shareholder is convicted of a felony; the license isn't affected if the company is convicted of a crime. And in New York, where Southland was convicted under federal law, the state considered the crime a misdemeanor. It fined Southland $56,000.    Florida has taken a much tougher stand. Under Southland-sponsored legislation, a company convicted of a felony can still hold licenses if it can show that no one associated with the crime is still associated with the company. In the past year, the state has revoked the licenses of one company that was convicted of a felony and failed to have its civil rights restored. Three other companies whose civil rights were restored were fined but allowed to keep their licenses.    The state has asked Southland to prove its case, questioning, in particular, the role of two current officers -- S. Richmond Dole, an executive vice president, and Clark J. Matthews II, chief financial officer -- who were indicted and ultimately acquitted in connection with the scheme.    To avoid that process, the company asked the governor and his cabinet for &quot;corporate clemency,&quot; arguing that the one guilty executive is long gone. A few days before its clemency hearing, Southland also settled a sales-tax dispute with the state by agreeing to pay $1.4 million in back taxes. But, citing lingering questions about the company's conviction, members of Gov. Bob Martinez's cabinet blocked the clemency bid in March.    In April, Southland and state officials argued their cases before a hearing officer, who is expected to recommend action to the state alcoholic beverages director in a month or two. Even if it keeps the licenses, the company also faces a fine of as much as $700,000.    &quot;I'm personally concerned about these areas,&quot; says Bill Gunter, state treasurer and insurance commissioner who opposed clemency. &quot;They are not the white hats they hold themselves up to be. There are some blemishes.&quot;    But Gregory Wallance, former assistant U.S. attorney who prosecuted Southland, says that even though the aftershocks of the conviction have been minor, he's convinced that image-conscious Southland paid a big penalty. &quot;They did not get off scot-free,&quot; Mr. Wallance says. &quot;They were branded by that conviction and that's significant punishment.&quot;    ---                Southland's Penalties California STORES AFFECTED ...........
