Mr. Stephens also said the company will report a charge ofabout $25 million for the year from a combination ofwrite-downs, accruals and gains.</LP><TEXT>   Most of the charge will be taken in the fourth quarter,which will result in earnings for that period &quot;significantlybelow&quot; the $52.7 million, or 37 cents a share, earned in the1989 fourth quarter. While declining to give a specificfigure, Mr. Stephens said in an interview that the companyhad a profitable fourth quarter, even after the charge.   In 1989, Manville had net income of $196.8 million, or$1.48 a share, and operating earnings of $360 million. Mr.Stephens declined to estimate how much the maker of wood,paper and fiberglass products earned in 1990. Through thefirst nine months of the year, it had net of $102.1 million,or 75 cents a share.   Manville will report fourth-quarter charges for severancepay from a planned work force reduction to &quot;get costs back inline with the current economic reality,&quot; Mr. Stephens said.He said he couldn't estimate how many layoffs there will beor how they will be distributed among the company's majorbusiness areas.   In addition, the company will take a charge for past andfuture expenses for restructuring its plan for financing theManville Personal Injury Settlement Trust, he said. The trustwas set up as part of Manville's Chapter 11 bankruptcy-lawreorganization plan to pay claims of asbestos victims. Thetrust and the company renegotiated that plan last year, as itbecame clear that the trust had run out of money to pay themore than 150,000 victims who have filed claims.   Under the new plan, the company will pay a dividend of$1.04 a share, or about $125 million, at the end of this yearif all legal challenges to the new trust plan are settled bythen. On a fully diluted basis, the trust holds 80% ofManville stock.   Mr. Stephens also said the company will take a write-downfor some overvalued plant and equipment.   Manville reported a pretax second-quarter gain of $15.7million from the sale of a business, although that has sincebeen adjusted to $20 million. That gain and the charges willresult in the after-tax charge of about $25 million, Mr.Stephens said.   Some of Manville's businesses were hit byrecession-related declines, notably automobiles andconstruction. The engineering products group, which makesfiberglass for automobile insulation and fiberglassreinforcement products, suffered the most.   The forest products unit, which makes paper and woodproducts, will report lower earnings. Still, the company'spaper business did well, outperforming its competitors, Mr.Stephens said. The industry's big players have indicated thatearnings last year fell 25% to 50%, he said.   The wood-products business is &quot;as bad as I've seen it in25 years,&quot; Mr. Stephens said. &quot;Prices are at or below cashcosts for many companies.&quot; He projected another tough year in1991 as a lack of capital hampers construction. &quot;Even themost optimistic projections are pessimistic,&quot; he said.   But Manville's building products group, which sellsbuilding insulation and roofing materials, performed ontarget in spite of the construction slowdown, and miningoperations did well. Those two groups should report 1990earnings about even with 1989 levels, he said.   Mr. Stephens said he is pleased that the company will paya dividend this year. &quot;We were prohibited under the old trustplan to pay dividends,&quot; he said. &quot;This is a step towardnormality.&quot;   Because of restrictions on the original trust agreement,the company has been unable to &quot;create shareholder value&quot; byusing cash to pay dividends, making it more difficult tomanage the company, Mr. Stephens said.   &quot;We were on the acquisition trail as an attempt to createshareholder value,&quot; he said. &quot;We think we will have a goodbalance now between {using cash} for the dividend and forgrowth.&quot;   The company's capital expenditures totaled $400 million in1990, about $100 million over target. A $65 millionfiberglass plant in Waterville, Ohio, is nearing completionand should be in production in April. Manville also improvedits other fiberglass plants with more energy-efficienttechnology and spent $40 million on a new system at its WestMonroe, La., paper plant that recovers chemicals from wastewater.   The forest products group made three acquisitions lastyear, buying a recycled paper mill in Sweden, a cartoncompany in England and a carton maker in Australia. Thepurchases were made with cash from earlier sales ofbusinesses and didn't require any borrowing, Mr. Stephenssaid.   &quot;Most of that spending is behind us,&quot; he said. Manvillewill have capital expenditures of $170 million in 1991, hesaid, close to its typical level of $180 million.</TEXT></DOC>
