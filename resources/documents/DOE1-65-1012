TheGovernment seems to believe that this high tech industry represents theway of the future for Canadian industry, and that it must, therefore,be supported. That is what the B.C. and federal governments were doingwhen they hosted the Defence Industry Opportunities Seminar in Vancouverin November 1982. The federal government hosted a similar military industryexposition in Ottawa in March 1983. In summary, military production andthe present pattern of military spending are seen by the Canadian Governmentto bestow benefits. Instead they extract a major price. Until we arewilling to calculate the full price of military production and the presentpattern of military spending, we will continue to pursue foolish policies,making short-sighted claims about short-term benefits, in the processtoward long-term devastation.</TEXT></DOC>
