A technique is developedto introduce explicitly the fraction defining the way in which the energyloss from the system is divided between the regions above and below thestairway. Finally, it is shown that a single empirical constant sufficesto complete relationships among key features of the processes of heatand mass transfer. The resulting formulae are suitable for incorporationwithin computer models of energy balances for complete buildings.</TEXT></DOC>
