Winds gusting to 80 mph knocked out power tothousands and toppled a partly built apartment building.   In Colorado, a wintry storm dumped up to 15 inches of snow,causing rush-hour traffic jams, dozens of accidents and the deathsof best-selling novelist Terrence Smith and another motorist,authorities said.   Snow continued falling today in Colorado, as well as in westernTexas, New Mexico and parts of Arizona.   No serious injuries were reported in Southern California due tothe hot, desert Santa Ana winds, which are expected to continuethrough Friday. But streets and yards were littered with snappedtree limbs and sparking power lines.   The worst fires were in the Los Angeles suburb of Baldwin Park,where a fire destroyed 15 homes and damaged five commercialbuildings, and in the east Los Angeles County community of La Verne,where fire destroyed 10 homes and damaged up to 15.   The blaze in Baldwin Park, a suburb 20 miles northeast ofdowntown, was contained at daybreak as the winds abated, said LosAngeles County fire Inspector Chuck Gutierrez.   The blaze broke out shortly after midnight, when power linessnapped by 75 mph gusts ignited paper at a paper plant, firefighterssaid. The wind quickly spread the embers through commercialbuildings, including a lumber yard and a Shell Oil distributioncenter, and into a neighborhood of modest single-family homes.   Approximately 100 residents were evacuated from the neighborhood.   ``Two homes next to us caught fire like a match and I'm sure oursis on fire too,'' said Hector Salas, 22. ``You know, all of usaround here, we don't have much. My father and mother were barelymaking it, and now it's all gone.''   Phil Estupinion, who shared a house with eight other relatives,said he returned to his home about an hour after being told bypolice to get out.   ``And the house was gone,'' he said. ``It wasn't there. It wasall burned up.''   In La Verne, a suburb up against the dry San Gabriel Mountains 30miles east of Los Angeles, some 300 people were evacuated from theneighborhood of $200,000 homes after the blaze began near a boys'home. The fire was contained after scorching 150 acres of brush.   ``It literally rained embers across roofs,'' said La Vernefirefighter Ron Sillo.   ``We lost everything _ the house, the cars,'' said Dan Hanlon,49, who fled with his wife, Jackie, down a fiery hillside. ``We werelucky to get out. We had to drive through flames.''   In Glendale, 10 miles north of Los Angeles, a wind-driven fireraced along a ridge, blackening about 100 acres of brush,threatening about 30 homes and prompting evacuation of about 50people.   Power was blacked out as winds snapped power lines. About 300,000Southern California Edison customers were without electricity at onetime or another, said company spokesman Dave Barron.   Hundreds of West Los Angeles residents were evacuated lateWednesday when the wind spread embers from a burning apartment houseproject to a nearby complex, said fire department spokesman GregAcevedo.   The fire raged for nearly two hours, displacing occupants of thefour-story building as flames climbed hundreds of feet into the air.   The Los Angeles County Fire Department placed firefighters onstandby in the parched canyon areas of Malibu and Lancaster in casefires flared, and a red-flag alert was called by the U.S. ForestService in the Angeles National Forest.   Rancho Cucamonga, where winds were clocked at 80 mph, appeared tobe the hardest hit Wednesday. The winds knocked down a three-storyapartment building under construction and blew the roofs off atleast two homes, officials said.   ``I always wanted a room with a skylight,'' Dolores Salazar saidruefully as she regarded the damage to her home.   Small fires were reported throughout the night in RanchoCucamonga, but all were controlled, said city emergency servicescoordinator Marti Higgins.   Wind-fanned flames in Hollywood gutted a two-story home andleaped to a neighboring residence Wednesday, said Acevedo.   The gusts blew a tree onto a car in the Orange County city ofSanta Ana, and knocked over a 30-foot motor home on the FoothillFreeway near San Dimas, causing a traffic jam.   In Colorado, the storm was subsiding in most areas today afterleaving 15 inches of snow west of Fort Collins, 4 inches in ColoradoSprings and Denver and 2 inches in Pueblo.   Flights were delayed at Stapleton International Airport in Denverabout 90 minutes throughout the day Wednesday, but it was back tonormal today, said airport spokesman Richard Boulware.   Roads that were wet Wednesday morning were sheets of ice byafternoon before being covered by snow, producing evening rush-hourtraffic jams in the Denver area, Boulder and Fort Collins.   ``It's a total mess everywhere,'' said Denver police Sgt. MiltGras.   Smith, 46, of Woodland Park and a 42-year-old Woodmoor woman werekilled in separate accidents, authorities said. Smith, author of``The Thief Who Came To Dinner'' and several other novels, died whenhis van spun on ice on U.S. 24 and hit a car.   There were 38 accidents in Fort Collins alone by 8 p.m., and inDenver motorists were asked to report minor crack-ups later.   For the homeless at the Samaritan Shelter north of downtownDenver, the storm meant more than discomfort.   Danna Morgan, 22, a single mother, struggled to keep her11-month-old son warm. ``You have to leave (shelters) early in themorning, unless you are on the sick list. ... We walk around in thesnow,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
