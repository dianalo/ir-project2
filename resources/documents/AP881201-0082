No pickup.^By GREG MYRE</NOTE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Black residents today announceda consumer boycott of white-owned stores in Boksburg, one of severaltowns where right-wing officials have reimposed strict apartheidmeasures.   ``The (Conservative Party) wants to keep its town white. We aregoing to grant them their Christmas wish,'' said Buchanan Jantjes,who heads the management committee in Boksburg's mixed-race townshipof Reiger Park. Jantjes also told reporters blacks and people ofmixed-race would stage a sit-in Friday at Boksburg Lake, whichrecently was reserved for whites.   Four South African sporting bodies announced sanctions againsttowns attempting to increase race segregation.   Governing organizations for cricket, golf, cycling and men'sfield hockey in separate statements said they have canceledcompetitions or will refuse to give funds to towns, schools andclubs that encourage discrimination.   Also today, a handcuffed black teen-ager plunged to his deathfrom the seventh floor of an apartment building while in the custodyof police investigators who alleged he was a guerrilla, the policecommissioner said.   The Conservative Party, which captured dozens of town councils inOct. 26 elections, has touched off a storm of controversy with itsefforts to ban blacks from public facilities integrated in recentyears.   This week three councils in towns outside Johannesburg _Boksburg, Brakpan and Carletonville _ have voted to resegregateparks, town halls and swimming pools and to bar blacks from owningbusinesses in town. Other communities announced similar plans.   The Conservatives view limited race reforms by President P.W.Botha's National Party as capitulation to the nation's 26-millionblack majority.   Jantjes predicted the boycott ``will be disastrous forBoksburg,'' whose white businessmen depend heavily on the town'smore than 150,000 blacks and people of mixed-race. Boksburg has87,000 whites.   Mayor Beyers de Klerk vowed not to soften his stance.   ``I am here to fight to survive and I expect all the thunderboltsin hell to rain down on me,'' he said.   Meanwhile Botha restated his party policy of segregatedneighborhoods. ``The government maintains its position, namely themaintenance of own communities for every population group,'' he saidWednesday night.   Minister of Constitutional Development Chris Heunis warned towncouncils not to ``sabotage'' national policy.   ``Such ill-considered action by irresponsible people can in oneday destroy attitudes and relationships that have been built upthrough years of hard work,'' Heunis said.   He gave no indication the government planned to change lawsallowing local authorities to discriminate.   Newspapers accused the government of hypocrisy, noting NationalParty-controlled cities maintain segregated facilities ranging frombuses to beaches.   Regarding the death of the black suspect, Gen. Hennie de Wittsaid Amos Khoza, 18, ``managed to throw himself over a wall andconsequently fell to his death.'' De Witt said a high-rankingofficer would investigate the incident.   De Witt's statement said Khoza was arrested today in Klerksdorp,a town west of Johannesburg, because police believed he had``terrorist weapons.''   Khoza was brought to central Johannesburg to identify anapartment where he purportedly made contact with a member of theAfrican National Congress guerrilla movement, de Witt said. De Wittsaid Khoza was recruited by the outlawed ANC and was to havereceived guerrilla training abroad.   There have been numerous incidents in recent years where suspectshave died while in the company of police investigators. Police saysome were shot and killed while trying to escape and others leapedto their deaths from windows.   Also today, police reported five black men were stabbed to deathin separate attacks in strife-torn townships near southeasternPietermaritzburg city. Four men were arrested in the attacks.</TEXT></DOC>
