The frigid air mass that spilled into the lower 48 states fromAlaska earlier in the week brought more snow today to theweather-weary Pacific Northwest and northern states, threateningcrops and endangering newborn livestock.   Many cities stepped up aid to the homeless. At Paducah, Texas,hundreds of people were left without heat when a 4-inch natural gaspipeline ruptured. Temperatures were in the single digits at Paducahand residents were told to move to electrically heated buildings.   The cold spell has closed schools, disrupted travel, and causedpower outages at a time when electricity is in high demand.Wind-chill readings between 60 and 80 degrees below zero were commonacross much of Montana and the Dakotas.   Stretching across a roughly triangular area from the PacificNorthwest to Texas to New England, the air mass is pushingsouthward, but at a slower pace than earlier in the week, said BrianSmith of the National Weather Service.   ``It's moving quite a bit slower now. We're not getting thereally rapid changes in temperatures that we were,'' Smith saidtoday.   Overnight lows today were below zero all the way south to themiddle Mississippi Valley, with readings between 20 below zero and38 below zero over the Dakotas, Wyoming, much of Montana, Minnesotaand northwestern Nebraska, the weather service said. Austin, Texas,fell from a high Thursday of 69 to a low today of 28, and a freezewarning was posted tonight for the lower Rio Grande Valley.   Record lows were scattered from Oregon to Iowa, including 33below zero at Great Falls, Mont.   The below-normal temperatures are expected to linger until themiddle of next week.   Schools in Montana, Nebraska, Washington state, Kansas, New York,Oklahoma, Colorado, Texas and elsewhere told students to stay hometoday because of the snow and cold.   ``There's no sense messing with this stuff,'' said Oswego, Kan.,school Superintendent Ed Sink, who closed his schools.   Montana state government employees returned to work today afterbeing sent home because of the weather at midday Thursday by Gov.Stan Stephens. The capital, Helena, also had to cope with a trainexplosion that forced the daylong evacuation of thousands of peopleand left some without power with 38 below zero temperatures.   The cold chased out what had been an unusually warm January inmany parts of the country. Bostonians enjoyed a record-high 66degrees Wednesday. Twenty-four hours later, the city shivered in 31degrees and freezing rain.   At the same time as northern states experienced staggering lowson Thursday, the southeast corner of the nation was hitting recordhighs. Nearly 30 records were set, including 80 degrees inCharlotte, N.C.; Norfolk, Va., 80; and Wilmington, N.C., 80.   Two school buses collided on an icy school parking lot today inIndianapolis and 16 students suffered minor injuries, authoritiessaid.   At least seven traffic fatalities were blamed on the weather,which slickened highways in a band of freezing rain from Texas toVermont. In Edmonds, Wash., a utility worker died Thursday when hefell while trying to repair a downed power line.   Two men died of exposure, one in Martin, S.D., and the other inGreat Falls, Mont. And in Washington state, four sledding deathswere reported.   But a life was saved in North Dakota when searchers Thursdayfound a 16-year-old boy who got stranded three days before whiledriving to his family's farm. Bennett Stebleton of rural Egeland hadonly a stocking cap, light jacket, sweatshirt and car mats to keephim warm.   ``He's quite a courageous young man,'' said Dr. William Norbergat St. Luke's Hospital in Fargo, where Stebleton was taken withfrostbitten feet and hands. Overnight temperatures in the area hadplunged to 30 degrees below zero.   The Alaskan air mass also delivered a rare snowfall to parts ofnorthern California.   ``There was snow right down to the beach in Trinidad Harbor,''Yvonne Lewis, deputy city clerk at the tiny fishing town 300 milesnorth of San Francisco, said late Thursday. ``It was nice; the kidsloved it.''   Farmers in Washington state worried that the cold would damagetheir fruit trees. Some growers in the Yakima Valley activated windmachines in orchards, said extension agent Mike Willett. Themachines are designed to draw warmer air from 50 to 100 feet abovethe ground down into orchards, he said.   Montana ranchers said cattle were giving birth to calves thatdied from exposure within hours.   One rancher, Dr. George Ingham, said he lost two calves.   ``We had one up and nursing, and came back and that big100-pounder was dead,'' Ingham said. ``It's the wind chill out onthis prairie.''   Sheep ranchers in Oregon were worried about newborn lambs.   ``You've got to stay right on them or they'll freeze as soon asthey hit the ground,'' said rancher Curtis McBeth.</TEXT></DOC>
