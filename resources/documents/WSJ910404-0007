The first sanctions to go probably would be those hurtingsuch labor-intensive industries as agriculture and coal,which employ large numbers of black workers, the U.S.official said in an interview. &quot;The black unemployment issueis our highest priority,&quot; he said. New U.S. investmentprobably also would be allowed soon, because that also wouldhelp create jobs.</LP><TEXT>   Congress imposed economic sanctions to try to pressureSouth Africa to abandon the apartheid policy of oppression ofits majority black population. The ComprehensiveAnti-Apartheid Act of 1986 says the U.S. sanctions will endwhen five conditions are met.   The president may move to suspend or modify any of thesanctions after South Africa has met four of the fiveconditions, including the release of political prisoners, andafter he certifies that South Africa has &quot;made substantialprogress toward dismantling the system of apartheid andestablishing a non-racial democracy.&quot;   Under an agreement between the South African governmentand the African National Congress, the major anti-apartheidorganization, South Africa's remaining political prisonersare scheduled for release by April 30. When they arereleased, President Bush will &quot;move forward promptly&quot; torelax sanctions, Mr. Cohen predicted. The relaxation willtake effect unless the U.S. Congress rejects the move within30 days of being notified by the president.   After the prisoner release is complete, the only conditionthat will remain unmet in Washington's view is the repeal ofthe Group Areas Act, which sets out where South Africans canlive, on a racially segregated basis, and of the PopulationRegistration Act, which categorizes people by race. SouthAfrican President F.W. de Klerk proposed the repeal of theseacts in February, though he indicated population registrationwould be phased out.   Sanctions will not be relaxed without a fight on CapitolHill. House Majority Whip William Gray (D., Pa.) argued in arecent letter to the U.S. secretary of state that the law'srequirements have not been met sufficiently. Rep. RonaldDellums (D., Calif.), in a letter to his colleagues, said:&quot;Despite reforms, apartheid remains intact. No democracyexists&quot; in South Africa.   Mr. Dellums said, among other things, that the thirdcondition of the Anti-Apartheid Act -- the removal of a banon political parties and freedom for all South Africans to&quot;participate in the political process&quot; -- has been onlypartly met. Political parties, such as the African NationalCongress, now are legal, but &quot;black South Africans clearlycannot run for elected office, nor do they have the right tovote,&quot; his letter said.   The ANC opposes lifting sanctions until after an interimgovernment that includes black politicians has been formed.However, ANC leaders have indicated that if a relaxation ofsanctions becomes inevitable, they want to have a say inwhich sanctions are lifted first, according to a participantin meetings with Mr. Cohen here.   Mr. Cohen and nearly 20 members of Congress are here forprivate meetings with South African leaders organized by theAspen Institute.   In remarks during one session, Mr. Cohen said the PeaceCorps could be used to help rural development in South Africaeven if sanctions are not lifted, according to one conferenceparticipant.</TEXT></DOC>
