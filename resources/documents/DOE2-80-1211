This programme provides for the surfacestorage of short-lived low- and medium-level wastes ('A' wastes), andthe underground storage of alpha wastes and of high-level vitrified wastes('B' and 'C' wastes). The storage facilities constitute basic nuclearinstallations subject to the corresponding regulations. The process ofselecting an underground storage site comprises several stages: (1) geologicalsurvey and preliminary selection of potentially suitable areas; (2) geologicalappraisal of these areas by means of deep drilling; (3) selection ofa site and establishment within it of an underground laboratory to determinethe storage parameters; (4) licensing, construction and commissioningprocedures. In parallel with this programme, the French Government hasmade the necessary arrangements to gather the technical data to enableit, at the appropriate time, to give a judgement on the quality of proposedsites. Thus, in April 1985, the Minister for Industry requested ProfessorGoguel to head a working group with the task of proposing technical criteriafor the selection of deep sites. In June 1987 the group submitted itsreport, the main substance and conclusions of which are presented inthis paper. The group formulated technical criteria for the whole rangeof problems involved: hydrogeology, geochemistry, planning and executionof the work, consequences of disruptive external events, site reconnaissanceand qualification programmes. Radiological safety objectives, based onthe ICRP recommendations for radioactive wastes, have taken a prominentplace in the group's deliberations.</TEXT></DOC>
