Fighting raged from nightfall Sunday to daybreak today in themountaintop town of Souk el-Gharb, where Syrian troops and Drusemilitiamen surrounded a Christian army garrison, police said.   Mortar and tank cannon rounds crashed in Christian and Drusevillages around Souk el-Gharb, wounding seven villagers, policesaid.   Two Lebanese soldiers also died in the fighting, the firstfatalities reported by officials since a truce went into effectFriday in an Arab League-mediated attempt to halt eight weeks ofbloodshed.   ``This is the gravest violation of the truce. It's worse thanthe sporadic bombardment of the coastline of the Christian enclavein the past two days,'' according to a police spokesman said.   ``The coastal shelling underlined the dispute over blockadedseaports, but the fighting in Souk el-Gharb has wider dimensionsthat could undermine the Arab League's peace plan altogether,'' hesaid. He spoke on condition of anonymity.   Souk el-Gharb sits atop a strategic network of mountain roadsleading from the Druse hinterland southeast of Beirut to theChristian heartland north and northeast of the capital. If theChristian-controlled town falls to the allied Syrians and Druse,Christians would lose the central mountain stronghold shieldingtheir 310-square-mile enclave.   The latest casualties increased the overall toll to 275 peoplekilled and 1,000 wounded since March 6, when army commander Gen.Michel Aoun's 20,000 mainly Christian troops blocked illegal Moslemmilitia-run ports. The Syrian-Druse alliance responded byblockading the Christian enclave.   A spokesman at Aoun's command claimed the Syrian army andmilitiamen of Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt's Progressive SocialistParty were ``trying to provoke us into a mass retaliation toundermine the Arab League's cease-fire.''   ``But the general is determined to strip them from that excuse.We're not responding,'' said the spokesman, who requested anonymity.   He said Aoun's army was merely defending front positions and wasnot shelling Moslem residential areas or distant Syrian targets.   Jumblatt, meanwhile, issued a May Day statement calling forAoun's removal from power as a condition for peace.   ``It's impossible to reach a compromise with Michel Aoun. Hemust be removed or toppled,'' said Jumblatt. ``This must be clearto all other Christian leaderships.''   The political and military wrangling underlined a dispute overthe second provision of the latest cease-fire that calls for thelifting of air, land and sea blockades.   Aoun, who heads a Christian military Cabinet in Lebanon's dualgovernment, refused to call off the blockade of illegal harbors,which he says deprive the state of $100 million yearly in losttaxes. He said his gunboats and helicopter gunships were applyingLebanese laws.   But the rival Moslem Cabinet under acting Prime Minister SalimHoss has insisted Aoun's blockade be lifted.</TEXT></DOC>
