Lane Sr. and his sons, Bill and Mel, hiredMellquist to be the managing editor of the monthly do-it-yourself magazine in1950, it was a 22-year-old regional periodical reaching 500,000 subscribers.;  On Mellquist's retirement in 1982, 1.3 million people were spending $12 ayear to read Sunset's advice about how to live in the West.;   He becameeditor in 1954, one of only three &quot;very gifted&quot; editors during the 62 yearsthe magazine was published by the Lane family, said Bill Lane, its publisheruntil it was acquired by Time-Warner Co. in 1990. Mellquist succeeded WalterDoty. Twenty-eight years later, he turned over his duties to Bill Marken, whoretains the position.;   &quot;There's a lot of people at Sunset who spent theirwhole careers here,&quot; said Marken, who was trained by Mellquist. &quot;What welearned about magazines, we learned from him -- clear, simple presentations togive our readers good ideas.&quot;;   Lane saw compassion in his former editor. He&quot;had tremendous respect from his staff, almost a love. But he was very firm.You would not equate Milquetoast with Mellquist. He had a definite set ofstandards.&quot;;   Those standards included strong opinions about the color coverof the magazine, recalled Al Zelver, a friend of Mellquist's for 52 years anda Sunset editor for five years in the 1950s.;   &quot;Once a month, everybody wouldstand around and talk about what would go on the cover.&quot; Zelver said. &quot;Itwasn't for years that I discovered that Proc was color blind.&quot;;   Bill Cheney,Sunset art director who worked with Mellquist for years, said, &quot;Proc Mellquisthad stroke of genius in putting together a magazine. He was a very good photoeditor, and a bit of art director himself.&quot;;   In his early years, &quot;he wasliving the life of the readers,&quot; Cheney said. &quot;He was building his home; hisfriends were architects; he stressed the architectural and planning&quot; aspect ofthe magazine's message.;   Mellquist was instrumental in establishing theWestern Home Award Program, which the magazine co-sponsors with the AmericanInstitute of Architecture and is now 35 years old. The juried selectionsfeature the best of Western residential architecture every other year.;  Mellquist carried his interest in planning to government service. He was aplanning commissioner of Los Altos Hills for the first nine years after itsincorporation in 1956.;   He was also chairman of the advisory board for SanFrancisco's Ghirardelli Square in the 1960s and was a director of CaliforniaTomorrow, an organization concerned with growth problems and conservation.;Proctor Mellquist; (box)Born: Aug. 14, 1915, Leavenworth, Kan.; (box)Died:Sept. 3, 1991, Palo Alto, Calif.; (box)Survived by: Wife, the former AliceStauffacher of Los Altos Hills; son, John Mellquist of Vershire, Vt.;daughter, Susan Warton of Redwood City; four grandchildren; onegreat-grandchild.; (box)Services: Private.; (box)Memorial: Donations may bemade to the Peninsula Open Space Trust, Building 4, Suite 135, 3000 Sand HillRoad, Menlo Park 94025.  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Alameda County/Am  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910906  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  8B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  594  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday, September 6, 199100250157,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
