The executive, Thomas O. Pyle, had been pressured toresign by staff physicians who were unhappy with a plan bythe HMO's management to implement new workload requirementsand base the physicians' pay partly on how many patients theysee. Mr. Pyle, who had been the HMO's chief executive since1978, wasn't available for comment. Under his leadership, theHMO had grown to become the nation's seventh-largest, withabout 535,000 members in Massachusetts, Rhode Island and NewHampshire.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Pyle's resignation &quot;is an amazing surprise,&quot; saidRobert Blendon, a professor of health policy and managementat the Harvard School of Public Health, which isn't connectedwith the HMO. &quot;He's considered the Henry Ford of the HMOindustry in the Northeast.&quot; Among other things, the HarvardHMO was recognized nationally during Mr. Pyle's tenure fordeveloping policies to ensure health-care quality.   Mr. Pyle's resignation underscores tensions that havedeveloped at many health-care organizations as competitionfor corporate and individual customers has intensified andpressures have mounted to control costs. In August, topexecutives at Bay State Health Care, another largeBoston-area HMO, resigned after a similar dispute concerningphysician compensation.   The dispute at the Harvard HMO was sparked largely by aplan to base 5% of its staff physicians' pay on a set of 10performance factors, including the number of patient visitsthey handle, and evaluations by superiors and patients. Theamount of pay based on such factors would rise to 15% overthe next two years.   The doctors' revolt at the HMO came to a head earlier thisweek when about 300 of its approximately 600 staff physiciansmet with the HMO's board to discuss the new compensationplans and performance measures. After the meeting, &quot;there wasa sense it was unlikely that a productive future could occurat the HMO because of the intense emotion and communicationproblems&quot; between Mr. Pyle and the HMO's doctors, said EugeneLindsey, chairman of an internal group representingphysicians at the HMO. &quot;I think {Mr. Pyle} felt the samething.&quot;   A number of HMOs have adopted compensation rules tyingphysician pay to performance measures, including the numberof patients handled. But the Harvard HMO, one of the nation'soldest such organizations, &quot;is supposed to be a special placefor special people,&quot; said Dr. Blendon, the Harvard Universityprofessor. Thus, physicians at the HMO have had highexpectations for sharing power with management.</TEXT></DOC>
