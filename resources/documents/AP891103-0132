The wave of protests in Kosovo, Yugoslavia's poorest region, wassparked by the trial of a popular former communist chief, AzemVlasi, and 14 other leaders of the province's ethnic Albanianmajority.   More than 500 villagers tried to force their way into the centerof Podujevo, 20 miles north of Pristina, sources said on conditionof anonymity. Security forces blocked off a local road wheredemonstrators were marching and used tear gas in a bid to dispersethem.   The government's Tanjug news agency said the demonstrators andthe security forces clashed, and sources said gunshots were heard,but no other details of the incident were reported.   A demonstration by about 150 school children was also reportedin the town of Suva Reka, 40 miles south of Pristina. Thedemonstrators dispersed as soon as riot police took up positions infront of them, a witness said.   Riot police and armored vehicles were out in force in the centerof Pristina, the capital of Kosovo province, where they dispersed70 people who were attempting to stage a demonstration.   Police said a shootout with ``terrorists'' Thursday night endedwhen a 26-year-old railroad worker committed suicide while anotherunindentified man died of wounds inflicted by police and was foundwith an explosive device.   The railroad worker, Fahri Fazliu, was a ringleader duringprevious demonstrations and was followed by police Thursday to anapartment complex after he tried to organize new riots, police said.   Earlier reports had said four people holed up in the basementdied in a six-hour shootout with police.   An ethnic Albanian identified as Bedri Sokilji was shot andkilled Wednesday night when about 1,000 demonstrators took to thestreets in Pristina and some battled with security forces.   Sources close to the police said security forces throughout theprovince neighboring Communist Albania were put on extra alert.   Fearing more unrest by the ethnic Albanian majority in theprovince, a heavy police presence was evident on streets of mostKosovo towns which have for the past five days been the scene ofviolent clashes between demonstrators and security forces.   Riot policemen wearing helmets and bulletproof vests andcarrying submachine guns patrolled downtown Pristina.   The latest unrest was sparked by the trial of Vlasi and 14 otherdefendents on charges of engaging in ``counterrevolutionaryactivity'' to win Kosovo's independence from Yugoslavia. They couldface the death penalty.   The trial, began Monday but was postponed for at least 10 dayswhile an appeals courts rules on a demand by Vlasi and his lawyersfor the exclusion of the presiding judge and the public prosecutor.   Officials and the media in Yugoslavia's liberal northernrepublics, as well as international human rights organizations,have denounced the proceedings, describing them as a ``farce'' anda ``show trial.''   Vlasi also is charged with inciting riots in February and Marchthat left at least 25 people dead, including two policemen.   Albanians were angry over the passage of a constitutionalamendment last spring that gave Yugoslavia's largest republic ofSerbia tight control over the police and judiciary in Kosovo, aprovince within Serbia.   The Serbian leadership claimed the amendments will preventalleged harassment of the Slav minority by the ethnic Albanians,who make up more than 85 percent of Kosovo's population.   Kosovo's communist party leadership on Friday assessed thelatest spate of unrest in Kosovo as ``the continuation ofcounterrevolutionary activities'' by ethnic Albanians ``aimed atthe secession of Kosovo from Yugoslavia.''</TEXT></DOC>
