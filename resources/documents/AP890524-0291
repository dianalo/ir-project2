Voting 17-14, the committee adopted an amendment by Rep. WilliamJ. Hughes, D-N.J., to reduce the proposed new civil penalties to$500,000 for each violation and to a maximum of $2.5 millionagainst any one individual.   As part of his $90 billion Sandamp;L bailout package, Bush had soughtto raise the civil penalties for defrauding banks, thrifts andother financial institutions backed by federal deposit insurancefrom the current maximum of $5,000 to $1 million for each violation.   Hughes said his amendment, which was backed by the AmericanBankers Association but opposed by the administration, was intendedto make the civil penalties ``remedial rather than punitive.''   Opponents, however, said the effect will be to reduce thegovernment's ability to recover billions of dollars in federaldeposit insurance funds that might be lost in the future to insiderloans, fraud and embezzlement _ the major contibutors to thecurrent Sandamp;L crisis.   ``The taxpayers are going to have to fork up $300 billionbecause of a bunch of high rollers,'' said Rep. Romano L. Mazzoli,D-Ky. He referred to the interest costs over the 30 years for thetaxpayer share of Bush's bailout plan.   ``I don't think we should be worrying about remedializingthem,'' Mazzoli said of fraudulent Sandamp;L operators. ``We should worryabout punishing them.''   Five of the Judiciary Committee's 21 Democrats, includingHughes, and 12 of its 14 Republicans supported the amendment.   Although Bush got all he wanted and more from the Senate and theHouse Banking Committee in seeking to make Sandamp;L owners put more oftheir own money at risk, he faced new opposition to that as welltoday from members of his own party.   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said he would offer an amendment todaybefore the House Judiciary Committee to make Sandamp;L regulators gothrough lengthy hearings before making thrift operators put upbillions of dollars in new capital.   Robert Glauber, Bush's No. 2 official at the TreasuryDepartment, called Hyde's measure ``a grave error.''   Bush's proposal, approved by both the full Senate and the HouseBanking Committee, would raise from the current five years to 20years the maximum sentence for bank and Sandamp;L fraud and embezzlement.The maximum fine would rise from $5,000 to $1 million.   Fraud has been blamed by the General Accounting Office,regulatory officials and the Justice Department as the singlebiggest contributor to what has become the nation's largestfinancial crisis since the Depression.   The legislation is the price the administration is demanding fora $90 billion bailout of the industry.   Bush jumped into the fray Tuesday, asking House leaders in aletter ``to hold absolutely firm against any attempt to weakenthose vital elements ... which protect the American taxpayer fromadditional costs.''   ``Now is the time for the House to act,'' Bush said in identicalletters to House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, Democratic Leader TomFoley of Washington, Democratic Whip Tony Coelho of California,House Republican Leader Bob Michel of Illinois and House GOP WhipNewt Gingrich of Georgia.   ``Bipartisan majorities in both the Senate and House havedefeated determined special interest lobbying against the toughcapital standards needed to protect American taxpayers from arepeat of this tragedy,'' he said.   Hyde denied his measure is an attempt to weaken the capitalstandards adopted earlier this month by the banking committee.   ``We're not touching the capital requirements at all,'' he said.``An effort will be made to provide for hearings under theAdministrative Procedures Act so that Sandamp;Ls affected by the newcapital structure requirements will have an opportunity to get dueprocess.''   But Rep. Bruce Morrison, D-Conn., a member of both the judiciaryand banking committees, described the proposal as a ``back-doorattempt to undercut the ability of the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorporation to enforce the capital standards.''   ``If we create a whole scheme of appeals and litigation toprevent the FDIC from enforcing the standards, then we'll haveanother run on the taxpayers because we won't have real moneyrepresenting these institutions.''   The 51-member banking committee approved the bill three weeksago, two weeks after it was approved by the full Senate. The HouseWays and Means Committee last week changed Bush's proposal to makethe $50 billion taxpayer share of the bailout part of the federaldeficit over the next three years.   After the House Judiciary Committee completes its action, thebill still has to go before the House Government OperationsCommittee and the House Rules Committee before reaching the Housefloor for action there _ now anticipated the second week of June.</TEXT></DOC>
