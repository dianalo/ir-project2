In the developing world, climatic and economicconditions can permit much higher margins of cost-effectiveness for renewableenergy systems and thus provide market opportunities that do not existin the climatic and economic conditions prevalent in Canada. Examplesof such conditions are given in this paper, and they include countrieswith high fuel or utility prices, and countries where solar or wind energyis found in great abundance. Other considerations in penetrating thismarket are discussed; these include maintenance of energy facilities,legal aspects, communications and transportation problems, and availabilityof financing. The role of aid agencies in the latter regard is outlined.Target markets are identified, and possiblilities include small hydro,solar, and wind power generation in the Caribbean, and solar air conditioningin India. 3 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
