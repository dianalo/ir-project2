Mr. Bracken had been president of ad agency Ogilvy andamp; Mather Partners, an Ogilvy Group Inc. unit that he founded, until 1985. Since then, he has been an independent consultant for marketing companies, including Arnell/Bickford. His appointment as the agency's president will be announced next week.    Arnell/Bickford, formed in 1983, is a small but hot agency with clients including designer Donna Karan, Vanity Fair magazine, Sperry andamp; Hutchinson and European American Bank. Its founders, Peter Arnell, 28, and Ted Bickford, 30, started out as architects, apprenticing under Michael Graves, and they still do most of the agency's creative work themselves.    Mr. Bickford, who had been president, becomes co-chairman with Mr. Arnell, who had been secretary-treasurer.    In an interview, Mr. Bracken said his appointment &quot;will give us the kind of day-to-day means to grow the business.&quot; He said he will oversee the expanding agency's organization and business management, something the founders have little experience with. Mr. Bracken, who has been in the advertising business for 30 years, declined to give his age.    With Mr. Bracken's appointment, Arnell/Bickford begins the difficult task of attempting a transition from a small boutique agency into a full-service agency that can serve larger clients. In recent months, the agency has started media and client services departments, and it is now trying to break out of its reputation as an agency specializing in fashion clients. &quot;We want to be able to move into other categories,&quot; Mr. Arnell said.    Mr. Bracken first met Messrs. Arnell and Bickford in 1985, when he negotiated to buy their then-new agency for his Ogilvy andamp; Mather Partners. At the time, both agencies were wooing retailer Nieman-Marcus as a client, and Mr. Bracken envisioned Arnell/Bickford doing the creative work while Ogilvy would handle the backup services. Merger talks broke down, however, after Arnell/Bickford was awarded all of the business. Ogilvy andamp; Mather Partners later was folded into the New York office of the Ogilvy andamp; Mather ad agency. </TEXT></DOC>
