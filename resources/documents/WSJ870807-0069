The announcement followed an all-day board meeting and came two days after the Colorado Springs, Colo., company said Mr. Buchsbaum was delaying the proposed buy-out because of a series of death threats delivered to him and his family.    Last night, Holly said it ended the pact because the group, Arcanum I Partners, was &quot;not prepared to execute a merger agreement or transfer the assets&quot; as required by the buy-out accord.    Mr. Buchsbaum resigned &quot;as a result of concern for his family,&quot; Holly said. Mr. Buchsbaum, who became chairman in 1981, will remain a director, however.    Mr. Buchsbaum originally was supposed to sign an agreement to acquire Holly by July 24, two days after the board first approved the acquisition by Arcanum. At the time of the signing, Arcanum was to deliver its 94,600 Holly common shares and $10.5 million.    The deadline for the signing was extended several times, however, and the company then disclosed the buy-out would be further delayed because of the death threats, which Mr. Buchsbaum had said began last week. The Federal Bureau of Investigation opened an investigation of the threats.    Certain Holly directors and others familiar with the transaction were understood to be skeptical about the threats because they represented the latest in a series of impediments to the completion of the proposed transaction.    For example, after Holly's board approved the buy-out, individuals familiar with the proposed transaction said, Mr. Buchsbaum and Arcanum's lawyer informed the company that certain problems had arisen, preventing Mr. Buchsbaum from transferring the money. Mr. Buchsbaum apparently said at one point that he didn't have the money in cash but that he had it in bonds that couldn't immediately be liquidated.    Last night, a Holly spokesman declined to elaborate on the company's brief statement. A recorded message on Mr. Buchsbaum's phone in Larkspur, Calif., said he was unavailable.    Mr. Buchsbaum, a former Wall Street trader and stock speculator, wrested control of Holly from its previous management in a 1981 proxy fight. Holly is one of the nation's largest processors of sugar beets, which are purchased from independent growers. The termination of the buyout proposal is the latest in a long history of failed efforts by him to take the company private and ward off other suitors. Mr. Buchsbaum first said early in 1982 that he would try to take the company private in a leveraged buyout.    When Holly's board approved Arcanum's buy-out plan, directors retained the right to cancel the agreement if financing hadn't been completed by yesterday. Arcanum had said it was &quot;highly confident&quot; that National Westminster Bank USA and other banks would provide a credit facility of $80 million to back the transaction. National Westminster officials didn't return calls seeking comment yesterday.    With the termination of Mr. Buchsbaum's bid, two former Holly suitors could step back into the picture. Brookehill Equities Inc., a New York money management firm, holds 12.7% of Holly, and Shamrock Holdings of California Inc., a Burbank investment firm, owns 9%.    Brookehill officials couldn't be reached last night. Last month, Brookehill signed an agreement to withdraw its own bid for Holly in return for receiving money from Holly to cover expenses related to its takeover attempt.    A spokeswoman for Shamrock declined to comment on the latest development. Shamrock is controlled by members of the Roy E. Disney family.    Arcanum's proposal called for Holly to pay $40 cash plus a $90 face amount 11 1/2% convertible debenture for each share it doesn't already own. Arcanum owns about 94,600 of Holly's 1,121,493 shares outstanding, giving the proposed acquisition of the remaining shares an indicated value of about $134 million.    Holly Sugar shares rose $1, to $90.50, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. </TEXT></DOC>
