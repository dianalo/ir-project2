Today the foreign share is about 40%, but although there's cause for concern, Congress and the Reagan administration can't seem to get together to reverse the trend.    &quot;You have to ask why they don't do something,&quot; says Charles DiBona, president of the American Petroleum Institute, the domestic oil industry's leading trade group. Although Mr. DiBona has a direct interest in seeing imports' share of the U.S. market diminish, his complaint is shared by many experts outside the industry.    &quot;We aren't doing anything to make foreign oil less important,&quot; says Eli Bergman, executive director of Americans for Energy Independence, a private foundation.    Interior Secretary Donald Hodel predicts the return of gasoline lines in as little as two years. Failing to curb imports, he says, is like telling oil-producing countries, &quot;Take advantage of us, we're not going to defend ourselves.&quot; The Fund for Renewable Energy and the Environment, a coalition of environmental groups and supporters of alternative energy sources, who seldom agree with Mr. Hodel, warns that the U.S. is failing to prepare for &quot;inevitable&quot; oil price increases that &quot;could well imperil the national economy and the country's security.&quot;    The difficulty is reaching agreement on what to do. The oil industry and some others want to encourage increased U.S. production by means of an oil-import fee or with tax incentives. But a price-raising import fee or tax breaks for the oil industry raise steep political hurdles in the form of strong opposition from oil-consuming interests. Meanwhile, environmentalists' proposals to stimulate conservation and increase use of substitute fuels are blocked by the administration.    Currently stirring controversy is a proposal by Senate Finance Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas). He recently got his committee to amend the pending trade bill to require the president to do whatever is necessary to keep oil imports from exceeding 50% of the U.S. supply, subject to congressional veto. But New Englanders and Midwesterners oppose the amendment as a backdoor route to an import fee that would raise fuel costs. &quot;It's simply unfair,&quot; says Sen. John Chafee, (R., R.I.), whose constituents get two-thirds of their energy from oil.    The problem will worsen, forecasters say. Oil imports are expected to top 50% of the U.S. supply between 1990 and 1995. That would heighten the importance of the volatile Persian Gulf. Although the U.S. now gets only about 6% of its oil from the gulf, that region is expected to dominate world oil markets in the 1990s when the current world oil glut is expected to be over.    Congress has made small energy-conservation moves. It passed a bill, reluctantly signed by President Reagan, reinstating appliance-efficiency standards. The House currently is exploring ways of diverting 2% of all oil imports into the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and there has been talk of a gasoline tax that would be used to help cut the budget deficit while discouraging consumption.    Although administration officials say the president has supported &quot;appropriate&quot; responses to the oil-import problem, such as lifting the oil-industry's &quot;windfall&quot; profits tax and opening more federal lands to drilling, industry leaders are skeptical that much will be done. David Wilson, president of the Independent Petroleum Association of Mountain States, says that both Congress and the administration &quot;are hoping the situation will go away without action on their part.&quot;    Just last month, Mr. Reagan killed a seven-month drive by some administration officials to get him to take strong new action. The Energy Department urged the president to propose tax credits and quick expensing of oil-exploration costs totaling $560 million to $960 million annually. It projected these would boost domestic production after five years by 500,000 barrels a day, or about 6%.    According to Mr. Hodel, some cabinet members were loath to open last year's tax law to assaults by special interests. Top officials also balked, insiders say, at the cost of tax breaks and the difficulty of pushing them through Congress.    Also scrapped was an Energy Department plan to buy more oil for the strategic reserve. It urged that private investors be allowed to own the oil through government-backed securities. Instead, Mr. Reagan said he would support tripling his proposed purchase rate for the reserve to 100,000 barrels a day only if Congress found a way to pay for it.    &quot;That makes no sense,&quot; says oil-state lawmaker Bennett Johnston (D., La.), chairman of the Senate Energy Committee. Even the administration says such reserves are crucial to enable the U.S. to comfortably ride out small oil-supply disruptions like those of the 1970s.    Talk of gasoline taxes and alternative oil leasing systems was blocked by Reaganite aversion to taxes and regulation. Import fees were doomed by the administration's projection that they would be extremely costly without producing much more oil.    Harvard professor William Hogan argues that the benefits of a $10-a-barrel fee actually would exceed its costs. But the Energy Department doesn't buy Mr. Hogan's view. Neither does Robert Fri, president of Resources for the Future and a former head of the Energy Research and Development Administration, who says, &quot;Energy is a long-term problem, and quick fixes will do more harm than good.&quot;    But even Mr. Fri says that &quot;the administration should have a more comprehensive program,&quot; mainly in research and development on cheaper oil production and ways to use substitute fuels, such as methanol, to fuel automobiles.    Curbing oil imports hasn't been a priority, complains the oil industry's Mr. DiBona. &quot;In this country, we tend to deal with the immediate crisis, not the long-term problem,&quot; he says, faulting administration officials for inattention to energy amid the distractions of Iran-Contra hearings and other issues.    Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.) charges that Mr. Reagan has a &quot;do-nothing approach&quot; to preparing for &quot;the next energy crisis.&quot; Others contrast the inaction on oil imports with Mr. Reagan's quickness to defend Persian Gulf shipping. Irwin Steltzer, the director of the Energy and Environment Center at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, says, &quot;I think our (energy) policy is called aircraft carriers.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
