The company currently is concentratingon the Eastern Bloc countries, Europe and Latin America forvarious telecommunications opportunities.   Recently, Ameritech competed for a cellular franchise inWest Germany and a Mexican system, although unsuccessfully.&quot;We competed very aggressively for the German cellular systemand we came within a hair's breadth. We will continue tocompete as various opportunities come up,&quot; Mr. Weiss said,adding that Ameritech's cash flow is in a very &quot;goodposition.&quot;   At the end of last year, Ameritech had $520.2 million incash and temporary cash investments. Total assets were $2.8billion and cash flow totaled $3.1 billion.   Ameritech's cellular and telephone units are &quot;very active&quot;in looking for opportunites in international markets. BruceDeMaeyer, president of Ameritech Mobile Communications Inc.,said the unit is discussing the possibility of cellular inNew Zealand and Australia.   On the domestic front, Ameritech is launching aggressiveplans to build rings of fiber-optic cable in majormetropolitan areas in its five-state territory.   Robert L. Barnett, president of the Ameritech Bell Group,said the company initially plans to invest $100 million tobuild the rings in Chicago, Cleveland, Milwaukee,Indianapolis, Detroit, Grand Rapids, Mich., and Columbus,Ohio. To date, Ameritech has installed more than 230,000miles of fiber.   &quot;Fiber rings should be set within the next 12 months,&quot;said Mr. Barnett, conceding that &quot;part of our plan to buildthese fiber rings is in response to competition.&quot;   Ameritech and other regional telephone companies have beenlosing important chunks of corporate business to fiber-opticupstart companies, which are building optical-fiber networksin almost every major U.S. urban hub.   Mr. Barnett said the company's telephone business isgrowing overall at a healthy rate. He said television andradio campaigns marketing additional phone lines are believedto have resulted in increased customer-line growth. Phonelines had been growing in the 2% range, but last yearincreased 2.9%.   He expects the marketing campaign and other factors toincrease phone lines at least 2.9% this year. At the end of1989, the company had 15.8 million customer lines.   Minutes of access use are expected to increase at least5%. Minutes of use last year totaled 43.6 billion. Tollmessages, which numbered 1.4 billion, should grow between 6%and 10%.   Telephone operations also should begin to benefit from newregulatory programs and cost-cutting measures. Illinois andMichigan have adopted &quot;incentive&quot; regulatory plans thatshould give the company greater earnings flexibility.Wisconsin, Ohio and Indiana are looking at similararrangements.   In addition, the company is paring its telephone workforce and consolidating operations. At the end of 1989, about850 manager positions were eliminated in Michigan. Thecompany this year has cut 1,300 slots in Illinois andMichigan and will be slashing an additional 700 positionswhen it consolidates 14 data centers, which house mainframecomputers, to four regional branches.   &quot;We expect to see some substantial savings in laborcosts,&quot; Mr. Barnett said.   Separately, revenue from non-telephone operations isexpected to grow about 10% to 15% over the next few years.Last year, non-telephone revenue was $1.1 billion, or 10% oftotal revenue.   Cellular operations, one of the largest contributors inthe group, continue to grow at a robust pace. New cellularcustomers, which numbered 242,000 in 1989, are expected toincrease 50% this year. In addition, William P. Vititoe,president of the Ameritech Enterprise Group, said Ameritechis shopping for acquisitions to bolster the cellular divisionin the five-state territory.   Ameritech's Tigon unit, which provides voice-messagingservices to corporations, is experiencing 40% growth in newcustomers and now is looking into opportunities in theresidential and small-business markets.</TEXT></DOC>
