The state news agency Tanjug, carrying a statement byMontenegro's state presidency, said the ``urgent measures are beingapplied because of a sudden deterioration of the political andsecurity situation and the possibility that it will spread.''   Today, thousands of workers and students in the republic'scapital of Titograd and two other Montenegrin towns continued tostage rallies and a protest fast. Twelve people were reportedarrested.   The statement carried by Tanjug said the unspecified ``urgentmeasures ... will be of a restrictive nature, aimed only againstthose who are abusing the rightful demands of workers and othercitizens.''   The language indicated police patrols would be stepped up andfirm action taken against provocative public protests. But itsuggested authorities would stop short of using restrictions suchas curfews, at least for the time being.   On Sunday, President Raif Dizdarevic's warned that emergencymeasures would be imposed if ethnic and economic unrest inYugoslavia did not cease.   A national economic crisis, fueled by 217 percent inflation, a$21 billion dollar debt and 15 percent unemployment, has combinedwith tensions between Serbs and ethnic Albanians to fuel threemonths of protests and calls for an overhaul in the party hierarchy.   In Kosovo, one of two autonomous provinces in the southernrepublic of Serbia, the largest of Yugoslavia's six republics,Serbs have rallied against the ethnic Albanian Communist leaders.The mainly Christian Serb demonstrators want more control over themainly Moslem ethnic Albanian majority in Kosovo.   The statement carried by Tanjug today specifically attacked whatit branded nationalist and anti-Communist demands voiced during aTitograd rally that was broken up by club-wielding riot policeearly on Saturday.   This morning, in the north Montenegrin town of Niksic, severalhundred high school and university students rallied in front of agovernment building, Tanjug said. Several thousand striking steelworkers rallied at factory management offices.   The news agency said that 12 people were arrested during anovernight rally in Niksic and face charges for disturbing the peace.   The continuing protests defied a warning made by Dizdarevic in ahastily scheduled speech on national television Sunday night.   Dizdarevic, who heads the nine-member collective statepresidency which acts as supreme commander of the armed forces,appealed Sunday for calm, promised changes in the communistleadership, and urged the government to undertake effectiveeconomic measures.   In his speech, Dizdarevic said recent Serbian nationalistrallies and worker protests ``are seriously jeopardizing publicorder.''   ``There is a real danger that the actions which are imperilingconstitutional order could continue and spread,'' he said.Dizdarevic promised unspecified measures to combat Yugoslavia'seconomic problems.   He also said the policy-making Central Committee, which isscheduled to meet Oct. 17, will make changes in the country'sleadership. But he did not say who might be replaced.   In troubled Kosovo province on Sunday, 20,000 people rallied topress Serbian claims of harassment by the ethnic Albanian majority.No violence was reported at the rally in Titovo Mitrovica, 145miles south of Belgrade.   Albanian Halit Trnavci told the crowd that Serbs and Albaniansshould protect links forged through the centuries.   Serbs have been pushing for greater control over Kosovo andVojvodina provinces and have embraced the drive of Serbian leader,Slobodan Milosevic, who wants to increase his republic's powerthere.</TEXT></DOC>
