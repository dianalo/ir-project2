The three mills at Trois-Rivieres, Grand-Mere and Shawinigan produce about 625,000 metric tons of newsprint a year, or about two-thirds of the company's total output.    A spokeswoman for Consolidated-Bathurst declined to comment on the strike because contract talks are continuing. She said that according to a statement from union negotiators, the strike was caused by a dispute over local issues. Union officials couldn't be reached for comment.    The Canadian Paperworkers Union earlier this month ratified a new three-year contract at Toronto-based Abitibi-Price Inc., the world's largest newsprint producer, that provides a 9.3% wage increase. The Abitibi settlement usually sets the pattern for industry bargaining. Contracts covering 30,000 paper workers at 20 paper companies in eastern Canada expired April 30. </TEXT></DOC>
