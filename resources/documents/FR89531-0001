Schneider, Human ResourcesDivision, APHIS, USDA, Room 213, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road,Hyattsville, MD 20782, (301) 436-6658.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>The statement of organization, functions and delegations of authority ofthe Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is being revisedto reflect changes made in the internal APHIS organization. This reorganizationcreates a headquarters organization based on function, rather than programdiscipline.The statement of organization, functions, and delegations of authoritywas approved by APHIS and USDA management after a lengthy and completereview of all APHIS activities and consultation with affected individualsand groups, both within and outside the organization. It represents thebest balance of needed changes within the headquarters operation with provenmethods of accomplishment within the agency.The major changes and reasons for them are:<ITAG tagnum="84">(1) Redefine the Roles of the Animal Damage Control (ADC), Plant Protectionand Quarantine (PPQ), and Veterinary Services (V) Units</ITAG>As a result of the reorganization, these units are now responsible principallyfor field delivery of domestic agricultural protection programs. Reportinglines have been streamlined, since all Regional Directors are now reportingdirectly to their Deputy Administrator. With separate APHIS units for supportin planning, program design, recruitment, training, and certain other functions,the domestic agricultural protection programs now have a greater base oftechnical support.<ITAG tagnum="84">(2) Establish a Policy and Program Development Unit</ITAG>This unit will establish and manage or coordinate agency-wide planning,policy development, program design, and evaluation systems that until thereorganization have been fragmented or nonexistent. It will enable APHISto place greater emphasis on planning, especially strategic planning, long-rangeplanning, and emergency program planning, and should provide for orderlyidentification, analysis, and resolution of policy issues. Since regulationsdevelopment is an expression of policy, that function is also includedin this unit.<ITAG tagnum="84">(3) Establish a Biotechnology, Biologics, and Environmental ProtectionUnit</ITAG>Creation of this unit demonstrates recognition of the evolving importanceof and need for visibility for activities related to regulation of theproducts of biotechnology. The unit brings together current staff who coordinateregulatory activities and those who conduct operational activities, suchas issuing permits for movement and release of organisms and licensingof veterinary biologics. Consolidating preparation of environmental documentsin this unit provides for greater consistency and efficiency in preparationof these documents.<ITAG tagnum="84">(4) Establish a Regulatory Enforcement and Animal Care Unit</ITAG>The reorganization consolidates these activities into one line organization.This provides for greater consistency and efficiency in violation caseprocessing, underscores the agency's commitment to animal welfare and horseprotection, facilitates development of specialized expertise in animalcare, and provides for more direct involvement of the Administrator inthe management of both regulatory enforcement and animal care activities.<ITAG tagnum="84">(5) Establish an International Services Unit</ITAG>This unit brings together the international program activities now locatedthroughout the agency. It will place greater emphasis on management ofhighly complex and sensitive international activities and provide for greaterconsistency in management and delivery of these programs and an increasedopportunity for cross-utilization of resources.<ITAG tagnum="84">(6) Establish a Science and Technology Unit</ITAG>The reorganization consolidates into one unit agency activities involvinglaboratory support, methods development, and research. The unit bringstogether the National Veterinary Services Laboratories from VS, the DenverWildlife Research Center from ADC, the National Monitoring and ResidueAnalysis Laboratory and the Methods Development Centers from PPQ. Thisconsolidation allows more sharing of laboratory resources, improves theagency's ability to recruit and retain top scientific talent, and helpsAPHIS move toward its goal of establishing the laboratories as centersof excellence.<ITAG tagnum="84">(7) Redesignate the Administrative Management Unit as the Managementand Budget Unit</ITAG>This redesignation makes the title of the unit consistent with the titleof the Deputy Administrator responsible for the unit and better reflectsthe actual functions of this organization. Other changes within this unitinclude elevating Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) and Civil Rights activities,including EEO counseling, by moving them from the Human Resources Divisionand establishing them as separate units reporting directly to the DeputyAdministrator for Management and Budget. This organizational placementis consistent with that of other agencies in the Department and underscoresthe agency's commitment to EEO action.<ITAG tagnum="84">(8) Establish a Recruitment and Development Unit</ITAG>This unit consolidates all agency technical and administrative traininginto one unit, providing greater consistency and efficiency in trainingdesign and delivery. It strengthens the agency's scientific and technicalbase by placing greater emphasis on recruiting, training, and continuingcareer development activities.It is anticipated that these changes will stimulate interdependence andcooperation throughout the agency, enhance the ability of the Administratorto manage the agency, and provide improved support to the field organizationthrough better planning, clearer direction, timely action, and better useof resources.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 and the Regulator Flexibility Act</ITAG>This rule relates to internal agency management. Therefore, pursuant to5 U.S.C. 553, notice of proposed rulemaking and opportunity to commentare not required, and this rule may be made effective less than 30 daysafter publication in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4> Further, since this rule relates to internalagency management, it is exempt from the provisions of Executive Order12291. Finally, this action is not a rule as defined by Pub. L. 96-354,the Regulatory Flexibility Act, and thus is exempt from the provisionsof that Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>This rule contains no information collection or recordkeeping requirementsunder the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>).<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12372 </ITAG>This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistanceunder 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmentalconsultation with state and local officials.
