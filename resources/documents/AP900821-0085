SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CAIRO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The United States will upgrade the Saudi militaryarsenal of U.S. F-15 fighter jets and heavy tanks, a seniorPentagon official said Tuesday as Defense Secretary Dick Cheneyconcluded a whirlwind Mideast trip.   The official, who spoke on condition on anonymity, said nospecific agreements were reached during Cheney's visit with SaudiKing Fahd and Defense Minister Prince Sultan.   But the Iraqi threat to the oil-rich desert kingdom, and theneed to upgrade the Saudi arsenal in the face of Iraqi PresidentSaddam Hussein's million-man army, means the Bush administrationwill consider selling the Saudis high-powered F-15C and F-15D jetfighters as well as heavy tanks, the official said.   The official refused to confirm a report that the vastly moresophisticated version of the fighter, the F-15E, was also on theSaudi's ``wish list,'' but he also declined to rule out such a sale.   Such weaponry would have to be bought from the Pentagon'spresent stock to quickly bolster the Saudi arsenal.   Cheney, heading back to Washington at the end of a four-day tourof five Persian Gulf states, told reporters traveling with him thatthe Bush administration also favors increasing aid to Egypt.   Noting its ``very close relations'' with the United States,Cheney commended Egypt's active role in the Middle East and said``President Bush and our government feel very strongly'' aboutincreased military aid.   Egypt receives about $1.3 billion a year in such aid.   Cheney spoke after a 90-minute meeting with Youssef SabryAbu-Taleb, Egypt's defense minister. He said he and Abu-Taleb``compared notes'' on the crisis created by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasionand subsequent annexation of Kuwait.   ``We hope that diplomatic efforts through the United Nations andeconomic sanctions will ultimately force Saddam to have to giveup,'' Cheney said.   Earlier, Cheney told reporters ``the Saudis are facing a verylarge tank army just across the border in Kuwait.''   ``We have worked with the Saudis in the past ... and basicallywhat we're doing on a short-term basis is reinforcing theircapabilities in these areas,'' Cheney said.   He refused to confirm the exact kind of tanks that are underdiscussion, but noted that the Saudis have ``some substantial airassets'' from the United States, such as the F-15Cs and the F-15Ds.   The Saudis earlier agreed to buy $3 billion worth of thePentagon's most lethal tanks, the M1-A2, but they are not due fordelivery until the mid-1990s. In the interim, possible candidatesfor purchase could be the M1-A1 version or the M-60 tank.   The senior Pentagon official, speaking of the F-15s and heavytanks, said the United States ``will move quickly to consider suchrequests.'' Bush already has waived a congressional limit toprovide 12 more F-15s to the Saudis during the crisis.   Cheney termed his swing through the Persian Gulf a successfulone in that it had increased cooperation with Arab states withwhich the United States had rather cool relations in the past.   Cheney met with King Fahd in the Saudi capital of Jiddah beforeflying to Cairo. Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams described themeeting as ``a good, positive discussion.''   Cheney arrived in Jiddah late Monday after a 15-hour swingthrough five Persian Gulf nations to seek support for the U.S.-ledmilitary operation against Iraq's occupation of Kuwait. He also metwith the princes and sheiks who rule Bahrain, the United ArabEmirates, Oman and Qatar.   On Monday, Sheik Zayed al Nahyan, president of the United ArabEmirates, welcomed the presence in his nation of a squadron ofC-130 transport planes and its company of 575 American militarypersonnel.   The gesture was an important show of cooperation from a gulfnation that had never publicly acknowledged any major U.S. militarypresence on its soil.</TEXT></DOC>
