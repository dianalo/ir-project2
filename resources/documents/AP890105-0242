The dollar has risen overseas in the wake of reports Wednesdaythat U.S. planes shot down two Libyan reconnaissance aircraft overthe Mediterranean Sea.   The U.S. dollar is considered a safe investment in times ofinternational tension and subsequent dollar-buying leads to a risein its value against other currencies.
