Hawkins_Robert T. Stafford Elementary and SecondarySchool Improvement Amendments of 1988, Pub. L. 100-297. Section 3501 ofthat statute comprehensively amends Part E of the General Education ProvisionsAct (GEPA), which relates to the enforcement of legal requirements undermost grant programs administered by the Secretary of Education. On December2, 1988, the Secretary published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM)for this part in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(53 FR 48866). The proposed regulations in thatdocument contained standards and procedures relating to the newly-authorizedOffice of Administrative Law Judges (OALJ) and hearings for the recoveryof funds conducted by the OALJ. These proposed regulations thus implementedthe core provisions of the amended statute. A significant number of technical, procedural, and clarifying changes inthe proposed regulations have been adopted in response to public comment.In addition, the proposed regulations have been reorganized into two subpartsrather than four for easier use. Subpart A contains general provisionsrelating to the OALJ and any proceeding conducted by the OALJ, includingproceedings designated by the Secretary to be conducted by that office.Subpart B contains the specific rules that apply to OALJ hearings for therecovery of funds under applicable programs. The regulations have beenrenumbered accordingly. The regulations in Part 81 do not apply to enforcementproceedings for programs that are not applicable programs under Part Eof GEPA or to other proceedings outside the jurisdiction of the OALJ evenif an Administrative Law Judge from the OALJ is used to conduct those proceedings.<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Comments and Changes </ITAG>In response to the Secretary's invitation to comment, twelve parties submittedcomments on the proposed regulations. An analysis of the comments and ofthe changes in the regulations since publication of the NPRM is publishedas an appendix to these final regulations. Substantive issues are discussed under the section to which they pertain.Technical and other minor changes_and suggested changes the Secretary isnot legally authorized to make under the applicable statutory authority_aregenerally not addressed. <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 </ITAG>These regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order12291. They are not classified as major because they do not meet the criteriafor major regulations established in the order. <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 </ITAG>These regulations have been examined under the Paperwork Reduction Actof 1980 and have been found to contain no information collection requirements.<ITAG tagnum="84">Assessment of Educational Impact </ITAG>In the notice of proposed rulemaking the Secretary requested comments onwhether the proposed regulations would require transmission of informationthat is being gathered by or is available from any other agency or authorityof the United States. Based on the response to the proposed rules and on its own review, theDepartment has determined that the regulations in this document do notrequire transmission of information that is being gathered by or is availablefrom any other agency or authority of the United States. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 34 CFR Part 81 </ITAG>Enforcement, General Education Provisions Act. <ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: April 12, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Lauro F.

Result: The LEA must return fivepercent of the project costs. The LEA provided authorized services fora project in which the 76 target students had to constitute at least 80percent of the total.

A project that included 60 target children wouldmeet the requirement that 80 percent of the children served be gifted andtalented if it included no more than 15 other children. Thus, while theLEA provided authorized services, only 75 percent of the beneficiarieswere authorized to participate in the project (60 target children and 15others).

No waiverof the requirement is authorized. In fiscal year 1986 the LEA spent $100,000from non-Federal sources for program purposes; in fiscal year 1987, only$87,000. Result: The LEA must return 1/30 of its fiscal year 1988 grant_theamount of its grant that equals the proportion of its shortfall ($3,000)to the required level of expenditures ($90,000).

Result: All the funds used to providethe required counseling to the eighth-grade students must be returned.The Federal funds did not increase the total amount of spending for programpurposes because the counseling would have been provided with non-Federalfunds if the Federal funds were not available.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(11) <T3>Matching requirement.</T3> A State receives an allotment of $90,000for fiscal year 1988 under a Federal adult education program. It expendsits full allotment and $8,000 from its own resources for adult education.Under the Federal statute, the Federal share of expenditures for the State'sprogram is 90 percent. Result: The State must return the unmatched Federalfunds, or $18,000. Expenditure of a $90,000 Federal allotment required$10,000 in matching State expenditures, $2,000 more than the State's actualexpenditures. At a ratio of one State dollar for every nine Federal dollars,$18,000 in Federal funds were unmatched.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(12) <T3>Application requirements.</T3> In order to receive funds under a Federalprogram that supports a wide range of activities designed to improve thequality of elementary and secondary education, an LEA submits an applicationto its State educational agency (SEA) for a subgrant to carry out school-levelbasic skills development programs. The LEA submits its application afterconducting an assessment of the needs of its students in consultation withparents, teachers, community leaders, and interested members of the generalpublic. The Federal program statute requires the application and consultationprocesses. The SEA reviews the LEA's application, determines that the proposedprograms are sound and the application is in compliance with Federal law,and approves the application. After the LEA receives the subgrant, it unilaterallydecides to use 20 percent of the funds for gifted and talented elementaryschool students_an authorized activity under the Federal statute. However,the LEA does not consult with interested parties and does not amend itsapplication. Result: 20 percent of the LEA's subgrant must be returned.The LEA had no legal authority to use Federal funds for programs or activitiesother than those described in its approved application, and its actionswith respect to 20 percent of the subgrant not only impaired the integrityof the application process, but caused significant harm to other Federalinterests associated with the program as follows: the required planningprocess was circumvented because the LEA did not consult with the specifiedlocal interests; program accountability was impaired because neither theSEA nor the various local interests that were to be consulted had an opportunityto review and comment on the merits of the gifted and talented programactivities, and the LEA never had to justify those activities to them;and fiscal accountability was impaired because the SEA and those variouslocal interests were, in effect, misled by the LEA's unamended applicationregarding the expenditure of Federal funds.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(13) <T3>Harmless violation.</T3> Under a Federal program, a grantee is requiredto establish a 15-member advisory council of affected teachers, schooladministrators, parents, and students to assist in program design, monitoring,and evaluation.

The project is carriedout, and no damage to the project attributable to the lack of a third studentmember can be identified.

Twocommenters were under the mistaken impression that auditors are authorizedto make such a decision.<T3>Response:</T3> The term ``disallowance decision'' is retained in theregulations because it accurately describes the kind of decision to whichthe recovery of funds provisions of GEPA apply. The decision is not strictlypreliminary. If review of the decision is not sought within the 30 daysprovided by the statute, it becomes the final decision of the Department,without further action, by operation of law. Neither is such a decisionfinal when made, because it is subject to review by the OALJ. To avoidconfusion concerning the effect of a ``disallowance decision,'' the definitionof the term has been amplified to clarify that it is simply a more precisealternative to the statutory term ``preliminary departmental decision''and that it is subject to review by the OALJ.A disallowance decision is made by the official responsible for administeringthe award in question. The facts considered by the official may come froman audit report, but audit findings are recommendatory in nature and donot constitute disallowance decisions.Section 81.4 Membership and Assignment to Cases.<T3>Comment:</T3> Commenters suggested that this section incorporate therequirements of section 451(b) and (c) of GEPA, relating to the appointmentof Administrative Law Judges (ALJs) to serve in the OALJ.<T3>Response:</T3> No change has been made.

Another commenter objected to andSection;81.5(d)(1), which authorizesan ALJ to disqualify himself or herself from a case and suggested thatthe OALJ rather than the ALJ dispose of a motion to disqualify.<T3>Response:</T3> No change has been made.

Commenterssuggested changes that ranged from giving a party an absolute right tocompel an evidentiary hearing and oral argument to maintaining the standardin the proposed regulations but adding a provision to govern the procedureby which a party may argue that an oral presentation is needed.<T3>Response:</T3> Several changes have been made in the regulation. Anew paragraph (c) has been added to require that the ALJ confer with theparties in person or by conference telephone call on the need for an evidentiaryhearing or oral argument if a party requests such a conference. Paragraph(b) has been amended to permit different approaches in the future for proceedingsother than those addressed in this document. The term ``evidentiary hearing''is used in paragraph (b)(1) to be consistent with other sections of theregulations. Finally, the standards in paragraph (b)(2) for determiningwhether an oral argument is needed have been amended to maximize the ALJ'sdiscretion.In the hearings for recovery of funds addressed in this document, it isthe responsibility of the ALJ to regulate the course of the proceedings``to ensure a fair, expeditious, and economical resolution of the casein accordance with applicable law.'' Section 81.5(a). In the Secretary'sview, neither law nor reason requires that the resources of the ALJ andthe parties be consumed by oral presentations that are not needed to resolveissues in the case. The Secretary relies upon the full-time, professionaljudges who conduct the hearings to determine, in the exercise of theirgood judgment and discretion, whether an evidentiary hearing or an oralargument is necessary in the circumstances of the particular case.Section 81.7 Non-party Participation<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that the regulation specify theperiod of time a non-party has to apply to participate in a case. Two commentersoffered suggestions for more detailed standards to govern whether a non-partymay participate. One commenter suggested the regulations provide for non-partyparticipation only to the extent of the parties' participation.<T3>Response:</T3> This section has been retitled ``non-party participation''to clarify the status of the participants. Paragraph (d) has been amendedto permit non-party participation in oral presentations only to the extentthat those presentations are available to the parties. A new paragraph(e) has been added to require that non-party participants comply with therequirements for parties stated in andSection;81.11, concerning motions,and andSection;81.12 concerning filing requirements.The Secretary does not consider it necessary to include in the standardsfor participation the level of detail suggested by the comments. The ALJto whom a case is assigned is afforded wide latitude in considering requestsfrom non-parties to participate in the case. Clearly, an applicant thatfiles a request to participate early in the course of the proceedings islikely to be more easily accommodated than one that files late. Similarly,an applicant that has a direct financial interest in the outcome of thecase has a stronger basis for participation than most. However, the circumstancesof the particular case, viewed in the context of the ALJ's responsibilitiesunder andSection;81.5, are the best guide for determinations in this area.Section 81.9 Location of Proceedings <T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters objected to the justification requiredunder the proposed regulation to hold proceedings outside the Washington,DC. metropolitan area. <T3>Response: </T3>The regulation has been amended to incorporate a standardtaken from the APA under which the ALJ's decision on the location of proceedingsturns on the convenience and necessity of the parties and their representatives.Section 81.12 Filing Requirements <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter objected to the requirement that a partyfile material and serve a copy of the material on the other party ``simultaneously.''<T3>Response: </T3>The regulation has been amended to provide for serviceof the filed material on the other party on the filing date. Conformingchanges have also been made in other sections of the regulations that requireservice of filed material on the other party. In addition, a new paragraph(c) has been added to require that filings be accompanied by a statementcertifying the date of filing and service on the other party. Section 81.13 Mediation <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that this section of the regulationsincorporate the standards governing the measure of recovery in hearingsfor recovery of funds. Another suggested the parties themselves, in additionto the ALJ, be permitted to select the mediator. A third expressed strongsupport for mediation and other alternative means of dispute resolutionand suggested several provisions to encourage the use of the mediationprocess, including automatic notice of the availability of mediation, ALJauthority to compel a party's attendance at mediation, authority of theparties to vary procedural rules, and confidentiality of communicationsmade during mediation. <T3>Response: </T3>The regulation has been amended to clarify that theOffice of Administrative Law Judges, not the ALJ himself or herself, arrangesfor a mediator if the parties to a case agree to mediation. The Secretaryconsiders the selection of an independent mediator acceptable to both partiesto be a responsibility of the Department. Changes in the regulation areunnecessary to accommodate some of the commenters' suggestions. The standardson measure of recovery must be applied in a notice of a disallowance decisionand at every subsequent stage of the proceedings, including any settlementreached as a result of mediation. Recipients of disallowance decisionsare automatically notified of their right to request voluntary mediationunder andSection; 81.24(c)(2). Provisions on the confidentiality of communicationsmade during mediation are found in andSection; 81.13(e). Other suggestedchanges were either unnecessary under the regulation as written or inconsistentwith the voluntary nature of mediation under section 451(h) of GEPA. Section 81.15 Evidence <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested deleting the requirement thatevidence accepted by the ALJ be material. Two others objected to the exclusionof ``unduly repetitious'' evidence. <T3>Response: </T3>No change has been made. The exclusion of irrelevant,immaterial, and unduly repetitious evidence is contemplated by 5 U.S.C.556(d). The application of these standards is properly reserved to thesound discretion of the ALJ. Section 81.16 Discovery <T3>Comment: </T3>Three commenters suggested that the regulation requirethe Department to make available for examination and copying by the recipientthe audit work papers that relate to a disallowance decision. Another commentersuggested adding procedures for the ALJ's review of privileged materialand authorizing the ALJ to impose sanctions for failure to comply withan order to disclose that material. <T3>Response: </T3>The regulation has been amended to clarify the statutoryauthority of an ALJ to compel a party to produce relevant documents. Adoptingthe approach of Rule 34 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the regulationprovides that an ALJ may order a party to make those documents availablefor inspection and copying by the party making the request. Pursuant tothe policy in favor of voluntary disclosure of relevant documents and informationstated in paragraph (a) of the regulation, the Department currently makesaudit work papers in its possession available for recipients to examineand copy. Procedures for the review of privileged material are, under these regulations,reserved to the ALJ's discretion. If a party fails to comply with an ALJ'ssubpoena requiring the production of documents, section 451(g) of GEPAauthorizes the ALJ to apply to the appropriate court of the United Statesfor its enforcement.Section 81.17 Privileges <T3>Comment: </T3>Three commenters suggested deleting this regulation onthe grounds that it duplicates a provision in the preceding section orthat it is unnecessary. Another commenter suggested adding provisions onhow a legal privilege may be asserted. <T3>Response: </T3>No change has been made. The Secretary believes thatthe regulation as written serves a useful purpose in describing how thelaw on privileges should be interpreted. The regulation adopts the approachof Rule 501 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. Section 81.22 Proportionality <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that provisions relating to therecovery of funds in proportion to harm caused to a Federal interest bedeleted from the regulations, since they restate the statute. Another suggestedthat the regulation restrict consideration of the proportionality issueto the ALJ alone. Several commenters suggested that the hypothetical examplesof how the standards for proportionality apply be deleted from the testof the regulations; some suggested including the examples in nonregulatoryguidance. Some commenters objected to certain examples, generally on thegrounds that the hypothetical fact patterns inaccurately described actualcases or that the amount of the recovery was too high. <T3>Response: </T3>No change has been made in paragraph (a) of the regulation,which states the standards for proportionality. These standards governan important part of the Department's enforcement procedures, and theirretention in this section promotes a better understanding of the referencesto proportionality elsewhere in the regulations. The suggested limitation on who may consider the proportionality issuehas not been adopted. The statute contemplates that the standards for proportionalityare an element of the administrative enforcement process from the recommendationthat funds be recovered through the Secretary's review of an ALJ's initialdecision. The auditor who recommends that funds be recovered, the programofficial who reviews that recommendation, the parties to any mediationor settlement negotiations, the ALJ who reviews a disallowance decision,and the Secretary in his review of the ALJ's initial decision must takethe standards for proportionality into account in performing their functions.Moreover, limiting consideration of proportionality to ALJs would be contraryto reason. Program officials would be unable to apply porportionality indetermining the amount of disallowances, and recipients would be forcedto appeal the resulting decisions to bring the concept into play. The precedentsdeveloped by ALJs in these cases would be virtually useless because programofficials would not be able to apply them.The examples that illustrate how the standards for proportionality applyhave been removed from paragraph (b) of the regulation and placed in anappendix to the regulations. These examples represent the Secretary's interpretationof the statutory provisions on proportionality in hypothetical cases. Theirpurpose is to promote predictable, consistent, and equitable results inthe enforcement of grant conditions. To the extent that the hypotheticalcases illustrate principles that apply to actual misexpenditures of funds,the Department will apply those principles. Some of the examples have beenamended in response to comments recieved, as follows:andbullet; <T3>Example andplusmin;5. </T3>Several commenters suggested that the examplein the proposed regulations was inconsistent with the holding in <T3>California </T3>v. <T3>Bennett</T3>, 849 F.2d 1227 (9th Cir. 1988), a case involving the allowabilityof certain field trips under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary EducationAct. The example did not address whether field trips are an authorizedactivity under Title I or any other Federal program, but was intended toillustrate only the appropriate measure of recovery if eligible beneficiariesreceive unauthorized services. To clarify the illustration, the unauthorizedactivities in the example have been changed to the provision of healthservices that are available to all children in the LEA.andbullet; <T3>Example andplusmin;9. </T3>Two commenters stated that the recovery ofthe entire grant in the circumstances described in the last sentence ofthis example was excessive. That sentence has been amended to clarify thatthe hypothetical statute in question is unambiguous and inflexible in itsterms. In such a case, the remedy for a seemingly excessive recovery offunds lies in the legislative process.andbullet; <T3>Example andplusmin;10. </T3>Some commenters criticized this example ongrounds relating to the nature of current drug education programs. Theexample was intended to illustrate not the application of a particularprogram requirement, but rather the appropriate measure of recovery wherea requirement had been violated. The example has been amended to clarifythis point.andbullet; <T3>Example andplusmin;12. </T3>Some commenters criticized the results inthis example and in Example andplusmin;13 of the proposed regulations astoo harsh. As a result, Example andplusmin;12 has been amplified to illustratemore clearly how the recipient's violations of planning and applicationrequirements harmed important and indentifiable Federal interests associatedwith the program under which the grant was received, as provided in andSection;81.22(a). The other example in the proposed regulations relating to applicationrequirements has been deleted as unnecessary to illustrate the principlein question.Section 81.23 Mitigating Circumstances<T3>Comment</T3>: Several commenters offered observations and suggestionson the provisions of this regulation. Two commenters suggested that paragraph(a) expressly address a case in which all the identified misexpenditures,not just some, were attributable to mitigating circumstances. Some objectedto, or expressed confusion about, the provisions of paragraphs (b) (1)and (2), concerning erroneous written guidance for the Department, and(c) (1) and (2), concerning guidance requested but not received.<T3>Response: </T3>No change in paragraph (a) is needed to ensure thatany amount of a misexpenditure attributable to mitigating circumstancesis not required to be returned to the Department; this proposition is addressedin andSection; 81.21(b). However, the regulation has been amended in otherrespects. The procedures in paragraph (b), concerning requests for authoritativeguidance, have been simplified. Paragraph (b) implements section 453(b)(2)(A)of GEPA, read in light of the legislative history of that provision. Underthe statute, a recipient may place reasonable reliance upon ``erroneouswritten guidance provided by the Department.'' GEPA, andSection; 453(b)(2)(A).The Conference Committee report explains this provision as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">``Written guidance'' is intended to mean written guidance issued atthe Office of Director level o[r] above, addressing, a specific requestfrom a local or State educational agency regarding a policy, interpretation,or question pursuant to a Federal law, implementing regulations, or non-bindingguidance issued by the Secretary. It is not intended to encompass telephoneconversations, informal discussions at conferences, informational handoutsprovided at meetings with Department of Education staff, or written communicationbelow the Office of Director level, unless such communication meets therequirements of section 453(b)(2)(B).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">S. REP. NO. 100-222, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 392 (1987).</ITAG>The quoted legislative history is reflected in paragraph (b) (1) and (2)of the regulation. As amended, this paragraph requires that, to prove mitigatingcircumstances, the recipient prove, in part, that the erroneous guidanceit relied on was provided in response to a specific written request submittedto the Department at the address provided by notice published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. The notice referred to in this provision appearselsewhere in this issue of the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. While recipients need not send requests to thedesignated address prior to the effective date of these regulations, theyare invited to do so to ensure that their requests received appropriateattention. Recipients are encouraged to identify the programs to whichtheir requests pertain by Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance numbersor other specific information.The procedures in paragraph (c) for submitting formal guidance requestsunder section 453 (b)(2)(B) and (b)(5) of GEPA have been simplified alongsimilar lines. In response to comment, the requirement that a formal guidancerequest be submitted by certified mail, return receipt requested, has beendeleted.Section 81.24 Notice of a Disallowance Decision<T3>Comment: </T3>Commenters offered various suggestions intended to ensurethat a recipient of a notice of a disallowance decision is fairly apprisedof the legal and factual basis of the decision. The thrust of the suggestionswas that the regulation should specify the contents of the notice in greaterdetail to facilitate the recipient's response.<T3>Response: </T3>The regulation has been amended in several respects.Paragraph (b)(1) incorporates one commenter's suggestion to require thata notice of a disallowance decision ``state'' a prima facie case. Paragraph(b)(2) has been amended to provide that, if the notice relies on factsin another document_such as an audit report or a monitoring report_thedocument must be identified in the notice and available to the recipient.Paragraph (b)(3) has been amended to set out the elements of a prima faciecase where a recipient failed to maintain records or failed to allow accessto records.Section 81.27 Application for Review of a Disallowance Decision<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested challenges in the regulationto allow changes to the sufficiency of a notice of a disallowance decisionand to permit amendments to applications for review if new issues are laterraised. Another commenter suggested that the regulation require that recipientsbe permitted the opportunity to amend any inadequate application.<T3>Response: </T3>The language of the regulation as written permits arecipient to challenge the sufficiency of a prima facie case for the recoveryof funds, and the regulation has therefore not been changed to provideexpressly for such a challenge. If the ALJ to whom the case is assignedsustains a challenge to a prima facie case, the notice of a disallowancedecision is returned to the official who issued it. Section 81.28(b)(1).If that official then modifies and reissues the notice, the recipient'sability to raise issues relating to the merits of the modification is fullypreserved. The modified notice is, in effect, a new notice of a disallowancedecision, and the recipient may file a new application for review raisingany issues it chooses.Paragraph (d) of the regulation has been amended to clarify the circumstancesin which the ALJ may permit a recipient to supplement or amend its applicationwith respect to issues that were timely raised. So long as the applicationsubstantially complies with the requirements in paragraph (c) for the contentsof an application, the ALJ may permit such supplements or amendments asa fair, expeditious, and economical resolution of the case requires. TheSecretary believes this approach is consistent with basic fairness andpermissible under section 452(b)(1) of GEPA, which requires that an applicationfor review be submitted not later than 30 days after the recipient's receiptof a notice of a disallowance decision.In addition to the amendments described above, the regulation has beenamended to require that an application for review contain a statement certifyingthe date the recipient received the notice of a disallowance decision andto require the Departmental official who made the decision to provide theALJ with supporting documents identified in the notice as soon as the applicationfor review is filed.Section 81.28 Consideration of an Application for Review<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested limiting an authorized Departmentalofficial to two opportunities to state a prima facie case for the recoveryof funds. Two commenters offered suggestions relating to the opportunityof a recipient to correct deficiencies in an application for review.<T3>Response: </T3>No change has been made. A Departmental official's opportunityto state a claim for the recovery of misspent or unaccounted-for fundsis limited by the statute of limitations at section 452(k) of GEPA, which,under these regulations, runs until a prima facie case is stated. However,the period for issuing disallowance decisions to ensure that grant fundsare spent in accordance with the law is not otherwise limited by the statute.A recipient's opportunity to supplement or amend an application for reviewis addressed in the response under andSection; 81.27 above.Section 81.29 Submission of Evidence<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that paragraph (a) be amendedto clarify that the 90-day period for the submission of evidence runs fromthe OALJ's receipt of an ``acceptable'' application for review.<T3>Response: </T3>The suggestion has been adopted in amended regulatorylanguage.Section 81.30 Burden of Proof<T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters suggested that a recipient's obligationto account for funds, as stated in paragraph (a) of the proposed regulation,be rephrased by deleting the word ``fully.'' One commenter objected tothe phraseology of paragraphs (b) and (d) of the proposed regulation asplacing an unfair burden on recipients.<T3>Response: </T3>The reference to a recipient's obligation to accountproperly for funds has been revised to follow the language of section 452(a)(1)of GEPA. In addition, the regulation has been reorganized to enumerateseparately each of the elements as to which a recipient, in a particularcase, has the burden of proof in the review of a disallowance decision.Section 81.32 Petition for Review of an Initial Decision<T3>Comment: </T3>Commenters objected to certain provisions of the proposedregulation relating to the time and manner of filing a petition for reviewand serving a copy of the petition on the other party. One commenter askedfor a clarification of the reference to reasons for affirming an initialdecision, contained in paragraph (d)(2) of the regulation.<T3>Response: </T3>The provisions on filing and service have been amendedin two respects. A party may use ``overnight or express mail,'' and itmust serve filed materials on the other party ``on the filing date.''The reference in paragraph (d)(2) to a statement of reasons for affirmingan initial decision has been retained. The regulations are structured topermit a party to submit a petition for review and affirmance of an initialdecision. The statute allows a petition for review to be filed as lateas 30 days after receipt of the initial decision, and it provides thatthe initial decision becomes final 30 days later unless the Secretary hasruled otherwise. Without the opportunity to file a petition in supportof the initial decision, the party that favored affirmance would be requiredto wait for the other party to file its petition for review in oppositionto the decision. To permit the best possible advocacy within the statutorytimeframe, a provision for a peitition in support of the initial decisionhas therefore been adopted.<ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-10874 Filed 5-4-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4000-01-M </ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
