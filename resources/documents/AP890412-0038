CARLSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Sue Kocol's first try at videotaping turned outto be once-in-a-lifetime event.   Peering through the viewfinder of a borrowed camera, sherecorded the dramatic crash of a helicopter that was removingequipment from the top of her 25-story condominium building.   ``It was a peculiar thing,'' Mrs. Kocol said. ``I do recall thatas long as you're behind the camera, you think maybe it's not real... maybe it (the helicopter) will straighten out.''   But the craft that had begun to tilt and spin out of controlfirst sent its load crashing to the ground and then plunged downitself.   It crashed next to the U.S. Coast Guard station at the LakeMichigan shore, but pilot Ben Moore, the only person in thehelicopter, escaped serious injury.   Moore, 43, of Elmhurst, Ill., was treated for cuts to the legsand face at Milwaukee County Medical Center, said hospitalspokeswoman Pam Hansen.   ``We've been very lucky here,'' Mrs. Kocol said. ``At the momentit looked like it was going to be very tragic.''   Mrs. Kocol's videotape and another taken from the roof by thebuilding's maintenance man, Peter Bakke, appeared on local andnetwork newscasts Tuesday evening.   Richard L. Porter, Milwaukee district manager for the FederalAviation Administration, attributed the crash to the failure of acoupling between a transmission drive shaft and the tail rotor. Asa result, he said, the rotor stopped and the helicopter startedspinning clockwise, out of control, finally diving to the bank ofground next to an old submarine slip.   The helicopter was a Sikorsky S-58T owned by Midwest HelicopterAirways Inc. of Hinsdale, Ill.   Mrs. Kocol's son, Stan, is a helicopter pilot with the AirNational Guard in Salina, Kan., but Mrs. Kocol said:   ``I really know nothing about flying and I really know nothingabout cameras.''   She had never used a video camera before but borrowed one fromanother son, David, Monday night to videotape the helicopter atwork.   She and her husband, Raymond, watched from a small park as thehelicopter arrived and began removing air conditioning equipmentfrom the roof.   As the helicopter carried the largest piece, believed to weighabout 2 tons, the rotor snapped, Mrs. Kocol said. On thevideotape's soundtrack, ``you hear kind of a grinding noise alittle bit before he lets go of the piece,'' she said.   Fellow workers said the pilot signaled with his arm to those onthe ground before letting go of the load.   ``Everyone was stunned,'' she said. ``People were crying andvery upset.''   She said the scene was too much for her granddaughter, ChristinaKocol, who witnessed the accident on her second birthday.   The accident left the girl very upset, said Mrs. Kocol, and shetook the child inside.   That's when she determined her camera work had captured theaccident almost in its entirety.</TEXT></DOC>
