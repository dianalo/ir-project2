Poindexter's Iran-Contracase Thursday ordered a hearing on whether the former nationalsecurity adviser may introduce evidence that covert aid toNicaraguan rebels was legal.   U.S. District Judge Harold Greene scheduled a Sept. 6 hearing todiscuss whether there was valid evidence that Poindexter could useto defend the charge that he obstructed congressional inquiries intowhether National Security Council aide Oliver L. North was secretlyhelping arm the Nicaraguan Contras.   Poindexter is accused of obstructing Congress in August 1986 byassuring three House committees in letters that the NationalSecurity Council was observing ``the spirit as well as the letter''of a ban on U.S. military assistance to the anti-Sandinista rebels.   Greene said he wanted to determine if Poindexter should be givena chance to prove he had no motive to conceal North's activities byshowing they were ``legal, authorized, or known throughout thegovernment.''   At issue is whether any knowledge of the activities by PresidentReagan or other government officals could be presented as evidencethat Poindexter thought the National Security Council was followingthe law.   Greene said he would also hear arguments on whether the existenceof other covert operations by the Reagan administration could alsobe cited as evidence that Poindexter thought North's activities insupport of the Contras did not violate the congressional ban.   No date has been set for the trial of Poindexter, who is alsoaccused of lying and helping devise a false chronology of U.S.-Iranarms sales in November 1986 when Congress began its investigation ofthe Iran-Contra affair.</TEXT></DOC>
