Browning (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> EUROP </CO><IN> ERN AUT </IN><DATELINE> PARIS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   In one of the sharpest turnarounds in European manufacturing history, Regie Nationale des Usines Renault swung to record profit last year, ending six years of disastrous losses.    The French state-owned auto maker posted consolidated profit of 3.69 billion francs ($642.9 million) for 1987, in contrast to a deficit of 5.54 billion francs in 1986. Sales rose 9.3%, to 147.51 billion francs ($25.70 billion).    But Renault's chairman, Raymond Levy, acknowledged the company still has a long way to go before it catches up to competitors such as Peugeot S.A. and Fiat S.p.A. In a continuing effort to boost efficiency, he said, Renault and its subsidiaries will eliminate 6,000 more jobs this year. In the four previous years, 30,000 jobs have been eliminated.    The return to profit &quot;marks a clear recovery,&quot; said Mr. Levy, &quot;but it is insufficient. We know our competitors will have an even more favorable result.&quot;    Renault officials noted that the exceptional strength of their 1987 recovery was due in large part to record auto demand in Europe. Mr. Levy said arch-rival Peugeot is likely to announce 1987 profits twice as high as that of Renault.    Nevertheless, Renault's good news was greeted with euphoria both inside and outside the company. The austere evening newspaper Le Monde made Renault's return to profit its lead front-page story, headlining with the words &quot;Spectacular Recovery.&quot;    For Renault, it marks the culmination of a three-year restructuring effort in which the company has eliminated jobs, boosted quality control and shed subsidiaries and affiliates such as American Motors Corp. Mr. Levy announced with some relish that Renault's balance sheet &quot;has now been cleaned up,&quot; and is free of ailing assets that could provoke &quot;sudden, large unexpected losses.&quot;    Renault's return to profit marks a triumph both for Mr. Levy and for his late predecessor, Georges Besse. Mr. Besse began the restructuring efforts when he was named Renault chairman early in 1985. After Mr. Besse's 1986 assassination by leftwing French terrorists, Mr. Levy succeeded him and continued the program.    Most striking about the 1987 result is that it follows six years during which Renault racked up 32.5 billion francs of losses. Many doubted the concern ever would emerge from the red. The losses leave Renault with crushing financing and restructuring costs. But the earlier losses exempted Renault from taxes, and under a special arrangement with the French government, Renault received a small tax reimbursement last year.    Renault sold more vehicles in 1987 than in any year since 1983. Most important, Renault officials said, strong overall demand kept prices and profit margins high, which accounted for most of the profit surge.    Renault officials said that they hope to boost profit further this year, but that it would be impossible to improve it as sharply as last year. Sales so far remain strong, but Mr. Levy said the outlook for the second half is uncertain. </TEXT></DOC>
