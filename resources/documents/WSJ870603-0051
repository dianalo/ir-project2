In Russian, the Communist practice of paying the lazy and the industrious the same wages is called uravnilovka, and Sasha doesn't disguise his contempt when he spits out the word.    &quot;Many people strive in vain,&quot; he says. &quot;People should be paid according to their work.&quot;    Tanya, a 35-year-old single mother, isn't so sure. She spends her days cutting and weighing meat in a canning plant and is grateful for the one freedom Soviet society appears to provide in abundance: the freedom to loaf.    &quot;I don't want to work like an American,&quot; she says. &quot;The Soviet Union is a good place because if you don't want to work hard you don't have to.&quot;    The views expressed by Sasha and Tanya reflect a debate that is taking place within the Communist leadership on a proposed overhaul of the centralized wage system that was decreed by Josef Stalin in 1931.    Party boss Mikhail Gorbachev and his supporters are calling for the introduction of more incentives to spur workers to produce more and revive the nation's stagnating economy, which according to one Western estimate grew at a post-World War II low of 1.5% last year.    Current practices threaten to &quot;bankrupt our economy,&quot; says an economist at a leading Moscow research institute.    Already, Mr. Gorbachev has instituted quality controls at industrial enterprises. Since Jan. 1, a newly created agency has been sending inspectors to factories with the authority to declare goods too shoddy for sale to the public. Managers at the plants must make up any resulting losses by slashing bonuses.    Now, the Soviet leader intends to strengthen the link between pay and performance by making wages -- and not just bonuses -- subject to penalties. Later this month, he will introduce a draft law on business enterprises to a plenary session of the Communist Party Central Committee, which includes 300 of the nation's top officials. It will contain a provision obliging managers of financially troubled factories to cut both wages and bonuses to make up for losses.    Mr. Gorbachev's supporters don't want to stop there. Some prominent economists favor the abolition of wage ceilings to allow workers to earn as much as they can. Others recommend decentralizing decision-making and letting factory managers award pay as they see fit.    The proposed legislation is aimed at improving the efficiency of businesses and ending their reliance on massive state subsidies. But tampering with workers' pay is a revolutionary step in the Soviet Union, and Mr. Gorbachev's opponents on the Central Committee are expected to try to water down the wages provision before the measure goes to the Supreme Soviet, the country's rubber-stamp parliament, for approval on June 29. The debate thus will be a test of Mr. Gorbachev's political strength.    &quot;It remains to be seen whether the wage provision can win Central Committee support,&quot; says one Western official.    Though the official press uniformly applauds Mr. Gorbachev's initiative, his proposals have triggered stiff resistance both from bureaucrats and from industrial workers, who make up three-fourths of the labor force of 136 million people. A recent poll conducted by the U.S.S.R. Institute of Sociological Research, for example, showed that 40% of workers in engineering and metal-working factories in Kazakhstan, the country's second-biggest republic, oppose any change in policy.    Gennady Batygin, deputy director of the official journal Sociological Research, says critics couch their opposition in ideological terminology. For example, he writes, some officials claim that widening wage differentials would &quot;weaken collectivism and the striving for selfless labor and for the good of the homeland, tear apart the moral-political unity of the Soviet people, and create a social basis for the restoration of petty-bourgeois attitudes.&quot;    But Mr. Batygin concludes such arguments fail to take into account human fraility: Without the prospect of rewards, he says, workers tend to do as little as possible. &quot;Many officials obviously prefer workers to be poor, equal, and obedient,&quot; he says.    Mr. Gorbachev himself is seeking the ideological high ground by citing Lenin's famous dictum: From each according to his abilities, to each according to his labor. Thus, Mr. Gorbachev says, the &quot;main thing is to use socialist principles, and correctly evaluate each person's contribution -- the quality and quantity of his work.&quot;    The Soviet leader's opponents have a powerful motivation: self-preservation. &quot;If the principle of pay according to work is implemented, it can be used as a pretext for firing thousands of worthless bureaucrats,&quot; says one Soviet intellectual. &quot;Of course they're against it.&quot;    Currently, industrial wages are determined by the State Committee for Labor and Social Questions. The top rate is set at about three times the lowest. Workers move up the scale, now consisting of 50 ranks, primarily according to time spent on the job, not performance.    Ruslan Khasbulatov, a senior official at Moscow's prestigious National Economy Institute, blames this policy for &quot;the development of the entire range of negative trends in our economy.&quot;    &quot;It is one of the main obstacles to increasing labor productivity,&quot; he writes in Pravda, the Communist Party daily. </TEXT></DOC>
