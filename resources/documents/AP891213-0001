The conclusions were drawn from a two-year review of data fromstate and federal environmental agencies, as well as fromlaboratory analyses conducted during a voyage down the Mississippiby the Greenpeace ship Beluga in 1988.   Pollution was found from St. Paul, Minn., to the mouth of theriver. It was found in increasing amounts as the expeditioncontinued downstream, the report said.   The most severely elevated death rates occur downstream fromareas of the greatest toxic discharges, including St. Louis,Memphis and all riverside parishes in Louisiana, the report said.   The report noted that some downstream communities, including NewOrleans, draw drinking water from the river.   Average mortality rates in lower Mississippi River counties andparishes, from Cairo Ill., to the Gulf of Mexico, are 14 percenthigher than the rest of the nation, researchers said.   The river carries 213 million pounds of toxic chemicals per yearas it passes New Orleans, the report said. Beginning at the river'smouth, the Gulf of Mexico contains a 2.4 million acre dead zonewhich cannot support aquatic life.   The report blamed pollution for decreasing fish and wildlifepopulations all along the river.   River pollution comes from chemical manufacture, the use andmanufacture of pesticides, pulp and paper mills, sewage treatmentplants and hazardous waste disposal facilities, Thornton said.   ``It's not a pretty report and the picture that it paints is nota pretty picture,'' said Costner. ``What we're seeing is evidencethat it's time to change.''   Greenpeace warned that without immediate action to reducepollution in the river, as well as along its banks and in the air,the entire river region can expect more cancer and other problems.   The Louisiana Chemical Association also released a reportTuesday showing that between 1987 and 1988, its member industrieshad reduced by 9.1 percent, or 89 million pounds, the chemicalwastes they are required to report to the U.S. EnvironmentalProtection Agency. Its members disposed of 924 million pounds ofchemical wastes in 1988, the report said.   LCA spokesman Richard Kleiner said the report does not includeall wastes, only those required to be reported under federalSuperfund regulations. He said the amount of wastes not reportedunder those regulations could not be determined.   Chemical industry officials dispute the correlation betweencancer rates and chemical releases, saying the statistics used byGreenpeace have not been adjusted for other factors, such aspoverty, race, urban locations and smoking and drinking.</TEXT></DOC>
