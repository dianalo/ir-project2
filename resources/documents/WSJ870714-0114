Speculation about a lower rate has grown because of recent declines in some bank borrowing costs amid mounting evidence that the Federal Reserve System has eased credit slightly. Also, business loan demand has been far from robust.    But don't hold your breath, many bankers and economists say. Several bankers argue that their borrowing costs haven't fallen enough to justify a lower prime rate. They also argue that it's unclear whether the Fed has eased credit and thus that recent rate declines could prove short-lived.    This sense of cautiousness about lowering rates contrasts sharply with bankers' behavior early this spring. At that time, bankers were quick to seize on only slight increases in their borrowing costs as a justification for raising their prime rates, then 7 1/2%, to 7 3/4%.    &quot;It's the same old story,&quot; says Richard B. Hoey, chief economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. &quot;Banks are a little slower to move on the down side than on the up side.&quot; Bankers, he said, find it &quot;easy to be skeptical about the recent drop in rates because lowering the prime rate would squeeze their profit margins.&quot;    Banks also may be especially reluctant to lower their prime rates because of concern about their loans to Latin American countries saddled with heavy debts. Major banks have added billions of dollars to their loan-loss reserves in recognition of the shakiness of many such loans.    Bankers insist that such accusations are unfair. &quot;Bank moves on the prime rate this year have somewhat lagged the market,&quot; a Citibank official said. &quot;To say that banks are quick to raise the rate is not quite fair.&quot; He declined to comment on recent rumors that Citibank was about to lower its prime rate, or base rate on corporate loans.    Walter Wriston, the former chief executive of Citibank, points out that bankers aren't alone when it comes to slowness in passing along reductions in their costs.    &quot;When the price of paper went through the floor, I noticed The Wall Street Journal never cut its prices,&quot; Mr. Wriston said. &quot;I couldn't understand it,&quot; he added with a smile. &quot;Here the price of paper went so low that you couldn't even give trees away. I kept going to the newsstands waiting for the Journal to cut its prices. They never did it.&quot;    Lawrence Armour, director of corporate relations at Dow Jones andamp; Co., publisher of the Journal, laughed at Mr. Wriston's remarks, then said Mr. Wriston &quot;was obviously being facetious.&quot; He said Mr. Wriston &quot;clearly is aware that while newsprint is an important element in the cost structure of a newspaper, it is only one of many that go into determining the total cost.&quot;    Rumors of a prime rate cut have been spreading mainly because of recent declines in the closely watched interest rate on federal funds, which are reserves that banks lend each other overnight. When Chase Manhattan Bank initiated the last prime rate boost in mid-May, the funds rate was hovering around 6 3/4%. Lately, it has been hovering around 6 5/8%. Last Friday, it averaged 6.54%.    Federal Reserve officials, as usual, won't comment on speculation that the Fed has eased credit. But a clearer signal of the Fed's plans is likely to emerge soon. The Fed's policy-making committee met last week to review its credit strategy and money supply targets. A Fed official is expected to appear at a congressional hearing next week to discuss the central bank's money targets and economic projections.    Henry Kaufman, chief economist of Salomon Brothers Inc., said in a recent report that the Federal Reserve has adopted an easier credit stance. But others disagree.    &quot;I don't believe the Fed has in any way eased&quot; credit, Francis Schott, chief economist of Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S., said. He said Fed policy appears to be &quot;standing pat&quot; and that rumors of a prime-rate cut are likely to prove incorrect.    The prime rate is used by banks as a base rate on loans to many small and medium-sized businesses. It also is used as a base rate on a growing number of consumer loans such as home-equity loans.    Although the prime rate is important to many smaller businesses, the nation's largest companies aren't affected by it. Banks are willing to offer them significantly lower rates to try to discourage them from turning to other sources of credit, such as overseas markets or commercial paper. But smaller companies and consumers usually don't have such options and must pay rates tied to the prime.    Mr. Wriston and other bankers say it is a mistake to focus solely on the federal funds rate in gauging banks' cost of funds. &quot;I am inclined to look at a basket of rates,&quot; including Eurodollar rates, he said.    Mr. Wriston also said banks face growing competition not only from the commercial paper market but also from foreign banks.    &quot;The Japanese come in here and, same as with semiconductors, they dump their money,&quot; he said. &quot;I sit on some boards where they in fact have done that. I'm not crying about it. It's just a very different marketplace than you used to have when the only place U.S. Steel could go for money was a bank.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
