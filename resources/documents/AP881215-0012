The General Accounting Office says the government should spend$112 billion to close failed institutions and abandon its currentstrategy of trying to keep the institutions alive through assistedmergers.   GAO said the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., or FSLIC,will need $85 billion over and above the $27 billion it expects tocollect in fees from Sandamp;Ls through 1998.   However, the congressional auditing and investigative agencywarned that the pricetag will be even higher if interest rates rise.Most economists expect rates to climb through the middle of nextyear, but offer no firm predictions beyond that.   The investigative agency, in a draft of a report to the HouseBanking Committee, sharply criticized the Federal Home Loan BankBoard, regulator of the nation's 3,000 Sandamp;Ls, for attempting torescue failed Sandamp;Ls by providing money to private merger partners.   The report noted that the insurance fund spends on mergers about90 percent of what it would cost to simply close insolventinstitutions and pay off depositors. However, mergers do not alwaysresolve the problem and, counting tax losses to the government, maywell be more costly, it said.   ``Regulators and Congress have resisted massive closings ofinsolvent savings and loans in the hope that the fortunes of theseinstitutions would reverse themselves,'' it said. ``This hope hasproven both futile and costly.''   It noted that industry losses totaled $9.4 billion in the firstnine months of this year.   The GAO said failed Sandamp;Ls should be placed into receivership inthe next year and most of the $112 billion should be spent in thenext three years.   The bank board has avoided that approach, arguing that massiveclosings could leave some areas of the nation without service froman Sandamp;L and that a flood of repossessed real estate from failedinstitutions could deepen the regional recession in the Southwest.   Breaking down the $112 billion, the GAO said $77 billion will berequired to close insolvent _ but still open _ Sandamp;Ls, which numbered434 at the end of September. Previously, GAO and the bank board hadestimated that closing insolvent Sandamp;Ls would require about $50billion.   The new report also cites additional expenses, including $10billion needed to finance borrowing by the FSLIC, which guaranteesSandamp;L deposits up to $100,000, and $5 billion likely to be requiredfor losses that have occurred but haven't been discovered yet. Anadditional $20 billion should be set aside as a reserve againstfuture losses, GAO said.   The thrift industry can contribute $5 billion to $10 billion, butthe rest ``may have to come from the federal government unlessothers, such as (commercial) banks and depositors, are required toshare the cost,'' the GAO said.   The report did not specifically recommend a taxpayer bailout,saying only that ``Congress must make difficult choices.'' However,it warned that continuing an extra fee charged Sandamp;Ls for depositinsurance, over and above what competing commercial banks pay,``could weaken healthy thrifts and thereby prove self-defeating.''   Separately, the Treasury Department is working on its ownrecommendation to the incoming Bush administration and Congress.Reagan administration sources have said the Treasury is consideringa plan to borrow the money through a newly created agency, keepingmost of the spending out of the federal budget deficit.   The GAO recommended ``at this time'' against merging FSLIC withthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which backs deposits incommercial banks.   ``GAO strongly advises against further weakening the depositinsurance system through a merger in which FDIC's reserves andpremium income, both of which are needed for bank problems, aresimply diverted to cover some of FSLIC's losses,'' it said.   However, the report said healthy Sandamp;Ls that want to changethemselves to commercial banks and join the FDIC should be allowedprovided they pay the appropriate fees to the FSLIC.   The GAO is circulating its draft report for comments and hopes toissue the final version in January or February.   Charles J. Koch, chairman of the National Council of SavingsInstitutions, an industry trade group, called the GAOrecommendations ``provocative'' and ``refreshing.'' His grouprepresents many savings institutions which are already members ofthe FDIC and others which would be healthy enough to transfer.</TEXT></DOC>
