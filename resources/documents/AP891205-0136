SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The United States does not plan to protest thedetention of U.S. military observers by Soviet officers in EastGermany last week, an incident the Pentagon revealed Tuesday tohave been the fifth of its kind in the past year.   Five Soviet military observer teams were detained by Westernmilitary forces in West Germany over the same period, said Pentagonspokesman Pete Williams.   Asked whether the detentions amounted to tit-for-tat events,Williams said, ``I am only reporting the facts.''   In announcing that the Pentagon had no plans to protest thelatest incident, Williams said, ``No one senses that they wereunreasonably detained.''   A U.S. officer and non-commissioned officer were held for 7{hours near Halle, about 80 miles southwest of Berlin, and a tire ontheir car slashed with a bayonet.   The detention took place Friday on the eve of President Bush'ssummit with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, but it was notmade public until reporters made inquiries in Washington on Monday.   Williams, adding fresh details during a briefing Tuesday, saidthe U.S. soldiers were stopped in their car by a man dressed incivilian clothes who informed them that they were in a restrictedzone.   ``The tour tried to leave, but was blocked. Another individualin civilian clothing punctured the vehicle's left front tire with abayonet,'' Williams said. ``Then a Soviet investigation officerarrived and indicated to the U.S. tour officer that that was anoverreaction, the puncturing of the tire.''   The spokesman said U.S. Army officials in Europe found theSoviet officer who came to investigate ``cordial, professional andthorough,'' and that the two American soldiers were found not tohave been in a restricted area.   ``No U.S. personnel were threatened. They did not perceive athreat to their safety,'' Williams said.   The spokesman said no one was injured and the U.S. soldiersreturned to their base in the East Germany city of Potsdam nearBerlin.   Williams said it appeared that the man who had slashed the tirewas a Soviet officer.   He said the Americans were detained for such a long time becausethe Soviet investigating officer had to come some distance and thenconducted a very thorough investigation.   The observers are part of the U.S. military mission that wasestablished under a 1947 accord that allows the Western allies andthe Soviets to set up offices in each other's occupation zones.Under this pact, the United States, Britain and France havemilitary liaison offices in East Germany, which is the old Sovietoccupation zone, and the Soviets have three in West Germany, one ineach of the old U.S, British and French zones. Each office may havea staff of 14 soldiers.   Asked what the two U.S. officers were doing at the time of theincident Friday, Williams said, ``They were doing what U.S.military liaison mission people do. They go out and they lookaround. It's similar to what the Soviet military mission does,based out of Frankfurt.''   The detention came despite the signing in June of a U.S.-Sovietagreement designed to avoid dangerous military incidents reachedbetween then-chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. WilliamCrowe, and top Soviet military officials.   On Monday, the Pentagon also announced that U.S. and Sovietofficials met in Washington in August and in Moscow in November toprepare for implementation of the safety accord. The agreement isscheduled formally to come into force Jan. 1.   In March 1985, a Soviet sentry shot an unarmed U.S. Army major,Arthur D. Nicholson Jr., and let him to die without medical aid,saying Nicholson had been ``caught red-handed'' taking pictures ina restricted area of East Germany.</TEXT></DOC>
