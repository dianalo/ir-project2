Define VAXen?andO;For help, turn to dictionary editors, who have begun tracking newcomputer terms and hackers slang. (Media) (column)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Ross, Randy.andM;</AUTHOR><SUMMARY>Computer terms have crept into the English language, giving newmeaning to words such as mouse, virus and menu.andP;  Other terms, likekludge, frobnicate and VAXen have not yet made the officialdictionaries.andP;  These words remain proprietary to conclaves ofcomputer enthusiasts.andP;  Kludge is a makeshift device to deal withhardware or software problems.andP;  Frobnicate means to manipulate ortweak something, just for the fun of it.andP;  Vaxen is a term -similar to ox and oxen - the plural of (Digital Equipment Corp)VAX minicomputers.andP;  These and other terms are slowly entering theglossaries of computer professionals.andP;  However, there is noindication that they will ultimately be admitted to officialEnglish language dictionaries.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     GlossaryTerminologyDefinitionsJargonUser Behavior.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Computer World WatchandM;It's your first networking conference.andP;  You're nervous.andP;  You tighten yourtie, tape an unabridged dictionary to your calf, and limp over to theSheraton.andM;In one corner of the ballroom, several people, dressed in cords andcrepesoled shoes and clutching Styrofoam coffee cups, are talking andgesticulating wildly.andP;  Ah, hackers.andM;&quot;You shoulda been there.andP;  People were really flaming.&quot;andM;&quot;What was the deal?&quot;andM;&quot;These VAXen--a LAN with several VAXen.andP;  But I kludged it yesterday.andP;  Itshould last the week.&quot;andM;Huh?andP;  You summon a weak smile, shuffle over to the corner, and pull out thedictionary.andP;  You can't find a useful definition for flaming, there's nothingabout VAXen, and you can't conjugate to kludge.andP;  You feel like a preschoolerattending an astrophysics conference.andM;Don't despair.andP;  You'll fare better at future events as dictionaries begin toinclude more computer terms--both words coined to describe new technologicaldevelopments and slang words used in new ways.andM;Professional word watchers--lexicographers, editors, and authors--arebeginning to identify and track computer-related words such as flaming,VAXen, and kludge.andP;  But before a computer word makes it into a layman'sreference book like The American Heritage Dictionary or Webster's New WorldDictionary, dictionary editors must cite it a number of times in the generalpress.andP;  Typically, a new computer word appears in the trade press first, thenfinds its way into a mass-market science publication such as ScientificAmerican or the Science section of The New York Times.andP;  But it's not untilthe word penetrates the general news section of a newspaper or appears inmainstream magazines such as Time and Newsweek that dictionary editorsconsider granting it space in their new editions.andM;As they track computer-related words, those editors and other word watchersare discovering that computer words and jargon are formed differently fromother words.andP;  Many computer terms are based on English, unlike the Greek- orLatin-based words used in other scientific disciplines, says VictoriaNeufeldt, editor-in-chief of Webster's New World Dictionary.andM;New computer words are often simply standard words used in a new context orwith a different meaning.andP;  Menu, mouse, and virus already appear in thedictionary, but not generally in their computer contexts.andP;  It's likely thatthe next editions of standard dictionaries will also include the new uses ofthese everyday computer words.andM;Finding the MeaningandM;But what about those puzzling words you encountered?andP;  What do they mean?andM;Flame (verb) has two meanings that refer to a loss of control at thekeyboard.andP;  The first definition is &quot;to argue or complain vigorously withanother by using a computer.&quot;andP;  Typically, individuals flame by leaving angrymessages on computer bulletin boards or in an adversary's electronic mailbox.andP;  The second definition is &quot;to communicate via computer rapidly andobsessively on subjects both significant and trivial.&quot;andP;  Most e-mail usersknow some flamers.andM;Neufeldt has been tracking flame and has cited it in mainstream publications,including Time, Fortune, and The New York Times, as far back as 1983.andP;  Flamealso appears in The Hacker's Dictionary, an informal glossary available sincethe late 1970s at many university computing centers (and published inpaperback by Harper andamp; Row in 1983).andP;  It is kept up to date in a file on diskby various contributors, with assistance from the MIT and Stanford AIcommunities and Worcester Polytechnic Institute.andP;  You can use the word withprepositions (flame on, flame off) or as a gerund (flaming), referring to theactual complaint or the banter.andM;Kludge or Kluge (pronounced &quot;klooj&quot;), used as a noun or a verb, appears inThe Hacker's Dictionary and in the third edition of Webster's New WorldDictionary of Computer Terms.andP;  The word, which has also been cited in Moneymagazine, is being watched by lexicographers at Houghton Mifflin, publishersof The American Heritage Dictionary.andM;A kludge is a makeshift or jury-rigged method or device for dealing with asoftware or hardware problem.andP;  Though kludges solve problems temporarily,they can be negative, like solutions that work for the wrong reasons or areunnecessarily complex, such as Rube Goldberg-type devices.andP;  A two-story,turbocharged gadget that holds floppy disks is a Rube Goldberg kludge.andM;The verb form refers to solving a problem by using a kludge: &quot;But I kludgedit yesterday.&quot;andM;David Jost, senior lexicographer at Houghton Mifflin, says that the word maydate back to World War II, originally referring to makeshift engineeringsolutions.andP;  The word was probably spoken before anyone tried to write it;hence the two possible spellings.andM;VAXen is a plural noun for more than one DEC VAX computer.andP;  Ox is to oxen asVAX is to VAXen.andP;  The word, which is most popular among college students,appears in The Hacker's Dictionary, too.andM;VAXen has longevity working for it but DEC working against it.andP;  &quot;I have heardit before, but it is not in common use; our premise is that VAX is anadjective, not a noun,&quot; explains DEC spokesman Mark Fredrickson.andP;  He says theproper plural for VAX is VAX coputers or VAX computer systems.andM;Keeping WatchandM;Other computer-related words that the pros are tracking include informate andcolor cycling.andM;Jost's people at Houghton Mifflin are watching for occurrences of informate,a verb whose definition is still fuzzy.andP;  According to a recent article in TheAtlantic, informate means &quot;to extract useful information from the successfulperformance of tasks.&quot;andM;In looser terms, informating refers to the act of getting additional feedbackby employing information technology.andP;  For example, computerizing a paperfiling system allows everyone access to client files once available only tothe executive secretary.andP;  The widespread availability of information makesmore people in the company aware of what's going on and increases learning.andO;In a sense, information technology not only manages information, it makesinformation more available; it informates, or helps disperse information.andM;Shoshana Zuboff, a specialist in social psychology and the history of work atHarvard Business School, coined the word, which has appeared three times inThe New York Times, Jost says.andM;Color cycling is a computer graphics feature that can produce inexpensiveanimation.andP;  Originally developed for use on mainframes, the video feature canadd animation effects to home movies and sales presentations.andP;  DeluxePaint,from Electronic Arts, incorporates color cycling and recently released aversion for the PC.andM;The term color cycling probably originated about ten years ago at the XeroxPalo Alto Research Center (PARC) in California, according to Dan Silva,author of DeluxePaint.andP;  Color cycling enables you to select a set of colorsand make them alternate on command.andP;  If you select yellow and red, forexample, and then hit the color cycle command, the yellow parts of yourscreen will turn red and the red parts yellow.andP;  The colors will continue toalternate until you stop the color cycling.andM;As VGA monitors continue to drop in price and graphics programs become morepopular, graphics terms like color cycling will become more common, says RussWalter of Somerville, Massachusetts, publisher and author of The Secret Guideto Computers.andM;How's Your Vocabulary?andM;Test your friends on their knowledge of the following computer-related termsand slang expressions:andM;Frobnicate (verb), sometimes abbreviated as frob, means &quot;to manipulate,adjust, or tweak, just for the fun of it.&quot;andP;  If someone is turning a knobcarefully, he's adjusting it.andP;  If he's turning it for the hell of it, he'sfrobbing it.andM;A phone hawk (noun) is an individual who gains access to a computer systemvia modem and copies or destroys data.andM;A sabermetrician (noun) is a statistician who uses computers to measure theabilities of individual baseball players and teams and to preduct theirfuture performance.andM;A stylogram (noun) is a computer graphic in the form of a pie chart thatreflects certain parts of speech used by public figures.andP;  It may divulgeinformation about their underlying interests.andP;  The pie chart is divided intosix sectors corresponding to various parts of speech, including adjectives,nouns, verbs, adverbs, prepositions, and pronouns.andM;You're no doubt hearing and using new words in your work with computers.andO;We're interested in hearing about them.andP;  So go ahead, informate us.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
