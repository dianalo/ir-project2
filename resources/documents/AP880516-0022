VERNACI</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   As Michael Dukakis tightens his grip on theDemocratic presidential nomination, party leaders are movingincreasingly to join his camp. Few, however, are throwing theirsupport these days to Jesse Jackson.   In the weeks since his make-or-break victory in the Wisconsinprimary, the Massachusetts governor has picked up support from 69of the party's ``super delegates,'' while Jackson has gained justsix, according to a survey by The Associated Press.   In all, Dukakis has 1,610 delegates to the Democratic NationalConvention, of whom 203 are super delegates _ the 643 party leadersand politicians whose titles won them seats as delegates. Dukakisis now more than three-quarters of the way to the 2,081 delegatesneeded to win the party's presidential nomination.   ``It follows success with the voters,'' said Tad Devine,director of delegate selection for the Dukakis campaign. ``It allbegan in Wisconsin.''   Jackson has 956 delegates overall, 52 of whom are superdelegates. Another 331 super delegates are uncommitted.   Jackson has complained that super delegates, who are free tosupport whomever they choose, are not following the will of thevoters and that Dukakis is receiving more than his fair share.   But Iowa party chairwoman Bonnie Campbell, who recentlyannounced her support for Dukakis, said Jackson's complaint isunfounded.   ``Reverend Jackson or his people were in on the decision-makingprocess that led to rules governing the entire nominatingprocedure,'' Ms. Campbell said. ``He, in fact, signed off on therules. Therefore he's somewhat foreclosed from complaining.''   Dukakis, who had been stung in Jackson's landslide victory inMichigan on March 26, came back to win the Wisconsin primary 10days later and went on to win the primaries in New York,Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Nebraska and West Virginia.   Although the super delegates are not required to declare theirallegiance to any presidential candidate, some are being drawn tothe Dukakis campaign as if by the force of gravity caused by hisstring of victories and his wide lead in the delegate count.   ``It's a two-person race, and I don't think it's going to beclose,'' said Robert Dryfoos, a New York super delegate whorecently came out in support of Dukakis.   ``There was a time it was a very tight race,'' Dryfoos said.``Now Mike Dukakis is clearly, comfortably and overwhelmingly aheadof Jesse Jackson as they get to the nomination. He's going to bethe nominee.''   The Dukakis campaign has put considerable organization andeffort into courting both the super delegates and those who werepledged to candidates who have quit campaigning.   Sue Pate, an uncommitted delegate from Texas, said she has beenimpressed by the contact she's had with the Dukakis campaign.   ``They've really been doing their homework,'' she said. ``Theycall me every second. They are not abusive. They are friendly andhelpful.''   Winberg Chai, who was picked as a South Dakota delegatesupporting Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt, said he planned tosupport Jackson after Gephardt dropped out.   But the Jackson campaign contacted him only once and did notsend any of the candidate's position papers, Chai said. He hasswitched to Dukakis.   Some delegates have been falling away from Sens. Paul Simon ofIllinois and Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, both of whom put theirpresidential campaigns on hold.   Gore now has 32 super delegates, a decline of 17 in recentweeks, and Simon has 22, a drop of seven. Overall, Gore has 403delegates and Simon has 174, according to the AP delegate count.</TEXT></DOC>
