Charles Rose, D-N.C.,chairman of the House tobacco and peanuts subcommittee.   ``I certainly think it's a bad idea,'' said John F. Banzhaf III,director of Action on Smoking and Health, one of the nation's majoranti-smoking organizations.   ``To be providing $150 million because a crop that kills peopleis damaged, and spending less than 1 percent of that on educatingpeople about the hazards about tobacco is really an example ofhaving priorities upside down,'' Banzhaf said.   Rose said the provision was in no way an effort to bypass ``thenormal economic operation'' of the tobacco program, in which no taxmoney, outside of administrative costs, is supposed to be used forprice supports.   Under 1983 farm legislation, tobacco lawmakers agreed to aprovision requiring growers to finance their price-support systemthemselves, in contrast to other farmers who receive governmentsubsidies. The law, which remains in effect, forbids the use oftaxpayers' money for tobacco price supports except for $15 millionin administrative costs.   This ``no-net-cost'' compromise with anti-smoking forces hasbeen the focus of a series of controversies since then.   Anti-smoking forces contend that a complex 1986 law enabled theAgriculture Department to arrange a $1 billion, taxpayer-financedbailout of the tobacco price-support system without violating theletter of the law.   Rose, an outspoken House champion of tobacco growers, was ableto incorporate language into the drought relief bill that seeks tomake clear that the envisioned disaster payments for growers arenot a violation of the no-net-cost agreement because they are notactually price supports.   In the last major drought that hit American farmers, in 1983,there were no disaster payments for tobacco growers, even thoughthe crop of burley tobacco produced primarily in Kentucky andTennessee was badly damaged by sun and a shortage of rainfall.   But the disaster that befell the 1983 crop was followed by the1986 bailout legislation that anti-smoking forces say violated thespirit if not the letter of the no-net-cost agreement.   An effort last year by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., to allowtobacco exporters to benefit from a $1.5 billion export enhancementsubsidy program, by attaching a special provision to the omnibustrade bill, was defeated after anti-smoking forces complained. Theyalso oppose the current provision.   There is no way to know precisely how much of the $6 billiondrought bill would be devoted to tobacco payments because theextent of damage to the crop is not yet known. But HouseAgriculture Committee staff economist Howard Conley told lawmakersin a note: ``Of $1.6 billion in payments for non-program crops,some $150 million can be imputed to tobacco.''   The drought bill has been moving through Congress at high speed.   The House version of the measure cleared its committee hurdle onWednesday and is floor passage is expected by the end of the week.The Senate is also planning to act on the legislation before theweekend.   Farm lawmakers from both houses said they are aiming to meet ina conference committee next week to fashion the finished productand send it to President Reagan's desk before they go on theirsummer recess Aug. 11.   A number of lawmakers who usually are critics of farm programssaid that they were not familiar enough with the legislation tomake a judgment on its provisions. They indicated they had notheard of the tobacco provision.   Rep. Edward R. Madigan, R-Ill., the ranking Republican on theAgriculture Committee, said that ``when you are doing somethinglike this you cannot discriminate against any crop.''   Asked if he considered it a violation of an agreement, he said:``No.''   But he also noted that under a 1985 law farmers must havepurchased federal crop insurance to be eligible for disasterpayments but that provision has been waived under the drought bill.   ``So that's a violation,'' he said. ``There are a lot ofviolations of agreements and previous understandings that arebrought about by the circumstances. It's an agreement until thecircumstances change.''   Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt.,said he did not want to address the tobacco subsidies issue in themidst of the drought, but vowed to speak out on the question in1990 when the next farm program is drawn up by Congress.   Asked if he considered the topic of tobacco subsidies aparticularly touchy one on the Senate Agriculture Committee, Leahysaid: ``I certainly don't think it should be off limits any morethan any other subject should be off limits.''</TEXT></DOC>
