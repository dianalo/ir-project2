<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-15-0496 </DOCNO><TEXT>10 solar plants were installed on buildings and the measurements monitoredin the context of a program for energy saving by using solar technology.The main aim was to set up an energy balance for these solar plants,in order to show the energy saving of the plant by an energy flow diagram.The degree of use and cover rates made it possible to determine the capacityof the plants and to compare them. There are reports on the measurementtechnique (radiation measurement, heat quantity meters, platinum resistancethermometer, alternating current meter for measuring auxiliary energyof the pumps in the solar circuit) and on a simulation program (mathematicalmodel to determine more powerful solar plants) and on the evaluationof solar plants (degree of use, cover rate). Results are submitted onuseful system components, number of faults, plant control, planning asolar plant and their installation costs. The use of solar energy forheating service water and low temperature heating can only be optimizedwith correct choice of the type of plant, the control concept, usefulmanufacturers equipment and skilled installation.
