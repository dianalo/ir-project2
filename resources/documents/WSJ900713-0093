For Diebold, based in Canton, Ohio, the arrangementprovides access to IBM's world-wide marketing network. DavidRobertson of the Nilson Report, a newsletter in Santa Monica,Calif., said the accord should greatly help Diebold. He saidthat although Diebold leads in the U.S. market for themachines, with a 39% share, it has only about 12% of theworld market, which he said would total close to $3 billionthis year.</LP><TEXT>   The venture could help IBM, Armonk, N.Y., in an area wherethe company has struggled. The Nilson Report said IBM hasjust 9% of the U.S. market and 5% world-wide. The agreementis part of IBM's continuing attempts to re-evaluate whatbusinesses it should be in and to link up with companies withexpertise in certain slices of the computer market.   Although terms of the agreement weren't disclosed, thecompanies did say Diebold will own a majority of the venture.They said the joint venture will handle U.S. marketing of thecombined product line to the larger banks, while IBM willmarket the products overseas. Diebold will provide servicefor the products in the U.S. -- and will buy some assets fromIBM's service operation to facilitate this -- while IBM willhandle service overseas. The two companies will continue tomanufacture their existing products.   Currently, NCR Corp. of Dayton, Ohio, dominates theautomated teller machine market, with what the Nilson Reportsays is a 27% share world-wide.   The joint venture comes at a time when the technology inautomated teller machines is increasingly resembling that ofpersonal computers, and banks are working very hard tointegrate all their computers, from teller machines upthrough their mainframes.   IBM has set up a series of partnerships of various kindsover the past year and a half. Most have been with softwarecompanies. In addition, IBM formed a venture withChicago-based Baxter Healthcare Corp. to sell software andservices to the medical profession.   Diebold, for its part, has been saying for some time thatit wanted to expand internationally. Last year, amid talkthat it was a takeover candidate, Diebold also said it waslooking at alternative means of distribution and at ways toconsolidate manufacturing operations to cut costs.   Although the two companies have nearly 50% of the U.S.market when combined, they said they didn't anticipate anyantitrust objections from U.S. officials. A JusticeDepartment spokesman said the agency's antitrust divisionisn't currently reviewing the IBM-Diebold joint ventureproposal. He added, though, that the department isn't awareof the companies' having formally notified antitrustregulators about their plans.</TEXT></DOC>
