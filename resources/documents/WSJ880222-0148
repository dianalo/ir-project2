The stake would be part of an ambitious project for industrial and financial cooperation between the bank and the industrial group, known as ERT. Spokesmen for both concerns declined comment.    The bank could be expected to build its holding to about 30%, financial sources said. The Kuwait Investment Office, the London-based investment arm of the Kuwaiti government, has acquired a stake of nearly 25% in ERT, making it the group's largest single shareholder. The Kuwaiti agency has demanded half the seats on ERT's board, its vice chairmanship and the post of board secretary, in what is expected to be a prelude to a capital operation to give the agency full control. </TEXT></DOC>
