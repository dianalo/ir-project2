(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Eight years after a Vietnamese manleft his homeland in a crowded fishing boat, he is helping organizea benefit concert for Vietnamese boat people living in a refugeecamp in Thailand.   ``(If) we as Vietnamese people (do) not help, then no one willhelp,'' said Khanh Nguyen, 31, a technician for Honeywell Inc.   Nguyen and seven other Vietnamese put together the concert oftraditional and modern Vietnamese music and dance by performersfrom California, Michigan and Canada. The concert is Saturday inthis Minneapolis suburb.   ``I don't want to devote all my life looking for food and justsurvive,'' said Nguyen. ``I want to help and contribute tosociety.''   ``We have everything, they have nothing,'' said Tu Nguyen,another organizer, who is not related to Khanh Nguyen.   The group hopes to raise $3,000 and give it to the American RedCross to help 4,000 refugees in the Thai border camp of Ban Thad.   The State Department estimates that 300 to 400 Vietnamese havelanded on Thai shores in the past several months. To discourageother refugees, the Thai government is not allowing the Ban Thadresidents to resettle in another country, according to thedepartment.   Thai officials are urging Vietnamese seeking to emigrate fromtheir homeland to join overseas relatives under aU.S.-government-sponsored resettlement plan, rather than coming toThailand.   Tong Nguyen, the group's chairman, called treatment of the BanThad refugees ``an injustice. We know the people who becomerefugees are those ... who risk their lives to be free.''   Tong Nguyen came to the United States a day before South Vietnamfell to the Communists in 1975 and is now a refugee resettlementworker for Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of St. Paul andMinneapolis.   Minnesota has about 8,000 Vietnamese, most of them in the TwinCities, many of them with individual success stories like KhanhNguyen and his wife.   Three days after leaving Vietnam, they landed in Thailand.Attacked by pirates, the refugees had been robbed of their moneyand gold. Nguyen lost the rosary that his mother gave him.   The couple spent several months in a refugee camp and then cameto the United States.   This is the second time local Vietnamese have been involved in abenefit concert for refugees. In 1986, they raised $5,000 to help aWest German rescue mission of Vietnamese boat people, Tong Nguyensaid.</TEXT></DOC>
