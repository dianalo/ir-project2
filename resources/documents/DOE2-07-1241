Atlantoaxial subluxation is an infrequententity in children aged 8-16 years and usually follows mild trauma. Itis often overlooked on plain films and is difficult to diagnose on polytomographs.Magnified thin-section (3-5-mm) axial CT scans of the skull base andproximal cervical spine with soft-tissue and bone window settings werediagnostic, clearly delineating the relationship of occipital condyles,atlas, and axis. CT disclosed all seven cases of atlantoaxial subluxation.In retrospect, subtle plain radiographic and polytomographic abnormalitiesof the craniocervical junction were present in the patients with persistenttorticollis. Follow-up CT scans showed gradual reduction of atlantoaxialsubluxation in five cases detected early and treated with traction. Intwo cases diagnosed 2 weeks after trauma, follow-up CT scans showed onlyslight improvement with conservative traction therapy. These two patientssubsequently required open reduction and fixation.</TEXT></DOC>
