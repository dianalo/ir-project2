Garcia</HL><DD> 09/18/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)STOCK INDEXES (NDX) </IN><TEXT>   Stock prices closed mostly lower after an uneasy trading day.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 2.29 to 2527.90 after moving in a narrow range throughout the session.    Some traders believed many investors focused on the lazy movements of the U.S. dollar, which ended mixed yesterday. Yet, others think a great number of investors stepped to sidelines to avoid any wide price swings possible in anticipation of today's &quot;triple-witching hour,&quot; the simultaneous expiration of stock index futures, index options and options on individual stocks.    The Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index climbed 0.07 to 314.93, while the New York Stock Exchange composite index closed down 0.03 to 176.48.    Although the various market indexes showed gains at several times during the day, declining issues outnumbered gainers throughout the session. The closing tally was 838 issues down and 691 up.    Volume on the Big Board contracted once again, to 150.7 million shares from 195.7 million Wednesday.    Gerald Simmons, a managing director at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., said that although investors seem to be worried about the same &quot;litany of problems&quot; -- the dollar, higher rates and faster inflation -- there has been &quot;a change in psychology.&quot;    He and other traders agree that investors' Pavlovian response of buying stocks on any price drops has been reversed. In the past week or so, they seem to be more interested in taking profits whenever stock prices advance even a little, they said.    Michael Metz, a market strategist with Oppenheimer andamp; Co. in New York, believes investors have few reasons to buy stocks right now. He said investors would like to see whether the industrial average's slide stops around 2500, as it did last week; whether the dollar stabilizes, and whether the bond market finds a floor. Yesterday's late bond rally is no guarantee that the bond market is ready to blast off, Mr. Metz added.    Although investor apprehension remains about today's triple-witching hour, most Wall Streeters are pretty confident it will be a non-event. Some are so confident that they feel no need to be glued to their Quotrons -- the head of one stock futures department is taking the day off.    As in June, some contracts, namely the futures contract on the Sandamp;P 500-stock index, will use opening prices for settlement and some other contracts will use the closing prices as usual. The Big Board will start publishing any order imbalances on 50 big-capitalization stocks at 9 a.m. EDT and again at 3:30 p.m. EDT.    Robert Gordon, president of Twenty-First Securities, a New York-based investment firm, believes it should be an uneventful opening and close because prices in recent days made it worthwhile for many investors and stock-index arbitragers to unwind their positions early.    But if there's action today, Mr. Gordon believes some investors might have to buy stocks to replace the index futures contracts that expire.    Hospital Corp. of America eased 5/8 to 44 3/4 on more than 1.7 million shares. The hospital operator plans to buy back as many as 12 million shares as part of a major restructuring to boost profitability. Hospital Corp. plans to sell 104 hospitals to HealthTrust Inc. to finance the buy-back.    Buy-backs usually boost prices, but John Hindelong at Smith Barney said Hospital Corp. had been planning the sale of those hospitals for a while and it was expected that it would use the proceeds to buy back stock. He believes many investors were waiting to sell on the news.    Brockway jumped 19 1/8 to 58 3/8 on heavy volume. Owens-Illinois, a private company controlled by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, is negotiating to possibly acquire Brockway for $60 a share. News on Brockway sparked interest in Teledyne and several other firms in which Teledyne has a substantial interest. Teledyne, which has a 21% stake in Brockway, rose 11 3/4 to 369 1/2.    Litton Industries, 27.7%-owned by Teledyne, gained 3 1/8 to 101 7/8, and Curtiss Wright, in which Teledyne has a 44.9% stake, advanced 2 3/8 to 67 1/2.    Ford Motor rose 3/4 to 104 3/4. The auto maker and the United Auto Workers have reached a tentative agreement on a new three-year contract. The contract addresses job security, which was a major bargaining factor for the union.    General Motors lost 1/4 to 87 1/4. Now that a tentative contract has been reached at Ford, GM is preparing to intensify its bargaining with the union to reach a contract settlement. Chrysler added 1 to 43 1/4. The Canadian Auto Workers Union accepted a new contract offer from Chrysler's Canadian unit.    Citicorp sank 3/4 to 57 1/2 on more than 5.2 million shares, making it the most-active Big Board issue. It looks as if the weight of Citicorp's new offering depressed the share price yesterday. Late Wednesday, Citicorp offered 20 million shares at 58 1/4.    Home Shopping Network fell 7/8 to 14 1/8 on the American Stock Exchange. The company, which created a stir in the stock market and the retailing world with its televised shopping services a little more than a year ago, announced a major restructuring yesterday. It plans to become &quot;strictly a holding company,&quot; selling consumer products and services.    Federal Express rose 3 3/4 to 69 1/4 in active trading. Although it said that earnings from continuing operations for its fiscal first quarter, ended Aug. 31, fell slightly to $1 a share from $1.03 a year earlier, traders said the results were better than expected.    USAir fell 1/2 to 47 1/4. E.F. Hutton airline analyst Hans Plickert recommended taking profits in Piedmont because he's concerned that USAir's proposed $69-a-share acquisition of the air carrier won't be completed. He told Dow Jones' Professional Investor Report newswire that Piedmont could fall $15 if the proposed merger fails; he also sees a temporary setback for USAir. Piedmont eased 1/8 to 68 5/8.    G. Heileman Brewing added 1 3/8 to 41 7/8 in active trading. The brewing company urged shareholders not to accept a $38-a-share tender offer by Amber Acquisitions, launched Sept. 4, because it considered the offer &quot;inadequate.&quot; Amber is a unit of Australia's second-largest brewer, Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd.    Newmont Mining rose 1 1/2 to 100 5/8 in active trading. Ivanhoe Partners, a group led by T. Boone Pickens Jr., is suing Newmont Mining, charging that the company violated securities laws, including prohibitions against insider trading, to block takeover attempts.    Restaurant Associates Industries rose 3/8 to 18 1/8. A management-led group began a tender offer for all of the company's Class A and Class B shares at $18 each. But after the close Wednesday, Anwar Soliman boosted his offer for the company to $20 a share from $19.    Drug stocks were hit especially hard by profit-taking. Merck fell 4 5/8 to 201 5/8, Squibb dropped 2 3/8 to 97 1/8, and Upjohn declined 1 1/4 to 49.    Pillsbury shares rose as the company reported higher earnings. The stock advanced 1/2 to 43 3/4. </TEXT></DOC>
