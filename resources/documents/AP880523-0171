The Kansas Republican told his colleagues, ``the ball is in ourcourt, the Republicans' court'' as the Democratic-controlledchamber began a second week of work on the Intermediate-rangeNuclear Forces treaty.   Later, Secretary of State George Shultz met with Republicansenators and urged approval of the pact before the summit.   ``Here is a treaty that has been examined in more detail thanany arms control treaty in history, by far,'' Shultz said after theCapitol Hill session. ``There is a time to inquire and there isalso a time to vote. ... It would be a good thing to have it.''   The first decision came when the Senate voted 81-13 to kill anamendment by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C. It would have prevented thetreaty from taking effect until Reagan reassures Congress about theaccuracy of the number of triple-warhead Soviet SS-20 missileswhich will be destroyed.   Later, the chamber killed, on a 68-26 vote, an amendment by Sen.Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo., that would have required a change in thetreaty's text to eliminate what he said was a loophole that wouldhave permitted construction of some Soviet missiles.   Then, the Senate rejected, 81-5, an amendment by Sen. GordonHumphrey, R-N.H., that would have delayed the INF pact until thetwo nations agreed on a more far-reaching pact providing 50 percentcuts in each side's large arsenals of long-range atomic weapons.   Humphrey said, ``We ought to wait until we see the wholepicture'' before approving any pact, but critics termed it a``killer amendment'' designed to derail the treaty.   Before the votes, Dole told his colleagues again the Senateshould approve the pact before Reagan meets Soviet leader MikhailS. Gorbachev in Moscow from May 29 to June 2.   Helms and other conservatives have blocked action by the fullSenate, delaying the ratification that even critics say is assured.Ratification requires a two-thirds majority voting in favor.   ``I'm still convinced it would be an embarrassment to thepresident of the United States to sit down with Mr. Gorbachev laterthis week without the Senate have taken action to consent toratification of the treaty,'' Dole said.   However, he added, ``We have some serious issues that, in somecases, may take several hours or days.''   The treaty, signed Dec. 8 by Reagan and Gorbachev, requiresdestruction within three years of all atomic missiles with rangesbetween 300 miles and 3,400 miles. For the Soviets, that includes400 deployed SS-20s and another 250 stockpiled SS-20s.   The United States has accepted the Soviet statement of 650SS-20s, even though Defense Intelligence Agency analysts say theSoviets may be hiding more than 250 of the weapons.   ``We were snookered,'' Helms said. ``The estimates are that theSoviets have 300 to 600 more than the 650 thy admit to having.''   ``This is a gut issue,'' Helms said. ``It could mean thedifference between survival and destruction for Europe, or a goodpart of it.''   But Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., noted that Reagan administrationofficials have rejected Helms' claim, although Lugar conceded it isdifficult to prove that no SS-20s are hidden.   ``It is akin to proving the Loch Ness monster doesn't exist,''Lugar said.   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., said that even if SS-20s arehidden, they could not be deployed without violating the treaty andtheir ``viability would degrade quickly'' without testing.   Helms' amendment ``is not needed, it is unnecessary and it wouldhamper our efforts to get the INF treaty in place,'' Cranston said.   Wallop's proposal affected a part of the treaty which, he said,was written in such a way as to permit production of Soviet SS-25missiles that would be interchangeable with stages in the SS-20.The SS-25 is not banned.   ``This amendment just is to make certain that we do what we setout to do,'' Wallop said, explaining that he wanted to make surethat no SS-25s were produced that would be interchangeable with theSS-20.   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Senate ForeignRelations Committee, agreed with Wallop that the treaty's language``is awkwardly written.''   But Pell said the amendment wasn't needed because if the Sovietsproduce SS-25 stages which are interchangeable with the SS-20, theywould be in violation of the pact.   Among the issues remaining to be settled is an amendment, backedby the Democratic majority, which would require Senate approvalbefore any future administration could change how the United Statesinterprets the INF pact.   That amendment is the result of a fight between Reagan andDemocrats over the U.S. interpretation of the 1972 Anti-BallisticMissile pact.   Reagan asserts that his administration unilaterally can changehow the treaty is interpreted, a view disputed by congressionalDemocrats. The amendment banning any INF reinterpretation was addedby the Senate Foreign Relations Committee over the opposition ofRepublicans.   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said Monday thetreaty ``should be nailed in. It shouldn't be subject toreinterpretation.''   He said, ``I'm certainly not interested in any erosion of theSenate's constitutional role in treaty making. ... I don't proposeto give the store away.''</TEXT></DOC>
