The ability to make payments gradually over the term of a mortgage,energy savings, and tax benefits contribute to increased cost effectiveness.Conversely, financial benefits are reduced by interest payments, insurance,taxes, and various fees linked to the (higher) sale price of an energy-efficienthome. Accounting for these factors can yield a strikingly different picturefrom those given by commonly used ``engineering'' indicators, such assimple payback time, internal rate of return, or net present value (NPV),which are based solely on incremental costs and energy savings. Thisanalysis uses actual energy savings data and incremental constructioncosts to evaluate the mortgage cash flow for 79 of the 144 energy-efficienthomes constructed in Minnesota under the Energy-Efficient Housing DemonstrationProgram (EEHDP) initiated in 1980 by the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency.Using typical lending terms and fees, we find that the mean mortgage-NPVderived from the homeowners' real cash flow (including construction andfinancing costs) is 20% lower than the standard engineering-NPV of theconservation investment: $7981 versus $9810. For eight homes, the mortgage-NPVbecomes negative once we account for the various mortgage-related effects.Sensitivities to interest rates, down payment, loan term, and marginaltax rate are included to illustrate the often large impact of alternativeassumptions about these parameters. The most dramatic effect occurs whenthe loan term is reduced from 30 to 15 years and the mortgage NPV fallsto -$925. We also evaluate the favorable Federal Home Administration(FHA) terms actually applied to the EEHDP homes. 8 refs., 4 figs., 3tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
