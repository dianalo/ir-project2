(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Mikhail S. Gorbachev's gradual approachto change in the Soviet Union may lead to economic or politicaldisaster, Soviet human rights activist Andrei Sakharov toldscholars at Harvard University.   ``Waiting longer for the radicalization of perestroika is out ofthe question,'' the 68-year-old physicist said Thursday at aluncheon with Harvard officials and Soviet affairs specialistshosted by Derek Bok, the university's president.   ``If we allow this to go on, we are threatened with chaos,''Sakharov said after giving a critical review of his country'sproblems. ``We may be threatened with a military coup. We may bethreatened with famine.   ``This state is now at a historic moment. It could tip left orright. We have to find a way to hold our course.''   Sakharov said the most immediate danger is the economy, and hejoked that ``a good way to tell whether someone is an optimist or apessimist'' is to ask whether he thinks economic disaster willstrike in ``one, two or five years.''   The luncheon, also attended by Sakharov's wife, Elena Bonner,was held at the residence of Harvard President Derek Bok. Sakharovspoke through a translator.   Ms. Bonner, who has also been a longtime critic of Sovietpolicies, urged Western nations not to get carried away withuncritical applause for Soviet reforms and not to stop pressing forchange.   ``The Soviet people are overjoyed to find that, in fact, ourcountry is a living entity,'' she said, recalling the recentCongress of People's Deputies, where open debates kept the nationriveted to its television screens.   ``The whole country was amazed and enthusiastic to see that weare alive, that we haven't lost our reason because of the hunger,the trials, the falsification that we've suffered,'' she said. ``Ifonly the West can keep itself from lousing things up.''   Sakharov, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1975, was banished tointernal exile in the city of Gorky for seven years aftercriticizing the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan. He was releasedin 1986 by Gorbachev and has since been allowed to speak out andtravel freely.   He is a deputy in the new, 2,500-member congress and has emergedas one of the leaders of an independent bloc of about 400 delegatescalling for speedier reforms aimed at democratizing the country anddecentralizing the economy.</TEXT></DOC>
