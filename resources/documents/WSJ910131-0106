The administration argued in the past for more researchbefore taking corrective action, but officials now contendthe U.S. is adequately attacking the problem withenvironmental measures taken for unrelated reasons. Theseinclude the phase-out of chlorofluorocarbons, which isdesigned to save the protective stratospheric ozone layer,and Clean Air Act provisions aimed at curbing utilityemissions of sulfur dioxide.</LP><TEXT>   According to a brochure prepared by the administration,these steps will have the effect of bringing emissions ofgreenhouse gases in the year 2000 to levels equal to, orbelow, 1987 levels.   In the past, the administration argued that furtherscientific study was needed to determine whether the nationshould undertake efforts to cut emissions of carbon dioxide.While there is no consensus, many scientists believe thebuildup of carbon dioxide and other so-called greenhousegases threatens to cause a disastrous warming of the earth.   The administration's new approach comes as delegatesworld-wide are preparing to meet in Chantilly, Va., next weekto begin work on a treaty to address climate change.Environmental groups and some lawmakers have pushed the U.S.to use the session to agree to specific targets or timetablesfor reducing carbon dioxide, as most major industrializednations have done.   In the brochure, the administration argues for acomprehensive approach to the problem-taking into account allgases, rather than just focusing on carbon dioxide, andaddressing all sources of those gases and all the policies ofvarious nations. Administration officials contend that fromsuch a perspective, the U.S. is doing more to combat theproblem than other industrial nations.   Daniel Becker, a Sierra Club official, said, &quot;What theyare doing is trying to take the public's eye off the ball.The ball is carbon dioxide. That's the major greenhouse gas.&quot;Mr. Becker also disputed the administration's assertion thatit is doing more than other nations.   The U.S. refusal to agree to curbs on carbon dioxideemissions reflects the views of White House Chief of StaffJohn Sununu and other officials who have been stronglyopposed to any action on global warming. In the past, otherofficials, notably Environmental Protection Agency chiefWilliam Reilly, have supported setting targets for suchemissions. Mr. Reilly ranks combatting global warming amongthe top environmental priorities for the nation.   However, a spokesman said Mr. Reilly considers theadministration's effort to focus on all gases and take intoaccount everything nations are doing &quot;a constructive step inthe right direction that acknowledges the problem and talksabout stabilization.&quot;   Some administration officials hope that the new way oflooking at the problem will serve as the basis for aneventual agreement to set targets.</TEXT></DOC>
