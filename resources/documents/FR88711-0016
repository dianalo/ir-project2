Generally, these proposed regulationsunder section 401(a)(4) clarified existing law. In addition, the proposedregulations under sections 401 and 411 conformed the regulations to section301 of the Retirement Equity Act of 1984 (REA). A public hearing on theproposed regulations was announced in 51 FR 12341 and held on May 22, 1986.After consideration of all comments regarding the proposed regulations,such proposed regulations are adopted as revised by this Treasury Decision.<ITAG tagnum="84">Nondiscrimination Requirements </ITAG>Section 401(a)(4) of the Code provides that a qualified plan must provideeither contributions or benefits that do not discriminate in favor of employeeswho are officers, shareholders or highly compensated (the prohibited group).The regulations provide that the availability of an optional form of benefit(as defined in these regulations) under a pension, profit-sharing or stockbonus plan may not discriminate in form or operation in favor of the prohibitedgroup or, generally for plan years after December 31, 1988, highly compensatedemployees. This position affirms the position taken in Rev. Rul. 85-59,1985-1 CB 135, which was discussed in the preamble to the proposed regulations.These regulations provide guidance on the applicability of section 401(a)(4)to the availability of optional forms of benefits. The final regulations provide that an optional form of benefit is discriminatoryunder section 401(a)(4) if such optional form is not currently availableto a group of employees that satisfies the minimum coverage requirementof section 410(b) and effectively available to a group of employees that,based on all the facts and circumstances, does not substantially favoremployees in the highly compensated group. Generally, an optional formof benefit under a plan is discriminatory if the group of employees towhom the benefit is currently available fails to satisfy one or more ofthe applicable section 410(b) tests enumerated in andSection;1.401(a)-4 Qandamp;A-2.Finally, the final regulations reflect the amendment to section 401(a)(4)incorporating the new section 414(q) definition of highly compensated employeesin whose favor discrimination is prohibited as of the applicable effectivedate under the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (section 1114(a) of the Tax ReformAct of 1986, 100 Stat. 2448 (TRA '86)).With respect to an optional form of benefit that is contingent on satisfactionof specified eligibility conditions, the fact that an employee may subsequentlysatisfy the conditions is generally not sufficient to demonstrate nondiscrimination.For example, if a plan provides that a single sum distribution option isavailable only to an employee with a net worth of at least $100,000, thefact that an employee may, in the future, have a net worth of at least$100,000 does not support treating this optional form of benefit as currentlyavailable to such employee. However, in making a determination of currentavailability, the regulations provide that an employer may disregard certainenumerated conditions such as conditions requiring termination of employment,disability or hardship. In addition, in making this determination, theemployer generally may disregard conditions based on years of service and/orage. The final regulations further provide that in determining whether an optionalform of benefit under a plan is discriminatory under section 401(a)(4),the term ``plan'' has the meaning that such term has for other purposesunder section 401(a)(4). Future regulations under section 401(a)(4) willamplify this definition of ``plan''.The final regulations also provide that the Commissioner may provide suchadditional tests and safe harbors as may be necessary or appropriate fordetermining whether an optional form of benefit is discriminatory undersection 401(a)(4). The Commissioner may exercise this authority only throughthe publication of revenue rulings, notices, and other documents of generalapplicability, rather than on an individual basis. This limitation on theCommissioner's authority, and similar limitation on the Commissioner'sauthority, and similar limitations set forth elsewheree in this regulation,should not be read as raising any inferences with respect to the Commissioner'sexercise of authority where there is a delegation of authority withoutsimilar limiting language in this regulation or in other regulations pursuantto sections of the Internal Revenue Code.The final regulations make revisions to andSection; 1.401(a)-4 to reflectchanges made to section 401(a)(4) by TRA '86. Other changes in style andorganization have been made in order to improve clarity and resolve areasthat commentators have noted as being ambiguous. <ITAG tagnum="84">REA and TRA '86 Requirements </ITAG>Section 401(a)(25) of the Code, added by section 301 of REA, affirms thepositions taken by the Service in Rev. Rul. 79-90, 1979-1 CB 155, and Rev.Rul. 81-12, 1981-1 CB 228, and provides that a defined benefit plan shallnot be treated as providing definitely determinable benefits unless theactuarial assumptions used to determine the amount of any benefit are specifiedin the plan in a way that precludes employer discretion. Rev. Ruls. 79-90and 81-12 are discussed in greater length in the preamble to the proposedregulations.Section 411(d)(6) of the Code, as amended by section 301(a)(1) of REA,provides that, in general, a plan will not satisfy the requirements ofsection 411 if the accrued benefit of a participant is decreased by anamendment of the plan, other than an amendment described in section 412(c)(8)or section 4281 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974(ERISA). Section 411(d)(6) also provides that a plan amendment that hasthe effect of eliminating or reducing an early retirement benefit, a retirement-typesubsidy or an optional form of benefit, with respect to benefits accruedbefore the later of the amendment's adoption date or effective date (includingbenefits accrued prior to such date during the year in which such dateoccurs), shall be treated as impermissibly reducing accrued benefits. Anexception is provided to the extent that such amendments are permittedunder regulations promulgated by the Secretary. Also, section 411(d)(6)(C)contains an exception applicable to certain employee stock ownership plansadded by section 1898(f)(1)(A) of TRA '86.Many commentators requested guidance as to which benefits, rights and featuresare protected under section 411(d)(6). In response, the final regulationsprovide general guidance with respect to those benefits that are protectedunder section 411(d)(6) (``section 411(d)(6) protected benefits'' as definedin these regulations). With one exception, the regulations do not providespecific guidance with respect to the benefits described in section 411(d)(6)(A),early retirement benefits, or retirement-type subsidies. Thus, for example,the regulations do not address the extent to which a plant closing or shutdownbenefit under a plan constitutes an early retirement benefit or a retirement-typesubsidy. The exception is contained in Qandamp;A-3 of andSection; 1.411(d)-4and provides that the defined benefit feature of a benefit under a definedbenefit plan and the separate account feature of a benefit under a definedcontribution plan are protected under section 411(d)(6)(A). Also, the regulationsclarify that some benefits may be covered by more than one category ofsection 411(d)(6) protected benefits. Thus, the same benefit may be a benefitdescribed in section 411(d)(6)(A) and an early retirement benefit or retirement-typesubsidy described in section 411(d)(6)(B)(i)). The final regulations provide detailed guidance describing ``optional formsof benefit.'' (The term ``alternative forms of benefit'', which was usedin the proposed regulation, has been replaced, as appropriate, by the terms``optional forms of benefit'' and ``section 411(d)(6) protected benefit.'')Generally, each separate benefit distribution form under a plan is treatedas a separate optional form of benefit protected under section 411(d)(6).Accordingly, any differences with respect to the timing, payment schedule,medium of benefit distribution, and election rights with respect to suchdistributions are generally treated as creating separate optional formsof benefit.This regulation creates no inference with respect to whether, before anemployee has satisfied the applicable eligibility conditions, a contingentbenefit (e.g. subsidized early retirement benefit) is or is not taken intoaccount for purposes of determining the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporationvariable rate premium imposed by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Actof 1987. Several commentators requested clarification regarding the applicationof section 411(d)(6) to certain plan amendments providing a particularoptional form of benefit, e.g., a single sum distribution form for limitedperiods of time. Qandamp;A-1 of andSection; 1.411(d)-4 is revised to addressan issue raised by such amendments under section 411(d)(6). In particular,Qandamp;A-1 notes that certain patterns of such plan amendments may resultin section 411(d)(6) protected benefits. In addition, in response to several commentators, new Qandamp;As-2 and 3are included to provide guidance for situations in which certain section411(d)(6) protected benefits may be eliminated outside the scope of thetransitional rule provided in these regulations. Qandamp;A-2 provides generalguidance on the elimination or reduction of such benefits and specificallyaddresses certain situations, including mergers, transfers, benefit annuitizationand similar situations; distribution options in cash or employer stock;amendments to conform to statutory requirements; amendments to eliminatecertain optional survivor payment percentages provided in joint and survivorannuity distribution options; and certain other amendments eliminatingor reducing particular optional forms of benefit in specific circumstances.Qandamp;A-2 also addresses the effect of the selection of a particular optionalform of benefit and provides an example of this concept in the contextof a terminating plan in paragraph (a)(2). It is anticipated that similarconcepts will be applied in interpreting the requirements of section 401(a)(2).In addition, Qandamp;A-2 addresses the extent to which employee stock ownershipplans (ESOPS) and non-ESOP stock bonus plans are excepted from the section411(d)(6) prohibitions against the elimination or reduction of protectedbenefits. In this context, to assure that the ESOP exception cannot beused to eliminate optional forms of benefit with respect to non-ESOP benefits,Qandamp;A-2 requires, in general, that the benefits to which this exceptionis applied be held in an ESOP for a five year period prior to any amendmentwith respect to such benefits pursuant to this exception. It further providesthat the Commissioner may provide additional rules and exceptions withrespect to this ESOP continuity requirement. The Commissioner may exercisethis authority only through the publication of revenue rulings, notices,and other documents of general applicability, rather than on an individualbasis. Comments are solicited with respect to necessary or appropriaterules and exceptions. In particular, comments are solicited with respectto the appropriateness of applying the rules and exceptions provided inQandamp;A-18 of Notice 88-56 (with respect to the continuity of investmentrequirement for purposes of section 72(t)(2)(C)) for purposes of the ESOPcontinuity requirement for the ESOP exception in andSection; 1.411(d)-6 Qandamp;A-2.Qandamp;A-3 provides guidance on situations involving the transfer (or anyother transaction having a similar effect, such as the amendment of a definedbenefit plan into a defined contribution plan) of benefits between andamong defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans. This Qandamp;Aclarifies that the defined benefit feature of an employee's benefit undera defined benefit plan and the separate account feature of an employee'sbenefit under a defined contribution plan are section 411(d)(6) protectedbenefits. Thus, such features may not be eliminated with respect to benefitsalready accrued. However, the Qandamp;A clarifies that a plan may permitan employee to elect to have his benefit transferred if the plan is permittedat such time to make benefits available for distribution to such individual.Of course, in such case, the employer may not require a transfer, but mustpermit an employee to reject the transfer option and to preserve all ofhis section 411(d)(6) protected benefits accrued under the plan. This regulationdoes not address the transition rule requirements of section 1112 of TRA'86 which provisions may restrict the amount of benefits that may be transferredfrom a plan that would fail to satisfy the requirements of section 401(a)(26).With the publication of these regulations, the suspension imposed in determinationand examination cases which involve transfers from defined benefit plansto defined contribution plans will be lifted to the extent such transfersinvolve transactions addressed by these regulations that do not includea transfer of excess assets. These cases will be processed in accordancewith the relevant positions of these regulations and plan sponsors willbe provided the opportunity, if applicable, to make timely plan amendments.No inference is intended as to the implications of these transactions underTitle I or IV of ERISA. Plan administrators who have a ruling request insuspension due to the study of transfer issues but believe that their requestshould now be released from suspense should contact the appropriate KeyDistrict Office.Both Qandamp;A-2 and Qandamp;A-3 include a delegation of authority to the Commissionerto permit the elimination of certain optional forms of benefit withoutthe plan being treated as violating section 411(d)(6). The Commissionermay exercise this authority only through the publication of revenue rulings,notices, and other documents of general applicability, rather than on anindividual basis.The final regulations continue to provide that a pension plan does notsatisfy the definitely determinable requirement of section 401(a), includingsection 401(a)(25), if any section 411(d)(6) protected benefit is conditionedon employer discretion. (The term ``discretion'' refers to both consentand other forms of discretion.) Of course, the definitely determinablerequirement is not limited to section 411(d)(6) protected benefits underpension plans. The final regulations also continue to provide that section411(d)(6) prohibits any qualified plan, including any profit-sharing orstock bonus plan that is not subject to the definitely determinable benefitrequirement, from containing such employer discretion provisions with respectto section 411(d)(6) protected benefits. Not only do such provisions raiseconcerns about discrimination under section 401(a)(4), but these provisionseffectively enable an employer to eliminate or reduce a section 411(d)(6)protected benefit. Of course, a one-time increase in the normal retirementbenefit, that is contingent on an event with independent and substantialbusiness significance (for example, the cessation of operations at a particularfacility), is not treated as violative of section 411(d)(6) merely becausethe event is within the control of the employer.The final regulations clarify that a qualified plan may condition the availabilityof a section 411(d)(6) protected benefit on satisfaction of objective,nondiscretionary, and clearly ascertainable criteria specifically set forthin the plan. For example, a plan may limit the availability of a particularsection 411(d)(6) protected benefit to those employees who meet objectivestandards, consistently applied, with respect to the insurability of theemployee or the existence of extreme financial need. The prohibition againstthe exercise of employer discretion is not violated where the employerreasonably and consistently applies such objective and clearly ascertainablecriteria.Qandamp;A-6 (formerly Qandamp;A-5) of andSection; 1.411(d)-4 is revised to stateaffirmatively that any objective criteria imposed upon the availabilityof an optional form of benefit must not be discriminatory in form or operation.Other changes in style and organization have been made in order to improveclarity and resolve areas that commentators have noted as being ambiguous.<ITAG tagnum="84">Plan Amendments</ITAG>Employers with plans that condition the availability of section 411(d)(6)protected benefits on employer discretion or on a discriminatory conditionmust eliminate (a) employer discretion provisions applicable to the availabilityof section 411(d)(6) protected benefits, and (b) other conditions thatdiscriminate impermissibly with respect to optional forms of benefit. Alternatively,prior to the transitional period effective date with respect to such plan,and employer may eliminate optional forms of benefit (including early orlate retirement benefits) and retirement-type subsidies that are subjectto discretion provisions or other conditions that discriminate. In addition,existing plans that contain conditions applicable to an optional form ofbenefit that may reasonably be expected to discriminate may be amendedto eliminate either such conditions or the optional form of benefit subjectto such conditions. For purposes of these regulations, a condition mayreasonably be expected to discriminate if it results in a significant possibilitythat discrimination will result in operation. Thus, this rule does notrequire a determination that the condition does or is more likely thannot to result in discrimination. The determination of whether a conditionmay reasonably be expected to discriminate for purposes of these plan amendmentrules must be made on the basis of the seventy percent test of section410(b)(1)(A) or the nondiscriminatory classification test of section 410(b)(1)(B)as such tests exist prior to the effective date of the amendments madeto section 410(b) by section 1112(a) of TRA '86. Thus, a condition maynot reasonably be expected to discriminate for purposes of these rulesmerely because it results in a significant possibility that discriminationwill result because of the amendments made to section 410(b) by section1112(a) of TRA '86. A condition that may be disregarded in determiningthe availability of optional forms of benefit, such as a condition requiringtermination of employment or disability, may not reasonably be expectedto discriminate. Similarly, conditions imposing age or service requirementsmay not reasonably be expected to discriminate. Plans may not be amendedto add conditions that result in a restriction of the availability of anoptional form of benefit provided under the plan with respect to benefitsaccrued prior to such amendment.In response to comments, the final regulations also provide that, in lieuof eliminating the particular optional form of benefit or retirement-typesubsidy, the employer may substitute nondiscriminatory objective criteriameeting the standards set forth in Qandamp;A-6 of andSection; 1.411(d)-4 foremployer discretion or a discriminatory condition to which such benefitis subject.<ITAG tagnum="84">Effective Dates of This Regulation</ITAG>Many commentators requested that the effective dates for compliance withthese regulations be extended and, in particular, that the time periodfor making any necessary amendment to plans affected by these regulationsbe amended to conform to the dates for making plan amendments requiredby section 1140 of TRA '86. In response to these comments, the effectivedate provisions of these regulations have been amended in four primaryrespects.First, the effective dates for compliance with these regulations have beenrevised. The revised effective date rules applicable to section 401(a)(4)are set forth in andSection; 1.401(a)-4 Qandamp;A-6 and those applicable tosection 411(d)(6) are set forth in andSection; 1.411(d)-4 Qandamp;A-9. Withrespect to existing plans (as defined in these regulations), the revisedeffective dates include an extension providing that the applicable effectivedate is the first day of the first plan year commencing on or after January1, 1989.Second, the effective date is extended for new plans (as defined in theseregulations) that contain provisions with respect to the availability ofbenefits that violate the requirements of these regulations, which plansreceive a favorable determination letter pursuant to an application filedbefore July 11, 1988. Such new plans are treated as existing plans in determiningthe applicable effective date.Third, these regulations have been amended to provide that, subject tocertain conditions, existing plans and certain new plans that are treatedas existing pans may defer plan amendments until the date for amendingplans to comply with the requirements of section 410(b) as amended by TRA'86 (in general the first plan year commencing on or after January 1, 1989).The availability of this delayed amendment date is conditioned on compliancewith the following requirements: (1) selection by the plan sponsor of oneof the amendment alternatives permitted under the transitional rules setforth in these regulations by no later than the effective date for theplan as set forth in these regulations; (2) operational compliance withsuch selected amendment alternatives commencing as of such effective date;and (3) amendment by the delayed amendment date that, when made, is bothconsistent with the selected amendment as evidenced by plan practice andretroactive to the date by which the plan is required to comply with theseregulations in operation.The provisions of Notice 87-57, 1987-35 I.R.B. 10, with respect to theapplication of the section 1140 effective date for TRA '86 amendments tocertain terminated plans are applicable to plans otherwise eligible fora deferred effective date for amendments under these sections. Thus, aplan terminating on or after the first day of the first plan year beginningafter December 31, 1988, which plan is an existing plan or a new plan treatedas an existing plan, and which plan is eligible to defer amendments requiredby this regulation to the date for making amendments required by TRA '86,must be amended no later than plan termination to comply with the provisionsof these sections. However, such a plan is not required to be amended tocomply with the provisions of these sections in the event that terminationoccurs on or before the first day of the 1989 plan year.Finally, the effective dates have been extended for certain plans thatare adoptions of master and prototype plans.<ITAG tagnum="84">Title I of ERISA</ITAG>The regulations under section 411 are also applicable to provisions ofTitle I. Thus, these requirements also apply to employee plans subjectto Title I of ERISA. Under section 101 of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of1978 [43 FR 47713], the Secretary of the Treasury has jurisdiction overthe subject matter addressed in these regulations. Therefore, under section104 of the Reorganization Plan, these regulations apply when the Secretaryof Labor exercises authority under Title I of ERISA.<ITAG tagnum="84">Special Analyses</ITAG>The Commissioner of Internal Revenue has determined that this is not amajor rule as defined in Executive Order 12291. Therefore, a RegulatoryImpact Analysis is not required. Although a notice of proposed rulemakingwas issued, the Internal Revenue Service concluded that the notice andpublic procedure requirements of 5 U.S.C. 533 did not apply because therules provided herein are interpretative. Accordingly, these final regulationsdo not constitute regulation's subject to the Regulatory Flexibility Act(5 U.S.C. chapter 6).<ITAG tagnum="84">Drafting Information</ITAG>The principal author of these regulations is Nancy J.

This section addresses the application of section401(a)(4) only to optional forms of benefit under a plan. Generally, thedetermination of whether an optional form is nondiscriminatory under section401(a)(4) is made by reference to the availability of such optional form,and not by reference to the utilization or actual receipt of such optionalform. See Qandamp;A-2 of this section. Even though an optional form of benefitunder a plan may be nondiscriminatory under section 401(a)(4) and thisandSection; 1.401(a)-4 because the availability of such optional form doesnot impermissibly favor employees in the highly compensated group, suchplan may fail to satisfy section 401(a)(4) with respect to the amount ofcontributions or benefits or with respect to other benefits, rights andfeatures if, for example, the method of calculation or the amount or valueof benefits payable under such optional form impermissibly favors the highlycompensated group. See andSection; 1.411(d)-4, Qandamp;A-1 for the definitionof ``optional form of benefit.''(2) <T3>Nondiscrimination requirements. </T3>Each optional form of benefitprovided under a plan is subject to the nondiscrimination requirement ofsection 401(a)(4) and thus the availability of each optional form of benefitmust not discriminate in favor of the employees described in section 401(a)(4)in whose favor discrimination is prohibited (the ``highly compensated group'').See paragraph (b) of this Qandamp;A-1 for a description of the employeesincluded in such group. This is true without regard to whether a particularoptional form of benefit is the actuarial equivalent of any other optionalform of benefit under the plan. Thus, for example, a plan may not condition,or otherwise limit, the availability of a single sum distribution of anemployee's benefit in a manner that impermissibly favors the highly compensatedgroup.(b) <T3>Highly compensated group. </T3>For plan years commencing prior to theapplicable effective date for the amendment made to section 401(a)(4) bysection 1114 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA '86), the highly compensatedgroup consists of those employees who are officers, shareholders, or highlycompensated. For plan years beginning on or after the applicable effectivedate of the amendments to section 401(a)(4) made by TRA '86, the highlycompensated group consists of those employees who are highly compensatedwithin the meaning of section 414(q). The amendment to section 401(a)(4)made by section 1114 of TRA '86 is generally effective for plan years commencingafter December 31, 1988. See section 1114(a) of TRA '86.Q-2: How is it determined whether an optional form of benefit satisfiesthe nondiscrimination requirements of section 401(a)(4)?A-2: (a) <T3>Nondiscrimination requirement._</T3>(1) <T3>In general. </T3>An optional form of benefit under a plan is nondiscriminatoryunder section 401(a)(4) only if the requirements of paragraphs (a)(2) and(a)(3) of this Qandamp;A-2 are satisfied with respect to such optional form.The determination of whether an optional form of benefit satisfies theserequirements is made by reference to the availability of the optional form,and not by reference to the utilization or actual receipt of such optionalform. Thus, an optional form of benefit that satisfies the requirementsof paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this Qandamp;A-2 is nondiscriminatoryunder section 401(a)(2) even though the highly compensated group disproportionatelyutilizes such optional form. However, the composition of the group of employeeswho actually receive benefits in an optional form may be relevant in determiningwhether such optional form satisfies the requirement of paragraph (a)(3)of this Qandamp;A-2 with respect to effective availability.(2) <T3>Current availability_</T3>(i) <T3>Plan years prior to TRA '86 effective date. </T3>Except as providedin paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this Qandamp;A-2, for plan years prior to theeffective date of the amendments made to section 401(b) by section 1112(a)of TRA '86, the requirement of this paragraph (a)(2) is satisfied onlyif the group of employees to whom the optional form is currently availablesatisfies either the seventy percent test of section 410(b)(1)(A) or thenondiscriminatory classification test of section 410(b)(1)(B).(ii) <T3>Plan years commencing on or after TRA '86 effective date_</T3>(A) <T3>In general. </T3>Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of thisQandamp;A-2, for plan years commencing on or after the effective date forthe amendments made to section 410(b) by section 1112(a) of TRA '86, therequirement of this paragraph (a)(2) is satisfied only if the group ofemployees to whom the optional form is currently available satisfies eitherthe percentage test set forth in section 410(b)(1)(A), the ratio test setforth in section 410(b)(1)(B), or the nondiscriminatory classificationtest set forth in section 410(b)(2)(A)(i) (and, in such case, the averagebenefit percentage test in section 410(b)(2)(A)(ii) is satisfied with respectto the employer).<ITAG tagnum="21">(B) <T3>Example. </T3>In 1990, employer X maintains a defined benefit planand a profit-sharing plan that is a qualified cash or deferred arrangementunder section 401(k). Both plans satisfy the percentage test in section410(b)(1)(A) with respect to coverage. The defined benefit plan providesfor a single sum distribution available only to employees in the headquartersoffice. This group of employees fails the percentage and ratio tests ofsection 410(b), but satisfies the nondiscriminatory classification testset forth in section 410(b)(2)(A)(i). However, the employer does not satisfythe average benefit percentage test in section 401(b)(2)(A)(ii). Therefore,the current availability of the optional form of benefit does not satisfythe requirement of this paragraph (a)(2).</ITAG>(iii)<T3> Special rule for certain governmental or church plans.</T3> Plansdescribed in section 410(c) will be treated as satisfying the current availabilitytest of this paragraph (a)(2) if the group of employees with respect towhom the optional form is currently available satisfies the requirementsof section 401(a)(3) as in effect on September 1, 1974.(iv) <T3>Effective data for TRA '86 amendments to section 410(b).</T3> The amendmentsto section 410(b) made by section 1112(a) of TRA '86 are generally effectivefor plan years commencing after December 31, 1988. See section 1112(e)(1)of TRA '86.(v) <T3>Elimination of optional forms</T3>_(A)<T3> In general.</T3> Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (a)(2)(ii)of this Qandamp;A-2, in the case of an optional form of benefit that hasbeen eliminated under a plan with respect to specified employees for benefitsaccrued after the later of the eliminating amendment's adoption date oreffective date, the determination of whether such optional form satisfiesthis paragraph (a)(2) with respect to such employees is to be made immediatelyprior to the elimination. Accordingly, if, as of the later of the adoptiondate or effective date of an amendment eliminating an optional form withrespect to future benefit accruals, the current availability of such optionalform immediately prior to such amendment satisfies this paragraph (a)(2),then the optional form will be treated as satisfying this paragraph (a)(2)for all subsequent years.<ITAG tagnum="21">(B) <T3>Example.</T3> A profit-sharing plan that provides for a single sumdistribution available to all employees on termination of employment isamended January 1, 1990, to eliminate such single sum optional form ofbenefit with respect to benefits accrued after January 1, 1991. As of January1, 1991, the single sum optional form of benefit is available to a groupof employees that satisfies the percentage test of section 410(b)(1)(A).As of January 1, 1995, all nonhighly compensated employees who were entitledto the single sum optional form of benefit have terminated from employmentwith the employer and taken a distribution of their benefits. The onlyremaining employees who have a right to take a portion of their benefitsin the form of a single sum distribution on termination of employment arehighly compensated employees. Because the availability of the single sumoptional form of benefit satisfied the current availability test as ofJanuary 1, 1991, the availability of such optional form of benefit is deemedto continue to satisfy the current availability test of this paragraph(a)(2).</ITAG>(3) <T3>Effective availability</T3>_(i)<T3> In general.</T3> The requirement of this paragraph (a)(3) is satisfiedonly if, based on the facts and circumstances, the group of employees towhom the optional form is effectively available does not substantiallyfavor the highly compensated group. This is the case even if the optionalform is, or has been, currently available to a group of employees thatsatisfies the applicable requirements in paragraph (a)(2) (i) or (ii) ofthis Qandamp;A-2.(ii) <T3>Examples.</T3> The provisions of paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this Qandamp;A-2can be illustrated by the following examples:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 1.</T3> Employer X maintains a defined benefit plan that coversboth of the 2 highly compensated employees of the employer and 8 of thetwelve nonhighly compensated employees of the employer. Plan X providesfor a normal retirement benefit payable as an annuity and based on a normalretirement age of 65, and an early retirement benefit payable upon terminationin the form of an annuity to employees who terminate from service withthe employer on or after age 55 with 30 or more years of service. Eachof the 2 employees of employer X who are in the highly compensated groupcurrently meet the age and service requirement, or will have 30 years ofservice by the time they reach age 55. All but 2 of the 8 nonhighly compensatedemployees of employer X who are covered by the plan were hired on or afterage 35 and thus, cannot qualify for the early retirement benefit provision.Even though the group of employees to whom the early retirement benefitis currently available does not impermissibly favor the highly compensatedgroup by reason of disregarding age and service, these facts and circumstancesindicate that the effective availability of the early retirement benefitin plan X substantially favors the highly compensated group.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 2.</T3> Assume the same facts as in <T3>Example 1</T3> except that the early retirement benefit is added bya plan amendment first adopted, announced and effective December 1, 1991,and is available only to employees who terminate from employment with theemployer prior to December 15, 1991. Further assume that all employeeswere hired prior to attaining age 25, and that the group of employees whohave, or will have attained age 55 with 30 years of service, by December15, 1991, satisfies the ratio test of section 410(b)(1)(B). Finally, assumethat the only employees who terminate from employment with the employerduring the two week period in which the early retirement benefit is availableare employees in the highly compensated group. These facts and circumstancesindicate that the effective availability of the early retirement benefitsubstantially favors the highly compensated group. This is the case eventhough the limitation of the early retirement benefit to a specified periodsatisfies section 411(d)(6).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 3.</T3> Employer Y amends plan Y on June 30, 1990, to providefor a single sum distribution for employees who terminate from employmentwith the employer after June 30, 1990, and prior to January 1, 1991. Theavailability of this single sum distribution is conditioned on the employeehaving a particular disability at the time of termination of employment.The only employee of the employer who meets this disability requirementat the time of the amendment and thereafter through December 31, 1990,is a highly compensated employee. Generally, a disability condition withrespect to the availability of a single sum distribution may be disregardedin determining whether the current availability of such optional form ofbenefit is discriminatory. However, these facts and circumstances indicatethat the effective availability of the optional form of benefit substantiallyfavors the highly compensated group. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 4.</T3> Employer Z maintains a money purchase pension planthat covers all employees of the employer. The plan provides for distributionin the form of a joint and survivor annuity, a life annuity, or equal installmentsover 10 years. During the 1992 calendar year the employer winds up hisbusiness. In December of 1992, only two employees remain in the employmentof the employer, both of whom are highly compensated. Employer Z then amendsthe plan to provide for a single sum distribution to employees who terminatefrom employment on or after the date of the amendment. Both highly compensatedemployees terminate from employment on December 31, 1992, taking a singlesum distribution of their benefits. These facts and circumstances indicatethat the effective availability of the single sum optional form of benefitsubstantially favors the highly compensated group. </ITAG>(b) <T3>Application of tests</T3>_(1) <T3>Current availability</T3>_(i) <T3>In general.</T3> Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b),in determining whether an optional form of benefit that is subject to specifiedeligibility conditions is currently available to an employee for purposesof paragraph (a) of this Qandamp;A-2, the determination of current availabilitygenerally is to be based on the current facts and circumstances with respectto the employee (e.g., the employee's current compensation or the employee'scurrent net worth). Thus, for example, the fact that an employee may, inthe future, satisfy an eligibility condition generally does not cause anoptional form of benefit to be treated as currently available to such employee.(ii) <T3>Exceptions for age, service, employment termination and certain otherconditions</T3>_(A) <T3>Age and service conditions.</T3> For purposes of applying paragraph(a)(2) of this Qandamp;A-2, except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B)of this Qandamp;A-2, an age condition, a service condition, or both are tobe disregarded. For example, an employer that maintains a plan that providesfor an early retirement benefit payable as an annuity for employees indivision A, subject to a requirement that the employee has attained hisor her 55th birthday and has at least twenty years of service with theemployer, is to disregard the age and service conditions in determiningthe group of employees to whom the early retirement annuity benefit iscurrently available. Thus, the early retirement annuity benefit is treatedas currently available to all employees of division A, without regard totheir ages or years of service and without regard to whether they couldpotentially meet the age and service conditions prior to attaining theplan's normal retirement age. (B) <T3>Exception for certain age and service conditions.</T3> Age and serviceconditions that must be satisfied within a specified period of time maynot be disregarded pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this Qandamp;A-2.However, in determining the current availability of an optional form ofbenefit subject to such an age condition, service condition, or both, anemployer may project the age and service of employees to the last dateon which the optional form of benefit subject to the age condition or servicecondition (or both) is available under the plan. An employer's abilityto protect age and service to the last date on which the optional formof benefit is available under the plan is not cut off by a plan terminationoccurring prior to that date. Thus, for example, assume that an employermaintaining a plan that permits employees terminating from employment onor after age 55 between June 1, 1991 to May 31, 1992, to elect a singlesum distribution, decides to terminate the plan on December 31, 1991. Indetermining the group of employees to whom the single sum optional formof benefit is currently available, this employer may project employees'ages through May 31, 1992. (C) <T3>Certain other conditions disregarded.</T3> Conditions on the availabilityof optional forms of benefit requiring termination of employment, death,satisfaction of a specified health condition (or failure to meet such condition),disability, hardship, marital status, default on a plan loan secured bya participant's account balance, or execution of a covenant not to competemay be disregarded in determining the group of employees to whom an optionalform of benefit is currently available. (2) <T3>Employees taken into account</T3>. For purposes of applying paragraph(a) of this Qandamp;A-2, the tests are to be applied on the basis of theemployer's nonexcludable employees (whether or not they are participantsin the plan) in the same manner as such tests would be applied in determiningwhether the plan providing the optional form of benefit satisfies the testsunder section 410(b).(3) <T3>Definition of ``plan''</T3>. For purposes of applying paragraph (a)of this Qandamp;A-2, the term ``plan'' has the meaning that such term hasfor purposes of determining whether the amount of contributions or benefitsand whether other benefits, rights, and features are nondiscriminatoryunder section 401(a)(4).(4) <T3>Restructuring optional forms of benefit</T3>_(i) <T3>In general</T3>. For purposes of applying paragraph (a) of this Qandamp;A-2,the availability of two or more optional forms of benefit under a planmay be tested by restructuring such benefits into two or more restructuredoptional forms of benefit and testing the availability of such restructuredoptional forms of benefit. If two or more optional forms of benefit undera plan contain both common and distinct components, such optional formsof benefit may be restructured as a single optional form of benefit comprisingthe common component, and one or more optional forms of benefit comprisingeach distinct component. Components of optional forms of benefit may betreated as common only if they are identical with respect to all characteristicstaken into account under Qandamp;A-1(b) of andSection; 1.411(d)-4. The availabilityof each restructured optional form of benefit must satisfy the applicablenondiscrimination requirements of paragraph (a) of this Qandamp;A-2.<ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) <T3>Example</T3>. A profit-sharing plan covering all the employees of anemployer provides a single sum distribution option upon termination fromemployment for all employees earning less than $50,000 and a single sumdistribution option upon termination from employment after the attainmentof age 55 for all employees earning $50,000 or more. These distributionoptions are identical in all other respects. For purposes of applying section401(a)(4), such optional forms of benefit may be restructured into twodifferent optional forms of benefit: (A) a single sum distribution optionupon termination from employment after the attainment of age 55 for allemployees (i.e., the common component), and (B) a single sum distributionoption upon termination from employment before the attainment of age 55for all employees earning less than $50,000. The availability of each ofthese restructured optional forms of benefit must satisfy section 401(a)(4).</ITAG>(c) <T3>Commissioner may provide additional tests</T3>. The Commissioner mayprovide such additional factors, tests, and safe harbors as are necessaryor appropriate for purposes of determining whether the availability ofan optional form of benefit is discriminatory under section 401(a)(4).In addition, the Commissioner may provide that additional eligibility conditionsnot related directly or indirectly to compensation or wealth may be disregardedunder paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(C) of this Qandamp;A-2 in determining the currentavailability of an optional form of benefit. The Commissioner may providesuch additional guidance only through the publication of revenue rulings,notices or other documents of general applicability.Q-3: May a plan condition the availability of an optional form of benefiton employer discretion?A-3: No. Even if the availability of an optional form of benefit that isconditioned on employer discretion satisfies the nondiscrimination requirementsof section 401(a)(4), the plan providing the optional form of benefit willfail to satisfy certain other requirements of section 401(a), including,in applicable circumstances, the definitely determinable requirement ofsection 401(a) and the requirements of section 401(a)(25) and section 411(d)(6).See andSection; 1.411(d)-4.Q-4: Will a plan provision violate section 401(a)(4) merely because itrequires that an employee who terminates from service with the employerreceive a single sum distribution in the event that the present value ofthe employee's benefit is not more than $3,500, as permitted by sections411(a)(11) and 417(e)?A-4: No. A plan will not be treated as discriminatory under section 401(a)(4)merely because the plan mandates a single sum distribution when the presentvalue of an employee's benefit is not more than $3,500, as permitted bysections 411(a)(11) and 417(e). This is an exception to the general principlesof this section. (No similar provision exists excepting such single sumdistributions from the limits on employer discretion under section 411(d)(6).See andSection; 1.411(d)-4 Qandamp;A-4.)Q-5: If the availability of an optional form of benefit discriminates,or may reasonably be expected to discriminate, in favor of the highly compensatedgroup, what acceptable alternatives exist for amending the plan withoutviolating section 411(d)(6)?A-5: (a) <T3>Transitional rules_</T3>(1) <T3>In general. </T3>The following rules apply for purposes of making necessaryamendments to existing plans (as defined in Qandamp;A-6 of this section)under which the availability of an optional form of benefit violates thenondiscrimination requirements of section 401(a)(4) or may reasonably beexpected to violate such requirements. These transitional rules are providedunder the authority of section 411(d)(6), which allows the eliminationof certain optional forms of benefit if permitted by regulations, and section7805(b).(2) <T3>Nondiscrimination_</T3>(i) <T3>In general. </T3>The determination of whether the availability of anoptional form of benefit violates section 401(a)(4) is to be made in accordancewith Qandamp;A-2 of this section. In addition, the availability of a particularoptional form of benefit may reasonably be expected to violate the nondiscriminationrequirements of section 401(a)(4) if, under the applicable facts and circumstances,there is a significant possibility that the current availability of suchoptional form of benefit will impermissibly favor the highly compensatedgroup. This determination must be made on the basis of the seventy percenttest of section 410(b)(1)(A) or the nondiscriminatory classification testof section 410(b)(1)(B) as such tests existed prior to the effective dateof the amendments made to section 410(b) by section 1112(a) of TRA '86.Thus, a condition may not reasonably be expected to discriminate for purposesof these rules merely because it results in a significant possibility thatdiscrimination will result because of the amendments made to section 410(b)by section 1112(a) of TRA '86. In addition, the availability of an optionalform of benefit may not reasonably be expected to discriminate merely becauseof an age or service condition that may be disregarded in determining thecurrent availability of such optional form of benefit under paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A)of Qandamp;A-2 of this section. Similarly, the availability of an optionalform of benefit may not reasonably be expected to discriminate merely becauseof an age or service condition that, after permitted projection, does notcause such optional form to fail to satisfy the requirement of this paragraph(a)(2).(ii) <T3>Examples. </T3>The provisions of paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this Qandamp;A-5can be illustrated by the following examples:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1). </T3>A plan provides that a single sum distribution optionis available only to (A) employees earning $50,000 or more in the finalyear of employment, (B) employees who furnish evidence that they have anet worth above a certain specified amount, and (C) employees who presenta letter from an accountant or attorney declaring that it is in the employee'sbest interest to receive a single sum distribution. Whether the availabilityof such optional form of benefit discriminates depends on whether it meetsthe requirements of Qandamp;A-2 of this andSection; 1.401(a)-4. However, eachof the specified conditions limiting the availability of the optional formof benefit may reasonably be expected to discriminate in favor of the highlycompensated group in operation because of the likelihood of a significantpositive correlation between the ability to meet any of the specified conditionsand membership in the highly compensated group.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2). </T3>A plan limits the availability of a single sum distributionoption to employees employed in one particular division of the employer'scompany. All the employees of the company are participants in the plan.During the 1988 plan year, the division employs individuals who representa nondiscriminatory classification of that company's employees (under section410(b)(1)(B) prior to the effective date of the amendments made to section410(b) by section 1112(a) of TRA '86) and is unlikely to cease employingsuch a nondiscriminatory classification in the future. The availabilityof a single sum distribution under this plan does not result in discriminationduring the 1988 plan year and may not reasonably be expected to do so.</ITAG>(b) <T3>Transitional alternatives. </T3>If the availability of an optionalform of benefit under an existing plan is discriminatory under section401(a)(4), the plan must be amended either to eliminate the optional formof benefit or to make the availability of the optional form of benefitnondiscriminatory. For example, the availability of an optional form ofbenefit may be made nondiscriminatory by making such benefit availableto sufficient additional employees who are not in the highly compensatedgroup or by imposing nondiscriminatory objective criteria on its availabilitysuch that the group of employees to whom the benefit is available is nondiscriminatory.See Qandamp;A-6 of andSection; 1.411(d)-4 for requirements with respect tosuch objective criteria. If, under an exisitng plan, the availability ofan optional form of benefit may reasonably be expected to discriminate,the plan may be amended in the same manner permitted where the availabilityof an optional form of benefit is discriminatory. See paragraph (d) ofthis Qandamp;A-5 for rules limiting the period during which the availabilityof optional forms of benefit may be eliminated or reduced under this paragraph.(c) <T3>Compliance and amendment date provisions</T3>_(1) <T3>Operational compliance requirement</T3>. On or before the applicableeffective date for the plan (see Qandamp;A-6 of this section), the plan sponsormust select one of the alternatives permitted under paragraph (b) of thisQandamp;A-5 with respect to each affected optional form of benefit and theplan must be operated in accordance with this selection. This is an operationalrequirement and does not require a plan amendment prior to the period setforth in paragraph (c)(2) of this Qandamp;A-5. There is no special reportingrequirement under the Code or this section with respect to this selection.(2) <T3>Deferred amendment date</T3>. If paragraph (c)(1) of this Qandamp;A-5is satisfied, a plan amendment conforming the plan to the particular alternativeselected under paragraph (b) of this Qandamp;A-5 must be adopted within thetime period permitted for amending plans in order to meet the requirementsof section 410(b) as amended by TRA '86. Such conforming amendment mustbe consistent with the sponsor's selection as reflected by plan practiceduring the period from the effective date to the date the amendment isadopted. Thus, for example, if an existing calendar year noncollectivelybargained defined benefit plan has a single sum distribution form subjectto a discriminatory condition, that was available as of January 30, 1986(subject to such condition), and such employer makes one or more singlesum distributions available on or after the first day of the first planyear commencing on or after January 1, 1989, and before the plan amendment,then such employer may not adopt a plan amendment eliminating the singlesum distribution form. Instead, such employer must adopt an amendment makingthe distribution form available to a nondiscriminatory group of employeeswhile retaining the availability of such distribution form with respectto the group of employees to whom the benefit is already available. Similarly,any objective criteria that are adopted as part of such amendment mustbe consistent with the plan practice for the applicable period prior tothe amendment. A conforming amendment under this paragraph (c)(2) mustbe made with respect to each optional form of benefit for which such amendmentis required and must be retroactive to the applicable effective date.(d) <T3>Limitation on transitional alternatives</T3>. The transitional alternativespermitting the elimination or reduction of optional forms of benefit willnot violate section 411(d)(6) during the period prior to the applicableeffective date for the plan (see Qandamp;A-6 of this section). After theapplicable effective date, any amendment (other than one described in paragraph(c)(2) of this Qandamp;A-5) that eliminates or reduces an optional form ofbenefit or imposes new objective criteria restricting the availabilityof such optional form of benefit will fail to qualify for the exceptionto section 411(d)(6) provided in this Qandamp;A-5. This is the case withoutregard to whether the availability of the optional form of benefit is discriminatoryor may reasonably be expected to be discriminatory. Q-6: What are the effective dates for the rules in this section?A-6: (a) <T3>General effective date</T3>. Except as otherwise provided in this section,the provisions of this section are effective January 30, 1986.(b) <T3>New plans</T3>_(1) <T3>In general</T3>. Unless otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(2) of thisQandamp;A-6, plans that are either adopted or made effective on or afterJanuary 30, 1986, are ``new plans''. With respect to such new plans, thissection is effective January 30, 1986. This effective date is applicableto such plans whether or not they are collectively bargained.(2) <T3>Exception with respect to certain new plans</T3>. Plans that are newplans as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this Qandamp;A-6, under which theavailability of an optional form of benefit is discriminatory or may reasonablybe expected to be discriminatory, and that receive a favorable determinationletter that covered such plan provisions with respect to an applicationsubmitted prior to July 11, 1988, will be treated as existing plans withrespect to such optional form of benefit for purposes of the transitionalrules of this section. Thus, such plans are eligible for the complianceand amendment alternatives set forth in the transitional rule in Qandamp;A-5of this section.(c) <T3>Existing plans</T3>_(1) <T3>In general</T3>. Plans that are both adopted and in effect prior toJanuary 30, 1986, are ``existing plans''. In addition, new plans describedin paragraph (b)(2) of this Qandamp;A-6 are treated as existing plans withrespect to certain forms of benefit. Subject to the limitations in paragraph(d) of this Qandamp;A-6, the effective dates set forth in paragraphs (c)(2)and (c)(3) of this Qandamp;A-6 apply to these existing plans for purposesof this section.(2) <T3>Existing noncollectively bargained plans.</T3> With respect to existingnoncollectively bargained plans, this section is effective for the firstday of the first plan year commencing on or after January 1, 1989.(3) <T3>Existing collectively bargained plans</T3>. With respect to existingcollectively bargained plans, this section is effective for the later ofthe first day of the first plan year commencing on or after January 1,1989, or the first day of the first plan year that the requirements ofsection 410(b) as amended by TRA '86 apply to such plan.(d) <T3>Delayed effective dates not applicable to new optional forms of benefitor conditions</T3>_(1) <T3>In general</T3>. The delayed effective dates in paragraph (c) (2) and(3) of this Qandamp;A-6 for existing plans are applicable with respect toan optional form of benefit only if both the optional form of benefit andany applicable condition either causing the availability of such optionalform of benefit to be discriminatory or making it reasonable to expectthat the availability of such optional form will be discriminatory wereboth adopted and in effect prior to January 30, 1986. If the precedingsentence is not satisfied with respect to an optional form of benefit,this section is effective with respect to such optional form of benefitas if the plan were a new plan.(2) <T3>Exception for certain amendments covered by a favorable determinationletter. </T3>If a condition causing the availability of an optional formof benefit to be discriminatory, or to be reasonably expected to discriminate,was adopted or made effective on or after January 30, 1986, and a favorabledetermination letter that covered such plan provision is or was receivedwith respect to an application submitted before July 11, 1988, the effectivedate of this section with respect to such provision is the applicable effectivedate determined under the rules with respect to existing plans, as thoughsuch provision had been adopted and in effect prior to January 30, 1986.(e) <T3>Transitional rule effective date. </T3>The transitional rule providedin Qandamp;A-5 of this section is effective January 30, 1986.<T4>Par. 3. </T4>A new andSection; 1.411(d)-4 is added immediately afterandSection; 1.411(d)-3T to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1.411(d)-4 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Section 411(d)(6) protected benefits.</ITAG>Q-1: What are ``section 411(d)(6) protected benefits''?A-1: (a) <T3>In general. </T3>The term ``section 411(d)(6) protected benefit'' includesany benefit that is described in one or more of the following categories:(1) Benefits described in section 411(d)(6)(A),(2) Early retirement benefits and retirement-type subsidies described insection 411(d)(6)(B)(i), and(3) Optional forms of benefit described in section 411(d)(6)(B)(ii).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Such benefits, to the extent they have accrued, are subject to theprotection of section 411(d)(6) and, where applicable, the definitely determinablerequirement of section 401(a) (including section 401(a)(25)) and cannot,therefore, be reduced, eliminated or made subject to employer discretionexcept to the extent permitted by regulations.(b) <T3>Optional forms of benefit</T3>_(1) <T3>In general. </T3>An ``optional form of benefit'' is a distributionform with respect to an employee's benefit (described in paragraph (a)(1)and/or (a)(2) of this Qandamp;A-1) that is available under the plan and isidentical with respect to all features relating to the distribution form,including the payment schedule, timing, commencement, medium of distribution(e.g., in cash or in-kind), the portion of the benefit to which such distributionfeatures apply and the election rights with respect to such optional forms.To the extent there are any differences in such features, the plan providesseparate optional forms of benefit. Differences in amounts of benefits,methods of calculation, or values of distribution forms do not result inoptional forms of benefit for purposes of this rule. However, such amounts,methods of calculation, or values may be protected benefits within section411(d)(6)(A) and/or section 411(d)(6)(B)(i). See andSection; 1.401(a)-4 forfurther discussion and examples relating to optional forms of benefits.(2) <T3>Examples. </T3>The following examples illustrate the meaning of theterm ``optional form of benefit.'' Other issues, such as the requirementthat the optional forms satisfy section 401(a)(4), are not addressed inthese examples and no inferences are intended with respect to such requirements.Assume that the distribution forms, including those not described in theseexamples, provided under the plan in each of the following examples areidentical in all respects not described.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 1. </T3>A plan permits each participant to receive his benefitunder the plan as a single sum distribution; a level monthly distributionschedule over 15 years; a single life annuity; a joint and 50 percent survivorannuity; a joint and 75 percent survivor annuity; a joint and 50 percentsurvivor annuity with a benefit increase for the participant if the beneficiarydies before a specified date; and joint and 50 percent survivor annuitywith a 10 year certain feature. Each of these benefit distribution optionsis an optional form of benefit (without regard to whether the values ofthese options are actuarially equivalent).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 2. </T3>A plan permits each participant to receive his benefitunder the plan as a single life annuity commencing at termination fromemployment; a joint and 50 percent survivor annuity commencing at terminationfrom employment; a single sum distribution that is actuarially equivalentto the single life annuity determined by using a specified interest rate(X percent) for the employees of division A; and a single sum distributionsthat is actuarially equivalent to the single life annuity determined byusing an interst rate that is 80 percent of X percent for employees ofDivision B. This plan provides three optional forms of benefit. While theinterest rates used to determine the single sum distributions availableto the employees of Divisions A and the employees of Division B respectivelydiffer, this difference does not result in two single sum optional formsof benefit.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 3. </T3>A plan permits each participant who is employed bydivision A to receive his benefit in a single sum distribution payableupon termination from employment and each participant who is employed bydivision B in a single sum distribution payable upon termination from employmenton or after the attainment of age 50. This plan provides two single sumoptional forms of benefit.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 4. </T3>A plan permits each participant to receive his benefitin a single life annuity that commences in the month after the participant'stermination from employment or in a single life annuity that commencesupon the completion of five consecutive one year breaks in service. Theseare two optional forms of benefit.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 5. </T3>A profit-sharing plan permits each participant whois employed by division A to receive an in-service distribution upon thesatisfaction of objective criteria set forth in the plan designed to determinewhether the participant has a heavy and immediate financial need, and eachparticipant who is employed by division B to receive an in-service distributionupon the satisfaction of objective criteria set forth in the plan designedto determine whether the participant has a heavy and immediate financialneed attributable to extraordinary medical expenses. These in-service distributionoptions are two optional forms of benefits. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 6. </T3>A profit-sharing plan permits each participant whois employed by division A to receive an in-service distribution up to $5,000and each participant who is employed by division B to receive an in-servicedistribution of up to his total benefit. These in-service distributionoptions differ as to the portion of the accrued benefit that may be distributedin a particular form and are, therefore, two optional forms of benefit.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 7. </T3>A profit-sharing plan provides for a single sum distributionon termination of employment. The plan is amended in 1991 to eliminatethe single sum optional form of benefit with respect to benefits accruedafter the date of amendment. This single sum optional form of benefit continuesto be a single optional form of benefit although, over time, the percentageof various employees' accrued benefits that are potentially payable underthis single sum may vary because the form is only available with respectto benefits accrued up to and including the date of the amendment. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 8. </T3>A profit-sharing plan permits each participant to receivea single sum distribution of his benefit in cash or in the form of a specifiedclass of employer stock. This plan provides two single sum distributionoptinal forms of benefit. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 9. </T3>A stock bonus plan permits each participant to receivea single sum distribution of his benefit in cash or in the form of theproperty in which such participant's benefit was invested prior to thedistribution. This plan's single sum distribution option provides two optionalforms of benefit. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 10. </T3>A defined benefit plan provides for an early retirementbenefit payable upon termination of employment after attainment of age55 and either after ten years of service or, if earlier, upon plan terminationto employees of Division A and provides for an identical early retirementbenefit payable on the same terms with the exception of payment on plantermination to employees of Division B. The plan provides for two optionalforms of benefit. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 11. </T3>A profit-sharing plan provides for loans secured byan employee's account balance. In the event of default on such a loan,there is an execution on such account balances. Such execution is a distributionof the employee's accrued benefits under the plan. A distribution of anaccrued benefit contingent on default under a plan loan secured by suchaccrued benefits is an optional form of benefit under the plan.</ITAG>(c) <T3>Plan terms_</T3>(1) <T3>General rule. </T3>Generally, benefits described in section 411(d)(6)(A),early retirement benefits, retirement-type subsidies, and optional formsof benefit are section 411(d)(6) protected benefits only if they are providedunder the terms of a plan. However, if an employer establishes a patternof repeated plan amendments providing for similar benefits in similar situationsfor substantially consecutive, limited periods of time, such benefits willbe treated as provided under the terms of the plan, without regard to thelimited periods of time, to the extent necessary to carry out the purposesof section 411(d)(6) and, where applicable, the definitely determinablerequirement of section 401(a), including section 401(a)(25). A patternof repeated plan amendments providing that a particular optional form ofbenefit is available to certain named employees for a limited period oftime is within the scope of this rule and may result in such optional formof benefit being treated as provided under the terms of the plan to allemployees covered under the plan without regard to the limited period oftime and the limited group of named employees. (2) <T3>Effective date. </T3>The provisions of paragraph (c)(1)of this Qandamp;A-1are effective as of July 11, 1988. Thus, patterns or repeated plan amendmentsadopted and effective before July 11, 1988 will be disregarded in determiningwhether such amendments have created an ongoing optional form of benefitunder the plan. (d) <T3>Benefits that are not section 411(d)(6) protected benefits. </T3>thefollowing benefits are examples of items that are not section 411(d)(6)protected benefits: (1) ancillary life insurance protection; (2) accidentor health insurance benefits; (3) social security supplements describedin section 411(a)(9); (4) the availability of loans (other than the distributionof an employee's accrued benefit upon default under a loan); (5) the rightto make after-tax employee contributions or elective deferrals describedin section 402(g)(3); (6) the right to direct investments; (7) the rightto a particular form of investment (e.g., investment in employer stockor securites or investment in certain types of securities, commercial paper,or other investment media); (8) the allocation dates for contributions,forefeitures and earnings, the time for making contributions (but not theconditions for receiving an allocation of contributions or forfeituresfor a plan year after such conditions have been satisfied), and the valuationdates for account balances; (9) administrative procedures for distributingbenefits, such as provisions relating to the particular dates on whichnotices are given and by which election must be made; and (10 rights thatderive from administrative and operational provisions, such as mechanicalprocedures for allocating investment experience among accounts in definedcontribution plans.Q-2: To what extent may section 411(d)(6) protected benefits under a planbe reduced or eliminated? A-2: (a) <T3>Reduction or elimination of section 411(d)(6) protected benefits</T3>_(1)<T3>In general. </T3>A plan may not be amended to eliminate or reduce asection 411(d)(6) protected benefit that has already accrued, except asprovided in sections 412(c)(8) and 4281, and in paragraph (b) of this Qandamp;A-2.This is generally the case even if such elimination or reduction is contingentupon the employee's consent. However, a plan may be amended to eliminateor reduce section 411(d)(6) protected benefits with respect to benefitsnot yet accrued as of the later of the amendment's adoption date or effectivedate without violating section 411(d)(6). (2) <T3>Selection of optional forms of benefit</T3>_(i) <T3>General rule. </T3>A plan may treat a participant as receiving hisentire nonforfeitable accrued benefit under the plan if the participantreceives his benefit in an optional form of benefit in an amount determinedunder the plan that is at least the actuarial equivalent of the employee'snonforfeitable accrued benefit payable at normal retirement age under theplan. This is true even though the participant could have elected to receivean optional form of benefit with a greater actuarial value than the valueof the optional form received, such as an optional form including retirement-typesubsidies, and without regard to whether such other, more valuable optionalform could have commenced immediately or could have become available onlyupon the employee's future satisfaction of specified eligibility conditions.(ii) <T3>Election of an optional form. </T3>Except as provided in paragraph(a)(2)(iii) of this Qandamp;A-2, a plan does not violate section 411(d)(6)merely because an employee's election to receive a portion of his nonforfeitableaccrued benefit in one optional form of benefit precludes the employeefrom receiving that portion of his benefit in another optional form ofbenefit. Such employee retains all 411(d)(6) protected rights with respectto the entire portion of such employee's nonforfeitable accrued benefitfor which no distribution election was made. For purposes of this rule,an elective transfer of an otherwise distributable benefit is treated asthe selection of an optional form of benefit. See Qandamp;A-3 of this section.(iii) <T3>Buy-back rule. </T3>Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this Qandamp;A-2,an employee who received a distribution of his nonforfeitable benefit froma plan that is required to provide a repayment opportunity to such employeeif he returns to service within the applicable period pursuant to the requirementsof section 411(a)(7) and who, upon subsequent reemployment, repays thefull amount of such distribution in accordance with section 411(a)(7)(C)must be reinstated in the full array of section 411(d)(6) protected benefitsthat existed with respect to such benefit prior to distribution. (iv) <T3>Examples. </T3>The rules in this paragraph (a)(2) can be illustratedby the following examples:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 1. </T3>Defined benefit plan X provides, among its optionalforms of benefit, for a subsidized early retirement benefit payable inthe form of an annuity and available to employees who terminate from employmenton or after their 55th birthdays. In addition plan X provides for a singlesum distribution available on termination from employment or terminationof the plan. The single sum distribution is determined on the basis ofthe present value of the accrued normal retirement benefit and does nottake the early retirement subsidy into account. Plan X is terminated December31, 1991. Employees U, age 47, V, age 55, and W, age 47, all continue inthe service of the employer. Employees X, age 47, Y, age 55 and Z, age47, terminate from employment with the employer during 1991. EmployeesU and V elect to take the single sum optional form of distribution at thetime of plan termination. Employees X and Y elect to take the single sumdistribution on termination from employment with the employer. The eliminationof the subsidized early retirement benefit with respect to employees U,V, X and Y does not result in a violation of section 411(d)(6). This isthe result even though employees U and X had not yet satisfied the conditionsfor the subsidized early retirement benefit. Because employees W and Zhave not selected an optional form of benefit, they continue to have a411(d)(6) protected right to the full array of section 411(d)(6) protectedbenefits provided under the plan, including the single sum distributionform and the subsidized early retirement benefit. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 2. </T3>A partially vested employee receives a single sum distributionof the present value of his entire nonforfeitable benefit on account ofseparation from service under a defined benefit plan providing for a repaymentprovision. Upon reemployment with the employer such employee makes repaymentin the required amount in accordance with section 411(a)(7). Such employeemay, upon subsequent termination of employment, elect to take such repaidbenefits in any optional form provided under the plan as of the time ofthe employee's initial separation from service. If the plan was amendedprior to such repayment, to eliminate the single sum optional form of benefitwith respect to benefits accrued after the date of the amendment, suchparticipant has a 411(d)(6) protected right to take distribution of therepaid benefit in the form of a single sum distribution.</ITAG>(3) <T3>Certain transactions</T3>_(i) <T3>Plan mergers and benefit transfers. </T3>The prohibition against thereduction or elimination of section 411(d)(6) protected benefits alreadyaccrued applies to plan mergers, spinoffs, transfers, and transactionsamending or having the effect of amending a plan or plans to transfer planbenefits. Thus, for example, if plan A, a profit-sharing plan that providesfor distribution of plan benefits in annual installments over ten or twentyyears, is merged with plan B, a profit-sharing plan that provides for distributionof plan benefits in annual installments over life expectancy at time ofretirement, the merged plan must retain the ten or twenty year installmentoption for participants with respect to benefits already accrued underplan A as of the merger and the installments over life expectancy for participantswith benefits already accrued under plan B. Similarly, for example, ifan employee's benefit under a defined contribution plan is transferredto another defined contribution plan (whether or not of the same employer),the optional forms of benefit available with respect to the employee'sbenefit accrued under the transferor plan may not be eliminated or reducedexcept as otherwise permitted under this regulation. See Qandamp;A-3 of thissection with respect to the transfer of benefits between and among definedbenefit and defined contribution plans.(ii) <T3>Annuity contracts</T3>_(A) <T3>General rule. </T3>The protection provided by section 411(d)(6) maynot be avoided by the use of annuity contracts. Thus, section 411(d)(6)protected benefits already accrued may not be eliminated or reduced merelybecause a plan uses annuity contracts to provide such benefits, withoutregard to whether the plan, a participant, or a beneficiary of a participantholds the contract or whether such annuity contracts are purchased as aresult of the termination of the plan. However, to the extent that an annuitycontract constitutes payment of benefits in a particular optional formelected by the participant, the plan does not violate section 411(d)(6)merely because it provides that other optional forms are no longer availablewith respect to such participant. See paragraph (a)(2) of this Qandamp;A-2.(B) <T3>Examples. </T3>The provisions of this paragraph (a)(3)(ii) can be illustratedby the following examples:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 1. </T3>A profit-sharing plan that is being terminated satisfiessection 411(d)(6) only if the plan makes available to participants annuitycontracts that provide for all section 411(d)(6) protected benefits underthe plan that may not otherwise be reduced or eliminated pursuant to thisQandamp;A-2. Thus, if such a plan provided for a single sum distributionupon attainment of early retirement age, and a provision for payment inthe form of 10 equal annual installments, the plan would satisfy section411(d)(6) only if the participants had the opportunity to elect to havetheir benefits provided under an annuity contract that provided for thesame single sum distribution upon the attainment of the participant's earlyretirement age and the same 10 year installment optional form of benefit.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 2. </T3>A defined benefit plan permits each participant whoseparates from service on or after age 62 to receive a qualified jointand survivor annuity or a single life annuity commencing 45 days aftertermination from employment. For a participant who separates from servicebefore age 62, payments under these optional forms of benefit commence45 days after the participant's 62nd birthday. Under the plan, a participantis to elect among these optional forms of benefit during the 90-day periodpreceding the annuity starting date. However, during such period, a participantmay defer both benefit commencement and the election of a particular benefitform to any later date, subject to section 401(a)(9). In January 1990,the employer decides to terminate the plan as of July 1, 1990. The planwill fail to satisfy section 411(d)(6) unless the optional forms of benefitprovided under the plan are preserved under the annuity contract purchasedon plan termination. Thus, such annuity contract must provide a participantthe same optional benefit commencement rights that the plan provided. Inaddition, such contract must provide the same election rights with respectto such benefit options. This is the case even if, for example, in conjunctionwith the termination, the employer amended the plan to permit participantsto elect a qualified joint and survivor annuity, single life annuity, orsingle sum distribution commencing on July 1, 1990.</ITAG>(4) <T3>Benefits payable to a spouse or beneficiary. </T3>Section 411(d)(6)protected benefits may not be eliminated merely because they are payablewith respect to a spouse or other beneficiary. (b) <T3>Section 411(d)(6) protected benefits that may be eliminated or reducedonly as permitted by the Commissioner</T3>_(1) <T3>In general. </T3>The Commissioner may, consistent with the provisionsof this section, provide for the elimination or reduction of section 411(d)(6)protected benefits that have already accrued only to the extent that suchelimination or reduction does not result in the loss to plan participantsof either a valuable right or an employer-subsidized optional form of benefitwhere a similar optional form of benefit with a comparable subsidy is notprovided or to the extent such elimination or reduction is necessary topermit compliance with other requirements of section 401(a) (e.g., sections401(a)(4), 401(a)(9) and 415). The Commissioner may exercise this authorityonly through the publication of revenue rulings, notices, and other documentsof general applicability. (2) <T3>Section 411(d)(6) protected benefits that may be eliminated or reduced.</T3>The elimination or reduction of certain section 411(d)(6) protectedbenefits that have already accrued in the following situations does notviolate section 411(d)(6). The rules with respect to permissible eliminationsand reductions provided in this paragraph (b)(2) are effective January30, 1986. These exceptions create no inference with respect to whetherany other applicable requirements are satisfied (for example, requirementsimposed by section 401(a)(9) and section 401(a)(14)).(i) <T3>Change in statutory requirement.</T3> A plan may be amended to eliminateor reduce a section 411(d)(6) protected benefit if the following threerequirements are met: the amendment constitutes timely compliance witha change in law affecting plan qualification; there is an exercise of section7805(b) relief by the Commissioner; and the elimination or reduction ismade only to the extent necessary to enable the plan to continue to satisfythe requirements for qualified plans. In general, the elimination or reductionof a section 411(d)(6) protected benefit will not be treated as necessaryif it is possible through other modifications to the plan (e.g., by expandingthe availability of an optional form of benefit to additional employees)to satisfy the applicable qualification requirement.(ii) <T3>Joint and survivor annuity.</T3> A plan that provides a range of threeor more actuarially equivalent joint and survivor annuity options may beamended to eliminate any of such options, other than the options with thelargest and smallest optional survivor payment percentages, even if theeffect of such amendment is to change which of the options is the qualifiedjoint and survivor annuity under section 417. Thus, for example, if a moneypurchase pension plan provides three joint and survivor annuity optionswith survivor payments of 50%, 75% and 100%, respectively, that are uniformwith respect to age and are actuarially equivalent, then the employer mayeliminate the option with the 75% survivor payment, even if this optionhad been the qualified joint and survivor annuity under the plan.(iii) <T3>In-kind distributions after plan termination</T3>_(A) <T3>In general.</T3> If a plan includes an optional form of benefit underwhich benefits are distributed in specified property (other than cash),such optional form of benefit may be modified for distributions after plantermination by substituting cash for the specified property to the extentthat, on plan termination, an employee has the opportunity to receive theoptional form of benefit in the specified property. This exception is notavailable, however, if the employer that maintains the terminating planalso maintains another plan that provides an optional form of benefit inthe specified property.(B) <T3>Example.</T3> This paragraph (b)(2)(iii) can be illustrated by thefollowing example:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example.</T3> An employer maintains a stock bonus plan under whicha participant, upon termination from employment, may elect to receive hisbenefits in a single sum distribution in employer stock. This is the onlyplan maintained by the employer under which distributions in employer stockare available. The employer decides to terminate the stock bonus plan.If such plan is amended to make available a single sum distribution inemployer stock on plan termination, the plan will not fail section 411(d)(6)solely because the optional form of benefit providing a single sum distributionin employer stock on termination from employment is modified to providethat such distribution is available only in cash.</ITAG>(iv) <T3>Coordination with diversification requirement.</T3> A tax credit employeestock ownership plan (as defined in section 409(a)) or an employee stockownership plan (as defined in section 4975(e)(7)) may be amended to providethat a distribution is not available in employer securities to the extentthat an employee elects to diversify benefits pursuant to section 401(a)(28).(v) <T3>Involuntary distributions.</T3> A plan may be amended to provide forthe involuntary distribution of an employee's benefit to the extent suchinvoluntary distribution is permitted under sections 411(a)(11) and 417(e).Thus, for example, an involuntary distribution provision may be amendedto require that an employee who terminates from employment with the employerreceive a single sum distribution in the event that the present value ofthe employee's benefit is not more than $1,750, by substituting $3,500for $1,750, without violating section 411(d)(6). In addition, for example,the employer may amend the plan to reduce the involuntary distributionthreshold from $3,500 to any lower amount and to eliminate the involuntarysingle sum option for employees with benefits between $3,500 and such loweramount without violating section 411(d)(6). This rule does not permit aplan provision permitting employer discretion with respect to optionalforms of benefit for employees the present value of whose benefit is lessthan $3,500.(vi) <T3>Distribution exception for certain profit-sharing plans</T3>_(A) <T3>In general.</T3> If a defined contribution plan that is not subjectto section 412 and does not provide for an annuity option is terminated,the plan may be amended to provide for the distribution of a participant'saccrued benefit upon termination in a single sum optional form withoutthe participant's consent. The preceding sentence does not apply if theemployer maintains any other defined contribution plan (other than an employeestock ownership plan as defined in section 4975(e)(7)).(B) <T3>Examples.</T3> The provisions of this paragraph (b)(2)(vi) can be illustratedby the following examples:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 1.</T3> Employer X maintains a defined contribution plan thatis not subject to section 412. The plan provides for distribution in theform of equal installments over five years or equal installments over twentyyears. X maintains no other defined contribution plans. X terminates itsdefined contribution plan after amending the plan to provide for the distributionof all participants' accrued benefits in the form of single sum distributions,without obtaining participant consent. Pursuant to the rule in this paragraph(b)(2)(iv), this amendment does not violate the requirements of section411(d)(6).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example 2.</T3> Corporations X and Y are members of controlled groupemployer XY. Both X and Y maintain defined contribution plans. X's plan,which is not subject to section 412, covers only employees working forX. Y's plan, which is subject to section 412, covers only employees workingfor Y. X terminates its defined contribution plan. Because employer XYmaintains another defined contribution plan, plan X may not provide forthe distribution of participants' accrued benefits upon termination withouta participants' consent.</ITAG>(vii) <T3>Distribution of benefits on default of loans.</T3> Notwithstandingthat the distribution of benefits arising from an execution on an accountbalance used to secure a loan on which there has been a default is an optionalform of benefit, a plan may be amended to eliminate or change a provisionfor loans, even if such loans would be secured by an employee's accountbalance.(viii) <T3>Provisions for transfer of benefits between and among defined contributionplans and defined benefit plans of the employer.</T3> A plan may be amendedto eliminate provisions permitting the transfer of benefits between andamong defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans of the employer.(ix) <T3>De minimis change in the timing of an optional form of benefit.</T3>A plan may be amended to modify an optional form of benefit by changingthe timing of the availability of such optional form if, after the change,the optional form is available at a time that is within two months of thetime such optional form was available before the amendment. To the extentthe optional form of benefit is available prior to termination of employment,six months may be substituted for two months in the prior sentence. Thus,for example, a plan that makes in-service distributions available to employeesonce every month may be amended to make such in-service distributions availableonly once every six months. This exception to section 411(d)(6) relatesonly to the timing of the availability of the optional form of benefit.Other aspects of an optional form of benefit may not be modified and thevalue of such optional form may not be reduced merely because of an amendmentpermitted by this exception.(c) <T3>Serial amendments.</T3> A plan amendment that modifies an optionalform of benefit with respect to benefits already accrued will be evaluatedin light of previous amendments. Thus, for example, amendments made atdifferent times that, when taken together, constitute the elimination orreduction of a valuable right, will be treated as the impermissible eliminationor reduction of an optional form of benefit even though each amendment,considered alone, may otherwise be permissible.(d) <T3>ESOP and stock bonus plan exception</T3>_(1) <T3>In general.</T3> Subject to the limitations in paragraph (d)(2) ofthis Qandamp;A-5, a tax credit employee stock ownership plan (as definedin section 409(a)) or an employee stock ownership plan (as defined in section4975(e)(7)) will not be treated as violating the requirements of section411(d)(6) merely because of any of the circumstances described in paragraphs(d)(1)(i) through (d)(1)(iv) of this Qandamp;A-2. In addition, a stock bonusplan that is not an employee stock ownership plan will not be treated asviolating the requirements of section 411(d)(6) merely because of any ofthe circumstances described in paragraphs (d)(1)(ii) and (d)(1)(iv) ofthis Qandamp;A-2.(i) <T3>Single sum or installment optional forms of benefit.</T3> The employereliminates, or retains the discretion to eliminate, with respect to allparticipants, a single sum optional form or installment optional form withrespect to benefits that are subject to section 409(h)(1)(B), providedsuch elimination or retention of discretion is consistent with the distributionand payment requirements otherwise applicable to such plans (e.g., thoserequired by section 409).(ii) <T3>Employer becomes substantially employee-owned.</T3> The employer eliminates,or retains the discretion to eliminate, with respect to all participants,in cases in which the employer becomes substantially employee-owned, optionalforms of benefit by substituting cash distributions for distributions inthe form of employer stock with respect to benefits subject to section409(h). This exception is available only if the employer otherwise meetsthe requirements of section 409(h)(2) with respect to restrictions on theownership of outstanding employer stock.(iii) <T3>Employer securities become readily tradable.</T3> The employer eliminates,or retains the discretion to eliminate, with respect to all participants,in cases in which the employer securities become readily tradable, optionalforms of benefit by substituting distributions in the form of employersecurities for distributions in cash with respect to benefits that aresubject to section 409(h).(iv) <T3>Employer securities cease to be readily tradable or certain sales.</T3>The employer eliminates, or retains the discretion to eliminate, with respectto all participants, optional forms of benefit by substituting cash distributionsfor distributions in the form of employer stock with respect to benefitsthat are subject to section 409(h) in the following circumstances:(A) The employer stock ceases to be readily tradable;(B) The employer stock continues to be readily tradable but there is asale of substantially all of the stock of the employer or a sale of substantiallyall of the assets of a trade or business of the employer and, in eithersituation, the purchasing employer continues to maintain the plan.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">In the situation described in paragraph (d)(1)(iv)(B) of this Qandamp;A-2,the employer may also substitute distributions in the purchasing employer'sstock for distributions in the form of employer stock of the predecessoremployer.(2) <T3>Limitations on ESOP and stock bonus plan exceptions_</T3>(i) <T3>Nondiscrimination requirement.</T3> Plan amendments and the retentionand exercise of discretion permitted under the exceptions in paragraph(d)(1) must meet the nondiscrimination requirements of section 401(a)(4).(ii) <T3>ESOP investment requirement.</T3> Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(iii)of this Qandamp;A-2, benefits provided by employee stock ownership planswill not be eligible for the exceptions in paragraph (d)(1) of this Qandamp;A-2unless the benefits have been held in a tax credit employee stock ownershipplan (as defined in section 409(a)) or an employee stock ownership plan(as defined in section 4975(e)(7)) subject to section 409(h) for the five-yearperiod prior to the exercise of employer discretion or any amendment affectingsuch benefits and permitted under paragraph (d)(1) of this Qandamp;A-2. Forpurposes of the preceding sentence, if benefits held under an employeestock ownership plan are transferred to a plan that is an employee stockownership plan at the time of the transfer, then the consecutive periodsunder the transferor and transferee employee stock ownership plans maybe aggregated for purposes of meeting the five-year requirement. If thebenefits are held in an employer stock ownership plan throughout the entireperiod of their existence, and such total period of existence is less thanfive years, then such lesser period may be substituted for the five yearrequirement.(3) <T3>Effective date.</T3> The provisions of this paragraph (d) are effectivebeginning with the first day of the first plan year commencing on or afterJanuary 1, 1989. Prior to this effective date the reduction or eliminationof a section 411(d)(6) protected benefit by a tax credit employee stockownership plan (as defined in section 409(a)) or an employee stock ownershipplan (as defined in section 4975(e)(7)) will not be treated as violatingthe requirements of section 411(d)(6) if such reduction or eliminationreflects a reasonable interpretation of the statutory language of section411(d)(6)(C).(4) <T3>Additional exceptions and requirements.</T3> The Commissioner may,in revenue rulings, notices or other documents of general applicability,prescribe such additional rules and exceptions, consistent with the purposesof this section, as may be necessary or appropriate.Q-3 Does the transfer of benefits between and among defined benefit plansand defined contribution plans (or similar transactions) violate the requirementsof section 411(d)(6)?A-3 (a) <T3>Transfers and similar transactions_</T3>(1) <T3>General rule. </T3>Section 411(d)(6) protected benefits may not beeliminated by reason of transfer or any transaction amending or havingthe effect of amending a plan or plans to transfer benefits. Thus, forexample, except as otherwise provided in this section, an employer whomaintains a money purchase pension plan that provides for a single sumoptional form of benefit may not establish another plan that does not providefor this optional form of benefit and transfer participants' account balancesto such new plan. (2) <T3>Defined benefit feature and separate account feature. </T3>The definedbenefit feature of an employee's benefit under a defined benefit plan andthe separate account feature of an employee's benefit under a defined contributionplan are section 411(d)(6) protected benefits. Thus, for example, the eliminationof the defined benefit feature of an employee's benefit under a definedbenefit plan, through transfer of benefits from a defined benefit planto a defined contribution plan or plans, will violate section 411(d)(6).(3) <T3>Waiver prohibition. </T3>In general, an employee may not elect to waivesection 411(d)(6) protected benefits. Thus, for example, the eliminationof the defined benefit feature of an employee's benefit under a definedplan by reason of a transfer of such benefits to a defined contributionplan pursuant to an employee election, at a time when the benefit is notdistributable to the employee, violates section 411(d)(6). (b) <T3>Elective transfers of benefits between plans</T3>_(1) <T3>Elective transfer. </T3>A transfer of a participant's benefits betweenqualified plans that results in the elimination or reduction of section411(d)(6) protected benefits does not violate section 411(d)(6) if thetransfer meets the requirements of section 411(l) and the following requirementsare met: (i) <T3>Voluntary election</T3>_(A) <T3>Participant election. </T3>The plan from which the benefits are transferredmust provide that the transfer is conditioned upon a voluntary, fully informedelection by the participant to transfer such participant's benefit to anotherplan maintained by the employer. (B) <T3>Benefit retention alternative. </T3>In making the voluntary electionprovided for in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A) of this Qandamp;A-3, the participantmust have an alternative that retains such employee's section 411(d)(6)protected benefits (including all optional forms of benefit) under theplan. Thus, either of the following two requirements must be met: (<T3>1</T3>) If the plan from which the benefits are transferred is terminating,the terminating plan must satisfy the requirements of section 401(a)(2)and section 411(d)(6), or (<T3>2</T3>) If the plan from which the benefits are transferred is notterminating, the participant must be given the option of leaving his benefitin the ongoing plan to the extent required by section 411(a)(11) and section417(e); (C) <T3>Spousal election. </T3>If sections 401(a)(11) and 417 apply to theplan from which the benefits are transferred, the spousal consent requirementsof such section must be met with respect to the transfer of benefits. (D) <T3>Notice requirement. </T3>The notice requirements under section 417,requiring a written explanation with respect to an election not to receivebenefits in the form of a qualified joint and survivor annuity, must bemet with respect to the participant and spousal transfer election. (ii) <T3>Distributability of benefits. </T3>The participant whose benefits aretransferred must be eligible, under the terms of the plan from which thebenefits are transferred, to receive an immediate distribution from suchplan under provisions in the plan not inconsistent with section 401(a).(iii) <T3>Amount of benefit transferred. </T3>The amount of the benefit transferredmust equal the entire nonforfeitable accrued benefit under the plan ofthe participant whose benefit is being transferred, calculated to be atleast the greater of the single sum distribution provided for under theplan for which the participant is eligible (if any) or the present valueof the participant's accrued payable at normal retirement age and calculatedby using an interest rate subject to the restrictions of section 417(e)and subject to the overall limitations imposed by section 415. (iv) <T3>Benefit under the transferee plan.</T3> The participant must be fullyvested in the transferred benefit in the transferee plan. In a transferfrom a defined contribution plan to a defined benefit plan, the definedbenefit plan must provide a minimum benefit, for each participant whosebenefits are transferred, equal to the benefit, expressed as an annuitypayable at normal retirement age, that is derived solely on the basis ofthe amount transferred with respect to such participant. (2) <T3>Status of elective transfer as distribution.</T3> The transfer of benefitspursuant to the elective transfer rules of this paragraph (b) generallyis to be treated as a distribution of a participant's accrued benefit undera plan for purposes of section 401(a). For example, a transfer option isan optional form of benefit under section 411(d)(6); the availability ofsuch optional form of benefit is subject to the nondiscrimination requirementsof section 401(a)(4); and the transfer is treated as a distribution subjectto the cash-out rules in section 411(a)(7), the early termination requirementsof section 411(d)(2) and the requirements of sections 401(a)(11) and 417.However, the transfer is not treated as a distribution for purposes ofthe minimum distribution requirements of section 401(a)(9). (3) <T3>Effective date.</T3> The rules with respect to transfers are generallyeffective January 30, 1986. However, with respect to transfers from definedbenefit plans to defined contribution plans and from defined contributionplans to defined benefit plans, the rules of this paragraph (b) are effectivebeginning August 10, 1988. On or after January 30, 1986, and prior to August10, 1988 the transitional rules provided in paragraph (c) of this Qandamp;A-3are effective with respect to such transfers. (c) <T3>Transitional rule. </T3>Prior to the effective date in paragraph (b)(3)of this Qandamp;A-3, the transfer of benefits from a defined contributionplan to a defined benefit plan, or a defined benefit plan to a definedcontribution plan, does not violate section 411(d)(6) solely by reasonof the elimination of section 411(d)(6) protected benefits, if the benefitstransferred were distributable under the plan or could have been distributableunder section 401(a) and either of the following requirements are met:(1) <T3>Transfer exception.</T3> The transfer satisfies the rules in paragraph(b) of this Qandamp;A-3, or (2) <T3>Direct transfer.</T3> The plan to which the benefits are to be transferredprovides, or is amended to provide, for all section 411(d)(6) protectedbenefits provided under the transferor plan with respect to the benefitstransferred (with the sole exception of the defined benefit feature ofthe benefit under a defined benefit plan and the defined contribution featureunder a defined contribution plan); the transferred benefits are treatedas held under a transferee plan for purposes of the requirements of sections401(a)(11) and 417; the transferred amounts meet the requirements of section414(l) with respect to the transfer of assets and liabilities, and thebenefits transferred do not exceed the limitations imposed by section 415.Amendments required for purposes of satisfying this rule must be made bythe date for making any amendments required for purposes of conformingthe plan to the requirements of section 410(b) as amended by TRA '86. However,plans covered by this rule must comply with these requirements in operationand any required amendments must be retroactive to the date on which thebenefits were transferred. (d) <T3>Examples.</T3> If a transfer complying with the elective transfer rulesof paragraph (b) of this Qandamp;A-3 is made from a defined benefit planto a profit-sharing plan that does not provide for a life annuity distributionform, the profit-sharing plan to which the benefits are transferred wouldnot be required to provide for a qualified joint and survivor annuity withrespect to the transferred benefits. If the same transfer is made underthe direct transfer transitional rule of paragraph (c)(2) of this Qandamp;A-3,the defined contribution plan is treated as a transferee plan with respectto the transferred benefits for purposes of the requirements of section401(a)(11) and section 417. Thus, for example, if such benefits are transferredwithout spousal consent to a profit-sharing plan that did not previouslyprovide for a life annuity distribution form, such plan would be requiredto provide for a qualified joint and survivor annuity for the participantswhose benefits were transferred with respect to the transferred benefits.Q-4: May a plan provide that the employer may, through the exercise ofdiscretion, deny a participant a section 411(d)(6) protected benefit forwhich the participant is otherwise eligible?A-4: (a) <T3>In general. </T3>Except as provided in paragraph (d) of Qandamp;A-2 ofthis section with respect to certain employee stock ownership plans, aplan that permits the employer, either directly or indirectly, throughthe exercise of discretion, to deny a participant a section 411(d)(6) protectedbenefit provided under the plan for which the participant is otherwiseeligible (but for the employer's exercise of discretion) violates the requirementsof section 411(d)(6). A plan provision that makes a section 411(d)(6) protectedbenefit available only to those employees as the employer may designateis within the scope of this prohibition. Thus, for example, a plan provisionunder which only employees who are designated by the employer are eligibleto receive a subsidized early retirement benefit constitutes an impermissibleprovision under section 411(d)(6). In addition, a pension plan that permitsemployer discretion to deny the availability of a section 411(d)(6) protectedbenefit violates the definitely determinable requirement of section 401(a),including section 401(a)(25). See andSection; 1.401-1(b)(1)(i). This is theresult even if the plan specifically limits the employer's discretion tochoosing among section 411(d)(6) protected benefits, including optionalforms of benefit, that are actuarially equivalent. In addition, the provisionsof sections 411(a)(11) and 417(e) that allow a plan to make involuntarydistributions of certain amounts are not excepted from this limitationon employer discretion. Thus, for example, a plan may not permit employerdiscretion with respect to whether benefits will be distributed involuntarilyin the event that the present value of the employee's benefit is not morethan $3,500 within the meaning of sections 411(a)(11) and 417(e). (An exceptionis provided for such provisions with respect to the nondiscrimination requirementsof section 401(a)(4). See andSection; 1.401(a)-4 Qandamp;A-4.)(b) <T3>Exception for administrative discretion. </T3>A plan may permit limiteddiscretion with respect to the ministerial or mechanical administrationof the plan, including the application of objective plan criteria specificallyset forth in the plan. Such plan provisions do not violate the requirementsof section 411(d)(6) or the definitely determinable requirement of section401(a), including section 401(a)(25). For example, these requirements arenot violated by the following provisions that permit limited administrativediscretion:(1) Commencement of benefit payments as soon as administratively feasibleafter a stated date or event;(2) Employer authority to determine whether objective criteria specifiedin the plan (e.g., objective criteria designed to identify those employeeswith a heavy and immediate financial need or objective criteria designedto determine whether an employee has a permanent and total disability)have been satisfied; and(3) Employer authority to determine, pursuant to specific guidelines setforth in the plan, whether the participant or spouse is dead or cannotbe located.Q-5: When will the exercise of discretion by some person or persons, otherthan the employer, be treated as employer discretion?A-5: For purposes of applying the rules of this section and andSection; 1.401(a)-4,the term ``employer'' includes plan administrator, fiduciary, trustee,actuary, independent third party, and other persons. Thus, if a plan permitsany person, other than the participant (and other than the participant'sspouse), the discretion to deny or limit the availability of a section411(d)(6) protected benefit for which the employee is otherwise eligibleunder the plan (but for the exercise of such discretion), such plan violatesthe requirements of sections 401(a), including section 411(d)(6) and, whereapplicable, the definitely determinable requirement of section 401(a),including section 401(a)(25).Q-6: May a plan condition the availability of a section 411(d)(6) protectedbenefit on the satisfaction of objective conditions that are specificallyset forth in the plan?A-6: (a) <T3>Certain objective conditions permissible</T3>_(1) <T3>In general. </T3>The availability of a section 411(d)(6) protectedbenefit may be limited to employees who satisfy certain objective conditionsprovided the conditions are ascertainable, clearly set forth in the planand not subject to the employer's discretion except to the extent reasonablynecessary to determine whether the objective conditions have been met.Also, the availability of the section 411(d)(6) protected benefit mustmeet the nondiscrimination requirements of section 401(a)(4). See andSection;1.401(a)-4.(2) <T3>Examples of permissible conditions. </T3>The following examples illustrateof permissible objective conditions: a plan may deny a single sum distributionform to employees for whom life insurance is not available at standardrates as defined under the terms of the plan at the time the single sumdistribution would otherwise be payable; a plan may provide that a singlesum distribution is available only if the employee is in extreme financialneed as defined under the terms of the plan at the time the single sumdistribution would otherwise be payable; a plan my condition the availabilityof a single sum distribution on the execution of a covenant not to compete,provided that objective conditions with respect to the terms of such covenantand the employees and circumstances requiring execution of such covenantare set forth in the plan.(b) <T3>Conditions based on factors within employer's discretion generallyimpermissible. </T3>A plan may not limit the availability of section 411(d)(6)protected benefits permitted under the plan on objective conditions thatare within the employer's discretion. For example, the availability ofsection 411(d)(6) protected benefits in a plan may not be conditioned ona determination with respect to the level of the plan's funded status,because the amount of plan funding is within the employer's discretion.However, for example, although conditions based on the plan's funded statusare impermissible, a plan may limit the availability of a section 411(d)(6)protected benefit (e.g., a single sum distribution) in an objective manner,such as the following:(1) Single sum distributions of $25,000 and less are available withoutlimit; and(2) Single sum distributions in excess of $25,000 are available for a yearonly to the extent that the total amount of such single sum distributionsfor the year is not greater than $5,000,000; and (3) An objective and nondiscriminatory method for determining which particularsingle sum distributions will not be available during a year in order forthe $5,000,000 limit to be satisfied is set forth in the plan.Q-7: May a plan be amended to add employer discretion or conditions restrictingthe availability of a section 411(d)(6) protected benefit?A-7: No. The addition of employer discretion or objective conditions withrespect to a section 411(d)(6) protected benefit that has already accruedviolates section 411(d)(6). Also, the addition of conditions (whether ornot objective) or any change to existing conditions with respect to section411(d)(6) protected benefits that results in any further restriction violatessection 411(d)(6). However, the addition of objective conditions to a section411(d)(6) protected benefit may be made with respect to benefits accruedafter the later of the adoption or effective date of the amendment. Inaddition, objective conditions may be imposed on section 411(d)(6) protectedbenefits accrued as of the date of an amendment where permitted under thetransitional rules of andSection; 1.401(a)-4 Qandamp;A-5 and Qandamp;A-8 of thissection. Finally, objective conditions may be imposed on section 411(d)(6)protected benefits to the extent permitted by the permissible benefit cutbackprovisions of Qandamp;A-2 of this section.Q-8: If a plan contains an impermissible employer discretion provisionwith respect to a section 411(d)(6) protected benefit, what acceptablealternative exist for amending the plan without violating the requirementsof section 411(d)(6)?A-8: (a) <T3>In general. </T3>The following rules apply for purposes of making necessaryamendments to existing plans (as defined in Qandamp;A-9 of this section)that contain discretion provisions with respect to the availability ofsection 411(d)(6) protected benefits that violate the requirements of section401(a), including sections 401(a)(25) and 411(d)(6), and this section.These transitional rules are provided under the authority of section 411(d)(6)and section 7805(b).(b) <T3>Transitional alternatives. </T3>If the availability of an optionalforms of benefit, early or late retirement benefit, or retirement-typesubsidy under an existing plan is conditioned on the exercise of employerdiscretion, the plan must be amended either to eliminate the optional formof benefit, early or late retirement benefit, or retirement-type subsidyto make such benefit available to all participants without limitation,or to apply objective and nondiscriminatory conditions to the availabilityof the optional form of benefit, early or later retirement benefit, orretirement-type subsidy. See paragraph (d) of this Qandamp;A-8 for ruleslimiting the period during which section 411(d)(6) protected benefits maybe eliminated or reduced under this paragraph.(c) <T3>Compliance and amendment date provisions</T3>_(1) <T3>Operational compliance requirement</T3>. On or before the applicableeffective date for the plan (as determined under Qandamp;A-9 of this section),the plan sponsor must select one of the alternatives permitted under paragraph(b) of the Qandamp;A-8 with respect to each affected section 411(d)(6) protectedbenefit and the plan must be operated in accordance with this selection.This is an operational requirement and does not require a plan amendmentprior to the period set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this Qandamp;A-8. Thereare no special reporting requirements under the Code or this section withrespect to this selection. (2) <T3>Deferred amendment date. </T3>If paragraph (c)(1) of this Qandamp;A-8is satisfied, a plan amendment conforming the plan to the particular alternativeselected under paragraph (b) of this Qandamp;A-8 must be adopted within thetime period permitted for amending plans in order to meet the requirementsof section 410(b) as amended by TRA '86. The plan amendment to conformthe plan to these regulations may be made at an earlier date. Such conformingamendment must be consistent with the sponsor's selection as reflectedby plan practice during the period from the effective date to the datethe amendment is adopted. Thus, for example, if any existing calendar yearnoncollectively bargained defined benefit plan has a single sum distributionoption that is subject to employer discretion as of August 1, 1986, andsuch employer makes one or more single sum distributions available on orafter January 1, 1989 and before the effective date by which plan amendmentis required pursuant to this section, then such employer may not adopta plan amendment eliminating the single sum distribution, but rather mustadopt an amendment eliminating the discretion provision. Any objectiveconditions that are adopted as part of such amendment must not be inconsistentwith the plan practice for the applicable period prior to the amendment.A conforming amendment under this paragraph (c)(2) must be made with respectto each section 411(d)(6) protected benefit for which such amendment isrequired and must be retroactive to the applicable effective date. (d) <T3>Limitation on transitional alternatives. </T3>The transitional alternativespermitting the elimination or reduction of section 411(d)(6) protectedbenefits are only permissible until the applicable effective date for theplan (see Qandamp;A-9 of this section). After the applicable effective date,any amendment (other than one permitted under paragraph (c)(2) of thisQandamp;A-8) that eliminates or reduces a section 411(d)(6) protected benefitor imposes new objective conditions on the availability of such benefitwill fail to qualify for the exception to section 411(d)(6) provided inthis Qandamp;A-8. This is the case without regard to whether the section411(d)(6) protected benefit is subject to employer discretion. Q-9: What are the applicable effective date rules for purposes of thissection?A-9: (a) <T3>General effective date</T3>. Except as otherwise provided in this section,the provisions of this section are effective January 30, 1986. (b) <T3>New plans</T3>_(1)<T3> In general</T3>. Unless otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(2) ofthis Qandamp;A-9, plans that are either adopted or made effective on or afterAugust 1, 1986, are ``new plans''. With respect to such new plans, thissection is effective August 1, 1986. This effective date is applicableto such plans whether or not they are collectively bargained. (2) <T3>Exception with respect to certain new plans. </T3>Plans that are newplans as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this Qandamp;A-9; under which theavailability of a section 411(d)(6) protected benefit is subject to employerdiscretion; and that receive a favorable determination letter that coveredsuch plan provisions with respect to an application submitted prior toJuly 11, 1988, will be treated as existing plans with respect to such section411(d)(6) protected benefit for purposes of the transitional rules of thissection. Thus, such plans are eligible for the compliance and amendmentalternatives set forth in the transitional rule in Qandamp;A-8 of this section.(c) <T3>Existing plans</T3>_(1) <T3>In general</T3>. Plans, including plans that are adoptions of masteror prototype plans, that are both adopted and in effect prior to August1, 1986, are ``existing plans'' for purposes of this section. In addition,a plan that is established after July 31, 1986, but before January 1, 1989,as an initial adoption of a master or prototype plan for which a favorableopinion letter was issued by the Service after July 18, 1985 and beforeJanuary 1, 1989, will be deemed to be an existing plan for purposes ofthis section. See sections 4.01 and 4.02 of Rev. Proc. 84-23, 1984-1 C.B.457, 459, for the definitions of master prototype plans. However, if suchplan ceases to be covered under an opinion letter of the type describedabove, as a result of amendment of the plan or adoption of a new plan,prior to the first day of the first plan year beginning on or after January1, 1989, then the effective date for such plan will be determined as thoughthe plan were a new plan initially adopted as of the date of such amendmentor adoption of a new plan. Finally, new plans described in paragraph (b)(2)of this Qandamp;A-9 are treated as existing plans with respect to certainsection 411(d)(6) protected benefits. Subject to the limitations in paragraph(c) of this Qandamp;A-9, the effective dates set forth in paragraphs (c)(2),(c)(3), and (c)(4) of this Qandamp;A-9 apply to these existing plans forpurposes of this section: (2) <T3>Existing noncollectively bargained plans. </T3>With respect to existingplans other than collectively bargained plans this section is effectivefor the first day of the first plan year commencing on or after January1, 1989.(3) <T3>Existing collectively bargained plans. </T3>With respect to existingcollectively bargained plans this section is effective for the later ofthe first day of the first plan year commencing on or after January 1,1989, or the first day of the first plan year that the requirements ofsection 410(b) as amended by TRA '86 apply to such plan.(4) <T3>Existing master and prototype plans. </T3>With respect to existingplans that are adoptions of master or prototype plans the effective datewill be the first day of the first plan year commencing on or after January1, 1989.(d) <T3>Delayed effective date not applicable to new alternatives or conditions_</T3>(1)<T3>In general. </T3>The delayed effective dates in paragraphs (c)(2) and(c)(3) of this Qandamp;A-9 for existing plans are only applicable with respectto a section 411(d)(6) protected benefit if both the section 411(d)(6)protected benefit and the condition providing employer discretion as tothe availability of such benefit are both adopted and in effect prior toAugust 1, 1986. If the preceding sentence is not satisfied with respectto a particular section 411(d)(6) protected benefit, this section is effectivewith respect to such section 411(d)(6) protected benefit as if the planwere a new plan.(2) <T3>Addition of discretion on or after January 30, 1986. </T3>The delayedeffective dates in paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this Qandamp;A-9 are notavailable with respect to any section 411(d)(6) protected benefit if thesection 411(d)(6) protected benefit was provided for in the plan priorto January 30, 1986, and the availability of such benefit was made subjectto the exercise of employer discretion on or after January 30, 1986. Ifthe conditions set forth in this paragraph are not satisfied with respectto a particular section 411(d)(6) protected benefit, this section is effectivewith respect to such section 411(d)(6) protected benefit as if the planwere a new plan. A limited exception is provided with respect to existingplans that provided a particular section 411(d)(6) protected benefit priorto January 30, 1986, and then amended the plan after January 30, 1986,and before August 1, 1986, to add a provision for employer discretion withrespect to the availability of such benefit. Such plans are required tohave been amended retroactively by December 31, 1987, to remove such provisionfor employer discretion, and, if the benefit made subject to such discretionwas subsequently eliminated, the plan is required to have been furtheramended, by the same date, to retroactively reinstate the benefit.(3) <T3>Exception for certain amendments covered by a favorable determinationletter. </T3>If an amendment adding a section 411(d)(6) protected benefitsubject to employer discretion was adopted or made effective after August1, 1986, and the plan receives a favorable determination letter coveringsuch provision with respect to an application for such letter made priorto July 11, 1988, then the effective date for purposes of amending suchprovision under the transitional rules is the applicable effective datedetermined under the rules with respect to existing plans.(e) <T3>Transitional rule effective date. </T3>The transitional rule providedin Qandamp;A-8 of this section is effective January 30, 1986.<ITAG tagnum="6">Lawrence B.
