To a flurry of publicity in the West and protest even from theEast bloc, playwright Vaclav Havel was arrested Jan. 16 andsubsequently sentenced to eight months in jail.   At least seven leading activists who are less known abroad butimportant in the emerging, younger dissident groups at home havealso been jailed.   Dozens of other critical voices have been muted by whatdissidents term not only the most sweeping crackdown in a decadebut a skillful, carefully targeted repression.   Last year, it appeared to other activists that the authoritieshad at last loosened up on Charter 77, Eastern Europe's oldesthuman rights movement, and were prepared to tolerate a measure ofmore active dissent.   Leading activists such as Havel and fellow Chartist JiriDienstbier and Jiri Ruml began publishing Lidove Noviny (People'sNews), an underground monthly they estimated quickly gained areadership of 4,000 and even seemed a candidate for legalregistration.   A year later, those hopes are dashed.   Underground journals, starved of equipment and money, cannotreach more than a few thousand readers, making activists dependenton foreign radio stations _ widely listened to in Czechoslovakia _to spread their news.   ``Our great problem is the problem of information,'' saidCharter 77 signatory Ladislav Lis. The situation has worsened, henoted, with the passage of new laws this month imposing stiff finesor jail terms on anyone circulating any documents deemedanti-Communist.   Dissidents see various factors behind the change of tactics bythe authorities.   One is that the Vienna conference reviewing implementation ofthe 1975 Helsinki Final Act has ended. At that forum,Czechoslovakia found itself under fire for repression of knowndissidents.   Now, the authorities assure Western diplomats they willimplement the Vienna accords _ they appear willing, for instance,to make it easier for millions of citizens to travel to the West _but are not giving rein to groups they view as anti-Communistenemies.   Probably the biggest factor in the changed tactics is theresponse to mass anti-government protests that occurred in August,October and January.   Prague, a charming city of winding alleys, towers and steeples,is the only capital in Europe where riot police appeared on thestreets six times in five months, using tear gas, batons, dogs,water cannon and even armored personnel carriers to dispersepeaceful crowds.   Thousands of intellectuals signed at least three differentpetitions to the government protesting the police actions and thedetention of Havel and other dissidents.   The crackdown on known dissenters since has signaled theauthorities' determination not to allow Charter 77 a voice inpolitics.   Instead, an official committee was created in December tomonitor human rights. Two officials, Vladimir Flegel and ZbynekVokrouhlicky, said in an interview they have already solved 65cases where citizens previously were refused permission to travelabroad.   But the committee has not spoken out against the policebrutality in January and against toughened penalties on violatingpublic order, an indication of authorities' desire to maintaincontrol over political and social activity.   Yet change could be in the offing.   There have been few if any reprisals against the intellectualswho signed the petitions, an indication that at least some of thecountry's Communist leaders realize they cannot isolate the brainsthey need to revitalize an increasingly stagnant economy.   A well-informed source who asked not to be identified reportedthat at a meeting in mid-March, senior party leaders and economistsdiscussed a plan to open the economy and allow some politicalliberalization.   The plan _ the work of economist Valtr Komarek, who drewattention late last year with highly critical analyses of theCzechoslovak economy _ was rejected when first put to party leaderslast December.   Now, the source reported, it appears to have at least partialsupport from party leader Milos Jakes, who Western diplomatsbelieve is under some pressure from the Kremlin to open up toreform.</TEXT></DOC>
