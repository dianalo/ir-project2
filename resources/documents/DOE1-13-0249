Since one of the mainchoosing criteria is the solar reactor feeding security, the heat exchangersmust not present any clogging risk. Therefore, a comparative study wasinitiated to compare the two possible systems: a perforated plates columnand an overflow pipes column. The analysis of previous investigationsindicates that experimental data about perforated plates and overflowpipes fluidized beds are separately available, but new experiments andtheoretical studies are required to compare these two systems. Thermalefficiency of such heat exchangers is influenced by the flow of the solidand the counter current flow of gas through the columns, consequentlythe authors develop both hydrodynamic and thermic investigations.</TEXT></DOC>
