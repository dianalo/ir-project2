Mitsotakis, a conservative, favors less control of the economyand closer U.S. ties than Papandreou, who has been in power nearlyeight years.   The prime minister, speaking from the steps of his two-storyvilla in the northern Athens suburb of Ekali, acknowledged hisPanhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) would finish behindMitsotakis' New Democracy Party.   But he thanked his supporters for not giving ``an absolutemajority to the forces of conservatism.'' The premier refused toanswer any questions about a possible coalition but noted thatparties from the left would have a majority in Parliament.   Mitsotakis refused to concede his party would not win a majority.   ``What is certain is that New Democracy has toppled PASOK fromthe government,'' Mitsotakis told a cheering crowd outside hisAthens office.   State television said that with 55 percent of the ballots countedthe New Democracy Party was getting 45.1 percent of the vote andPASOK 38.6 percent. The Coalition of Left and Progress had 12.8percent with the remaining votes scattered among minor parties.   At stake were the 300 seats in Parliament. Definitive resultswere not expected until later Monday.   However, government computer projections indicated that if themargins held New Democracy would win 147 seats, PASOK 122, theCoalition of Left and Progress 29, and the two remaining seats wouldbe split between two small parties.   Voting is mandatory and the Interior Ministry said 85.6 percentof Greece's 7.89 million voters cast ballots. The penalty for notvoting ranges from a fine to suspension of a passport for one year.   Greeks chose from among 25 parties and 3,000 candidates but onlyPASOK and the center-right New Democracy Party had any chance tolead the next government.   Returns showed Greece faces the possibility of its firstcoalition or minority government since the return to democracy in1974 or months of instability and possible new elections in the fall.   The Coalition of Left and Progress, a new alliance of the GreekCommunist Party and the Greek Left Party, hoped to become a powerbroker if no party won a majority.   However, Papandreou and Mitsotakis said they would reject anycommunist support to form a new government.   Papandreou and his party handily defeated Mitsotakis and NewDemocracy in the last national elections in 1985 and held 154Parliament seats coming into this election.   New Democracy had 111 seats, followed by the communists withnine. Democratic Renewal, a conservative splinter group, had eightseats, the Left Party had one, and independents held the remaining17.   But the charismatic premier has been stung by financial and armsscandals in his government, the divorce from his American-born wife,Margaret, and his affair with a woman half his 70 years.   When Papandreou voted Sunday, accompanied by fiance DimitraLiani, he called the balloting a ``most critical election that willdecide the future of the land.''   ``Tomorrow will be a new and better day for Greece,'' Mitsotakissaid after he voted.   Mitsotakis, 71, portrayed himself as an advocate of a free-marketeconomy and stronger ties with NATO, the European Economic Communityand other Western industrialized countries, including the UnitedStates.   He contended Papandreou is responsible for the financial scandalsshaking the government and promised to clean up Greek politics andjail the guilty.   The largest scandal swirls around the collapse of the Bank ofCrete, which was owned by Greek financier George Koskotas, who isaccused of stealing $200 million.   Koskotas, who is in a Massachusetts jail fighting extradition toGreece, has claimed in published interviews that Papandreou andmembers of his party took much of the money to finance the electioncampaign. The scandal has led to the firing or resignation of eightmembers of Papandreou's government, but the premier denieswrongdoing.   Papandreou described the outcry over the scandals as part of anattempt to undermine his government and programs.   Papandreou, a former American citizen and economics professor atU.S. universities, came to power in 1981, promising to pull out ofNATO and the EEC and to close U.S. military bases in Greece.   But now he says the country has benefited from the Western ties,and he is negotiating a new base agreement with the Americans.   Still, the premier has often been at odds with the United States.He condemned the April 1986 U.S. bombing of Libya, which theAmericans said was in retaliation for a terrorist attack. Hisgovernment has reacted angrily to U.S. allegations that it is softon terrorism.   Papandreou has painted himself as a defender of the welfare statein Greece and at the same time has argued that his economic policyis both sound and effective.   He contends he has been acting to shrink Greece's public sectordeficit, the largest in the EEC, and notes he has reduced theinflation rate from 25 percent to 14 percent. That is still thehighest in the Common Market.</TEXT></DOC>
