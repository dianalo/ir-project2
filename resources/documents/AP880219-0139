C. Warnke. ``By getting rid of a categoryof nuclear weapons that are particularly vulnerable and adapted forfirst use, the treaty admirably meets this test.''   Warnke formerly served as director of the Arms Control andDisarmament Agency. His testimony, along with the other threeexperts, concluded a third week of hearings by the committee, whichis one of three in the Senate considering the pact.   The treaty also was criticized Friday by William Van Cleave, ofthe Hoover Institution at Stanford University. He told the panelthat ``it is not in our interest.''   The accord was signed in December by Soviet leader Mikhail S.Gorbachev and President Reagan. It eliminates U.S. and Sovietnuclear-tipped missiles with a range of between 310 and 3,400 miles.   The administration has pushed hard for Senate ratification,which will require a two-thirds vote of the 100-member chamber.Senate leaders say approval is likely.   Warnke told the panel that ``from the standpoint of strategicpolicy, intermediate and shorter-range missiles fail to meet thebasic criteria strategic stability.''   ``Because of their areas of deployment, many of them are highlyvulnerable,'' he said. ``Moreover, because of the shorter rangesinvolved, ballistic missiles in these categories can strike theirtargets within a few minutes and thus provide virtually no warningtime.''   The treaty also offers political gains, Warnke said, because itshows the ability of the 16-member North Atlantic TreatyOrganization to stand together and face down political opponentswho opposed the U.S. weapons that were deployed starting in 1983,he said.   Ralph Earle Jr., policy director of the Lawyers Alliance forNuclear Arms Control, a private group, echoed Warnke's comments.   ``To discard the treaty now would undermine the solidarity andsupport the United States has received from our allies around theworld,'' Earle said.   ``What this treaty does is put arms control back on the trackfollowing a hiatus of eight years,'' he told the panel. ``It putsthe signature of a conservative American president on an armscontrol pact, lending the process further credibility with thepublic and in Congress.''   ``This treaty can, and should, be used to galvanize support forfurther reductions in conventional and strategic nuclear arms,''Earle said.   Jonathan Dean, arms control adviser to the Union of ConcernedScientists, said the treaty ``has done more than any event of thepast 40 years to promote a European feeling of responsibility fortheir own defense and for intra-European defense cooperation.''   The chief military effect ``is to improve NATO's theater-rangenuclear position while enhancing crisis stability,'' Dean told thepanel. ``Consequently, the agreement creates no new need to improveNATO's nuclear forces. It makes no sense to build down nuclearweapons with one hand and build them up with the other.''   William Schneider Jr., chairman of the U.S. General AdvisoryCommittee on Arms Control and Disarmament, praised the treaty'sverification provisions, which include short-notice inspections andon-site inspections.   He noted the Soviets' ``abysmal record'' of complying with pastarms control agreements and noted the new treaty ``provides animportant opportunity to begin to correct this problem.''   Van Cleave, criticizing the treaty, said he believes the mainSoviet aim is to cripple Reagan's Star Wars anti-missile defenseresearch program and other U.S. efforts aimed at building upwestern defenses.   ``Virtually every western modernization program, particularly inthe nuclear areas, would be greatly dampened by the current climateof arms control,'' he told the panel.</TEXT></DOC>
