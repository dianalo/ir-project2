Capra, senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc. But he added that trading was &quot;pretty thin, and so it didn't take much to move it down.&quot;    Long-term Treasury bonds dropped about 1 1/4 points, or $12.50 for each $1,000 face amount. The yield on 30-year Treasury issues rose to nearly 9%, the highest level in about two weeks and up from about 8 7/8% Tuesday. Prices of corporate, municipal and mortgage-backed bonds also declined, but not as much as Treasurys.    The Commodity Research Bureau's futures price index rose 3.15 points yesterday to 265.79.    A rumor circulated through the markets late yesterday that the Bank of Japan had advised some Japanese financial institutions not to hold dollars or dollar-denominated assets overnight. The rumor was later denied by the Bank of Japan. Nonetheless, several traders said the rumor helped push bonds sharply lower and sparked a downturn in the dollar.    Speculation also is widespread that a government report to be released tomorrow will show strong U.S. economic growth during June. Traders fear that would heighten inflation fears even further and possibly even persuade the Federal Reserve Board to push short-term interest rates slightly higher.    The Labor Department will release its June report on the nation's employment picture. According to the average estimate of a dozen economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report, the number of workers on non-farm payrolls rose 236,000 last month, compared with 209,000 in May. Also, the June civilian unemployment rate is expected to show a decline of 0.1 percentage point to 5.5%.    The June employment data are seen as critical to the near-term direction of the bond market. &quot;The report will show economic strength,&quot; said Joseph Carson, economist at Chemical Bank. He expects an increase of 260,000 in business payrolls and a drop in the jobless rate to 5.5% or possibly 5.4%.    Traders said yesterday's bond slump also was caused partly by reports of unexpectedly strong car sales by U.S. auto makers. Some analysts interpreted that as another indication that the economy is growing too rapidly and that it will generate higher inflation soon.    Treasury Securities   Higher prices for oil and other commodities jarred bond traders yesterday.    Oil is widely viewed as an important symbol of inflation pressures. Also, the Commodity Research Bureau's index of futures prices, viewed as a key inflation barometer, surged 3.15 points to 265.79.    An index of long-term Treasury issues, compiled by Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., fell 12.80 points to 1235.62. It ranged between 1235.27 and 1246.14.    The government's 9 1/8% bonds due 2018 fell to a price of 101 12/32 late yesterday from 102 20/32 Tuesday. The yield rose to 8.99% from 8.87%.    The Treasury's latest 10-year notes declined to 100 1/2 from 101 7/32. The yield rose to 8.92% from 8.81%.    Rates on short-term Treasury bills declined slightly. The latest three-month bills were quoted late yesterday at 6.53% bid, down from an average rate of 6.57% set at Tuesday's government auction. The rate on six-month bills late yesterday was 6.68%, down from 6.71% Tuesday.    Municipals   Municipal bonds edged lower yesterday in very light activity.    Prices of state and local government issues started off on a soft note as Treasury bonds eroded on concern over a weakening dollar. As the afternoon wore on, the downturn was extended by rumors, later denied by the U.S. Defense Department, that a U.S. plane had been shot down in the Persian Gulf.    A surge in commodity prices exacerbated the slump, traders said. But municipals were helped by the lack of new issues and a lack of institutional selling pressure.    The closely tracked New Jersey Turnpike Authority 7.20% bonds due 2018 declined to 90 3/8 bid from 90 3/4 late Tuesday. The yield was 8.05%.    Separately, New York State Comptroller Edward V. Regan's Commission on Public Debt Issuance released a report yesterday including a recommendation to loosen restrictions on the issuance of state general obligation bonds.    The commission recommended that the state be permitted to authorize the sale of general obligation bonds by a law that is approved by the vote of three-fifths of the members elected to each house of the legislature. At present, the state must receive the majority approval of the electorate to issue general obligation bonds.    The commission, created by Comptroller Regan in January 1987, was charged with studying &quot;the constitutional provisions and laws which govern borrowing by the state and local governments,&quot; according to the report. L. Eugene Crowley, formerly a managing director at Salomon Brothers Inc., was chairman of the commission.    Mr. Regan said yesterday he is &quot;not ready yet to take a position&quot; on the commission's recommendation regarding changes in authorization for the sale of general obligation bonds. The comptroller has long opposed so-called back-door financing techniques. Back-door financing refers to the issuance of bonds not backed by the state's full faith and credit and subject to annual appropriation of the legislature.    Both Messrs. Regan and Crowley emphasized that the recommendations are aimed at increasing the flexibility of New York state and its municipalities in the issuance of municipal notes and bonds.    Implementation of the commission's recommendation on the issuance of general obligation debt would require an amendment to the state constitution.    Corporate Issues   Although corporate bond prices slumped, activity perked up in the new-issue arena.    Three major new offerings were launched yesterday. The largest was a $300 million issue of 10-year notes by KfW International Finance Inc. through First Boston Corp.    The 9 3/8% notes were priced at par. That represented a spread of 0.52 percentage point above the rate of the Treasury 10-year note. First Boston syndicate officials said the deal was all sold.    The notes came at a spread to Treasurys slightly wider than the original 0.50 percentage point that some analysts had estimated earlier in the day.    The notes are guaranteed by the company's parent, Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau, which in turn is an instrumentality of the West German government. The notes were rated triple-A by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.    Foreign Bonds   Japanese and West German government bond prices rose again yesterday but British gilts declined slightly.    The West German government's bellwether 6 1/2% issue due 1998 closed at a price of 99.25 bid, up 0.20 from Tuesday's close. The yield declined to 6.60% from 6.63% Tuesday.    Euromark prices were little changed over the day. The European Investment Bank's 5 7/8% issue due 1998 closed in interdealer trading at 98.25 bid, 0.05 point higher than Tuesday.    Despite yesterday's rally, some analysts expect a further rise in West German interest rates after last week's 1/2 percentage point hike in the discount rate to 3% and a 1/4 percentage point rise in the Bundesbank's securities repurchase rate to 3 3/4%.    &quot;If the dollar stays high against the mark, we might have to see higher rates here to strengthen the mark,&quot; a dealer said.    In Tokyo, the government's benchmark 5% No. 105 issue due 1997 closed at a price of 100.22, up 0.16 on the day. The yield declined to 4.965% from 4.99%. The range on the session was 4.92% to 5%.    In London, British gilts edged slightly lower after seesawing throughout the day. The slight declines followed Tuesday's huge rally of about 1 1/2 points in some bellwether issues. Several dealers were surprised by the slump in view of the pound's continued strong performance and the increasing likelihood that United Kingdom base rates will remain steady at 10%.    But some analysts said domestic institutions remain unconvinced that the pound will remain as high as it is, and they are still worried about inflation rising over 5%.    &quot;Institutions are still very uncertain. They are unwilling to commit cash,&quot; said Glenn Davies, a senior economist with CLAlexanders Laing andamp; Cruickshank.    Analysts say the government probably also wants base rates to remain at current levels. Base rates, which have risen five times over the last five weeks, appear to have reached a level that will force mortgage rates to be increased as well -- a move that many see as necessary for reducing inflationary pressures in the housing market.    The benchmark Treasury 11 3/4% issue due 2003/2007 was quoted late in the day at 115 29/32, down 1/2 point, to yield 9.68%. The issue rose at one stage to 116 21/32. Among shorter-term issues, the Treasury 11 3/4% issue due 1991 fell 6/32 of a point to 104 to yield 9.89%, while the Treasury 12% issue due 1995 fell 3/8 point to 109 28/32 to yield 9.91%.    Eurodollar bond prices fell slightly, reflecting early declines in U.S. Treasury securities and a $1.7 billion onslaught of new offerings. The largest of these offerings was $1 billion of 9% five-year bonds by Italy, through underwriters at Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd.    Mortgage-Backed Securities   Ginnie Maes and other mortgage securities held up better than Treasurys as active issues ended 1/8 to 1/2 point lower.    Fannie Mae 10% securities were particularly strong, reflecting a scarcity of the issue and the tendency of conventional mortgage securities to decline less than Ginnie Maes in falling markets.    July Fannie Mae 10% securities were quoted at 100 11/32 bid, down 6/32, while Freddie Mac 10% securities were off 8/32, and Ginnie Mae 10% securities were down 12/32.    July Ginnie Mae 9% securities finished at 94 18/32 bid, down 14/32; 9 1/2% securities at 97 14/32 bid, down 10/32; and 10% securities at 100 1/4 bid. The 10% issue was yielding 10.09% to a 12-year average life assumption. </TEXT></DOC>
