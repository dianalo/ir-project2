North and is doing everything possible torelease the necessary classified documents.   Spokesman Roman Popadiuk responded to a statement by JudgeGerhard A. Gesell, who said at a hearing in U.S. District CourtThursday, ``The highest levels of the government have to make adecision as to whether this case is going to go or if it's notgoing to go.''   Gesell suggested that Attorney General Edwin Meese III name aJustice Department official to help the administration decidewhether it is willing to make the disclosures of national securitydocuments that are necessary to move the case to trial.   Popadiuk said a team of senior officials has been spending ``aninordinate amount of hours'' to meet the demand for relase ofclassified documents.   ``We want the legal proceedings to go forward, but the questionof a trial is up to the judge and the prosecutor,'' Popadiuk said.``We are doing everything we possibly can.''   Popadiuk added that he could not say whether the administrationwould consider any further steps to speed up the declassificationprocess.   The judge said that he wondered whether ``we don't need a cleardecision from the administration itself that they want to try thiscase or they don't want to.''   Gesell made the comments after he heard independent counselLawrence E. Walsh's request for a month's delay in the productionof 150,000 pages of classified CIA and Justice Department documentsstill to be reviewed by an interagency task force.   The group, composed of officials from the agencies that producedthe documents, must identify the passages the government doesn'twant disclosed in court, Walsh said. It cannot complete the work byJuly 1.   While the members of the interagency task force are ``not tryingto torpedo the case or help the case,'' they ``are not in theposition to judge the larger implications of the case,'' the judgesaid.   ``But the obstacles keep arising.''   Voicing frustration at the additional delay, the judge indicatedthat he had planned on Friday to issue an order setting the datefor North's trial. ``I'm not going to do that. The case isn'tready,'' he said.   ``If you can't get a trial going soon there isn't going to be atrial,'' Gesell told lawyers on both sides.   The hearing was held a day after Gesell had given North untilJuly 11 to specify which secret documents he wants to disclose incourt when the case goes to trial.   The fired National Security Council aide is accused ofconspiring with former national security adviser John M.Poindexter, and arms dealers Albert Hakim and Richard V. Secord toillegally divert U.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguanrebels. Gesell ordered separate trials for each of the four.   So far, 82,000 pages of classified documents have been turnedover to the defense for pretrial inspection.   Walsh said that ``a much smaller number but still a largenumber'' of documents were relevant to the case. He said he doubtedthat many of the 150,000 pages of unreviewed material would beadmissible as evidence.   Under the Classified Information Procedures Act, a defendantmust notify the court before trial of his intention to disclosespecific secrets in court.   The court has the power to delete portions of documents thegovernment doesn't want disclosed or to substitute statements offacts that the material would prove if shown to the jury.   But if there is a sufficient quantity of secret material thatcannot be edited, the judge is empowered to dismiss the charges ifthe government refuses to let it be disclosed in court.   An alternative to dismissing all the charges in the Iran-Contracase would be to try the defendants on those counts of theindictment that don't involve the wide use of classified documents.   Clearly the main conspiracy count against all four defendantswould require the greatest disclosure of government secrets to showthey acted with authority of high government officials.   North and Poindexter might not be entitled to disclose as manysecrets to rebut charges that they lied to Congress or obstructed apresidential inquiry into the Iran-Contra affair.   The same would hold for charges that North obstructed an FBIinquiry into who paid for a $15,000 security fence around his homein Great Falls, Va., or that he pocketed some of the travelerschecks given to him by a Contra leader to cover expenses.</TEXT></DOC>
