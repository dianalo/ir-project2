Keating Jr. personally transformedLincoln Savings andamp; Loan Association from a traditionalmortgage lender to a maker of huge, riskier loans todevelopers and builders, a former aide testified at Mr.Keating's trial on California-state criminal fraud charges.   Within months after American Continental, based inPhoenix, Ariz., bought Lincoln in February 1984, Mr. Keatingsaw to it that 85% of Lincoln's headquarters staff was fired,Robin S. Symes, a star prosecution witness, told jurors.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Symes, one of the managers Mr. Keating installed, saidMr. Keating ordered them to make the sleepy thrift grow bypaying high interest on huge deposits brought in by brokers.At the same time, Mr. Symes said, Lincoln stopped lending toCalifornia home buyers and started making loans averaging $10million for projects in Arizona, Texas, and the Southeast.   Under questioning from Deputy District Attorney WilliamHodgman, he testified that eventually Mr. Keating transferredall loan records to Phoenix, a move that caused problems whenstate and federal bank examiners examined Lincoln in 1986.Demonstrating that Mr. Keating exerted such control overLincoln is essential for prosecutors to prove ties to acts bysales people in another state.   In a plea bargain, Mr. Symes pleaded guilty to federal andstate securities-fraud charges last July and agreed totestify against Mr. Keating. Like Mr. Keating, he faced up to10 years in prison. However, he could get as little asprobation.   Mr. Keating, first arrested on the state charges a yearago this week, sat stolidly in court as Mr. Symes testified.   The state alleges that Mr. Keating knew about and aideddeceptive sales of American Continental junk bonds at Lincolnbranches. Investors lost $250 million on the bonds, whichbecame nearly worthless when American Continental filed forbankruptcy protection and Lincoln was seized by regulators inApril 1989. en</TEXT></DOC>
