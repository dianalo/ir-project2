The attorneys said an adviser to the federal judgeoverseeing the case approached them about the possiblerenegotiation. In return, the attorneys were asked towithdraw their appeals and drop plans to ask the judge toremove himself from the case, said Frederick Baron, anasbestos plaintiffs' attorney in Dallas.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Baron and other plaintiffs' attorneys have claimedU.S. Judge Jack B. Weinstein of Brooklyn overstepped hisauthority by approving the $505 million settlement earlierthis month. They claim the judge doesn't have the power toorder a mandatory class action for cases in otherjurisdictions, and that the settlement was reached withoutthe participation of attorneys actually representing asbestosvictims.   Mr. Baron said he was contacted by Leon Silverman, aspecial adviser to Judge Weinstein in negotiating a recentrestructuring of the Manville asbestos personal-injury trust.Mr. Baron said he was told by Mr. Silverman that anarrangement could be made to renegotiate the settlement ifthe attorneys dropped their challenges against JudgeWeinstein.   &quot;He told us maybe we could cut a better deal&quot; with thecompany, Mr. Baron said.   As part of the proposal, Eagle-Picher would also drop aracketeering suit it filed against Mr. Baron and two otherplaintiffs attorneys, Mr. Baron said. The suit accuses theattorneys of &quot;malicious prosecution&quot; in an effort to putEagle-Picher into involuntary bankruptcy earlier this month.   Mr. Silverman confirmed that he has spoken to theattorneys about the Eagle-Picher litigation, but said he wasacting as a volunteer. &quot;No one has invited me,&quot; he said.&quot;This is not being done under the aegis of Judge Weinstein.&quot;   Mr. Silverman declined to comment on what he suggested tothe attorneys, and he stressed that he has no official rolein the Eagle-Picher case. The Eagle-Picher settlement and Mr.Silverman's work on the Manville case are consideredimportant steps in Judge Weinstein's plan for grappling withasbestos litigation nationwide.   Eagle-Picher declined to comment. Judge Weinstein's officealso declined to comment.   Mr. Baron said he isn't willing to withdraw his appeal ofthe Eagle-Picher settlement. He said a motion to have JudgeWeinstein removed from the litigation may be made next week.   Ronald Motley, another plaintiffs' attorney contacted byMr. Silverman, said, &quot;It is not my practice to comment onsettlement negotiations.&quot;   ---   PENNSYLVANIA HIGH COURT to decide if caller ID serviceinvades privacy.   The state supreme court will be the first in the nation todecide whether the service, which allows customers to viewphone numbers of incoming calls, should be banned on privacygrounds. The outcome will have broad implications; phonecompanies across the country are lining up to offer theservice to residential customers.   Last May, a Pennsylvania appeals court ruled that Bell ofPennsylvania's Caller ID Service violated state wiretap lawsand constitutional provisions protecting privacy. Ruling infavor of the state Consumer Advocate's office and privacy andcivil rights groups, the court overturned a decision by thestate Public Utilities Commission allowing the Bell AtlanticCorp. unit to offer the service, so long as certain agencies,including police and shelters for abused women and children,were able to block transmission of their numbers.   The Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court ruled that the serviceviolates the state's ban on so-called trap and trace devicesand said the service is illegal whether or not customers canblock transmission.   The supreme court is not expected to rule before nextspring.   ---   FOUR MEN CONVICTED of laundering drug money injewelry-store scheme.
