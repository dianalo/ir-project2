Seated in his Lima office with a bust of Lenin looking on, the senator -- who was elected with more votes than all but one of his colleagues -- seems uninterested in the shooting outside and continues to lambast President Alan Garcia, whose recent nationalization of private banks, he says, didn't go far enough. It &quot;won't destroy the monopolistic power of the oligopoly,&quot; says the senator, a Marxist in a country where the extreme left holds a quarter of the vote.    Such is Peru today, full of workaday violence, discord and the language of class struggle. The unexplained gunfire outside causes little stir because the death of 10,000 people since 1980 in terrorist-linked violence has made shooting banal. Just yesterday, someone hurled dynamite at the U.S. consulate in Lima, knocking out windows up to the 10th floor of the high-rise building in which it is located. It was early in the morning, and no one was injured.    This situation predated the president's July 28 move to nationalize 10 commercial banks, a takeover that is expected to become law soon. The government says the takeover is needed to break the stranglehold on the economy of a small group of speculative financiers and so lay the basis for lasting growth. But, for the moment, it has sharpened divisions, sapped confidence and increased the possibility that South America's third-largest country will succumb to violence and subversion.    Peru is in deep trouble only two years after the left-leaning President Garcia swept to power amid the optimism symbolized by his youthful good looks. A sharp economic rebound based partly on defiance of foreign-bank creditors has faltered. Inflation is accelerating, purchasing power and reserves are falling and capital is again fleeing the country.    Traditional Latin American problems of a restive military, pervasive poverty, drug trafficking and an uncompetitive economy have been compounded here by the emergence of the Maoist Shining Path and other guerrilla groups, distinguished by their dedication to destruction.    &quot;In every walk of life, people are afraid. The economic situation is desperate. And this (bank nationalization) law added new divisiveness,&quot; says Manuel Ulloa, economy minister in the right-wing administration that preceded the Garcia government. He is seated in his large house in the chic Miraflores district. There are Japanese prints on the wall -- and a revolver on the table next to him. If he is to be killed, he wants to go out shooting.    Mr. Ulloa is sure he's on Shining Path's hit list. Every month he and other congressmen go to military facilities to practice firing pistols and submachine guns.    To Mario Vargas Llosa, the novelist who has led the campaign against the bank nationalization, the violence is part of a &quot;new thuggery&quot; that has made Peru &quot;the worst case in South America.&quot; His house overlooking the Pacific now has two guards. Since he began to speak out against the totalitarianism he sees in the bank measure, he has been receiving threats. &quot;For the first time in my life,&quot; he says, &quot;I need protection.&quot;    Others are used to it. The chief officer of a U.S. bank in Lima says it has suffered three bomb attacks in the past six weeks. He and his family live under armed guard. He believes the five foreign banks still in Peru could leave if conditions don't improve. &quot;When the phone goes again at 5:30 in the morning,&quot; he says, &quot;I pick it up and ask: Which branch this time?&quot;    Most analysts believe the guerrillas' power has grown since President Garcia took office. Much of the country is in a state of emergency. The Shining Path, whose membership is estimated by former Interior Minister Abel Salinas at between 10,000 and 12,000, has spread from its Ayacucho stronghold. The president says there is evidence of a potentially devastating link between guerrillas and cocaine traffickers north of Ayacucho.    Economy Minister Gustavo Saberbein believes this development should be of more concern to the U.S. than Nicaragua. &quot;If the guerrillas join forces with drug traffickers, they'll have tremendous finance, and power,&quot; he says. Sales of cocaine paste, from which cocaine is refined outside Peru, are estimated at $1 billion a year.    To counter subversion, the minister says Peru already spends 5% of its total output of goods and services on internal defense -- and this doesn't include arms purchases. But he contends this isn't enough to curb a guerrilla movement that has an inevitable appeal in a country where only one-third of the population has a steady job.    &quot;It isn't enough (just) to grow. The government must give signs that it is redistributing (wealth), that the artisan can also have access to credit,&quot; he says. Thus, in the thinking of the president's social democratic Apra party, the nationalization is needed to stem leftist extremism.    Certainly, perhaps half the population favors the bank nationalization. There is some consensus that credit was excessively concentrated in Lima and among the business elite. Some think loans may now reach more people in the countryside who were potential Shining Path recruits.    But the evidence is that the measure has made Peru more inclined to extremism. President Garcia seems to have alarmed the armed forces and lost the support of the middle classes, who once saw him and Apra as a bulwark against Marxism. At the same time, he has failed to impress the Marxist parties.    Ricardo Vega Llona, chairman of the private sector business association, says he met the president in June and came away thinking the leader was a &quot;modern, coherent, pragmatic entrepreneur.&quot; Now he think's he's a liar. &quot;You can't lie as much as Garcia has and get away with it,&quot; he says. &quot;He's dead politically, and confidence won't be rebuilt easily.&quot;    Retired Gen. Luis Cisneros is more alarmist. He says President Garcia's victory in 1985 stemmed from a &quot;vote against communism.&quot; Now this has been betrayed by the nationalization and the failure to tackle the guerrillas, he says. &quot;I doubt we'll get to 1990 without a coup unless there are big rectifications,&quot; he warns.    There are firm supporters of President Garcia within the armed forces, according to intelligence sources. But restiveness has risen, they add.    Rumors in Lima say the army is being goaded by owners of the banks that are to be expropriated. Guillermo Wiese de Osma, chairman of Banco Wiese, the second-largest nationalized bank, denies this. &quot;Unlike the government, we respect the law,&quot; he says.    Mr. Wiese, age 59, seems a broken man. The bank was founded in 1944 by his father, Augusto, a German immigrant. The founder's massive English desk, at which his son had sat through much of his working life, has just been removed, and Mr. Wiese receives visitors from behind a flimsy desk. &quot;Nobody else will sit at my father's desk,&quot; he says vehemently.    Mr. Wiese says he's indignant and wants to know how much he will be paid for the bank. &quot;People are terrified,&quot; he says, as he wanders like a dazed man through the corridors of the bank, his laughter sometimes seeming out of control, showing a visitor a collection of pre-Inca art that he personally amassed. Because it belongs to the bank, he won't remove it. &quot;What will they pay us for this?&quot; he asks.    President Garcia has style and an easy smile, and speaks in an interview with an abundant, sometimes exalted, assurance. &quot;We want to change our world a little, not just improve it,&quot; he says.    His arguments are clear:   Peru in 1985 was in a ruinous state, its gross domestic product fallen to mid-1960s levels because of low prices for its main exports, the pressures of payments on its then-$14 billion foreign debt, and a &quot;colonial submission&quot; to the policies of the International Monetary Fund.    So debt payments were limited to 10% of export earnings, interest rates were slashed, the minimum wage was almost doubled, the exchange rate was fixed following a devaluation, and an attempt was made to cut the public deficit through lower military spending and guarded use of funds gained from nonpayment of debt. Initial results were impressive: Economic growth was more than 8% last year (the economy had contracted more than 12% in 1983), and inflation dropped to about 4% a month from 12%, employment rose and the exchange rate held steady.    But problems emerged. Inflation is headed for more than 100% this year. As idle capacity was used up, investment from the &quot;econoic empires dmonopols&quot; did not come, President Garcia says.    On the contrary, exchange-rate pressure mounted as businessmen tried to turn profits into dollars. Banks, it seemed increasingly to the president, were &quot;the central point of injustice,&quot; sucking money to Lima and using it for speculating rather than productive investment.&quot;    So, he says, nationalization was necessary to follow up on last year's growth with investments, create hope in the countryside by setting up new regional banks, and end the unproductive concentration of economic power. The president says it won't be followed by further takeovers. He argues that the intense debate proves democracy's strength in Peru. &quot;Any economic change without liberty isn't an economic revolution,&quot; he says.    Others contend the president panicked because of the abrupt rise in inflation, a loss of reserves running at close to $100 million a month, a slowing of the economy, the desertion of Luis Alva Castro, a former premier and political rival who quit in June, and a sense that the new prime minister, Guillermo Larco Cox, might be trying to push Apra policies to the right. &quot;It was a capricious attempt to regain control,&quot; says editor Enrique Zileri.    This view is shared by those who say the president could have achieved his aims without nationalization. Half of commercial-bank activity was already in state hands, and credit could have been redirected by regulations, they say.    Having tried for two years to work with the business establishment, the president has opted to push his populist nationalism to the point of breaking with the traditional structure of Peruvian capitalism.    It's a gamble. &quot;If people feel what they have can be taken away,&quot; asks Mr. Vargas Llosa, the novelist, &quot;how can they be motivated?&quot;    ---            A Look at Peru Population            20.2 million GDP Growth             8.5% Per-capita GDP        $1,030 Gross external debt   $16.2 billion Imports               $2.486 billion Exports               $2.491 billion Trade surplus         $5 million    NOTE: All figures are for 1986.
