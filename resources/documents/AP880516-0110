(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   PTL expected to file a revisedreorganization plan in U.S. Bankruptcy Court this afternoon thatessentially puts the $200 million, 2,200-acre evangelical empire onthe auction block, officials said today.   PTL wants to sell Heritage USA in Fort Mill, or at least enoughof it to pay off its debts, and then lease the property required tocarry on its church and network television ministries, according toa draft of the plan.   Several proposed buyers already have surfaced, including GeorgeShinn, a sports entrepreneur from Charlotte, N.C.   Judge Rufus Reynolds ordered PTL last month to devise an orderlyplan of liquidation of its assets to pay its debts. The ministryhad failed to raise enough money to meet its operating expenses andpay the first installment of its debt as specified under theoriginal reorganization plan filed in December.   Under the revised plan, Reynolds would appoint a board of threebusinessmen, possibly headed by PTL Vice President M.C. ``Red''Benton, to preside over PTL as a self-liquidating trust, said DavidWest, PTL director of public relations.   PTL's assets, including a hotel and convention center, a waterpark, a residential development and about 1,700 acres ofundeveloped land a few miles south of Charlotte, are worth anestimated $160 million to $200 million. The organization's debtsare estimated to range between $75 million and $130 million.   Whatever money or property remained after debts were paid wouldgo back to the non-profit arm of the ministry, Heritage Ministries,which would operate the church and television network, thespokesman said.   The Charlotte Observer reported Sunday that several groupsapparently are planning to compete with Shinn in bidding onHeritage USA. The newspaper reported that at least one group ofcreditors, dubious about Shinn's willingness to provide up-frontcash in his bid to buy PTL, is seeking a buyer more to its liking.   Another offer is expected from a new Salt Lake City corporation,Tango Trading Co. The company, whose principals include former PTLVice President Dale Hill, has announced that it will submit a bidto buy Heritage USA.   PTL has been in financial straits since founders Jim and TammyBakker left the ministry last year amid a sex-and-money scandal.</TEXT></DOC>
