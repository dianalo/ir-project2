Background </ITAG>Title 29 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 1910.1200, ``Hazard Communication,''requires that employees in the manufacturing sector be advised of the hazardsof chemicals with which they work. In order to achieve this purpose, theHazard Communication standard requires that employers obtain Material SafetyData Sheets (MSDS) for all hazardous chemicals they use (the Federal agenciesare already required to do this). Chemical manufacturers and distributorsin the private sector are required to provide MSDS with the hazardous chemicalsthey ship to other distributors and purchasers. In a July 25, 1985 decision,the Department of Labor's Deputy Associate Solicitor for Occupational Safetyand Health determined that ``application of the standard to Federal agencyheads may not, however, be construed as requiring private employers totake any action with respect to Federal agencies, including supplying materialsafety sheets to the agencies.'' Therefore, while chemical manufacturersand distributors must develop or otherwise obtain MSDSs for their hazardousmaterial products to satisfy the requirements of the standard in the privatesector, they are not required to provide them to Federal agencies. Ouronly recourse in obtaining MSDS is to obtain them contractually, a processwhich the proposed change is intended to improve. <ITAG tagnum="84">B. Regulatory Flexibility Act Information </ITAG>The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.,</T3> because the proposed changes will apply to only thosesmall entities who want to contract with the Government to supply hazardousmaterials (as defined in the latest version of Federal Standard 313). Itis likely that most small entities affected by the proposed changes willbe distributors rather than manufacturers. An initial regulatory flexibilityanalysis has therefore not been performed. Comments are invited from smallbusinesses and other interested parties. Comments from small entities concerningthe affected DFARS Subpart will also be considered in accordance with section610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and cite DARCase 88-610D in correspondence. <ITAG tagnum="84">C. Paperwork Reduction Act Information </ITAG>The rule does not contain information collection requirements which requirethe approval of OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501, <T3>et seq.</T3> The reporting requirement in 252.223-7000 has been approvedby OMB under OMB number 0704-0193 and expires on October 31, 1989. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 48 CFR Parts 223, 242 and 252 </ITAG>Government procurement. <ITAG tagnum="6">Charles W.

A new Subpart 223.72, consisting of sections 223.7200 and 223.7201,is added to read as follows: <ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart 223.72_Notice of Radioactive Material</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">223.7200 Contract clause.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">223.7201 Requirements.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart 223.72_Notice of Radioactive Material</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">223.7200</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Contract clause.</ITAG>The Contracting Officer shall insert the clause at 252.223-7000, Noticeof Radioactive Materials, in all contracts for items, components thereof,and materials which are radioactive in which the specific activity is greaterthan 0.002 microcuries per gram. Such contracts include, but are not limitedto, contracts for aircraft, ammunition, missiles, vehicles, electronictubes, instrument panel gauges, compasses and identification markers.<ITAG tagnum="80">223.7201</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Requirements.</ITAG>(a) The clause at 252.223-7000 requires the contractor to notify the contractingofficer prior to delivery of radioactive material.(b) Upon receipt of the notice, the contracting officer shall notify receivingactivities so that appropriate safeguards can be taken.(c) The clause permits the contracting officer to waive the notificationif the contractor certifies that a notification on prior deliveries isstill accurate. The contracting officer may waive the notice only afterconsultation with cognizant technical representatives.3.
