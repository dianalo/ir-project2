IbrahimStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 06/29/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> MDESTPETROLEUM (PET)MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) </IN><DATELINE> VIENNA  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Saudi Arabia and Iran teamed up to produce a compromise by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries that, industry sources say, will firm up oil prices over the next few months, pushing them above the current average of $18 a barrel.    Industry observers viewed the compromise as a remarkable show of unity.    OPEC ended its shortest and most harmonious meeting in four years with a resolution that limits oil production for its members at 16.6 million barrels a day until year-end.    The move represents a compromise between the Iranian-led group of OPEC producers, which wanted to keep output down at 15.8 million barrels a day until December, and the Saudi-led group, which advocated an increase in production by OPEC all the way up to 18.3 million barrels a day. OPEC members currently are producing about 16.5 million barrels a day.    Iraq, which has since January refused to participate in OPEC's quota system, said it wouldn't sign the accord. As it is expected to produce about 2.5 million barrels a day alone by October, the effective level of OPEC production will come closer to 18 million barrels a day in December.    OPEC and industry sources said this total anticipated production is below expected demand for OPEC oil, which various sources estimate to be between 18 million and 19 million barrels a day.    &quot;This accord will firm up oil prices,&quot; said Indonesia's oil minister, Subroto. Iran's oil minister, Gholamreza Aghazadeh, said he expected oil prices to rise to $20 a barrel by December if the group adhered to its accord.    Signs that OPEC might reduce its output ceiling fueled a surge in crude oil prices Friday and led to record volume at the New York Mercantile Exchange. August crude oil contracts soared 60 cents a barrel to $20.24, and futures on unleaded gasoline surged as well.    Although the agreement resulted from a rare degree of harmony among the usually bickering members of the cartel, it left a number of unresolved differences.    &quot;Short meetings tend to sweep things under the carpet,&quot; said Kuwait's oil minister, Ali Khalifa Al-Sabah, a key OPEC member who strongly registered his objection to prices that go beyond OPEC's stated goal of $18 a barrel.    The Kuwaiti delegation argued that the temptation of higher prices will push some OPEC members to exceed their allocated production ceilings and may disrupt the new-found discipline that has governed most OPEC members -- with the exception of Iraq and the United Arab Emirates -- ever since January.    But other ministers said that OPEC went through a terrible period of collapsing oil prices last year and that this instilled enough discipline to last a while. &quot;When good things happen, we mustn't ask why. We must congratulate ourselves and enjoy them,&quot; said Belkacem Nabi, Algeria's oil minister.    The solidity of the agreement depends to a large degree on the harmony that can be maintained between the Iranian and Saudi camps of OPEC. Factors that will influence these developments include:    --The ability of OPEC to persuade, or pressure, Iraq to moderate its maverick behavior sometime between now and December. The Iraqis are on the verge of adding another 500,000 barrels a day to their runaway production of more than two million barrels a day with the imminent inauguration of a new pipeline to the Mediterranean Sea via Turkey.    --The projected demand for OPEC oil, which depends on the health of the world economy and the confidence of oil companies in OPEC's policies. If companies trust in the new OPEC discipline, they will move from their hand-to-mouth purchasing policies to sign long-term buying contracts, thus giving OPEC producers cash and confidence to avoid cheating.    --The behavior of non-OPEC producers, such as the U.S.S.R., Norway, Egypt, Mexico and others, which in the past rushed to give discounts to steal OPEC's potential customers whenever demand increased.    &quot;As we look around us today, the portents are good for OPEC,&quot; said the group's president, Nigerian Oil Minister Rilwanu Lukman. But he added, &quot;We should not allow ourselves to slide into complacency.&quot;    Ministerial sources said some way must be found to rein in Iraq's maverick behavior. OPEC said it will dispatch a delegation of three oil ministers to impress this view on Iraq's president, Saddam Hussein. The delegation also will visit with the president of the United Arab Emirates.    The real determining factor of the prospects for OPEC harmony remains the course of the seven-year-old war between Iran and Iraq. Iran, which until December dominated OPEC's deliberations because of its triumphant conduct of the war, seems to be losing its touch. With no new victories to mention this year, its influence is diminishing to the benefit of Saudi Arabia. While Iran continues to argue for higher oil prices, the Saudis' desire for moderate prices seems to prevail.    More importantly, Iran has failed to find some way of limiting Iraq's oil production or pressuring Saudi Arabia into doing so. </TEXT></DOC>
