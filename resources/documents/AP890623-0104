RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court today made it more difficultfor older workers to prove that when some of their benefits arereduced their employers violated a federal law against agediscrimination.   By a 7-2 vote, the court revived an Ohio pension law provisionchallenged by a woman forced to retire because of a disability.   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, writing for the court, said to winher case the woman must prove that the reduced benefits resultedfrom ``an intent to discriminate in some non-fringe benefit aspectof the employment relation.''   The ruling apparently means that workers charging age bias insuch cases must prove reduced fringe benefits were aimed, forexample, at discouraging older workers from applying for jobs orwere intended to force them to quit.   Justice Thurgood Marshall, in a dissenting opinion, said theruling ``immunizes virtually all employee benefit programs fromliability under the (federal) Age Discrimination in Employment Actof 1967.''   He said, ``Henceforth, liability will not attach under the ADEAeven if an employer is unable to put forth any jusitification fordenying older workers the benefits younger ones receive, and indeed,even if his only reason for discriminating against older workers inbenefits is his abject hostility to, or his unfounded stereotypes ofthem.''   Justice William J. Brennan joined Marshall's dissent.   The case stems from a challenge to an Ohio law by June Betts, aformer speech pathologist for the Hamilton County Mental RetardationDepartment.   When her work degenerated because of medical problems, Ms. Bettswas given a choice by the state in 1985 of taking unpaid medicalleave or retirement with a standard pension.   She was barred from receiving more generous disability retirementbenefits because she was 61.   A provision of the state pension plan allowed disability benefitsonly for those who worked for the state for at least five years andwere under 60 when forced to quit.   Ms. Betts' pension was $158.50 a month under the standard plan,compared to $355 a month in disability retirement benefits.   The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year upheld a federaljudge's ruling in Ms. Betts' favor that threw out the state'sage-based pension provision.   The appeals court said the provision violated the federal AgeDiscrimination in Employment Act since Ohio officials failed toprove that giving larger benefits to younger workers is justified bycost considerations.   Today's Supreme Court ruling said the state was not required toprove that for the benefit plan to survive.   The case is Public Employees Retirement System of Ohio vs. Betts,88-389.</TEXT></DOC>
