Licenses were awarded by the National Energy Board to Alberta Northeast Gas Ltd., representing 18 U.S. distributors, and four Canadian suppliers. The licenses cover 2.1 trillion cubic feet of gas, to be delivered over 15 years. Shipments are expected to begin Nov. 1, 1988.    The project is the latest and largest of a number of Canadian ventures to develop a market in the Northeast for western Canadian gas. Currently, that market largely is supplied by fuel oil. Yesterday's authorized gas exports of 140 billion cubic feet a year represents two and a half times the volume of Canadian gas exported last year to the Northeast.    The 18 U.S. distributors represented by Alberta Northeast control more than 85% of the natural gas market in New Jersey, the New England states and downstate New York, the agency said.    As previously reported, the gas is to be transported via pipelines from the Canadian border near Niagara Falls and Iroquois, both in Ontario. The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has yet to issue an approval for the building of facilities to move the gas south from near Iroquois. As projected, a 350-mile pipeline from the Canadian border to Long Island, N.Y., would be built at a cost of about $330 million.    A related bid by TransCanada Pipelines Ltd. to expand its existing pipeline system in Canada at a cost equivalent to $187 million currently is being considered by the Canadian regulatory agency.    The licenses issued yesterday were to be held jointly by Alberta Northeast and each of the following: TransCanada Pipelines, Progas Ltd., Atcor Ltd., and AEC Oil andamp; Gas Co. The five main U.S. distributors involved in the Alberta Northeast project are Brooklyn Union Gas Co., Brooklyn, N.Y.; Connecticut Natural Gas Corp., Hartford, Conn.; Northeast Utilities, Hartford; Southern Connecticut Gas Co., a unit of Connecticut Energy Corp., Bridgeport, Conn.; and New Jersey Natural Gas Co., Wall Township, N.J.    In a related move, the National Energy Board yesterday revoked two existing licenses and modified a third, all to TransCanada PipeLines, because these exports now are covered by a new license. </TEXT></DOC>
