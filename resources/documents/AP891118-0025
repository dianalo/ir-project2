The provision was in a compromise bill authorizing thegovernment's intelligence activities for the coming year. Both theHouse and Senate passed the legislation by voice vote.   While President Bush, a former CIA director, is said to objectto establishing a tighter oversight office within the agency,members of the congressional intelligence committees have said theydo not believe he will veto the measure because of the newrequirement.   In addition to setting up a new inspector general, appointed bythe president and confirmed by the Senate, the bill would guaranteethe congressional oversight committees access in most cases to theIG's audit and investigation reports.   CIA Director William Webster has fought the committees over thataccess in the past, and some Republicans complained that Websterhad mishandled the matter.   ``CIA recalcitrance was its own undoing,'' said Rep. BobLivingston, R-La., during House floor debate on the measure.   The new oversight provisions grew out of the Iran-Contrascandal, when the nation's intelligence apparatus skirted the lawto sell arms to Iran and send money to the Nicaraguan Contra rebelsdespite bans on such activity.   But the bill omitted a series of other steps that grew out ofthe Iran-Contra affair, including codification of requirements thatcovert operations be brought to the attention of the intelligencecommittees promptly and in written form, and that any third partiesinvolved be disclosed.   Those provisions were dropped because the House committee wantsto try again next year to negotiate stricter controls with theadministration, and to write anything into the law now wouldpre-empt such discussions, said committee chairman Rep. Anthony C.Beilenson, D-Calif.   The new inspector general position would be like othergovernment agency IGs who conduct audits, review the way programsare run and generally try to ferret out abuses, fraud or waste infederal programs.   Congressional investigators who probed the Iran-Contra scandalsaid the CIA inspector general lacked independence and didn't have``the manpower, resources or tenacity'' to uncoverarms-for-hostages transactions or the diversion of profits toNicaragua's Contra rebels.   Currently, the inspector general is appointed by the CIAdirector and reports only to him.   Opponents of the change, including the White House, had arguedthat it would create an impression that the CIA would be unable toprotect sensitive information, particularly about intelligencesources and methods, and valuable information might dry up.   Money to carry out the government's intelligence operations ishidden in the Pentagon budget and is secret, but reports put theoverall spending level at upwards of $25 billion.   Sources said the bill keeps on track a five-year,multibillion-dollar program to upgrade the nation's intelligencecollection through so-called ``national technical means,'' orsatellites and other electronic spying.   Impetus for the buildup began with U.S. ratification of theintermediate-range nuclear arms control treaty with the SovietUnion, which brought new requirements for verification.   It has been given additional urgency by developments in theSoviet Union and Eastern Europe that enhance the prospects for newstrategic and conventional arms control treaties with the Sovietsin the coming months.</TEXT></DOC>
