General </ITAG>On August 9, 1989, the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and EnforcementAct of 1989 (``FIRREA'') was enacted into law. Among other things, theFIRREA added section 21B to the Federal Home Loan Bank Act (the ``Act'')which established a corporation known as the Resolution Funding Corporation(``Funding Corporation'') to provide funds necessary for the ResolutionTrust Corporation (``RTC'') to carry out its purpose under the FIRREA.The Funding Corporation will issue bonds, notes, debentures, or similarobligations, and with the net proceeds thereof, it will purchase capitalcertificates to be issued by the RTC. Pursuant to the provisions of FIRREA,the Federal home loan banks (``banks''), among others, are to provide fundsto capitalize the Funding Corporation. The Oversight Board, establishedby title V, section 501(a)(1) of the FIRREA (``Board''), has general oversightover the Funding Corporation and Directorate of the Funding Corporation(``Directorate''), which is subject to such regulations, orders, and directionsas the Board may prescribe. The Board shall ensure that the aggregate amount of funds to capitalizethe Funding Corporation is sufficient to purchase noninterest bearing instrumentsthat are direct obligations of the United States and which, at maturity,will equal the aggregate amount of principal on the obligations of theFunding Corporation. The banks are also required to pay the administrativeexpenses, including custodian fees, of the Funding Corporation. To theextent that the Funding Corporation has not obtained funds sufficient topay the interest due on its obligations from first, the earnings on certainassets of the Funding Corporation and, second, proceeds from the RTC, thebanks shall pay each calendar year a certain amount to the Funding Corporation,less the amounts required in such year by the Financing Corporation, charteredpursuant to section 21 of the Act, and the Funding Corporation PrincipalFund, to pay such interest expenses. To the extent the foregoing amountsare insufficient to cover interest payments, the FSLIC Resolution Fundshall transfer to the Funding Corporation any net proceeds from the saleof assets received from the RTC. Finally, the Secretary of the Treasuryshall pay to the Funding Corporation such amounts necessary to cover anyremaining shortfalls in interest payments.<ITAG tagnum="84">B. Administrative Expenses Assessments for the Funding Corporation</ITAG>Pursuant to new section 21B of the Act, the banks are required to pay theadministrative expenses, including custodian fees, of the Funding Corporation.Each bank is required to pay an amount determined by multiplying the totaladministrative expenses for any period by the percentage calculated bydividing_ (i) The aggregate amount each bank is required to invest in the FundingCorporation pursuant to sections 21B(e) (4) and (5) of the Act; by, (ii) The aggregate amount the Board has required all banks to invest asof the date of the determination under such sections. This determination will not take into account amounts invested in the FundingCorporation by certain banks pursuant to section 21B(e)(6) of the Act fora bank whose investment was in excess of the limitation set forth in section21B(e)(3) of the Act. In order for the banks to be able to budget for anticipated administrativeexpenses, including custodian fees, the regulations enacted today providethat, on an annual basis, the banks will receive, from the Directorate,an approved budget of the Funding Corporation, detailing such expenses.Further, the Directorate will perform the calculation, based upon a methodapproved by the Board, and in accordance with section 21B(c)(7) of theAct, of each bank's pro rata share and will collect such expenses fromthe banks. Each bank will be required to forward its pro rata share ofsuch expenses within ten (10) business days after receipt of notice fromthe Directorate of its pro rata share. Section 21B provides that the Funding Corporation shall have no paid employees.However, the statute authorizes the Directorate, with the approval of theFederal Housing Finance Board, to authorize the officers, employees, oragents of the banks to act on behalf of the Funding Corporation. <ITAG tagnum="84">C. Assessments of the Federal Home Loan Banks for the Funding Corporation</ITAG>The regulations promulgated today clarify the manner in which the bankswill be assessed in order to capitalize the Funding Corporation, and therebyfund the Funding Corporation Principal Fund, and also clarify the mannerin which the banks will be assessed for interest payments on the outstandingobligations of the Funding Corporation when certain other sources of fundshave been exhausted. Pursuant to the regulations promulgated today, theDirectorate will coordinate the assessment of the banks. Such coordinationwill require receipt of earnings projections from the banks and fundingprojections from the Directorate, reviewed by the Board. On the basis ofthese projections, the Directorate shall calculate the amount of availablebank funds and forward such calculation to the banks. Thereafter, the Directorateshall advise the banks at least fifteen (15) days in advance of the duedate of the amount of funds actually required by the Funding Corporation.In calculating the limit pursuant to sections 21B(e)(3) (B) and (C) ofthe Act, if the amount invested in the Financing Corporation and the FundingCorporation exceeds $300,000,000 in the aggregate in any one year, theexcess amount shall be credited in the following year or years, as thecase may be. The Financing Corporation and the Funding Corporation shallcoordinate the capital contribution demands of the respective entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">D. Establishment, Maintenance and Funding of Reserve Accounts </ITAG>The amount of any bank's allocation of the funds required to be providedto capitalize the Funding Corporation may exceed the maximum amount limitationapplicable to such bank under section 21B(e)(3) of the Act. In such instances,such bank will become a ``deficient bank'' and the ``remaining banks''will be required to pay, in addition to the amount required under section21B(e)(5) of the Act, a prorated portion of the deficient bank's excessamount. A remaining bank's prorated portion of the excess amount will beincluded in the maximum amount limitation for that bank under section 21B(e)(3)of the Act so that a remaining bank will not also become a deficient bankbecause of its contribution on behalf of a deficient bank. Banks may alsobecome deficient through the payment of interest expenses, and the regulationsprovide a mechanism for the payment of such deficiencies. The regulations promulgated today also clarify that a bank which becomesdeficient, with respect to interest payments or capital contributions,is required to set funds aside in separate reserve accounts, availableonly to reimburse the remaining banks for investments or interest paymentsmade on behalf of the deficient bank. A deficient bank must set aside,on a quarterly basis, in the aggregate, twenty percent (20%) of its netearnings (as defined in section 21B(k)(6) of the Act) in any year, or theamount of the deficiency if such deficiency is less than twenty percent(20%) of its net earnings. Such amounts will continue to be set aside eachquarter until such deficiency is repaid. Interest shall begin to accruetwo (2) years after the investments under section 21B(e)(6) of the Actare made on behalf of a deficient bank. Finally, the Directorate is todirect the disbursement of funds set aside in the reserve accounts to theremaining banks on an annual basis. <ITAG tagnum="84">E. Industry Assessments </ITAG>In addition to bank contributions through the purchase of Funding Corporationstock, in order to obtain additional funding  for the Funding CorporationPrincipal Fund, section 21B authorizes the Funding Corporation, with theapproval of the Board of Directors of the FDIC, to collect assessmentsfrom Savings Association Insurance Fund (``SAIF'') members. Such assessmentsmay be in an amount up to the maximum amount which may be assessed againstSAIF members under section 7 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended,12 U.S.C. 1811, <T3>et seq., </T3>(``FDIA''). However, in making such assessments, theFunding Corporation must deduct from the maximum assessment allowed, theamount of an assessment which may be made by the Financing Corporationwhich has first priority on all such assessments.To the extent that capital contributions from the banks and industry assessmentsare insufficient to capitalize the Funding Corporation Principal Fund,the Directorate shall request that the FDIC transfer funds to the FundingCorporation representing proceeds from liquidating dividends and paymentsmade on claims received by the FSLIC Resolution Fund, established pursuantto section 11A of the FDIA, from receiverships. <ITAG tagnum="84">F. Authorization of Establishment of lnvestment Policies and Procedures</ITAG>The regulations authorize the Directorate with Board approval to establishinvestment policies and procedures from time to time with respect to assetsof the Funding Corporation which are not required to be transferred tothe RTC. Such policies and procedures are to be consistent with the provisionsof section 21B(g) of the Act. <ITAG tagnum="84">G. Federal Reserve Banks as Depositaries and Fiscal Agents </ITAG>The regulations provide that the Federal Reserve banks are to be used asdepositaries, fiscal agents and custodians of the Funding Corporation.<ITAG tagnum="84">H. Book-Entry Procedures </ITAG>The Funding Corporation is authorized pursuant to section 21B(f) of theAct to issue bonds, notes, debentures, and similar obligations. These regulationsestablish book-entry procedures for the obligations issued by the ResolutionFunding Corporation. This part provides that the Federal Reserve banksmay issue, service and maintain Resolution Funding Corporation obligationsin book-entry form. In addition, this part sets forth the book-entry proceduresincluding the transfer, pledge, and servicing of book-entry Funding Corporationobligations. <ITAG tagnum="84">I. Procedural Requirements </ITAG>The Board is adopting these regulations as a final rule effective September21, 1989. The Board finds that, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B) and (d)(3),notice and public procedure and a delayed effective date are impracticable,unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest. The Board finds that it is in the public interest for the Funding Corporationto be able to issue its obligations at the earliest possible opportunityand that the Funding Corporation will be unable to commence its operationsuntil these operational rules are adopted. In connection with this finding,the Board notes that funds raised by the Funding Corporation will be transferredto the RTC to resolve cases, pursuant to section 21A of the Act, involvingdepository institutions previously insured by the Federal Savings and LoanInsurance Corporation (``FSLIC'') and placed into conservatorship or receivershipbetween January 1, 1989, and the date of enactment of the FIRREA, and thethree-year period beginning on the date of enactment. The Funding Corporation'stransfer of funds to the RTC will permit the maintenance of public confidencein the nation's depository institutions and will enable the RTC to meetits responsibilities under the Act. Accordingly, the Board finds that itis contrary to the public interest to delay the adoption of the rules inorder to provide for such notice and public procedure. Moreover, the Board is of the view that notice and public procedure areunnecessary, because the rules set forth in part 1510 generally only codifythe statutory rules already applicable under section 21B of the Act. Therefore,the new rules impose no new legal burden on insured institutions or thebanks. Similarly, providing notice and public procedure and a delayed effectivedate would be contrary to the public interest because the Board could notimmediately discharge its statutory responsibilities. Finally, the Board finds that these regulations relate to agency organization,procedure, or practice within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 553, and are thereforeexempt from notice and public procedure provisions pursuant to 5 U.S.C.553(a)(2). Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required for these regulations,the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>) do not apply. Similarly, it has been determined thatthese regulations do not constitute a major rule for purposes of ExecutiveOrder 12291. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Parts 1510 and 1511 </ITAG>Federal home loan banks, Federal Reserve System, Financing Corporation,Resolution Funding Corporation, Resolution Trust Corporation, Securities.Accordingly, the Board hereby amends title 12, chapter XV, Code of FederalRegulations, as set forth below.
