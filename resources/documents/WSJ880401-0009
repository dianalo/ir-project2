Lemasters, its former president and chief executive officer, a compensation package that includes $275,000 a year for the rest of his life in exchange for his agreeing to leave the company.    The compensation, which also includes generous medical and life insurance benefits, was offered last year as an inducement to spur Mr. Lemasters's departure after the collapse of Atlanta-based Contel's plan to merge with Washington-based Communications Satellite Corp.    In a proxy statement being mailed to shareholders this week, Contel disclosed that it agreed to make biweekly payments to Mr. Lemasters of $28,846 -- a rate of about $750,000 a year -- from his departure on April 30, 1987, until July 29, 1988. The agreement ended an employment contract between Mr. Lemasters and Contel.    The telecommunications company also said it would continue to provide &quot;other miscellaneous compensation&quot; through Aug. 3, and that Mr. Lemasters would provide consulting and other services until then.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Contel's stock closed at $33.25, up 25 cents.    Mr. Lemasters, 53 years old, left after an apparent dispute with Contel's chairman and founder, Charles Wohlstetter, and currently works at a Florida-based computer company. He couldn't be reached for comment.    At the time of Mr. Lemasters's departure, Mr. Wohlstetter, 77, cited &quot;differences in both management philosophy and operating policy between Mr. Lemasters and the board.&quot; A Contel spokesman declined to elaborate on the circumstances.    Beginning Sept. 1, Mr. Lemasters will receive $275,000 a year under what the company calls a &quot;senior executive supplemental income plan.&quot; He also will receive his vested benefits under various company plans and lifetime medical and life insurance coverage.    Contel said a special fund was established to cover Mr. Lemasters's compensation, which was reflected in 1987 results. The company, however, didn't specify the total set aside.    Contel profits plunged last year to $43 million, or 55 cents a share, from $234 million, or $3.02 a share, in 1986. The results reflected a restructuring program that Contel initiated after Mr. Lemasters's departure and after it scrapped the plans to merge with Comsat.    The proxy material also disclosed that other Contel executives received sharply lower compensation in 1987 as lower profits slashed their incentive packages. Although Mr. Wohlstetter's base salary remained at $615,967 in 1987, his incentive bonuses were only $77,500, compared with $565,901 in 1986. </TEXT></DOC>
