A vegetation map derived from a combination of onsite surveillanceand remotely sensed imagery is also provided as part of this report.Through January 1988, 13 wildlife species of special interest to stateand federal agencies, in addition to ducks and geese, were observed onthe proposed expansion area. Then raptorial bird species were observedin the area, including bald eagles, golden eagles, and prairie falcons.Upland game bird species, such as sage grouse, California quail, chuckars,and gray (Hungarian) partridge were present. Loggerhead shrikes, a speciesof special interest, were also observed on the site. Estimates of waterfowlabundance are included for the Priest Rapids Pool of the Columbia River,which includes the proposed river crossing sites. The number of waterfowlon the proposed crossing areas were comparatively low during the winterof 1986 to 1987 and high in 1987 to 1988. Bald eagles ad common loonswere observed on the crossing areas. Six small mammal species were capturedduring this study period; one, the sagebrush vole, is a species of specialinterest. Two large animal species, mule deer and elk, were noted onthe site. Beaver were the only furbearig animals noted to date. Rainbowtrout were the only fish species collected within the proposed northernexpansion area. The distribution of fall chinook salmon spawning areaswas documented within the proposed river crossing areas. 3 refs., 7 figs.,3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
