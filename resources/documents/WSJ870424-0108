The reason is rising interest rates, which have sent bond prices skidding the past month. Many big fund groups, including Fidelity Investments, Vanguard Group of Investment Cos. and T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. report outflows in recent days, particularly from municipal bond and some long-term government bond funds. Some of the money has apparently been moving into money market and other short-term funds, where yields are picking up as overall returns falter on long-term bonds. Money market fund assets rose $1.63 billion to a near-record $238.77 billion in the week ended Wednesday.    A flight from long bonds could leave much at stake for both the underlying credit markets -- where mutual funds are big customers -- and for the fund industry itself, which has enjoyed much of its stupendous growth in recent years from fixed-income products.    Assets of bond and income funds totaled nearly $300 billion at the end of February, with about 700 such funds available to investors. In addition, 75% to 80% of all new fund sales the past two years have been in the fixed-income area, according to the Investment Company Institute, an industry trade group.    So far, fund groups say they haven't had any trouble meeting redemptions and they are taking pains to let investors know that.    &quot;We sold bonds to meet redemptions and we sold as many bonds as we wanted to,&quot; says Ian A. MacKinnon, Vanguard senior vice president. &quot;We have ample liquidity to meet redemptions.&quot; The firm adds that &quot;most people are staying.&quot;    The net asset values of Vanguard's longer-term municipal bond funds have dropped 5% to 8% since the end of March, in line with other large mutual funds, as the underlying bond prices plummeted. Performance of several of the largest long-term government bond funds slid 2% to 6% during the same period.    What the funds want to avert is panic selling that can act like gasoline on fire. If investors rush to redeem their shares in a down market, portfolio managers are forced to sell securities, potentially accelerating losses for shareholders left behind. Funds can ask the Securities and Exchange Commission to let them suspend redemptions in extreme situations.    Regulators say they're watching the area but so far have concluded that although markets were erratic, there hasn't been an emergency that would cause them to suspend redemptions. Such suspensions are rare because the overriding regulatory sentiment is that investors should be able to redeem shares at will.    Part of the reason for deeper drops in municipal bonds is that the market is more diverse and less liquid than, say, long-term government bonds or stocks. &quot;If somebody's dumping a large number of munis, the (prices) are immediately discounted,&quot; a fund executive says.    &quot;We're very concerned about our shareholders' view of the marketplace,&quot; Mr. MacKinnon says. Although the fine print of mutual funds' prospectuses has repeatedly warned about bond market volatility, many small investors haven't fully understood that a run-up in interest rates can hurt the value of their principal. Still, Mr. MacKinnon argues that higher rates have a few benefits to investors, too, &quot;since their dividends are being reinvested at higher yields.&quot;    At T. Rowe Price, exchanges out of all tax-free funds this month amount to 5% to 6% of total assets, an amount thought to be in line with the industry average. The firm is maintaining a cash position of about 10% in these funds, to cover any pending redemptions. This month the only T. Rowe Price bond fund with a cash inflow is the international bond fund.    Fidelity says that in the past week or two, the most discernible inflows have been in money market, international equity funds and gold funds. Redemption patterns early in the month were clouded by investors raising cash to pay their taxes.    &quot;We're telling people we think the bond market's turned the corner and we're probably no longer in a bull bond market,&quot; a T. Rowe Price spokesman says after the head of the firm's municipal bond division briefed telephone sales employees this week.    Investors with a low tolerance for risk are being told they should consider moving into money market funds or intermediate bond funds. That's a view T. Rowe Price has had since the end of 1986. In its 1987 outlook mailing, it advised conservative investors to consider the shorter-term funds in light of its view that interest rates would rise modestly and inflation could reach 4% to 5% this year.    A critical issue for investors is recognizing the difference between a bond fund's yield and its total return. The total return is a combination of interest rate income and changes in the prices of the bonds. Buying any long-maturity bond fund carries a risk that interest rates will rise and bond prices will fall, producing losses in principal value that can offset part or all of yield income.    Many funds have been emphasizing yield rather than total return, and some fund-watchers say the full picture is starting to sink in for investors.    &quot;Households have focused on the high current return while ignoring the substantial principal risk involved,&quot; says Michael Goldstein, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co. Mr. Goldstein notes in a recent industry report that funds capitalized on declining interest rates by pitching bond funds to investors and now face a declining growth period as interest rates rise. He expects industry asset growth to slow to 18% to 20% over the next five years from 40% in the past two years.    Still, Mr. Goldstein doesn't expect investors to run for the exits all at once. &quot;If I had to bet I think they wouldn't bail out immediately. But you won't see any new inflows and eventually the industry will slow down.&quot;    Some of the most severe price drops in recent days have been in zero-coupon bond funds. Zero-coupon bonds don't have a coupon, or periodic interest payment; instead they pay investors all their accrued interest when the bond matures, somewhat like a savings bond. Such bonds have traditionally been among the most volatile.    Benham Target funds, a series of six zero-coupon bond funds that range from 1990 maturity to 2015 maturity, reports redemptions in all funds in recent weeks.    &quot;The nervous money moved out and the ones who stayed in are the (long-term investors) we like,&quot; says John Schniedwind, who manages the Benham Target portfolios. He says he has &quot;been putting in 10, 11, 12 hour days&quot; shopping for the best prices and briefing phone representatives. Last week the Palo Alto, Calif.-based firm sent junior portfolio assistants downstairs at its offices to help answer the cascading investor questions.    In general, funds say they're coping with turbulent markets that they expect will persist. &quot;The volatility isn't going to be over until people are confident about our relationship with Japan, with the exchange rate of the yen to the dollar and until they have some sense of predictability of government policy,&quot; says Donald Farrar, head of research at Benham Target.    Ironically, a new long-term government income fund barreled into the market just days before interest rates started to climb. It raised an astounding $2.5 billion in three weeks, partly because of a marketing maelstrom.    The fund, MetLife-State Street Government Income Fund, is sold through brokers and financial planners. The fund is no-load, or without a sales charge to investors -- a pricing structure that brokers normally don't touch, because there isn't any commission incentive. But in this case brokers and financial planners are selling the product and receiving a commission advanced by Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. The insurance firm plans to recoup the costs over several years out of the fund's so-called 12b-1 fee. Such fees allow funds to dip into fund assets to cover certain marketing costs.    The fund is down about 3% since it began trading March 23. Considering the state of the long-term bond market, the fund is temporarily invested in much shorter-maturity instruments -- a defensive strategy that many bond fund managers have adopted recently.    &quot;The goal is to have it 50-50 between Treasurys and Ginnie Maes,&quot; says David McLean, president of the fund and MetLife-State Street Investment Services Inc. For now, though, the fund holds a mix of securities that are performing about in line with a three-year Treasury issue.    ---   Today's edition marks the expansion of the Mutual Funds/Managed Investing column to twice a week.
