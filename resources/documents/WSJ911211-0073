Underwriters led by Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. sold 60 millionshares of the Toledo, Ohio, glass company at $11 apiece. The$660 million offering amounts to one of the year's largestnew stock issues. But it was completed at a significantlylower price than originally hoped for by Owens-Illinois andits largest shareholder, the leveraged buy-out firm ofKohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co.</LP><TEXT>   In October, Owens-Illinois filed plans to go public, about4 1/2 years after being taken private in a leveraged buy-outled by KKR. In its preliminary prospectus, Owens-Illinoissaid it aimed to sell stock within a range of $13 to $16 ashare. Analysts and the company's own financial models hadassumed the stock would be sold at the midpoint of $14.50 ashare.   However, since that original filing, the stock market &quot;hasbeen a little skittish,&quot; said Kidder Peabody andamp; Co. analystJoseph Stivaletti. The Dow Jones Industrial Average hasdropped nearly 200 points, or about 7%.   Prices of some recent new issues have been marked downeven more. Stop andamp; Shop Cos., for example, anotherKKR-controlled company that had originally planned to gopublic at $14 to $16 a share, ended up selling stock at$12.50 a share instead.   Owens-Illinois has been counting on proceeds from thestock issue to help finance a major overhaul of its balancesheet. The company this week is expected to sell $1 billionof junk bonds yielding 10% to 11%. Proceeds from both theequity sale and the new bond offering will be used to reducemuch higher-cost debt -- some with an interest coupon of 141/2% or more.   As of Sept. 30, Owens-Illinois had $3.99 billion of debton its books. For the first nine months of 1991, the companyhad earnings before interest and taxes of $452.9 million onsales of $2.73 billion, but it had net income from continuingoperations of just $20.9 million, or 57 cents a share, asdebt service consumed most of its operating profit.   With the stock offering, various partnerships controlledby KKR end up holding less than 35% of Owens-Illinois, downfrom about 90% before the offering. KKR still holds six ofnine board seats at the company.   Several analysts said investors may have shied away fromOwens-Illinois's stock offering at the originally proposedprice because of concern about the company's liability invarious asbestos-related suits. In its prospectus,Owens-Illinois disclosed that its main insurance coveragefrom Aetna Life andamp; Casualty Co. will be exhausted some timenext year.   Kidder Peabody's Mr. Stivaletti said Owens-Illinois hasrecently been settling asbestos claims for about $3,000 acase. With some 75,000 cases pending against the company, theprobable costs of asbestos settlements are $225 million &quot;andlikely lower,&quot; said Maeda Klein, an analyst at Donaldson,Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp.</TEXT></DOC>
