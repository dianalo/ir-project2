<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-13-0323 </DOCNO><TEXT>A third-derivative molecular absorption spectrophotometric procedure isdescribed for the determination of trace amounts of praseodymium (Pr).The procedure is based on the reaction of praseodymium with BromopyrogallolRed (BPR) in acetate-buffered medium. The influence of various instrumentalparameters and reaction conditions on the colour development of the BPR-Prcomplex has been investigated. The proposed method is free of interferencefrom up to 100-fold amounts of other rare earth elements (except yttrium,lanthanum and neodymium). In conjunction with ion-exchange separation,the proposed method has been applied to the determination of praseodymiumin aluminium metal samples.</TEXT></DOC>
