Acting Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Mohammed Besharati made theannouncement as Syria and Iran disagreed on ways to end 13 days ofcombat that has killed 243 people and wounded 762.   ``The case of kidnapping (foreigners) in Lebanon is part of thecrisis which Lebanon is passing through. I believe that if we couldend the state of war currently prevailing, then definitely theother case would be solved too,'' Besharati said without furtherelaboration.   Besharati has been mediating an end to the bloody disputebetween the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, and thepro-Syrian Amal, Arabic for hope.   The Iranian envoy made the statement on the foreign hostages inresponse to reporters' questions after a meeting with actingLebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss.   Most of the hostages, including nine Americans, are believedheld by Hezbollah-affiliated Shiite zealots based in the16-square-mile slums of south Beirut, where fighting has beenraging since May 6.   Syria on Sunday massed 7,500 troops and 500 tanks and armoredvehicles on the southern, western and northern edges of southBeirut and its officers said the army was prepared to move in toquell the fighting.   Asked whether the Syrians would deploy in south Beirut,Besharati said: ``It is neither in Syria's interest to deploy insouth Beirut nor does the whole population want Syria to entersouth Beirut.''   Asked on whether his efforts would lead Syria to reverse itsdecision to move into south Beirut, Besharati said: ``Certainly itwould lead to this.''   But Syrian Defense Minister Mustafa Tlass, who made anunscheduled visit to Beirut Wednesday, said the Syrian deploymentin south Beirut was ``imperative.''   ``Entering the suburb is imperative. The suburb is militarilyfallen, we have ringed it from all sides. Let all the Lebanese be(reassured),'' Tlass told reporters. He did not elaborate on theremark.   Besharati said Iran was proposing the ``formation of a force topreserve security'' in the bomb-ravaged slums after arranging asolid cease-fire.   Eight cease-fire accords have collapsed since the fighting brokeout. Each side blamed the other for violating them.   Asked if the Syrians would be represented in this force,Besharati said: ``We and our Syrian brothers would guarantee thisforce.''   But the chief of Syria's military intelligence in Lebanon, Brig.Gen. Ghazi Kenaan, said Besharati's efforts to arrange a politicalsettlement were not succeeding.   ``We are giving political efforts a chance to solve the problemand stop the bleeding in south Beirut,'' Kenaan said after ameeting with Besharati. ``But it seems that this effort is notleading to a tangible outcome.''   He said Syria had made the decision to storm south Beirut and``it awaits nothing but implementation.''   Contradicting Besharati's remarks, Kenaan said: ``The populationhas requested the deployment of the Syrian forces to end theirordeal. We cannot but meet the people's pleas.''   Amal leader Nabih Berri also called for the deployment of Syriantroops in south Beirut.   ``Amal believes that a sisterly security force regarded as afriend to both sides should deploy in south Beirut to protect thepeople,'' Berri said after a one-hour session with Besharati.   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, is Iran's main Arabally in the war with Iraq.   Syria, however, recently has been alarmed by Iran's efforts todispute its role in Lebanon by trying to dominate the 1.2 millionShiites, the nation's largest sect, through Hezbollah.   The Iranian Embassy said Besharati would meet Lebanon'sParliament Speaker Hussein Husseini, a Shiite, on Thursday.   Lebanese security sources said Besharati was meeting Lebaneseofficials to seek support for an Iranian proposal to end theinter-Shiite clashes.   One source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Iranianenvoy proposed a compromise in which Syria would deploy troops onlyin the northern districts of the slums, where Amal still holdspositions after being dislodged from 90 percent of the contestedterrain.</TEXT></DOC>
