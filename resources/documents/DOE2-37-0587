The authors evaluatedthe MR findings in 16 cases of Chiari Type I malformation, 43 cases ofType II, and two cases of a basilar impression (BI) with an atlantoaxialdislocation (AAD). T/sub 1/ and proton density-weighted (spin echo withshort repetition and echo times) sagittal and coronal images were usefulin evaluating the grade of the downward herniation of posterior fossastructures and the accompanying anomalies. A downward herniation of cerebellartonsil was the main characteristic finding in the Chiari Type I malformations.On the contrary, there was a downward herniation of the cerebellar vermisand tonsil and of the brainstem, in addition to the presence of manyother brain anomalies and hydrocephalus, in the Chiari Type II malformations.A quantitative analysis was made by introducing some index points - theC/sub 1/-line, the foramen magnus, the midbrain-pontine junction, theponto-medullary junction, and the fastigium point - in Chiari malformations.The study disclosed an enlargement of the foramen magnum and a low positionof each index point. The herniation of posterior fossa structures wasespecially more marked in symptomatic than in asymptomatic cases of theChiari Type II anomaly. In basilar impression MRI provides satisfactoryinformation for planning surgical treatment.</TEXT></DOC>
