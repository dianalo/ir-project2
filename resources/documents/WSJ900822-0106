Griesa</HL><DATE>08/22/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A7</SO><LP>   Readers should not be put off by the title, &quot;Why Blacks,Women, and Jews Are Not Mentioned in the Constitution, andOther Unorthodox Views&quot; (American Enterprise Institute,Washington, D.C., 182 pages, $16.95), by Robert A. Goldwin.The book is not racist, sexist, anti-Semitic, flippant orstrident. Mr. Goldwin was the primary organizer of thedecade-long Constitution Project of the American EnterpriseInstitute, where he is a resident scholar. He is basically aphilosopher with a deep interest in what he calls the&quot;American founding principles.&quot; This book is a collection ofhis articles and addresses dealing with a variety ofsubjects, including the Constitution, American education andthe proposed Law of the Sea Treaty. His ideas areventuresome, and inevitably of the kind to provoke debate.Many points are of enormous value, but in the debate aboutsome, I would be on the opposing team.   The essay from which the book's title is drawn deals inpart with the ever-recurring attack on the authors of theConstitution for not immediately putting an end to slavery.During the recent 200th anniversary, some commentators spokewith particular bitterness of the provision (Art. I, Sec. 2)that a state's allotment of members in the House shall bedetermined by the number of &quot;free Persons&quot; plus &quot;three-fifthsof all other Persons&quot; (meaning slaves). The Founding Fathers,it is said, viewed the Negro slave as less than human andexpressed this in cold arithmetic.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Goldwin's thesis is sharply different. He argues thatthe three-fifths clause had nothing to do with characterizingblacks in demeaning terms. The issue was not the relativeworth of individuals but the relative power of Northern andSouthern states in Congress. The Southern states were theones who argued for counting the full number of slaves on anequal basis with the whites. It was the delegates from theNorthern states who wanted to count the slaves as less thanthe whites, and indeed urged that they should not be countedat all. A compromise was reached in the three-fifthsprovision.   Although the subject of slavery was dealt with in theConstitution, the word &quot;slave&quot; or &quot;slavery&quot; was neveractually used. There was nothing in the Constitution thatperpetuated slavery, and when abolition finally came, it wasthe laws and practices of certain states that needed to bechanged, not the Constitution.   A number of other interesting themes are pursued in theauthor's remaining essays on the Constitution. He contraststhe extravagant catalog of &quot;human rights&quot; appearing in manymodern constitutions with the brief list of basics in ourBill of Rights. The current tendency is to guarantee suchthings as adequate diet, housing, health care, recreation andculture. But these &quot;guarantees&quot; are usually fraud or folly.For people dying of malnutrition, the question is not whetherthey have the right, but how to get food to them.   Mr. Goldwin ponders with great insight the reasons for theAmerican Constitution's success and longevity. By now about160 other countries have such governing instruments, buttheir replacement rate is very high. The AmericanConstitution (capital &quot;C&quot;) was drafted to correspond with theAmerican constitution (small &quot;c&quot;), meaning the people'scharacter, habits and institutions. Americans had accumulatedconsiderable experience in selfgovernment going back to thecreation of the Virginia House of Burgesses in 1619. Thus ourConstitution, unlike so many documents of the present era,established a system that the people were ready -- and wereresolved -- to put into practice.   In essays equally trenchant regarding the modern politicalscene, Mr. Goldwin constructs the arguments that formed hisadvice to the Reagan administration on the proposed Law ofthe Sea Treaty -- intellectual underpinning that helped toforestall the creation of a large and wasteful internationalbureaucracy dealing with minerals in the deep seabed.   There is, however, one aspect of the book in which Mr.Goldwin carries his unorthodoxy too far. The problem isepitomized by his statement that James Madison, whosewritings in The Federalist are an important guide tointerpreting the Constitution, did &quot;not rely on discipline oreducation or religion or any form of good motives to controlgovernment officials.&quot; The author repeatedly cites Madison'sFederalist 51 to support the proposition that the onlyreliable device for keeping government within proper boundsis self-interest combating self-interest. &quot;Ambition must bemade to counteract ambition.&quot; But Mr. Goldwin's thesis hasbeen developed at the expense of a fair use of the sources.Madison and the other Founders were not Chicago-schooleconomists. They knew about self interest, but The Federalistresounds with the basic moral necessities for government: theneed for &quot;patriotism and love of justice,&quot; and for thesacrifice of &quot;partial interests to the public good.&quot; Theremust be a &quot;sacred reverence . . . in the breast of the rulerstowards the Constitution.&quot; In Madison's view, &quot;Republicangovernment presupposes the existence of these qualities in ahigher degree than any other form.&quot; Platitudes? Not to theFounders, nor to those who respect them.   ---   Judge Griesa sits on the U.S. District Court in New YorkCity.</TEXT></DOC>
