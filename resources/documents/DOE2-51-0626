Theexplosion-proof sheet was made by sewing felt or high tension nets tothe film materials made of extremely highly tensional and flexible alamid-basedor polyethylene-based fibers. In this experiment, the sheet of the alamidfiber film material was used. As a result, it was elucidated that thedisplacement of one sheet of the explosion-proof sheet agreed approximatelywith its behavior calculated by the proposed formula. However, in theactual conditions, several explosion-proof sheets are tightly fastenedwith ropes or magic tapes, etc. for use and receive flying stones inaddition to blast waves. Consequently, it is necessary to conduct a comprehensivestudy in the future through demonstration experiments concerning theactual use of the explosion-proof sheet and accumulation of the dataconcerned.
