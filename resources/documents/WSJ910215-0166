Cornwell in an acclaimed 1990 debutnovel, returns to her grisly rounds with &quot;Body of Evidence&quot;(Scribners, 387 pages, $18.95).   Scarpetta, based in Richmond, Va., is confronted this timewith the vicious stabbing death of Beryl Madison, a33-year-old author of romance fiction. Madison, protegee of acelebrated but nonprolific and highly reclusive novelistnamed Cary Harper, had recently fled to Key West, Fla., afterbeing harassed by threatening messages. But Beryl had chosento return to her home in Richmond, where she was murderedalmost as soon as she walked in the door.</LP><TEXT>   What had prompted such a frenzied attack? Did it haveanything to do with the nonfiction manuscript (sincedisappeared) that Madison had been working on, a memoir thatmight have revealed unpleasant facts about her relationshipwith the secretive Cary Harper?   It's the police's job, not Kay Scarpetta's, to track downthe killer. But the conscientious doctor can't help becomingemotionally involved with the victims she encounters, andthis leads to her increased participation in investigations.Her most frequent official companion is Lt. Pete Marino, aboorish but protective sort who dismisses most citizens as&quot;drones.&quot;   Before Dr. Scarpetta and her colleagues can make muchheadway with the Madison case, a second brutal murder occursand then another inexplicable death. Further complicatingmatters are a smooth-talking former flame of Scarpetta's, alawyer who pumps her for information about Beryl; and theex-flame's boss, a troublemaking publicity hound whorepresented Madison and who bears a grudge against Kay's ownsuperior, the attorney general.   There's a lot going on in &quot;Body of Evidence&quot; -- perhapstoo much. Serial killers, literary sharks and politicalrivals compete for space in an overcrowded plot. KayScarpetta, who herself starts receiving threats from theapparent murderer, doesn't always keep up as well as shemight. When the man out of her past seems to be somethingother than what he has claimed, the otherwise thorough doctorfails to respond effectively to the obvious danger signals.Later, when explanations are made, this character assumes theunreality of a figure from Beryl Madison's romance books.   But Dr. Scarpetta's second outing also has much to offer.Here, as in the first Scarpetta novel, &quot;Postmortem&quot; (new inAvon paperback, 327 pages, $3.95), Ms. Cornwell's prose is apleasure to read. Her clinical and procedural details havethe clink of truth. (A former crime reporter, Ms. Cornwellcurrently works as a computer analyst in the chief medicalexaminer's office in Virginia.) And it's heartening nowadaysto encounter a fictional woman investigator with anoccupation other than private eye.   Susan Isaacs, not exclusively a writer of mystery fiction,has put the detective story to good use before, notably inher engaging best seller, &quot;Compromising Positions.&quot; Now Ms.Isaacs has produced another amusing and effective murdermystery laced with romance: &quot;Magic Hour&quot; (HarperCollins, 400pages, $21.95).   Set in the Hamptons, &quot;Magic Hour&quot; begins with the poolsideshooting death of Seymour Ira &quot;Sy&quot; Spencer, multimillionairemovie producer, on location in Long Island with a troubledfilm. Spencer, it seems, was a charming manipulator, anemotional chameleon who could coldly take back tomorrow whathe'd so freely given yesterday.   Who might have wanted Sy dead? Lindsay Keefe, theice-princess screen star Spencer was reportedly about toreplace in mid-production? Mikey LoTriglio, the mob-connectedinvestor whose money Sy was maybe misappropriating? BonnieSpencer, the ex-wife Sy had cruelly led on, then publiclyhumiliated? Victor Santana, pretentious director, rival withSy for the chilly affections of Lindsay Keefe?   Looking into all this is homicide detective Steve Brady --Vietnam vet, recovering alcoholic and about-to-be husband.Despite his upcoming wedding, Brady becomes obsessed withsuspect Bonnie Spencer. For the longest time, he can't decidewhich he wants to do: fall in love with her, or book her formurder.   With its sharp characterizations and funny first-personnarration, &quot;Magic Hour&quot; is a mostly entertaining mix ofsuspense and infatuation. There are a few disclaimers worthmaking. Brady's complete suppression and then near-totalrecall of a crucial episode from his alcoholic years issimply unbelievable. And the hero's speech habits take somegetting used to. Ms. Isaacs seems to think vulgarity is anessential ingredient of a male cop's macho psyche.   Compensating for this is a parade of comic caricaturesthat combine the worst of both coasts. There's the productionassistant fresh out of film school, whose sole frame ofreference seems to be cinema. &quot;It wasn't one of thosecomfortable Gregory Peck silences . . .&quot; is how this fellowdescribes Sy Spencer's withdrawn mode. &quot;More brooding DeNiro-- if DeNiro was playing an Ivy League type.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
