Labor? OSHA's a creampuff, says David LeGrande, health and safety director of the Communications Workers of America. &quot;OSHA has almost been the Department of Commerce under the Reagan administration. Basically it's done nothing for workers.&quot;    Industry? OSHA is biased and punitive, complains William Haggett, chairman of Bath Iron Works Corp. He's smarting over a $4.2 million fine OSHA levied late last year against the company for alleged health and safety violations. The charges, he says, were &quot;replete with overstatements and exaggeration&quot; and &quot;just blew our minds.&quot;    Congress? OSHA is full of fumblers, many feel. Responding to a recent proposal for a new OSHA-type agency to deal specifically with the construction industry, Rep. Paul Henry, a Michigan Republican, says wearily: &quot;You'd still have the same bozos running it.&quot;    Who's right? In some respects, they all are -- but the blame doesn't rest on OSHA's shoulders alone. The agency has come under fire for doing too much -- or too little -- from the day its doors opened on Constitution Avenue 17 years ago. The reality is that OSHA's effectiveness has been pinched by budget and staff cuts and its grasp on business loosened by the Reagan administration's deregulatory shock troops.    And now, against a backdrop of national anxiety over the chemical nightmare of Bhopal, India, the agency confronts enormous new workplace health and safety challenges from new processses and products. Among these: a spate of hazardous chemicals and such evolving workplace technologies as video-display terminals and computer-chip production.    Some wonder if OSHA has enough resources -- and muscle -- for the job. Indeed, they argue that OSHA should be scuttled and replaced with a watchdog with sharper teeth. At the least, they say, local and state authorities should expand their regulatory powers.    Agency critics cite Pymm Thermometer Corp., a Brooklyn, N.Y., company where, they claim, OSHA knew of high levels of mercury for more than a decade, yet took no action. Last year, a New York jury found the company and two of its executives guilty in the mercury poisoning of a worker (but the judge set aside the verdict on jurisdictional grounds). OSHA officials conceded mishandling the case.    Still, &quot;we think we're firm but fair,&quot; insists John Pendergrass, President Reagan's third OSHA chief. He maintains the agency has used its power to correct problems in many workplaces, but he notes that according to federal law it's the employers responsibility to provide a safe workplace. &quot;The law doesn't say we're supposed to be the safety director of every plant.&quot;    The agency's reputation improved substantially during the recent two-year tenure of Labor Secretary William Brock. Under his direction, OSHA launched a campaign against some of the nation's biggest corporations, imposing a string of recordbreaking fines for failure to properly keep essential injury and illness records.    In one of his first actions, Mr. Brock (who subsequently left to run the ill-fated presidential campaign of Sen. Robert Dole) slammed Union Carbide Corp. with a $1.4 million fine and likened the plight of some of its employees to the canaries once used to sniff deadly gases in coal mines. (Union Carbide contested the fine and eventually settled for $408,500 without admitting guilt.)    For a time, the OSHA news releases rolled off the presses with regularity. The list of accused included some of the most prominent names in American business: Chrysler Corp., General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co., General Dynamics Corp. and Caterpillar Inc. In all, OSHA proposed a total $24.7 million in fines against companies for health and safety violations in fiscal 1987, an amount nearly five times the $5.5 million proposed in 1982. To date this fiscal year, more than $16 million in fines have been proposed.    But critics complain that the blitz of big fines, which generally are settled for half or less of the proposed amount, was a bombastic gimmick that did little to attack the root problems of workplace illness and injury. &quot;When you don't use criminal penalties, when you settle fines at a fraction of the dollar and when you have a policy that basically is an invitation to cheat, you certainly don't have vigorous enforcement of safety standards at the workplace,&quot; asserts Rep. Tom Lantos, a California Democrat who held hearings last year on safety conditions in the meatpacking industry.    OSHA later levied a $2.6 million fine against Occidental Petroleum Corp.'s IBP unit, charging that the nation's largest meatpacker deliberately concealed worker injuries and illnesses. (IBP has contested the case.)    The agency uses company-kept injury records to target inspections to work sites where injuries are most likely to occur, a system that Rep. Lantos contends provides irresponsible firms &quot;a premium for cheating,&quot; but that OSHA believes is the most effective use of its resources. OSHA officials also argue that totting up the dollar signs on fines obscures the agency's bigger accomplishments in getting companies to correct hazards that often involve many more worksites than the one cited -- a phenomenon Mr. Pendergrass calls &quot;the multiplier effect.&quot;    Richard Boggs, vice president of Organization Resources Counselors, a corporate consultant, agrees that &quot;more has been done for worker health and safety during the Reagan administration than the comparable eight years before.&quot; Last year, for instance, the agency issued a variety of rules governing farm-worker sanitation, grain dust, benzene and formaldehyde, covering more than 32 million workers.    But many rules came after years of legal pressure and court directives. And several were criticized as too weak, bolstering charges that the agency's regulating pace is glacially slow.    OSHA faces a far more pressing challenge, however. It must set more standards for exposure to hazardous chemicals and expand its inspection force, outsiders maintain. The recent spate of big fines &quot;was only the tip of the iceberg,&quot; argues Philip Landrigan, director of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine's environmental and occupational medicine division. He contends that there are &quot;serious overexposures to chemical substances occurring very commonly in workplaces across the country.&quot; Among these: excessive levels of silica exposure in 43% of U.S. ferrous foundries and excessive levels of lead in more than half the air samples OSHA has taken in New York factories.    New regulations aside, OSHA can't even enforce its current rules unless it increases its inspection force, Mr. Landrigan and others argue. OSHA currently has 1,125 inspectors, enough to inspect only about 2% of the nation's 3.4 million work forces covered by federal law.    OSHA officials argue that the agency does about 70,000 inspections annually -- twice as many as the IRS -- and increasing the staff may be prohibitively expensive. &quot;If we were to inspect every plant once a year, we'd have to have 125,000 inspectors at a cost of about $13.8 billion,&quot; says Mr. Pendergrass.    Budget cuts outside OSHA's control already have hobbled government safety research. Consider the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, the government's occupational research arm: Its budget this fiscal year was less than half {in 1980 dollars} what it was eight years ago, notes Dr. Landrigan, a former official there.    Yet OSHA's burden in the future is likely to grow more complex, as emerging technologies trigger new safety and health hazards. The new work force is losing manufacturing to technology jobs and includes growing numbers of women. Fears persist about possible health effects from video-display terminals, especially on jobs that require lots of repetitive hand motions, such as computer keying and grocery scanning.    Disorders of the hand, wrist, shoulder and back due to repetitive movements have reached &quot;epidemic proportions,&quot; says Deborah Berkowitz, health and safety director of the AFL-CIO's Food and Allied Service Trades division. She contends such problems afflict 25% of telephone workers, 60% of cashiers using grocery laser scanners, and nearly 50% of meatpackers. OSHA hasn't yet ruled on disorders such as carpal tunnel syndrome, a wrist disease, but the agency has addressed that problem by citing several companies under its &quot;general duty&quot; powers, including Kroger Corp., Chrysler Corp. and U S West Inc.'s Mountain Bell unit in Denver.    The Communications Workers union's Mr. LeGrande calls the situation at Mountain Bell &quot;truly catastrophic,&quot; with some directory-assistance operators becoming medically disabled from carpal tunnel syndrome. He says the company branded the cases &quot;mass hysteria.&quot;    For its part, Mountain Bell says its medical department has seen 140 employees from two Denver offices during the last two years who complained of repetitive motion symptoms, but that only &quot;a couple of dozen&quot; people continue to receive medical treatment. Officials say the number of symptoms in Denver compared with other offices is &quot;highly unusual.&quot;    A spokeswoman says the company's medical director had suggested &quot;there may be some mass psychological hysteria involved,&quot; and that other medical problems like obesity, arthritis and pregnancy could contribute to the reported symptoms. The company is &quot;rigorously&quot; contesting the OSHA citation.    The spotlight has turned, too, to chemicals used in the semiconductor industry. After a study last year found an unusual number of miscarriages among women employed at a semiconductor plant, some companies removed all pregnant women from computer-chip production jobs.    OSHA has begun considering a rule for solvents used in the electronics industry, but that process could take years. &quot;If the people at OSHA had ovaries they might do things a little differently,&quot; Eula Bingham, who ran OSHA under President Carter, complained at a recent meeting.    ---   Ms. Trost is a staff reporter in The Wall Street Journal's Washington bureau.    ---            The Largest Penalties in OSHA's History    Initially proposed penalties and settlements as of March 1, 1988                                                  PENALTY/                                                 SETTLEMENT                               REASON          (In thousands DATE       COMPANY            FOR PENALTY      of dollars) 2/11/88    Doe Run*           Safety/health   $2,780/                                violation        not settled 1/14/88    Kohler             Record keeping  $1,398/                                                 not settled 11/4/87    Bath Iron Works    Safety/health   $4,200/                                violation        not settled 10/22/87   TPMI/Macomber** #  Building        $2,475/                                collapse         not settled            Texstar                            $2,524/             Construction#                       not settled 9/25/87    Scott Paper        Record keeping  $813/$475 7/21/87    IBP##              Record keeping  $2,598/                                                 not settled 7/6/87     Chrysler           Safety/health   $1,576/             (Newark,           violation        not settled              Delaware) 11/5/86    Chrysler           Record keeping  $911/$285             (Belvidere,              Illinois) 4/1/86     Union Carbide      Record keeping  $1,378/$409 2/27/80    Newport News       Safety/health   $804/$121             Shipbuilding       violation *A joint venture of St. Joe Minerals and Homestake Mining **A joint venture of TPM International and George B.H.
