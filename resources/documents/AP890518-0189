To set up a taboois not a scientific decision. This is a value decision. I wouldstrongly advise setting up a taboo not to use any of this data,''Muller-Hill said.   While scientists should be asked their opinions on what shouldbe made taboo in research, Muller-Hill said ultimately the decisionshould be made by the public.   George Annas of Boston University School of Law and PublicHealth, also on the panel at the University of Minnesotaconference, agreed that the data should not be used. He cautionedabout similarities between Nazi research and research now beingconducted in the United States without prior consideration ofethical arguments.   ``The only time we take medical ethics seriously in the UnitedStates is when it doesn't matter, when the scientists can do theirresearch anyway,'' Annas maintained. ``The main view in science isto do the research first and worry about the ethics later.''   Annas predicted that within a decade scientists will have thecapability of testing an embryo and determining all of its geneticdefects as people decide whether to continue pregnancies.   Not only will tests be able to determine what diseases a personwill be born with, but also what diseases a person may developlater in life, he said.   ``Once we're able to do genetic manipulation at the embryolevel, we'll literally be able to manufacture the children wewant,'' Annas said.   Such capabilities must not be pursued in an ethical vacuum, hestressed.   ``I'd like to suggest that America's last frontier is morality,ethics. We have to decide what direction we're going. Our goalseems to be an antiseptic world in which we'll all live to be100,'' Annas said.   ``We are tarred by the Nazis. We can't get out of it until weconfront it. That really is our challenge,'' he added. ``I hopethis conference will provide impetus to some scientists to takevalues seriously.''   But Richard King, a professor with the University of Minnesota'sInstitute of Human Genetics, drew a distinction between Naziresearch and what is being done in the United States.   ``Many of the processes that went on in Germany are similar towhat we consider ethical medical practice in the United States,''King said. ``The major difference is that all of the geneticcommunity deals with genetics from an individual standpoint. We tryto use our information to educate individuals so they can makedecisions. We do not deal with genetics on a population scale.''   King said he believes current research should include a verystrong ethical component but not that ethical decisions should bemade before the research is done.   Arthur Caplan, director of the University of Minnesota Centerfor Biomedical Ethics, said Wednesday that renowned scientistsenabled the Third Reich to exterminate millions of people in WorldWar II by helping develop gas chambers and by propounding racisttheories.   Scientists, he said, ``were not dragged kicking and screamingand protesting'' into Nazism.</TEXT></DOC>
