Schmitt (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> BAC AIG </CO><IN> BNK ERN </IN><DATELINE> SAN FRANCISCO  </DATELINE><TEXT>   BankAmerica Corp. reported a 62% increase in first-quarter profit, modest but continuing proof that the once-troubled banking concern is on the mend.    BankAmerica reported net income of $109 million, or 56 cents a share, compared with $67 million, or 34 cents a share, a year earlier. More important, the bank reported higher earnings for the third consecutive quarter. As before, fewer loan problems and lower operating expenses were behind the improvement.    &quot;BankAmerica's solid performance in the first quarter clearly demonstrates that our recovery is continuing,&quot; said A.W. Clausen, chairman and chief executive officer.    The first-quarter results slightly exceeded Wall Street estimates. Analysts at several brokerage firms have started recommending the purchase of BankAmerica stock again. The stock has risen about 20% in the last two months, but some skeptical investors remain. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, BankAmerica closed at $10.50, unchanged, on fairly brisk volume of 1.3 million shares.    Yesterday, J. Richard Fredericks, bank analyst for Montgomery Securities, changed his purchase rating on the stock from negative to neutral. Mr. Fredericks said BankAmerica's basic earnings before taxes and provision for loan losses improved for the first time in several quarters.    In the first quarter, BankAmerica said loan write-offs were $92 million, down 70% from a year earlier and 28% below the fourth quarter. The bank took a separate $25 million charge from selling off a small portion of its Third World debt.    BankAmerica's slow-paying loans, an indication of future write-offs, also fell markedly. The company said non-accrual loans declined by $232 million -- or 6% -- from the level at year end. The decline would have been greater but the company reclassified $123 million in Panamanian debt during the quarter.    &quot;The improvement in credit quality is absolutely astounding,&quot; said Stephen Berman, bank analyst for County Securities USA. &quot;Most banks would be happy to get a $200 million reduction in non-accural loans in a year. Without Panama, they've done $350 million in a quarter.&quot;    BankAmerica is now writing off fewer of its problem loans than most other large banks. The development has left some analysts wondering whether the bank is being aggressive enough, especially considering its record of surprising loan problems over the past three years. But bank officials said they are being prudent. They said lower write-offs reflect previous housecleaning as well as more conservative lending practices. In addition, the bank has a beefed-up team of specialists who are having increasing success in recovering previously written-off loans.    BankAmerica also trimmed overhead. Its non-interest expense, including salaries, office space and equipment, fell about 10% from a year earlier. Excluding special factors, such costs fell about 3% from Dec. 31. The bank trimmed 1,500 positions during the quarter and is expected to trim 5,000 for the year. It employed 58,000 people at March 31.    Lower expenses helped to offset lower non-interest income, which was sharply reduced from the fourth quarter because of a winding down of asset sales by the bank. Compared with the fourth quarter, net interest income was about flat, excepting an accounting change. The spread between income from loans and the cost of funds grew to 3.66% from 3.62% in the fourth quarter.    BankAmerica also benefited from a doubling of profit at Seafirst Corp. The Seattle-based banking unit reported net income of $20.3 million, compared with $10.1 million a year earlier. Its profitability, as measured by return on assets, approximated a respectable 0.80%, compared with 0.51% for BankAmerica itself.    Seafirst also said it settled a dispute with American International Group's National Union Fire Insurance Co. unit. The settlement will result in a $46 million pretax gain for BankAmerica in the second quarter. The dispute stemmed from the refusal of National Union, formerly Seafirst's director and officer liability insurer, to pay for losses that Seafirst had from the Penn Square Bank collapse in 1982. </TEXT></DOC>
