A Black andamp; Decker spokeswoman said company officials and lawyers were waiting to review the American Standard-Kelso agreement before deciding whether to let a $73-a-share, or $2.33 billion, tender offer expire as scheduled at midnight tonight.    American Standard, a New York-based plumbing, air-conditioning and building products concern, had put itself up for auction after nearly two months of plotting strategies to stave off Black andamp; Decker. The Towson, Md.-based maker of power tools and household appliances launched an unsolicited tender offer in late January after trying repeatedly to meet with American Standard management to work out a friendly combination. Black andamp; Decker had since proposed raising its bid to $77 a share.    The acquisition is expected to be completed in about a month and is conditioned on, among other things, financing being obtained.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, American Standard closed at $76.375, up 87.5 cents. Black andamp; Decker's stock also reacted favorably, rising $1 to $19.50.    Analysts said it would be good for Black andamp; Decker to drop out of the contest now because an acquisition at the price offered by Kelso would dilute Black andamp; Decker's earnings for a year or so.    &quot;Management (of Black andamp; Decker) has been excellent so far,&quot; said Joel Krasner, an analyst with L.F.Rothschild. &quot;The acquisition is not economically justifiable anymore.&quot;    A merger, however, with Kelso, a closely held investment banking firm, will take American Standard out of the public arena, eliminating any need to report profits. &quot;That's a key to why Kelso could offer a higher price,&quot; said Charles Neuhauser, an analyst with Bear Stearns.    The agreement with Kelso was reached at an American Standard board meeting that began late Wednesday afternoon and lasted more than nine hours. Sources close to the negotiations said American Standard had supplied bidders with draft agreements, and the bidders filled in the blanks and amended the language before submitting their offers. American Standard refused to name any bidders other than Kelso, though company spokesmen had said other parties had expressed interest in acquiring the company.    Kelso's emergence as a white knight surprised many on Wall Street. Although several companies, including Wickes Cos. and Textron Inc., had been rumored to be interested in the role, none had expressed strong interest. Kelso apparently had been working on its offer since Feb. 24 when it signed a confidentiality agreement with American Standard.    Kelso's niche in the investment banking community is structuring leveraged buy-outs around employee stock ownership plans. The company's founder, Louis Kelso, believes that is a way to keep workers from putting their companies at a competitive disadvantage by pushing for higher and higher wages.    The centerpiece of the American Standard agreement, however, isn't an ESOP, though the accord provides for an ESOP to acquire a 20% stake.    American Standard said a syndicate led by Bankers Trust Co. has agreed to furnish $1.8 billion in financing, and First Boston Securities Co., a First Boston Co. affiliate, will provide a $900 million bridge loan. The company said the agreement envisions issuing so-called junk bonds to replace the bridge loan. Kelso would provide $250 million.    In its proposal to American Standard, Kelso said it figures the transaction would leave total debt of $2.7 billion and new common equity of $250 million.    In addition, Kelso said it is discussing with Emerson Electric Co. a $160 million investment Emerson planned to make to help finance American Standard's recapitalization plan. The St. Louis-based company agreed to provide the financing in exchange for certain debt securities and closer business ties that would help its air-conditioning compressor business. Emerson officials declined to comment.    Under the buy-out agreement, Kelso would receive a $25 million investment banking fee when the merger is completed. But if the agreement is terminated for certain reasons, Kelso would get $16 million.    While the agreement doesn't guarantee jobs for American Standard's management, Kelso's proposal was reassuring. The investment banker said it has &quot;a high regard for the current management,&quot; and that it anticipates &quot;adopting incentive compensation and other plans for management designed to provide additional incentives and rewards for successful performance.&quot;    American Standard directors met to consider the offers the same day the company was dealt a blow in federal court in Delaware. The court barred two takeover defenses aimed at thwarting Black andamp; Decker: an expansion of its severence plans for managers and changes in employee retirement and savings plans that provided accelerated payments. The decision freed an estimated $130 million, which Black andamp; Decker counted on to propose increasing its offer by $4 a share.    Arbitragers, who hold a majority of American Standard's shares outstanding, are poised to post big profits. When Black andamp; Decker announced its original $56-a-share tender offer in late January, American Standard had been trading around $34 a share. American Standard countered that offer with a &quot;poison pill&quot; and a recapitalization plan that spurred higher bids from Black andamp; Decker.    In all, the power-tool maker sweetened its offer four times, eventually reaching the $77-a-share offer it submitted to American Standard directors. Meanwhile, American Standard boosted the value of its recapitalization plan, finally pushing up the value of the cash-and-securities package to an estimated $73 to $74 a share. </TEXT></DOC>
