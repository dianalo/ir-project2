In a separate announcement, Philips said it intends to make aworldwide public stock offering of about 20 percent of the sharesin Polygram, the recording company that owns the classical musiclabel Deutsche Grammophon and represents pop performers such as BonJovi, Def Leppard, Dire Straits and the Robert Cray Band.   Philips said third-quarter operating income fell 16 percentbecause of a sharp drop in the price of its chips and computers,but that falloff was compensated for by lower interest payments andlower exchange-rate losses on loans.   Philips' consumer electronics and music businesses as well asdomestic appliances and personal-care products all grew healthily,the company said.   Philips' profit rose to 227 million guilders, or $109 million atcurrent exchange rates, from 161 million guilders a year earlier.   Revenue was flat at 13.6 billion guilders, or $6.5 billion,because the major domestic appliances business was no longerincluded in consolidated results. That business was put in a jointventure last year with Whirlpool Corp. Excluding that change,revenue rose 7 percent.   For the January-September period, net income rose 37 percent to685 million guilders, or $329 million, from 499 million guilders ayear earlier. Revenue rose to 39.8 billion guilders, or $19.1billion, from 39 billion guilders a year earlier.   For the Polygram stock offering, Philips said it intends to filea preliminary prospectus in the next few weeks with authorities inthe United States and the Netherlands. Philips owns 100 percent ofPolygram, having recently reacquired a 10 percent stake held by aninstutional investor. Philips declined Thursday to name theinvestor or say how much it paid to buy back the shares.</TEXT></DOC>
