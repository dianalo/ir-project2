She hopes to stack the head table with stars like Michael Douglas, Glenn Close and Michael J. Fox, and top directors like Brian De Palma. She hopes to dazzle theater owners with snippets from coming Columbia films. And she hopes to win a standing ovation for the finale: the studio's celluloid symbol and trademark for six decades, the torch-hoisting lady Columbia, with the triumphant message &quot;She's Back&quot; emblazoned across her figure.    Columbia Pictures badly needs the comeback. Never the top American studio, it still had been an industry powerhouse, with hits from 1934's &quot;It Happened One Night&quot; to 1984's &quot;Ghostbusters.&quot; Recently it has floundered, crippled by the ill effects of four management changes in six years. It ranks last among the nine American studios in box-office share. It hasn't had a big hit since &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; brought in over $200 million. Stars and dealmakers have defected in a steady stream to hot studios: Paramount, Warner and Disney.    Ms. Steel, 41, took charge last fall, succeeding British producer David Puttnam. He had put Columbia through its most wrenching change, making it the most controversial studio in Hollywood by attempting to buck the star system and its inflated egos and salaries. He shunned convention in his choice of films, favoring quirky or artistically interesting movies by foreign directors and producers over those with more commercial potential. The result: a string of flops that cost the studio over $100 million in write-offs.    By contrast, Ms. Steel's comeback strategy is a celebration of Hollywood convention. The former head of production at top-ranked Paramount Pictures, a Gulf andamp; Western Inc. subsidiary, and the first woman to get the top job at a major studio, she wants to make movies that make money by using proven themes and big stars. Mr. Puttnam spurned sequels; she relishes them. Mr. Puttnam alienated his stars; Ms. Steel courts them.    Mr. Puttnam's best-known films include &quot;The Mission&quot; and &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;; Ms. Steel has been most closely associated with commercial mainstreamers such as &quot;Flashdance,&quot; &quot;Footloose,&quot; &quot;Top Gun,&quot; and &quot;The Untouchables.&quot; At Columbia, she says, &quot;I hope to make strong commercial movies that also have artistic merit. Those two aren't mutually exclusive.&quot;    It isn't a surprise that Ms. Steel's strategy resembles that of her former employer, Paramount, the top-grossing studio for two years running. The idea is to produce a few summer and Christmas blockbusters as &quot;tent poles&quot; to support a string of more modest moneymakers.    That may be formulaic, but formulas make a lot of money for Hollywood. Of the summer's 10 top movies, four are sequels, including Paramount's &quot;Crocodile Dundee II.&quot; One hit, Paramount's &quot;Coming to America,&quot; is drawing crowds because of its big star, Eddie Murphy.    Ms. Steel's success is critical to the future of Columbia's parent company, Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. Formed last year, the company is an amalgam of several entertainment businesses that had been wholly or partially owned by Coca-Cola Co., including the five-year-old Tri-Star Pictures Inc., which has had only modest success in the movie business so far.    Columbia's executives have tried to persuade securities analysts to focus on the cash generated by its television business and theater chain. They promote its assets, including huge TV and film libraries, and its $2.5 billion credit line. But the parent company isn't expected to show a profit for at least two years. The new management must struggle to turn around the company under a cloud of speculation about its future. Coke still owns 49% of Columbia, and many on Wall Street believe it ultimately plans to sell out.    Victor Kaufman, 44, chief executive of Columbia Pictures Entertainment and Ms. Steel's boss, acknowledges his company must begin making successful movies again to survive the long haul and reclaim its film leadership. While Tri-Star will continue to operate as an independent production unit, most of Hollywood's attention -- and expectations -- is focused on Ms. Steel and her team at the Columbia studio.    Some doubt that Ms. Steel has enough experience for the job. In any case, she could hardly have picked a tougher time to start. The Hollywood writers' strike, now in its 21st week, prevents her getting projects under way once she signs them on. Despite that, she has brought key talent back to the Columbia fold, lined up important movie deals, and acquired a few that could tide the studio over nicely until her own are in production.    Ms. Steel has tenaciously wooed stars. She recruited Mr. Douglas, a producer and Academy Award winning actor, to Columbia by pursuing him relentlessly with telephone calls and invitations to lunch and dinner. &quot;I was flattered by her attention,&quot; he admits, adding that Ms. Steel was more receptive to some of his own ideas than other studios and promised him greater creative freedom.    Cher, the actress, says she agreed to follow Ms. Steel to Columbia from Paramount largely because Ms. Steel showed the greatest personal interest in her own ideas and projects. Stars such as Mr. Fox, Jack Nicholson and Kathleen Turner are developing projects at Columbia. Sally Field, Jane Fonda, Mr. Douglas and Cher will house their production companies at the studio, and directors such as Ridley Scott and Adrian Lyne will have offices there. &quot;I want to create an old fashioned Hollywood studio with people bumping into each other in the hallways and coming up with movie ideas,&quot; says Ms. Steel.    She has restored ties with powerful agents such as Creative Artists Agency's Michael Ovitz and producers such as Ray Stark, one of Hollywood's toughest and most prolific. Mr. Stark, whose movies include &quot;Funny Girl,&quot; &quot;Annie,&quot; and &quot;Peggy Sue Got Married,&quot; had feuded bitterly with Mr. Puttnam. Says Mr. Stark: &quot;It's no longer British Columbia, land of the emigres -- the studio is back to making classic, successful, popular films with commercial potential.&quot;    Ms. Steel quickly refloated some projects that Mr. Puttnam had scuttled, including sequels to &quot;Ghostbusters,&quot; &quot;Jagged Edge&quot; and &quot;Karate Kid II.&quot; She is mining Columbia's film library for remakes and other sequels. Columbia pictures now in development include sequels to &quot;The Big Chill,&quot; &quot;St. Elmo's Fire,&quot; &quot;The Deep,&quot; &quot;Shampoo&quot; and &quot;The Way We Were.&quot; Columbia is developing remakes of such classics as &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,&quot; &quot;Pal Joey,&quot; and &quot;The Man Who Came to Dinner.&quot;    Ms. Steel wasn't even in the running when Mr. Kaufman began looking for a replacement for Mr. Puttnam. He began by scouting such heavy hitters as NBC Entertainment President Brandon Tartikoff and Warner Bros. President Terry Semel. None were available -- in part, industry executives say, because of Mr. Kaufman's insistence on retaining final approval on movies for both Tri-Star and Columbia.    Ms. Steel, by contrast, was a rung down the Hollywood hierarchy and more comfortable with the system Mr. Kaufman proposed. Once he began to look at the next generation of potential movie managers, he says, he was impressed with &quot;her background, her sense of story, her relationships with creative people and her drive.&quot;    Mr. Kaufman says he reads only a third of the scripts at Columbia and Tri-Star and generally concurs with the recommendations of his creative executives. He figures that two studios with different management and 15 to 20 projects each stand a far better chance of coming up with hits. His main role, he says, is to see that both studios have a balanced mix of projects and &quot;to make sure we avoid the $30 million movie we shouldn't be doing.&quot;    So far, Mr. Kaufman has backed all Ms. Steel's major decisions, including her controversial acquisition of &quot;Casualties of War.&quot; Paramount had planned to make it for $17 million but got cold feet when producer Art Linson and director Mr. De Palma wanted to spend more. The studio was already leery of the movie's theme, the kidnaping and rape of a Vietnamese woman by U.S. soldiers. They also questioned whether its star, Mr. Fox, could draw viewers in a dramatic role.    Ms. Steel had worked closely with all the key players while at Paramount. She negotiated a deal to take over the project at a budget of about $22.5 million. She has kept close tabs on production, visiting the set in Thailand herself. She believes she has a hit on her hands. &quot;It's a very visible acquisition for a company that has not made a star movie in a very long time,&quot; she says.    Longtime associates say Ms. Steel's instincts are strong. &quot;She genuinely understands what the essential ingredients are for quality and entertainment in movies,&quot; says Jeffrey Katzenberg, a former Paramount executive who is now chairman of Walt Disney Co.'s motion-picture group.    Ms. Steel's career had unorthodox beginnings. She started as a sportswriter, then joined Penthouse magazine's merchandising staff, coming up with raunchy mail-order items such as &quot;Gucci&quot; toilet paper, named for publisher Bob Guccione. After a friend convinced her that she could market movies as easily as toilet paper, she landed a job as Paramount's director of merchandising.    Paramount's then-president, Michael Eisner, was impressed with her performance, and promoted her to vice president of movie production. In 1984, Mr. Eisner and chairman Barry Diller left the studio and took top executives with them to their respective jobs as heads of Walt Disney Co. and News Corp.'s Twentieth Century Fox. Ms. Steel, the most senior executive to stay on, took charge of Paramount's production.    Things turned rough for Ms. Steel after Paramount chief executive Frank Mancuso recruited Ned Tanen, a mercurial but talented executive who once headed Universal Studios. Ms. Steel and Mr. Tanen frequently clashed. Last year, Ms. Steel took maternity leave to bear a daughter by her second marriage, to producer Chuck Roven. While she was away, Mr. Tanen brought in a young Tri-Star executive, Gary Lucchesi, as an apparent replacement.    Paramount offered a lucrative consolation prize: a contract as a producer. Although embittered by her experience there, she agreed. She thought motherhood would be easier as a working producer than as an executive. But when Mr. Kaufman &quot;offered me the chance of a lifetime,&quot; she says, &quot;it was an offer I couldn't refuse.&quot;    Now she typically rises at 6 a.m. to be with the baby, gets into the office by 9:30, returns home at 6:30 p.m. (returning calls from her Jaguar), visits two more hours with the child, and then rushes out to a screening or business dinner. Ms. Steel has had a conference room next to her office converted into a mininursery, and brings the baby with her on occasional trips to Columbia's New York headquarters.    Ms. Steel has earned a reputation as a tough, sometimes abrasive executive. Her supporters say it has helped her survive in the Hollywood old boys' network. Ms. Steel, who sometimes startles callers by greeting them with an affectionate obscenity, &quot;didn't get where she is today by being some '50s cliche of a sweet little woman,&quot; says Cher.    Ms. Steel's candor and directness impress many who say they are used to more deviousness in Hollywood. Jane Fonda is impressed. After arriving at Columbia, Ms. Steel called a meeting with Ms. Fonda to discuss her movie, &quot;The Old Gringo,&quot; a $23 million project about Mexican revolutionaries. &quot;She was inheriting a project that wasn't exactly 'Ghostbusters,'&quot; says Ms. Fonda. &quot;She was very honest about the fact that it wasn't the kind of film she would ordinarily cotton to.&quot;    Ms. Steel decided to go ahead with the movie. While Ms. Fonda says she leaned hard on the producers to finish it on time and within its budget, Ms. Steel let them have a few extra days to shoot a crucial scene. &quot;She was very tough, but when we really needed something, she came through for us,&quot; Ms. Fonda says.    The relatively young and untested executives who work for Ms. Steel say she expects them to be passionate about the projects they champion and to argue with her if they don't agree with her. She kept on her team Michael Nathanson, 33, and Thomas Rothman, 33, both of whom had worked for Mr. Puttnam. She hired Robert Fried, 29, an Orion executive with close ties to Sean Penn and other young actors. Roger Faxon, 40, Tri-Star business affairs manager, became her chief operating officer.    To strengthen marketing, Ms. Steel hired Dan Michel, 42, an advertising agency executive whose specialty was movie campaigns but who had never before worked at a studio. He is considering ideas such as buying a weekly advertising column in People magazine to report favorably on Columbia movies.    It will take at least a year for the team to prove itself, but Columbia does appear to be back in the game. Says Sally Field, whose movie, &quot;Punchline,&quot; is due out in September after being handed around through four different Columbia administrations: &quot;Columbia has a very energized, excited feel about it, and everyone agrees it's finally moving forward.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
