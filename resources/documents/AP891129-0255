LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Southwest Bank, which made headlines bytrimming its prime lending rate three weeks ago, has quietly raisedthe rate back to 10.5 percent from 10 percent.   Southwest had stood alone in lowering the key interest rate,which reflects a bank's cost of borrowing money and is used incalculating business and consumer loans.   The bank, which raised its prime on Tuesday, said it reversedits earlier decision due to recent moves by the the Federal Reserveto keep interest rates firm.   The Fed, performing a quick about-face, had drained money fromthe nation's banking system on Monday, driving the so-calledfederal funds rate upward. The fed funds rate is the interest onovernight loans between banks and is closely watched as anindicator of the central bank's policy on interest rates.   ``It looks like the Fed doesn't intend to move the rate lower,''said I.A. Long, Southwest's chairman-emeritus, who has made hisreputation by repeatedly being the first banker in the country tocut the prime.</TEXT></DOC>
