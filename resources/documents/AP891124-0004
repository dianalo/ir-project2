The changes come as industry, under pressure from government andenvironmentalists, seeks to eliminate the use ofchlorofluorocarbons, the one-time wonder chemical that has beendestroying the Earth's ozone layer.   But the task is more complicated than simply replacing an oldchemical with a new one, government and industry experts say.   ``The transition is going to take time ... We're talking aboutretrofitting not one industry, but several industries,'' says F.A.``Tony'' Vogelsberg, environmental manager for the Freon Divisionat Du Pont, a major producers of CFCs.   CFCs, discovered in 1928, help cool houses in the summer andkeep them warm in the winter. They are used to make the foamcushions on couches, in pillows _ even in stuffed toys.   Without them, refrigerators would not cool as well; radios,televisions, stereos or home computers might not work as well, anditems from coaxial cables to mailed Christmas gifts might not haveas much packaging protection.   But CFCs also have a dark side: When they float 10 to 30 milesabove the Earth to the stratosphere, their chlorine component eatsaway at the ozone shield that protects against the sun'scancer-causing ultraviolet rays.   Industrial nations want to ban all CFC production within thenext decade. But while a half-dozen or more replacements are understudy, they all have some drawbacks and no single substitute isexpected to be found.   ``I don't think there's going to be a substitute that is goingto be given an A-plus on all (areas of concern),'' said EileenClaussen, director of atmospheric and indoor air programs at theEnvironmental Protection Agency. ``We're going to have to make sometradeoffs.''   The EPA is examining the array of substitutes, mainly a familyof chemicals called HCFCs, to determine whether they are toxic orpose other health concerns and how significantly they harm theenvironment. The HCFCs also deplete ozone but much less severely.   ``We clearly do not want to blunder along and create a newhealth or environmental problem while solving the ones that wetargeted,'' said Charles Elkins, whose EPA office is reviewing thepotential toxicity of some CFC substitutes.   Every year more than 2 billion pounds of CFCs are producedworldwide, a third of them in the United States.   The United States banned use of the chemical in aerosol cans in1978, four years after the first concerns about the ozone layerwere raised. Still, the operation of more than $135 billion worthof equipment nationwide is dependent on CFCs.   Industry turned to CFCs because they do not burn or corrodemetal, pose no direct health hazards to workers and hold heat andcold, making them ideal insulators.   That was before their threat to the ozone layer was understood.   Half of the ozone over Antarctica was destroyed during Septemberand October 1987, causing a hole in the Earth's protective shieldthat closes and reappears with the seasons. Severe destruction ofthe ozone layer is believed to be occurring over the South Poleagain this year, according to scientists. They say the conditionsfor ozone destruction are present over the Arctic, although nomassive loss of ozone has been observed there.   Several large corporations have announced plans to end theirreliance on CFCs, some by the early 1990s. These include suchgiants as ATandamp;T, IBM, Boeing and General Electric.   ``We have used CFC solvents and cleaners for so long they'realmost ingrained in the manufacturing process,'' says DavidChittick, vice president for environment and safety at ATandamp;T.Nevertheless, ATandamp;T hopes to end all uses of CFCs by 1994.   The major automakers are developing substitutes and aredesigning new air conditioning units to accommodate the changeover,probably in the mid-1990s.   But the new air conditioners will be less energy efficient andrequire larger compressors, experts say. ``We feel we can do itwithout any dramatic effects on the look or design of the car. It'sgoing to be difficult though,'' says Toni Simonetti, a GMspokeswoman.   Congress is considering legislation calling for the eliminationof CFCs by the year 2000 and at least 20 states are reviewingproposals aimed at curbing CFC pollution. Vermont has banned theuse of CFCs in auto air conditioners after 1994.   Du Pont has spent more than $100 million on research for CFCsubstitutes and estimates it will spend as much as $1 billion tobuild production plants and to cover other costs during a 10-yeartransition period. ICI Americas, another major manufacturer, alsohas spent $100 million in CFC replacement research and recentlyannounced plans to begin production of a substitute cooling agentby 1992 at a new Louisiana plant.   But developing substitute chemicals will not be enough.   As much as 30 percent of today's CFC demand will have to beeliminated by conservation and recycling, government and industryexperts say. Major appliance manufacturers as well as automakersrecently have supplied their repair shops with equipment to captureCFCs rather than let the old coolant vent into the air.   But EPA and industry officials acknowledge that routine ventingof old CFCs is still widespread.   Shifts to new manufacturing procedures or altogether newtechnology could account for a 30 percent reduction in CFC demand,especially in the electronics industry, the experts say.   But some critics say that industry is slow to accept newtechnology. ``What we're facing is inertia,'' says Marc Goldberg ofCrynodynamics, a New Jersey-based company that is producing arefrigeration system using helium as a cooling agent. The system isbeing marketed primarily for commercial uses. The major automakershave expressed little interest.   Companies such as ATandamp;T and Northern Telecom are turning to newmanufacturing procedures such as using low-solid fluxes to reduceleftover residues and eliminate the need for CFCs as a solvent forcleaning circuit boards after soldering.   ``This (CFC problem) has caused a whole new review of the way wedo business,'' says A.D. Fitzgerald, director of environmentalaffairs at Northern Telecom, a Canadian-based manufacturer oftelephone equipment.   The thorniest problems have emerged in the area of refrigerationand air conditioning because all substitutes under considerationpose energy and environmental tradeoffs, particularly in the areaof global warming.   A bill putting a time limit on use of HCFCs as substitutes forchlorofluorocarbons has been approved by a Senate environmentalsubcommittee, but its prospects in Congress are uncertain.   Environmentalists say, meanwhile, that even the less potentHCFCs would be a dangerous threat to ozone depletion if the amountused worldwide is dramatically increased over the next century.   The HCFC family of substitutes should be looked at only as a``bridge'' solution and industry should not be allowed to ``sitback and be happy once they made the one-step transition,'' saysDavid Doniger, an attorney for the Natural Resources DefenseCouncil.</TEXT></DOC>
