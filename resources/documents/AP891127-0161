By afternoon, snow fell over much of the northern Plains regionand the upper Mississippi Valley, while rain extended from easternNebraska into the upper Great Lakes region and northern sections ofthe lower Ohio Valley.   The storm had produced more than 3 feet of snow in California'sSierra Nevada range on Saturday, and on Sunday dumped 10 to 20inches of snow at many ski resorts in Colorado.   Western South Dakota got the heaviest snow Monday with 18 inchesat Spearfish and Galena, both in the Black Hills.   Northerly wind blowing at 20 to 50 mph in South Dakota reducedvisibility to near zero in blowing snow, and produced wind chillreadings calculated as low as 30 degrees below zero.   Visibility was zero to one-fourth mile in parts of the northwestand southwest corners of the state. Roads were snowpacked andslippery throughout the northwest with light to heavy drifting inmany areas.   Dozens of schools were closed across parts of South Dakota andsoutheastern North Dakota.   Cass County, N.D., Sheriff Donald Rudnick said it appeared mostpeople heeded warnings about dangerous travel conditions.   ``That's one good thing, we haven't had a lot of stalled carsbecause it looks like most people weren't out in it,'' Rudnick said.   In Richland County, N.D., dispatcher Lori Kubitz reported anumber of vehicles were blown off icy roads. ``The wind is blowingso hard that the plow trucks can't even spread any sand on theroads,'' she said.   Strong northerly wind, gusting to 50 mph, ushered cold arcticair across the Plains, and sharply reduced visibility in blowingdust across parts of Kansas, the National Weather Service said.   Strong southerly wind ahead of an approaching cold front helpingtemperatures in the middle Mississippi Valley and the lower OhioValley warm into the 50s and 60s, with some readings above 70degrees.   Peoria, Ill., hit a record 71; St. Louis, Mo., had a record 72;and Springfield, Ill., had a record 72.   Monday's low for the Lower 48 states was 8 degrees above zero atMcCall, Idaho.</TEXT></DOC>
