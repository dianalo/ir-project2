During oral arguments yesterday on an appeal by R. Foster Winans, convicted of securities and mail fraud in 1985, Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justice Antonin Scalia expressed doubts about whether the former reporter's actions were covered by the anti-fraud provisions of securities law.    Other justices, however, questioned the argument of Mr. Winans's lawyer, Don Buchwald, who said that federal criminal laws can't be used to enforce a violation of the Journal's policy forbidding employees from using confidential information.    The case is being watched closely by the securities industry because it may have a significant impact on the prosecution of other insider-trading cases. The case tests the government's theory that improper use of confidential information in connection with securities transactions -- called misappropriation -- may be illegal even when the case doesn't involve the traditional insider-trading model of corporate officials using or passing on inside knowledge.    Mr. Winans, his former roommate David Carpenter, a onetime news assistant at the Journal, and Kenneth Felis, a former Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. stockbroker, were convicted for participating in a stock-trading scheme that relied on advance information about the timing and content of &quot;Heard on the Street&quot; columns in the Journal. Mr. Winans wrote some of the columns in 1983 and 1984.    Messrs. Winans and Felis were convicted of mail and securities fraud, and Mr. Carpenter of aiding the scheme. Mr. Winans, who attended yesterday's session at the high court, was sentenced to 18 months in prison and fined $5,000. Mr. Felis was sentenced to a six-month term, to be served on weekends, and fined $25,000. Mr. Carpenter was fined $1,000 and placed on three years' probation.    A federal appeals court affirmed the convictions in May 1986. The sentences of all three have been delayed pending their appeal.    The Supreme Court is likely to spend several months, at least, deciding the case, and no decision is expected until the spring. Although some justices appeared to indicate through their questions which way they are leaning, the outcome of the appeal remains uncertain until the high court announces its ruling.    Arguing for the government, Solicitor General Charles Fried said the property misappropriated was the Journal's confidential information about when a column would be published and what approach it would take in discussing a particular company. The &quot;harm,&quot; he argued, was in putting the Journal's reputation at risk from possible disclosure of Mr. Winans's trading scheme.    But Justice Scalia said it was &quot;strange&quot; to suggest that a scheme that merely risks some harm &quot;is sufficient to support a criminal charge.&quot; His remarks appeared to support a comment by Justice John Stevens that the risk was &quot;intangible.&quot;    The strongest statement was made by Chief Justice Rehnquist. Mr. Fried argued that Mr. Winans breached a duty to his employer by divulging confidential information. Justice Rehnquist remarked that if Congress wanted to make it a criminal act to breach an employer's confidentiality, legislators could have done that. &quot;Congress spoke in very general terms. It seems to me you're kind of putting layers on it,&quot; the chief justice said.    The justices raised fewer questions, however, about the convictions for mail fraud, which are based on a different federal criminal law.    But other justices focused their attention on Mr. Buchwald. Justice Harry Blackmun asked whether Mr. Buchwald was arguing that there was no legal remedy available to redress Mr. Winans's conduct. Mr. Buchwald replied that the remedy was what the Journal did. &quot;They fired him and wrote about it on their front page,&quot; he said. &quot;They effectively drummed him out of the profession.&quot;    Mr. Buchwald said that Mr. Winans's conduct was no different than if Salomon Brothers Inc., knowing that its influential economist Henry Kaufman was planning an afternoon speech predicting lower interest rates, traded in its own accounts in the morning. He didn't suggest that Salomon does such trading.    Mr. Buchwald said the government's argument &quot;would elevate every employee's ethical breach into a federal crime.&quot; But Mr. Fried said the government wasn't proposing &quot;anything so far out as petitioners suggest.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
