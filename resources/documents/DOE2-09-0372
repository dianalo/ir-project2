A typical and important case whereinterpretation can be difficult is a three layer formation with the centerlayer being an oil bearing (resistive) layer sandwiched between two conductiveshoulder layers. In order to obtain the resistivity of the oil layerfrom induction logs, the effect of borehole and shoulder layers mustbe compensated for. Two standard methods are used in industry for sucha compensation. In the first method, the borehole effect is ignored completelyand the apparent conductivity is processed by the so called bed thicknesscorrection only. In the second method, the log signal is first subtractedby a borehole contribution, generated by assuming the center layer isinfinitely thick, and then the bed thickness correction is applied tothe remaining signal. Strictly, of course, there is no justificationfor treating the borehole and bed thickness effect in such a decoupledmanner. This paper is to examine the conventional correction methodsdescribed above. The authors apply the correction methods to syntheticdata and then compare the corrected resistivity to the true resistivity.Such an examination was not done in the past because of the lack of adata synthesis method.</TEXT></DOC>
