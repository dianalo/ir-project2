<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-28-1150 </DOCNO><TEXT>An unusual group of cherts found at saline, alkaline Lake Bogoria in theKenya Rift differs from the Magadi-type cherts commonly associated withsaline, alkaline lakes. The cherts are opaline, rich in diatoms, andformed from a siliceous, probably gelatinous, precursor that precipitatedaround submerged alkaline hot springs during a Holocene phase of highlake level. Silica precipitation resulted from rapid drop in the temperatureof the spring waters and, possibly, pH. Lithification began before subaerialexposure. Ancient analogous cherts are likely to be localized depositsalong fault lines.</TEXT></DOC>
