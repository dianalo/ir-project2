At the time he said he didn't have enough evidence to go to trial, but that he soon would. It's now a full year later, and Robert Freeman, Richard Wigton and Timothy Tabor remain suspended in legal limbo.    The arrests of the three back in February 1987 were calculated for maximum effect. Mr. Tabor, who had been a Kidder, Peabody arbitrager, was arrested so late on Feb. 11, 1987, that he couldn't get a lawyer or the cash to make bail. He refused to be wired to tape his former boss Mr. Wigton, so he spent the night in the slammer. The next day Mr. Giuliani had federal marshals march into Kidder, throw Mr. Wigton against the wall, frisk and handcuff him, then lead him away in tears. Mr. Freeman, head of Goldman Sachs's arb department, was escorted by camera crews into a police van.    Then the trio became the first of the accused inside traders who refused to plead guilty. Also, the three were not caught behaving like criminals, trading suitcases of cash for stolen information. For the first time, prosecutors faced the necessity of proving in court that otherwise routine-looking stock trading was based on illicit information.    Mr. Giuliani thought he had a case after striking a plea bargain with Martin Siegel, formerly Kidder's top takeover specialist, who admitted taking suitcases of cash from Ivan Boesky. In bargaining over his sentence, Mr. Siegel claimed he traded inside information about takeover bids with Mr. Freeman, then passed the news to his Kidder colleagues. The three deny this, and point to press speculation about the stocks before the trades. In a trial, Mr. Siegel would have to convince a jury that he told the three that his information was illicit, but there is no obvious reason why he would have.    Mr. Giuliani dropped the indictments when a federal judge turned down his request to delay the trial. He promised more would come by that summer, and later said there would be new indictments by the fall of 1987. Despite the Supreme Court Winans ruling that greatly expanded wire-fraud liability, there still has been no further word.    So the Giuliani 3 are caught in a Kafkaesque warp. Goldman Sachs has supported Mr. Freeman, who still reports to work, yet he remains under the cloud of possible reindictment. Mr. Tabor already had left Kidder, but Mr. Wigton became the trophy in an intracorporate tug of war. General Electric officers disagreed with the tough approach to the case its subsidiary, Kidder, wanted to take. GE cut a deal with Mr. Giuliani. Mr. Wigton was forced out, Kidder paid a $25 million penalty and disbanded its arb department.    In Mr. Giuliani's defense, the Supreme Court now deciding the constitutionality of independent counsel might compare this case with independent counsel Alexia Morrison's prosecution of former Justice Department official Theodore Olson. It's been 18 months since Ms. Morrison admitted that Mr. Olson violated no law during his 1983 congressional testimony, but she still hasn't dropped the case, and Mr. Olson now has a $1 million legal bill.    At least Mr. Giuliani, following Justice Department guidelines, dropped the indictments when he saw there was no evidence to proceed. Unlike independent counsel, Mr. Giuliani doesn't have to make his reputation by pursuing these three beyond the ends of the earth. He has big victories with the convictions of major drug runners and corrupt public officials.    It looks to us, though, that Mr. Siegel pulled his best con job of all with the inside information he peddled to the prosecutors. If Mr. Giuliani can't make his case after a year, he should admit there is no case to make and give the accused their full freedom. </TEXT></DOC>
