The carefully worded statement listed &quot;tax revenueincreases&quot; as one of the elements necessary for budgetdeficit reduction. White House officials refused toelaborate. But clearly, the president now is ready tonegotiate a budget deal with Congress that could include newor higher taxes.</LP><TEXT>   Despite White House efforts to play it down, the messagehit here like a bombshell. Barely an hour before thestatement was released, for example, the American TruckingAssociation's executive committee had assured its membersthat the odds of a fuel-tax increase this year were no betterthan one in three. Then came the news release. &quot;We're all alot more worried than we were a few minutes ago,&quot; saidKenneth Simonson, staff economist for the group.   Thus, the first great economic and political debate of the1990s is now under way: How should government redistributethe tax burden?   Republicans, who have been making political hay portrayingDemocrats as big taxers, were quick to suggest that if taxesmust rise, the targets should be gasoline, alcohol andtobacco -- taxes that can be disguised as &quot;user fees.&quot;Democrats snapped back that those taxes would hit low-incomepeople especially hard. Sen. James Sasser, the TennesseeDemocrat who chairs the powerful Senate Budget Committee, hadhis own idea: Sock it to the rich.   The likely result is a combination of both, something thatsatisfies everyone -- sort of -- by hurting everyone. Alcoholand tobacco taxes are at the top of the hit list, andgasoline and environmental-cleanup taxes may not be farbehind. Excise taxes, after all, seem to be the easiest wayto close the budget gap.   But in return, Democrats will demand that the top tax rateon the very wealthy be increased. A deepening reaction to theReagan-era tax cuts of the 1980s leads many to demand anincrease in taxes for high-income people.   &quot;What you have now is a growing middle-class awarenessthat their load is high, and maybe even higher, than thepeople at the top,&quot; says Kevin Phillips, a politicalconsultant who has just written a book about the politics ofwealth and poverty.   Some Republicans tried to argue yesterday that thepresident's comments were nothing new. &quot;Tax revenueincreases,&quot; they noted, could refer to the $14 billion inadditional income -- from tougher tax-collection enforcement,for instance -- that's already included in the president'sbudget. &quot;The statement as issued doesn't reflect asignificant change in Republican policy,&quot; said Rep. NewtGingrich, the House Republican whip.   But even fervent anti-tax Republicans acknowledged thatthe president now appears willing to leave his emphaticcampaign pledge behind. &quot;It's bad news, but not surprisingnews,&quot; said Dan Mitchell, a senior fellow at the HeritageFoundation, a conservative think-tank. From the moment thatMr. Bush began the summit talks on the budget withcongressional leaders on May 15, &quot;the White House wasprepared to capitulate on taxes,&quot; he said.   While the remaining budget negotiations are certain to belong and difficult, the best estimate now is that the budgetsummit, if successful, will produce a package of about $50billion in deficit reductions. Of that about half -- $25billion -- may come from increased taxes.   Some administration officials have privately acknowledgedthey'd be willing to accept higher taxes on so-called &quot;sin&quot;items, notably alcohol and tobacco. That move could raise asmuch as $10 billion a year. And polls suggest the Americanpublic might go along. A recent Wall Street Journal/NBC Newspoll, for instance, shows 83% of voters would favorincreasing alcohol and tobacco taxes if the government had tohave a tax increase.   Gasoline taxes are also high on the agenda, along withother environment and energy-related taxes that would spreadthe costs even wider -- a &quot;BTU tax&quot; on all energyconsumption, for instance; an oil-import fee, or acarbon-based fuel that would hit heating oil, coal andnatural gas, as well as gasoline. Such fuel taxes raise a lotof money -- a 25-cent a gallon gasoline tax would bring in$25 billion, for instance -- and they have the added benefitof helping the environment. &quot;If you're going to raiserevenues you might as well do some collateral good,&quot; saysRep. Tom Downey, a Democratic member of the Ways and MeansCommittee.   But raising fuel taxes is distinctly less popular than theidea of sticking it to the rich. The Wall Street Journal/NBCNews poll in May found that in a choice between increasingincome tax rates for upper-income Americans and increasingthe gasoline tax, 68% favored hitting the rich, while only28% preferred paying more for fuel.   Higher gasoline taxes are also much less popular thanalcohol and tobacco taxes -- though even such products figurein the debate over the fairness of the tax burden. InChicago, a coalition of labor unions and alcohol and tobaccocompanies has already prepared a hard-hitting advertisingcampaign that would portray such a tax increase as a kick tothe pocketbook of the working person.   One ad shows tuxedo-clad men getting out of a veryexpensive automobile. &quot;This is a Rolls Royce Cornicheconvertible,&quot; the announcer says. &quot;If you're amultimillionaire, you can buy one for $200,000.&quot; Then thecamera turns to a bottle of beer. &quot;Sixty-five cents,&quot; theannouncer says. &quot;Regular people enjoy them in their backyardson hot summer days. . . . Guess which one the governmentwants to tax now?&quot;   The group tested the ads in six medium-sized televisionmarkets in February and found an impressive impact. Beforethe ads aired, 55% of respondents opposed a beer-taxincrease; afterward, the opposition level rose to 66%.   William Berman of the American Automobile Associationnotes that even Mr. Bush has argued gasoline taxes are unfairto the poor. In a letter written to the group during the 1988campaign, Mr. Bush said, &quot;a gas tax increase to balance thebudget would particularly hurt lower wage earners, familieswith both spouses working, and farmers and residents ofWestern states who have to drive long distances.&quot;   The administration is likely to magnify the criticism byalso insisting on cutting the tax on capital gains. Althoughthat might have the virtue of raising revenue in the shortterm, the vast majority of the tax benefits would go to thoseearning $100,000 a year or more.   Democrats have already begun their counterattack. &quot;AnyBush tax initiative,&quot; Rep. Robert Torricelli, a New JerseyDemocrat, said on the floor of the House yesterday, &quot;iscertain to include new privileges and tax breaks for thewealthy.&quot;   To address their concerns about tax fairness, Democratsare insisting any tax package eliminate the so-called bubblein the current tax rate structure. Under current law, a 33%rate is imposed on single people's taxable income betweenabout $47,000 and $97,000, and on joint filers' between$78,000 and $162,000. The rate then falls back to 28% onincome above those levels. The Democrats insist that inreturn for a capital-gains cut, the 28% rate should beincreased.   The Bush administration and its allies say they remainadamantly opposed to any increase in federal income-taxrates. &quot;I don't think you can give up on marginal rates,&quot;said Mitch Daniels, president of the Hudson Institute andformer political aide in the Reagan White House. &quot;I wouldn'tgive up on the bubble.&quot;   But even the White House's Democratic ally on the capitalgains tax cut, Rep. Ed Jenkins of Georgia, believes the toprate is likely to increase as part of a trade-off for capitalgains. &quot;If you are going to raise those top rates anyway, youought to get something for it, like capital gains,&quot; he said.   Mr. Phillips, the political consultant, argues that thepost-Reagan push for more taxes on the wealthy is alreadyevident in a number of states. He points to New Jersey Gov.James Florio's tax package, which doubles the top income-taxrate in that state from 3.5% to 7%. And he notes that inCalifornia, the Democratic chairmen of the senate andassembly revenue committees favor raising that state's toptax bracket to 11% from 9.3%.   Moreover, a number of states, including New York,Connecticut and Massachusetts, are looking at new taxes oncertain professional services, such as management consulting,advertising and public relations. Mr. Phillips says thatthese moves, too, constitute an effort to shift more of thetax burden to the upper-income brackets.   To be sure, no one in Washington even hints of a return tothe pre-Reagan days when the top tax rate rose as high as70%. Some, such as New York Democratic Rep. Charles Schumer,say the goal is to make the tax structure somewhat moreprogressive -- tilted more to the poor and less to thewealthy -- than it is now. Others say their aim is only tohold the line against a further shift in a regressivedirection.   But in any event, it's clear that tax &quot;fairness&quot; hasbecome a rising concern, making the problem of whose taxes toincrease increasingly sticky.   The budget summit talks, if they succeed, are likely toprovide only general outlines of a tax bill, leaving detailsto the House and Senate tax-writing committees. And whenfaced with the pointed debate over whose taxes to raise, theyare likely to cast a broad net, spreading the pain over asmany groups as possible.   &quot;If the assumption is a $25 billion tax increase forfiscal 1991, in my judgment it has got to be a verybroad-based package,&quot; said big-business lobbyist CharlsWalker. &quot;It has to be a package of pain that strikes out inas many directions and touches as many people and groups aspossible.&quot;   Thus, even new federal targets such as advertising mayreach the hit list in Washington. Some government taxofficials are contemplating a plan that would cut the taxdeduction for advertising expenses to 80% from the current100%.   Insurance companies may also take a hit. Stock-ownedinsurance companies and mutually owned insurance companieshave been feuding for decades over each other's taxtreatment. &quot;They're like children,&quot; says Rep. Fortney Stark,a California Democrat. The result this year may be that bothsee their tax burden rise.   The two insurance groups have been preparing for thatpossibility for months, each hiring scores of lobbyists topush its cause on Capitol Hill and contributing huge amountsof money to the tax-writers' campaign coffers. Six mutuallife insurance companies even contributed $100,000 last monthto a charity function organized by Chris Downey, the wife ofRep. Downey, the mutuals' top supporter on the Ways and MeansCommittee. &quot;It's a coincidence,&quot; says Anne Fleming, whohelped organize the fund-raiser, of the insurance companies'support.   Other possibilities include using the tax code to crackdown on a range of perceived environmental evils, includingsulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and carbon dioxide emissions,polystyrene packaging, and lumber cut from old redwoods. Arelated possibility involves limiting the deduction foremployer-provided parking expenses, a move that woulddiscourage commuting by car.   Other tax-raising options aimed at hitting corporations orhigh-income taxpayers that are likely to be considered byCongress include:   -- Taxing Social Security benefits received by high-incometaxpayers.   -- Taxing gains on short-term securities trades morestiffly.   -- Restricting a real-estate tax break permitting tax-freeswaps of property.   -- Stepping up efforts to collect taxes from U.S.subsidiaries of foreign corporations.   All these options may seem like a long laundry list, butthe tab is also big. A $25 billion tax increase would be thebiggest one-year tax increase in history. As a grinning Waysand Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski warned recently at abreakfast meeting in Chicago: &quot;Here comes the tax man.&quot;   ---                       Taxing Choice                                                                                                          &quot;Let us suppose that in order to reduce the federal budgetdeficit some taxes had to be raised, and the choice came downto increasing the income tax rate for upper-income earners orincreasing the tax on gasoline. Which would you favor?&quot;                                                                                                          Increase the tax rate   for upper-income earners                  68%                                                                                                          Increase the tax on gasoline              28%                                                                                                          Based on a survey conducted May 18-22, 1990                                                                                                          The Wall Street Journal/NBC News Poll</TEXT></DOC>
