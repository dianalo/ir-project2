As a result, consumers could see prices for gasoline andother petroleum products creeping up, industry executivessay. The price hikes will vary from region to region andtheir size will depend on how fast the industry shakes out.Whatever the effect on pocketbooks, the competitive changesare reshaping the refining and marketing business from theoil refinery gate to the corner service station.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I expect to see one million to two million barrels a dayof capacity off the market in the next 12 to 24 months,&quot; saysJohn Hall, chairman of Ashland Oil Inc. During that period,costly requirements of the Clean Air Act begin to kick in.William Lowrie, president of Amoco Corp.'s refiningsubsidiary, agrees that 10% to 15% of the nation's 15.3million barrels of daily capacity will close down, but thinksit will take 10 to 15 years.   Mr. Hall says the greatest pressures will be on smallerrefineries with less than 50,000 barrels of daily capacitybecause they can't take advantage of economies of scale andhave greater trouble financing new projects.   Refinery closings have been brewing since passage of theClean Air Act and the nation's economic recession. But theissue was highlighted last week when Chevron Corp. said itwould shutter a portion and possibly all of its refinery inPort Arthur, Texas, except for some chemical operations.Built 90 years ago, the 315,000-barrel plant is Chevron'slargest and oldest.   Keeping the refinery running at full capacity under newenvironmental emission and waste-water treatment rules, plusupgrading equipment to make cleaner gasoline and otherpetroleum products, would have cost Chevron about $1.1billion, the company says. It would cost half that amount torun the plant at reduced capacity. At a minimum, 500 jobswill be lost. If the whole plant is closed, 1,600 employeeswould be dismissed.   Chevron plans to spend as much as $6.5 billion over thenext five years on its refineries, with about one-third ofthat figure mandated by environmental regulations.   Industrywide spending estimates have ranged from $20billion to an even more astronomical $41 billion through1995. &quot;At first I found those numbers a little hard tobelieve, but now I believe them in spades,&quot; says David Hoyer,president of Chevron's refining subsidiary. Jumping on theindustry bandwagon of attacking Washington and raising thespecter that environmental compliance is costing jobs, Mr.Hoyer says: &quot;Four hundred million dollars is only a paltrysum to a congressman.&quot;   Skeptics have questioned oil industry claims, but therehave been signs that the tab does add up and will haveconsequences. In recent months:   -- Amoco closed its marginally profitable30,000-barrel-a-day refinery in Casper, Wyo., rather thanspend $150 million to keep it running. The plant employed 210people.   -- To avoid several hundred million dollars ofimprovements needed to keep its Los Angeles-area refineryrunning this decade, the Shell Oil Co. unit of RoyalDutch/Shell Group put the facility up for sale and said itwould close the plant if a buyer weren't found. Unocal Corp.bought a portion of the refinery, which enabled Unocal toshut down a portion of its own capacity. The transactionremoved 108,000 barrels from the marketplace.   -- Phillips Petroleum Co. tried to sell its 25,000-barrelWoods Cross, Utah, refinery. Unable to get an acceptableprice, Phillips will spend more than $50 million forenvironmental and other improvements.   -- Fletcher Oil andamp; Refining Co. temporarily closed itsCarson, Calif., refinery and laid off most of the 200 workersthere. The company isn't certain if operations at the30,000-barrel plant will resume.   -- British Petroleum Co. has held talks about the possiblesale of its large 171,000-barrel Philadelphia refinery andChevron has also had discussions about selling itssimilar-sized Philadelphia plant, according to a personfamiliar with the talks. Both BP and Chevron say their plantsaren't for sale at this time. Chevron may need thePhiladelphia plant's output now that it will produce less atPort Arthur.   The burden on small refineries is greater, refiningindustry executives say. For one, they have more troublefinancing investments. Plus they're at a competitivedisadvantage in making upgrades.   For instance, Ashland is building a $57 million unit thatreduces the sulphur content of diesel fuel made at itsCatlettsburg, Ky., refinery, to meet tougher standards thatbegin Oct. 1, 1993. At its refinery in St. Paul Park, Minn.,the same equipment costs $31 million although the facility isone-third the size.   Today's cutthroat gasoline market and expectations thatdemand will at best grow just slightly in coming years arealso behind many of the decisions to pare down operations.&quot;If we had booming gasoline demand, they wouldn't be shuttingplants down, they'd be fixing them up,&quot; says Thomas Manning,a principal at refinery consultants Purvin andamp; Gertz Inc.   The looming deadlines of the Clean Air Act and the bleakdemand outlook are &quot;forcing refiners to look at all theiroperations now,&quot; says Kenneth Miller, another Purvinofficial.   For instance, a modest Gulf Coast plant last year had anaverage profit margin of 70 cents for every barrel refined.That is enough to stay in business right now but wouldn't beenough to justify large expenditures, Purvin executives say.   &quot;Demand will be flat for the whole decade,&quot; predictsNorman Higby, a Menlo Park, Calif., energy forecaster.   Why so bleak? First, the weak economy reduces demand forpetroleum products. Beyond that, the constant increase in thenumber of cars with greater fuel efficiency cuts demand, Mr.Higby says. And, says Dennis Eklof, senior consultant atCambridge Energy Research Associates, the population isgrowing slowly and aging. Generally, older drivers driveless.   How quickly the refinery expenditures are passed throughto consumers is hard to gauge. The reduction in gasolinerefining capacity will be mitigated somewhat because someenvironmental regulations call for putting more oxygen-likeproducts into each gallon. So the refineries that stay openwill overall produce a bit more gasoline from each barrel ofcrude oil processed.   What isn't clear is how quickly refiners will be able topass along costs, given the highly competitive marketplace.Some refiners will be able to make adjustments quicker andcould try to gain market share by keeping prices low. Othersmay have to take losses just to compete at all.   But to stay in business and justify increased spending,refiners say they'll have to boost prices. &quot;The bottom lineon this is we'll see significantly increasing fuel costs inthe U.S.,&quot; says Amoco's Mr. Lowrie. &quot;The consumer is going topay for it.&quot;   ---   Allanna Sullivan in New York contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
