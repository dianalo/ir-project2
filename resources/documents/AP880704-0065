EDITS to tighten; picks up 19th graf pvs, bgng, `Jacksonmade.'</NOTE><BYLINE>By LAURA KING</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   George Bush today expressed regrets about the destruction of anIranian passenger jet, but defended the captain of the U.S. warshipinvolved, saying ``he did what he had to do.'' Michael Dukakis,expanding on his reaction Sunday, urged Iran to ``reconsider itsthreats'' to respond with terrorism.   Jesse Jackson, meanwhile, called on the Reagan administration tore-evaluate its Middle East policy in the wake of tragedy in thePersian Gulf, but said the United States should maintain itspresence in the war-torn region.   Bush, the all-but-certain Republican nominee, broke his silenceon the incident as he traveled to a Fourth of July celebration inMichigan. The vice president, who spent the weekend inKennebunkport, Maine, was ``briefed throughout the day'' Sunday,according to his press secretary, Sheila Tate, but he had no publiccomment.   ``Obviously, as we celebrate our great national holiday, ourhearts go out to the loved ones and families of those who werelost,'' Bush said at the Detroit airport.   The vice president dismissed any comparison between Sunday'sincident and the Soviet Union's downing of a Korean airliner thathad strayed into its airspace in 1983.   ``This plane was warned,'' Bush said. ``This plane was flying ina combat area. It's totally separate, totally different.''   Bush also said ``it appears the captain of the ship followed therules ... he did what he had to do.''   Likely Democratic nominee Dukakis, in Boston for IndependenceDay celebrations, called on the United States to lead aninternational effort to end the Iran-Iraq war.   ``This is no time for acts of terror or revenge in response tothe incident,'' Dukakis said. ``So I urge the government of Iran toreconsider its threats and to join us and the entire internationalcommunity in ending a war that already has taken the lives of morethan one million people.''   Jackson also called for an end to the eight-year-old war.   ``We in fact must move more quickly now to use our strength toget Iran and Iraq back to the negotiating table,'' said Jackson,interviewed on CBS-TV's ``This Morning'' program. ``We've not donethis as vigorously as we should have done it.''   Jackson, interviewed from his Chicago home, rejected suggestionsthat the U.S. withdraw from the troubled gulf.   ``We should not move out unilaterally. The fact is they areinternational waters. We do have a right to be there,'' saidJackson.   The Iranians said 290 people were aboard the Airbus, and allwere presumed dead. The Pentagon said the U.S. vessel that shotdown the jetliner believed it was under attack by a fighter plane.   Dukakis said Sunday in a statement from his home in Brookline,Mass., that he was ``saddened by the loss of life,'' but added:``Plainly, our armed forces have a right to defend themselves whenattacked.''   The Massachusetts governor was paying a Fourth of July visitthis morning at the USS Constitution in Charleston, Mass.   Later, Dukakis and his wife Kitty were to dine with Jackson andhis wife, Jacqueline. The two couples were then attending a holidayBoston Pops concert.   With the Democratic National Convention opening two weeks fromtoday, Jackson has not said whether he would accept a spot on theticket. However, he has said for weeks he deserves to be offeredthe vice presidential nomination.   The Dukakis campaign has been screening a number of prospectiverunning mates, and says Jackson is under consideration.   Jackson made another foray into Middle Eastern politics onSunday when he appealed Sunday to the captors of American andEuropean hostages in Lebanon to free their captives.   ``Their captivity has reminded us that none of us is free untilall of us are free. I appeal to you from the depths of my heart andsoul to let them go. Their release could create a breakthrough ofbetter understanding,'' he said in a message taped Sunday inChicago. A text was released in Washington.   The Jackson campaign said the tape would be distributed toLebanese news organizations, but provided no details.   In the message, Jackson made particular mention of TerryAnderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press,who is the longest held hostage. He was taken captive March 16,1985.   Jackson had no campaign appearances planned today.   Bush's trip today was taking him to Michigan, Illinois andMissouri. He was making appearances at several small-town holidaycelebrations, including a parade in Wyandotte, Mich. and anIndependence Day festival in Elmwood Park., Ill. He was alsoattending a barbecue in St. Louis.   In other developments over the holiday weekend:   _Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, chosen to deliver the speechnominating Dukakis at the Democratic National Convention, said hehoped to introduce the Massachusetts governor to millions of voters.   ``A lot of people are really going to be looking at him veryclosely for the first time in this convention,'' Clinton said.Dukakis campaign officials announced Saturday in Boston thatClinton would deliver the nominating speech.   _Television evangelist Pat Robertson, who called off his bid forthe Republican nomination earlier this year, said Bush has askedhim to help bring Robertson supporters into the fold. Robertsonsaid he had volunteered to campaign for Bush, especially in stateswhere he had beaten out the vice president.   _ Ann Richards, who will give the keynote address at theDemocratic convention, said voters in her home state of Texasconsider Bush ``sort of silly'' and unable to understand the needsof working Americans. Richards, the Texas state treasurer who waspicked last week to give the convention-opening address, said onCBS-TV's ``Face the Nation'' that in her speech, she would talkabout ``American families (and) their concerns.''</TEXT></DOC>
