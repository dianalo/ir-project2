The court said it will decide in a case from Vermont whether thelaw unconstitutionally deprives some property owners of the use oftheir land without providing ``just compensation.''   Vermont Railroad Inc. in 1975 discontinued service over a1.7-mile stretch of its North Burlington branch rail line inChittenden County, Vt.   Part of the rail line's right-of-way crosses property J. Pauland Patricia Preseault say they own. Vermont officials say thestate owns the land at issue.   If the Preseaults do own it, they have the right under state lawto use the property once rail service is discontinued and therailway's easement automatically discontinued.   But the National Trails System Act, as amended in 1983, allowsfor the maintenance of railroad rights-of-way for possible futurerailroad use _ so-called railbanking _ while permitting suchrights-of-way to be used as nature trails.   Vermont entered into a lease with the city of Burlington underwhich the city will maintain the right-of-way as a trail whilepreserving it for possible rail use.   Citing the state-city agreement, the Interstate CommerceCommission rejected the Preseaults' attempt to have the rail linedeclared officially abandoned.   The Preseaults appealed the commission's action, but the 2ndU.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected their arguments that thefederal trails act violates the Constitution's Fifth Amendment,which bars the ``taking'' of private property without justcompensation.   The justices were told that some 10,000 miles of railroadright-of-way have been abandoned since 1985.   The case is Preseault vs. ICC, 88-1076.</TEXT></DOC>
