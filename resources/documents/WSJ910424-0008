Money Fund That Isn't   ----   By Georgette Jasen   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>04/24/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE C1</SO><IN>MUTUAL AND MONEY-MARKET FUNDS (FND)</IN><NS>MUTUAL FUNDS (FND)</NS><LP>   The next new wrinkle in money-market mutual funds may notreally be a money fund.   As a way to offer higher returns to investors, some fundcompanies are considering offering funds that wouldn't meetnew Securities and Exchange Commission regulations governingthe maturity and credit quality of the investments inmoneyfund portfolios.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Not a short-term bond fund, not a money fund, butsomething in between,&quot; says Edward Taber, director of thetaxable fixed-income division at T. Rowe Price Associates inBaltimore. Says Neal Litvack, marketing vice president forFidelity Investments, the Boston-based mutual fund giant:&quot;We're looking at a whole range of possibilities.&quot;   Fund officials say not to expect anything until fall. Theywant to see what happens when the new SEC rules, which havebeen in the works for almost a year, finally take effect inJune. &quot;It's extremely preliminary,&quot; says Mr. Taber, &quot;andthere may be nothing at all.&quot;   Still, there's already one fund that others may be lookingat as something of a model: Neuberger andamp; Berman's Money MarketPlus fund. The fund, which was started in 1986, recentlychanged its name to the Ultra Short Bond Fund in response tothe new regulations. Its investments are all top-rated andconsist largely of Treasury bills and short-term governmentagency securities. But with an average maturity of 220 days,well beyond the 90 days specified in the new regulations, thefund doesn't meet the SEC's requirements for usingmoney-market in its name.   The fund's current average maturity compares with anaverage of 56 days at taxable money funds.   That doesn't make any real difference in safety, saysStanley Egener, president of Neuberger andamp; Berman ManagementInc. &quot;The risk differential is de minimus.&quot;   But the longer average maturity of the Neuberger andamp; Bermanfund tends to generate a better return for investors. For the12 months ended March 31, for instance, the Neuberger andamp;Berman fund posted a total return of 8.55%, compared with7.47% for the average money fund, according to LipperAnalytical Services, a New York firm that tracks mutualfunds.   Even before the new SEC regulations were adopted, theNeuberger andamp; Berman fund usually wasn't listed among moneyfunds, not only because of its long average maturity but alsobecause its net asset value rises and falls with the value ofits portfolio.   SEC regulations require that money funds maintain a&quot;stable&quot; net asset value; typically, funds keep it at $1, soonly the yield varies. The Neuberger andamp; Berman fund's currentnet asset value is about $10 a share.   Money Market Plus wasn't designed to appeal to averagemoney fund investors, Mr. Egener says, adding that itsaverage account size, between $35,000 and $40,000, indicatesthat most shareholders are institutional investors or &quot;fairlysophisticated&quot; individuals. Neuberger andamp; Berman also has threemoney funds -- one general purpose, one that invests only ingovernment securities and a tax-free fund.   &quot;This is not a place to park money for a month or two,it's a place to park it for a year or two,&quot; Mr. Egener says.   That's exactly the market some other mutual fund companieswant to tap. &quot;The fund industry has achieved some nicepenetration in the {bank and thrift} moneymarket accountarea, but banks and thrifts have done a nice job holding onto the certificate of deposit market,&quot; says Mr. Taber of T.Rowe Price. &quot;A product that would be more competitive withCDs could make sense.&quot;   But while CDs carry federal deposit insurance up to$100,000, mutual funds don't. Because of the way they arestructured, however, money funds are considered among thesafest investments.   It was to ensure that such confidence isn't misplaced thatthe SEC adopted the new regulations. In addition toshortening the maximum allowable average maturity to 90 daysfrom 120, the regulations also tightened credit-qualitystandards, limiting investments in all but top-ratedsecurities to a maximum of 5% of the portfolio.   Already the new SEC regulations have started to smooth outdifferences among money funds. And as more and more fundsmove into full compliance, yields are likely to decline stillfurther. During the past two years, money fund yields havefallen to just under 6% from more than 9.5%, as short-terminterest rates have plummeted.   Those falling yields give fund companies an incentive todevelop new products to keep the money coming in. But a bigquestion is how much risk investors would be willing toaccept in return for higher yields. In the past two years,several money funds had to be bailed out by their parentcompanies to avoid shareholder losses when two commercialpaper issuers defaulted.   One big mutual fund company, Dreyfus Corp., says italready has considered and rejected a fund that would buymore lower quality paper after deciding it would have tocompromise credit quality to get significantly higher yields.&quot;You could be jeopardizing yourself and the industry,&quot; saysJoseph DiMartino, Dreyfus president and manager of the firm'spopular Worldwide Dollar money fund and some of its othermoney funds, as well.   Other fund groups say they don't see a need for the newfunds. &quot;We give shareholders a pretty full menu to choosefrom,&quot; says Ian McKinnon, senior vice president of VanguardGroup in Valley Forge, Pa. Vanguard has a short-term bondfund with an average maturity of 474 days and a&quot;limited-term&quot; fund with a 2.9-year average maturity.   Fidelity's Mr. Litvack says that firm's research, andactual experience, indicate that it takes about 1.5percentage points of yield for shareholders to switch out ofmoney funds into other funds. Investor psychology is apt toplay a part, too. &quot;If money funds are yielding 10%, 11.5%might not look so great,&quot; Mr. Litvack says. &quot;The differencebetween 5% and 6.5% could mean a lot.&quot;   There already are funds being marketed as having thepotential for somewhat higher yields than money funds. Globalincome funds, for instance, invest in securities issuedoverseas, where interest rates are often sharply higher thanin the U.S. Adjustable-rate mortgage funds invest insecurities backed by adjustable-rate mortgages. Prime-ratefunds buy pieces of commercial loans and are designed tooffer a floating rate linked to the prime.   The share price on all these funds can fluctuate, thefunds present greater risks than those faced by investors inpure money funds.   &quot;For money fund investors, a fluctuating net asset valueis like crossing the Grand Canyon,&quot; says Mr. DiMartino. &quot;Thepublic is really concerned with safety and the integrity ofthe dollar price.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
