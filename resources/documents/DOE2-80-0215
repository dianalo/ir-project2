<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-80-0215 </DOCNO><TEXT>Progress of unmanned substations monitored by remote control systems isreviewed, and the requirements, especially a reliability and flexibility,for the automated control systems of substation facilities, the functionsassigned to the automated system and each independent equipment, andthe consideration to meet local circumstances in cases where the centralizedcontrol system for substations is planned are outlined. As examples ofthe automated system, the automated central remote monitoring and controlsystem in an integrated control station to monitor unmanned substations,and the in-house automated transformation facility control system ina manned super high voltage substation are presented. As for future automatedsystems, the total facility automation system which links uniformly betweenthe automated systems for power supply, transformation and distributionto supply stable power and to operate power systems efficiently, thetotal facility monitoring system with new sensors or an expert system,the advanced large capacity communication system, and the in-house opticalfiber LAN are described.
