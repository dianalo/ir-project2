The new firmwould be the second-largest in California, behind Gibson,Dunn andamp; Crutcher.   Pillsbury Madison and 171-lawyer Lillick andamp; McHose agreedto combine as of Jan. 1, 1991, in order to extend thegeographical reach of each firm and to fill in gaps in theirpractices.</LP><TEXT>   Pillsbury Madison, San Francisco's second-largest firm,has been building an office in Los Angeles. &quot;We wanted to getto a critical mass of about 200,&quot; said Pillsbury Madisonpartner Mary Cranston. The merger will increase the size ofits Los Angeles office to more than 160 from 42.   Lillick andamp; McHose lost its San Francisco branch in 1988when the entire 100-lawyer office split from the firm. Thefirm maintained that the split was necessary to eliminateconflicts of interest between clients of the two offices.Charles Patterson, Lillick andamp; McHose's managing partner, saidthat the firm hoped to strengthen the firm's generalcorporate and securities practices.   Although less than half the size of Pillsbury Madison, theLos Angeles firm is stronger financially. In 1989, Lillick andamp;McHose grossed $56 million, or $350,000 in profit perpartner, according to the Recorder, a San Francisco legaltrade publication. In comparison, Pillsbury Madison grossedabout $144 million, or $270,000 in profit per partner. Thenumbers were confirmed by someone familiar with thetransaction.   Last year, Pillsbury Madison revamped its compensationsystem and began an austerity campaign. Partners' pay for themonth of March was eliminated, secretaries were fired, andother services were cut. &quot;Our costs were higher than theyshould have been,&quot; said Ms. Cranston, citing the $13 millionprice tag on a new computer system.   The firm had also lost a handful of key partners tocompeting firms.   In Los Angeles, Lillick andamp; McHose was &quot;trying to competeagainst some very powerful firms,&quot; said Bradford Hildebrandt,a law firm consultant in Somerville, N.J., who consulted withboth firms on the merger. &quot;This gives Lillick a much largercritical mass to service its clients.&quot;   Mr. Hildebrandt said that the combined client bases of thetwo firms would produce few conflicts. Among PillsburyMadison's largest clients are Chevron Corp. and PacificTelesis Group. Lillick andamp; McHose's clients include SecurityPacific National Bank and a number of Japanese bankinginterests.   The new firm will use the name Pillsbury Madison SutroLillick andamp; McHose in Los Angeles, and Pillsbury, Madison andamp;Sutro in San Francisco.   ---   DISCRIMINATION AGAINST black homeowners alleged inlawsuit.   A redlining suit alleges that American Family MutualInsurance Co. discriminated against black property owners wholive in Milwaukee zip code areas with large minoritypopulations.   The suit, which seeks class action status, was filed lastweek in federal court in Milwaukee by the NationalAssociation for the Advancement of Colored People and severalblack Milwaukee residents. It alleges that the Madison, Wis.,insurer told its agents not to sell to blacks or to chargethem higher rates than whites. It charges that the companystereotyped blacks as likely to fail to make payments ontheir policies.   Redlining in the insurance industry &quot;appears to be goingon in nearly every major city,&quot; claims John Powell, legaldirector of the American Civil Liberties Union, which aidedin the preparation of the suit.   An American Family spokeswoman said the company hadn'treceived a copy of the suit, and therefore couldn't commenton specific allegations. &quot;But we don't discriminate, nor dowe condone discrimination,&quot; she said.   The suit includes two exhibits from a separate suit filedin Wisconsin state court two years ago by six white AmericanFamily agents who claimed they were wrongfully terminated bythe company. The agents alleged that discriminatory practicesby the company limited their ability to sell insurance. Theirclaims were dismissed, partly because they hadn't objectedinitially to the alleged discrimination, said an attorney forthe plaintiffs in the Milwaukee suit.   One exhibit from the state court case, a purportedtranscript of a tape-recording one of the agents made at ameeting with a manager, quotes the manager as saying: &quot;Yousell too many blacks. You gotta sell good, solid,premium-paying white people.&quot;   The second exhibit includes a handwritten note purportedlyfrom an American Family manager to an agent that criticizesthe agent's performance.   &quot;Quit writing all those blacks]] They are the reason foryour poor persistency]&quot; the note says.   ---   BOSTON LAWYERS lobby against a sales tax on legalservices.   The Massachusetts Bar Association and the Boston BarAssociation may challenge the constitutionality of a 5% levyon the fees of lawyers and other professional groups. Thelevy is part of a tax increase of as much as $1.6 billionrecently passed by the state Legislature.   The bar associations have retained Edward F. Hines Jr. ofthe Boston law firm of Choate Hall andamp; Stewart. TheMassachusetts bar has run advertisements in legalpublications alerting lawyers to the problems with the taxand urging them to contact their legislative representatives.   A Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruling upheld theconstitutionality of a business services sales tax but didnot address the constitutional issues surrounding a tax onlegal services, said Charles B. Swartwood III, president ofthe Massachusetts Bar Association.   &quot;I have a lot of problems believing that a person or acompany that is vindicating their rights or is compelled toget legal services can be taxed&quot; under the constitution, saidRudolph Pierce, president of the Boston bar.   But Jim Braude, executive director of the Tax EquityAlliance for Massachusetts, which supported the bill, saidthe tax package is constitutional and fair.   &quot;The bar is in the state house every day asking for moremoney for courts, judges' salaries and prison constructionand acknowledging the need for taxes. But the tag line is letsomeone else pay,&quot; Mr. Braude says.   ---   AMETEK PLEADS GUILTY to defense contract fraud charges.   Ametek Inc., based in Paoli, Pa., agreed to pay a $110,000criminal fine for withholding past pricing informationconcerning electronic sonar systems it built in the mid-1980sfor the U.S. Navy. In addition, Ametek agreed to pay $5.1million to settle potential civil claims related to the caseand faces possible suspension from future contracting withthe Department of Defense.   The agreement, reached with the U.S. attorney's office inSan Diego, is the second in a week in which a majorindustrial manufacturer has settled defense fraud chargeswith federal prosecutors. Last week, General Electric Co. wasordered to pay a $10 million criminal fine and agreed to payan additional $20 million to settle claims that it concealedmillions of dollars in cost reductions from the U.S. Armybetween 1983 and 1985.   No employees of Ametek were charged. Federal prosecutorscontended that Ametek's former Straza Division, in El Cajon,Calif., was under contract with the U.S. Navy as its solesource for the manufacture of ice and mine avoidance sonarsystems used aboard Trident nuclear submarines. As such,Ametek was required by the federal Truth in Negotiations Actto disclose all &quot;historical data&quot; concerning cost and pricinginformation.   Federal prosecutors maintained that the company built twosystems for $2.3 million and shipped them in 1986, thenwithheld labor and pricing information that would havelowered subsequent contract costs by about $2 million, saidAssistant U.S. Attorney Phillip L.B. Halpern, who helpedprosecute the case.   Ametek spun off its Straza division and 13 others in 1988to create Ketema Inc., which in turn has sold the marineproducts operations involved in the investigation, Ameteksaid. Ketema will reimburse Ametek for the $5.2 million itcost to settle the criminal and related civil investigationsand take a charge in its second quarter earnings.   ---   SOVIET LINKS: The New York law firm of Hall, Dickler,Lawler, Kent andamp; Friedman has brought in Burton L.
