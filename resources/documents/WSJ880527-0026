Sease and David Wilson </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> STK NDX </IN><TEXT>   Investors shrugged off potentially bad news about inflation and interest rates and bid up stock prices in moderate trading.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 5.38 to 1966.75. Advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange outpaced decliners by 787-592.    Yesterday's Big Board volume of 164.3 million shares included more than 35 million shares of Sears Roebuck, which rose 1/4 to 34 1/2 as big investors sought to capture its dividend.    The price gains came despite two pieces of news that many traders and money managers had thought would push stocks lower. First, the U.S. government revised the first-quarter gross national product growth rate to 3.9%, well above the original estimate of 2.3% and higher than the 3.2% many analysts were expecting. Market forecasters had said that if the number came in higher than expected, it would renew fears that inflation is heating up and that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to slow the economy.    The second piece of news was that the Fed apparently did raise rates slightly, setting a target range of 7 1/4% to 7 1/2% for federal funds, or money that banks lend one another overnight. Analysts said they expect the rate to climb further in coming weeks.    Yesterday's rise in stocks amid that kind of news therefore heartened market professionals.    &quot;I think we're seeing an ever-so-slight improvement in sentiment,&quot; said Dudley Eppel, a trader at Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette. &quot;Investors would have banged the hell out of the market if they had gotten this kind of news a week or two ago. They didn't, and that's got to be good news.&quot;    Steven A. Kroll, president of SLH Asset Management, said investors are turning away from technology and cyclical issues and toward interest-sensitive stocks such as utilities, insurers, money-center banks and savings and loans. He said that indicates that equity investors aren't so worried about an overheating economy.    &quot;Right now, there's a change in psychology from a strong growth to a weak growth outlook,&quot; he said.    Mr. Kroll said analsyts at SLH have detected &quot;a surprisingly pronounced slowdown&quot; in recent business activity at companies they follow.    Leo P. Grohowski, a portfolio manager at Marinvest, a subsidiary of Marine Midland Bank, said he doesn't think a little further tightening by the Fed will upset equity investors.    &quot;If it's done in an orderly fashion, the market can handle a little snugging by the Fed,&quot; he said. &quot;What you don't want is headlines screaming, 'Fed Slams on the Brakes.'&quot;    Mr. Grohowski said he thinks the strong corporate earnings reported for the first quarter put a floor under stock prices. Otherwise, he said, the recent bearish sentiment and paring of equity holdings by many money managers would have driven stocks still lower. But he said it will take lower interest rates to spark a real rally in stocks.    &quot;The earnings part of the price-to-earnings equation is providing a floor, but we need some falling interest rates to get the price part of the equation moving up,&quot; he said.    Texaco jumped 3 1/8 to 50 and was the Big Board's second most active issue, on composite volume of 5.7 million shares, in the wake of a $60-a-share takeover offer by investor Carl Icahn.    Institutions and arbitragers appeared split on whether Mr. Icahn's bid is a serious offer or a negotiating ploy as Texaco has charged, according to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report. Mr. Icahn, who already owns 14.8% of the oil giant, told the investor report he will &quot;definitely&quot; go through with a proxy fight if Texaco rejects his request to allow holders to vote on the offer.    USX, in which Mr. Icahn has an 11.4% stake, advanced 1 to 30 1/2. Among other blue-chips, Merck added 1 to 51 after a 3-for-1 stock split, General Motors slipped 1/2 to 72 7/8, and International Business Machines fell 1/4 to 108 1/4.    Long Island Lighting gained 1 1/4 to 11 3/8 on volume of 4.8 million shares. Lilco reached a tentative agreement with New York state under which the utility would abandon its Shoreham nuclear power plant and the state would drop its acquisition proposal.    Upjohn, which jumped 2 1/8 Wednesday amid speculation over a possible $45-a-share takeover offer from Du Pont, rose 3/8 to 31 5/8 on volume of 2.2 million shares. Du Pont has declined to comment on the speculation.    Newhall Land andamp; Farming soared 4 3/8 to 44 1/2 after rising 3 7/8 the day before. The advance followed disclosures in The Wall Street Journal that the partnership in recent months had received two overtures from its largest unit holder about a leveraged buy-out and that a number of investors had expressed interest in a possible takeover.    AGS Computers, which said it has held preliminary discussions with several potential acquirers, jumped 3 7/8 to 25. Several traders told the investor report there were rumors that one of the Bell operating companies is interested in making a bid. Bell Atlantic, which one trader named as a possible suitor, declined to comment.    U.S. Shoe fell 7/8 to 17 7/8 in heavy trading. The company posted net income of seven cents a share for its first quarter, ended April 30. It had operating profit of 18 cents a share a year earlier.    Commercial Credit, the newest member of the Sandamp;P 500, rose 1 1/8 to 24 1/2. The stock succeeds IMS International, which has been acquired by Dun andamp; Bradstreet, on the list.    Quaker State climbed 3 1/8 to 23 7/8. Rumors circulated that Ardshiel, a New York investment bank, had lined up financing for a proposed acquisition of the motor oil maker. An Ardshiel spokesman said, &quot;I cannot comment at this time.&quot;    American Stock Exchange volume was 8,489,800 shares, compared with 7,997,930 Wednesday. There were 279 issues advancing, 264 declining and 252 unchanged. The American Stock Exchange index gained 1.48 to 292.06.    Semtech gained 5/8 to 3 5/8. It said operating profit for its first quarter, ended May 1, jumped to 20 cents a share from four cents a year earlier.    Manufactured Homes rose 1/2 to 8 5/8. It reached an agreement that will allow it to sell an unlimited amount of insured mortgage loan contracts to Huntington National Bank, Columbus, Ohio. </TEXT></DOC>
