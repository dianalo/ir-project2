The Commerce Department said the October deficit was 19.8percent higher than the September imbalance of $8.51 billion.   The worsening trade balance reflected a big jump in imports,which climbed 5.1 percent, to an all-time high of $41.21 billion.   U.S. exports were also up, by 1.1 percent, rising to $31.01billion. The trade deficit is the difference between imports andexports.   A worsening in the trade deficit had been expected, given thefact that imports normally shoot up in October as merchants restockshelves in preparation for Christmas. However, the size of theincrease caught many economists by surprise.   For the first 10 months of the year, the U.S. merchandise tradedeficit is running at an annual rate of $109.4 billion, down amodest 7.7 percent from last year's deficit of $118.53 billion.   The overall October deficit of $10.20 billion was the largestsince a $10.80 billion deficit in December 1988, although theAugust imbalance of $10.10 billion was nearly as high.   In brighter economic news, wholesale prices, held down by asharp drop in gasoline prices, dipped 0.1 percent in November forthe third decline in five months, the government said today.   The drop in the Labor Department's Producer Price Index, whichmeasures prices of goods one stop short of the retail level,brought the annual rate of inflation for the first 11 months of theyear down to 4.6 percent, compared with 4 percent for all of 1988.   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater saidthat, despite the October rise in the trade deficit, the deficitfor January through October was $91.2 billion, ``down $6 billionfrom the trade deficit for the first 10 months of 1988.''   ``So it's still moving in the right direction,'' he said.``We're doing exactly the right thing and now changes are necessaryat this time.''   On wholesale prices, Fitzwater said the decline for November was``another example that inflation is low and under control.''   Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve Board said industrial productionedged up 0.1 percent in November as the economy rebounded from theeffects of the Boeing aircraft strike and the San FranciscoBay-area earthquake that were largely responsible for a 0.6 percentdrop a month earlier.   In another report, the Fed said the operating rate of thenation's factories, mines and utilities edged down 0.1 percentagepoint to 82.7 percent in November, its lowest rate since April 1988.   Many economists are looking for very little improvement in thetrade imbalance in the coming year, a forecast which would spelltrouble for the U.S. manufacturing sector, already suffering joblosses because of weakening sales.   The Bush administration is likely to come under growing pressurein Congress to erect trade barriers in an effort to stop the floodof imports into the country.   As usual, the biggest deficit in October was recorded withJapan, an imbalance of $4.9 billion, almost half of the total forthe month, as imports from Japan hit a record level.   Other large deficits included a $1.28 billion imbalance withTaiwan, an $843 million deficit with Canada and a $783 milliondeficit with China.   The Soviet Union continued to be one of the few countries withwhich the United States enjoys a trade surplus, with the Octobersurplus totaling $123.2 million.   The poor trade showing in October reflected import gains in avariety of areas.   America's foreign oil bill shot up 8.5 percent to $4.38 billionas the price per barrel rose 71 cents to $17.09 while the number ofbarrels imported daily held basically steady at 8.26 million.   Imports of agricultural products shot up 18 percent to $2.24billion while imports of industrial supplies were up 14 percent to$11.7 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
