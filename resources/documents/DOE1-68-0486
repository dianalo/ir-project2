<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-68-0486 </DOCNO><TEXT>To develop operational methods for using multi-spectral scanner data inthe diagnosis, classification and presentation of forest damage is theoverriding aim of the research project 'Investigation and mapping offorest decline by remote-sensing methods', a project started in early1986 at 'Deutsche Forschungs- und Versuchsanstalt fuer Luft- und Raumfahrt(DFVLR)'. Its long-term target is to map forest damage by remote-sensingsatellite. 'Operational' in this context means that classification methods- including digital image processing - should be standardized to an extentpermitting both DFVLR and the scientific institutes concerned, and theauthorities of the Federal and Laender Governments to use them routinelyfor large-scale recording of forest damage. The method adopted is brieflyexplained. (orig./KG)</TEXT></DOC>
