 However, a patentis not intended to stifle a technology but rather to allowlicensing to those who can use it.andP;  A patent protects a technologyand puts a market price on it, and because it is part of thepublic record, the core technology is available to those who wantto improve on it.andP;  There are several arguments against softwarepatents, including the belief that fundamental truths and physicallaws should be held in the public domain, yet few argue therationale that drugs are proprietary.andP;  The difference in softwareis the collegiality of the industry, evidenced by the eagerness toshare new ideas.andP;  Yet, if the the software industry was notprotected by the same rules that govern other industries, it wouldbe hard to attract and compete for the best scientific talent.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     PatentSoftware ProtectionLicensingAnalysis.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Patents needed in an imperfect worldandM;Imagine a world where cars run forever without gasoline, where food has nocalories and where the free exchange of ideas without supervision is how wespend our working hours.andP;  In this perfect worled, treading on each others'real or intangible property is not an issue.andM;I have become enamored of this vision of utopia through reading, but when Iclose my book, pollution, weight gain and bosses are still a reality.andP;  And ina society as flawed as the one in which we live, defending ourselves and ourproperty presents a very real dilemma.andM;For those of us in the software industry, protecting our property meansprotecting our software.andP;  More specifically, it means patenting our software,a concept that many normally level-headed computer users insist obstructs thecosmic flow of information.andM;The purpose of a patent is not to stifle a technology but rather to allowlicensing to those who can use it.andP;  Now that our company has been issued apatent, licensees are protected.andP;  Companies of any size will find that wewant to work with them, not see them in court.andP;  The patent protects thetechnology and puts a market price on it rather than hiding it from theworld.andP;  The patent itself is part of the public record, so that others whowant to improve on it have the core technology available.andP;  We only ask thatthey work with us, the inventors, so that our cost in thousands of hours anddollars is not in vain.andM;One argument against software patents is that the act of simply automating amanual process should not be proprietary.andP;  Yet Edison and Ford automatedprocesses of lighting and transportation that already existed.andP;  What'sdifferent about software?andM;Another argument against patenting is that fundamental truths and physicallaws should be held in the public domain.andP;  Yet few argue over the rationalethat drugs, into which pharmaceutical companies pour time and money, areproprietary.andP;  What's different about software?andM;Other critics wave the flag of independent, simultaneous development,claiming that patent protection introduces a potential &quot;mine field&quot; fordevelopers.andP;  However, a patent is issued only when an inventor demonstratesthat his product or process is both unique and important.andP;  The race for whoearns this right is exciting, but competing patents are relatively rare.andM;A patent guarantees that a big company will not step on the little guy.andO;Conversely, big companies that invest in technology and come up withimpressive new widgets or algorithms should have some control over theirdestinies.andP;  Licensing agreements let those who are willing to pay for thetechnology share it, ensuring that patented material flows efficiently to themarketplace.andP;  This mine field exists in manufacturing as well as in most Randamp;Dand is considered to be part of the cost of doing business.andP;  Wht's differentabout software?andM;What is different about software in general, and Macintosh software inparticular, is the collegiality of the industry.andP;  Programmers, even amongcompeting companies, are proud enough to want to share their new ideas andprogress on specific projects.andP;  Many are also humble and smart enough to knowthat idea sharing helps inspire them through creative blocks.andP;  Patents dolittle to stifle innovation; by the time a project is far enough along tofile a patent application, the creative process is complete.andM;It's important to keep in mind that obtaining a patent is slow and difficult.andO;An idea is not patentable.andP;  Only very well-developed processes or productscan be granted 17 years of immunity from competition -- and only then if thepatent is successfully defended.andP;  Yet the legal strength of patents generallyscares away many frivolous claimants in a way that copyrights do not.andP;  Thepatent office takes years (three, for us) to study, research and spar withthe applicant.andM;If the software business was not guarded by the same rules that apply toother enterprises, it would be unable to attract and compete for the bestscientific talent.andP;  Our product, DocuComp, automates a tedious,mistake-ridden manual process (red lining, or comparing documents) with acomplicated pattern-recognition scheme and a set of expert rules.andP;  Theprogrammer, Cary Queen, is a ph.D.andP;  mathematician and a leading molecularbiologist who maintains that inventing this algorithm is the hardest thing hehas ever done.andP;  Queen never would have spent the time away from otherprojects (he is the chief scientist at two other technology companies) tocreate DocuComp without expectation for its commercialization.andM;No developer wants to pay patent attorneys protection money to help ensurethat his or her investment in time and effort is shielded from intellectualhoodlums.andP;  Unfortunately, this mine fields is a necessary evil and anintegral part of a level playing field.andP;  Proceeding without knowing whetheryour work can be safeguarded is a more dangerous threat.andP;  The straightforwardapproach of trading access to technology for a suit of armor is fair andwell-tested.andP;  Patent law helps keep order so that everyone follows the rules.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
