A relation between theform factor and the renormalization properties of contour integrals ofthe gauge potential is found. A renormalization-group equation for theinfrared asymptotics of the quark form factor is formulated basing onthat relation. A solution of this equation is compared with the resultscalculated in lowest orders of perturbation theory.</TEXT></DOC>
