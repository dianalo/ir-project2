Mrs. Sisulu, 71, and her family have become a symbol of thestruggle of South Africa's blacks against apartheid.   Bush extended an invitation to Mrs. Sisulu to visit the UnitedStates last month after he met with Bishop Desmond Tutu and otheranti-apartheid leaders at the White House.   ``The president will recognize her for her courageous personalstruggle for human rights and dignity,'' Fitzwater said.   Mrs. Sisulu, a nurse by profession, is one of three jointpresidents of the United Democratic Front, treasurer of the Women'sLeague of the outlawed African National Congress and a founder ofthe Federation of South African Women.   Her husband, Walter Sisulu, has been serving a jail sentencesince 1964 for helping found the guerrilla arm of the AfricanNational Congress along with its jailed leader, Nelson Mandela.   Two of her five children have fled into exile to avoid arrest,and Mrs. Sisulu has served various jail terms and been under housearrest and other government restrictions for 18 years.   The government of South Africa gave her a 31-day passport to makethe visit, the first time she has been allowed out of the country.   Bush has opposed further economic sanctions against the minoritywhite-ruled government of South Africa, other than the limitedsanctions his predecessor, Ronald Reagan, was forced to impose byCongress in 1986 over his veto.   But Bush has endorsed a more forceful U.S. role in pressing foran end apartheid and political rights to South Africa's blacks, whooutnumber the whites, 28 million to 5 million.   Secretary of State James A. Baker III is scheduled to meet herewith month with F.W. De Klerk, who is expected to assume hiscountry's president later this year.   It will be the first official visit by a South African governmentleader to this capital in 30 years.</TEXT></DOC>
