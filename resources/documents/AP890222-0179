ROSENTHAL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The former House intelligence committeechairman testified Wednesday at Oliver North's trial that he reliedon White House denials of reports of U.S. military help to theNicaragua Contras for more than a year until the Iran-Contra affairbecame known.   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., the first prosecution witness, saidthen-National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane twice denied anyinvolvement in letters in 1985 and at a committee briefing that year.   A year later Hamilton and his committee directly questionedNorth, then an aide on the National Security Council staff aboutwhether he had violated the Boland Amendment, a 1984 prohibitionagainst U.S. military aid to the Contras.   ``Colonel North insisted he had not violated the BolandAmendment, that he was not assisting the Contras by raising money,that he had not provided any military advice to the Contras,''Hamilton said of the Aug. 6, 1986 meeting in the White Housesituation room.   ``I relied on what Colonel North told me at the meeting,''Hamilton said. ``I believed what Colonel North told me at themeeting. I did not think there was any credible evidence to thecontrary.''   North was originally charged with conspiracy in the allegedscheme to divert money from Iran arms sales to aid the NicaraguanContras. That charge was dropped and he is on trial on 12 felonycharges that include obstructing congressional inquiries into hisactivities in 1985 and 1986.   The committee's inquiries were first made in August 1985following news reports that North was helping raise money for theContras and giving them tactical military advice _ despite the 1984amendment.   ``When McFarlane told me they were not engaged in raising fundsfor the Contras and that the National Security Council was notproviding military advice ... I took Mr. McFarlane's word for it. Irelied upon what the national security adviser for the presidenttold me.''   Hamilton said he thought that information was ``accurate, honestand correct'' and did not pose questions about the Contras to theCIA or the Defense Department.   He told the court that Congress was disturbed in November 1986when it learned the United States had sold arms to Iran ``because itran counter to policy.''   ``We were telling all the world we do not sell arms to terroristnations,'' he said. ``If this was true we were dealing with aterrorist nation. We were telling the world we did not deal forhostages but if this was true we did make concessions to gethostages.   ``The sale of arms to Iran violated all we understood to be thepolicy of the U.S. government.''   Prosecutors are trying to show that North, then a Marinelieutenant colonel serving on the NSC staff, subverted the processesof government by helping McFarlane draft false answers to lettersfrom Congress inquiring about the news reports. McFarlane, who isexpected to testify as a prosecution witness, has pleaded guilty tofour misdemeanor counts of withholding information from Congress.   Hamilton will return for more testimony Thursday. The nextwitness will be Adolfo Calero, the political head of the largestContra faction, the Nicaraguan Democratic Force.   During Hamilton's testimony, North's wife, Betsy, sat in thefront row of spectator seats and North wrote on a yellow legal pad.   Before the jury was admitted to the courtroom, Hamilton wascautioned not to refer in any way to the public testimony North gavein 1987 at a televised hearing of the House-Senate committeeslooking into the Iran-Contra affair.   North had immunity for that appearance and his trial must beconducted entirely without information gleaned from his earliertestimony. Hamilton's testimony, said U.S. District Judge Gerhard A.Gesell ``must be solely on what you know of your own knowledge.''   Hamilton, whose committee has oversight over the nation'sintelligence agencies _ it hears testimony in a specially secureroom in the Capitol _ said he was not satisfied with the officialassurances that North and other NSC aides were not vioating theBoland ban on military aid to the Contras.   Two months after North denied to the committee that he wasviolating the Boland amendment, an American C-123 cargo planecrashed during a supply flight to the Contras in Nicaragua. Hamiltonsaid he learned about the crash in the press. Of the three menaboard, one, Eugene Hasenfus, survived and said he had been workingfor the CIA.   ``It caused an enormous stir and concern in Washington andparticularly in Congress,'' the congressman said. ``Some membersperceived it as a possible violation of the Boland Amendment.''   Hamilton dismissed a suggestion by Brendan V. Sullivan, North'schief defense lawyer, that the Boland Amendment did not apply to theNational Security Council, a claim North and the White House havemade in the past.   ``I do not recall anyone saying to me this language does notapply to the National Security Council,'' Hamilton said. ``Theletter Mr. McFarlane wrote to me specifically said that the languagedid apply and I accepted that.''   But Hamilton conceded that ``I do not read that language asapplying to the president of the United States'' provided the chiefexecutive does not use the CIA, the Defense Department or otherintelligence agencies to aid the Contras.</TEXT></DOC>
