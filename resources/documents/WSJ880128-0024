Sease </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> STK NDX </IN><TEXT>   Automated sell programs took the bloom off a morning rally yesterday, leaving the Dow Jones Industrial Average down nearly 10 points in moderately active trading.    The industrial average closed at 1911.14, off 9.45. But broader market indices were about flat, and advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered decliners, 824 to 706. Volume totaled 176.4 million shares, up from 138.4 million shares traded Tuesday.    Stock prices climbed in concert with bonds early in the trading session yesterday, buoyed by the government's report that fourth-quarter gross national product grew at an annual rate of 4.2%, mostly on a buildup of inventories. But computerized sell programs executed shortly after noon sent the industrial average down sharply into negative territory, where it remained for the rest of the session.    &quot;We had a decent market going for a while, then the sell programs kicked in,&quot; said John Burnett, a trader for Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette. &quot;I thought that with the GNP numbers and the bond market up that stocks would have acted better, but I guess people just don't trust the market.&quot;    Michael Metz, an investment strategist at Oppenheimer andamp; Co., said the GNP report was a case of &quot;bad news is good news&quot; for stock prices. He said that because much of the growth in GNP came from involuntary inventory building, the part of the economy relating to final demand is growing sluggishly. Therefore, he predicted, the Federal Reserve will move quickly to stimulate final demand by loosening the money supply, which should result in faster economic growth in the second quarter.    &quot;A slowdown now is the most bullish of all possible situations,&quot; he said, &quot;assuming it doesn't degenerate into a recession.&quot;    However, Mr. Metz acknowledged that plenty of experts are worried by the inventory buildup evident in yesterday's GNP report. &quot;The bulls say it's just a minor inventory adjustment that will be over by the middle of the year, but the bears say it's the beginning of a lasting recession,&quot; he said.    Regardless of what investors read into the GNP figures, the burst of automated selling shortly after noon frightened many of them away. &quot;You have a very low conviction level, and when the market starts to ease, buyers simply run away,&quot; said Mr. Metz. &quot;They're afraid program trading will touch off another free fall and they've been through that before.&quot;    Much of the twists and turns that have marked the stock market in the past few weeks are attributed to pressures on the big capitalization stocks, he said. &quot;Program trading is having a large impact on big capitalization stocks and at the same time there's a split of opinion between pension funds and other investors,&quot; he explained. &quot;The conservative pension funds are going into bonds while the entrepreneurial and performance-oriented (mutual) funds are going toward stocks. That results in sporadic pressure on the big capitalization stocks.&quot;    American Standard soared 20 7/8 to 58 7/8 following Black andamp; Decker's $56-a-share bid for the company. Black andamp; Decker slid 7/8 to 19 1/2.    Monsanto shot up 4 3/4 to 83 1/2 after it said it developed a low-calorie, low-cholesterol fat substitute that won't need regulatory approval. The product, called Simplesse, could reach the market within 12 to 18 months.    Monsanto's announcement followed Procter andamp; Gamble's acknowledgement that it met Tuesday with the Food andamp; Drug Administration to answer questions regarding its Olestra fat substitute, which must obtain FDA approval. Procter, which lost 1/2 to 84 1/4, said the meeting was &quot;very productive.&quot; Olestra won't be ready for market for at least two years, analysts said. Procter also reported a gain in fourth-quarter net income yesterday.    International Business Machines rose 7/8 to 112 3/4 amid gossip that the company might change its leadership and expand its share buy-back program. An IBM spokeswoman said the speculation &quot;is rumor and filled with errors.&quot; She wouldn't say what the errors were.    Primerica rose 1 1/4 to 26 1/2. The company said it and A.L. Williams are negotiating to expand and strengthen the relationships between the two companies.    Texaco lost 7/8 to 35 7/8. It said in an amended disclosure statement filed yesterday that it would report a loss of about $4.9 billion in 1987, considerably more than the $2.79 billion it estimated it would lose in a statement filed late last year. Also, the Internal Revenue Service said in a hearing yesterday that it wouldn't seek to resolve a claim estimated at $6.5 billion against Texaco during the company's bankruptcy-law proceedings.    Georgia Gulf fell 1 3/4 to 51 1/4. The company acknowledged that it has temporarily lost phenol production at its Plaquemine, La., unit because of an explosion Monday. The company said insurance would cover any losses, including those from the interruption of its business.    Santa Fe Southern Pacific rose 1 1/2 to 47 1/2. Late Tuesday the company declared a special dividend of $30 a share and said it intends to cut its annual dividend to 10 cents from $1.    Public Service Co. of New Hampshire slid 5/8 to 2 5/8 after New Hampshire's Supreme Court effectively barred an emergency rate increase. The court's decision virtually assures that the utility will have to file for bankruptcy-law protection.    Coastal Corp. gained 1/2 to 30 after disclosing late Tuesday that it held preliminary discussions with some foreign oil producers concerning the possible sale of a half interest in Coastal's domestic refining and marketing operations.    Foster Wheeler closed up 1/4 at 14 1/4. It said investor Asher B. Edelman had proposed a meeting to discuss a recapitalization plan and the possible acquisition of Foster Wheeler for $16.50 a share.    Allegis lost 5/8 to 69. The company's board will meet today to discuss a promised $3 billion payout to shareholders amid speculation that the amount might be lowered. Allegis' largest shareholder, Coniston Partners, said it will launch a proxy fight to oust management if the payout is reduced.    Bristol-Myers gained 1/2 to 42 7/8 after disclosure of a study indicating that aspirin cuts the chances of a heart attack sharply. The study used the company's Bufferin brand aspirin. </TEXT></DOC>
