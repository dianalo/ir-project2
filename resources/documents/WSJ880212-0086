Bob Dole now plans to be &quot;nice to everybody.&quot; Richard Gephardt said Mike Dukakis doesn't understand the &quot;complexities of trade policy.&quot; Mr. Gephardt, however, has even more intriguing thoughts on this issue. He has now taken to pointing out that his trade policies are under attack by Gov. Dukakis, the Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal. And he identifies this cabal as &quot;the Eastern Establishment.&quot; This is a rare event indeed, but we welcome Mr. Dukakis and the Post over here on the side of free trade, which we hearby christen the Establishment position. </TEXT></DOC>
