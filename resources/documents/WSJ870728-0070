This marks the first time in a decade that the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants has rebuffed federal regulators' requests to abolish what regulators feel are anti-competitive practices of accountants.    Since 1977, the institute -- under pressure from federal regulators on antitrust grounds -- has eliminated bans against advertising, competitive bidding and uninvited solicitation of clients. Regulators also are trying to upset state rules or laws retaining such bans.    After a two-year investigation involving subpoenaing 18,000 documents of the institute, the Federal Trade Commission recently asked the institute to eliminate its ban on contingent fees for work that doesn't involve audits, the institute said. &quot;We're not going to go along this time, but will let the courts decide,&quot; said Donald J. Schneeman, the institute's general counsel.    Under the institute's current ethics rules, accountants generally are prohibited from providing services with the fee contingent upon benefits or profits they get for their clients. Accountants' fees are currently based on hourly rates.    &quot;Now we're prepared to fight to keep the government off our backs,&quot; Mr. Schneeman added. &quot;Many of our 250,000 members feel that increased competition has only eroded professional standards for independence and hurt their professional image.&quot;    Officials of the FTC publicly declined to comment on the investigation of the institute involving the contingent-fee ban. But privately they expressed surprise that the acccountants group is now throwing down the gauntlet on contingent fees after yielding for a decade to government pressure for increased competition.    &quot;There's no question this will cost both the institute and the government money involving hearings and legal fees over the next two years,&quot; said Mr. Schneeman. But he noted that some institute members have said that they would be willing to put up funds to fight the current FTC effort.    He noted that five years ago, the National Society of Professional Engineers spent $1.2 million unsuccessfully defending in court its ban against contingent fees. &quot;The engineers lost in the U.S. Supreme Court, but unlike engineers, accountants have a responsibility to the public when they audit their client companies. Many of our members feel that the ban against contingent fees helps accountants remain independent and objective.&quot;    In an FTC private antitrust investigation of a professional group, if an organization being investigated declines to follow the FTC staff's order, the organization can appeal to an administrative law judge and the full commission. If those appeals fail, the organization can turn to the courts, starting with a U.S. court of appeals.    The institute said it will suspend enforcement of its ban against contingent fees &quot;until a final resolution (of the matter) can be obtained, a period that could take longer than two years.&quot; Mr. Schneeman said that complaints during the period against CPA firms that violate the ban will be processed by the institute when the matter is resolved, if the courts support the ban.    If an institute member violates any ban in the institute's code of ethics, his membership in the institute can be suspended. This is considered a &quot;black mark&quot; that few CPA firms concerned about their reputation would want, Mr. Schneeman said. </TEXT></DOC>
