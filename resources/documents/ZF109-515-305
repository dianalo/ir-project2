(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Intricate, multilayered geometric designs.andP;  Complex engineering calculations.andO;Books full of engineering and construction rules.andP;  Steel beams, concrete,power equipment and tons of other elements that must show up where they'reneeded, at the right time, in the right amounts and in the proper sequence.andM;Stone andamp; Webster Engineering Corp. (Sandamp;W) must juggle them all when handlingits client's big-scale industrial construction projects.andP;  Such projects varywidely in size and duration.andP;  A typical job may require 250 to 600 people forthree to five years and the generation of 6,000 to 12,000 drawings.andP;  Sandamp;W is asubsidiary of the New York-based Stone andamp; Webster Inc.andM;Five years ago, in-house systems integrators in Sandamp;W's Advanced SystemsDevelopment Services unit began looking for a way to simplify things and toprovide tighter links between the design and construction staff.andP;  Result: Sandamp;Wnow possesses a system that integrates engineering andconstruction-management information.andP;  Consider these system features:andM;* 3-D CAD programs whose geometric databases are used throughout a projectcycle including the design, engineering, construction andfacilities-management phases;andM;* Fast computer graphics workstations that efficiently run the 3-D CADprograms;andM;* A mainframe-based relational database management system (RDBMS) that storesnon-geometric project information such as component delivery dates andoperational data;andM;* Microcomputers that give clients, vendors and contractors access tointegrated project databases;andM;* Software for structural analysis and other engineering calculations;andM;* An expert system that codifies basic engineering and construction rules;andM;* Networks that enable geographically dispersed engineers to work on the sameproject and to exchange project information with construction-site managers.andM;IBM Corp. hardware and software play a prominent role in this system.andP;  Buteven this computer giant couldn't provide all the components.andP;  Other vendorsinclude Autodesk Inc., CADAM Inc., Calma Co., Computervision, DassaultSystemes USA, Data General Corp., Digital Equipment Corp. and IntergraphCorp. CADAM is now a subsidiary of IBM, while Calma and Computervision havebeen folded into Prime Computer Inc.andM;Sandamp;W integrators wrote interfaces for several parts of the system, including3-D geometric databases and a centralized project database.andM;Local area networks (LANs) from DEC, Banyan Systems Inc. and Novell Inc.andO;connect workstations in individual Sandamp;W offices around the country.andP;  The LANs,in turn, are tied to TI services that use IBM's Systems Network Architecture(SNA) protocols.andP;  TI lines link regional offices to Sandamp;W's Bostonheadquarters.andP;  And 56K-bps (bits per second) dedicated telephone lines tieconstruction-site computers with regional offices.andP;  Data compressiontechnology from October Communications Corp. helps speed up transmissions onthe TI network.andM;What needed changingandM;There were three main reasons Sandamp;W radically redesigned the system.andM;1.andP;  To provide a stronger link between design and construction.andP;  &quot;By theearly 1980s, it was clear that we were not getting enough value from our 2-DCAD systems,&quot; says Ken Reinschmidt, president of Sandamp;W Advanced SystemsDevelopment Services.andP;  &quot;Such CAD systems give you clean-looking drawings, butthey don't help much when it comes to construction projects.andP;  Only 7 percentof a structure's cost typically goes for engineering and architecturalfunctions; 90 percent goes for construction.andP;  Drawings should be a means toan end.&quot;andM;2.andP;  To improve the `take-off' process.andP;  Material and labor requirements for aproject are traditionally calculated manually from data laboriously taken offdrawings developed on CAD systems.andP;  Such data might include the amount ofpiping, structural steel and concrete required for a project.andM;Calculations derived from take-off data are important in tracking costs,planning material purchases and scheduling material sequence at aconstruction site.andP;  &quot;It wasn't rational for a designer to create a drawing onthe screen, then generate a piece of paper that everyone else needed toobtain material and labor information,&quot; says Reinschmidt.andP;  &quot;We wanted to giveother people besides designers access to the CAD system.andP;  That would automatethe takeoff process.&quot;andM;3.andP;  To eleminate plastic models.andP;  In traditional design operations, engineersproduce 2-D drawings and schematics of their part of a project.andP;  Afterdrafting is complete, a 3-D solid plastic model of the entire structureusually is built.andP;  This model costs hundreds of thousands of dollars.andM;Such models help construction managers visualize and plan constructionsequences.andP;  They also reveal any obstructions among components that could beinadvertently incorporated into project drawings.andM;But plastic models only show a facility as it appears after construction.andP;  Amodel cannot be easily taken apart to show the sequence of construction stepsor be easily adapted to ongoing changes.andP;  Models are fragile and quite large.andO;Even at the 1:16 scale typically used, a 320-foot high industrial plant wouldrequire warehouse-sized space to store the 20-foot high model.andM;Install 3-D graphicsandM;Sandamp;W integrators asked: Why not base the whole project on 3-D graphics modelsto begin with? Reinschmidt agreed: &quot;We decided to build an integrateddesign-construction database architecture that used 3-D computer graphicsfrom start to completion of a project.&quot; That would eliminate the problems ofplastic models and carry many other benefits as well.andM;So, Sandamp;W sought a 3-D modeling program that could be accessed by everyone witha &quot;need to know.&quot; It had to be fast and easy to learn.andP;  That meant featureslike an interactive menu.andP;  And the product had to work with powerfulengineering workstations capable of generating and manipulating 3-D objectson the fly.andM;The winner was CATIA, developed by Dassault Systemes in France and marketedby IBM.andP;  CATIA uses primitive geometric solid objects (e.g.andP;  cylinders, conesand spheres) as the building blocks for structures with more complicatedshapes (e.g.andP;  air conditioners, motors, doors and windows).andM;Many aspects of 3-D modeling were vital for Sandamp;W:andM;* The model can be easily changed and rotated to any position, aidingdesigner productivity and creativity.andM;* The model has true 1: I scale.andP;  &quot;I can ask the computer to calculate actualquantities and properties (e.g.andP;  length, weight, volume and center ofgravity) of any object depicted,&quot; says Reinschmidt.andP;  &quot;You can't do that with2-D drawings on a computer.&quot;andM;* The designer can remove lines that normally form the back of displayedobjects.andP;  &quot;If such lines couldn't be deleted, you couldn't make heads ortails of the final design,&quot; notes Reinschmidt.andM;* The model highlights interferences among design components while the designis still on the screen.andP;  Corrections can take place early in the projectcycle, saving the embarrassment and cost of discovering these problems at theconstruction site.andM;* Anybody with a need to know can take computerized &quot;inspection tours&quot; of thefacility interior.andM;IBM's 5080 graphics workstations, along with some faster IBM 6090s, are thepredominant platform for Sandamp;W's 3-D programs.andP;  The company is deliberating amove from the 5080's to IBM RS/6000s.andP;  Machines used in previous stages ofSandamp;W's CAD operations-including those from DG, DEC and Intergraph-are tiedinto the new system.andM;Sandamp;W's STONEview software gives anybody with IBM ATs, PS/2s or compatiblemachines the ability to view and redline CAD images for later modifications.andO;Highlighted information can be displayed on workstations as overlays onoriginal drawings.andP;  An original cannot be directly changed by unauthorizedindividuals.andP;  No CAD training is required to use ST-ONEview.andM;Note: Sandamp;W has not entirely eliminated 2-D drawings.andP;  Not everybody at thecompany is comfortable with giving up familiar tools.andP;  And professionalengineers must still put their stamp on paper drawings to legally validatethem.andM;The 2-D drawings are made from 3-D models, not the other way around, asbefore.andP;  &quot;2-D drawings are useful for archiving, and they are easy to haularound construction sites,&quot; says Reinschmidt.andP;  &quot;But they are no longer thebasis for design work.&quot;andM;CADAM's CAD program is used for high-speed 2-D drafting, in conjunction withVersatec Inc.'s electrostatic plotters and ink-jet plotters from CalComp Inc.andO;CADAM also has 3-D capabilities.andM;Hook up a relational databaseandM;The database management system is another key building block in Sandamp;W'sintegration plans.andP;  Sandamp;W needed a database that could function as a common,primary source of information for all users.andP;  And the database had to beeasily modifiable or expandable to accommodate continual updates ininformation and changes in data requirements that occur throughout a project.andM;These criteria led the company toward RDBMSes.Flexibility is the major appealof RDBMSes.andP;  Relational technology uses tabular data structures, organized inrows and columns, that are independent of application programs.andP;  Soapplications don't have to be rewritten as the database changes.andM;Sandamp;W's choice was Database 2 (DB2), an RDBMS from IBM that uses structuredquery language (SQL) as a consistent way to query and maintain the database.andO;And Sandamp;W currently runs DB2 on IBM's 3090-180E mainframe, located in thecompany's Boston headquarters.andM;The next step was to link CAD and RDBMS products together.andP;  Data generated bytraditional CAD programs cannot be easily integrated with project informationsuch as facility management and maintenance, production scheduling andinventory control.andM;CATIA makes such integration possible with its Interactive User Access (IUA)feature.andP;  &quot;IUA allows you to execute a program in SQL so information can moveback and forth between a database and the CAD system,&quot; explains Reinschmidt.andO;&quot;We wrote an interface program, called STONElink, that uses this capability.andO;Consequently, both geometric &quot;non-geometric data can be tied to the samedatabase.&quot;andM;Data within Sandamp;W's version of DB2 is organized by construction components,which can be any objects defined by users (e.g.andP;  columns, pipes, motors,ducts.) DB2 can extract geometric information associated with components inthe 3-D programs, such as physical location of the component in the facility,component length and the name of the CAD model incorporating the component.andO;And DB2 contains non-graphical data associated with components includingpurchase order numbers, the dates components are scheduled to appear at thesites and maintenance data.andM;A person can now use SQL, rather than CAD-specific languages, to requestinformation about project components from workstations and STONEview computers linked with DB2.andP;  The system will provide both alphanumericinformation and a visual depiction of the component on the screen, obtainedfrom CATIA.andM;Users can select menu categories such as &quot;bill of materials&quot; or &quot;maintenance&quot;from a 3-D program.andP;  Users then can place a cursor over any point on thescreen and call up the requested data, without having to remember or look upthe component's identification number.andM;The same integrated database provides information needed for engineeringanalysis programs.andP;  Such applications include Structural Design Language(STRUDL)-a structural analysis program from the Georgia Institute ofTechnology-and Quadrex Corp.'s NUPIPE, used for pipe stress analysis.andM;Tie in an expert systemandM;&quot;Being able to obtain geometric data and non-geometric attributes ofcomponents from the same database was a big step,&quot; says Reinschmidt.andP;  &quot;But itwas not quite enough.andP;  We had made CAD pictures intelligent by tying them toa database.andP;  Now we wanted to make them smart by tying them to a knowledgebase.&quot;andM;Sandamp;W built such a knowledge base around the Aion Develop (ADS) expert-systemshell from Aion Corp. It contains rules that support the project staff incarrying out design and construction tasks.andP;  These rules are based oncommon-sense engineering, expert advice, standards, procedures and codespecifications.andP;  Expert-system assistance is available for applications thatinclude production scheduling, real-time process monitoring, weld-defectdiagnosis and technical-specifications compliance monitoring.andM;Rules are typically phrased in an &quot;if ...andP;  then&quot; format.andP;  One set of rulesmight specify  that if a project component weighs a particular amount, then acertain size crane must be employed to lift it.andM;Other rules cover such concerns as the best types of valves to use inparticular piping systems, the proper design of steel connections and thekinds of building methods that will ease maintenance operations.andM;Aion's product can communicate with DB2 but not with the 3-D programs.andP;  Underanother Sandamp;W interface package, called STONErule, graphics information fromCATIA and CADAM can be used directly with the expert system.andP;  When acomponent is selected, STONErule transfers the relevant data to ADS forquestion-and-answer sessions.andP;  The results of ADS can be fed into CAD models.andM;The Construction Management Display System (COMANDS) is a major applicationof Sandamp;W's system.andP;  It combines the visual capabilities of 3-D models with thecost and schedule information available in DB2.andM;&quot;COMANDS helps us determine the constructibility of a design,&quot; says RonZabilski, Sandamp;W's chief construction engineer.andP;  &quot;We can use this package forsuch functions as: analyzing construction sequencing; estimating materialquantities, manpower and labor costs required to implement the project;generating construction schedules; reporting on construction progress.&quot;andM;Zabilski says, &quot;All this gets construction people involved with computergraphics in ways that weren't possible before.&quot;andM;In construction sequencing, for example, engineers calculate the correctnumber of workers, pieces of equipment and quantities of materials that mustappear at the site and in what time frame for the facility to meetconstruction deadlines.andM;Sequencing traditionally is carried out with the aid of plastic modelsdeveloped from 2-D drawings.andP;  The model is usually photographed as it isbuilt to give managers an idea of each construction stage.andP;  This takes timeand adds to project expense.andP;  Disassembling and reassembling models toillustrate alternative construction methods is also difficult.andM;Sandamp;W's Zabilski notes that manually building construction sequences can leadto errors because of mistaken calculations, omitted sequences and problems invisualizing steps from 2-D drawings or plastic model photographs.andM;&quot;We now start with the completed 3-D graphics model of a project and take itapart like an erector set,&quot; says Zabilski.andP;  &quot;In effect, we simulate theconstruction process in the computer.&quot; This results in a graphicallyillustrated sequence of construction steps, or work packages.andP;  Everycomponent is identified with the appropriate work package.andM;Zabilski continues: &quot;There are certain common-sense rules involved in puttingtogether a structure, like starting with the basement.andP;  But otherwise, theconstruction sequence is not inherent in the original design.andM;With a 3-D model, you can illustrate different component assembly sequences,rotate and twist components to view them from any angle and play back anyconstruction process to see if your logic is correct.andP;  Construction plans canalso be observed by site supervision personnel, craft foremen and owners.&quot;andM;It's also easy to adjust construction sequences on the screen in the event ofunanticipated problems, such as late equipment delivery or unavailable workcrews.andM;Because construction managers are more familiar with 3-D graphics tools, theyplay an earlier role in the design process, according to Zabilski.andO;Construction personnel in the past had to wait until designers were finishedbefore they could look at something.andM;&quot;A construction planner can now pull up a 3-D model while it is still beingdesigned and indicate any construction problems the design could trigger,&quot;Zabilski says.andP;  &quot;It's easier to make changes if everyone works with the samemodel up front.&quot;andM;COMANDS also helps calculate how much material and labor is needed,overcoming any number of problems of manual take-off.andM;It works this way: Each component in the construction sequence is assigned an&quot;activity descriptor,&quot; such as &quot;install concrete.&quot;andM;Next: Calculations such as true areas and volumes are obtained from Sandamp;W's 3-Dprograms.andP;  When these calculations are made in conjunction with the activitydescriptor of a component, you know such things as how many cubic yards ofconcrete or tons of reinforcing steel each work package requires.andM;In the database, each type of material is associated with the time needed tocarry out specific tasks on each unit of that material.andM;Now, multiply these labor rates by material quantities.andP;  You now know thetime required to perform each job in each work package and the number ofworkers needed to accomplish a given task in a specific time period.andP;  Suchdata helps construction planners formulate project schedules, which arestored in the database.andM;It's also easy to compare progress at the construction site against plannedsequences maintained in the database, thanks to automatic reports generatedby the system.andP;  A construction supervisor previously had to calculate thequantity of materials installed-a time consuming process.andM;&quot;A person at the work site can now point to the workstation screen housed ina trailer to indicate what portion of the job has been completed,&quot; says DanNevins, senior project controls engineer at Sandamp;W.andP;  &quot;That information istransmitted over phone lines to the mainframe in Boston, where we can see ifestimates of scheduled installed materials are accurate.andP;  The database knowswhat should have been done, when and at what cost.&quot;andM;Checks on estimated labor costs are also carried out via information from thepayroll system to the database.andP;  &quot;We want to determine if the money spent iswhat we had planned,&quot; says Nevins.andP;  &quot;When every update cycle finishes, we canthen measure if we are ahead or behind schedule and over or under budget.&quot;andM;Stone andamp; WebsterandM;* Employees: 10,000 (parent company)andM;* Revenues: $287 million (parent company)andM;Stone andamp;
