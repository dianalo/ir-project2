The 69-year-old evangelist, who has taken his religious messageto more than 60 countries, made today's comments to foreignreporters in Beijing.   Graham, who has preached while in China and held talks withleaders, praised the country's leadership for recognizingshortcomings in defending the rights of believers and acknowledgingthat religion can play a role in the moral development of thenation.   During the first three decades of communist rule in China,places of worship were destroyed and believers persecuted. Religionsuffered especially during the 1966-76 ultra-leftist CulturalRevolution.   The government now guarantees religious freedom, but it allowsonly state-sanctioned religious groups and forbids prosyletizing.   Chinese religious officials say there are about 4 millionmembers of the state-approved Protestant church and more than 3million Catholics affiliated with the Patriotic Catholic Church.Thousands of unaffiliated believers are also thought to worship athome.   Graham, who on Sunday preached to more than 1,500 worshipers ina Beijing Protestant church, said he felt there was ``a possibilityof a very positive turn of events for believers in this country.''   ``I seem to sense here that there is a desire on the part ofleaders for a moral and spiritual rebirth or rejuvenation,something to give purpose and meaning to China today.''   During his week in Beijing, Graham has met religious leaders,scholars, students and government officials, including Premier LiPeng.   Graham confirmed an official Chinese report that quoted Li assaying that China needs spiritual as well as material developmentto prosper.   Graham declined to say whether he discussed with officials theissue of Christians and other believers who have been imprisonedfor their religious activities. Catholics in particular have beenjailed for defying the government policy of cutting all ties to theVatican.   However, Graham said he was told religious leaders are holdingdiscussions on drafting a law on religion and the state. ``Thiswould help diminish both official and popular attitudes ofintolerance and discrimination,'' Graham said.   He was to leave Beijing today for coastal Jiangsu province tovisit the village where his wife Ruth, the daughter ofmissionaries, was born and spent her youth.   Graham was also scheduled to speak at a Christian seminary inNanking and preach at a church in Shanghai. He will visit Cantonbefore leaving China on April 28.</TEXT></DOC>
