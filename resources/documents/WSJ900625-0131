During thoseyears, the great-nephew of Bismarck's field marshall workedin Berlin at the foreign division of the Abwehr (the Germanintelligence service) as a legal adviser to the High Commandof the Armed Services.</LP><TEXT>   His wife, Freya, meanwhile was raising their two smallsons and looking after the family estate at Kreisau inSilesia. They exchanged letters almost daily, and she pliedhim with poppyseed cake and farm-fresh fruit, vegetables andfowl.   During the 1930s Moltke raised a Cassandra's voice toprevent war, haranguing politicians, journalists and clericsin Britain and elsewhere on the futility of appeasement.Then, in the early war years, having just breezed through hisEnglish bar exams, he applied his professional capacities athome, trying to prevent German violations of internationallaw and to protect neutrals. Persistence and pragmatism,Moltke found, won out over ethical reasoning. &quot;What isinternational law is good for the conduct of war,&quot; he wouldargue. In one instance, he argued against Field MarshallKeitel's order to shackle prisoners of war, until Hitlerrelented.   Early on he knew instinctively that Germany hadnext-to-nil prospects of winning the war and thus viewed itas perversely barbaric. &quot;Germans seem to have a pronouncedgift for tactics, and seem to be hopeless at strategy,&quot; hewrote in April 1940. Hitler's generals refused to acknowledgeAnglo-Saxon naval supremacy and Soviet &quot;invincibility,&quot;according to Moltke, and &quot;what the Russians lacked in willour measures have instilled in them.&quot;   Moltke foresaw a &quot;blood-guilt that cannot be atoned for inour lifetime,&quot; yet even he had difficulty believing theunimaginable as it unfolded: the startup of S.S. furnaces inwhich &quot;6,000 people a day are `processed.' &quot; When he saw areport blaming the Russians for using dumdum bullets thatastonishingly was &quot;supported by evidence of the medicalofficer, one Panning, who used the ammunition in alarge-scale experimental execution of Jews,&quot; he wanted only&quot;to see Herr Panning before a court of law.&quot;   Moltke became a central figure in the secret working groupthat came to be known as the Kreisau Circle. It hoped, as Ms.von Oppen states in the introduction, to restore after thewar &quot;the sense of humanity to people who had experienced itsdestruction.&quot; The group, which included Social Democrats,trade unionists and churchmen, dealt with politicalstructure, education, church-state relations, the punishmentof war criminals and the Europeanization of a federalGermany.   Moltke opposed schemes for a &quot;coup d'etat&quot;, Ms. von Oppenwrites, for fear of &quot;a new legend of stab-in-the-back, likethe one that had done so much political harm in Germany after1918.&quot; The revenge that followed the assassination attemptagainst Hitler on July 1, 1944, cost the lives of many withinand outside the Kreisau Circle.   Insights on the war aside, what makes the collectionparticularly enriching is the portrait that emerges of aspecial man during special circumstances: an aristocrat ofextraordinary depth of intellect and sentiment who served hisfamily, nation and God as an incorruptible humanist.   The letters are a constant reflection of their author'sframe of mind. Seeking comfort in Kant, Spinoza and Mozartwhile yearning to be home in Kreisau, he resisted any impulseto lapse into callousness. &quot;I'm always catching myself atit,&quot; he wrote. Having to return the obligatory raised-handsalutes repulsed him as much as the coarse behavior of someof his countrymen he encountered in his travels.   As the war soured, Moltke sensed danger. Codes began todisplace names in the letters. &quot;What a year lies before us,&quot;the first letter in 1944 opened. &quot;If we survive it all otheryears will pale beside it.&quot; Before the month was out he wasarrested. His letters later that year from Tegel prison --written in handcuffs and smuggled out by a chaplain, HaraldPoelchau -- revealed a man preparing for death. &quot;Now Idefinitely don't want to die, there's no doubt about that,&quot;he wrote. Yet he accepted his fate in the knowledge &quot;of beingkilled for something which (a) we really have done and which(b) is worthwhile. . . . we are to be hanged because wethought together.&quot;   On Jan. 11, 1945, 12 days before his execution, Moltketook his leave from Freya: &quot;Only together do we constitute ahuman being,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Therefore, my love, I am certainthat you will not lose me on this earth, not for a moment.&quot;   ---   Mr. Keresztes is deputy editorial page editor of The WallStreet Journal Europe.</TEXT></DOC>
