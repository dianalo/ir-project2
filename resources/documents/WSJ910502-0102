At least, that's what top managers atthe Big Three U.S. auto makers are betting.   General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp.had a combined operating loss of $2.33 billion in this year'sfirst quarter, breaking the record of $2.1 billion set in thefourth quarter last year. But this seeming catastrophe couldbe what's needed to convince these companies to gulp someharsh medicine.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;What these companies need to reform themselves is amoment of truth which causes people to rethink the way theydo business,&quot; says James Womack, co-author of &quot;The MachineThat Changed the World,&quot; a study of Japanese &quot;lean&quot;car-building methods.   Other companies have capitalized on crisis. Lockheed Corp.needed a federal bailout in 1971. But the aerospace giantrebounded, and led a team that last month won the contract tobuild the Air Force's Advanced Tactical Fighter. Xerox Corp.,its copier business battered by cheaper Japanese machines,rallied with new products and now is profitably regainingmarket share.   Big Three executives say they are determined to dolikewise.   At Ford, executives are studying Xerox to learn how thecompany marries quality and customer service. Ford also sentan executive team to watch workers at McDonald's fliphamburgers and cycle customers past drive-up service windows.   Chrysler is tearing down its balkanized managementstructure and reshaping product development.   GM is emphasizing moves to substitute common sense forcapital. &quot;We can't sit and wait for things to turn up,&quot; saysGM President Lloyd E. Reuss.   Detroit has vowed to shape up before, only to ease up whentimes got good. But Big Three executives insist they areready now to make fundamental changes. Here is a closer lookat each company:                                                                                                          GENERAL MOTORS                                                                                                          At GM, even the campaign to cut costs throughsimplification is complicated. Called a &quot;framework forgreatness,&quot; it is shown in company documents as a pyramidmade up of 26 blocks. The blocks represent cost-cuttingstrategies, each with a 100-word definition.   It boils down to stuff like this: Reduce the number ofdifferent car batteries to five from 12, cut the number ofignitions to three from 17 and use three air-conditionercompressors instead of five.   Sounds easy, but not at GM. Just to design the systemsthat control a GM car's engine requires coordination amongsix separately managed GM divisions.   But in October, as sales and production plunged, Mr. Reussgathered 100 senior executives to kick the streamliningefforts into high gear.   Some of the results are striking. Designers cut the numberof parts in a pickup truck by 46%. Engineers reduced thenumber of parts in the bumper of the restyled 1991 Buick ParkAvenue to 44 from 108 in the 1990 model. That cut the timeneeded to assemble the bumper to five from 10 minutes, saysFrank Colvin, who oversees the car's exterior design.   GM also is stepping up the exploitation of its tie toToyota Motor Corp. GM and Toyota's New United MotorManufacturing Inc. plant in Fremont, Calif., is more than sixyears old. But not until last year did GM executives beginmaking extended visits to learn how the Toyota-managedfactory achieves its high quality and productivity. Now,hundreds of GM managers are trekking West for three to fivedays at a stretch.   Matching Toyota efficiency will be painful. Nummi operateswith 3,100 employees, compared with 5,000 at some GMfactories. But Mr. Reuss takes an optimistic view: &quot;We'lllook back in two years and say we did a lot of things wedidn't think we could do.&quot;                                                                                                          FORD                                                                                                          After shedding 14 plants in the early 1980s, Fordexecutives figured they had done enough to handle any slump.But Ford concedes it will struggle to make money this year. Abig reason: The cutbacks that hit Ford's factories never madeit to the offices and labs. Ford now spends 40% more todevelop a new vehicle than it did three years ago.   So executives in Ford's North American business arescrambling to restore discipline with a &quot;strategicimperatives&quot; plan. A new team is trying to finish the nextMustang in three years, about as long as Japanese auto makerstake.   To do the job, Ford ordered Mustang team members to leavetheir offices in different departments and move into the samebuilding. &quot;You get everybody working next to each other wherethey can talk things over right away,&quot; says Alexander J.Trotman, executive vice president for North Americanautomotive operations. &quot;It's how Henry Ford did it when hestarted the company.&quot;   Over the next three years, Ford expects to lop NorthAmerican salary costs by 20% and shorten vehicle-developmenttimes by a year. Ford also wants to cut every dollar nowspent to 80 cents without cutting new products or equipment.   Ford product planners are spending late nights staring ata 30-foot-long chart showing the product-development process.The goal: Find where the process can be compressed and moneysaved.   The visit to McDonald's is part of Ford's attempts todetermine how companies keep customers happy. Only 79% ofFord's buyers say they are satisfied with their car or truckafter three months; Ford wants to raise this to 90%.                                                                                                          CHRYSLER                                                                                                          Chrysler is waiting for the cavalry to arrive, in the formof its first really new vehicles in nearly a decade. One is anew four-door Jeep, code-named ZJ, set to appear next spring.The others are midsize cars code-named LH due next fall.   They can't come too soon. Chrysler has slashed $3 billionout of costs and plans to sell some major assets. The movesensure the company can survive this year, Vice ChairmanRobert S. Miller Jr. recently told some Chrysler dealers. Buthe added that if the sales slump continues into next year,all bets are off.   Meanwhile, Chrysler is pushing its new team system.Chrysler got a late start developing the LH cars, but now ithas cut nearly two years off previous design schedules.&quot;Under the old, gigantic 6,000-person bureaucracy, we hadconstant fights setting priorities and it was hard to do evenone new-product program a year,&quot; says Chrysler PresidentRobert A. Lutz. &quot;Now by pushing more authority downhill we'refinding we get better decisions and we get them faster.&quot;   The LH team, for example, wanted a better suspension forthe cars. Previously that would have required topmanagement's approval. With the new structure, LH teammembers financed the change by putting less chrome on thecars.   Mr. Lutz concedes that when Chrysler began reshaping theway it develops vehicles, &quot;it took a while to prevent amutiny within the engineering organization.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
