The Highway Loss Data Institute study released Tuesday said thevehicles with the best results in both injury and damage claims werethe Pontiac Safari station wagon, the Plymouth Grand Voyager, theDodge Grand Caravan, the Mercury Grand Marquis station wagon and theFord Crown Victoria station wagon,   Vehicles with the worst records had more than double the lossesof those with the best records, with damage results varying morethan injury results.   Cars with the worst claim records in both categories were theIsuzu I-Mark two-door, Ford Escort two-door and EXP and threeMitsubishi models: Cordia, Mirage and Tredia, the institute said.   ``Large domestic cars typically have good results for both injuryand vehicle damage. Small cars have poor results for injury anddamage,'' said Brian O'Neill, president of the institute, notingthat European models tend to have low injury results but high damage.   The study measured how likely a particular car model is to beinvolved in an injury accident and how costly damage to the vehicleis when compared with the average likelihood of injury or damage forall cars on the road.   The results are adjusted for the number of cars of each model onthe road, for possible distortion due to driver age and forvariations in the deductible amount on insurance policies, theinstitute said.   No actual damage or injury claims figures are provided.   O'Neill said the report covered 1986, 1987 and 1988 models, butprovides consumers with a guide to the loss potential of 1989 and1990 model cars with no significant design changes because resultshave proved to be consistent from one model year to another.   The institute is a non-profit, public service organization fundedby the insurance industry and closely associated with the InsuranceInstitute for Highway Safety.   The Mercedes-Benz SDL-SEL, for the second consecutive year, hadthe best injury loss record, followed by the Saab 9000. Both cars,however, showed much higher than average collision damage losses.   Other cars with the best injury records included the Mercedes560SL, Pontiac Safari Wagon, the Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser, theJaguar XJ6, the BMW 500 series, the Mercedes 260E-300D-E, thePlymouth Grand Voyager, and the Dodge Grand Caravan. All had recordsat least 43 percent below the average.   Cars with the worst injury records were the Hyundai Excelfour-door, the Isuzu I-Mark two-door, the Chevrolet Sprint two-door,the Chevrolet Spectrum four-door and two-door, the Ford Escorttwo-door, the Mitsubishi Cordia and Mirage, the Yugo and the HyundaiExcel.   Vehicles with the best damage cost averages were the GMC SafariVan and the nearly identical Chevrolet Astro Van, the Dodge Caravanand Grand Caravan and the similar Plymouth Voyager and GrandVoyager, the Pontiac Safari Wagon, the Mercury Grand Marquis and theChevrolet Caprice.   Cars with the worst vehicle damage results included theVolkswagen Scirocco, the Plymouth Conquest, the Porshe 944 Coupe,the BMW 300 Series two-door, the Mitsubishi Cordia, the ChevroletCorvette, the Toyota Supra, the Nissan 300ZX, the Saab 900, theMazda RX-7 and MX-6.   O'Neill said the study is based on examination of insurancecoverage and claim data involving millions of vehicles.</TEXT><TEXT>   Eds: Copies of the report are available by writing HLDI Car List,P.O.
