Gorbachev today promised a new era ofpeace in the Far East, said the Red Army would reduce its forces inthe area and urged Washington to pull its soldiers out of SouthKorea.   As the Soviet president spoke, a mighty flood of more than 1million Chinese poured into the streets to demonstrate fordemocratic reforms in China and took control of the center ofBeijing.   In his speech to Chinese academics in the Great Hall of thePeople, Gorbachev said the 4,300-mile-long Soviet-Chinese frontiershould be turned into a ``border of peace.''   Gorbachev's historic visit to Beijing is to normalize relationsafter a 30-year chill between the two largest communist countries.   At the news conference later, Gorbachev defended socialistcountries experiencing unrest as they try to reform their systems.   ``If anyone thinks this will lead us to the ash heap of history,I think they will be disappointed again,'' Gorbachev said.   The news conference was delayed because it was moved to anotherlocation to avoid the hundreds of thousands of marching protesters.   ``I would not try to assume the role of a judge,'' Gorbachevsaid when asked about the student unrest.   But he stressed that such problems ``reaffirm the fact thatchanges under way are of a profound nature.   ``Some regard this as a crisis of socialism,'' he said.Problems, he said, ``may bring some pain. But we will stay thecourse'' of democratic reforms.   He made a point of acknowledging receipt of a letter from thestudents who led the demonstrations, saying it was ``a very warmletter, full of feelings of support for perestroika,'' Gorbachev'sreform program.   During a trip outside the city to visit the Great Wall,Gorbachev's motorcade passed waves of demonstrators making theirway in trucks, buses, by bicycle and on foot toward downtown.   Within hours, central Beijing streets were crammed withstudents, workers, teachers and journalists swelling out of centralTiananmen Square into the streets to march for democracy.   Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, canceled plans to tour theForbidden City because of the large crowds.   The Soviet leader said at the news conference today that he``got a little emotional'' from the warmth of young people he metduring a visit to the Great Wall today. ``But I'm human.'' He addedthat ``I feel those three decades were as if they never were.''   In his speech a day after the first Sino-Soviet summit since1959, Gorbachev called for a regional security network in Asia thatwould provide a means of settling disputes.   And he said an earlier pledge to withdraw 200,000 troops fromAsia would be fulfilled by the end of 1990 and would include thepullout of 12 divisions, or 120,000 soldiers, from the Chinafrontier.   The Soviet Union is believed to have 600,000 troops along theChinese border. The Chinese, armed with older equipment, have morethan 1 million troops stationed there.   Gorbachev said 11 air force regiments would be disbanded and 16warships removed from the Pacific Fleet.   Gorbachev added that the Soviet Union is ``prepared to work forthe withdrawal, on terms to be agreed with China, of military unitsand armaments from the border areas, leaving only the personnelrequired for performing routine border guard duties.''   ``Demilitarizing the Soviet-Chinese border and turning it into aborder of peace and good-neighborliness is a noble goal that wecould attain through joint efforts,'' he said.   On Tuesday, in a meeting with Premier Li Peng, Gorbachev said``we want the Soviet-Chinese border to be protected only byfriendship.'' He also called for regular consultations between themilitaries of the two countries.   The two sides fought a brief border war over the disputedfrontier in 1969, and sporadic clashes have continued for years.   On Monday, the day Gorbachev arrived in Beijing, Moscow beganpulling troops out of Mongolia, the Soviet ally along China'snorthern border. The Kremlin has said it will withdraw 50,000troops, three-fourths of the Soviet force in Mongolia, by the endof 1990.   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping, who heads China's military, alsohas reduced the People's Liberation Army from more than 4 millionin 1985 to about 3 million today. Most of those troops arestationed along the Soviet border and China's volatile border withVietnam.   China and other Asian nations have been cool to Gorbachev'sconcept of collective security in Asia, expressing fear it is aSoviet attempt to increase its strategic influence in the area.   On Tuesday, the two sides announced the normalization ofgovernment and party relations, ending a 30-year rift caused byideological and strategic differences and disputes over Sovietactions in Afghanistan and Cambodia.   The summit brought the leaders of the Soviet Union and Chinatogether for the first time since a frosty encounter between NikitaS. Khrushchev and Mao Tse-Tung in 1959.</TEXT></DOC>
