The Fed survey, which covered December and the first twoweeks of the new year, found that -- except for export goods-- orders and backlogs in the industrial sector generallysoftened. Bankers across the U.S. said that lower mortgagerates have spurred refinancing and the sale of inexpensivehomes. But in general, the report said, &quot;consumer andbusiness loan demand has not revived.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   In the retail sector, the new Fed survey confirmed whatsales figures and merchants already have suggested: holidaysales were flat or modestly higher than a year ago, beforeadjusting for price changes.   But despite the softness, banking and business leadersanticipate &quot;economic conditions will improve by midyear,&quot; thesurvey said.   Fed officials are expecting just that. Fed Gov. JohnLaWare, speaking in Albany, N.Y., declared, &quot;We're in agenuine recovery.&quot; But he added, &quot;unfortunately, it's veryslow.&quot; He predicted the economy will be growing again by thesecond quarter.   And Gerald Corrigan, president of the New York FederalReserve Bank, told an audience that a falling inflation rateand corporate restructuring are creating the &quot;potential for astrong economic recovery . . . which may surprise us all.&quot;   The following is a look at conditions in each of the 12Fed districts:                                                                                                          Boston district. Economic weakness still prevails in NewEngland. Retailers said consumers were &quot;particularlyrestrained&quot; in the first half of the Christmas season, but a&quot;last-minute rush&quot; prevented major sales erosion from a yearearlier. Manufacturers said that weakness reappearedthroughout the smokestack economy in the fourth quarter andthat new orders and backlogs were below late-1990 levels.Realtors in New England have different stories to tell: somesay sales are healthy; some say they are weak. A regionalforecasting group sees a &quot;delayed recovery&quot; in the district.

Philadelphia district. Economic activity was &quot;steady&quot; atthe close of 1991. However, retailers said Christmas saleswere below expectations despite massive price cutting.

Atlanta district. Manufacturers say business has remainedslow, although heads of printing and packaging industriesreport small increases in orders and production.
