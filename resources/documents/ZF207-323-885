CummingsandM;Among full-blown database-management systems for the personal computer, atleast four have incorporated query by example (QBE) or similar features forextracting data from relational database files.andM;In addition, two products designed primarily for ad hoc queries of existingdatabase files provide QBE-like features.andP;  Industry observers expect thenumber of systems offering QBE features to increase.andP;  Products are listedbelow, along with comments from current users.andM;dBASE IVandM;Ashton-TateandM;Despite growing challenges from a variety of competitors, Ashton-Tate's dBASEdatabase-management system (DBMS) continues to lead the market for PCdatabase software.andM;A QBE facility is among many new features included in dBASE IV, the latestincarnation.andM;As in other QBE implementations, dBASE IV presents users with screen tablesto be checked off or filled in to indicate the data the user wishes toextract.andP;  Behind the scenes, these query requests are translated into theequivalent statements in the dBASE programming language, which are thenexecuted by the core dBASE database-management software.andP;  Once data has beenretrieved by the query, the user can switch directly from the QBE mode toscreens that permit viewing or editing of the data.andM;Other new features in dBase IV include improved data entry and formattingcompatibilities; a built-in pseudocode-compiler that provides partial supportfor Structured Query Language (SQL); and improved network support.andP;  A newoverall menu-driven interface called the Control Center is now available forusers who found dBase's traditional ''dot prompt'' interface too bleak.andM;The standard edition of dBASE IV sells for $795 and is available fromAshton-Tate at 20101 Hamilton Ave., Torrance, Calif.andP;  90502 (213) 329-8000.andM;According to users .andP;  .  .andM;Users say dBASE IV's QBE facility accomplishes its fundamental mission:making short work of complex database queries.andM;''We use the QBE feature all the time, and we find it makes getting theinformation from our files much easier, especially for our end users,'' saidSteven Saks, director of information systems at the California TruckingAssociation, an industry advocacy organization in West Sacramento, Calif.andM;In essence, dBase IV's QBE Control Center permits users to '' do dBaseprogramming without programming, '' Saks said.andM;''We work with a high volume of data and database files, and we need torelate these files quite often.andP;  The QBE Control Center relieves ourprogrammers from programming all the menial task-oriented queries our endusers do, and gives them the opportunity to work on what we originally hiredthem to do, which was to utilize the high-level applications end of dBASEIV.''andM;ParadoxandM;Borland International Inc.andM;While QBE facilities are just beginning to appear in most PC databaseproducts, Borland's Paradox DBMS has offered a full-blown version of QBEsince Paradox's debut in 1986.andM;In a Paradox QBE, the user views a set of screen tables representing filesfrom which data will be extracted and places a check-mark character in thefields that the query is to produce.andP;  Criteria such as numerical ranges ofvalues used to decide which records will be included in the query output arealso filled in on the screen tables.andM;User queries conducted with the QBE facility can be recorded and used again.andM;The current version of Paradox, release 3.0, is now available for $725 fromBorland International Inc., 1700 Green Hills Road, Scotts Valley, Calif.andO;95066 (408) 438-8400.andM;According to users .andP;  .  .andM;Price Waterhouse's Chicago office switched from dBASE to Paradox because ofParadox's data structure and its user interface, according to Steve Owens,manager of the management-consulting services group at the Big Eightaccounting firm.andP;  Nevertheless, Owens said, Paradox's QBE facility quicklyproved valuable.andM;''When we switched to Paradox, we didn't appreciate how much power its QBEfacility had,'' he said.andP;  ''You can take beginning users and sit them down,and they can become proficient with very complex condition statements againstfiles in a very short time.''andM;Owens praised Paradox not only for its error-trapping facility, but also forits ease of use.andP;  ''When you make an error in setting up a query, Paradoxtells you the type of error you made, and it shows the event up to that errorvisually.''andM;The only complaint Owens voiced about Paradox was its slow performance on PCsnot equipped with additional RAM.andP;  ''The more memory you give Paradox, thefaster it runs.andP;  With less memory it runs slower,'' he said.andM;R:baseandM;MicrorimandM;The current DOS and OS/2 versions of R:base, Microrim's flagship DBMS,feature a QBE-like facility the company refers to as ''prompt by example.''andM;In the R:base system, users are shown screen columns representing the namesof fields in the files being queried.andP;  Instead of placing query requestsdirectly into the columns, however, the user selects columns via a screenpointer and then receives prompts from the system that guide the selection ofquery criteria.andM;R:base for DOS is priced at $725 for a version that supports as many as threeusers, while R:base for OS/2 sells for $895.andP;  Microrim is located at 3925159th Ave.andP;  N.E., Redmond, Wash.andP;  98052 (206) 885-2000.andM;According to users .andP;  .  .andM;''For ad hoc querying, [R:base's] prompt-by-example method is probably aspowerful as you can get,'' said Greg Dodson, director of personal computersat Continental Airlines' Houston headquarters.andP;  Dodson and his staff useR:base to do all their own custom software development, he said.andM;''I build [the prompt-by-example capability] into the programs I write quiteextensively, to allow the end user to do random querying of the databasewithout having to know the programming syntax,'' Dodson said.andM;''All we have to do is provide the users with a description of the tablewhere the data is located, and they can pick it up from there.''andM;Dodson also praised R:Base's overall ease of use.andP;  ''I brought in files fromthe mainframe effortlessly.andP;  Also, I was able just to get R:base up andrunning very quickly -- I couldn't even begin to do that in dBASE,'' he said.andM;On the other hand, Dodson criticized R:base's file-recovery capabilities asincomplete and said it was limited in its ability to detect program errors.andM;DataEaseandM;DataEase International Inc.andM;DataEase is a menu-driven relational database manager andapplication-development environment.andP;  Version 4.0, released in December,contains a set of simplified QBE-like features in a total of eight predefined''quick-report'' formats.andM;To cull information from a DataEase database, the user displays the desiredquick report format on the screen, selects fields from those displayed andenters data-selection criteria in the appropriate fields.andP;  After the query isexecuted, results are displayed in the chosen format and can be furthermanipulated or printed.andM;Once defined, query sequences can also be translated into DataEase'sprogramming language.andM;The single-user version of DataEase 4.0 lists for $700.andP;  DataEaseInternational Inc. is located at 7 Cambridge Drive, Trumbull, Conn.andP;  06611(800) 423-8202.andM;According to users .andP;  .  .andM;''In its current form, DataEase is probably one of the most complete databasepackages you can buy,'' said William Sappington, data-processing specialistfor Security Pacific Leasing Corp., a San Francisco subsidiary of SecurityPacific Bank, which specializes in leasing large equipment to corporateaccounts.andM;''It's a totally menu-driven system with a complete front end on it for theend user, but it also allows the programmer to create a complete databasesystem for whatever reason he wants,'' he said.andM;Sappington gave the DataEase query system particularly high marks, citing itsfoolproof operations and the step-by-step assistance it provides to users.andM;''As you move through a query, it guides you through the procedures requiredto build the query, and it performs error checking as well.andP;  It's incrediblyeasy to use,'' he said.andM;dQueryandM;QuadBase Systems Inc.andM;Users who need to perform complex queries on existing dBASE files, withoutprogramming, have a possible solution in the QBE facilities of QuadBaseSystem's dQuery.andM;''Essentially, we're an 'at-home' query utility for those who don't want towrite programs,'' explained Fred Luk, president of QuadBase.andM;Unlike most other QBE products, however, dQuery translates user queriesdirectly into standard SQL programming statements, which can be seenimmediately on the screen.andM;In addition to its support for dBASE files, the newest release of dQuery,version 2.1, can read and query Lotus 1-2-3 worksheet files and plain ASCIIfiles as well.andP;  A network version, dQuery/Net, is also available.andM;The single-user version of dQuery costs $150 and is published by QuadBaseSystems Inc., 790 Lucerne Drive, Suite 51, Sunnyvale, Calif.andP;  94086 (408)738-6989.andM;According to users .andP;  .  .andM;''dQuery is a small, clean and simple product for accessing dBASE files,''said Michael Masterson, micro systems specialist at the San Jose, Calif.,andO;offices of Arthur Young andamp; Co., the accounting firm.andP;  ''It may not give youmuch in the way of special fonts for printing, but you can't beat it forgetting a quick, accurate report from your dBASE  files.''andM;Tom Gottheimer, manager of engineering at SBT Corp. in Sausalito, Calif.,andO;shares Masterson's enthusiasm for dQuery, pointing to its combination of QBEease of use and SQL compatibility as a primary advantage.andM;''dQuery is really effective for generating queries to our large data filesfor those who don't have a lot of programming background,'' he said.andO;''What's really nice is that it allows you to define queries using thebuilt-in menu facility and then writes an SQL statement that you can uselater if you want to repeat that query.andM;''In fact,'' Gottheimer continued, ''you can use dQuery to learn SQL, sinceyou can save both your QBE and the SQL statement that goes along with it andcompare the two.andP;  I think it's a good idea to learn SQL even if you don'tfeel like you need it.''andM;Q+EandM;Pioneer SoftwareandM;Although the data-extraction tools found in the Windows-basedrelational-database query product Q+E do not meet the strict definition of aQBE system, they do provide a visually oriented interface for databasequeries that has much in common with conventional QBE.andM;Running under Microsoft's Windows environment, Q+E lets users open multipledBASE files in tables on the screen and define links between files simply byclicking on common fields.andP;  To enter the inclusion criteria used in thequery, however, or to change the number and order of fields displayed in thequery result, the user manipulates a series of dialogue boxes and pull-downmenus, rather than making entries in a sample table as in true QBE systems.andM;Once the query is completed, the extracted data can be readily transferred toother applications such as Microsoft's Excel spreadsheet via the WindowsDynamic Data Exchange format.andM;''The two main thrusts of our product are to provide an easy way to queryyour database and to give the Excel user the ability to access dBASE filesfrom within Windows and put that data in his spreadsheet,'' said GeorgeWoltman, president of Pioneer.andM;Although Excel itself can import dBASE files, such files must be imported intheir entirety and cannot be linked to other dBASE files, Woltman said.andO;''Q+E allows the user to import only the results of the query, and it givesyou the ability to join files before you import them.''andM;Q+E, priced at $119, is published by Pioneer Software.andP;  The firm is locatedat 5540 Centerview Drive, Suite 324, Raleigh, N.C.andP;  27606 (800) 876-3101.andM;According to users .andP;  .  .andM;John Tarbox, a consultant/programmer with the Du Pont Pension Fund, aninvestment branch of E.I.andP;  du Pont de Nemours andamp; Co., of Wilmington, Del., hasadopted Q+E primarily as a way to extract information from dBASE files foruse in Excel.andM;''I do a lot of work under Microsoft Windows.andP;  Q+E does a great job ofgetting data out of dBASE III files and making it available to otherapplications that run under Windows,'' Tarbox said.andM;''We have a production application that runs unattended at night that runsprimarily under Excel.andP;  As part of that application we use Q+E to suck dataout of dBASE files and translate it into Excel -- it performs very well,'' hesaid.andM;Tarbox lauded Q+E's SQL features, noting that they allow Excel to conductautomatic updates by repeating a previous query when necessary.andM;''Once you've run your query, you can copy the procedure and paste it intoExcel as an SQL statement,'' he said.andP;  ''If your data has changed, when youopen Excel, it will automatically get the new data.andP;  Not only is that anextremely powerful feature, but I don't have to learn how to write SQLstatements to do it.''andO;</TEXT></DOC>
