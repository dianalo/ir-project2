In spite of that, year in and year outthey get themselves re-elected. The fault lies not solely inhuge campaign chests or the franking privilege. It lies inthe selfishness of the voter. Voters like me.   In one of my first assignments as a priest I learned thevalue of my congressman. A parishioner had been injured onthe job. His physician told him he could not work. He neededto go on Social Security. Social Security didn't agree. Theywanted him to wait at least a year. I called a friend whoworked for our local congressman. In less than three weeks,my parishioner was on disability. I had discovered amarvelous short-cut through the bureaucracy.</LP><TEXT>   Over the years, it has proven a valuable lesson.Interestingly enough, I can only think of one political issueupon which my congressman and I would agree. But he is therewhen I need him.   A fellow cleric was laid off from his parish. Withinseveral days I had a document in my hands that proved to anunbelieving unemployment bureau that nonprofit employees werecovered by the law.   A young serviceman gets into trouble. Within days of acall from the congressman's office an unforgiving Armydecides that a general discharge is fairer than adishonorable one.   An older parishioner is lost in the maze of the SocialSecurity system. The congressman guides her out.   We don't elect our congressmen because of their politicalideals; we elect them because they assist us in gettingthrough a bureaucratic maze. We never ask who created themaze or perpetuates it. We are only grateful because they areour personal ombudsmen, never realizing how truly expensivethese ombudsmen are.   ---   Father Geromel is an Episcopal priest in Swartz Creek,Mich.</TEXT></DOC>
