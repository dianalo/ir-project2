The dollar, which began the day strong, reached intraday highs of around 1.8190 marks and 127.90 yen in Tokyo as dealers there continued short-covering following last week's steep decline in the currency.    As the U.S. currency strengthened, both Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita and Bank of France Governor Jacques De Larosiere lent support to the rise.    Mr. De Larosiere warned against an excessive dollar decline and called for better coordination of economic policies among major industrial countries. Speaking before a meeting of bankers, he said, &quot;We must continue along the path of orderly management of exchange rate relations, which has demonstrated its worth over the past three years.&quot;    His remarks followed news that Mr. Sumita, at a monthly meeting of cabinet ministers in charge of economic affairs, indicated that central banks of major industrial countries may carry out concerted intervention to support the dollar if the U.S. currency continues to decline sharply against the yen. Mr. Sumita apparently didn't mention any specific level at which intervention might take place.    While the reports sustained the dollar above 1.8100 marks and 127.50 yen in Tokyo, traders in Europe began a stretch of dollar sales that continued well into the New York session. The U.S. currency worked its way down below 1.8100 marks and 127.00 yen, where it remained until late position-squaring brought it back up again.    In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.8110 marks, up from 1.8088 late Monday in New York, and at 127.20 yen, slightly above 127.06 yen.    In Tokyo on Wednesday morning, the dollar opened at 127.15 yen, down from Tuesday's close of 127.70 yen.    The Bank of Canada intervened in the open foreign exchange market on two separate occasions Tuesday to slow the dollar's decline against its Canadian counterpart. The U.S. dollar in late trading stood at 83.25 Canadian cents, off from 83.14 cents in New York late Monday. Traders said the central bank &quot;made no attempt to disguise&quot; its activity.    During the New York session, dealers said the market began to hear rumors of an agreement between U.S. and Japanese finance officials to support the dollar if it began to fall as rapidly as it did last week. The subsequent appearance of newswire reports that appeared to support such rumors forced traders to think twice about pushing the dollar any lower.    One report that caught the market's attention in the afternoon stated that Japanese and U.S. monetary officials have reaffirmed the continued implementation of their coordinated policy to stabilize foreign exchange rates.    The report from Nikkei Telecom quoted &quot;sources close to the international monetary authorities&quot; as saying the concerted action will likely be taken if the yen reaches a level of 125 to the dollar. Officials in Washington declined to confirm the report.    John McCarthy, the chief foreign exchange dealer at Amro Bank in New York, said the report supported recent market rumors that the Group of Seven secretly had agreed at their Berlin meeting in September to allow the dollar to depreciate by about 5% from the prevailing levels at that time. &quot;The dollar was close to 133 yen then, so that would mean they would stabilize it around 126 yen, which is more or less in line with what we heard,&quot; he said.    &quot;The talk from the central bankers shows they want some more stability now, and one would expect them to come into the market to try to slow the dollar's descent,&quot; Mr. McCarthy added.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery edged down 40 cents to $411.80 an ounce in moderate trading. Estimated volume was 3.2 million ounces.    Wednesday is a public holiday in Hong Kong and no gold quote was available. </TEXT></DOC>
