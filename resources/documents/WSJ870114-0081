The move comes less than two weeks after Merrill and International Business Machines Corp. pulled the plug on Imnet, their ill-fated joint venture to provide financial information, first to Merrill Lynch's 10,000 account executives, and then to other markets. That venture proved too costly and too complicated.    Automatic Data, a Roseland, N.J.-based computing-services concern, said it agreed to develop a customized quote-service system for Merrill's brokerage subsidiary. Terms of the agreement weren't disclosed.    As currently planned, Automatic Data will deliver the quote system to the first Merrill Lynch branch in about a year, and complete delivery to all Merrill branches in the U.S. two years after that.    Automatic Data, which has been rapidly expanding its computerized market-information business, last year acquired Bunker Ramo Information Systems Inc. from Allied-Signal Inc. Bunker Ramo has a major chunk of the market for stock-price information and at the time ranked No. 2 behind Quotron Systems Inc.    Development of an Automatic Data system for Merrill Lynch could have an impact on Quotron Systems, with which Merrill Lynch has a contract running through 1989 to provide financial information. &quot;A decision as to what will happen will be made at the appropriate time,&quot; a spokesman for the brokerage house said.    Quotron last year was bought by Citicorp for $680 million. Merrill is currently Quotron's biggest customer, according to a Quotron spokesman. He said, &quot;Our hope would be we will continue to be their supplier.&quot;    The Merrill Lynch spokesman said the company &quot;has been looking and continues to look for highly advanced data gathering information machinery for its 10,000 brokers. We have been talking to ADP for some time. We decided to sign an agreement to develop a customized quote system for Merrill Lynch.&quot;    Automatic Data, which had revenue of $1.2 billion in the fiscal year ended June 30, derives about 25% of its revenue from its financial services group, which includes brokerage services, financial information services, banking and thrift services, and electronic funds services. According to its annual report, Automatic Data has more than 55,000 quotation terminals in use by more than 1,000 clients, and more than 7,000 microcomputer-based workstations with more than 300 customers. </TEXT></DOC>
