The Federal Home Loan Bank Board invited healthy institutions and investors to bid for the targeted thrifts, in a move to stem their growing losses. The Board estimated the initial cost to the thrifts' insurance fund of subsidizing the mergers at $6 billion to $7 billion, plus about $2 billion annually, which approaches the limits of the fund's resources.    But some industry critics have estimated the cost at three times that amount, and have said a taxpayer-financed bailout appears increasingly likely. Theo Pitt Jr., chairman of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, the largest thrift trade group, called the plan's cost &quot;unclear,&quot; and said &quot;broader measures&quot; are needed to revive the depressed economy of the oil-producing region and its thrifts. He wasn't specific, but some industry officials have been talking of a federal corporation to buy and hold foreclosed Texas real estate.    Some thrift executives worry that the Bank Board plan will create problems even if it works, by leaving the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. with a heavy debt burden or with little cash to rescue insolvent thrifts elsewhere.    The FSLIC, declared insolvent last year, was buttressed by new authority to issue $10.8 billion in bonds. The Bank Board says it will obtain a total of more than $20 billion to meet expenses over the next three years, from a variety of sources including the bonds and premiums paid by insured thrifts. Yet it plans to finance most merger costs with interest-bearing notes so that it can leverage its cash to help rescue thrifts outside of Texas. That would leave it carrying interest on both the bonds and the notes.    Estimates of the cost of eliminating thrift insolvencies nationwide run between $20 billion and $50 billion and are growing.    Announcing the Bank Board's plan, Chairman Danny Wall said the mergers would enable Texas thrifts to move toward profitability by cutting overlapping branches and unnecessary personnel. The potential for such efficiencies should help attract new capital from acquirers and investors, he said.    Mr. Wall said potential thrift acquirers within Texas alone have said they are ready to provide more than $1 billion in new capital in the consolidated enterprises. &quot;We expect that figure to grow,&quot; he said.    George Barclay, president of the Dallas Home Loan Bank, said it will try to ensure &quot;that institutions don't come in and cherry-pick,&quot; by taking only the best of the troubled thrifts. Acquirers may be required to take on thrifts they don't want, he said.    Bank Board members expressed the hope that the consolidation will enable Texas thrifts to trim the premium they currently have to offer to attract funds, now at about one percentage point, while also lowering such costs to other thrifts.    Mr. Wall conceded that FSLIC costs could increase if the Texas economy worsens, which he doesn't expect. But he repeated a pledge to share in any profits of FSLIC-aided thrifts, largely through obtaining stock in them.    The list of targeted Texas thrifts includes 104 insolvent institutions and 39 other deeply troubled thrifts.    Bert Ely, a thrift consultant based in Alexandria, Va., contended that the FSLIC would need to spend more than $20 billion to eliminate the negative net worth of all insolvent Texas thrifts. The negative net worth -- assets minus liabilities -- of the 104 insolvent thrifts is estimated at about $7 billion, by generally accepted accounting principles, but Mr. Ely argued that large loan losses remain unrecognized on the books of Texas thrifts. As of September, he noted, 23.7% of Texas thrift mortgage loans were delinquent. </TEXT></DOC>
