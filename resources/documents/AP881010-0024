Also Sunday, underground Palestinian leaders called for worldintervention to stop what they called Israeli repression in theterritories.   Troops shot and killed two Palestinians in the West Bank onSunday during widespread searches for suspected agitators, themilitary reported. In the Gaza Strip, a border security guardkilled a man who attacked him with a knife.   The army said eight other protesters were wounded Sunday, butArab hospital officials put the number at 23. The day's violenceincreased the casualty toll of the last three days to nine dead andmore than 70 wounded.   The uprising has taken the lives of 294 Palestinians since itbegan in December. Six Israelis have also been killed. The revolthas become the leading issue in the campaign for Israeli nationalelections on Nov. 1.   The uprising against Israel's rule of the West Bank and GazaStrip, captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East War,entered its 11th month Sunday. A general strike marking theanniversary closed stores and paralyzed public transportation.   A military spokesman said the army changed tactics by going onthe offensive Sunday and entered West Bank towns and villages tosearch for suspects and arrest them.   ``We took initiated action in over 30 villages with the goal ofacting on days, such as strike days and anniversaries,'' said thespokesman on condition of anonymity.   Soldiers forced residents to whitewash illegal anti-Israelislogans off walls and clear road barriers. Protesters have used thebarriers during their clashes with police.   In the West Bank village of Yatta, a mob attacked troops withrocks, and the soldiers opened fire, the spokesman said.   Two residents were shot, he said. Army helicopters evacuatedthem, but they died while receiving medical treatment.   One was wanted by security forces, the spokesman said, but hewould not give the man's name or what he was suspected of.   In Gaza, a 20-year-old resident was shot and killed by acivilian security guard he tried to knife at a border crossing, amilitary spokesman said. The victim, a university student in Egypt,had just returned to Rafah aboard an Egyptian bus with about 10passengers, and the guard was questioning him, the spokesman said.   Palestinian sources identified the victim as Osama Ahmed AbuDahi, of Rafah.   A second man was wounded, and Arab sources identified him as33-year-old Ibrahim Hamdan Abu Fogo, of Rafah. He was in goodcondition at Beersheba's Soroka Hospital.   Israeli radio said the security guard questioned the man afterrecognizing him as a suspect wanted by security forces foranti-Israeli activity.   ``Our security man did a very good job,'' said Shmuel Shafran,chief manager in charge of the border post at Rafah. ``Even thoughhe was injured, he displayed courage and resourcefulness, overcamethe attacker and killed him.''   The guard and second passenger were only slightly injured, thearmy said. The military put a curfew on Rafah, a town of 11,000, toprevent demonstrations after the killing, the army said.   In an underground leaflet, uprising leaders called on U.N.organizations to act against Israel's closure of schools anduniversities in the occupied territories.   Israeli authorities have kept West Bank schools and most Gazaschools closed this academic year for fear classrooms would be usedas rallying points for riots. The schools were closed most of thelast academic year as well.   The leaflet called on residents of the territories to organizesit-in protests outside foreign embassies and U.N. offices toprotest the closures.</TEXT></DOC>
