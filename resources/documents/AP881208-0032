Now let me do the same with you and consider how we'vedone these last eight years and whether we've done well. And I domean ``we.''   We have come a long way together _ from the intellectualwilderness of the 1960s, through the heated intellectual battles ofthe 1970s, to the intellectual fruition of the 1980s.   The American Enterprise Institute stands at the center of arevolution in ideas of which I, too, have been a part. Our ideaswere greeted with varying degrees of scorn and hostility by what weused to call the ``establishment'' institutions.   The universities, once the only real home for Americanscholarships, have been particularly unresponsive. And so it becamenecessary to create our own research institutions as places wherescholars could congregate and important studies could be producedthat did not kow-tow to the conventional wisdom. And yourinstitution's remarkably distinguished body of work is testimony tothe triumph of the think tank.   For today, the most important American scholarship comes out ofour think tanks, and no think tank has been more influential thanthe American Enterprise Institute. (Applause.)   What we wanted was a chance to try our ideas out on the worldstage. We have. And my friends, I hope you're as proud as I,because, despite the naysayers and the conventional wisdom, thewords of the pundits, and the false prophecies of false Cassandraswho proclaimed we could not succeed, we knew we were right.   And I believe that, yes, we have been vindicated.   And nowhere is that more true than in the realm of foreignpolicy. We came to Washington together in 1981, both asanti-communists and as unapologetic defenders and promoters of astrong and vibrant America. I am proud to say I am still ananti-communist _ (applause). And I continue to be dedicated to theidea that we must trumpet our beliefs and advance our Americanideals to all the peoples of the world until the towers of thetyrants crumble to dust.   Yes, it seems to me that we've been as one these past eight yearsin an effort to establish a foreign policy that stood in firmopposition to the previous decade's misguided attempt to place thiscountry on what they used to call, in the 1970s, the ``right side ofhistory'' _ by which those who used that unpleasant Marxist phrasemeant we should accept the dominion of our adversaries over largeparts of the world.   We said no. We said we must propound and advance our nationalideals abroad and once again hold high the banner for what I will,until the breath is gone from my body, continue to call ``the freeworld.'' (Applause.)   We promulgated a foreign policy whose fundamental basis was thetruths all Americans hold to be self-evident: That all men arecreated equal, that they are endowed by their creator withunalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and thepursuit of happiness.   We have done this, not solely because we believe it is right, butbecause we know it is in our national interest to do so.   A foreign policy based on our bedrock principles allows us tooffer a practical solution to the suffering peoples of the world, ameans of achieving prosperity and political stability that allAmericans take for granted as their birthright.   What we are telling them _ and their ofttimes recalcitrantleaders _ is that they cannot achieve prosperity and stabilitythrough redistribution of resources, or by taking up arms against asea of self-inflicted troubles.   We've seen how that last monstrous idea has worked this decade _the war between Iran and Iraq, whose initial aim was control over anoil-rich province, has done more damage to both countries than 10plagues.
