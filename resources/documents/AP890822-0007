The bright Mediterranean sun glinted from its high-risebuildings and its vaults were full of oil money.   Beirut was a stimulating intellectual center then, and a vitalcontact point for businessmen.   Now, it is a shambles strewn with garbage, a city brought low by14 years of vicious civil war.   Those of us who lived there remember Beirut before the war as aplace where 100,000 foreigners mingled with Middle Eastern princes,high-rollers, emigres, adventurers and 17 Christian and Moslem sects.   A veneer of Western culture was superimposed on the fragilesectarian structure created by the French when they granted Lebanonindependence in 1943. A dormant volcano of hatreds seethed beneaththe exuberance and sophistication.   Luxury hotels, apartments and office blocks gleamed between theblue Mediterranean and pine-covered mountains.   Non-Lebanese Arabs, constrained at home by puritanical Moslemrules or dictators, could kick up their heels with liquor, women or$300 roulette chips and voice their political opinions freely in theArab world's only working democracy.   Westerners came to tap the oil money that poured into Beirut,buying into several dozen Lebanese banks or opening their ownoffices.   Citibank of New York decorated a full floor of its office annexat the Holiday Inn with imported carpets and furniture.   A few months later, we watched from the Associated Press officenearby as it was looted and destroyed by rival militias battling forstrategic high-rise buildings along what became the line dividingChristian and Moslem sectors of the city.   Westerners found Beirut intriguing for its combination of modernamenities with the oriental flavor of the old gold market, itscosmopolitan society, the Middle Eastern food at such restaurantssuch as Ajami's.   I still have a dusty, English-language guidebook, the lastpublished before the war. ``Everywhere you will feel the warmeastern hospitality,'' it says. ``One thing a foreigner in Beirutneed never worry about is making friends.''   Fourteen years later, scores of foreigners have been kidnapped,most of them by virulently anti-Western Moslem groups. Sixteen stillare held, including Terry Anderson, an AP colleague.   More than 150,000 Lebanese, most of them civilians, have beenkilled in the war and 1 million have been displaced.   Burned-out hulks of the St. Georges, Palm Beach, Phoenicia andHoliday Inn hotels cluster in what once was Beirut's tourist centerand now is a wasteland inhabited only by snipers.   I recall sitting in the St. Georges restaurant in the good olddays, watching water skiers skim behind needle-nosed Italianspeedboats.   There also was the less-costly, though fastidious, Myrtoum Houserestaurant and pension run by Hans Matschek, an Austrian expatriate.Regulars said it was the only place in Lebanon's sunny climate torisk eating steak tartare.   An attraction at night was the great Casino de Liban, north ofthe city in what is now Christian territory, where one could gambleor watch two imported floor shows.   Those with the right connections might attend functions dominatedby the doyenne of high society, Isabelle Soursock. She was from anold-money Lebanese Christian family and became Lady Isabelle whenshe married Sir Desmond Hamilton.   A vivid memory is of a visit to the home of Henri Pharaon, abachelor shipping millionaire who lived among priceless Islamic arttreasures and pictures of horses he raced against those of Saudiprinces.   The racetrack on the city's dividing line is a ruin now, anightmare scene of bullet-splintered trees and shell holes.   An unusual establishment, even for Beirut, was the Surprise. Itwas the size of a packing crate and had a bartender, four stools,one hefty prostitute and a remarkable number of customers biddingfor her favors.   The American University of Beirut and large numbers of Arabintellectuals who fled persecution in their own countries gave thecity a more serious side.   ``The Arab emigres contributed to the city more than the Lebanesesocialites,'' said Charles Snow, an oil economist who spent manyyears in Beirut and moved to Cyprus in 1976.   The American University and medical school once had 5,000students and produced a great share of the professional, academicand political leaders in the Arab world.   Among the graduates was Dr. George Habash, whose Popular Frontfor the Liberation of Palestine carried out airline hijackings inthe 1970s.   A 5-month-old artillery war between Syrian and Christian soldiershas forced the university to close temporarily. Several of itsofficials have been kidnapped.   Adjoining the park-like university campus was the AmericanCommunity School, where children of expatriate families studied andplayed Little League baseball. Some tried the pinball machines atAnwar's, where many British and American boys, including my twosons, learned Arabic insults from local youngsters.   Beirutis could ski at Faraya on Mount Lebanon, play tennis orsquash and race in motor rallies.   An American journalist who played at the Golf Club of Lebanon,next to the now-closed airport, as late as 1983 wrote that thesafest places on the course were the sand traps.   The luxurious Delamiyeh Country Club, with a gorgeous sea viewfrom a ridge south of the city, was abandoned after Palestinianguerrillas took it over early in the war.   Will the old Beirut ever return?   No one knows, but I remember Khaled Saab, owner of Summerland, afunctioning hotel built during the war. A television reporter askedwhy he made the investment, and Saab replied:   ``Did you, as a child, ever kick over an anthill? Did you see howquickly the ants rebuilt? That's Lebanon.''</TEXT></DOC>
