The suspects are accused of making $3.4 million in gross profits from a telephone operation that targeted more than 1,000 would-be art investors, including &quot;a disproportionate number of doctors,&quot; U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani said.    High-quality posters of seven of Mr. Dali's works were sold to investors as limited-edition lithographs and etchings authorized and signed by Mr. Dali, according to federal officials.    The investors bought the posters for prices ranging from $1,300 to $6,000 from the former Barclay Gallery in Manhattan, according to federal officials. They said the gallery employed 50 to 60 salespeople between March 1983 and April 1985. Mr. Giuliani said he couldn't comment on what caused the gallery to go out of business.    Indicted were Barclay President Larry D. Evans, 35 years old, of Phoenix, Ariz.; James Burke, 34, of Long Island, identified as the gallery's manager; Prudence Clarke, 64, of New York, identified as the sales staff supervisor; and salesman Jeffrey Kasner, 38, of Scottsdale, Ariz.    It was the first time this decade that federal charges have been brought against purveyors of fake lithographs, officials said. Mr. Dali's works have been favorites of fake-art salesmen and have cost investors more than $1 billion to date, according to U.S. Postal Inspector Jack S. Ellis.    None of the defendants could be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
