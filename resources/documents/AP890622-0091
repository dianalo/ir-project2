(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A sliver of light known as the ``sundagger'' missed its mark on an ancient Indian rock etching on theopening day of summer for perhaps the first time in 1,000 years,scientists say.   A shift in the position of a 9-foot-tall slab of sandstone atopnearby Fajada Butte, probably because of erosion, changed the angleat which the light fell Wednesday.   ``It's very serious and sad,'' said archaeo-astronomer AnaSofaer, who is credited with discovering the ``sun dagger'' 12 yearsago. ``We knew when we first saw the site that it had a fragilitythat was remarkable.''   Researchers believe that the rock drawing, or petroglyph, wascarved between 950 and 1150, at the peak of the Anasazi Indianculture.   It is believed the carving was a kind of calendar, with the rocksarranged to cast distinctive patterns of light and shadow across iton important days of the year. The ``sun dagger'' occurred on thesummer solstice, the first day of summer when the sun is at itshighest point of the year in the Northern hemisphere.   Distinctive patterns of light are also cast at the wintersolstice and the fall and spring equinoxes _ when day and night areof equal length.   ``We're used to this thing acting like a clock,'' physicist RolfSinclair said.   When the solstice arrived Wednesday, the dagger widened,lengthened and missed the circular dawing entirely, appearing aboveand to the left.   Michael Zelik, a physics and astronomy professor at theUniversity of New Mexico, said it's clear the rocks have not movedmuch, if at all, over the years. He said the erosion noticed thisyear may be due to 10 years of wet weather.   Many researchers believe England's ancient rock monument known asStonehenge is also arranged to take advantage of the summer solstice.</TEXT></DOC>
