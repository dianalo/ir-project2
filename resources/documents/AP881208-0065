SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President and Nancy Reagan compared notes at theWhite House after a day of superpower summitry and found they'd bothswapped invitations with their Soviet counterparts to make returnvisits with each other some day.   The president and first lady had come to New York for their finalofficial meetings with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and his wife,Raisa. The foursome had been together at three previous summitsdating back to 1985.   The Reagans plan to retire to their home state of Californiaafter the inauguration of President-elect George Bush in January.They will have a residence in Los Angeles, and plan to retain their688-acre ranch in the Santa Ynez Mountains outside of Santa Barbara.   Prior to Gorbachev's first visit to the United States lastDecember for the Washington summit, Reagan often said he wantedGorbachev to tour the United States. Gorbachev, however, did notouring and spent only a few days in Washington.   At the White House late Wednesday, Mrs. Reagan told the presidentshe'd invited Mrs. Gorbachev to return to the United States, andthat Mrs. Gorbachev had responded in kind. ``The president came homeand said he'd had the same exchange'' with the Soviet president,said Elaine Crispen, press secretary to Mrs. Reagan.   The president and Mrs. Reagan had returned to Washington onseparate planes and discussed the events of the day when they gotback to the executive mansion, Mrs. Crispen said.   The spokeswoman, who flew back to Washington with Mrs. Reagan andBarbara Bush, said she spoke with Mrs. Reagan by telephone aftershe'd returned to the White House.   While Reagan met with Gorbachev on Governors Island in New YorkHarbor, Mrs. Reagan and Mrs. Gorbachev attended an exclusiveluncheon hosted by Marcela Perez de Cuellar, the wife of the U.N.Secretary General.   Mrs. Gorbachev told Mrs. Reagan that ``destiny had brought themtogether'' and that she was certain they'd see each other in thefuture, Mrs. Crispen said the first lady related. Mrs. Gorbachevexpressed the hope that the Reagans would return to the Soviet Unionand see more than they'd been able to during last year's Moscowsummit, Mrs. Crispen said.   Mrs. Reagan responded, ``Yes, she'd like to do that, and addedthat she'd like to have them come to California,'' Mrs. Crispen said.   Both Reagans told the Gorbachevs ``they had always hoped theywould see the West as well as the East, because they are totallydifferent,'' Mrs. Crispen said.   The couples agreed that ``time constraints'' during their pastmeetings had kept them from seeing all the sights that they'dwanted, and that they hoped ``maybe something could be worked out inthe future,'' Mrs. Crispen said.   The spokeswoman said the invitations were not specific and that``they didn't talk about times.''   Mrs. Crispen said Mrs. Reagan and Mrs. Bush celebrated theirjoint return home by having a picture taken, because they haverarely traveled together on official trips.   ``They talked all the way home,'' Mrs. Crispen said, primarilyabout their plans for the holidays.</TEXT></DOC>
