The study, which analyzed the system used by the NationalAeronautics and Space Administration to protect its spacecraft fromlightning and other adverse weather, said that major improvementsare needed in organization and in instruments.   NASA, the panel said, ``has been poorly organized to provideweather support and the result is a system that is less thanstate-of-the-science,'' the report said. It noted that unlessimprovements in the weather forecasting system are made at theKennedy center, ``weather will loom larger as a threat to arejuvenated and accelerated space flight program.''   The study said that NASA must have a system that can accuratelyforecast weather and lightning conditions that are valid for atleast two hours.   ``Observations of lightning, electric fields aloft ... and rapidwind variations are most urgently needed,'' the report said.   John A. Ernst, director of NASA's weather support office, saidthe space agency asked for the study and is now studying theresults.   ``We've taken some initial steps and the recommendations confirmthat the steps we've taken are the right thing to do,'' said Ernst.``We've got a better handle on the problem now.''   The National Research Council recommended these actions:   _Equipping an aircraft with instruments to measure electricfields aloft and to gauge wind velocity and turbulance in the pathof a spacecraft to be launched or landed.   _Installation of an instrument that will detect sudden windchanges.   _Installation of additional instruments to monitor the approachof major thunderstorm systems.   NASA managers were criticized in the study for not defining theprecise minimum weather conditions for a space shuttle launch.   ``The weather support system has not been able to concentratesufficiently on the special problems of the space shuttle,'' thereport said. ``Some critical parameters are currently not measured_ such as drop sizes in clouds and rain, which are hazardousbecause of the possibility of protective tile damage _ and there isno program to initiate these types of measurements,'' the reportsaid.   Ernst said that the agency is planning to put special weatherinstruments aboard an airplane that will cruise near the spacecenter during a space launch countdown. He said the airplane willbe equipped to measure the potential for lightning in clouds up to45,000 feet.   NASA also is installing instruments on a buoy anchored in theAtlantic Ocean east of the launch pad. Ernst said this should givemore information on approaching thunderstorms.   Additionally, he said, the space agency is planning to install aradar which will warn of wind shear turbulence.   NASA requested the NRC study when lightning caused thedestruction of an Atlas-Centaur rocket after it was launched fromthe Kennedy Space Center. Later studies showed the rocket was hitby four strokes of lightning 48 seconds after liftoff. Theelectrical discharge disrupted an on-board computer memory systemand the vehicle went out of control. NASA destroyed the rocket toprotect property and people downrange, using a signal from theground.   At the time of the Atlas-Centaur destruction, the NationalResearch Council panel said, NASA and the Air Weather Service ofthe Air Force were operating one of the largest networks ofelectrical field measurements in the world. Yet, the report said,these measurements had not been entered into the system thatcommitted to launch.   Rockets, as they rise from the launch pad and streak towardspace, are able to trigger lightning if they penetrate clouds thatcontain high charges of electricity. The tail of hot gasesstreaming from the rockets can actually form a conduction path forthe lightning charge to flow to the ground.   Triggered lightning has hit only one piloted U.S. spacecraft.Apollo 12 was struck twice by lightning as it was launched on Nov.14, 1969. The electrical charge temporarily disruptedcommunications and permanently damaged nine non-essential circuits,but the spacecraft and its astronauts successfully completed thesecond manned landing on the moon.   The National Research Council is the principal operating arm ofthe National Academy of Science and the National Academy ofEngineering.</TEXT></DOC>
