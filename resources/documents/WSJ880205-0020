Generous jobless benefits have robbed unemployment of its sting, and politicians and voters of both left and right share a deep aversion to taking any stimulative step that might reignite inflation, however remote the current 1% inflation rate might make that danger seem. Thus, there is no sign the nation will abandon its conservative economic ways for anything that even hints of risk or revolution.    That is good news for those who want West Germany to remain a pillar of political stability in Europe and in the Atlantic alliance. But it is bad news for those allies -- France, Britain and above all the U.S. -- who demand that it prod its economy to promote global growth.    In today's West Germany, unemployment totals somewhere between January's official figure of 2.5 million people, or 9.9% of the work force, and an unofficial 3.5 million. The January rate, reported yesterday, was up from December's 9.2%, though neither figure was seasonally adjusted.    No matter how loudly Washington, London or Paris complain that Germany shirks its international duties, Bonn replies that its jobless level is better than the overall European rate of 11%. And though a few politicians worry about the high cost of unemployment benefits, and about the country's limp growth rate last year of 1.7%, the prevailing attitude is that there's little cause for alarm.    Idled workers are entitled to collect 63% to 68% of their previous take-home pay, and the government picks up the cost of social-security payments and health insurance. Benefits continue for 12 to 32 months, depending on the worker's age.    Some social scientists suggest that a deterioration in West Germans' work ethic lies behind the persistently high unemployment. &quot;Today, the tendency is to blame the system, rather than yourself, for being unemployed,&quot; declares Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann, a sociologist who runs the Allensbach polling institute.    Ms. Noelle-Neumann reports that one Allensbach poll last year found that half the long-term unemployed hadn't even written an application letter in more than a year. And 60% in the poll said they would take a job only &quot;if it were fun.&quot;    Many of the unemployed make no bones about their choosiness. A woman by the name of Annetta, who quit her job as a gardener for the city of Frankfurt more than a year ago because the people at work weren't friendly, says she has passed up several job offers since. &quot;I'll wait till something comes along that I like,&quot; she says.    Annetta can afford to wait. She takes home 1,000 West German marks ($591) each month in unemployment benefits, not too much less than the 1,400 marks she cleared when working. Her local labor office pays health insurance and social-security charges. And she dabbles a bit in the unofficial &quot;black economy,&quot; earning extra, tax-free money by working illegally for landscapers and decorators.    Others echo Annetta's unhurried attitude. A former store clerk named Marcus refuses to leave his town in the industrial Ruhr region to go south, where work is easier to find. &quot;What good would a job do me in a strange place where I don't know anybody?&quot; he asks. And Heinz, an out-of-work teacher in Cologne, says he turned down a job at a penitentiary because it would have been &quot;just too hard.&quot;    The conservative government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl maintains it is dealing with joblessness as best it can. But critics dismiss its efforts as half-hearted and cosmetic. In the absence of loud protests by the unemployed, they say, the government feels free to cater to the conservative instincts of the rest of the population.    &quot;There is a stubborn feeling in Bonn that its highly conservative fiscal policy is the political, social and cultural preference of the majority of West German voters, 90% of which are employed,&quot; observes Anthony M. Solomon, chairman of S.G. Warburg Securities U.S.A. in New York and an authority on international economics.    There are some muted expressions of concern from within the ruling coalition. Mathias Wissmann, economic policy spokesman for Mr. Kohl's Christian Democratic Union Party, decries his compatriots' ever-shortening work weeks and lengthy annual vacations. He advocates more industry deregulation to encourage economic growth. But he grows despondent when he considers &quot;the amazing number of letters I get from my district alone urging against stimulative moves.&quot;    Such public sentiment makes it hard for the government to undertake expansionary policies. &quot;It would take a couple of highly articulate politicians, real leaders who could press home the unpopular view that expansive steps have to be taken,&quot; says S.G. Warburg's Mr. Solomon.    In time, though, he says, &quot;a skillful politician could bring people around. And the time is ripe in Germany.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
