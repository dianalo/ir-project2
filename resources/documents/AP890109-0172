Reagan requested $315.2 billion in budget authority _ a 2 percentincrease after inflation _ for national defense in fiscal 1990beginning next Oct. 1. Over the past four years, Congress hastrimmed defense spending increases to levels below the rate ofinflation.   The defense budget envision that only $303 billion of the $315.2billion will be paid out during the fiscal year. The balancerepresents money that would be authorized for various programs butnot spent until later.   Of the totals, $305.6 billion in budget authority and $293.8billion in outlays is earmarked for the Defense Department. Theremainder _ $9.6 billion in budget authority and $9.2 billion inoutlays _ is contained in the Energy Department's budget to covernuclear warhead production and research work.   Reagan's spending plan also includes recommendations for fiscal1991. He requested $330.8 billion in budget authority then, of which$314.4 billion would actually be spent during the period.   President-election Bush is expected to amend Reagan's proposalafter he assumes office. Bush has talked of cutting the request sothat it just matches inflation instead of providing real growth.   Many of Reagan's priorities, however, are likely to be embracedby Bush. Reagan's budget, for example, increasing funds for militaryrecruiting and by proposes 3.6 percent pay raise for those inuniform, compared with only a 2 percent proposed pay raise forcivilian workers.   The budget plan also requests $500 million to begin shutting downunneeded military bases. It would reduce the Defense Department'scivilian workforce of 1.1 million by 5,000 people and shift morethan two dozen existing weapon programs toward multi-year contracts.   Several of Reagan's defense proposals also are sure to stircontroversy.   For instance, Reagan wants to scrap development of thetruck-mobile, single-warhead Midgetman nuclear missile, a weaponfavored by some Democratic leaders in Congress.   His budget also would earmark $94.6 million to start developmentof a new anti-satellite weapon that could be deployed at sea.Congress forced cancellation of such a weapon that would haveoperated from land-based jets.   And Reagan would significantly boost spending on Star Warsresearch _ from $4.05 billion this year to $5.9 billion in fiscal1990 and $7 billion in 1991.   Bush has said he supports Star Wars research, but it remainsunclear how fast he's willing to pursue it.   Even with the spending increase, outgoing Defense Secretary FrankC. Carlucci said the administration had made some hard choices insetting priorities, either canceling or delaying two dozen programs.   Most of the affected programs were rather small, but one _ aproposal to upgrade the Navy's A-6 Intruder attack jet _ would save$503 million in fiscal 1990.   ``The moderate 2 percent real growth rate proposed in this budgetis an attempt to steer a sustainable and fiscally responsible coursethat allows the United States to maintain its current forcestructure and to acquire the weapon systems necessary to ensure ournational security,'' Carlucci said.   Among the major defense proposals, Reagan urged Congress to:</TEXT><TEXT>   _Move the new B-2 stealth bomber which unveiled just two monthsago into production, along with the Navy's new Trident IIsubmarine-launched nuclear missile and a rail-mobile version of thegiant MX intercontinental ballistic missile. Also on the nuclear, orstrategic forces, side, the fiscal 1990 budget calls for continueddeveloped of the Advanced Cruise Missile and construction of anotherTrident submarine. The Marine Corps would begin production of theV-22 tilt-rotor aircraft.   _Increase active-duty personnel strength slightly by 5,000 infiscal 1990 _ up to 2,138,000 _ then adjust it back down by 4,000 infiscal 1991. The small swing is needed to help the Navy bring somenew ships on line, the Pentagon said. The reserve forces andNational Guard would increase in strength by 7,600 to 1,178,000.   _Allow the Navy to increase in size from 568 battle force shipsto 574 by the end of fiscal 1990. That number would decline slightlyto 571 by the end of 1991 with the retirement of old submarines.However, the fiscal 1990 budget also would allow the Navy to beginconstruction of 19 new ships in addition to the new Trident missilesub.   _Cut from 36 to 35 the number of Tactical Air Wings in the AirForce, but maintain the existing size and structure of the Army andMarine Corps. Readiness training programs would be maintained attheir current level _ Army, Navy and Air Force flying hours permonth and Navy steaming days would not be changed. The Army's tanktraining budget, which allows 850 tank miles per year, would bereduced slightly to 800 miles per year.   _Maintain for the most part existing production rates foraircraft. The Army would build both UH-60 Blackhawk transporthelicopters and AH-64 attack choppers at the current rate of 72 ayear. The Marine Corps would continue to buy 24 AV-8B Harrier jets ayear, and the Air Force would continue to purchase 36 F-15 jetfighters a year. The Air Force's purchases of F-16 fighters woulddecline from 180 this year to 150 in 1990, while the Navy wouldreduce its purchases of F-A-18 fighters from 84 a year to 72 a year.The Navy would increase from 12 to 18 the number of either new ormodernized F-14 fighters it buys annually.   my</TEXT></DOC>
