With AM-China, moving on generalnews wires only.</HEAD><DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Income from tourism in the first half of 1989 wasdown 1 percent from the same period last year, China said Thursday,although it has virtually halted since troops crushed thepro-democracy movement in June.   In the first six months of the year, China earned $970 millionfrom tourism, said He Guangwei, deputy director of the NationalTourism Administration.   The number of tourists dropped 14.3 pthe officia the same periodlast year, to 12.89 million people, the official Xinhua News Agencyquoted He as saying. He did not explain the reason for the decrease.   Tourists stopped coming altogether immediately after the June3-4 crackdown in Beijing in which hundreds, perhaps thousands, ofstudent protesters and their supporters were killed.   The summer months are the height of the tourist season, but onlya few foreigners are visiting China. The United States still isadvising Americans not to make unnecessary trips to China, althoughthe State Department on Wednesday allowed dependents of U.S.diplomats to return.   He predicted that 22 million tourists will visit China in 1989and the industry will earn $1.3 billion. Others, however, are notas optimistic.   ``I don't think this year is going to be a very exciting year asfar as business is concerned,'' said Bernd Riegger, general managerof the Holiday Inn Lido in Beijing.   The Lido and other major hotels in Beijing are reportingoccupancy rates of 45 percent to 50 percent, but many of theirguests are businessmen rather than tourists. The Lido is normally90 percent full at the height of the tourist season, Riegger said.   Beijing's smaller, older hotels, are faring much worse, withonly a handful of rooms seen lighted at night.   The Beijing Tourism Administration has ordered hotels to cutstaff salaries by up to 25 percent to compensate for the loss, andhotel employees said some workers have been laid off.   Taxi drivers complain they must wait hours for a passenger andoften are unable to meet their daily fare quotas.   ``We in the tourism industry are the most directly affected'' bythe crackdown, said one driver, who waited five hours for a fare.   But He predicted ``the industry will soon rise from loss.'' Hesaid China will send delegations to tour fairs in Chicago, Londonand Tokyo this year and tour groups will be given discounts, but hedid not elaborate.   China has slashed air fares on 71 domestic routes by 20 percentto attract more passengers, and some branches of the state-run touragency have announced discounts of 10 percent to 20 percent onpackage tour rates.   Last month, China invited 400 travel agents from around theworld for a two-day, all-expenses-paid seminar to show how safe andnormal Beijing is.   Some travel agents said, however, that tourists would stay awayas long as martial law remains in effect in Beijing, where armedsoldiers guard intersections and bridges.</TEXT></DOC>
