The crash occurred after a controller permitted a USAirGroup Inc. jet to land on a runway occupied by a SkyWest Inc.commuter plane poised for takeoff just after sunset at LosAngeles International Airport, the nation's third-busiestairport. All 12 persons aboard the commuter plane werekilled, and 23 people on the Boeing 737 died, most from theinhalation of toxic smoke and fumes as they scrambled toescape.</LP><TEXT>   Management lapses &quot;created an environment&quot; in the LosAngeles tower that ultimately led to the failure of thecontroller &quot;to maintain an awareness of the trafficsituation, culminating in the inappropriate clearances andsubsequent collision&quot; of the two aircraft, the NationalTransportation Safety Board said yesterday in issuing itsfinal report on the crash.   It faulted Los Angeles tower managers for failing to enactthe required backup procedures and top officials forproviding insufficient oversight of tower managers. All toweremployees work for the FAA. The report was notable in that itzeroed in not so much on the mistakes made by the controllerinvolved, but on FAA management weaknesses.   &quot;Something is broken and needs to be fixed in the agency,and they better get on with fixing it,&quot; said NTSB member JohnLauber.   One of the biggest safety problems, the NTSB concluded,was the tower's handling of computerized flight progressstrips, which are passed from controller to controller tohelp keep track of the planes. The strip for one plane thatwasn't involved in the accident, a Wings West commuterflight, was misplaced by another controller and didn't reachRobin Wascher, the controller who was handling takeoffs andlandings.   Ms. Wascher, who still works for the FAA but not as acontroller, said at a hearing in May that the slip-up madeher mistakenly believe she was handling one less plane thanshe actually was. She believed, she said, that the Wings Westplane, which was on a taxiway, was the SkyWest aircraft. Inreality, the SkyWest plane was sitting on the runway, as Ms.Wascher had directed. She then cleared the USAir jet to landon the same runway. She was also distracted by acommunications problem with yet another plane, the NTSBfound.   Compounding the confusion, the board said, was the factthat the flight strips weren't being routed according to FAAprocedures. As a result, according to Mr. Lauber, the SkyWestplane's strip lacked a notation giving its location -- a notethat might have reminded Ms. Wascher that she had placed theSkyWest plane into position for takeoff, he said.   Reflecting its distress that many of the USAir passengerswere killed by toxic-smoke inhalation, the safety boardcalled on the FAA to set a deadline for the installation ofnewer, fire-retardant interiors in planes. The interiors arerequired on new aircraft, but existing planes need beretrofitted only during major overhauls. The USAir jet hadn'tbeen refurbished at the time of the crash.   Partly because of the Los Angeles accident, the FAAproposed in April that airlines be required to provide morespace at wing exits to allow quicker evacuation aftercrashes.   The NTSB also urged the agency to tighten airtraffic-control procedures at Los Angeles, a recommendationthe FAA promised to give &quot;expedited consideration.&quot; Shortlyafter the accident, the FAA took one step to reduce thepossibility of such collisions by generally prohibitingtakeoffs starting at intersections at night.   At the time, the accident led several safety experts tosuggest that the crash could have been prevented by aground-traffic radar system, which wasn't in operation. Butthe board, while expressing strong support for the radar,yesterday said the equipment probably wouldn't have preventedthe crash because controllers wouldn't have been using it,given the clear weather conditions.</TEXT></DOC>
