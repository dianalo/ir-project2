After considering commentsreceived after publication, and fee waiver policy guidance from the Departmentof Justice, OPM has revised its regulations on waiver of fees by addingthe standards that must be met to qualify for a waiver and by setting forthin greater detail the procedures for making a fee waiver determination.In addition, the regulations (1) update organizational information, and(2) now require prior notification of fees that apply when providing alternativerecords. In the interest of clarity, OPM is republishing the regulationshere in their entirety. OPM is also publishing in a separate document proposedregulations that (1) outline material that OPM generally makes availablefor public inspection and copying, and (2) implement the requirements ofExecutive Order 12600 concerning the release of confidential commercialinformation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>This rule becomes effective July 13, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </T2>C. Ronald Trueworthy, (202) 632-0261.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>OPM published interim rules with requestfor comment in the April 22, 1987,<T4> Federal Register </T4>(52 FR 13215). The rules brought the OPM intocompliance with the Freedom of Information Reform Act of 1986. Four organizations(a union, a public citizens group, a professional journalist society, anda Federal Government agency) commented on the regulations. The public interest group included in its submission extensive commentson the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) March 27, 1987 ``UniformFreedom of Information Act Fee Schedule and Guidelines''. In addition tolaw, OPM relied heavily on OMB's guidance in developing the portions ofthese regulations which deal with fee schedules. In our view, these guidelinesare a reasonable interpretation of the law. Since we view the guidancein this light, and since the Freedom of Information Reform Act requiresthat agencies issue regulations in conformance with guidelines promulgatedby OMB, we believe that this reliance is prudent. In any event, the commentsare pertinent to the OMB guidelines rather than OPM's regulations. The same public interest group also provided extensive comments on thefee waiver guidance provided to agencies by the Department of Justice (DOJ)rather than OPM's regulations. OPM did not consider DOJ's fee waiver guidancein developing its interim regulations. However, we have now reviewed theDOJ guidance, have concluded that it is well reasoned, and have taken itinto consideration in revising the fee waiver provisions in andSection; 294.109(d)as described below. Since it is DOJ's responsibility to provide guidanceto Federal agencies on this subject, we believe this is an entirely reasonablecourse of action. The following paragraphs discuss comments received on the OPM regulationsaccording to the section involved. <T3>Section 294.103(c) Definitions. </T3>One commentor argues that theOPM definition of ``representative of the news media'' is too restrictive,runs counter to the legislative history, and allows OPM to judge what iscurrent news before acting on the request. OPM believes its interpretationof ``news media'' is consistent with the statute and the OMB guidelinesand has made no revision to its final rule. The same commentor suggests that the definition for ``free-lance journalist''be deleted as it does not accurately reflect the way free-lance journalistswork and discriminates against first-time free-lancers. The legislativehistory describes free-lance writers as those ``who can demonstrate thattheir work is likely to be published * * *''. OPM considers its definitionto be consistent with the legislative history and OMB guidelines and hasmade no revision to its final rule. <T3>Section 294.107(h) Creating records. </T3>One commentor suggested arevision of this section to require that OPM provide prior notificationof any fees before transmitting alternative records. We agree that thisis a reasonable requirement and have revised the section accordingly. <T3>Section 294.109(b)(6) Payment of fees. </T3>One commentor suggestedthat this section should reflect only direct costs for searches and thatit should not include computer time, supplies, or any ``costs incurredas a result of malfunctioning equipment or other extraordinary problematicsituations of the agency which may bear on the time spent in the search.''Section 294.102 defines direct costs. If computer time and supplies satisfythe requirements of that definition, OPM shall include these costs in thecomputation of any fees. OPM does not, however, intend to include in feecomputations, costs caused by malfunctioning equipment or other eventswhich are clearly not related to a request. We believe that OPM can beexpected to use reasonable judgment in situations such as this, and thatthe regulations do not need to provide for all aberrations from normalcythat may occur. Therefore we are not adopting this suggestion.One commentor stated that there was nothing in the statute that permittedcharges for unsuccessful searches and that this was contrary to the intentof the statute and basic fairness. The statute provides for the recoveryof certain direct costs incurred in searching for records. It does notlimit cost recovery to instances when records result from the search. Sincethe requestor is the initiator of such searches, OPM is incurring a costthat it would not normally incur. Under these circumstances, fairness dictatesthat the Government ought to be able to recover its costs. This provisionis also consistent with the guidelines promulgated by OMB. For the reasonsstated above we are not revising this section. <T3>Section 294.109(c) Payment of fees in advance.</T3> One commentor statedthat this Section does not reflect the clear presumption against advancepayments in the wording of the Act. They suggest that OPM adopt wordingcloser to the OMB guidelines. Upon review, we have concluded that althoughthe wording is not identical to the wording in the OMB guidelines, themeaning is the same and we are not adopting this suggestion. One commentor objected to the potential interest charges provided for byparagraph (c)(3) of this section and pointed out that there is no statutoryauthorization for adding interest to FOIA charges. The regulations providethat OPM may begin assessing interest charges on an unpaid bill at therate prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3717, starting on the 31st day following thedate on which the bill was sent. OPM does not include interest when computingfees for Freedom of Information Act requests. If a requester does not paya fee on time, it becomes an overdue debt to the United States and is subjectto interest. The interest is a charge for overdue indebtedness to the Government,and not a Freedom of Information Act fee component. OPM believes that thisrequirement complies fully with law and with OMB guidelines and for thesereasons we are not revising this provision. <T3>Section 294.109(d) Waiver of fees.</T3> One commentor objected to theprovision of this section that allows an OPM official to deny a waiverof fees if a requestor does not provide an adequate explanation of whyhe or she is entitled to a waiver. The commentor pointed out that the regulationsdid not notify requestors of the standard they must meet in order to qualifyfor a waiver. Two commentors recommended that OPM should set forth in greaterdetail the procedures and standards it would use in making fee waiver determinations.After considering these comments, OPM has expanded on this section to providemore information on the evaluation of fee waiver requests. <ITAG tagnum="84">E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation </ITAG>I have determined that this is not a major rule as defined under section1(b) of E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>I certify that these regulations will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities because they will affect onlyFederal employees and agencies. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 5 CFR Part 294 </ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Freedom of information.<ITAG tagnum="20">U.S. Office of Personnel Management. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Constance Horner, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Director. </ITAG>Accordingly, OPM is amending 5 CFR Part 294 as follows: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 294_AVAILABILITY OF OFFICIAL INFORMATION </ITAG>1.

Overhead expenses (such as the cost of space, and heatingor lighting the facility in which the records are stored), are not includedin direct costs. ``Disclose or disclosure'' means making records available, on request,for examination and copying, or furnishing a copy of records. ``Duplication'' means the process of making a copy of a document necessaryto respond to an FOIA request. Among the forms that such copies can takeare paper, microform, audiovisual materials, or machine readable documentation(e.g., magnetic tape or disk). ``Records,'' ``information,'' ``document,'' and ``material'' have the samemeaning as the term ``agency records'' in section 552 of title 5, UnitedStates Code. ``Review'' means the process of initially examining documents located inresponse to a request to determine whether any portion of any documentlocated may be withheld. It also includes processing documents for disclosure;e.g., doing all that is necessary to excise them and otherwise preparethem for release. Review does not include time spent resolving generallegal and policy issues regarding the application of exemptions. ``Search'' means the time spent looking for material that is responsiveto a request, including page-by-page, or line-by-line identification ofmaterial within documents. The definition assumes that searches will becarried out in the most efficient and least expensive manner so as to minimizethe cost for both the agency and the requester. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 294.103</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89"> Definitions of categories and assignment of requests and requestersto categories. </ITAG>OPM will apply the definitions and procedures contained in this sectionto assign requesters to categories. The four categories established by5 U.S.C. 552(a) are requests for commercial use, requests for non-commercialuse made by educational or non-commercial scientific institutions, requestsfor non-commercial use made by representatives of the news media, and allothers. (a) <T3>Request for commercial use.</T3> A ``commercial use request'' is fromor on behalf of one who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthersthe commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or the personor institution on whose behalf the request is made. In determining whethera request properly belongs in this category, OPM will look first to theintended use of the documents being requested. (b) <T3>Request for non-commercial use made by an educational or non-commercialscientific institution.</T3> OPM will include requesters in one of thetwo categories described in paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this sectionwhen the request is being made as authorized by, and under the auspicesof, a qualifying institution; and the records are sought, not for a commercialuse, but in furtherance of scholarly or scientific research. (1) ``Educational institution'' refers to any public or private, preschool,elementary, or secondary school, institution of undergraduate or graduatehigher education, or institution of professional or vocational education,which operates a program or programs of scholarly or scientific research.(2) A ``non-commercial scientific institution'' refers to an institutionthat is not operated on a ``commercial'' basis as that term is referencedin paragraph (a) of this section, and which is operated solely to conductscientific or scholarly research, the results of which are not intendedto promote any particular product or industry. (c) <T3>Request from a representative of the news media.</T3> ``Representativeof the news media'' refers to any person actively gathering news for anentity that is organized and operated to publish, broadcast, or otherwisedisseminate news to the public. The term ``news'' means information thatis about current events or that would be of current interest to the public.Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations broadcastingto the public at large, and publishers of periodicals who make their productsavailable for purchase or subscription by the general public. Free-lancejournalists may be regarded as representatives of the news media if theydemonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication, or some other formof dissemination, through a particular organization even though they arenot actually employed by it. OPM will assign news media officials to thiscategory only when a request is not for commercial use. If a person meetsthe other qualifications for inclusion, OPM will not apply the term ``commercialuse'' to his or her request for records in support of a news disseminationfunction. (d) <T3>Requests from others.</T3> The category ``all others,'' consists ofany requesters not covered by paragraphs (a), (b), or (c) of this section.However, as provided by andSection; 294.105, OPM will use its Privacy Actregulations, rather than this subpart, when individuals ask for recordsabout themselves that may be filed in OPM systems of records. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 294.104</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89"> Clarifying a requester's category. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Seeking clarification of a requester's category.</T3> OPM may seekadditional clarification before assigning a person to a specific categoryif_(1) There is reasonable cause to doubt the requester's intended use ofrecords; or (2) The intended use is not clear from the request itself; or (3) There is any other reasonable doubt about qualifications that may affectthe fees applicable or the services rendered under andSection; 294.109. (b) <T3>Prompt notification to requester.</T3> When OPM seeks clarificationas provided by paragraph (a) of this section, it will provide prompt notificationeither by telephone or in writing of the information or materials needed.(c) <T3>Effect of seeking clarification on time limits for responding. </T3>Whenapplying the time limits in section 552 of title 5, United States Code,OPM will not officially consider any request for records as being receiveduntil the official who is assigned responsibility for making a decisionon releasing the records has_ (1) Received any additional clarification sought under paragraphs (a) and(b) of this section; and (2) Determined that the clarifying information is sufficient to correctlyplace the requester in one of the categories prescribed in this section.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 294.105</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Access to the requester's own records. </ITAG>When the subject of a record, or a duly authorized representative of thesubject, requests his or her own records from a Privacy Act system of records,as defined by 5 U.S.C. 552a (a)(5), and the record is maintained so thatit is retrieved by the subject's name or other personal identifier, OPMwill process the request under the Privacy Act procedures in Part 297 ofthis chapter. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 294.106</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Index of information. </ITAG>(a) OPM publishes OPM Document No. 1, ``Index to Information'' annuallyand issues supplements during the year when there is a sufficient volumeof new or revised material. This index contains material published andoffered for sale or available for public inspection and copying. (b) A copy of this index is available at no cost from the_<ITAG tagnum="25">Internal Distribution Subunit, Office of Personnel Management, RoomB443, 1900 E Street NW., Washington, DC 20415.</ITAG>(c) OPM indexes material for the convenience of the public. Indexing doesnot constitute a determination that all of the material listed is withinthe category that is required to be indexed by 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2). Mostof OPM's publications may be found in OPM's Library in Room 5H27 at theaddress listed in paragraph (b) of this section. (d) As provided by 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2), OPM has determined that it is unnecessaryand impractical to publish the ``Index to Information'' more frequentlythan annually because of the small number of revisions that occur. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 294.107</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89"> Places to obtain records </ITAG>(a) Address requests for OPM records to the officials listed in paragraph(b), (c), or (d) of this section.

If aperson has asked to be kept apprised of anything that will delay the officialreceipt of a request, OPM will provide notice of this forwarding action.Otherwise, OPM may, at its option, provide such notice. (f) <T3>Applying the time limits. </T3>When applying the time limits in section552 of title 5, United States Code, OPM will not officially consider anyrequest to be received until it arrives in the OPM organization that hasresponsibility for the records sought. (g) <T3>Records from other Government agencies. </T3>When a person seeks recordsthat originated in another Government agency, OPM may refer the requestto the other agency for response. Ordinarily, OPM will provide notice ofthis type of referral. (h) <T3>Creating records. </T3>If a person seeks information from OPM in aformat that does not currently exist, OPM will not ordinarily compile theinformation for the purpose of creating a record to respond to the request.OPM will advise the individual that it does not have records in the formatsought. If other existing records would reasonably respond to the requestor portions of it, OPM may provide these. If fees as provided in andSection;294.109 apply to any alternative records, OPM will advise the requesterbefore providing the records. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 294.108</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Procedures for obtaining records. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Mailing or delivering a request. </T3>Any person may ask for recordsunder section 552 of title 5, United States Code, by directing a letterto one of the organizations listed in andSection; 294.107, or by deliveringa request in person at the addresses listed in that section during businesshours on a regular business day. (b) <T3>Proper marking. </T3>Each request for records should have a clear andprominent notation on the first page, such as ``Freedom of InformationAct Request.'' In addition, if sent by mail or otherwise submitted in anenvelope or other cover, mark the outside clearly and prominently with``FOIA Request'' or ``Freedom of Information Act Request.'' (c) <T3>Contents of request letter. </T3>A request must describe the recordssought in sufficient detail to enable OPM personnel to locate the recordswith a reasonable amount of effort. (1) OPM will regard a request for a specific category of records as fulfillingthe requirements of this paragraph, if it enables responsive records tobe identified by a technique or process that is not unreasonably burdensomeor disruptive to OPM operations. (2) Whenever possible, a request should include specific information abouteach record sought, such as the date, number, title or name, author, recipient,and subject matter of the record. (3) If an OPM organization determines that a request does not reasonablydescribe the records sought, it will either provide notice of any additionalinformation needed or otherwise state why the request is insufficient.OPM will also offer the record seeker an opportunity to confer, with theobjective of reformulating the request so that it meets the requirementsof this section. (d) <T3>Medical records. </T3>OPM or another Government agency may disclosethe medical records of an applicant, employee, or annuitant to the subjectof the record, or to a representative designated in writing. However, medicalrecords may contain information about an individual's mental or physicalcondition that a prudent physician would hesitate to give to the individual.Under such circumstances, OPM may disclose the records, including the exactnature and probable outcome of the condition, only to a licensed physiciandesignated in writing for that purpose by the individual or his or herdesignated representative. (e) <T3>Publications. </T3>If the subject matter of a request includes materialpublished and offered for sale (e.g., by the Superintendent of Documents,Government Printing Office), OPM will explain where a person may reviewand/or purchase the publications. (f) <T3>Responses within 10 working days. </T3>Except in unusual circumstances(as defined in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)), OPM will determine whether to discloseor deny records within 10-working days after receipt of the request (excludingweekends and holidays) and will provide notice immediately of its determinationand the fees required, if any, as prescribed by andSection; 294.109 of thispart. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 294.109</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Fees. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Applicability of fees. </T3>OPM entities will furnish, without charge,reasonable quantities of material that they have available for free distributionto the public. Subject to payment of fees as specified in this section,OPM may furnish other material. These fees are intended to recoup the fullallowable direct costs of providing services. (b) <T3>Payment of fees. </T3>Individuals may pay fees by check or money order,payable to the Office of Personnel Management. (1) OPM will not assess fees for individual requests if the total chargewould be less than $25, except as provided in paragraph (b)(5) of thissection. (2) If a request may reasonably result in a fee assessment of more than$25, OPM will not release records unless the requester agrees to pay theanticipated charges.(3) If the request does not include an acceptable agreement to pay feesand does not otherwise convey a willingness to pay fees, OPM will promptlyprovide notification of the estimated fees. This notice will offer an opportunityto confer with OPM staff to reformulate the request to meet the requester'sneeds at a lower cost. Upon agreement to pay the required fees, OPM willfurther process the request. (4) As described in andSection; 294.107 of this part, OPM ordinarily respondsto Freedom of Information Act requests in a decentralized manner. Becauseof this, OPM may at times refer a single request to two or more OPM entitiesto make separate direct responses. In such cases, each responding entitymay assess fees as provided by this section, but only for direct costsassociated with any response the component has prepared. (5) OPM may aggregate requests and charge fees accordingly, when thereis a reasonable belief that a requester, or a group of requesters actingin concert, is attempting to break a request down into a series of requeststo evade the assessment of fees. (i) If multiple requests of this type occur within a 30-day period, OPMmay provide notice that it is aggregating the requests and that it willapply the fee provisions of this section, including any required agreementto pay fees and any advance payment. (ii) Before aggregating requests of this type made over a period longerthan 30 days, OPM will assure that it has a solid basis on which to concludethat the requesters are acting in concert and are acting specifically toavoid payment of fees. (iii) OPM will not aggregate multiple requests on unrelated subjects fromone person. (6) If fees for document search are authorized as provided in paragraph(f) of this section, OPM may assess charges for an employee's (or employees')time spent searching for documents and other direct costs of a search,even if a search fails to locate records or if records located are determinedto be exempt from disclosure. (7) Services requested and performed but not required under the Freedomof Information Act, such as formal certification of records as true copies,will be subject to charges under the Federal User Charge Statute (31 U.S.C.483a) or other applicable statutes. (c) <T3>Payment of fees in advance. </T3>If OPM estimates or determines thatfees are likely to exceed $250, OPM may require the payment of applicablefees in advance. (1) If an OPM official, who is authorized to make a decision on a particularrequest, determines that the requester has a history of prompt paymentof FOIA fees, OPM will provide notice of the likely cost and obtain satisfactoryassurances of full payment. (2) When a person, or an organization that a person represents, has previouslyfailed to pay any fee charged in a timely manner, OPM will require fullpayment of all fees in advance. In this section, an untimely payment isconsidered to be a payment that is not made within 30 days of the billingdate. (3) If a person, or an organization that a person represents, has not paidfees previously assessed, OPM will not begin to process any new requestfor records, until that individual has paid the full amount owed plus anyapplicable interest, and made a full advance payment for the new request.(4) If a request, which requires the advance payment of fees under thecriteria specified in this section, is not accompanied by the requiredpayment, OPM will promptly notify the requester that he or she must paythe required fee within 30 days and that OPM will not further process therequest until it receives payment. (5) OPM may begin assessing interest charges on an unpaid bill startingon the 31st day following the date on which the bill was sent. Interestwill be at the rate prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and will accrue from thedate of the billing. (6) To encourage the repayment of debts incurred under this subpart, OPMmay use the procedures authorized by Pub. L. 97-365, the Debt CollectionAct of 1982.
