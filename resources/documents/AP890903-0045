He was speaking in a telephone interviewfrom Riga, the Latvian republic's capital.   Concern over pollution is widespread in Latvia, Estonia andLithuania, which also are homes of popular movements for greaterautonomy.   Sunday's seaside protest was organized by the region's fledglingGreens environmental movement.   Many Baltic residents believe Moscow authorities have recklesslybuilt factories and plants that pollute the environment. They havepressed for local control over polluters and economic resources.   New measures beginning Jan. 1 will give Estonia and Latvia morecontrol over local factories.   This year's anti-pollution demonstration was overshadowed byother Baltic political events, journalists and activists said. AnEstonian Radio editor said thousands took to the beaches Sunday, butthe turnout was smaller than expected.   ``There were so many events already, people are tired,'' said theeditor, who spoke on condition of anonymity in a telephone interviewfrom Tallinn, the Estonian capital.   On Aug. 23, more than 1 million Baltic residents linked hands ina giant human chain stretching across the three republics. The chainwas formed to protest the Hitler-Stalin pact that led to the Sovietannexation of the Baltic nations.</TEXT></DOC>
