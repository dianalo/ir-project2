Contracts covering more than 4,600 members of the UnitedSteelworkers of America, including 3,500 at Cominco, and1,140 at Brunswick, a unit of Toronto's Noranda Inc., expireSaturday, and union bargainers said current contractproposals from the two mining concerns are far from adequate.</LP><TEXT>   Negotiators appear especially far apart at Cominco, whichhas had a stormy relationship with its unionized workers andwas hit with a costly four-month strike at its big Trail,British Columbia, lead-zinc smelter complex in 1987 duringthe previous round of contract talks.   At its capacity, the Trail smelter accounts for about 5.8%of the Western world's refined zinc output and 2.6% of itslead production. Cominco's contract talks cover workers atTrail and at British Columbia's Sullivan lead-zinc mine,where output was suspended this year due to losses.   &quot;Metals markets have been holding their breath waiting forthe outcome of {Cominco's} talks,&quot; said Victor Lazarovici, ananalyst at Toronto's BBN James Capel Inc. With lead and zincsupplies already hurt by disruptions, and inventories at lowlevels, Mr. Lazarovici sees prices for both metals &quot;going upsubstantially&quot; if settlements aren't reached.   &quot;We would very quickly go into a period of rising prices,&quot;concurred analyst Julian Baldry of Toronto's Nesbitt ThomsonDeacon Inc.   Mr. Lazarovici said zinc prices could reach or surpass theearly March peak of 85 cents (U.S.) a pound and lead wouldquickly jump past 40 cents. Lead peaked at 60 cents a poundin March. In London Metal Exchange spot market dealingsFriday, zinc closed at about 77 cents a pound and lead at38.5 cents.   Contract talks broke off late last week between Comincoand union negotiators after the Vancouver company proposed atwo-year pact with annual wage increases of 5% but nocost-of-living allowance, as the current contract provides.   &quot;Our members will reject this {proposal} by, I predict,over 90%,&quot; said Ron Schmidt, chief bargainer for theSteelworkers. &quot;If you take the COLA away, with a 5% wageincrease, they'll be paying us the same damn thing&quot; as underthe current pact, he said. &quot;It's absolutely outrageous.&quot;   Talks are expected to resume Thursday after union membersformally vote on the proposal and conduct a strike vote.Under provincial law, the union must provide three days'notice before going on strike.   Meanwhile, union bargainers are also recommending a strikeat Brunswick, whose lead-zinc mine near Bathurst, NewBrunswick, is expected this year to produce metal concentratecontaining about 250,000 metric tons of zinc concentrate andabout 68,000 metric tons of lead, according to John White,president and chief executive officer. That would account forroughly 5% and 1.5% of Western world production of zinc andlead, respectively.   Workers are scheduled to vote this week on a proposedthree-year pact that Brunswick calls its final offer. Itincludes a 20% wage boost over three years and increasedmonthly pension payments, including a big immediate boost.   But union negotiator Blair Doucet said the proposal isinadequate and that the union wants to make up ground aftersettling &quot;cheap&quot; in the last round of talks, which followedseveral years of losses. &quot;Now that they {Brunswick} aremaking money, we want our share,&quot; he said.   Last year, Brunswick earned 29.7 million Canadian dollars(US$25.2 million), or 80 Canadian cents a share. It sees netincome rising to about 84 cents a share this year.   If workers at Cominco and Brunswick come to terms withoutresorting to strikes, analysts said lead and zinc priceswould probably fall from current levels, which partly reflectanticipated supply disruptions. But they said underlyingdemand for lead, which is mainly used to make batteries, isstrong, and there is little new production coming onstream,largely because of environmental constraints.   Strikes or not, &quot;we're very optimistic on the outlook forlead prices because the supply is so constrained,&quot; said BBN'sMr. Lazarovici. As for zinc, he sees an immediate drop to&quot;the high 60s&quot; (cents) range, if the contracts are settled.</TEXT></DOC>
