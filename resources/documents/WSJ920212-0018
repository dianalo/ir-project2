Under the EC's complex rules, the assembly's decisionisn't legally binding. But the vote sends a powerful signalto the rule-making council of ministers, who have the finalsay on the issue.</LP><TEXT>   A ban on TV advertising went into effect last year. Thenew proposal, which Parliamentarians approved by a 150 to 123vote, would outlaw tobacco ads in magazines, newspapers andbillboards. Tobacco sponsorship of sporting events would alsobe outlawed. Ads would be allowed only inside tobacco shops.   The measure has been harshly criticized by industrylobbyists, who say it is an unfair attack on free speech. TheConfederation of European Community Cigaret Manufacturers, anindustry trade group, reasserted its members' rights &quot;toadvertise, to compete in a free market economy and tocommunicate its new product developments and innovations totheir consumers.&quot;   Under EC rules, the council of ministers now has severalmonths to come up with a compromise proposal, one that willtake into account, but not be as tough, as the blanket bansought by the parliament. The parliament can then reintroducetougher amendments to bring the proposal back up to itsstringent standards. But to do that, the amendments must beapproved by 260 votes, or a majority of the 518-member body.</TEXT></DOC>
