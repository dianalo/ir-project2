<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-31-0596 </DOCNO><TEXT>A high-speed pulsed eddy current system was designed and built for multipleproperty measurements at a bandwidth of 20 Mhz. The system is capableof detecting defects as small as 0.0006 inch in depth on either the interioror exterior surfaces of thin-walled stainless steel bellows tubing. Computeralgorithms were created to automatically size and locate defects. Thesystem is fully automated and capable of making accept/reject decisions.The feasibility of the method and the inspection capability of the instrumentare discussed. Schematics of the instrument are included and performanceresults are plotted.</TEXT></DOC>
