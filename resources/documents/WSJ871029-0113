But it's already clear that Democrats in Congress have greased the president's half of the rope, and are planning to raise taxes regardless of the negotiating outcome.    The irony of the budget summit is that the tax-increasers won't admit that, in a sense, they've already won. If indeed a symbolic tax increase is really necessary to cure all the ills of the nation, it is already in place. A Social Security payroll-tax hike scheduled for Jan. 1 will bring in more money than the $12 billion that the House Democratic tax bill wants to extract from the private economy.    In 1983, as part of a &quot;grand compromise&quot; on Social Security, President Reagan agreed to a series of hikes in the payroll tax. This January the tax rate paid by employees and employers will rise from 14.3% to 15.02%. Social Security taxes for a worker earning $30,000 will rise from $4,290 to $4,506. The revenue gain next year will be at least $15 billion.    In the past, payroll-tax rates have been raised because more revenue was needed to pay benefits. This increase, however, comes as revenues earmarked for Social Security programs are exceeding outlays by increasing amounts -- last year by $15.3 billion. In other words, this tax isn't needed to cover any retiree's check.    Whether a tax increase actually cuts the deficit, though, depends on its feedback effects on the general economy and revenues from other taxes. Gary and Aldona Robbins, two former Treasury Department economists, estimate that the January payroll-tax increase will lower 1988's gross national product by $33 billion, negating some of the benefits from next year's lower marginal tax rates.The reduction in GNP caused by new payroll taxes could, in turn, lower federal tax receipts by some $10 billion.    The January payroll-tax increase isn't the only tax hike planned by Washington. The Senate this week joined the House and raised Medicare premiums to fund a new catastrophic-health-care program. Maine's Democratic Senator George Mitchell blithely announced that this new premium tax had no relevance to the budget deficit. The legislation &quot;is, by its terms,&quot; he said, &quot;self-financing in perpetuity.&quot; We suspect so.    Today the full House is scheduled to vote on a Ways and Means committee tax bill explicitly designed to squeeze money out of investors, primarily by taxing takeovers. Committee Democrats made the takeover tax provisions retroactive to their Oct. 13 approval, a move that helped precipitate the market's collapse by prompting arbitragers to sell large blocks of takeover-target stocks. Given the current lack of investor confidence, these proposals are perverse.    The House vote today of course undercuts the work of the budget summiteers. This will be the second time now that Speaker Wright has welched on an understanding with the President; in early September he walked away from the Reagan-Wright Central American peace plan. House Minority Leader Bob Michel, normally a civil man, calls Speaker Wright's actions on the tax bill an act of &quot;bad faith.&quot;    It's clear that the much-touted &quot;budget summit&quot; is little more than a congressional Trojan horse bearing higher taxes. The Democrats' claims that they desire a careful review of federal-spending priorities lack any credibility whatsoever. We continue to believe that the budget-summit exercise will be a sham until the one proven tool of fiscal discipline -- the line-item-veto authority held by 41 state governors -- is laid in the center of the negotiating table. </TEXT></DOC>
