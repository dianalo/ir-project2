A company spokesman on Friday denied any wrongdoing.   The decision by the U.S. Justice Department to join an updatedversion of the suit filed by whistleblower Rod Stillwell wascontained in a U.S. District Court filing April 28, but neverformally announced.   The department had previously joined Stillwell in accusing thedefense contractor of $1.1 million in overcharges on onesubcontract for the Apache, which is the Army's newest anti-tankand anti-armor attack helicopter.   The latest filing in the year-old suit means the government alsosupports new allegations by Stillwell that the company engaged in apattern of overcharging on the program.   The company hasn't been served with the latest legal paperwork,but denies there was any overcharging, said Jim Ramsey, spokesmanfor McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Co., a subsidiary withheadquarters in Mesa, Ariz.   ``We continue to believe the allegations in the case are withoutmerit and we continue to cooperate with the government in a reviewof these matters,'' Ramsey said Friday.   Stillwell first made his allegations in 1984, when he was asubcontracts administrator at Hughes Helicopters Inc., which hassince been bought by St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas. He filedthe original suit in March 1987.   The suit was brought under the U.S. False Claims Act, whichallows a court to award the government treble damages. Depending onwhich legal theory is applied, that could amount to between $500million and $750 million, the suit says.   Under the act, which is intended to encourage employees to pointout fraud, Stillwell could get up to 25 percent of any damagesawarded.   Stillwell's attorney, William Ramsey, alleged that theovercharges represented an effort by the company to ``buy into''the Apache program by keeping costs artificially low early in theprogram.   ``They figured they could make it back later on,'' said Ramsey,no relation to the McDonnell Douglas spokesman.</TEXT></DOC>
