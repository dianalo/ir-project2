 Now researchers are also asking about the effects of informationtechnology on the social experience of individuals who use it, i.e., thenature of their jobs and the quality of their working lives.andP;  But the answersto these questions are not straightforward.andP;  As Attewell and Rule note, the&quot;research literature on the impact of new information technologies on jobcontent and job satisfaction provides a mass of contradictory findings [5, p.andO;1185].&quot;andM;Both economic and social theory as well as a rich case study literaturesuggest that while information technology may increase productivity it candegrade the work lives of those who use it.andP;  One way for employers to cutlabor costs is to substitute less experienced, educated, and skilledemployees for more skilled employees by using technology.andP;  Informationtechnology can aid this process in at least two ways.andP;  First, it canincorporate some skill and knowledge directly, requiring the user to haveless.andP;  Much special purpose expert system software avowedly has this aim.andO;More generally available technology on both the shop floor and in the office,including numerically controlled machine tools, spelling checkers, andsyntax-directed programming editors, can also be used in this way.andP;  Second,information technology can complement Taylorism--the fragmentation of anintegrated job into relatively autonomous components, with different laborersperforming different components--by aiding in the reassembling of informationthat is generated by separate individuals.andP;  Case studies and analyses byGlenn and Feldberg, Gregory and Nussbaum, and Murphree document occasions inwhich information technology has been used to incorporate workers' skills andto reintegrate information produced through fragmented jobs.andM;On the other hand, some researchers and analysts have argued thatcomputerized work is manifestly more fulfilling than conventional work.andO;According to this position, the most routinized work is most likely to beautomated, eliminating jobs requiring low skill and eliminating the mostboring and repetitive tasks within more skilled jobs.andP;  Poppel's analysis ofthe benefits of office automation for sales and information workers istypical.andP;  After studying 15 large U.S.andP;  organizations, he concluded that asalesperson's time is wasted on travel, missing contacts, finding outinformation, and filling out forms, while the time of many managers andprofessionals is similarly wasted on meetings and clerical work.andP;  Accordingto his analysis, office automation technology can rescue some of that wastedtime and make jobs more rewarding.andP;  In a more sophisticated and balancedanalysis, Attewell has shown how computerization has eliminated some of theroutine work of insurance examiners, such as calculating of deductibles oridentifying of potential duplicate payments, while at the same time leavingexaminers more time to make decisions about dubious claims.andP;  Zuboff hasargued that computerization has added intellectual content to work by makingactivities more abstract.andP;  (See also Baran for ways in which intellectualcontent is being reintroduced into while collar work.)andM;What leads to these contradictory results?andP;   The domainandM;is far more complex than the idealized rhetoric of deskilling or upgradingimply.andP;  As Attewell and Rule point out, the large number of variablesmoderating the effects of technology imply that both deskilling and upgradingare occurring within white-collar occupations.andP;  To determine which tendencypredominates would require quantitative studies that sample representativelyfrom firms and workers.andM;But even within a single organization, researchers often reach oversimplifiedand sometimes errneous conclusions because of methodological and conceptualflaws in their research.andP;  Empirically, researchers often use inappropriatemethodologies that confound the effects of technological change withpreexisting differences between workers or concomitant historical events.andO;Conceptually, the models they use to assess the effects of technology areoften too simple to capture the range and variety of variables implicated inthe technological change process.andP;  Kling and Scacchi's phrase &quot;web ofcomputing&quot; emphasizes the complexity and subtlety of the model one needs tounderstand the impact of information technology.andM;This article examines in detail what happened to productivity and quality ofworking life when a large company introduced a computerized record system.andO;An overarching goal is to illustrate via this case study the methodologicaland conceptual complexities involved in assessing technological effects.andO;After a brief discussion of the research setting, we review some problemswith common methods for assessing the effects of technologies and present alagged, time-series design that overcomes some of these problems.andP;  Using it,we present evidence that the computerized record system had powerful butvaried effects on productivity and quality of work life.andM;Because we studied a large, geographically dispersed company over time usingboth qualitative and quantitative research methods, we obtained an unusuallyrich picture of technological change in this company.andP;  The data led us toelaborate the simple technological impact model we developed initially.andP;  Theycaused us to challenge an assumption of monolithic change common intechnological impact studies by showing that the computer system haddifferent effects depending on workers' job category, the tasks theyperformed, and the types of offices they worked in.andP;  They also caused us tochallenge our assumption of one-way causation.andP;  The technology evolved asworkers used it in innovative ways.andP;  We conclude with a richer conceptualmodel of the processes of technological change.andM;THE RESEARCH SETTINGandM;The focus of the study is the work lives of customer service representativesin a large public utility.andP;  The customer service department in this companydeals with orders for service and billing inquiries for over 2.5 millioncustomers, making 5 million customer contacts per year.andP;  Servicerepresentatives are the highest-paid nonmanagement workers in the company.andO;Most have been with the company for several years and were promoted fromlower-level, clerical positions.andP;  They are the primary contact point betweenthe company and customers, providing information, solving customers'problems, collecting overdue bills, and selling new services.andP;  Our studyincludes 10 offices employing a total of 485 service representatives in 6cities.andM;Top management decided to automate the customer service department toincrease efficiency and cut labor costs.andP;  They installed equipment that wouldcomputerize information that service representatives had previously viewed onmicrofiche and altered by completing paper transaction records.andP;  Compared tothe microfiche system it replaced, the interactive computer system was toprovide service representatives with more recent billing information in amore convenient way and to allow interactive updating of customers' accounts.andO;No attempt was intentionally made to alter the service representatives' workprocesses more extensively.andP;  In particular, the technology did not alter therange of tasks that they performed and the importance of interaction withcustomers while performing these tasks.andM;The managerial goals that initiated the computerized record system--reducinglabor costs while maintaining service quality--placed only loose constraintson the technology that was developed.andP;  The record system was only one type ofcomputer technology that could have met these goals.andP;  Other options includeexpert systems that would automate credit decisions, and tool-based systemsthat would provide service representatives with more information for makingdecisions, answering questions, or providing additional services.andP;  In manyrespects, the record system was very similar to a commercial product used bysister utilities since the mid-1970s.andP;  By deciding to mimic an availablesystem, which in turn had mimicked the paper and microfiche system, thedesign team turned the computer, a potentially innovative tool, into arelatively passive device for retrieving and displaying information.andO;Although this decision minimized the disruption caused by automation, theutility inherited a set of work procedures and management philosophies thathad been in place since the early 1970s.andM;At the outset, the computerized record system was one element of alabor-reduction strategy that called for consolidation of offices from sixcities to two.andP;  However, halfway through the implementation, this decisionwas reversed: management decided that offices in all six cities would remainopen.andP;  Instead, the company would rely on an &quot;electronic consolidation,&quot; inwhich work overloads in one office would be transferred viatelecommunications to other offices around the state.andP;  This change wasdetermined by a number of factors, including rapid reduction in computing andtelecommunication costs; resistance from service representatives (especiallythose from the smaller offices whose jobs were at stake), their union, andfirst-line supervisors; and the greater efficiency, quality of service, andlabor stability of the small offices.andM;The Job before AutomationandM;In this company, the dominant characteristic of customer service work wascustomer contact: conversing with customers, negotiating with them, andsolving their problems and those of the company.andP;  The computerized recordsystem was not designed to affect the importance of customer contact inservice representatives' job description or the mechanics through which theyinteracted with customers.andM;Service representatives had two major responsibilities: to answer incomingcalls from customers and to make outgoing collection calls.andP;  On a typicalincoming call a service representative would explain charges to a customerand determine whether the charge was accurate.andP;  On a typical outgoing call, aservice representative would determine why a customer had not paid a bill,persuade the customer to pay it, and decide whether to extend credit to thecustomer.andP;  While these tasks represent approximately two-thirds of their workactivities, service representatives were also responsible for a wide range ofother customer contact activities which included handling emergencies;responding to complaints about annoying aspects of the company's service;suspending or disconnecting service; changing services; changing addresses;accepting credit card applications; answering queries about companyactivities, services, and products; and transferring customer calls to otherparts of the company.andM;To provide the informational support for these customer contact tasks, eachrepresentative had a microfiche reader and a set of microfiche copies ofrecent bills for all accounts serviced by that office.andP;  Older bills were keptin a central storage area, and service representatives had to leave theirdesks to retrieve them.andP;  In addition, each representative had primaryresponsibility for a subset of the accounts and kept trays of paper recordsregarding those accounts on his or her desk.andM;Incoming calls were routed through a central call distributor that connecteda customer to the next available service representative.andP;  Upon receiving acall, the service representative retrieved and displayed the microfiche copyof the customer's billing records.andP;  While looking at the customer's bill, theservice representative discussed the account with the customer, answeredquestions, made arrangements for payment, and attempted to sell new services.andO;For about half of the calls, a paper trial of the customer's problem hadalready been initiated, if, for example, the customer had been issued anoverdue notice.andP;  In such cases the service representative put the customer onhold, retrieved those paper records from the desk of whomever was responsiblefor that account, and returned to complete the call.andP;  Between calls or duringroutine interactions with long-winded customers, representatives completedthe clerical work generated by customer contacts (e.g., completing papertransaction records or refiling microfiche).andP;  This &quot;load balancing&quot; (fillingdead time with clerical work) and &quot;overlapping&quot; (finishing paper work for onecustomer while talking to another) were important skills that allowed servicerepresentatives to work efficiently.andM;Outgoing calls were conducted in scheduled blocks of time, during whichservice representatives did not answer incoming calls.andP;  Servicerepresentatives generated a prioritized list of customers who required areturn telephone call or who had an overdue account.andP;  They then made calls tothese customers, generally to inquire about unkept payment arrangements.andM;Of the 10 offices in this study, four served business customers and sixserved residential customers.andP;  The two types of offices represented distinctorganizational subcultures and service representatives in them differed intheir work responsibilities and tasks, pace of work, job satisfaction, andeven dress.andP;  Service representatives in business offices were generally moreprofessional: they had more responsibility, were more experienced, and hadfewer customer contacts per day.andP;  While service representatives in residenceoffices typically worked on small accounts involving tens or hundreds ofdollars, in business offices they were more likely to work on large accountsinvolving thousands and even hundreds of thousands of dollars.andP;  Approximately25 percent of the service representatives in business offices handledaccounts for one or two of the utilities' largest customers (government,military, or other large or special businesses).andP;  These servicerepresentatives were required to have detailed knowledge of the range ofservices their company offered and the administrative and financialprocedures followed by both their own company and their clients'.andP;  Forexample, adjusting the account of a government agency with a fixed fiscalbudget sometimes required what service representatives called &quot;creativeaccounting&quot; (e.g., floating the charges until the next budget period, workingwith counterparts within the agency to transfer funds from other accounts, ormaintaining a &quot;reserve record&quot; of the agency's over- and under-payments).andO;The difference in culture between business and residential offices evenextended to style of dress; service representatives in business officesdressed more formally.andM;The Job after AutomationandM;With the automated record sysem, the service representatives' contact withcustomers remained much the same, but the clerical aspects of the job changedsubstantially.andP;  Computer terminals replaced most microfiche readers, althougha few readers were still available in a central location for accessing oldbills.andP;  Service representatives retrieved a customer's record by entering thecustomer's identification number into a computer terminal.andP;  Because servicerepresentatives typed changes, payment arrangements and other commentsdirectly into the system, they generated few paper forms and avoided asubstantial amount of filing and other routine clerical work.andP;  This directdata entry also reduced their need to fetch paper records from others' desk,diminishing movement and social interaction throughout the office.andM;When they were not scheduled to take incoming calls, service representativesmade their outgoing collection calls.andP;  The computer rather than the servicerepresentatives generated the prioritized work list of accounts requiringaction.andM;Along with the introduction of the record system other changes in thetechnology and social organization of the customer service department weremade.andP;  First, almost all of the offices were moved to new quarters withmodular, ergonomically designed furniture.andP;  The office layout also changed;square arrangements of four desks separated by portable panels replaced rowsof desks, disrupting familiar seating arrangements and friendship patterns,and making informal chatting more difficult.andP;  Second, a new phone and calldistributing system, with increased reporting and monitoring capabilities,was installed.andP;  The reporting capabilities were used to schedule and managework loads, rather than to evaluate individual service representatives.andO;Finally, some changes in management policy were introduced.andP;  Most importantwas enforcement of an existing policy that all clerical work associated witha customer interaction be accomplished while the customer was on the line.andO;In large part, this change occurred because all work on one customer recordhad to be completed before a new record could be accessed.andP;  These changesreduced opportunities for service representatives to balance their work loador to overlap tasks in traditional ways, and created tensions as the servicerepresentatives raced to finish their work before hanging up on a customer.andM;MODELS AND METHODS FOR STUDYINGandM;TECHNOLOGICAL IMPACTandM;We examined the effects of the automated customer record system on the jobperformance and quality of work life of customer service representatives.andO;The basic hypothesis we were testing was that with the goal of improving theproductivity of their labor force, managers and implementors would designinformation systems that degraded the skills of their labor force and qualityof working life.andM;Technological impact models grossly oversimplify the process of technologicalchange in organizations by minimizing the interaction of implementation plansand efforts, the ongoing organizational system, and the technology.andP;  Yettheir very simplicity provides a useful starting point in analyzing the roleof technology in organizations.andP;  Technological impact models are one type ofdiscrete entity model described by Kling and Scacchi.andP;  Simple impact modelsassume that a fully-formed technology is injected into a social setting andhas direct causal effects on users' behaviors and attitudes.andP;  Recent studiesare typical of this approach.andP;  As Turner describes it, for example,&quot;...workers' attitudes and performance are a function of task characteristicsand structural arrangements which are, in turn, a function of the use andcharacteristics of...[a computer] system&quot; (see Figure 1).andP;  In this analysis,use of the computer system is the independent variable and work attitudes andperformance are the outcomes.andM;In the real world, testing even this simple model is difficult.andP;  The impactof a technological intervention is typically examined by comparing peopleexposed to the intervention with those unexposed and attributing differencesbetween them to the technology.andP;  For this research design to lead to accurateconclusions, the groups must have been similar to each other in all otherways prior to the introduction of the technology.andP;  While it is generallyaccepted that randomly assigning the intervention to people is the best wayof assuring their equivalence, this practice is generally impractical in theworkplace and is rarely done.andP;  Instead, researchers typically compare groupswo differ in their use of technology by historical happenstance (i.r., byusing) cross-sectional designs) or compare a single group before and after atechnology is introduced (i.e., by using pretest-posttest designs).andP;  Thesedesigns make it difficult to tell whether technology or other variables areresponsible for differences between groups or across time.andM;Cross-sectional designs generally use quantitative survey data to comparesimilar groups that use different technologies.andP;  Unfortunately, the groupsare rarely equivalent before the introduction of the technology and thesepreexisting differences are often mistaken for the effects of technology.andO;Such factors as the industry in which employees work, the size of theestablishment in which they work, their occupation, seniority, and age, andsubtle details of their work processes are rarely controlled when examiningthe so-called effects of computer technology.andP;  For example, if clerical jobsmonitored by computerized systems are in different industries than arenonmonitored jobs, one cannot unambiguously attribute differences inproductivity or job quality between these jobs to the use of computerizedmonitoring (cf.andP;  for this error).andM;Pretest-posttest designs, often using interview and observational methods,compare the same organization before and after the introduction of a newtechnology.andP;  Although this design effectively equates groups, it introducesother problems.andP;  In particular, researchers often mistake the effects ofhistory, extraneous events, changes in their own sensitivities, regressiontoward the mean, and other sources of invalidity for the effects of thetechnology itself.andP;  For example, organizations often introduce technology tosolve problems that have reached crisis proportions, such as excessive workloads resulting from changes in market conditions or expansion.andP;  In thiscase, the &quot;natural&quot; resolution of the crisis, including economic cycles,seasonal variations, and other, nontechnological adaptations of theorganization, are often mistaken for a technological impact (for example,natural crisis resolution may provide a good account for Murphree's data o ntechnological impact among secretaries in a law firm.andP;  See Campbell andStanley for a fuller discussion of sources of invalidity inquasi-experimental research.andM;We do not mean to challenge the value of previous research that used eithercross-sectional designs or  pretest-posttest designs.andP;  Rather, we urge thereader to bear in mind alternate explanations when interpreting theirresults.andM;DesignsandM;Because the utility introduced its automated system over a seven-month periodin 10 different offices, we were able to minimize several of the confoundsdescribed earlier.andP;  We did so by using a research design that combinedfeatures of both cross-sectional and pretest-posttest designs.andM;Figure 2 is a schematic representation of this lagged, time-series design.andO;In each of the 10 offices, we administered an evaluation questionnaire onemonth prior to the introduction of the record system (Pre), one month afterits introduction (Post1), and three months after its introduction (Post3).andO;This design minimizes confounds associated with time (specifically history,maturation, regression toward the mean, testing, and instrumentation effects)by comparing computerized and noncomputerized offices at the same time (e.g.,andO;in Figure 2, Office 1 Post1 compared with Office 3 Pre).andP;  The design alsominimizes the confounds associated with nonequivalent groups (specificallyselection, mortality, and interactions of selection with the effects oftime), by comparing the same people over time (e.g., in Figure 2, identicalrespondents in Office 1 Pre, Post1 and Post3).andM;The four-month data collection period at each site increased the likelihoodthat the effects identified were those associated with new technology and achanged clerical work process and were not simply the result of transitionper se.andM;The lagged, time-series design is neither the only nor the best mehtod forstudying the effects of technology, nor was our implementation of it withoutflaw.andP;  Time-series designs require advance knowledge of a technologicalimplementation and consume research resources over an extended period.andO;Moreover, they suffer from attrition, that is, different people may respondat different times, reintroducing the problems of non-equivalent comparisongroups.andP;  To solve this problem we analyzed data only from people whoresponded to all administrations of the questionnaires.andP;  This constraint onour sample combined with the small number of independent introductions of therecord system in the present study (10 different offices at 8 different timesin 6 different cities) limits the generality of our conclusions.andP;  Despitesthese problems, however, we believe that this design was useful in thepresent study and that it allowed us to accurately distinguish the effects ofthe record system from the effects of preexisting group differences orextraneous historical events.andM;Data Collection and RespondentsandM;Supervisors distributed questionnaires to approximately 415 servicerepresentatives (all service representatives in the state attending work onparticular days).andP;  The questionnaires were designed after 20 hours of on-siteobservation and several interviews with service representatives and theirmanagers.andP;  These observations helped us tailor questions to the tasks we werestudying.andP;  The quetionnaires were completed anonymously and returned insealed envelopes to the research team.andM;A total of 745 usable questionnaires were returned (327 Pre, 243 Post1, 175Post3), representing a response rate of 60 percent of the approximately 1250questionaires that could potentially have been returned given the numbers ofservice representatives reporting to work on a typical day.andP;  While 78 percentof respondents returned the first questionnaire, only 42 percent returned thelast.andP;  On average, respondents were 34 years old, had worked for the companyfor over 10 years, and over half had some college education.andP;  Eighty percentwere female.andM;Our analyses are based on 169 respondents who returned both apre-computerization questionnaire and at least one of the twopost-computerization questionnaires, and whose questionnaires we could matchthrough their voluntary use of a code number.andP;  Seventy of the time-seriesrespondents completed all three questionnaires, 88 completed both a Prequestionnaire and a Post1 questionaire, and 11 completed both a Prequestionnaire and a Post3 questionnaire.andP;  Given the large attrition in thelast wave of the questionnaire, to make efficient use of our sample, wecombined Post1 and Post3 responses, by using either the respondents' Post1 orPost3 responses, if they completed only one of these questionnaires, or themean of the Post1 and Post3 responses, if they completed both.andP;  The 169respondents for the time-series analyses represent a response rate of 40percent of the service representatives attending work on a typical day.andM;We performed analyses to determine whether we were justified in combiningPost1 and Post3 measures and whether the over representation of Post1questionnaires in the composite Post measure meant that we were assessing theeffects of transition rather than the effects of technology.andP;  Cross-sectionalanalyses of the dependent variables (see Table 1) using t-tests revealed nocases in which the Post1 measures differed reliably from Post3 measures andmany cases in which Pre measures differed from either Post1 or Post3 or fromboth of them.andM;We were also concerned that measurements taken only one month or even threemonths after the introduction of a computer system would reflect the effectsof transition per se, rather than any effects of technology.andP;  The process ofintroducing a new technology can disrupt an organization, and the rippleeffects might show up in the behaviors and attitudes of the users of thetechnology.andP;  In addition, the users' long practiced work skills and routinesmay well be disrupted by the introduction of new production technology.andP;  Toexamine whether pretest-posttest differences merely reflect the effects oftransition per se, present two types of data.andP;  Observations in the workplacesuggested that service representatives were using the new record systemcomfortably within a week of training, and in interviews conducted a monthafter its introduction service representatives claimed that their offices andjobs were &quot;back to normal.&quot;andP;  The short transition time reflects the limitedscope of the technological change.andP;  In particular, recall that the computertechnology was designed to influence only the clerical aspects of the job,not the more important customer contacts.andM;In a more systematic analysis, we examined plots ofandM;the dependent variables by time.andP;   These are presentedandM;in Figure 3.andP;  This examination revealed only two patterns of results, bothindicating relatively long-lived effects of technology.andP;  In the plateaupattern.andP;  Pre measures differed reliably from both Post measures, which inturn did not differ from each other (e.g., see the plots for variety,satisfaction with work group, impact, and pressure).andP;  In the linear pattern,change continued through the four-month measurement period, so that thedifference between the Pre and Post1 measures were continued in the intervalbetween the Post1 and Post3 measures (e.g., see the plots for frequency oftasks, ease of common tasks, and job quality).andP;  We saw no cases of a V orinverted-V shaped pattern indicative of simple transition effects, in whichvariables measured one month after the introduction of the technologydiffered reliably from the intitial pre-state, but quickly reverted to theinitial state.andP;  Together these observations and analyses suggest that we werejustified in performing a time-series analysis and in combining Post1 withPost3 measures.andP;  While we cannot tell what happened in this organization longafter the introduction of the computerized record system, our analysessuggest that the four-month data collect period we used was adequate, eventhough a longer period would have been desirable.andM;We also tested the generality and validity of our time-series analyses withtwo additional cross-sectional analyses of the data.andP;  We examined whether theresults we found among respondents who completed multiple questionnaires(time-series respondents) apply also to those who completed only onequestionnaire (drop-outs).andP;  A preliminary cross-sectional analysis revealedthat the computerized record system had similar effects on time-seriesrespondents and drop-outs.andP;  In an analysis of variance, of wave (Pre versusPost) by respondent type (time-series versus drop-out) on the 17 dependentvariables listed in Table I, only one interaction reached statisticalsignificance, just the number one would expect by chance.andP;  The similarity oftechnological impact on the two types of respondents is true even thoughtime-series respondents were more positive on most dependent variables beforethe introduction of the record system.andP;  For example, while the time-seriesrespondents were more satisfied with their jobs, reported better mentalhealth, and worked in offices with better management than did drop-outsbefore the introduction of the record system, the differences between the twotypes of respondents did not increase after its introduction, i.e., they werenot differentially affected by the computerized record system.andM;Measures of Productivity and Quality of Working LifeandM;The questionnaire included two types of measures: time-series andretrospective.andP;  The time-series measures asked respondents to describe theirjob experiences and beliefs at the time of questionnaire administration.andP;  Thesame questions were asked on all occasions, and technology effects werecomputed by comparing measures taken before introduction to measures takenafter.andP;  The questionnaires following the introduction of the record systemalso included some retrospective measures, which asked respondents to assesshow their jobs had changed since the record system had been introduced.andP;  Werely on data from the time-series measures because respondents often havedifficulty answering retrospective questions accurately; they tend toassimilate their previous attitudes to their current states and base theiranswers on their theories about the effects that technology should have.andP;  Weinclude results from the retrospective measures because they amplify the dataobtained from the more trustworthy time-series measures.andM;We examined the impact of the computerized record system on three broadareas: productivity, quality of work life, and attitudes toward computers.andO;We first observed service representatives on their jobs and then developedproductivity measures based on their reports of the frequency with which theyperformed important job-related tasks (e.g., finding a customer record,adjusting an account, deciding to allow a customer to defer payments, ormaking a sales attempt), and the ease of accomplishing these tasks.andP;  We couldhave preferred to use more objective data on productivity, such as the numberof customers served, or the productivity tallies made by servicerepresentatives at the time of a customer contact.andP;  The company, however, didnot keep this information on an individual basis, but aggregated it acrossworkers within an office.andM;To test hypotheses about the effects of information technology on thedeskilling or upgrading of work, we concentrated on assessing the nature ofthe jobs that service representatives performed and their reactions to them.andO;At the level of the individual worker, the deskilling hypothesis implies thatthe overall quality of jobs as experienced by their incumbents shoulddecrease.andP;  To the extent that the technology incorporates workers' skills,they should feel less challenged by their jobs.andP;  If the technologyincorporates some of their decision-making prerogatives, their autonomyshould be decreased.andP;  To the extent the technology makes the jobs moreroutinized, workers should experience less variety in their work.andP;  Ifseparate workers must coordinate their activities through databases ratherthan through direct communication, some of the social satisfaction of workwill decrease as workers are less connected to their primary work groups.andO;Finally, as is often the case, if the introduction of technology renders someskills obsolete while requiring workers to learn new ones to operate theequipment, workers may doubt the adequacy of their training.andP;  This degradingof the job itself may have two additional consequences.andP;  First, we wouldexpect workers to be less satisfied with a degraded job, and second, thedegraded job may lead to mental distress.andM;Measures of job satisfaction, job quality, and management quality were takenfrom the University of Michigan's project on assessing organization change.andO;The questionnaire included items to measure the components of job qualityassociated with what Locke [38] called &quot;mental challenge.&quot;andP;  We created a jobquality index that assessed the extent to which respondents described theirjobs as having autonomy, variety, challenge, impact on the company and itscustomers, and positive relations with members of a work group.andP;  To see moreprecisely what effects the technology had on job characteristics, we createdsubscales for each component of the job quality index, as well as measures ofjob pressure, management quality, and influence over the job.andP;  To ssessclaims that computer technology makes old job skills obsolete, we includedboth a self-report measure of the adequacy of service representatives'training and skills and a self-assessment of their work quality, compared toother service representatives.andM;The mental health scale included both assessments of respondents' happiness(e.g., the extent to which they felt that things were going their way) andtheir freedom from symptoms of depression and anxiety (e.g., symptoms such asfeeling depressed, apart of alone, or anxious), derived from items compiledfrom epidemiological surveys.andM;To test hypotheses that different classes of users, for example, olderworkers, would have more difficulty using computer technology and would bethus differentially affected by it, we included scales to measure attitudestoward computers and competence using them.andP;  Computer attitude and competenceitems were taken from Jay and Egan and Gomez.andP;  The computer attitude scaleincluded both general statements that computers had good or bad effects onsocial life and more specific statements that computers improved or decreasedproductivity in the work place.andP;  The computer competence scale was based onrespondents' reports of experience with computers and computer-like devices.andM;Examples of the items from these scales are listed in Table I, along with thenumber of items included in each scale, their internal reliability and theirfour-month test-retest reliability.andP;  Because we used only a small number ofitems to measure our dependent variables, some of the reliabilities reportedin Table I are substantially lower than those reported in  13].andP;  These lowreliabilities increase measurement error and, thus, increase the difficultyof identifying effects of technology, if they really exist (i.e., theyincrease Type I error).andM;In addition to these quantitative measures, we conducted 60 open-endedinterviews of service representatives and their managers two to four weeksafter the record system was introduced, and observed them in the workplaceboth before and after the introduction of the technology.andP;  These interviews and observations detailed many qualitative aspects of the setting, theactors, and the technological changes.andP;  They were crucial in establishing themeaning of the quantitative relationships obtained from the evaluationquestionnaires, for identifying constraints on managerial prerogatives indesigning the record system, and for noticing the ways in which servicerepresentatives modified the technology while using it.andM;THE IMPACT OF THE RECORD SYSTEMandM;Conceptually, given the lagged time-series design, the data needed to testwhether the automated record system had any impact on productivity or qualityof work life is simply the difference between measures collected before andafter the record system was introduced.andP;  Because the same individualsprovided data on at least two occasions and because these occasions weredistributed over a seven-month period for different groups of workers, thisdifference provides a relatively pure estimate of the effects of the recordsystem unconfounded with history or preexisting group differences.andM;We refined this simple measure by using multiple regression on the differencescores, to control for regression toward the mean and other statisticalartifacts involving preexisting differences among respondents.andP;  Specifically,each multiple regression predicted the difference between Post and Pre onsome dependent variable such a job quality, holding constant a respondent'sPre measure on that variable.andP;  We also controlled for the differentialeffects of the record system across the control variables of gender, age,offices serving business and residential customers, offices run by managersof different quality, offices of different size, and the offices thatintroduced the record system at different dates.andP;  Gender and office type(business versus residence) were dummy coded in the obvious fashion.andP;  Thequality of management was the mean within an office of servicerepresentatives' evaluation of their management as measured by the managementquality scale.andP;  Office size was simply the number of service representativesin an office; offices with more service representatives were in larger citiesand had more managers within their offices.andP;  The final control variable,conversion date or cut time, indicates the time at which the new recordsystem was introduced.andM;Table II shows the means of the productivity and quality of employmentmeasures before and after the record system was introduced.andP;  Post-meas wereadjusted by the control variables.andP;  The t-value in Table II is a statisticshowing the extent to which the change between pre-computer and post-computeris greater than what would expect by chance, given the sample size and thestability of these measures.andP;  It is comparable to a traditional t-test formatched pairs, but is based on the regression analysis described earlier.andM;Effects on ProductivityandM;We first examined the impact of the computerized record system in terms ofproductivity, managements' original reason for investing in the technology.andO;To understand the impact of the technology on productivity, it is importantto note that the company had previously reduced staff size in anticipation ofthe labor savings made possible by the record system.andP;  In some sense, then,the most tangible increase in productivity--reduced staff size to handle aconstant volume a business--occurred before the computerized record systemwas even installed.andM;Was management's anticipation of labor savings justified? According toservice representatives, it was.andP;  Based on their estimates of the number oftasks they performed per day, the record system increased the frequency ofwork related tasks by almost 50 percent (Table II, row 1).andP;  Moreover, inresponses to retrospective questions asked after the record system wasintroduced, service representatives reported that their personal productivityhad improved (* = 3.8 on a 5-point scale, where 1 indicates &quot;substantialdeterioration&quot; and 5 &quot;substantial improvement,&quot; t(398) = 15.7, p andless; 0.001,rejecting the hypothesis of no change).andP;  They also reported that the overallfunctioning of their office had improved (* = 3.9, t(399) = p andless; 0.001).andP;  Thiswas corroborated by interviews with managers.andP;  For example, after adoptingthe new record system, one office was able to handle an unexpected surge incalls that one manager claimed would have put them a week behind under theold system.andM;Moreover, several analyses suggest that the service representative job goteasier after the introduction of the computerized record system.andP;  In responseto a series of retrospective questions, respondents reported that the ease ofdoing their jobs had improved (* = 3.9, t(401) = 18.3, p andless; 0.001) since theintroduction of the record system.andP;  This was especially true of their abilityto perform their basic work tasks--handling a customer contact about acurrent bill, talking to a customer while recording information, adjusting anaccount, or deciding about extending credit (all t andgt; 8.5, all p andless; 0.001).andP;  Inaddition, according to time-series measures assessing the ease of performingspecific work related tasks, the record system had modest positive effectsoverall (Table II, row 2) and strong effects on high frequency tasks (TableII, row 2a).andM;The effects of the record system on productivity were not all positive,however.andP;  The computerized record system was primarily designed to supportthe most routine work performed by service representatives, i.e., handlingincoming calls about current bills; less attention was paid to how infrequenttasks (such as handling a question about an old bill, working with amultipage bill, handling an account when the records were missing) should behandled.andP;  These less common tasks became significantly more difficult to dowith the advent of the new record system (Table II, row 2B).andP;  Thus, while therecord system made performing high frequency tasks easier, it made performinguncommon tasks more difficult.andP;  This interaction between task frequency andtechnology was highly statistically significant ([beta] = 0.43, t(145) =6.12, p andless; 0.001).andM;Some deleterious effects of the record system on service representatives'productivity were revealed in other ways as well.andP;  After using the recordsystem, respondents felt themselves to be less adequately trained and skilledto do their jobs, and more likely to come across problems that they did notknow how to solve (Table II, row 3).andP;  Some of their skills became obsolete orless relevant, while the system required new skills that they had to develop.andM;Although the computerized record system made the routine aspects of their jobquicker and easier, it had no effect on how well service representativesbelieved they performed their jobs in comparison to their peers, eitherglobally or in specific domains such as their effectiveness in sales, debtcollection or customer contact work (Table II, row 4).andM;The computerized record system was designed to increase servicerepresentatives' efficiency and to reduce their numbers.andP;  To a large extent,it accomplished these goals; however, in designing the system, littleattention was paid to other jobs that would be affected.andM;Supervisors, who evaluated service representatives by auditing records ofcompleted transactions and periodically monitoring customer contacts, foundtheir jobs to be much more difficult after the computerized system wasintroduced.andP;  Evaluation became more time-consuming; for example, the timerequired to audit an account on the computer increased by a factor of 10 fromthe time required to review paper records.andP;  This was compounded by thelimited availability of the information they needed.andP;  Much of it wasavailable only on the computer, which for security reasons was accessibleonly during business hours.andP;  Overflow work that had previously been done athome in the evenings or on weekends now had to be squeezed into businesshours.andP;  The computerized record system also generated stacks of output,reporting every transaction for the day.andP;  Supervisors did not know how to usethis information to evaluate service representatives and found the volume ofoutput oppressive.andM;A final and more general change produced by the switch to the new system wasa shift in the locus of task knowledge.andP;  Most supervisors had previously beenaccomplished service representatives.andP;  With the new system, however, theywere no longer experts in the operational detail of the work.andP;  In fact, fewsupervisors had more than rudimentary knowledge of the new system, therebydiminishing expertise as a basis of authority over their reportees.andM;To competently perform their jobs in the face of these difficulties,supervisors had to rely on their general knowledge of customers' problems, torely on their leadership and interpersonal skills, and to work harder.andP;  Thisshift in the bases of competence is reflected in service representatives'belief that in general their local management and supervisors were performingtheir jobs better after the introduction of technology than before (Table II,row 14).andP;  In interviews, service representatives reported being impressedwith their supervisors' handling of the transition to the computer system,especially the way in which they had responded to the pressure anduncertainty of the changes.andP;  In addition to these transitional effects,service representatives also recognized the reservoirs of general skillstheir supervisors possessed and perceived them as being good sources of helpwhen problems arose.andM;Effects on Quality of EmploymentandM;A number of measures show that service representatives' jobs became lesssatisfying, less interesting, and generally of poorer quality following theintroduction of the computerized record system.andP;  Overall, representativesliked their jobs significantly less after the computerized record system wasintroduced (Table II, row 5).andP;  Furthermore, in retrospective evaluations,they reported that both the overall interest level and enjoyment of the jobhad deteriorated after the computerized record system was installed (* =2.86, t(399) = -2.55, p andless; 0.02).andM;We can understand more precisely the way in which the computerized recordsystem affected job satisfaction by examining both the quantitative andqualitative evidence of changes in working conditions.andP;  In general theworking conditions as measured by the Michigan Quality of Working Life scalesdeteriorated following the introduction of the computerized record system(Table II, row 6).andP;  Examining the components of job quality in more detailshows that service representatives' work had less variety (Table II, row 7),was less challenging (Table II, row 10), and that service representativeswere less able to see the results of their work (Table II, row 11).andO;Furthermore, contact with work colleagues became a less frequent and lesssatisfying component of service representatives' work life (Table II, row 8).andM;How did these changes occur?andP;  The interview data suggest that they resultedpartly from changes in social interaction, based on new seating arrangements,new privacy panels, and service representatives' limited physical movementthat come from their coordinating information through a database rather thanthrough word of mouth and the transfer of documents.andP;  In this setting part ofthe decrease in job quality, which is often hypothesized to be a result ofcomputer technology, was the result of changes in office layout andarchitecture that were ancillary to modifications in office procedure andonly loosely linked to computerization.andP;  At a minimum this analysis suggeststhat the definition we use of technological impact must to expandedsubstantially to include these nonintrinsic changes in work place and workprocedure that often go hand-in-hand with the introduction of computertechnology.andM;The effects associated with the privacy panels and architecturalrearrangements seemed short-lived.andP;  Within a week after the new system wasinstalled, service representatives reported that they had learned to talkaround or over the panels.andP;  Supervisors agreed that the goal of reducingnoise in the office had not been accomplished.andP;  Likewise, although the newseating arrangements disrupted existing friendship groups, new allianceseventually formed.andM;The more lasting change was serice representatives' increased confinement totheir desks.andP;  Before the computerized record system, service representedcoordinated some of their work through face-to-face interaction as theymanually exchanged paper files and microfiche records.andP;  Although servicesrepresentatives wrote comments on service records that should have beensufficient for another representative to continue a customer contact, theyoften exchanged fuller details of more complex and memorable cases by word ofmouth as they exchanged the records themselves.andP;  Occassionally they wouldalso pass along information about a customer's reputation, which was legallybarred from that customer's official credit history with the company, butwhich service representatives found relevant when making credit decisions.andO;In addition, service representatives explained that getting up to fetchrecords, which they would for about a quarter of customer contacts, hadprovided them with the opportunity to chat briefly with each other and keepin touch with the rest of the office.andM;After the system was introduced more coordination occurred passively, withall service representatives having access to up-to-date, computerized filesdescribing a transaction.andP;  Many opportunities for interaction disappeared andservice representatives feld isolated.andP;  In the words of one servicerepresentative,andM;I don't know what's going on with anybody anymore.andP;  Just today I found outthat one of the women over there's husband was in a car wreck three days ago,and I haven't even said anything to her.andP;  .  .  .  And it's not all justpersonal stuff, either.andP;  We used to help each other with calls--problems andstuff--or just complain, to blow off steam.andP;  That's gone too, and we justdeal with it by ourselves.andM;In contrast to these negative effects of technology on job quality, otheraspects of the job improved after the computerized record system wasintroduced.andP;  Because the most common tasks became easier after automation,representatives reported significantly less job pressure after theintroduction of the billing system than before (Table II, row 12).andP;  That is,even though they were performing more tasks per day, they believed that theiroverall work load had been reduced, that they could work slower, and thatthey were less likely to face time pressures to complete work.andM;After the introduction of the computerized record system respondents reportedthemselves as happier and having fewer symptoms of depression and anxiety(Table II, row 13).andP;  This was especially surprising, because mental healthwas moderately associated with job satisfaction (for the full sample[gamma](729) = 0.43) and quality of work life ([gamma](729) = 0.25), each ofwhich deteriorated with automation.andP;  These were offset, apparently, bylowered job pressures and improvements in management, each of which wasassociated with improved mental health (for job pressure [gamma](729) = -0.24and for management [gamma](729) = 0.27).andM;Attitudes toward ComputersandM;Although not a prime focus of our study, it is interesting to note howservice representatives' use of computer technology affected their beliefsabout it and their competence using it.andP;  As service representatives usedcomputers more, they developed more negative attitudes toward them, findingthem dehumanizing and unlikely to have a productive impact on job performance(Table II, row 15).andP;  As one would expect, as respondents used computers more,they became more confident and believed they were more knowledgeable aboutthem (Table II, row 16).andM;The Power of Technological ImpactandM;How important is technological impact?andP;  We examined this question bycomparing the strength of the technology effect to the strength of othervariables that one would expect to have important influences.andP;  By thiscriterion the impact of technology was powerful, indeed, having effects asstrong as the major influences on service representatives' productivity andquality of working lives.andM;The comparison variables are the same as those used as control variables inTable II--respondents' gender, their age, whether they worked in business orresidence offices, the quality of the management in the offices in which theyworked, the size of the office, and the month in which computerization oftheir office started.andP;  The comparison variables were treated as theindependent variables in multiple regression analyses and the mean over timeof each productivity and quality of work life measure was the dependentvariable.andP;  These regressions thus examine the size of the statistical effectsof the independent variables (gender, age, etc.) on each of the dependentvariables (frequency of tasks, job satisfaction, etc.) while holding constantall other independent variables.andP;  Absolute, standardized [beta] weights areused to summarize these analyses, because they provide a measure of thestrength of effect independent of scale.andM;Figure 4 displays boxplots that show the size of the technology andcomparison effects on productivity and quality of employment expressed interms of mean, absolute, standardized [beta] values.andP;  Figure 4 reveals thatthe record system had effects as powerful as those from other importantvariables.andP;  According to interviews, the major influences on all aspects ofservice representatives' work lives were the size of the offices in whichthey worked (offices varied in size from 17 to 96 service representatives)and whether the office served business or residential customers.andP;  Theseactions influenced many aspects of their jobs including work load, workchallenge, and the quality of friendships on the job.andP;  As Figure 4 shows,technology had effects approximately as large as these (average [beta]between 0.24 and 0.25).andP;  Working with computers rather than microfichetechnology changed service representatives' work lives approximately as muchas working in an office with an additional 26 employees (i.e., doubling thesize of small offices).andP;  It had approximately as much effect as working in abusiness office rather than a residential one.andP;  The effects of technologywere far larger than the influences of age, gender and even the quality oflocal management on service representatives' productivity and quality ofemployment.andP;  In terms of quality of employment, working with the computersystem rather than the microfiche was like working for the top 5 percent oflocal managers rather than the bottom 5 percent.andP;  The power of the technologyeffect is surprising because the computer system itself influenced arestricted area of the representatives' tasks--the way in which they accessedcustomer service records--and left many other aspects of their workunchanged.andM;The Limits on Technological ImpactandM;A relatively circumscribed technological change in a skilled clerical job hadmajor effects on job performance and job quality.andP;  While these effects arelarge compared to other factors influencing job performance and quality inthis company, they were not monolithic as might be implied by a simpletechnological impact model.andP;  The assumption of monolithic change--that theeffects produced by technological innovations are uniform--was not confirmedby our data.andP;  In terms of job performance, the record system made routinework easier, but extraordinary work harder and it made the work of servicerepresentatives easier, but that of their supervisors harder.andM;The basic method for examining the variation in the technological impact onquality of employment was multiple regression analyses that test thestatistical interaction of the impact of the record system with the controlvariables used in Table II--respondents' gender, their age, whether theyworked in a business or residence office, the quality of their management,the size of their office, and the month in which computerization of theiroffice started.andP;  These regression analyses are identical to the ones formingthe basis of Table II and use the difference between post-computerizationmeasures and pre-computerization measures as the dependent variable and thecontrol variables as independent variables.andP;  A statistically significantinteraction indicates that the effect attributable to the introduction of therecord system differed for different values of the control variables (e.g.,andO;the record system had different effect on men and women or on workers inbusiness offices and residential offices).andP;  The size of these interactionswill be reported as [beta] values in the text.andP;  Representative examples areshown in Figure 5.andM;Office Type InteractionsandM;Business and residence offices differed substantially in many facets of workexperience.andP;  In terms of productivity service representatives in residenceoffices handled more calls per day (main effect of office-type [beta] = 0.56,p andless; 0.01) and found their work tasks harder ([beta] = 0.32, p andless; 0.01).andP;  Interms of quality of work life, service representatives in residence officesliked their jobs less ([beta] = -0.28, p andless; 0.01), had lower quality jobs([beta] = -0.51, p andless; 0.01), had more pressure on the jobs ([beta] = 0.27, p andless;0.01), poorer mental health ([beta] -0.31, p andless; 0.01), and perceived theirmanagement as being of poorer quality ([beta] = -0.16, p andless; 0.05).andP;  Giventhese large differences in office culture, one might expect that technologywould have different effects in the two types of offices.andP;  This expectationis confirmed by the data.andM;Many of the effects of the computerized record system depend on whetherrepresentatives worked in residence or business offices.andP;  In general, bothpositive and negative effects of the record system were substantially largerfor residence offices than for business offices.andP;  For example, as Figure 5ashows, the new technology increased the frequency with which servicerepresentatives performed tasks more in the residence than in businessoffices, (interaction [beta] = 0.35, p andless; 0.01).andP;  It also increased thedifficulty with which they performed low frequency tasks more in theresidence offices ([beta] = 0.18, p andless; 0.05).andM;Similar interactions exist for quality of work life measures.andP;  Jobsatisfaction (Figre 5b, [beta] = 0.18, p andless; 0.05) and overall job quality([beta] = 0.28, p andless; 0.01), and its components--variety ([beta] = 0.16, p andless;0.05), autonomy ([beta] = 0.17, p andless; 0.05), challenge (Figure 5c, [beta] =0.26, p andless; 0.01), and perceived impact ([beta] = 0.16, p andless; 0.10)--alldecreased more for representatives in residence offices.andP;  The only exceptionto the general trend of stronger technology effects in residence offices wasthat service representatives there reported less improvement in the qualityof their management ([beta] = -0.15, p andless; 0.10).andM;How does one explain these differing effects of identical technology amongworkers with the same job title in a single company?andP;  First, and most simply,service representatives in business offices used the computerized recordsystem about 36 minutes less per day.andP;  It was a less integral part of theirwork responsibilities because they worked more frequently with old orcomplicated billing records that were not available in the computer system.andO;Equally as important, however, service representatives in the businessoffices had a generally more professional culture, while those in theresidence offices had less autonomy and less flexibility in carrying outtheir jobs.andP;  For example, a representative in a business office who hadpreviously worked in a residence office commented, &quot;I won't go back overthere for anything.andP;  You have to ask permission just to go to the bathroom.andO;Over here, they at least realize I'm a professional adult.&quot;andP;  As a result,technology had more deterministic impact among service representatives inresidence offices.andM;Management Quality InteractionsandM;The interaction analysis also shows that some negative effects of technologywere reduced and some positive effects were enhanced in offices with higherquality management.andP;  In offices with better managers, technology decreasedjob satisfaction less ([beta] &quot; -0.27, p andless; 0.10), and increased mental healthmore (Figure 5d, [beta] = 0.34, p andless; 0.01).andP;  It also reduced job pressure more(Figure 5e, [beta] = 0.35, p andless; 0.01), decreased positive attitudes towardcomputers less ([beta] = -0.35, p andless; 0.01), and increased judgments of thequality of management more ([beta] = 0.41, p andless; 0.01).andM;Office Sized InteractionsandM;In general, larger offices were better places to work than smaller ones; jobsatisfaction was higher, job variety and challenge was greater, and workersexhibited better mental health.andP;  Despite these findings, some negativeeffects of technology were reduced and some positive effects were enhanced insmaller offices.andP;  In smaller offices, technology increased mental health more(Figure 5f; [beta] &quot; 0.36, p andless; 0.01) and decreased job challenge less (Figure5g, [beta] = -0.33, p andless; 0.05).andP;  It also made service representatives moreconfident about using computers ([beta] = 0.30, p andless; 0.01), improved theiropinions of their management more ([beta] = 0.35, p andless; 0.05), decreased theirbeliefs that they were ill trained for their jobs less ([beta] = -0.32 p andless;0.10), and decreased their opinions of computers less ([beta] = -0.37, p andless;0.05).andM;Individual Difference InteractionsandM;In general, the effects of technology did not depend on individualcharacteristics of the service representatives.andP;  We examined interactionswith gender and age as well as measures of service representative's jobexperience, their self-rated skill on their job, their attitudes towardcomputers, and their skill with computers.andP;  The lack of many reliableinteractions suggests that the technology was equally accessible to allservice representatives, regardless of age, experience, gender, or priorexperience with computers.andM;Although age had reliable main effects on several measures of job quality andattitudes toward computers, it did not interact with the effects oftechnology.andP;  The failure to find pervasive age interactions is surprising inlight of previous research suggesting that older individuals have moredifficulty learning to use procedurally complex computer systems.andM;The data show only one reliable gender interaction: technology harmsrelationship with work group members more for women than for men (Figure 5h,[beta] = -0.15, p andless; 0.05).andM;Time of Implementation InteractionsandM;The computerized billing system was introduced at different times indifferent offices over a period of seven months.andP;  Some of the effects oftechnological change depended on when the technology was introduced.andO;Improvements in mental health symptoms were larger for earlier introductionsof the technology ([beta] = -0.32, p andless; 0.01).andP;  Larger decreases in jobvariety ([beta] = -0.18, p andless; 0.05) and job challenge ([beta] = -0.16, p andless;0.10), and smaller decreases in positive attitudes toward computers ([beta] =0.29, p andless; 0.01) were observed in offices that introduced the technologyearlier.andM;These time differences may simply reflect the statistical artifacts resultingfrom the unique histories of difference offices during the implementationprocess.andP;  They are difficult to interpret without supplementary interview andobservational data because they could be due to a variety of factors:seasonal variations, extraneous events (e.g., an impending strike) or tochanges in the system software/hardware, training procedures, or expectationsas a result of the experiences of previous offices.andP;  For example, the largerimprovements in mental health symptoms observed in the first offices are mostlikely due to the initial anxiety service representatives describedsurrounding the introduction of the new system--would the system work, andcould service representatives use it effectively?andP;  Both representatives andmanagement it later offices did not have this initial anxiety, because theywere informed by the experiences of the early users.andM;ONE WAY CAUSATIONandM;Technology, broadly conceived, can have large effects on workers, but thesize of these effects and even their direction can depend on the workers' jobcategories, the detailed tasks they perform, and the local culture in whichthey use the technology.andP;  In this section we show that not only doestechnology have effects on workers, but they in turn modify the technology.andM;The Evolution of the Technological ConfigurationandM;&quot;Reinvention&quot; is the degree to which an innovation is changed by the adopterin the process of adoption and implementation after its original development.andO;Sometimes this happens as users modify the concrete hardware and softwareproduct, sometimes as they apply their own, personal procedures to use it,and sometimes as they treat it as a symbol of other organizational andpersonal issues.andP;  Johnson and Rice examined reinvention in word processingsystems, taking a high-level view of how uses of word processing and theservices provided by word processing centers changed in 194 organizations.andM;In the company that we studied, service representatives had little directinvolvement in the design of the computer software and hardware or theassociated organizational and architectural changes.andP;  They did, however, havea large role in determining how the software was actually used.andP;  They quicklymastered the procedures defined by the system designers and covered duringthe training, and immediately set about finding new, improved ways of doingthings.andP;  Many of these discoveries involved faster ways to traverse anaccount and to find the information they needed.andM;However, one innovation, which involved their ability to overlap their work,had more far-reaching consequences.andP;  The ability to overlap (i.e., performseveral tasks simulateneously), once the hallmark of the competent servicerepresentative, was less important with the new computerized record system.andO;To continue to exercise this skill that the computer had threatened to renderobsolete and to perform their jobs more efficiently, service representativesfound an innovative way to use a feature of the new system known as &quot;dualscreens.&quot;andP;  The dual screens feature was originally designed to allow users toeasily switch between two separate customer databases, one for billinginformation and another for sales information.andP;  Service representatives soonfigured out, though, that it was possible to log on to the billing databasetwice, allowing them to switch back and forth between two accounts, eitherduring or between calls.andP;  Although originally resisted by management, thisnew way of overlapping became so popular that it finally became officiallysanctioned.andM;A second user-designed innovation involved the creation of a clandestinenote-passing network within the customer record system.andP;  The record systemwas not designed with electronic mail facilities, and most managers supportedthis decision.andP;  Service representatives, however, circumvented this lack ofelectronic communication by leaving each other personal notes in a field ofthe database record that was intended for descriptions of customers'problems.andP;  Although, supervisors strongly discouraged this practice, theywere powerless to prevent it.andM;The evolution of the utility's record system manifested both changes thatfell in line with management's goals of increased efficiencies and those thatreflected service representatives' interest in maintaining social contact.andO;In our interviews, we found that service representatives were more likely toexperiment and try new ways of using the system when their supervisorsencouraged such behavior, and that certain confident individuals quicklybecame known as inveterate experimenters.andP;  This supports Johnson and Rice'sfindings that reinvention was linked to training, encouragement ofexperimentation, communication, and participation in other kinds ofdecision-making.andM;DISCUSSIONandM;Computerization of even a small component of a job can have profound effectson job effectiveness and employment quality, but these effects do not conformto simple models.andP;  We have shown that after service representatives beganusing a computerized record system, their work lives changed.andP;  The changesassociated with computerization were as large as any other natural source ofvariation that we could identify in this setting.andP;  Moreover, our methodsallowed us to conclude with reasonable certainty that the changes we foundwere the result of technology, broadly conceived, and were not the result ofmethodological artifacts, preexisting differences between groups, orextraneous, historical factors.andP;  We concentrated on solving methodologicalproblems in establishing the causal impact of technology, because until wecan distinguish causal impact from methodological artifact, moresophisticated questions about the generality of effects, mediation ofeffects, and direction of causation cannot be addressed at all.andM;Some of the changes caused by introducing the customer record system werethose explicitly intended by its designers: the most common parts of theprimary users' jobs became quicker and easier to do.andP;  As a result, thetechnology reduced their job pressure and, surprisingly, increased theirhappiness and mental health.andP;  It also made them believe their managers weremore competent.andP;  These data support arguments that office automationtechnology, primarily used to increased productivity, can at the same timeupgrade jobs.andM;On the other hand, the technology had other effects on quality of work lifeexpected by those who see technology as degrading jobs.andP;  The record systemmade the service representatives' jobs less satisfying.andP;  It deskilled thejobs, both by making them less complex, interesting, and challenging, and bymaking service representatives' previous skills and training less relevant toa changed work process.andP;  The technology decreased workers' satisfaction andinvolvement with their work colleagues.andP;  Finally, while having positiveproductivity effects on the service representatives, it had negative effectson their supervisors.andM;Although we have shown substantial effects of introducing a new computerizeddatabase into an organization, we have also demonstrated the inadequacy ofconceptualizing them through a simple technological impact model asillustrated in Figure 1.andP;  Technology not only includes computer hardware andsoftware, but also work procedures, management practices,physical/architectural arrangements, and productivity and qualityspecifications.andP;  We have shown here, for example, that servicerepresentatives' lack of integration with their work groups, an apparenteffect of computer technology, was also the result of accompanying changes inprocedures and physical surroundings.andP;  Similarly, their increased respect fortheir supervisors was based in part on the supervisors' demonstration ofleadership abilities when their task-specific expertise was threatened by thenew technology.andP;  One must include elements of this larger technologicalconfiguration in models of technological change.andM;We have also shown that the assumption of monolithic change, implicit in manytechnological impact models, is also incorrect.andP;  Many of the changes weidentified had varying consequences depending upon the setting in which theyare introduced.andP;  The technology had smaller effects in the business officeswith their professional work culture and lower dependence on standardprocedures.andP;  In both smaller offices and offices with better management, manynegative effects of technology were reduced and positive ones enhanced.andO;Since business offices, smaller offices, and ones with better management allhad more flexible work arrangements, these findings are all consistent withthe assertion that local flexibility moderates the way technology is used.andM;At a minimum, the divergent effects of technology we found among servicerepresentative are consistent with recent research demonstrating the range ofoutcomes that can result when information technology is introduced into thework place.andP;  Our study forcefully shows that identical hardware and softwarewithin a single company can have positive effects on one job and negativeeffects on another, and can even have mixed effects on different aspects ofthe same job.andP;  These data demonstrate the oversimplicity of earlier workportraying office automation in either starkly negative or positive terms.andO;They are, however, consonant with observations by Mumford, among others, thatunless the quality of working life is explicitly addressed and advocated inthe design of technology, business and development pressures will force somedegradation of it.andM;The history of this computer system provided evidence that technology effectswere not unidirectional: implementors and users modified the technologicalconfiguration as it modified their work.andP;  A problem with simple technologicalimpact models is their assumption that causality in technological change isone-way: that managers and designers influence technology and both influenceworkers, but neither is strongly influenced by workers or by the vagaries ofthe implementation process.andP;  This assumption ignores the extent to which anytechnological configuration is itself a historical product of social,economic, and political decisions that shape it, and downplays thesignificance of modifications that occur as it is implemented and used.andO;Automation did not unfold unswervingly from overarching goals, and the natureof the technological configuration itself changed in response toenvironmental changes, political demands, and chance circumstances.andM;Figure 6 illustrates a more complex and we believe more accurate model fortechnological impact, as we found it in this case study, than does the simplemodel in Figure 1.andP;  Figure 6 extends the simple impact model in three ways:by expanding what one considers the technology to be; by identifyingindividual and organizational contingencies that moderate the impact oftechnology; and by recognizing the bidirectional nature of technologicalchange.andM;First, in the revised model, technological change extends beyond hardware andsoftware, and includes the wider, intrinsic changes in organizational designand work procedures that are embedded in the context of work technology, ofwhich the computer technology is only one part.andP;  The utility's record systemwas associated with vacillating decisions to consolidate offices and withchanges in the way service representatives scheduled tasks and coordinatedcases among one another.andP;  Moreover, the introduction of new technology isoften an occasion for implementing extrinsic changes, such as the replacementof furniture that occurred in the present offices.andP;  Both the intrinsic andextrinsic changes associated with computerization need to be explicitlyconsidered in the technological impact model.andM;Second, the revised model also recognizes that variations in the way that thetechnology is introduced and variations in the environments into which it isintroduced have implications for the effects the technology is likely tohave.andP;  In general, in the present study, when the record system wasintroduced into a flexible environment, it had more benign effects.andM;Third, the revised model has a systems flavor to it.andP;  It recognizes thatorganizations introducing technology are complex systems slowly changing overtime.andP;  New technology is but one perturbation around which the systemadjusts.andP;  Thus both managers modify some of the goals they had in introducingtechnology when they start to see some of its effects, and users of thetechnology adapt it to their previous work procedures, as well as adaptingtheir work procedures to it.andM;While this model is by no means complete, we believe that it captures some ofthe richness of the technological change process.andP;  Research should bedesigned with this model of impact in mind to avoid missing importanteffects.andP;  A goal of research should be to refine the model.andM;Acknowledgments.andP;  We would like to thank Diane Duffy, Ed Fowlkes, and DeborahSwayne for their statistical advice and Carmen Egido, Dennis Egan, Rob Kling,and two anonymous reviewers for advice that led to improving the clarity ofour argument.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
