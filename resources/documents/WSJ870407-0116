Puth, has proposed a management-led leveraged buyout of the company for $11.50 a share, or about $78.7 million.    The maker of industrial products for transportation equipment and fluid power systems said it has been informed that the management-led group expects to receive financing from a leading investment banking firm and that investors in the buyout would include existing institutional holders of the company's stock. The company declined to disclose the banking firm.    Clevite, which had 6.8 million shares outstanding at Dec. 31, said a special committee of the board, consisting of four outside directors, has been formed to receive and evaluate the proposal.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Clevite shares rose $2.50 to close at $11.25.    In a leveraged buyout, investors acquire a company largely with debt that ultimately is paid with funds generated by the acquired concern. </TEXT></DOC>
