The simple answer is that the law wasunconstitutionally timid. The justices said in effect thatvictims' groups need to be more ambitious by demandingconfiscation of income from criminals beyond their books ormovie deals.   As a legal matter, the justices had no alternative but torule that the Son of Sam law is unconstitutional. The law,passed after mass murderer David Berkowitz sold rights to hisstory, required that anyone convicted or even accused of acrime must turn over royalties or other proceeds fromarticles, books or other creations to the state Crime VictimsBoard.</LP><TEXT>   The Supreme Court said that targeting First Amendmentspeech this way is unconstitutional because singling out thisactivity unreasonably threatens free speech. The court gave aboost to &quot;commercial speech&quot; by noting that while peoplecould still write books under the law, they would be chilledbecause they couldn't get paid. There was alsooverinclusiveness. Justice Sandra O'Connor noted the lawwould have covered St. Augustine's &quot;Confessions&quot; because headmitted stealing pears from a vineyard. We agree that theidea of punishing people who were never convicted of anycrime is bizarre.   The silver lining in the opinion is that the justices saidthat the problem here was that New York limited theconfiscation of money to the proceeds of activities thatraised these First Amendment concerns. The court made clearthat there would be no problem with a law that applied to allincome, or a percentage of all income, that a convictedcriminal earns after he commits a crime.   The law after this decision in Simon andamp; Schuster v. NewYork Crime Victims Board is that states are free to collectfunds for victims, including the income criminals receivefrom books or movies, but that these funds can no longer belimited to these speech-based activities. &quot;In short, thestate has a compelling interest in compensating victims fromthe fruits of the crime,&quot; the justices said, &quot;but little ifany interest in limiting such compensation to the proceeds ofthe wrongdoer's speech about the crime.&quot;   In this case, former Mafia &quot;wiseguy&quot; Henry Hill admittedto the book publishers that he committed crimes, but he wasnever convicted in any court. Still, there is nothing to stopthe victims of his alleged crimes from suing him now for allthe proceeds of his storytelling to pay for the damages hecaused. Likewise, if a Jeffrey Dahmer decides to sell therights to his grisly story, the Supreme Court emphasized thatthere is no problem with state laws that allow court-orderedforfeitures of funds to benefit his victims or theirrelatives.   The impetus for the New York law and similar laws in moststates is the simple observation that our criminal-justicesystem works brilliantly for criminals, but is a miserablefailure for victims. In places such as New York City, fewerthan one percent of felonies results in anyone going to jail.We owe this result to a generation of exclusionary rules andthe ACLUing of the courts. The spectacle of criminals sellingtheir stories for cash was the last straw.   No one thinks that justice is done just because a criminalloses royalties or other income to his victim. This is nosubstitute for full criminal justice or any alternative tostopping crime before it occurs. Still, no one should readthe decision in this case as helping criminals avoid havingto compensate their victims. The justices have not declaredthat crime should pay.</TEXT></DOC>
