But when Rockwell International Corp. received a $110,000 civil penalty last year from the EPA for dumping the same type of wastes in its nuclear-weapons work at Rocky Flats, Colo., the company had greater latitude to fight. It wasn't Rockwell lawyers, but attorneys from the Energy Department, which runs the nuclear-weapons program, who argued Rockwell's case before the EPA and who reduced the fine to $79,000. Then the Energy Department reimbursed its contractor for the amount of the fine.    While the Energy Department admits that its hazardous and radioactive waste problems are staggering -- it will cost roughly $180 billion to clean up the entire program at all 14 sites that produce material for nuclear weapons -- the department and its contractors remain shielded to a great degree from environmental regulations, lawsuits and public scrutiny.    &quot;There is no other federal agency that is as insulated from outside oversight as the Department of Energy,&quot; said Daniel Reicher, senior project attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, a public-interest group that today will announce new efforts to sue the Energy Department to comply with environmental laws on the restarting of aging nuclear reactors at the Savannah River nuclear-weapons facility in South Carolina. &quot;Enforcement of environmental laws is the question,&quot; Mr. Reicher said.    The Energy Department holds its contractors harmless because the production of nuclear weapons is considered a public service.    &quot;But I see a big distinction in indemnifying contractors in the case of a nuclear accident because it was producing materials for national defense and between complying with straightforward hazardous-waste laws,&quot; said Christopher Grundler, director of federal facilities in the EPA's hazardous-waste compliance office.    Nonetheless, the Justice Department has ruled that the EPA may not sue the Energy Department for not following EPA regulations, because both fall under the executive branch. Nor can the EPA order the Energy Department to comply with hazardous-waste laws.    Private citizens and state governments may file suit to force compliance, but financial settlements are limited, and enforcement actions are rarely spelled out.    Anthony Celebrezze, Ohio attorney general, refused to sign a consent agreement to force the Energy Department to curb hazardous-waste dumping at the plant in Fernald, Ohio, because the agreement contained no means to enforce it. &quot;It was a useless piece of paper,&quot; he said.    Even the Natural Resources Defense Council, which has won nearly a dozen suits involving hazardous wastes in the past 15 years, has seen its victories limited to mostly procedural matters, such as preparing environmental-impact statements before starting up nuclear reactors.    &quot;It's ludicrous to expect that states and citizens groups will have resources to enforce environment laws,&quot; said the council's Mr. Reicher. &quot;We're one of the few private groups that can take on cases like these.&quot;    The Energy Department maintains it has taken a more forceful approach toward its contractors' environmental compliance, and has begun studies of the enormous clean-up jobs that lie ahead at the weapons sites, including Fernald. &quot;The department is well aware of the need for remedial actions at the Fernald facility,&quot; Eric Fygi, acting general counsel for the department, last week told a congressional committee that heard the complaints of Fernald residents.    As previously reported, the department admitted last week that it ordered its contractor, NL Industries Inc., to continue dumping radioactive and hazardous waste at the site over a period of years.    Yesterday, Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste called the department's statement an &quot;admission of deceit and mismanagement,&quot; and entreated President Reagan to close the site until the extent of contamination could be discerned. </TEXT></DOC>
