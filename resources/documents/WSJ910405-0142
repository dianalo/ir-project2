Some of the funds, which invest in foreign securities,adjustable-rate mortgages and commercial loans originated bybanks, have offered returns of about 10% in the past year.That can make the funds look especially attractive thesedays, when the average money-market mutual fund yields only alittle more than 6%.</LP><TEXT>   But investment advisers warn against &quot;stretching&quot; forhigher yields. Some of these innovative fixed-income fundsmay be riskier than they appear at first glance. One highlypopular type of fund offering a yield tied to the prime rateis drawing a close look from federal regulators.   &quot;A lot of people attracted by these funds with newwrinkles don't realize they can lose some principal,&quot; says P.Kemp Fain Jr., president of Asset Planning Corp., a financialplanning and investment advisory firm in Knoxville, Tenn.&quot;These are not the same as money-market funds. It's reallyplaying with fire if you're not careful.&quot;   In tough economic times, investment advisers say, manypeople may be better off with more traditional, conservativeinvestments, such as money funds, certificates of deposit,short-term Treasury notes and high-grade, tax-free municipalsecurities that mature in three years or less.   Here's a look at three of the popular new products beingoffered by funds and Wall Street brokers -- and at some ofthe risks investors should know about before agreeing to handover any money.   Global Income Funds. Known more fully as global short-termfixed-income funds, these invest in securities issued inother countries, where interest rates often are sharplyhigher than in the U.S. British government bonds due in 1992,for example, now yield about 10.5%.   Global income funds were star performers last year, buthigher overseas interest rates weren't the only reason. Thedollar's tumble in world foreign-exchange markets played abig part, too. That's because the declining value of thedollar made the fund's foreign-currency income worth more toAmerican investors when it was converted into U.S. currency.   But analysts say these funds will prove less attractive ifthe dollar continues surging, as it did in this year's firstquarter. &quot;Anytime you invest in a foreign currency, you'vegot a significant risk,&quot; warns Don Phillips, editor of MutualFund Values, a fund-rating publication of Morningstar Inc. inChicago. &quot;It's quite a leap from the security of a money fundto go to these types of funds.&quot;   Fund managers use hedging strategies to help protectagainst wide currency swings. Many also argue that investorscan benefit from international diversification. Remember,though, that income on international funds is fully taxableat the state and local level, unlike interest on U.S.Treasury securities.                                                                                                          ARM Funds. These funds, which invest in securities backedby adjustable-rate mortgages, have been attracting moreinvestors with their high returns.   For example, Franklin Adjustable U.S. GovernmentSecurities Fund had a total return of 10.09% in the 12 monthsended March 31, according to Lipper Analytical Services Inc.That is well above the 7.47% return on money funds during theperiod.   Some fund analysts say there isn't anything wrong with theconcept of an adjustable-rate mortgage fund, but comparisonswith money funds make them nervous. The reason: Share pricesof adjustable-rate mortgage funds fluctuate. FranklinAdjustable's share price for instance, has ranged as high as$10.33 in 1988 and as low as $9.93 in 1989. Recently, it hasbeen hovering just above $10.   That isn't much volatility. But it does make the fundsdifferent from money funds, which are designed to maintain aconstant $1-a-share net asset value. People who go for thenew funds should understand that distinction, analysts say.                                                                                                          Prime-Rate Funds. These funds typically buy pieces ofcommercial loans and are designed to offer a floating ratelinked to the prime rate. The prime, which is a benchmark formany types of business and consumer loans, is currently 9% atmost big banks.   Investors have poured over $6 billion into five funds.Top-ranked over the 12 months ended March 31: Allstate PrimeIncome, with a 9.93% total return, followed closely by VanKampen Merritt's Prime Rate Income Trust, at 9.91%, accordingto Lipper Analytical. Van Kampen's fund now holds more than100 separate senior secured bank loans, says Jeffrey W.Maillet, its manager. That, he says, &quot;spells out gooddiversification.&quot;   Fund officials, however, confirm that the Securities andExchange Commission recently asked them for more informationabout their holdings. The SEC is especially interested in howthe funds value those holdings, a complex question sincethere isn't an active &quot;secondary,&quot; or resale, market for mostsuch loans.   SEC officials won't discuss the inquiry. SEC ChairmanRichard Breeden has been doggedly pursuing efforts to getfinancial institutions to use more current values for theirdebt holdings. Some fund managers speculate that the SECmight issue new directives that result in greater volatilityin the funds' net asset values.   Up to now, those values have remained relatively stable.For example, the net asset value of Eaton Vance Prime RateReserves has ranged between $10 and $9.96 since it began inthe summer of 1989, says James B. Hawkes, the fund'spresident. The fund's total return was 9.29% in the yearthrough March.   Whatever happens with the SEC inquiry, there are otherreasons for investors considering prime-rate funds to makesure they know what they're getting into. &quot;People should becareful not to confuse them with either a money-market fundor a highgrade fund,&quot; cautions A. Michael Lipper, presidentof Lipper Analytical.   For instance, investors who want to get their money haveto wait for specified time periods, typically once a quarter,during which they can sell their shares back to the fund. Thefunds, though, aren't always obligated to do so. The fundsalso generally charge higher fees than many other funds, andinvestors also may be hit with special charges if they selltheir shares prior to certain dates.</TEXT></DOC>
