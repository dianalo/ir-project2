As previously reported, the Chicago-based maker of business graphics equipment agreed last month to sell the Web Press Group to Komori Printing Machinery Co. of Japan in a transaction valued at more than $250 million. That agreement permitted AM to negotiate with other parties for the sale of the unit.    AM said Heidelberger, a manufacturer of sheet-fed offset presses, will pay about $230 million, assume $52 million in debt and pay about $18 million of certain other costs associated with the transaction.    AM said proceeds will be used to reduce debt and strengthen its balance sheet.    For the year ended July 31, 1987, the Web Press Group, which makes web printing presses, had sales of $327 million; AM had sales of $1.2 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
