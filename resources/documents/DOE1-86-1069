<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-86-1069 </DOCNO><TEXT>Cholecystokinin (CCK) binding sites have been described in several areasof the brains with particularly rich localization being found in thethalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). We have studied the distribution ofCCK binding sites in the TRN using a high resolution autoradiographictechnique and observed that the CCK receptors were dense throughout thewhole nucleus. Using Kainic acid excitotoxic lesions, it was demonstratedthe CCK receptors were attached to postsynaptic elements and not afferentfibers. These results are discussed in view of the known functional roleof the thalamic reticular nucleus as an inhibitory control, gating allthalamic sensory transmission systems. 21 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
