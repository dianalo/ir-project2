Army sources said late Wednesday that about 30 Contra rebelsattacked an 18-man military command in Muan, a town 136 miles eastof the capital.   The attack Tuesday night was led by rebel commanders known as``Pipilacha'' and ``Capulina'', the sources said.   They said the rebel leaders, who entered Nicaragua from CostaRica last December with about 200 men, have established themselvesin the country's southeastern region.   The government and U.S.-supported rebels reached a cease-fireagreement March 23, but talks on a permanent truce to the 8-yearcivil war broke down in September. Each side accuses the other offrequent cease-fire violations.   Killed in the attack were soldiers Miguel and Ismael MaltezHernandez, whom town residents said were recent draftees.   The injured were identified as Lt. Roger Miranda Martinez andJulio Aguilar, a delegate of the governing Sandinista NationalLiberation Front.   No rebel injuries or deaths were reported.   The Defense Ministry late Tuesday reported that three farmworkerswere killed and another three injured in a similar rebel attack Jan.2 in La Maranosa, 8 miles south of Wiwili near the Honduran border.   The Sandinista party newspaper Barricada recently reported thatrebel forces were planning ``sensational attacks'' in hopes ofconvincing President-elect Bush to renew military support for therebels, which expired last year.</TEXT></DOC>
