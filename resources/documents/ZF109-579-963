(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>The RevolutionandM;The companies that sell servers are reluctant to talk turkey about numbers.andO;Of the &quot;big three&quot; (Gupta, Oracle, and Microsoft), we estimate that Gupta isapproaching 3,000 units sold, Oracle possibly 4,000, and Microsoft's SQLServer something like 1,000.andP;  IBM got a late start in the database servermarket because their first entry was single user.andP;  The new extended editionhas caught the attention of a lot developers who are mindful of IBM's hugeinstalled base of systems.andP;  SQL Server has received the most attention.andO;Analysts argue it offers the most advanced features, generally focusing onthe &quot;back-end intelligence&quot; features, namely stored procedures and triggers.andO;But the niggling questions remain: When will database servers begin todeliver on their extravagant promises?andM;Is the database server revolution on schedule or has it missed the boat?andM;These questions have been bothering me wih increasing intensity for more thantwo years now.andP;  I was an early true believer in client-server technology.andP;  In1987, I was working the &quot;bleeding-edge beat&quot; as editor of The NetworkReport--the Local Area Network Dealers Association (LANDA) newsletter--whenLAN Manager and SQL Server were introduced.andP;  I spent weeks at Microsoftheadquarters and conferences around the country admiring slideware andhearing speeches about how, with OS/2 and client-server technology,microcomputer networks would begin to replace minicomputers and mainframes inthe coming avalanche of &quot;downsizing mission-critical applications.&quot;andP;  Databaseservers were going to serve as the foundation for the next generation of LANsby boosting performance and enabling sophisticated decision-support systems.andO;Network utopia has been slow to materialize, however, and so far databaseserver companies would rather discuss potential than profitability.andM;Big DreamsandM;SQL Server was introduced in late 1987 as the technology that would makeemploying PC networks in &quot;mission-critical&quot; situations possible.andO;(&quot;Mission-critical&quot; implies counting money.)andP;  Networks were not just forworkgroups any more.andP;  They were growing up to provide enterprisewidesolutions.andP;  Big dreams.andM;The original plan was for Microsoft to take technical responsibility for theSybase SQL Server on OS/2 platforms.andP;  Ashton-Tate was to handle SQL Servermarketing and distribution.andP;  They promised to modify dBase IV to work withSQL Server, and all dBase programs would &quot;migrate transparently&quot; to the newplatform.andP;  With thousands of dBase programs in use and SQL Server solvingdBase IV's performance problems, projections called for sales of SQL serverunits in the tens of thousands.andP;  For its part, Ashton-Tate was hoping SQLServer would provide a late-life kicker for dBase IV.andP;  Later, other vendorslike Revelation Technologies, Borland, DataEase, Lotus, Nantucket, Microsoft,and scores of independents would add their own support, expanding the marketin quantum leaps.andP;  That was known as the &quot;front-end strategy,&quot; and it wasperfectly reasonable.andP;  It just never happened.andM;A common explanation for database servers' failure to achieve high salesmaintains that the dozens of front-end databases, spreadsheets, reportwriters, and many more development tools from independent publishers have notbeen delivered.andP;  True, but why?andP;  After all, most of these same publishershave been working on their SQL Server-compatible versions for more than twoyers.andM;Front ends for SQL Server have not shipped for two principal reasons: First,the complexity of engineering the marriage between SQL Server and the variousfront-end products was grossly underestimated.andP;  The high difficulty, coupledwith low sales figures for SQL Server, reduced economic motivation and sloweddevelopment projects.andP;  Some analysts argue that old-style front-ends willnever work effectively with SQL Server.andM;Second, SQL Server has been a casualty in a marketing war between Microsoftand Novell competing for the position of network operating system of choicefor the 1990s.andP;  The war stalled sales by restricting SQL Server to LANManager networks and Novell under OS/2.andP;  Support for DOS workstations onNovell networks was very late in arriving, finally showing up in July 1990.andO;By that time, competition had begun to mobilize.andM;Is there any cause for optimism after all this time?andP;  You bet.andP;  Plenty ofevidence shows that the logjam is about to break loose.andP;  When that happens,developers who adopt SQL Server will begin to deliver the systems of thefuture.andM;The Lure of SQL ServerandM;The essence of a database server is to separate company data from theapplication program that accesses that data.andP;  Concurrency, integrity, andsecurity are enforced at the server rather than in the application program,permitting multiple application programs to access the same data at the sametime.andP;  The implications for systems integration are exciting.andP;  Lotus 1-2-3spreadsheets can draw on data in the accounting system to produce graphs of acompany's key performance indicators in real time.andP;  Inconsistent andredundant data in company databases is reduced.andP;  Cross-application reportingbecomes feasible.andP;  And, in keeping with microcomputer tradition, users arefree to choose whatever software tools suit their taste.andP;  Standardizingproductivity tools becomes irrelevant.andP;  A lot of arguments just disappear.andM;Client-server architecture provides other benefits.andP;  Database operations areexecuted on the server, drastically cutting down network traffic and boostingperformance.andP;  Since security, data integrity, and business rules areprogrammed at the server, development time is cut down and programmaintenance is reduced.andM;And then there's the matter of pedigree.andP;  SQL Server was ported to OS/2 byMicrosoft.andP;  The parent product is the Sybase SQL Server, a minicomputerdatabase server successful in the minicomputer world since 1987.andP;  Finally, in1988, Ashton-Tate was the leader by a wide margin in delivering databasesystems to the microcomputer community.andP;  By early 1988, it looked like thetrio of partners had all the pieces in place.andP;  But success was elusive.andM;LAN Manager SuffersandM;SQL Server was a child bride to LAN Manager.andP;  Remember, the real stakes wereon the race between Novell NetWare and Microsoft LAN Manager; SQL Server wasfrosting on LAN Manager's cake.andP;  Microsoft wanted a slice of Novell's $422million network operating system business.andP;  For that reason, SQL Server waspositioned by Microsoft to run exclusively on LAN Manager networks at thebeginning of 1988.andP;  The theory was that SQL Server would help drive up salesof LAN Manager and cause companies to change from NetWare.andP;  This positioningwas never part of Microsoft's announced strategy, but resulted from the factthat SQL Server required Named Pipes, a proprietary Microsoft protocol.andP;  SQLServer was positioned as a lever to force Novell to support the MicrosoftNamed Pipes.andP;  Novell gave in slowly to Microsoft's pressure, announcing NamedPipes support for OS/2 clients in mid-1989 and holding out until May 1990before announcing Named Pipes support for DOS workstations.andM;Unfortunately for Microsoft, LAN Manager flopped in its first release.andP;  Itwas almost a year late.andP;  3Com held a rollout on October 17, 1988--a good 18months after the product was announced.andP;  The first release suffered from anumber of fatal flaws.andM;First, the added services that 3Com dealers were fond of, such as Mail andInterconnect, were not delivered with 3+Open, making upgrading any of theinstalled base impossible.andP;  Second, DOS support was inadequate.andP;  Memoryconstraints on DOS workstations effectively prevented the use ofmemory-hungry application packages like dBase IV, WordPerfect, and SQLServer.andM;At a deeper technical level, LAN Manager permitted only 255 files to be opensimultaneously--a limitation of OS/2.andP;  With applications such as Word orHiggins opening up to 30 files simultaneously, networks that supposedlysupported an unlimited number of users would support only a few.andP;  Sales werevery low.andM;1989 was the year of the upgrade for LAN Manager.andP;  Microsoft and 3Comcollaborated on development and succeeded in eliminating all of the fatalflaws by halfway through 1989.andP;  3Com shipped Mail and Interconnect, solvingthe DOS support problem by allowing memory-hungry programs to run on DOSworkstations.andP;  SQL Server shipped on May 1, 1989.andP;  Still no front-end toolsexisted, however, except for the C language.andM;Or almost none; Dave Vinzant released SQL File on the day Ashton-Tate shippedSQL Server.andP;  The trouble was, SQL File was a cute little utility with noinstalled base of applications to fuel the acceptance of SQL Server.andP;  FromMay, it was to be a couple of months until Information Builders shipped PCFocus for SQL Server.andP;  That event happened in September 1989.andP;  Unfortunately,no one who used Focus seemed to need SQL Server.andM;By December, only a dozen copies had been sold.andP;  JYACC shipped JAM in thefall.andP;  A couple of other products shipped in the fall.andP;  DataWiz put outdbSQL, which permitted dBase programs to access SQL Server.andP;  Forest andamp; Treeswas circulating advanced betas of its &quot;dashboard for your business.&quot;andO;Revelation Technologies announced a beta release that never shipped.andP;  Inshort, 1989 wasn't much of a year for SQL Server front ends.andM;And where was Ashton-Tate during this time?andP;  Unfortunately, the company hadfallen into a state of distress, suffering large losses and losingexperienced developers.andM;Far from shipping the Server Edition, Ashton-Tate was unable to bring out aclean copy of dBase IV until September 1990.andM;However, we did find out something very important: SQL Server proved to be astable platform.andP;  The catch was that it took a highly competent organizationwith deep expertise in C coding to succeed.andP;  The organizations that fit thatprofile started making money.andM;Some Good NewsandM;Mike Bernstein at Midak International developed a factory-floor managementprogram and launched his business by selling a dozen $80,000 materialhandling systems based on $2,495 SQL Server.andP;  Other examples surfaced ofdevelopers writing successful custom programs.andM;Corporate developers began ordering evaluation copies.andP;  A lot was going onbehind the scenes, despite the continuing lack of easy-to-use front-end toolsthat prevented the market from growing rapidly.andM;Application programming was greatly simplified once the steep learning curveof programming the server was scaled.andP;  By coding business rules on theserver, development time was reduced.andP;  Sam gill at DataWiz (Foster City,Calif.) reported developing an entire accounting system at a rate of onemodule a month.andP;  Organizations willing to learn a new way of coding werebeginning to reap the benefits of the client-server model.andM;Things started to happen in earnest in early 1990.andP;  Microsoft convinced theworld that SQL Server was able to handle minicomputer transaction volumes byreleasing benchmarks that it supplied to developers, analysts, and the press.andM;Word started leaking about success in custom development.andP;  Finally, thefront-end tools began to arrive.andM;And that thumbnail sketch brings us more or less up to the present.andP;  Manyfront ends most popular as database managers and decision-support tools havestill not shipped.andP;  Vendors like Borland, Revelation, DataEase, Microsoft,and Lotus have been shipping products since about August 1990.andP;  Ashton-Tate'sserver edition is still in beta and unavailable.andM;Where We StandandM;The most vexing problem at present is SQL Server.andP;  For most of its younglife, SQL Server could not run on a Novell network.andM;Novell's reasoning was that if it declined to support Named Pipes, it wouldimpede the acceptance of SQL Server -- and it was right.andP;  Novell's tactic wasto create confusion.andP;  At the beginning of 1989, it announced it would developa DOS requester supporting Named Pipes.andP;  It never showed up.andP;  by late 1989,it had reversed position and announced that the project wasn't importantenough to put on the development calendar.andP;  Meanwhile, Microsoft had beeninactive, thinking all along that support from Novell was at hand.andM;By the end of 1989, SQL Server supporters were despairing that SQL Serverwould be a victim of the war between Novell and Microsoft.andP;  By early 1990,however, things began to change.andP;  Novell was getting letters from some oftheir major customers that expressed interest in SQL Server and threatened toreplace their Novell networks with LAN Manager networks unless Novell beganto support Named Pipes on dOS workstations.andM;It started to look like a change in strategy was warranted.andP;  A beta of theDOS requester began circulating in March 1990.andP;  Novell said it would releaseit in due time.andM;And What About dBase?andM;Remember the original strategy?andP;  Ashton-Tate was supposed to provide aversion of dBase IV that connected to SQL Server.andP;  The product was easy topromise and hard to deliver.andM;At the root of the problem was a fundamental incompatibility between the waySQL Server was designed and the way dBase worked.andP;  dBase data files includedthree unique fields for every record: a deleted field, a time-stamp field,and a record-number field.andP;  SQL doesn't need that information.andM;As a result, Ashton-Tate was forced into a convoluted dynamic conversionprocess that temporarily added the dBase fields to the SQL Server data files.andO;The problem is, when you do that, you lose the primary benefit of SQL Server-- multiple program access.andP;  Ashton-Tate was changing the standard to makethe system work.andP;  Other front-end vendors were outraged.andP;  The open platformwas beginning to look closed.andM;Then came the mapping problem.andP;  The original idea was that dBase IV wouldtrap dBase commands and dynamically convert them to SQL statements to talk tothe server.andP;  Successful implementation of that feature would have permittedoff-the-shelf dBase programs to run against SQL server without modification.andO;This was easier said than done.andM;First, not all dBase commands map cleanly to SQL.andP;  Second, SQL Serveroptimize SQL commands for execution.andP;  It wasn't always possible forAshton-Tate to predict the outcome of certain queries.andP;  Finally, even whensuccessful, mapping proved to be unacceptably slow.andM;The whole transparency issue began to evaporate in late 1989.andP;  By then, itbecame obvious that dBase programs would have to be rewritten to include SQLstatements for data access.andP;  There went another early selling point.andP;  Thecoup de grace for SQL Server was Ashton-Tate's collapse, starting in August1989.andP;  First the marketing department came apart.andP;  Training and technicalsupport ever really happened.andM;By early 1990, Ashton-Tate had effectively abandoned SQL Server in favor of anew database product from Interbase, a firm in which Ashton-Tate held amajority interest.andM;Now Where Do We Go?andM;Microsoft has taken back responsibility for marketing SQL Server fromAshton-Tate.andP;  At the same time, it effectively took back primary marketingresponsibility for LAN Manager from 3Com.andP;  This action represented a seachange for Microsoft, which up to now has sold only through originalequipment manufacturers.andM;Microsoft has announced it will distribute LAN Manager through resellers andretailers.andP;  Their ultimate distribution strategy will closely resembleNovell's.andM;So what are the prospects for SQL Server?andP;  Despite the disappointments, Icontinue to believe that the product is strong, and it is just a matter oftime until all the pieces are in place.andP;  Does this mean you're going to wait?andO;You'd better not.andP;  This stuff is complicated.andP;  If you wait another year toget started, you'll be hopelessly behind.andP;  Plenty of development is going on,and a sufficient suite of tools is available today.andM;SQL Server introduces a host of new issues into application development anddatabase design.andP;  The concept of server intelligence and programming theserver takes some getting used to.andP;  If you expect to be part of theclient-server revolution that will start in earnest in 1991, it's a good ideato start getting ready today.andM;Leith Anderson has been an independent systems integrator since 1981.andP;  He isco-founder of LANDA and has been a consultant to Microsoft and Ashton-Tate.andO;Presently, he is director of third party marketing at Orackle's Desk-topProducts Divison.andM;Marathon systems Streamlines DevelopmentandM;Marathon Systems is a systems integration and consulting firm based in SanFrancisco, Calif.andP;  Marathon has substantial experience in minicomputerapplication development, but had recently pioneered the use of PCs in systemsthey designed.andM;Marathon had a Fortune 100 client, a transportation company, faced with acommon dilemma in today's complex information-systems environments.andP;  Theclient had originally turned to PCs for their cost-effectiveness,flexibility, and prototyping capability, but was running into throughput,data integrity, and security limitations.andM;Marathon's business solution for this company was the Microsoft SQL Serverrunning under OS/2 on a Compaq SystemPro, along with a 3Com 3 + Open LAN.andO;Marathon developed a custom application dubbed the SQL Profitability AnalysisSystem (PAS).andP;  The system was developed to calculate the costs of10,000-to-15,000 container movements per week according to more than 3,000complex contractual arrangements with railroads and customers.andP;  PAS is amission-critical tool that provides information for financial reporting,including key performance indicators, planning, pricing, trend analysis, andhistorical reporting.andM;Prior to the implementation of the SQL PAS, the process entailed capturingoperations data via IBM mainframe transactions nationwide and downloading theaccumulated weekly information to a Paradox-based application on an IBM PC.andO;This information was then processed for more than 15 hours to calculatecontainer costs.andP;  As a result of input anomalies in the mainframe operationssystem, a minimum of eight hours of auditing and adjusting the data wasrequired.andP;  Because of the impossible processing window, the client found itdifficult to accomplish more than standard financial reporting.andO;Consequently, the system's usefulness as a strategic tool was greatlydiminished.andM;The client's manager of financial reporting was primarily interest inreceiving information on contribution analysis: &quot;Reports have to be out thedoor fast.andP;  Management needs to look at the effect of certain decisions veryquickly.&quot;andP;  Marathon Systems was credited with developing a solution thatprovided better data integrity and faster performance.andP;  The ProfitabilityAnalysis System became a new strategic tool for the company.andP;  If a trendexists in the downsizing movement, it's that companies are developing theirown new and effective management tools to help them gain a competitiveadvantage.andM;Marathon System deployed a three-person development team to build the SQLPAS.andP;  By using the Microsoft SQL Server and a multithreaded distributedarchitecture, the original estimate was that processing time would be reducedby 100 percent.andP;  Marathon project leader Bruce Nelson led a five-monthdevelopment effort that came in under budget and resulted in a final decreasein processing time of about 500 percent.andM;Doug Vaughan, vice president of Marathon Systems, was responsible for clientmanagement.andP;  His advice to firms contemplating a downsizing project is,&quot;Given the tremendous complexity of the client's operations and the criticalnature of the application, we had to rely on close coordination with theclient and develop an in-depth understanding of their business.andP;  To increasethe throughput, we capitalized on the client-server architecture utilizing Cas the primary front-end tool and the SQL Server product as our RDBMS.&quot;andP;  Twomore trends emerge: First, this development cycle is standard, with manymonths devoted to application design before coding commences.andP;  Second, thefirst and to date only universally effective front-end tool has been C.andO;Consequently, the organizations that have enjoyed predictable success havebeen able to deploy competent C programmers.andM;The combination of increased data integrity and throughput will allow theclient's personnel to rerun financial reports as needed without missingdeadlines.andP;  This enables them to perform what-if analyses and to use SQL PASas a strategic decision-making tool.andP;  The client's manager or financialreporting was particularly interested in profitability analysis.andM;One goal was to provide management with cost and contribution information onspecific lanes, container sizes, or a single train.andP;  The increased accuracyof the data was found to be important in small samples required for thisdetailed profitability analysis.andM;The best compliment is a new purchase order.andP;  Marathon's client has created alist of enhancements for PAS and identified another group fo projectssuitable for downsizing.andP;  The client-server architecture has proven to be asophisticated and cost-effective platform that fulfilled the business needsof the client: greater throughput, data security, and data integrity.andM;Midak: Protecting Data IntegrityandM;Taking a slightly different tack is Midak International of Tuscon, Ariz.andO;Midak is a systems-integration firm specializing in material handling.andP;  Itemploys SQL Server as the database manager in implementing its AutomatedStorage and Retrieval System (ASRS).andM;The Midak system combines automated carousels, bar code technology, kittingmatrices, and the Inventory Management and Control System Software (IMACS).andO;Midak has automated the stockrooms of several Fortune 500 companies.andP;  IMACSincorporates real-time communication with a host computer and carries eachpart through the system.andP;  Using SQL Server has made the transition intomodifications between different client sites easier and less costly.andP;  Thesystems engineers have been able to change stored procedures with minimaleffects on the actual program code.andM;Mike Bernstein, president of Midak, cites the most important feature of SQLServer: &quot;The transaction and rollback capabilities of SQL Server have beenexcellent.andP;  Even during test and implementation phases, data integrity hasremained excellent.&quot;andM;The Midak system is a sophisticated factory-floor-management system thatprofits from database technology at the core.andP;  The complete system, includingengineering services employed by Midak, combines advanced technologies.andP;  Thesystem uses conveyor systems, carousel systems, robotics and automation,automated storage and retrieval systems, bar code, online databasecommunications, hand-held data-collection transaction managers, and automatedguided vehicles.andM;Parts are inducted into IMACS and put away onto automated carousel or manualshelving devices.andP;  Work orders are generated for the parts and issue requestssent to individual work locations for the parts to be picked.andP;  Issued partsare sent to the kitting station for collection to manufacturing.andP;  The SQLServer platform is used throughout IMACS from the storage of the part to thefinal validation of the completed kit.andP;  Stored procedures are used during theinduction process to ensure that the part is correctly entered and allaffected tables correctly updated.andM;During the put-away process, SQL Server is used to store the location andquantity on hand for each part.andP;  IMACS allows the same part to be stored indifferent locations and SQL Server tracks the various locations of the samepart.andP;  After work orders have been manually entered into the system orretrieved from the host computer, stored procedures are used to break thework order into separate line items and find the parts.andP;  After verifying thatthe oldest parts are used first, IMACS sends the issue requests to thecorrect workstations.andP;  Whenparts are used for open work orders, IMACS usesSQL Server to update inventory balances and remove parts from the system ifnecessary.andP;  At a kitting station, stored procedures consolidate theindividual kit parts and remove the kit from the system when completed.andM;Operator efficiency and the numerous transactions are logged in SQL Server,which aids in support of the IMACS package.andP;  This information, together withdetails about both completed and pending transactions, is conveyedautomatically to the host computer using a real-time AdvancedProgram-to-Program Communications (APPC) link between SQL Server and thehost.andP;  The Midak IMACS system is an example of systems integrators utilizingdatabase-server technology to build their next generation systems on a solidfoundation.andM;Some Development ToolsandM;for Database ServersandM;Advanced RevelationandM;Advanced Revelation is a development environment offering environmentalbonding to foreign data files.andM;Revelation Technologies, 2 Park Ave., New York, N.Y.andP;
