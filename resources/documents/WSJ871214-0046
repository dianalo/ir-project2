But even before the trade report, Lawrence J. Greenberg, an economist at Chemical Bank, New York, had figured that a late-December sell-off was all but inevitable.    In fact, Mr. Greenberg has predicted a late-December dollar decline for every year since 1981. In all but one period, his predictions proved right.    The 40-year-old former Federal Reserve economist doesn't use a crystal ball. His annual year-end forecast is based on the dollar's historic trading pattern in Decembers. In 13 of the past 14 years, the dollar has fallen in value between mid-December and New Year's Day, and has failed to do so only twice since the start of the modern floating exchange system in the early 1970s.    A nine-year veteran in Chemical's foreign exchange advisory service, Mr. Greenberg normally relies exclusively on fundamental economic factors in forecasting currency trends. But six years ago, with a shortage of any major factors in the typically dull holiday season, he recalled a series of end-of-the-year declines and saw a connection.    &quot;I'm struck by the consistency of it,&quot; he says of the trend. &quot;You're not going to get that by flipping a coin.&quot; He suggests that the dollar's performance in no other two-week period would reveal such a predictable showing over so many years.    Mr. Greenberg says he's certain there's a logical explanation for the trend but so far it has eluded him. His best guess is that U.S. multinational companies with earnings overseas repatriate year-end profits into dollars in the first half of December. He thinks that is so bookkeeping can be completed to allow for vacations between Christmas and the New Year. The phenomenon creates an absence of these companies -- which traditionally are dollar buyers -- from the foreign exchange markets in the final two weeks of the year.    This theory is somewhat supported by the dollar's rise in the first two weeks of December in nine of the past 14 years. But the dollar's average rise of 0.3% in the first half of December is heavily outweighed by its average decline of 1.4% in the second half of the month over the 14-year period. Such a decline on an annualized basis would be much sharper than the dollar's plunge in 1985, 1986 and this year.    Even without a fundamental explanation for the pattern, market technicians may still find it useful.    The December trend could be interrupted this year if the Fed and other major central banks continue intervening in currency markets to support the dollar as they did last week, Mr. Greenberg warns. And in any case, even though he recently wrote a memo reminding Chemical's foreign exchange department of the trend, he notes there are risks to trying to profit on the market. &quot;Traders may be reluctant to act on it because of the thin (year-end) market. Nobody wants to open a large position around Christmas and then try and close it by the end of the year,&quot; he says.    The December theory has another use, albeit a social one. &quot;It's very difficult to find anything to talk about in the markets around Christmas,&quot; Mr. Greenberg says.    The dollar continued to weaken -- setting new lows against the West German and Japanese currencies -- as the market fell back to regroup after Thursday's frantic retreat on news that the October U.S. trade deficit grew to a record $17.63 billion.    The huge October trade deficit, which compared with a $14.08 billion gap in September, continued to cast a pall over the market Friday. According to dealers, only the threat of central bank intervention and the illiquid market before the holidays and the end of the year kept the market from pounding the dollar again on Friday.    Dealers said the poor U.S. trade performance only deepened the market's longstanding bearishness toward the U.S. currency.    However, the dollar barely moved Friday and trading was extremely slow as many dealers began curtailing operations to the bare minimum for the remainder of the year.    In late New York dealings, the dollar stood at 1.6313 West German marks, down from 1.6325 Thursday. The dollar also fell to 128.35 Japanese yen, from 129, while the British pound climbed to $1.8378, from $1.8350.    In Tokyo Friday, the dollar fell to 1.6270 marks and 128.17 yen, the lowest since 1949. Traders said the Bank of Japan intervened to buy $500 million to $600 million to support the U.S. currency.    The dollar was stable to firmer in early trading in Tokyo Monday. The currency was quoted at 128.25 yen, up from 128.20 yen at the opening.    &quot;The only news that moved the market at all (Friday) has been the continuing debate about whether the (Reagan) administration is willing to let the dollar fall further,&quot; said Daniel O'Connell, senior dealer at First National Bank of Chicago.    Mr. O'Connell said the market perked up on a report by Market News Service, a small wire service serving mainly currency and bond traders. The report quoted an unnamed &quot;senior administration official&quot; as saying U.S. policy is opposed to supporting the dollar through either intervention by the Fed or tighter credit. The report also said the U.S. is &quot;disinclined&quot; to enter any new agreement with its major trading partners that would attempt to stabilize currency rates at any given level.    Later, a White House spokesman, noting that once again such a report had come from an unnamed source, said &quot;if the comment didn't quote the president of the United States or the secretary of the Treasury, it doesn't reflect the policy.&quot;    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose $4.80 an ounce to $497.10 in heavy trading. The estimated volume was 6.8 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $497.25 an ounce in early trading Monday in Hong Kong.    ---                    Late New York Trading                    Friday, Dec. 11, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
