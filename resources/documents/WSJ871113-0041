Late in the day in New York, the dollar was up by less than 1% against most other major currencies, and many traders remained generally bearish on the U.S. currency. Traders said a firm agreement between the White House and Congress to significantly reduce the federal budget deficit must be reached soon for the dollar to avoid a sudden sell-off.    &quot;The mood is still down&quot; for the dollar, Carmine J. Rotondo, vice president, foreign exchange, at Security Pacific National Bank, New York, said. &quot;The market isn't looking at trade figures any more; it's looking at the budget,&quot; he said.    The dollar's brief rally also was fueled by encouraging reports yesterday morning about a prospective budget agreement, traders said. That was negated by later word that an agreement was unlikely for at least two more days.    Even the report on merchandise trade was viewed with restrained enthusiasm. The report showed that the U.S. trade deficit narrowed to $14.08 billion in September from $15.68 billion in August. Traders pointed that the gap was still huge, if a little less huge than many of them had expected.    The dollar's rebound after the trade news was caused by speculators buying dollars to cover short, or oversold, positions, not by any change in the overall negative market sentiment toward the dollar.    &quot;It was a weak trade number,&quot; Shigeru Tokunaga, vice president and foreign exchange manager at Fuji Bank Ltd., New York, said. &quot;I'm still bearish.&quot;    In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 1.6878 West German marks, up 0.7% from 1.6760 late Wednesday but down from a midday high of 1.6980. The dollar also climbed 0.5% to 135.84 Japanese yen from 135.10. In intraday dealings, it had traded as high as 136.55 yen.    The U.S. currency was quoted at 135.87 yen in early Tokyo trading Friday.    The dollar especially came under pressure against the yen after yesterday morning's rally as large sell orders by Japanese institutions and trading companies were triggered by the advance. Some traders said chances of the dollar sustaining another rally are slight because of additional sell orders against the yen that are still outstanding.    &quot;I know of two banks in town holding orders to sell between $200 million and $300 million, and mine is one of them,&quot; one New York trader who asked not to be identified said.    The budget talks in Washington may be the dollar's last hope of finding some stability this year, many traders say. The negotiators are trying to reach an agreement on at least $23 billion in budget cuts before next Friday, when the Gramm-Rudman law imposes across-the-board spending reductions of that amount.    But the White House officials and congressional leaders should be aiming higher than that if they hope to help the dollar, traders said.    &quot;The next step from here depends on the budget deficit. If cuts only meet the Gramm-Rudman requirements, the dollar will start going down again,&quot; Jack A. Kessler, senior vice president, foreign exchange, at Chase Manhattan Bank, New York, said.    As for the negotiators' deadline, he said, &quot;Come Monday, if there's no news on the budget, the dollar's going down.&quot;    The dollar also would react negatively to any budget plan that relies on one-time steps such as asset sales to reduce the deficit, traders said.    &quot;If there's only a one-year effect, there will be fear about the next year and the future,&quot; Mr. Tokunaga of Fuji Bank said.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose $1.60 an ounce to $463.50 in moderate trading. Estimated volume was 2.6 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $465.05 an ounce in early trading Friday in Hong Kong.    ---                     Late New York Trading                    Thursday, Nov. 12, 1987    Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
