The banks -- Deer Lodge Bank andamp; Trust Co., Deer Lodge, Mont.; Southwestern Bank, Houston; First National Bank of Braman, Braman, Okla., and Commonwealth Bank, Glendale, Colo. -- are to reopen today as units of other institutions.    The only office of Deer Lodge, closed by state banking authorities, is to reopen as Peoples Bank of Deer Lodge, a newly chartered subsidiary of Sandquist Corp., Bozeman, Mont.    The failed bank had assets of $14.8 million and held deposits of $13.6 million in 3,800 accounts. It was the second bank to fail in Montana this year.    The main office of Southwestern, closed by the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency, is to reopen as a branch of Omnibanc North Belt, also of Houston. The failed bank had assets of $14.8 million and held $14.3 million in 800 deposit accounts. A drive-in office of Southwestern won't reopen, the FDIC said. All depositors of the failed bank will automatically become depositors of Omnibanc.    Southwestern was the 18th bank to fail in Texas this year.    The sole office of First National, closed by the Comptroller, is to reopen as a branch of Community Bank, Shidler, Okla. First National had assets of $12.3 million and held deposits of $11.9 million in 1,800 accounts. It was the 13th Oklahoma bank to fail this year.    Commonwealth's sole office, closed by state banking authorities, is to reopen as a detached facility of Prudential Bank, Denver. Colorado law doesn't allow banks to operate branches.    Commonwealth, which had assets of $6.2 million and held $5.9 million in 1,200 deposit accounts, was the fourth bank to fail this year in Colorado. </TEXT></DOC>
