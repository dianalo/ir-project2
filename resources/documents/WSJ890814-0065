Mr. Lucas was named by Attorney General Dick Thornburgh to head a low-profile Justice Department office that coordinates relations with state and local groups and civil rights organizations. Mr. Lucas, a black politician, left the Democratic party to join the GOP and was defeated in his 1986 campaign for the Michigan governorship.    The Senate Judiciary Committee, on a 7-7 vote, last month effectively killed Mr. Lucas's nomination to head the department's civil rights division. A majority was needed to send the nomination to the full Senate. Democratic members of the committee criticized President Bush and Mr. Thornburgh for nominating Mr. Lucas, who has little experience as a lawyer and none as a civil rights litigator.    The appointment to the Justice Department liaison job ends consideration within the Bush administration of appointing Mr. Lucas to the civil rights post on an interim basis while Congress is on its summer recess. </TEXT></DOC>
