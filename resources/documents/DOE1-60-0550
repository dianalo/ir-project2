<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-60-0550 </DOCNO><TEXT>The 4{pi} Detector Working Group tried to address two major questions:1. Can general 4{pi} detectors be built for the SSC that will be ableto study rare processes at center-of-mass energies of 40 TeV and at luminositiesof 10/sup 33/ cm/sup -2/sec/sup -1/? 2. What are realistic cost estimatesfor such detectors? To try to answer these questions, the group splitinto three subgroups, each of which worked fairly independently to designa detector. The general conclusions of these studies were that thesetypes of detectors could be built, would be able to do physics underthese conditions, and would each cost between 200 and 300 million dollars.</TEXT></DOC>
