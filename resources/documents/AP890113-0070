The stronger dollar depressed gold prices slightly.   Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar surged in Asian dealingsand continued to rise in Europe in response to Stoltenberg saying hewould like to see the dollar remain at around 1.80 West German marks.   Dealers in Frankfurt and Milan said the market's rally was beingcurbed by fears of central bank intervention.   A trader with the Milan branch of a major U.S. commercial bankexpressed surprise at the strength of the dollar's rally so far thisyear, spurred mainly by high U.S. interest rates.   ``Let's not forget that the dollar has risen without the benefitof a long-expected hike in the U.S. discount rate,'' she said. Thediscount rate is the interest rate charged by the Federal Reserve onloans to commercial banks.   But another trader in Milan said the primary motive behind thedollar's rally is speculation.   ``The U.S. still has a big trade deficit and says it wants alower dollar. The west Germans have a huge trade surplus and want astronger mark. But the dollar surges and the mark falls,'' he said.   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,the dollar rose 0.53 yen to a closing 126.65 yen. Later, in London,it was quoted higher at 126.75 yen.
