The movement overseas is part of a continuing shift inemphasis that comes in the face of declining U.S. oil outputand expectations of &quot;increased reliance on imports,&quot; saidVictor A. Burk, managing director of the oil practice atArthur Andersen, an accounting firm.</LP><TEXT>   In 1989, exploration and development spending by the 236public companies in the survey rose 7% to $39.2 billion, thethird consecutive annual increase. A 20% rise in foreignspending last year to $21.9 billion primarily accounted forthe overall rise in expenditures, Arthur Andersen said.   Exploration overseas is done mostly by major companies,but smaller ones are beginning to participate, too.Generally, companies say, geology outside the U.S. favors thepotential for big discoveries, and tax treatment and otherinducements also can be more favorable.   Arthur Andersen compiled 1989 data from Securities andExchange Commission filings from oil companies with more thanone million barrels of reserves. The vast majority of thecompanies are based in the U.S., and a few are foreign buthave large U.S. reserves, such as British Petroleum Co., orare Canadian.   A decline of more than $8 a barrel in crude oil pricesthis year and depressed natural gas prices won't slow theexploration spending increases, Mr. Burk said, viewing themas temporary. &quot;Managements of most companies look at thingson a long-term basis,&quot; he said. &quot;They look at things three tofive to 10 years ahead, and not what they see now.&quot;   Many oil industry officials believe that world oil demandwill continue to grow and that production in many countrieswill shrink, boosting prices in this decade. Arthur Andersenestimated that U.S. oil production, for example, will drop by400,000 barrels a day this year and by one million barrels aday by 1995. Just since 1986, domestic output has fallen 17%,or 1.8 million barrels a day.   While production declines, U.S. demand will rise 1% ayear, or about one million barrels a day between now and1995, the accounting firm predicted. Demand is growing morerapidly elsewhere. Mr. Burk said that Japanese oil demand isexpanding about 4% annually, and that in developing countriessuch as South Korea, Thailand, Malaysia and Taiwan, growthexceeds 6% a year.   Mr. Burk said it is unclear what effect energy demand inEastern Europe may have on world oil markets in coming years,though many specialists predict more growth if the economiesin that region expand. Oil production from the Soviet Unionfell about 300,000 to 400,000 barrels a day last year and asimilar decline is expected this year.   But Mr. Burk said he doesn't expect another oil crisis.&quot;We are not in the same situation we were in in the 1970s,&quot;he said. This time, the oil producing countries, mostly inthe Middle East, &quot;are looking for security of demand, just aswe are looking for security of supply,&quot; he said.   The shift overseas by the largest companies has providedopportunities for smaller ones in the U.S., and domesticdrilling activity is rising. &quot;The environment we are in todayis the best environment we have seen for independents in fouror five years,&quot; Mr. Burk said.   These smaller companies have been acquiring reserves andacreage from major oil companies and have been able to usetechnological advances and their already lower operatingcosts to find new oil and gas opportunities, he said.   The survey found that for the second consecutive year, theindustry increased its U.S. natural gas reserves, which rose6% in 1989. This reflects increased gas drilling &quot;based onexpectations gas prices will improve as demand increases incoming years,&quot; Arthur Andersen said. U.S. gas output rose 4%in 1989 to the highest level in five years, the survey found.</TEXT></DOC>
