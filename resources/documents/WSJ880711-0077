That consensus was clear even after two events last week that eliminated 500,000 barrels of daily crude production from the market: the fiery destruction of a North Sea oil platform and terrorist attacks in the oil fields of Colombia. According to traders, analysts and executives, last week's events provided only a temporary reprieve from the consequences of OPEC overproduction.    &quot;Production of 300,000 barrels a day isn't trivial,&quot; said William Randol, analyst for First Boston Corp., referring to the lost output from the North Sea. &quot;But it doesn't let OPEC off the hook.&quot;    Analysts estimate that OPEC may be pumping as much as 18.8 million barrels daily, 800,000 barrels above its unofficial 18 million-barrel-a-day ceiling. OPEC's official ceiling is 15.06 million barrels daily. But that doesn't take into account Iraq's production as well as a certain amount of cheating that always takes place.    Iraq, which has refused for more than a year to comply with any quota requirements, has been pumping 2.6 million barrels of oil daily. And the United Arab Emirates is expected this month to fulfill its threat to pump 300,000 barrels more than its 1.3 million barrel-a-day quota allows. &quot;Now there are two loose cannons,&quot; Mr. Randol said.    Oil prices retreated Friday, only one day after the frenzied rally sparked by the North Sea tragedy. West Texas Intermediate crude oil for delivery in August finished trading on the futures market at $15.46 a barrel, down 37 cents from Thursday.    One trader noted that the West Texas crude price could slip further. Dubai crude, an oil produced in the Middle East, traded Friday at $12.40 a barrel. West Texas crude typically trades for only $1.50-$2 a barrel more than Dubai, the trader said.    Most analysts and traders say that last week's North Sea tragedy could prevent the price of West Texas crude, considered the U.S. benchmark crude, from tumbling below $15 a barrel this week. But they see few factors strong enough to bolster crude oil prices.    Gasoline prices, which have remained strong despite weakness in the crude oil market, have helped to keep crude prices from falling more sharply. &quot;But it's just not enough to override all the other negative factors,&quot; said Michael Rothman, senior energy analyst for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. Mr. Rothman expects the price for West Texas crude to vacillate between $15 and $16 a barrel during the next few weeks.    A report that Subroto, the newly appointed secretary-general of OPEC, and Rilwanu Lukman, the organization's president, may get together today in Vienna is viewed by some market participants as nothing more than a courtesy meeting -- an opportunity for the two officials to chat. And traders yawned at rumors that OPEC might call an emergency meeting in response to the recent slide in crude prices.    &quot;A meeting would actually be a bearish development,&quot; said Jayne Ball, an assistant vice president of international energy futures for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. &quot;OPEC doesn't have many rabbits in its hat anymore.&quot;    Looking ahead to U.S. commodities this week:   Livestock and Meats   Reports of drought damage to feed corn, as well as a government report tomorrow on pasture conditions, are expected to dominate cattle and hog futures prices this week.    The cost of feeding livestock could surge if hot, dry conditions in the corn-growing states this week disrupt the crop's ability to pollinate and thus produce kernels.    Since the spring, the damage already done to the corn crop by the drought has pushed up feed-corn costs in some areas by 68%. As a result, farmers are scrapping plans to expand their herds, and the prices of young animals have plunged. The price of young pigs weighing 40 pounds to 50 pounds, for example, has dropped by more than half since early April.    Some traders expect the prices of full-grown hogs to erode through the summer as rising feed costs prompt farmers to cull their herds, filling slaughter houses and then supermarkets with pork.    Thomas Morgan, president of Sterling Research Corp., Arlington Heights, Ill., said the cash price of hogs fat enough for slaughter could fall about 17% from current levels by late summer.    Traders will watch to see whether cattle prices can continue last week's rebound from a price plunge that started in late May. Prices rallied amid reports that meatpackers and grocers had let their beef inventories dwindle so low -- apparently in anticipation of even cheaper prices -- that they would need to increase their purchases.    Tomorrow, the Agriculture Department is slated to make its first projection of drought damage to the nation's spring-planted crops. Among other things, the report is expected to show that the nation's grazing lands are in the worst condition in at least 50 years.    Interest Rates   Friday's release of higher-than-expected employment figures for June sent Treasury bond futures prices into a spin, and the employment figures are expected to continue to weigh on the market this week, analysts said.    &quot;People will be comparing the employment numbers to other figures coming out this month to see if the new data back up&quot; the picture of a robust economy, said Frederick Leiner, a futures analyst with Continental Illinois National Bank in Chicago.    &quot;More people are leaning toward expecting a discount rate hike&quot; by the Federal Reserve Board aimed at cooling inflationary pressures on the economy, said Jeffrey Priest, head of fixed income trading with Miller Tabak Hirsch andamp; Co. in New York.    He added, however, that there was &quot;tons of liquidity&quot; in the market Friday as prices bounced off their intraday lows.    &quot;The Japanese brokerage firms are saying that bonds look good and that inflation won't be a problem,&quot; Mr. Priest said. Japanese institutional investors are major holders of U.S. Treasury bonds and are expected to add to their dollar-denominated assets in coming months, analysts said.    Precious Metals   Precious metals have begun to be influenced less by the stronger dollar and more by inflation concerns, analysts say.    Bruce Kaplan, senior vice president at A-Mark Precious Metals Inc., a Santa Monica, Calif., wholesaler, said that precious metals, which acted &quot;brain dead&quot; after an Iranian plane was shot down by the U.S. in the Persian Gulf, now are drifting upward on increased inflation fears and are &quot;beginning to fulfill their traditional role as inflation hedges.&quot;    Strong demand for gold from the jewelry industry developed when the price was below $440 an ounce, but when it rose again to that level the demand abated and buyers seemed to have satisfied their needs, he said.    &quot;Prices are trying to find a level, partly influenced by inflation,&quot; according to Sharon Ziemian, assistant vice president of Citibank, N.Y. &quot;But stronger fundamentals are playing a part, too.&quot;    Still, traders apparently have only the short-term in mind, she said. After actively buying gold recently when it dipped to around $435 an ounce, traders took profits when it recovered to about $440, Ms. Ziemian said.    &quot;The lack of volatility that is keeping gold prices in a narrow range isn't encouraging traders to stay with rallies,&quot; she said.    The one precious metal that seems to be coming to life is silver, she added. &quot;It's low price is attractive, creating room to the upside and reducing downside risk,&quot; Ms. Ziemian said. &quot;Gold is currently priced about 63 times that of silver, considerably above the 47 to 49 times that's accepted as a proper spread between the metals.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
