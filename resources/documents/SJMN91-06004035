But I didn't know what I was doing.&quot;  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  PRINCESS JUDITHALTHOUGH HER NOVELS GENERATEMORE STEAM THAN RESPECT,KRANTZ IS SITTING PRETTY  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  (box) Mark Johnson reviews 'Dazzle' in Sunday's Arts andamp; Books.  </MEMO><TEXT>     Now as she's reveling in the release of her sixth book, &quot;Dazzle,&quot; anotherin the sex-and-glamour sagas that have made her famous, the acclaimed queen ofescapist pop literature recalls her first overnight success as fondly as afirst love affair.;    She still wears the golden cuff bracelet from herhusband, producer Steve Krantz, to commemorate the &quot;Scruples&quot; publication. Itreminds her of that star burst of fame and fortune that sent her into orbit asa best-selling author.;    And she, who has since sold books and miniseriesfor millions, still savors the memory of her first $50,000 advance.;   &quot;Scruples&quot; was published two days after her 50th birthday and, for this formerfree-lance magazine writer and Beverly Hills wife and mother, a new life hadbegun.;    When she hit the best-seller list, she ran out and impulsivelybought a pair of diamond earrings. &quot;I took refuge in the one thing I was sureof -- shopping. . . . It had never occurred to me there was money in this,&quot;she says of her book writing.;    And it had never occurred to her that shecould make a major purchase without her husband's approval. &quot;It's one of thebasic things most women can't do -- they can't write a big check withoutasking their husbands. It's very satisfying for a woman of my generation towrite a check without asking anyone.&quot;;    But there was life after &quot;Scruples,&quot;and Krantz, fearful of being swallowed by fame's dizzying whirl, retreated toher typewriter.;    &quot;I started another book so I had a feeling of beinggrounded,&quot; she says. &quot;I started 'Princess Daisy' as soon as possible. Itreturned me to a routine of working.&quot;;    She was still uncertain that successwould last.;    &quot;I never took for granted that I would write a second book andI never envisioned that one day you and I would be sitting here and I wouldhave written six books,&quot; she says.;    Words worth millions;  Her second bookmade publishing history. Paperback rights were auctioned for $3.2 million,then the highest price ever for reprint rights.;    Krantz was a millionairein her own right. She had a following. Her subsequent books, &quot;Mistral'sDaughter,&quot; &quot;I'll Take Manhattan&quot; and &quot;Till We Meet Again,&quot; were scooped up byfaithful readers and by television.;    But there was a downside to Krantz'success; the critics snubbed her.;    &quot;I took criticism in the press assomeone snatching money out of the mouths of more deserving writers,&quot; sherecalls. &quot;They didn't understand that if publishers make money on best sellersthey can afford to work with other authors. They had profits from my booksthat they could put into risk taking.&quot;;    Short of serious;  This onetimeWellesley College English major knows she is not writing serious literature.;   &quot;I think I write about things that are serious in the lives of my charactersbut not in a serious way. My style is not a serious style. It's a playfulstyle,&quot; she says.;    Sex is a key ingredient in Krantz's books, and &quot;Dazzle&quot;contains more explicit sex scenes than ever, including a lesbian episode.;   Why does she focus so heavily on sex?;    &quot;I like to write about it,&quot; she saysmatter-of-factly. &quot;I love to write erotic, sensuous scenes. I found I had atalent for writing about sex and I like to exercise that talent. Besides, Idon't feel I know my characters in a completely rounded way unless I knowabout their sex lives. It's like the color of their hair.&quot;;    Doing thelegwork;  Krantz prides herself on research for each book. She explored theBeverly Hills boutique business in &quot;Scruples,&quot; the world of advertisingagencies in &quot;Princess Daisy,&quot; Nazi collaborators in &quot;Mistral's Daughter&quot; andWorld War II flying aces in &quot;Till We Meet Again.&quot;;    The heroine of &quot;Dazzle&quot;is a beautiful (natch) photographer of celebrities who also is heir to anOrange County Spanish land grant threatened by development. That subject is ascarefully delineated as her characters' wardrobes and sexual appetites.;   &quot;You can't keep a novel going on just sex and clothes,&quot; says Krantz. &quot;Nobodywould read it. You've got to have real characters and real problems.&quot;;   Krantz -- who is starting a new book -- says she writes for love, not money.And certainly not for posterity.;    &quot;If I were writing for posterity, as anEnglish major I would have to laugh at myself,&quot; she says. &quot;I don't think I'llcome back in another life and see kids reading my books in high school.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  LINDA DEUTSCH, Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Los Angeles  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910104  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  860  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday January 4, 199100004035,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
