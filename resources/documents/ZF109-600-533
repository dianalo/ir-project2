(many new or upgraded computer pagecomposition and publishing systems were displayed at the Oct 3-5,90, Seybold Computer Publishing Conference and Exposition in SanJose, CA, at at the previous Graph Expo; composition softwarepackages from 16 firms are described)andM;</TITLE><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Desktop PublishingSoftware PackagesTrade ShowsConferences and MeetingsProduct IntroductionSoftware PublishersLayout.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Composition Systems We had anticipated using these events to take the pulseof the commercial composition market, focusing in particular on the newhardware and operating systems that have been completed recently or havenearly completed development.andP;  We were interested in how some products forSun Microsystems workstations are shaping up (Miles 33, Quadex and Krohm),whether Penta's new Aviion workstation will bring that company back into theforefront of the commercial market, how the Windows-vs.-OS/2 showdown isfaring (Magna, Bestinfo, Atex, Archetype, Ultimate, etc.), and how theMacintosh is doing as a commercial composition workstation (Bedford andInterset).andM;Many of those questions were left unanswered as some of the anticipatedproducts didn't appear.andP;  Agfa didn't bring its Quadex system to either of theshows.andP;  Miles 33 canceled its planned attendance.andP;  Krohm showed no more thanwe had seen at ANPA last June.andP;  Penta said its Aviion development wasundergoing some last-minute design changes, so it kept it at home.andP;  Ultimate,which had demostrated a very early version of its OS/2 composition system atthe quadrennial Drupa show, figured it was still too far from ready to bringto an annual event.andM;But we did find some interesting things to look at.andP;  Interset has progressedconsiderably in its Macintosh product, although some key features remain tobe implemented before a scheduled November release in the UK--and with nofirm plans for sales in the U.S.andP;  Bedford continues to enhance itsall-platforms ProType system, including support for Japanese.andP;  Alphatype saysit finally is ready for the rejuvenation that has been so slow in coming,although its recent focus has been on the output side rather than on thefront end.andM;Bestinfo has overhauled its user interface and its Page-Wright editingfacilities--finally--under OS/2, although isn't clear yet how many customerswill be willing to pay to equip their workstations appropriately to takeadvantage of it.andM;Not one of the traditional players in the commercial composition market, IBMintroduced an impressive version of its BookManager software for a variety ofIBM platforms.andP;  The thrust of version 1.2 is on facilitating access todocuments on a computer screen, rather than on hard-copy output.andM;In the magazine and newspaper markets, several vendors displayed progress.andO;Compatible Systems Engineering continues its upward climb with softwareupdates and new sales.andP;  Atex showed its move to the IBM RS/6000 as a fileserver for its PC Page Makeup system and offered a glimpse of some OS/2developments.andP;  Archetype dropped a bomb with its price reduction to $995 fora professional product--although it isn't clear yet that it will reach thesales volume needed for retail products.andM;Among corporate publishing systems, Interleaf took the honors with itsunveiling of Interleaf 5, which we discussed in detail in our last issue.andO;But Frame was there, too, as was a new competitor, Elan Computer Group, withits Avalon Publisher, to be covered in the Seybold Report on DesktopPublishing.andP;  Intergraph is focusing more on color than on its text system, sowe are covering its news elsewhere.andM;Alphatype shows new directionsandM;After years of dedicating itself to serving a small portion of the textcomposition market, Alphatype is looking to shed that image and join themainstream.andP;  It isn't abandoning the quality-conscious typographers that havekept it in business for more than three decades, but it knows it can'tsurvive by catering only to that dwindling market.andP;  So, its new effort willgo beyond its traditional quality handamp;j and 5,300-dpi CRT typesetter to embracethe realities of the current market.andP;  It is providing new features to enhancePostScript output, including a network RIP and some laser imaging devicesobtained through OEM deals with other manufacturers.andM;The new products go hand in hand with the company's existing systems, butAlphatype will attempt to sell them also to customers with Macintosh or PCsystems running off-the-shelf software.andM;PostScript support.andP;  Alphatype has been in the process of getting into thePostScript business for years.andP;  In fact, if it had fulfilled its initialschedule for delivering a PostScript typestter, it would have been the firstcompany after Linotype to compete in that market.andP;  But it suffered so manydelays and problems that people started to wonder if its product ever wouldreach the market.andP;  One key to breaking the logjam was switching interpreters(abandoning Pipeline in favor of Custom Applications), which resulted in theproduct that is finally ready.andM;The latest developments include a background typesetting capability thatfrees the workstation to go on to another job, the use Alphatype fonts bothfor PostScript output and for screen display, the ability to mix PostScriptand Alphatype formats within an Alphatype job, and a NetRIP that functions asa print server and as a PostScript RIP.andM;NetRIP.andP;  The NetRIP is a combination of a print server and a PostScriptraster image processor, running in a 25-MHz '386 PC that resides on any ofthe Alphatype networks--the AlphaNet, the MiniNet or the Expanded MiniNet.andO;It monitors the output process, creates low-resolution view files to displaygraphics on workstations on the network, and rasterizes the data for outputto an imaging engine on the network, using multiple queues to supportmultiple recorders.andP;  Among its features is the ability to mix Alphatype andPostScript data on the smae page.andM;The NetRIP can be used with systems running Alphatype composition software orwith off-the-shelf packages running in PCs or Macintoshes on the network.andM;Systems.andP;  As we reported previously, Alphatype offers its full Netware-basedsystem and two smaller versions: the MiniNet, which supports up to fiveworkstations (Macs or PCs) and four output devices, and the Expanded MiniNet,which accommodates nine workstations.andP;  They all import TIFF or PostScriptgraphics, to which text can be added by specifying x/y coordinate locationsfor placement.andP;  Graphics can be scaled on input by specifying the percentageto be applied.andP;  With Workstation IV, which includes a WYSIWYG preview,graphics can be viewed prior to output.andM;All systems support both Alphatype and Adobe fonts, proof output on a laserprinter, and background rasterizing with a PC dedicated to the task on thenetwork.andM;Pricing.andP;  A basic AlphaComposer that supports only the Alphatype commandlanguage (using the AlphaRip) costs $28,000, including a '386 PC with a 50-MBdisk and the Workstation III software.andP;  With a Workstation IV, the price is$36,000.andP;  Substituting a 300-MB disk for the 50-MB one adds $4,000 to eithersystem.andM;A PostScript AlphaComposer with a '386 PC, 300-MB disk and AlphaRip costs$41,000 or, with Workstation IV software, $49,000.andP;  Alternatively, a systemwith NetRIP functionality would cost $16,300 for NetRIP, $11,900 for MiniNetsoftware and network connectors, and $28,000 for the AlphaComposer, or$56,200 for a machine handling both PostScript and Alphatype languages withthe NetRIP.andM;High-resolution output devices are priced as follows: CRS 99000, $69,700; PSComposer, $28,000-$42,000; and LS1450 (the Bidco FrontPage 80CH), $65,000.andO;Pricing of the ECRM PelBox 3000 hasn't been announced.andM;New sales.andP;  Alphatype had some new sales to back up its claim that it hasturned the corner and begun to look healthy after a period in which manypeople thought the company wouldn't survive.andP;  New sales include:andM;* Typografen 2 (Stockholm)--3 CRS 99000s (two upgrades), an Alphanet systemwith mirrored disk drives, and 5 Worstations IV PCs.andM;* Everts Alfabet (Copenhagen)--1 CRS 99000, AlphaNet, NetRIP, a scanner andfour Workstation IV PCs.andM;* Studio Fox (Brussels)--1 AlphaComposer PS with a Workstation IV.andM;* Boro Typographers--1 CRS 99000, AlphaNet with mirrored disks and 300-MBdisk drives.andP;  NetRIP, and 5 Workstation III and 2 Workstation IV Pcs.andM;* Master Typographers (Chicago)--2 CRS 99000s (upgraded from 9900s) and ascanner.andM;* City Type (San Francisco)--1 CRS 99000 (upgraded), AlphaNet with mirroreddrives, NetRIP, scanner and 1 Workstation IV.andM;* Word Management (Albany, NY)--Expanded MiniNet, NetRIP, CRS 99000 and aWorkstation IV '386 PC with 50-MB disk.andM;Alphatype said these orders have a total value of more than $1.1 million.andO;Some were sold by distributors, which Alphatype now has in Greece, England,Italy and FRance.andP;  Some new sales personnel also are being hired.andM;Archetype positioned for retail salesandM;The Seybold event was significant for Archetype not for new products orfeatures, but for a repositioning of the company.andP;  Essentially, Archetype isviewing itself as a high-end ad and page makeup company selling a retailproduct.andP;  Until now, Archetype's Designer has been sold and supportedprimarily via OEMs and distributors--system people capable of handling thehigher complexity and added features of Designer.andP;  But now the product isgoing retail.andP;  Its price has been dropped from $2,500 to only $995.andM;But to become a true retail product, Designer had to become easier to installand learn.andP;  Archetype, with the aid of Windows 3.0, has overcome much of itscomplexity of the past.andP;  There are no more DOS extenders to get in the way.andO;(Goodbye to '386 to the Max.)andP;  The program now runs with less memory--needingabout 2 MB for basic applications rather than 4, although 4 MB still will beneeded for use with other applications, such as Corel Draw.andP;  It can also runin a '286 PC (but we recommend a 20-MHz '386).andM;The documentation is now desktop oriented--both in content and in itsslimmed-down size.andP;  It will fit on a bookshelf with the rest of the desktopmanuals.andM;Product enhancements.andP;  A few enhancements have been made to the programitself, including the addition of prebuilt graphic components (complexborders and coupons), streamlined menus, an improve font editor, rotation ofany elements, and a Bezier drawing tool.andP;  The program comes with the standard35 PostScript fonts, with others available in packages for the screen andoutput.andM;Atex goes to Windows 3, IBM RS/6000andM;Atex used the Seybold Conference to introduce a new version of PC PageMakeup, the production component of the Atex Workgroup Publishing System,running within Windows 3.0 with an IBM RS/6000 file server.andP;  It also showedsome OS/2 developments in a &quot;technology demonstration&quot; in the booth.andM;The new version of PC Page Makeup, called release 2.0, adds the speed, userinterface and memory management benefits of Windows 3.0 that other vendorsalso are finding.andP;  In addition, Atex said it has gained significant speedadvantages by using the RS/6000 as a file server for the Workgroup PublishingSystem.andP;  In the past, the system has been shown with Sun Microsystemsservers.andP;  The RS/6000 has become its standard server.andM;PC Page Makeup was demonstrated with the IBM Image Adapter/A 8-bit colormonitor at a 1,280 X 1,024-pixel resolution, and with the RasterOps 1024MC,the first 24-bit color board for the PS/2.andP;  Configured with a Sony Trinitron2 tube, it was attractive--at a price of between $5,000 and $6,000, Atexsaid, including extra memory.andP;  (The board also supports a similar-sizedmonochrome display of 1,600 X 1,200 pixels with 16 gray levels.)andM;Some of the features recently added to PC Page Makeup reflect the fact thatAtex is no longer selling its Macintosh-based Design Software as part of thissystem as a result of the company's alliance with IBM.andP;  Atex has decided tomove a lot of the design functionality into the Page Makeup workstation.andM;A key new feature for the PC system is rotation of text or graphic elementsin 1/100[degrees] increments visually or by specifying a value in a dialogbox.andP;  A nice twist to it is the ability to specify the axis of rotation fromthe four corners, the center or the midpoints of any sides of the frame, or,by typing the value, to specify anywhere else on the page as the axis forrotation.andM;For drawing, the system supports creation of starbursts and polygons that canproduce different effects by going back over existing lines.andP;  Colors can beassigned based on RGB or CMYK values, which are selected with slider bars orby typing values.andM;There is a provision for &quot;learning&quot; to create an object as the first one iscreated, with or without its x/y coordinate position, so additional objectscan be created in similar fashion later.andM;Also new are the ability to flow text automatically around circles orellipses, the greeking of text below a specified size (with actual linelengths displayed), and support for the OPI output standard.andM;Atex has added some alignment features, including a T-square to which twoobjects can be aligned, a preview of a graphic made visible by selecting afile name from a directory, the ability to spread multiple boxesproportionally across a specified width, and a feature for spreading textlines proportionally by changing either the point size or just the set size.andM;We asked how Atex had decided to implement locking of stories when more thanone story appeared on a page.andP;  We were told that when a text file is openedon the editorial network, that text file is locked to other users, but thepage itself still can be opened by a layout operator, although the oepn textfile will be locked to the layout editor.andP;  However, if a page is opened at alayout station without any files open on editorial stations, all files onthat page, including any portions of those files that jump to later pages,will be locked to all editors.andM;For applications involving tight deadlines and a lot of stories on a page,this system could result in bottlenecks as the layout editor adjusts thedepths of a few stories to make them fit, thus preventing editors fromaccessing any of the files to make minor corrections.andP;  We would like to haveboth types of users able to access the page, although, obviously, it wouldn'tbe possible to handamp;j against the layout of a story while the layout is beingchanged.andP;  It is this type of sophistication that eventually may help separateprofessional software from desk-to-level programs.andM;Technology demonstration.andP;  Atex is conducting ongoing laboratory work with anOS/2, version 1.2, PC Page Makeup product.andP;  It demonstrated some of thethings being done and reported some other ideas being considered to takeadvantage of OS/2's added sophistication.andP;  It will add background printingand pagination, use separate tasks for recomposing a file and repainting thescreen, and possibly change the basic user interface to incorporate the tagsinto a toolbox.andM;The other aspect of the technology demonstration was a new system forpublication management, using the database features of the OS/2 ExtendedEdition.andP;  It provides facilities for monitoring the system throughout theproduction cycle, making it easy to find out exactly where everything standsas deadlines approach.andP;  The status is updated dynamically.andM;One key is that every object has built into it knowledge of where it issupposed to be next, so when it finishes one phase of the operation, it movesautomatically to the next, with or without requiring someone to sign off asit moves.andP;  As elements move, notes or other objects can be attached to them.andO;Each object also has a history that can be reviewed at any time.andM;Atex is interested in cooperating with other vendors in implementing thistracking facility with a variety of other products.andP;  Beta testing isscheduled for the first half of 1991.andM;Bedford shows network, Kanji, catalogsandM;Bedford demonstrated new facilities for producing Japanese Kanji type,software for paginating catalogs, support for A/UX 2.0 on the Macintosh andthe beginning of color.andP;  The booth featured an impressive network linkingSun, PC and Macintosh workstations, all running Bedford's ProType softwareunder Unix, and all able to share files.andM;Kanji.andP;  The new Kanji program is actually a PostScript version of an earlierBedford editor for Japanese that was developed with PDI to drive Lasecomptypesetters.andP;  The new program, which will be sold through PDI in Tokyo aswell as directly by Bedford from its home office in New Hampshire, has thesame functionality as the English program except that it won't supportgraphics until next June.andP;  And it currently runs only on Sun workstations,not on Macs and PCs.andM;A total of 7,680 characters can be accessed, of which 3,300 are selected froma graphics tablet and the rest are picked from 44 screen menus.andP;  Selectionsmade from the tablet can be stored as formats and called again later.andP;  Inputalso can come from the Ichitaro Japanese word processor.andM;Characters can be sized in increments of 1/1,000 of an inch.andP;  Some nicespecial effects can be created, including drop shadows with fill patterns,with control over the position of the shadow.andM;Text can be composed in horizontal and vertical orientations.andP;  Frames can belinked to cause text to flow from one area to another.andM;The Kanji program requires a Sun-3 workstation with 8 MB of memory, theSunView window environment, a 19&quot; monochrome display and streaming tape.andP;  Itdrives PostScript printers and imagesetters.andM;Catalogs.andP;  Bedford demonstrated software for paginating catalogs, includingnice facilities for performing calculations on the items in the database usedto produce pages.andP;  For example, if the catalog says that all items in asection are on sale at 20 to 40 percent off, the program will check theregular price, calculate the percentage sale price and compare it to theclaim.andP;  If the claimed reductions are incorrect, the program will adjust themautomatically.andM;The system generates a table of items, including, for the example above, eachone's name, number, regular price and sale price.andP;  When there are changes inthe data, the table can be viewed on the screen--separate from the page--withchanged items emboldened.andP;  The table can be edited and printed.andM;Color.andP;  Also in the booth was a beta version of a color editor that enablesadding spot color to text or other elements.andP;  To color text, the operatorembeds a &quot;start color&quot; code or selects a block and assigns a color to it.andO;Currently only a few colors are available, but later Bedford will support acolor wheel for picking colors.andM;Colors can be displayed on a color monitor and output as separate layers, onecolor per layer.andM;A/UX 2.0.andP;  With the advent of A/UX 2.0 for the Macintosh, Bedford gains suchbenefits as being able to read or copy files from other applications(PageMaker, FreeHand, etc.) into Bedford documents running concurrently inseparate windows.andP;  Other new features include a paint bucket tool for tintingobjects, the ability to duplicate areas (step and repeat) with the copyoffset by a specified amount from the original, additional keyboardshortcuts, and cleaner, more efficient menus.andM;Bestinfo launches Wave4 for OS/2andM;Bestinfo had been talking about it for a year and showed an early version atthe Seybold Seminars last March, but it wasn't until September that an OS/2version of Wave4 was formally launched.andP;  So the Seybold Exposition marked thefirst public showing since the launch.andM;The new program addresses many of the weaknesses of the previous version byproviding a reasonable editing program within PageWright, better use of thejob ticket, easier access to file management facilities, more flexible (andintuitive) organization of elements on a page, and, of course, a morestandard user interface under the umbrella of Presentation Manager.andM;It also adds some nice features to the color and graphics capabilities,including masking, trapping and assignment of colors.andM;The new PageWright/2 is upwardly fiel compatible with the existingPageWright.andP;  That is, files created in the older program can be read by thenew one, but not the other way around.andP;  It also is compatible with the MS-DOSversion of WordWright, which means that existing users don't have to upgradeediting stations to OS/2 to be able to use the OS/2 version ofPageWright--the page makeup portion of the program.andM;Management.andP;  In the area of management, Bestinfo has brought some of the filemaintenance tasks into PageWright, rather than requiring the user to exit theprogram to archive files, move or copy galleys, or move sections.andP;  There arenow three job tickets--one each for text, page and picture elements--that canbe linked to a database to improve tracking of elements through production.andO;We haven't had a chance to experiment with this, so we won't comment furtheron it.andP;  It is now possible also to change the fields within the job ticket.andM;User interface.andP;  Icons have replaced menus for creating tags (text elementsoutside of the main article), windows, rules, boxes, etc.andP;  Menus are used forsome file management functions.andM;The entire help system has been overhauled, providing context-sensitive helpaccessed in a hypertext fashion.andP;  After selecting one help item, to getadditional help on an item within the first explanation, the user can simplyclick on that item.andP;  As this procedure is unfolding, the system records thesteps so that the use can go back easily and see the previous screens--justas it often helps to reread earlier pages of a book after getting to newmaterial.andP;  Another nice feature of the help system is that individual userscan have different help systems, depending on their needs.andM;Part of the help system is a display of error messages for the current file.andM;Font display.andP;  As previously, Bestinfo does its own scaling of fonts for thedisplay.andP;  But the user can specify the size range for which bitmap fonts willbe used and, therefore, when scaling of vector fonts will begin.andP;  Genericfont representations are used, but they show actual widths.andP;  Similarly, theeffects of kerning and other spacing adjustments are displayed on the screen.andO;Bestinfo says that when Adobe Type Manager is available for OS/2 it willsupport it.andM;Editing in PageWright.andP;  The new PageWright editor, which is similar to whatwill become WordWright 2, provides three different editing options:andM;* Edit text in WYSIWYG mode on the page (see below for editing features).andM;* Edit monospaced text in a separate window with interactive handamp;j duringediting.andP;  As changes are made to text, new line endings are generatedautomatically, using the same hyphenation routine that will be applied on thepage.andP;  Fortunately, the system doesn't recompose the entire article everytime a line ending changes.andP;  It recomposes only as much as must be recomposedto update the screen.andP;  In our brief experience with this feature, the handamp;jprocess was so fast that recomposition didn't distract our work.andM;* Edit monospaced text in a separate window with handamp;j turned off.andP;  For peoplewho don't need to see new line endings as they type--or who are distracted byinteractive breaking of lines--this mode enables typing an unlimited amountof text without having any new handamp;j take place.andM;The OS/2 PageWright text editor is immensely improved compared with the oldversion of PageWright, which offers no block moves, no search/replace,primitive cursor controls and generally slow operation.andP;  The new editingprogram supports block operations similar to those that are standard on mostmodern systems, with a mouse or function keys used to define blocks and move,copy or delete them.andP;  The search/replace feature (a single string at a time)can be run either forward or backward and in global mode (changing alloccurrences) or discretionary mode (stopping to confirm each occurrence).andM;As in XyWrite, the user presses the F5 key to initiate a comman, which in thenew PageWright brings a command line to the screen.andM;During editing in the separate window, the entire file can be scrolled andedited, unlike the &quot;exploded mode&quot; editor in Bestinfo's MS-DOS program, whichis limited to the current page.andP;  During WYSIWYG editing on the page, ofcourse, only the displayed page is accessible, but it is easy to go to thenext page and resume editing.andM;A different OS/2 editing program could be used in the window, but it wouldn'tprovide the proper link to the composition program to perform handamp;j based onthe layout.andP;  The file would have to be stored first and then handamp;j'ed withinPageWright.andM;Composition.andP;  There haven't been many changes to the composition program, buta nice one is the ability to restrict recomposition to certain elements, suchas an article, the current window or a section.andM;Two functions that we have been told are now implemented (on both the MS-DOSand OS/2 versions) are hung punctuation and automatic ligature generation.andO;Hung punctuation had been introduced earlier, but it hadn't been wellimplemented.andP;  It enables the user to set up a file of characters that will behung on the left and the right side, with specification of what percentage ofeach character is to be hung (very much like the Ultimate capability).andP;  Theoperator can turn the feature on and off within a file.andP;  Unfortunately, thishasn't worked when we have tried it, but Bestinfo claims it does work.andM;Ligatures are generated also by creating a file of character strings that areto be replaced by single-character ligatures.andM;The TableMaster program, which had been used primarily for importing tables,has been given extensive capabilities for manipulation of data.andP;  It supportsvertical and horizontal straddles (it previously had horizontal only),vertical centering, bottom alignment, and automatic division of data intocolumns with gutters.andP;  A column or group of columns can be selected anddeleted or resized.andP;  New data can be imported into an existing table.andM;The table program automatically produces an file of text and codes, whichthen can be edited.andM;Page makeup.andP;  Bestinfo has moved to a more standard means of structuring theelements on a page.andP;  Rather than requiring the operator to identify certaintext blocks as being attached to a page background or to a window, the systemnow treats text elements as layers within the same structure.andP;  Any elementcan be moved to the top or the bottom of the stack, or the user can cyclethrough the elements layer by layer.andP;  All that the user must do to act upon ablock of text is to click on it.andM;Other new features are rotation of elements on a page in 1/10[degrees]increments by typing a command in a dialog box (it would be nice to be ableto rotate visually also); a clipboard for cutting, copying and pastingelements; the ability to undo the last operation; and a function for groupingelements and acting on them as a group.andM;Also new are alignment functions using a base set of guides controlled by thepage grid, to which the user can add guides as needed, specifying if theguide serves as the top, bottom, left or right edge of the element.andP;  Therealso is a four-way alignment feature that can be used to center a frame.andM;To align two frames (windows) with respect to each other, guides can be drawnto serve for both.andP;  This isn't as easy as the alignment functions supportedby most display ad systems, but it works.andM;Pages now can be zoomed between 25% and 400% of actual size.andM;Graphics and color.andP;  With the new version of PageWright, color can be appliedto graphics or text using RGB or CMYK values, or they can be selected bypicking from a palette, after which the system finds the closest match basedon an industry standard scheme.andP;  Vignettes may be applied to boxes byspecifying the beginning and ending colors, a vertical or horizontaldirection and the amount of dithering.andM;Spreads and chokes can be calculated automatically for line art and text.andO;Trapping can be specified to position the trap line over the center, insideor outside of the object.andP;  Any PostScript file can be imported, processed,trapped and sent to a Scitex or Hell system.andM;Masks can be created by drawing silhouettes around objects.andP;  (imageWright isneeded for automasking.)andP;  Low-resolution transparent, white or inverted masksmay be applied to graphics for position only.andM;Images can be resized independent of the frame in which they reside.andP;  Otherfunctions include cropping, flipping, flopping and rotating.andM;Graphics can sit on a page background or be attched to a window.andM;Pricing and availability.andP;  PageWright/2 sells for $7,000 as a galleycomposition program, to which either or both pagination programs (one forlayout-driven publications nad one for books and technical documentation) canbe added for $3,000 each.andP;  Network support generally costs between $5,000 and$15,000, plus hardware and $250 per PageWright workstation.andP;  To run more thanone language requires the multilanguage module for $2,500 per server.andM;Existing users are given a dollar-for-dollar trade on what they had purchasedearlier, plus an optional upgrade support package.andM;At press time, Betinfo said it had installed three regular customer systemsand had other orders in hand.andP;  The new TableMaster will be ready in Octoberand a new version of WorldWright by the end of the year.andM;CSE live at PC Week, signs BillboardandM;Compatible Systems Engineering showed its latest layout and compositionsoftware, which is now being used for live production at PC Week.andP;  CSE alsoannounced a new contract with Billboard magazine.andM;At PC Week, five pages of the first issue in October were produced with thesystem, with the plan calling for 15 pages in the second issue, 30 in thethird, and the entire issue by the end of November.andP;  PC Week has 10 CSEworkstations running editorial software on the copy desk, five PageSpec unitsin the production room, and one Macintosh running MacPage.andM;The contract with Billboard, which already has been using a CSE editorialnetwork with its existing Atex system, calls for upgrading its file serverand adding two workstations: one for Page Spec and one for handamp;j.andP;  Later,additoinal units will be added, providing the first test proceeds properly.andO;One key requirement is to handle the Billbaord charts, including verticalcentering and tint striping, which CSE hoped to be able to demonstrate at theFolio show that began in new York on October 15.andM;Meanwhile, CSE continues to enhance the new composition features that ithopes will make it a key vendor of complete systems, rather than just layoutworkstations.andP;  New features on display included:andM;* Better feedback on file depth.andP;  The top of the file reports the amount ofoverset or underset copy.andM;* Vertical justification.andP;  The user selects a block to be justifiedvertically and specifies the maximum amount of extra space that can be addedbetween paragraphs.andP;  The system first inserts space between paragraphs, tothe maximum allowed, and then begins inserting space between lines--even tothe extent that more space might be used between lines than betweenparagraphs.andP;  This isn't the most sophisticated VJ feature in the industry,but it is a start.andM;* Automatic dropped initials.andP;  The operator can specify the letter, anyadditional indent on individual lines and a baseline jump.andM;* Headfit.andP;  The user types the headline and the system reports the amountover- or underset in en spacs.andM;* Top-alignment of text based on cap heights.andM;* The ability to un-handamp;j a file.andP;  Every system should offer this.andM;Frame shows Motif, Open LookandM;Frame Technology demonstrated its recently announced 2.1X software, whichoffers a Motif user interface running on X Window.andP;  Functionally, 2.1X is thesame as frame's Mac, Next and SunView versions, but the X/Morif versionunderscores Frame's commitment to adapting its application to the userinterface of the platform.andP;  Frame is the first well-known publishing productto offer a Motif user interface.andM;Frame also previewed its forthcoming Open Look version, due out in early1991.andP;  This, too, will run on X, but it will take advantage of both Sun'sNews window manager and the newly bundled Folio font technology, which arepart of Sun's OpenWindows.andP;  Now Sun will pay the Folio licensing fees, notFrame, on the OpenWindows versions.andP;  (See discussion of Sun in the Novemberissue of our Report on Desktop Publishing for details on its Open Fonts.)andM;An interesting aspect of OpenWindows is that because Sun (like most Unixvendors) was pressured into supporting X, it is possible to run either Motifor Open Look applications within OpenWindows.andP;  Users who want to compare thetwo can now launch them side-by-side on the same workstation.andP;  Frame's OpenLook version is still being refined, so we felt it premature to makeconclusive statements.andP;  Suffice it to say that it makes for an interestingcomparison.andM;IBM extends book handling aidsandM;IBM demonstrated a new version of its BookManager software with some keyenhancements.andP;  First, it is broadening the scope of the publishing softwareto focus on reading of information, rather than only on the creation ofdocuments.andP;  Second, it is encompassing a variety of platforms, rather thanjust the VM host computers that were supported by version 1.0 since itsintroduction in March 1989.andP;  Version 1.2 already runs on MS-DOS and OS/2machines, which were demonstrated in San Jose, and it will be available forVMS systems later.andM;BookManager was developed to support trends toward online access toinformation, the use of standards and storage on a variety of media.andP;  Itconsits of two parts: Build, for composing books, and Read, for accessinginformation, which was the part of the program being emphasized in San Jose.andO;The philosophy behind Read is to emulate and preserve as much as possible thebook metaphor.andP;  People already know how to read books, so they should findreading a file on a computer to be familiar and confortable.andP;  Toward thisend, a book has a title page, a table of contents and an index.andP;  When basictext is displayed, it doesn't appear with page numbers, which have no realmeaning in this environment; instead, it has only references to topics fromthe structure of the book.andM;Among the additions in version 1.2 of Read are hypertext links, a concept of&quot;bookshelves&quot; for grouping books, multilanguage support, CALS features, andstorage on CD-ROM as well as on network servers and traditional magneticmedia.andM;Hypertext links enable accessing additional information about a word forwords in a book.andP;  They can be set up in three ways: author-defined linksbetween a word in one place and a word in another place; any type ofreference placed in text, including cross-references, &quot;see figure&quot; notes,etc.; and associations inferred by teh structure of the document, such as torefer to a term found in a glossary either in the same document or in anotherone.andM;The bookshelf idea enables grouping books in a logical fashion so that theycan be searched or indexed as a group.andM;For the CALs market, IBM, which already accepts SGML-tagged files as input tothe Build program, has expanded its graphics support to include CCITT GroupIV and CGM vector formats.andM;Search engine.andP;  Read's search engine, using linguistics, provides full-textretrieval functions across documents and across media.andP;  It locates differentforms of words (plurals, gerunds, etc.), but perhaps its nicest feature isits means of ranking the occurrences of a word to aid the operator in knowingwhich ones are most likely to be useful.andP;  For example, it gives a higherranking to a word found in a headline or in an index than to one buried in aparagraph.andP;  It gives lower ranking to words that occur so many times in alimited area that they are likely to be &quot;noise&quot; words.andP;  We don't know theexact rules it follows and we haven't had a chance to test it in detail, sowe aren't in a position ito evaluate the accuracy of the ranking system, butit sounds like an excellent approach.andM;With the VM version, synonyms cnas be set up to locate different words orconcepts with the same meaning.andP;  This capability will be added to the OS/2and MS-DOS versions later.andM;The search arguments don't include the boolean or proximity functons that arefound on most retrieval systems.andP;  IBM believes that its ranking system worksbetter than systems based on boolean and proximity searches and that, atworst, these procedures can be misleading.andP;  But a proximity search featurewill be considered in the future for people desiring it.andM;After the user sets up the retrieval by specifying the word or words to belocated and the book or bookshelf to be searched, the system lists theoccurrences it found.andP;  Clicking twice on one item displays the text, witheach occurrence of the target word shown in color for ready identification.andO;Words with hypertext links appear in a different color.andP;  (Colors are userdefinable.)andP;  One area that could be improved is the text display, which usesthe traditional monospaced, white-on-black approach that is still commonamong word processors, but that is generally felt to be less attractive thanthe displays used with most page-oriented systems with high-resolutionmonitors.andP;  The BookManager display optimizes speed but sacrifices somethingin its emulation of the reader's environment.andM;The normal scrolling functions are available for moving through a document,with the exact capabilities depending on the platform and operating system.andO;It is possible also to move directly to the next or previous topic or thenext or previous match by keyboard command.andM;Language support within Linguistics extends only to Latin languages so far,but IBM has addressed most of the national languages of Europe among the 18currently offered.andP;  Efforts are under way to support the two-byte ideographiccharacters of Japanese Kanji, although no target has been set for offering aproduct to this market.andP;  Single-byte, non-Latin languages (e.g., Arabic,Hebrew and the family of Indian languages) are being considered for later.andM;Other features.andP;  BookManager 1.2 permits the operator to add notes to a book,but, in emulating a real-world situation, the notes don't change the textitself; they appear as marginal notes inserted by a reader.andP;  Notes are typedin a dialog box.andP;  After they are inserted in text, a flashing symbol marksthe location and enables anothe reader to access them.andP;  With the currentprogram, if the text is revised, the notes may no longer appear anchored tothe same text where they were inserted.andP;  IBM says it plans to provide abetter means of keeping the note properly organized when revision take place.andM;Pictures are indexed based on their callouts.andP;  With all versions except theOS/2 one, they are displayed on the same screen replacing the text.andP;  WithOS/2, they can be viewed in a separate window next to or instead of the textwindow.andM;It is possible to print text from the database within any version ofBookManager, though the procedures differ somewhat.andP;  With any machine, it ispossible to print a topic--that is, a heading from the table of contents,with or without notes that have been added.andP;  With OS/2, it is possible toselect any section of text and print it.andM;To facilitate users wanting to get started with BookManager, IBM said itwould offer a service of putting data on media, including stamping CD-ROMdisc.andM;Information International links AMS, MacandM;We had seen Information International most recently at the ANPA show in June,where it concluded its deal with Concept Publishing for worldwide marketingrights to Concept's Macintosh-based Adworks display ad product.andP;  Triple-I,having its own high-end display ad system running on a Sun platform, lookedto Adworks to complement its AMS product, not to replace it.andP;  At the Seyboldshow, it showed progress in that direction, but no new products.andM;Triple-I showed a new link between Adworks and AMS terminals.andP;  Using its ownsymbolic format language, files created on Adworks can be transferred to theAMS terminals for completion, if necessary, such as applying chokes andspreads (which currently aren't handled by Adworks).andM;This link with the Sun also integrates the Mac into the AMS filing system.andO;The Mac-based Adworks can use the Triple-I system for storage and retrievalof data and output to Information International imagesetters.andP;  From an admanagement standpoint, the Macs are part of a single system.andM;Adworks will have two paths for output: directly to PostScript, as in thepast (something the AMS system can't do), and in symbolic language via theSun system to Triple-I devices.andP;  The unbundled cost of Adworks, including thePostScript driver, remains at $4,995.andM;Interleaf 5: the introductionandM;&quot;No one has a generic job.andP;  Why should they have a generic publishingsystem?&quot;andP;  In that spirit, Interleaf introduced its new publishingenvironment: Interleaf 5, a new way to get at and distribute information.andP;  Ata press conference at the San Jose Convention Center, it was introduced as aproduct family centering on the concept of active documents, and as a newtechnology that is transforming Interleaf.andM;Because we devoted an entire article to the new system in our last issue, wewon't go into detail on its features here.andP;  We had hoped to be able to reportinformation on pricing but Interleaf was unable to supply it by press time.andM;In Europe, it will be sold through a direct sales/support organization aswell as through VARs.andP;  Interleaf is looking for VARs to handle markets thatdirect sales canht reach.andM;Interset to ship Mac versionandM;Interset demonstrated significant enhancements to Quoin the Macintosh versionof its commercial-composition system, but the big issue remaind unclear: howit will be distributed in the U.S.andP;  There continues to be a tremendous amountof interest among prospective dealers and distributors, but Interset's onlycomment is that it is working hard to make the proper arrangements, and thatwe are likely to hear a decision by the end of the year.andM;On the product front, Interset announced that initial deliveries of itssoftware will take place in the UK in the first week of November.andP;  No targetrelease date is scheduled for the U.S.--and obviously none will be fixeduntil channel issues are resolved.andM;Software status.andP;  Interset said that its developments since Drupa,incorporated in release 2.0, have been based on feedback from dealers andcustomers at that show, resulting in some changes in priorities.andP;  Thelayout-driven page makeup option has been postponed until release 2.u inDecember.andP;  PostScript output will be supported from the beginning, as willLinotype Cora, Compugraphic and Monotype languages, but other drivers (suchas Autologic ICL and Chelgraph Ace) will be delayed until 1991.andP;  Similarly, alink to Interset's own Graphics Master system has been delayed, primarilybecause of the availability of so many off-the-shelf graphics packages thatwill work in the interim.andM;As we reported earlier, the automatic book pagination program is scheduledfor later development, probably early next year.andM;New features.andP;  Some of the features that have been added since Drupa are:andM;* Continuation lines.andP;  The system automatically generates continuationmessages using any of 26 different numbering schemes, (1, I, i, A, a, one,etc.).andP;  If pages are inserted, moved or deleted, the system renumbersaccordingly.andP;  If the leading of the continuation lines differs from theleading of the body text, the continuation lines can automatically be alignedwith a baseline of the text.andM;* Kerning value modification.andP;  Interset has become the first vendor of acommercial composition system to adopt the kerning setup techniques of somedesktop products, for example, TypeStyler.andP;  The screen displays characterpairs that can be spaced visually or by typing a new value.andP;  The display isupdated interactively as the spacing increments are changed so that theoperator knows how the characters will look on output.andP;  The key to thisapproach, of course, is a good screen representation, which currently isn'tavailable.andP;  Interset is waiting for Apple's System 7 for a more accuratedisplay.andP;  Interset has gone beyond the desktop vendors, though, in thecompleteness of its program.andP;  Kerning values for one font can be copied andmodified for another font's table.andP;  Character pairs cna be deleted, replacedor copied to the clipboard.andM;* Customer spec file.andP;  It is possible to set up job parameters for individualcustomers and store them to avoid having to repeat the same procedure everytime a similar job comes in.andP;  Factors such as paper size, registration markesand handamp;j style can be included in the setup.andM;* File import.andP;  Files from PCs can be imported, with generic tags convertedautomatically to whatever is required on Quoin.andM;* Color.andP;  Up to 10 color layers can be created and output as layers bycommand.andM;* Size to fit.andP;  The system can be asked to adjust the point size, the setsize or the leading to make a block of text fit a given area.andP;  The user canprescribe maximum permissible values.andM;* Fit heading.andP;  A headline can be sized automatically to fit a given linemeasure either by specifying a depth (in which case hte system will modifythe set size to fill the space) or by specifying that type not be condensedor expanded (in which case it will modify the point size to fill the space).andM;* Overmatter indicator.andP;  When a frame is smaller than the text assigned toit, the screen indicates that excess text remains.andP;  The excess may be viewedoptionally in a window.andM;* Column balancing.andP;  The user can select multiple columns and ask that theybe balanced.andM;* Dropped initials.andP;  The system creates dropped initials that can be modifiedby the user.andM;* Rotation.andP;  Any frame or the text within a frame can be rotated in1/100-degree increments.andP;  Text in adjacent frames can be flowed automaticallyto the shape created by the rotated frame.andM;* Text runarounds.andP;  A scanned graphic can be used as a template to flow textin an irregular shape.andP;  The size-to-fit routine cna be used to make the textfill the shape exactly.andP;  Graphics formats that can be imported include EPS,TIFF and PICT.andM;* Shadow boxes.andP;  Corners can be square, rounded or beveled (including anycombination of those for the four corners).andM;As we reported earlier, Quoin runs on a Macintosh with a standard keyboard orwith the expanded, 174-key Interset keyboard.andP;  PostScript output is standard.andO;Interset hasn't yet addressed questions of multiuser functionality, which islikely to be a requirement in the future for many high-end markets.andM;Krohm: code system on SunandM;Krohm International appeared in the Sun Microsystems booth with its KIComposer--a code-based composition system for commercial, magazine and bookproduction.andP;  The initial version, running on a Sparcstation 1+ with an OpenLook user interface, only supports galley composition.andP;  It is scheduled fordeliveries in January.andP;  The book and magazine versions are scheduled forlater next year.andM;As we reported from ANPA, when Krohm demonstrated KI Composer on an IBMRS/6000 system, the system provides a WYSIWYG preview of files with aseparate window for editing text and codes.andP;  The preview uses true fonts orcan be mapped so that certain fonts represent other ones.andM;Magna's PageComp moves to Windows 3andM;Magna Computer Systems demonstrated the new Windows 3.0 version of thePageComp program introduced last spring under Windows '286/'386.andP;  Those andother changes make PageComp an impressive product as it nears its formalrelease, scheduled for about the time this issue is mailed.andM;The new version gains some advantages from Windows 3.0, including a moreMacintosh-like appearance and better memory management with the removal ofthe 640K barrier.andP;  Magna has added some other features, such as the abilityto flow text from page to page, file management sophistication, easier meansof creating formats, nice treatment of text that overflows a frame, andsupport for color.andP;  Composition speed also has been increased--by 20 times,Magna says.andP;  Still missing were a few items, including vertical justificationand the choice of a text editor for the editing window, both of which Magnasays will be in the first release.andP;  Not yet part of the program are specifiedfeatures for applications such as books, newspapers and display advertising,which Magna says it will offer in future releases.andM;Basic enhancements.andP;  The &quot;sidebar&quot; (the icons that can be selected to bringup tools and other functions) is now logon dependent so that differentoperators can have their own sets of icons appear automatically when theystart work.andM;Rotation of text is now supported in 90[degrees] increments.andM;In file management, it is now possible both to call files up from thedirectory, rather than by typing the name, and to highlight a job in thedirectory and access a list of takes associated with that job.andM;In the area of handamp;j, the eariler version recomposed the entire page every timehandamp;j was called, but now a single story can be handamp;j'ed by command.andP;  Magna stillplans to enable spot handamp;j of a frame or a paragraph by the end of the year.andM;The editing window has been enhanced to show tru line endings, making iteasier to locate places to edit, and to display paragraph and line numbers.andO;Editing features, though, haven't been finalized.andP;  Magna is debating whetherto make XyWrite or Word for Windows its basic editor.andP;  Added for the initialrelease--but not shown in New York or San Jose--is the ability to click on aline on the page and go directly to it in the editing window.andM;Enhancements to the user interface include nice notification of errors.andP;  Asmall red square denotes a frame that has an error, with the actual errorindicated in a separate window and embedded also in the text file in theediting window.andM;Overflow text is noted with a blue square in the frame, after which the useris given a choice of how to handle the excess copy.andP;  There are three options:create a new frame the depth of the extra text, expand the current frameenough to accommodate the excess, or view the overmatter.andP;  If nothing isdone, the text remains held for later assignment, such as on another page.andM;The alignment capability has most of the tools people will need for pagedesign, including top, bottom and center alignment of two frams based on auser-defined reference point.andP;  That is, the user selects a corner or a sideof a frame and indicates how to place that with respect to another frame,taking into account the gutter if desired.andP;  This function enables a secondframe to be given the same dimensions as an existing one.andP;  Alignment is basedon frame borders, not on the text in the frame; guides cna be set up visuallyto align text, rather than frames.andM;These alignment features can be used with graphic objects (drawn freehand orcreated with the circle feature) when text is to be flowed around them,making it easy, for example, to center a graphic within text blocks.andM;TIFF graphics can be imported directly into an existing frame or brought tothe page and moved freely.andP;  An autotrace feature enables creating an editablecontour around which text can be flowed, with a specified gutter between thegraphic and the text.andM;Items imported to the page can be specified as scalable or not scalable,depending on the intended function.andP;  Tables, for example, can be brought inand restricted to keeping their original frame size.andM;With the initial release of PageComp, output will be PostScript.andP;  But driversfor the Linotronic 300 and Berthold recorders in native mode will be offeredsoon.andP;  Others will be produced 90 days after receipt of order.andM;Creating formats.andP;  Magna has overhauled its facilities for creating formats.andO;In the past, a format file has been a list of commands generated by typing inthe full syntax of each item to be included.andP;  With the new version, threedialog boxes are available that serve as prompts for whatever items the userchooses to specify from a total of about 40 composition commands.andP;  When theseitems have been filled in, the system stores them as a named format that canbe accessed at any time for composition.andM;Commands can be embedded in a text file by selecting individual items in asimilar manner.andP;  Magna is still working on a smooth means of making changesto the text format within a paragraph.andM;A format file may be assigned to each job as part of the job setup and servesas the default format for that document.andM;Working with pages.andP;  Magna has made a lot of progress in making PageCompsuitable for real work.andP;  Pages can be added or inserted, with headers andfooters adjusted automatically for left and right pages.andP;  Stories can bejumped from one page to another, with continuation messages appearing insideor outside the text frame.andP;  The operator can move from one page to the pageon which the story is continued with a single keystroke.andM;The entire philosophy on frame relationships has been changed.andP;  Rather thangiving each frame a parent or child status and the associated hierarchicalrelationship, there now are no predefined relationships.andP;  Frames can begrouped or ungrouped arbitrarily at any time, locked on a page, linked in anyorder, displayed with or without text or graphics, and so on.andM;Magna hasn't implemented its plan for enabling multiple editors to work onthe same document, so we can't report exactly how that will be handled.andP;  Theplan is to allow two editors to work on different stories on the same page,but if a layout editor opens a page to change the layout, it won't bepossible to edit the text on that page.andP;  We're not sure we agree with thatapproach, but we'll wait until we see it to judge it.andP;  It would be nice to beable to edit a story, although obviously we can't expect someone to handamp;j astory against a layout that is being changed.andM;Color.andP;  Magna's approach to color involves assigning spot colors to frames(one color for the foreground and one for the background) and outputting themas individual layers.andP;  It will be possible to create fountains by specifyingthe number of steps and the direction.andM;For color images, Magna is working with SeeColor on incorporating scannedcontones into text pages.andP;  SeeColor's software produces a screen-resolutionversion of the image, which Magna's sizes and positions (with cropping to beadded in January '91) and puts into a page file that gets sent back toSeeColor for manipulation of the high-resolution version of the image.andO;SeeColor employs its own techniques for generating screen angles and sendsthe file to a PostScript interpreter supplied by Custom Applications, Inc.andM;Pricing.andP;  PageComp, which includes the entire functionality of Magna'sexisting production/composition products, costs $9,500 (U.S.andP;  only) for astandalone, nonnetworked copy of the software, including one output driver.andO;A system comprising software for two workstations residing on a network,including the file manager, print manager and output driver modules, costs$21,000.andP;  A similar system accommodating four workstations costs $33,000.andO;Pricing in other countries depends on dealer arrangements.andM;To add PageComp software to a MagnaFile system costs $7,500 for the firstworkstation.andP;  On an existing PageComp network, it costs $4,000 to addMagnaFile functionality to a PC, which wouldn't have PageComp features.andM;Additional output drivers are $2,500 each.andM;Personal Tex shows new versionsandM;Personal Tex demonstrated the standard version of its composition software,PC Tex, and two versions for '386 machines, all introduced recently.andP;  PC Tex,version 3.0, runs on any MS-DOS machine with 640K of memory, although 2 MB isrecommended.andP;  It handles more complex pages than version 2.93, which itreplaced.andP;  PC Tex/386 and Big PC Tex/386 use PharLap DOS extenders to makeuse of additional memory.andM;All of these versions have increased page-building capacities compared withversion 2.93 (double for the first two, quadruple for Big PC Tex/386),greater hyphenation table size (double and quadruple), larger buffers, and soon.andP;  They also support extended ASCII character sets, including many of theaccented characters used in European languages.andP;  These programs are priced at$249, $295 and $349, respectively.andP;  Existing users can upgrade for $50, $99and $149.andM;More Xtensions of Quark XpressandM;Although the main news from Quark was a prototype of a version of Xpress forthe PC, there was a roomful of third parties demonstrating Xtensions toXpress in a nearby hotel.andP;  Many of those on display were described in ourJuly 30 issue (Vol.andP;  19, No.andP;  21), so we'll skip them here.andP;  The ones thatwere new we'll mention briefly here.andM;We also picked up Quark's first catalog of Xtensions, which gives briefproduct descriptions and contact information on each third-party developer.andO;The catalog can be obtained directly from Quark.andP;  Still more Xtensions forQuark Xpress will soon arrive in the market.andM;Em's table editor.andP;  Em Software will soon ship Xtable, a table editor andformatter.andP;  It handles tables as a collection of Xpress text boxes, with theXdata Xtension keeping the cells of the table together.andP;  You can grab theentire table as a single object and stretch or squeeze it; all the cellsadjust themselves proportionally.andP;  If you lengthen or shorten the text in acell, it and all other cells in its row stretch or shrink to accommodate it,although you can specify maximum and minimum sizes.andP;  If you insert or deleterows and columns, all the following cells move over.andM;There are two ways to widen a column: one that leaves following columns inplace and one that pushes all following columns along with it.andM;There are commands to merge and split cells (to make straddle heads, forinstance), to duplicate whole rows and columns (including their formatting),to adjust gutters and to specify emphasis lines.andM;However, since each cell is an Xpress box, all of the Xpress text formattingfeatures are available.andP;  You can apply style sheets, background colors,decorative borders and so on.andP;  A cell can also contain a graphic of any typethat Xpress knows how to handle, including PICT, EPS and TIFF.andP;  The principallimitation is that you can only rotate cells in 90[degrees] increments.andO;(Xpress itself would allow any angle.)andM;Xtable can import data files from several databases and spreadsheets.andP;  Itwill be priced at $220, which includes a 60-day money-back guarantee.andP;  Emexpects to begin beta testing in November and ship the finished program byyear end.andM;Em's database publishing.andP;  Another product that Em Software is cooking up isXdata, a database record formatter.andP;  It imports tab- or comma-delimited datafrom Mac databases and spreadsheets, massages and formats the data, and poursit into Xpress text boxes.andM;You begin by setting up a &quot;record prototype,&quot; using a language that lookslike a Microsoft Word mail-merge script combined with HyperTalk-likecommands.andP;  The commands allow conditional (if-then-else) execution,comparison and string-manipulation operators (equal, greater, less, contains,is in, etc.), and data import control (read, next, exit).andP;  The text formats(font, size, indents, etc.) that you give the fields in the prototype will beapplied to the corresponding fields of each record as it comes in.andM;You then import the data.andP;  You can specify a beginning and ending recordnumber or just read the whole file.andP;  To keep speed high, you can tell Xdatahow often to let Xpress update the screen.andP;  Other than that, the process isautomatic.andP;  When it is done, you have a standard Xpress document that you canmodify using all of Xpress's tools (and other Xtensions).andM;The program was designed to use very little memory beyond what Xpress itselfneeds.andP;  Xdata needs only enough workspace to hold the prototype and two datarecords.andP;  But up to the limits of memory, there is no limit on the length ofa record or a field and no limit on the number of records.andP;  However, Xpresshas a limit of 2,000 pages per document.andM;Xdata is currently undergoing beta testing and should be ready for market inNovember.andP;  It will be priced at $200, and, like Xtable, carries a 60-dayguarantee.andM;K.andP;  Erf's Autopage.andP;  K. Erf Associates showed Autopage, a combinationXtension and application program for long-document batch pagination.andP;  Itincludes vertical justification, column balancing, anchored illustrations andfootnotes, and automatic renumbering of anchored items.andP;  Essentially,Autopage handles all vertical spacing decisions, overriding any line andparagraph leading commands or widow-orphan controls that may be in adocument's style sheets, while letting Xpress handle all line-justificationdecisions.andM;You begin by setting up the Xpress document and then flowing text onto pages.andO;This is done so that Xpress will handamp;j the text.andP;  You also mark where theanchors for illustrations and footnotes are to go.andP;  The Autopage Xtensionthen exports a collection of facts about the text.andP;  For example, it noteswhich lines are hyphenated, because the pagination program can be set toforbid a hyphenated line at a page break.andM;You then give the Autopage application an extensive list of parameters:optimum, minimum and maximum line spacing for the vertical justificationprocess, allowable space around heads and illustrations, whether to putanchored illustrations at the top or bottom of a page, allowable variation inpage depth and so on.andP;  You can also force a chapter to end on a left or rightpage.andM;Autopage will go back and forth through the entire document attempting tosatisfy all of the requirements.andP;  If it cannot satisfy all of them, then itwill make its best guess and print an error report.andM;When you return to Xpress, the Autopage Xtension will reflow the chapteraccording to the pagination decisions that Autopage has made.andP;  If you don'tlike the result, you can either edit the text and run Autopage again orsimply use Xpress's tools to adjust the document.andM;Autopage is priced at $5,100.andM;Virginia Systems' Indexing.andP;  For index generation, Virginia Systems isdeveloping an Xtension that exports the contents of Xpress text frames toSonar Bookends, a full-text indexing program.andP;  Bookends then sorts the wordsin the file (with the page numbers carried along during the sorting) andunduplicates the resulting word list, merging page references as it goes.andM;The output is a text file that can be imported back into Xpress.andP;  However,you will probably want to do edit the index first, deleting words that reallydon't matter and perhaps adding some words that, though they didn't occur inthe text, are germane to the subject matter.andM;Bookends can be set to ignore very short words (such as &quot;the&quot;) or words thatoccur too many times in the text.andP;  (Frequently occurring words are usuallyeither very common or jargon, neither of which makes for a good index.)andP;  Itcan also be told to index the occurrences of a specific list of words.andP;  Butit cannot be given a list of words to ignore.andM;Sonar Bookends is priced at $130.andM;Xerox launches new suiteandM;Xerox launched an impressive suite of new publishing products.andP;  The first,and probably most significant, is the DocuTech Production/Network Publisher,a digital copier that next year will become a network, on-demand printer.andO;DocuTech is a work horse, printing at 135 ppm and offering online binding aswell.andP;  Its output quality is excellent at 600 dpi.andP;  The price is in the$220,000 range.andM;We covered the DocuTech in the Latest Word of our last issue.andM;A week before the show, Xerox introduced GlobalView, the port of itsViewPoint graphical desktop and applications from the Xerox 6085 workstationto the Sun Microsystems Sparc architecture.andP;  It followed this at the showwith the introduction of two new applications--DocuTeam, for projectmanagement; and DocuBuild for publishing.andM;DocuBuild will be of particular interest to our readers.andP;  Developed by thepublishing group that handles the Xerox XPS, DocuBuild is a compound documenteditor for creating and producing structured documents.andP;  It includes abrand-new text editor, handamp;j and pagination modules and several graphicseditors brought over from ViewPoint.andM;Among other special features, DocuBuild provides context-sensitive stylesheets, on which are based context-sensitive tagging aids.andP;  It handles nativeSGML files, yet its formatting capabilities are far more sophisticated thanthe standard ViewPoint editor.andM;In our next issue, we will present an initial, in-depth look at theseworkgroup applications, as well as an overview of GlobalView and several newfeatures of the desktop--full-text retrieval and natural languagetranslation.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
