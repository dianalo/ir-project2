(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Defrocked PTL leader Jim Bakker isundergoing a battery of tests to determine whether he can standtrial, and will be examined by the same psychiatrist who evaluatedJohn Hinckley Jr., an official said.   Bakker's fraud and conspiracy trial in U.S. District Court inCharlotte was halted Thursday when Judge Robert Potter ordered himsent to the Federal Correctional Institute in Butner, about 30 milesnorthwest of here, to determine whether he is competent to standtrial.   Psychiatrists are giving Bakker examinations such as ink-blot andpersonality tests, said Bryan Bledsoe, executive assistant to thewarden. ``There's a standard battery of tests done in all thesecompetency referrals,'' he said Saturday.   Dr. Sally Johnson, Butner's chief of psychiatric services, whoalso evaluated presidential assailant John Hinckley Jr., will leadthe team making the evaluation, Bledsoe said.   Hinckley, who attempted to assassinate President Reagan in 1981and severely wounded his press secretary, Jim Brady, was foundinnocent by reason of insanity.   A University of Virginia professor who has studied televangelismand Bakker and his wife, Tammy, over the past decade said Sundaythat no matter what the psychiatrists find, Bakker has been livingin his own world.   ``Here's a man who most of the time lives in a fantasy world thathe and his wife and his close associates have created,'' saidJeffrey Hadden, author of ``Prime Time Preachers'' and``Televangelism, Power and Politics.''   He said they were pushed into the limelight through a combinationof hard work and luck, ``and then capitalized, exploited and tookadvantage of it, and the dream got bigger and bigger and bigger.''   ``I think that he just reached the breaking point,'' Hadden saidin a telephone interview from his home in Charlottesville, Va. ``ButI don't see it as catastrophic, and I don't see it as spellingmental illness.''   He cited the pressures of the conviction in July of former aidesand brothers David and James Taggart, the sentencing last month ofhis former top deputy Richard Dortch, and the collapse Wednesday ofprosecution witness Steve Nelson from dehydration caused by the flu.   Bakker, 49, is charged with 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy andfaces 120 years in prison and more than $5 million in fines.Prosecutors say Bakker used nearly $4 million in ministry funds tofinance a lavish lifestyle.   He was committed to Butner after psychiatrist Dr. Basil Jacksontestified Bakker was hallucinating and hiding his head under a couchin his attorney's office.   Potter suspended the trial at least until Wednesday, telling thejury nothing about Bakker's condition.</TEXT></DOC>
