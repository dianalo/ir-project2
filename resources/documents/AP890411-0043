Police said no casualties were reported from the brief Syrianhowitzer barrage against the deserted town of Souk el-Gharb, about15 miles southeast of Beirut.   A police spokesman, who cannot be named in line with standingrules, said ``there was no response from the Christian side to thebarrage.''   Shells fired by army commander Gen. Michel Aoun's mostlyChristian troops and by Syrian army gunners exploded in Christianand Moslem districts on Monday, killing two people and wounding 15.   That raised the toll to 180 people killed and 619 wounded sincethe current round of civil war fighting erupted on March 8.   Aoun had declared a ``war of liberation'' against Syrian forces.The Syrians have responded by shelling the 310-square-mileChristian enclave.   Syria is the country's main power broker with 40,000 troopsdeployed in predominantly Moslem areas covering 70 percent ofLebanese territory under an Arab League peacekeeping mandate.   France, which ruled Lebanon from the end of World War I untilindependence in 1943, has voiced concern about the fate ofLebanon's Christian community and sent a special envoy in an effortto contain the crisis.   The French government has not specified an arrival date for twoships carrying humanitarian aid that set sail for Lebanon lastweek, but press reports in Paris and Beirut said they were dueWednesday.   One vessel carries fuel and food. The other is a hospital shipwith beds, surgical facilities and medical supplies.   There are fears the ships' arrival could trigger heavierfighting.   Lebanese Moslem and leftist leaders have rejected their share ofthe French aid. Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt, whose ProgressiveSocialist Party militia is Syria's main ally in the currentconfrontation with the Christians, also warned the French shipsagainst docking at any Christian port.   The French envoy, Jean-Francois Deniau, accused Syria of tryingto block his mission by ordering its gunners last week to shell theFrench embassy in Beirut's Christian suburb of Hazmiyeh where hewas staying.   Deniau, vice president of the national assembly's foreignaffairs committee, warned today that opening fire at the Frenchships ``would be an act of war against France.''   The present confrontation broke out after Aoun ordered ablockade of militia-run ports that have been stripping the statetreasury of about $100 million annually in taxes.</TEXT></DOC>
