The 100,000 shares accounted for more than half his totalholdings of 165,641 Apple shares reported in SEC filings lastJanuary, although he continues to have options to purchaseseveral hundred thousand shares.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Sculley filed a document known as &quot;Form 144&quot; with theSEC on October 22, indicating that he planned to sell thestock the same day. Two other Apple executives, Kevin J.Sullivan, senior vice president for human resources, andEdward Stead, vice president and general counsel, said inseparate Form 144s that they planned to sell smaller amountsthat day.   Just the day before, Apple announced six new computers,including three notebook-sized machines called Powerbooks.The company's stock price had risen steadily in the daysleading to the announcement, closing at $55 the Fridaybefore, up from $47.75 on October 10.   Apple reported an 18% drop in fiscal fourth quarterearnings on October 17, although Mr. Sculley said at the timethat the company was just beginning to see the effects ofcost-cutting efforts.   All three executives indicated in the SEC filings thatthey expected to get about $55 a share for their stock. Thestock reached a high of $56.25 on October 22, closing thatday at $54.50.   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, the stockwas quoted at $48.75, down $1 a share.   None of the three could be reached for comment. An Applespokeswoman said sales by company officers are consideredpersonal matters, and she declined to comment. She said thecompany wouldn't disclose whether the sales were completed,noting that the executives aren't required to notify the SECuntil November 10.   SEC filings show that Mr. Sculley previously sold 100,000shares in January and a similar block in May 1990. Accordingto SEC filings, he acquired 374,000 shares through theexercise of options in October 1989, at $7.75 a share.   Large sales of stock are common in the computer industry,whose executives typically receive a significant part oftheir compensation in the form of stock options. Mr.Sculley's total compensation in 1990, according to a surveyby management consultants Towers Perrin, was about $16million -- including stock options valued at $14 million.   Mr. Sculley said last June, a month after ordering thefiring of 10% of Apple's 15,000 workers to cut costs, that hewould cut his $2 million annual salary this year by 15% andother senior managers would take reductions ranging from 5%to 15%.   Mr. Sullivan indicated in the SEC filings that he plannedto sell 25,000 Apple shares for a total of about $1.4 millionand Mr. Stead said he planned to sell 9,334 shares for about$520,000. According to the filings, both men acquired theshares through the exercise of options. The price wasn'tdisclosed.   The 134,334 shares the three officers planned to selltotal just a fraction of 1% of Apple's 119.3 million sharesoutstanding.   ---   SELLING HIGH: The two top executives of AST Research Inc.sold more than $9 million of the computer company's stock inearly September, at prices nearly 50% higher than they wouldget today, according to SEC filings.   Safi U. Qureshey, co-chairman, president and chiefexecutive officer, sold 59,000 shares at between $29.75 and$30 each, or a total of almost $1.8 million, the filingsshow. Thomas C. Yuen, co-chairman and chief operatingofficer, sold 250,000 shares at between $30 and $30.50 each,for a total of about $7.6 million, according to the filings.They also show that 150,000 of the shares Mr. Yuen sold wereacquired the day of the sale through the exercise of stockoptions at $3.50 each.   AST's stock price has tumbled in recent weeks amid concernover increased competition in the computer industry. Ittraded over-the-counter late yesterday at $20.75, up 50cents.   Mr. Qureshey and Mr. Yuen declined to comment. SEC filingsshow that both executives previously sold shares in August,although the total sales account for just a tiny portion oftheir total holdings. Together they continue to hold about20% of the Irvine, Calif., company's 30.6 million sharesoutstanding, a stake valued at about $120 million at currentmarket prices.   ---   A TIMELY BUY: Two Chrysler Corp. directors increased theirholdings last month, just a couple of weeks before the automaker reported a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss,sending the stock price up, SEC filings show.   Peter Magowan, chairman and chief executive of SafewayInc., bought 10,000 shares at $10.38 each, according to thefilings, boosting his Chrysler stake to 15,160 shares. JosephAntonini, chairman and chief executive of Kmart Corp., bought2,000 Chrysler shares at $11.25 each, bringing his holdingsto 4,210 shares, the filings show.   Chrysler shares traded at $12.375 late yesterday on theNew York Stock exchange. On paper, at least, that indicates aprofit of $19,950 on a $103,799 investment for Mr. Magowan,and $2,250 on a $22,500 investment for Mr. Antonini.
