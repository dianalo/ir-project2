But he insisted that the overwhelmingmajority of the pardons granted so far were valid.;   The Los Angeles-basedSimon Wiesenthal Center has submitted a list of 13 people it says werepardoned even though they took part in mass murders between 1941 and 1944,when Lithuania was occupied by invading forces from Nazi Germany.;  Vaicekauskas said he agreed to re-examine two cases even though Lithuanianinvestigators had determined that the Soviet charges against them were false.He said he could find no information in his files on the other 11 namesprovided by the U.S. group.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  New York Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910906  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  13A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  323  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday, September 6, 199100250111,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
