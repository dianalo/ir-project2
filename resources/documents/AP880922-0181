CORNELL</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Standing in front of a big, circular barn nearHancock, Mass., the Rev. Bill Turpee described how the Shakers, asmall, close-knit Christian community, considered round barns moreefficient in farming.   ``The efficiency of the Shaker barn meant that there would bemore time to worship and serve God,'' said Turpee, an AmericanBaptist minister from Boston, in the opening scene on a newinterfaith cable TV network, VISN.   Vision Interfaith Satellite Network started operations Monday,the country's first broadly ecumenical network involving a widespectrum of U.S. religious traditions.   To begin each day of broadcasts, network co-host Turpee, or awoman colleague still to be named, will offer a short descriptionof some religious group that has made an impact on American life.   The network's initial fare also represented a combination thatplanners say will be standard _ music, dramas with ethical points,call-in talk shows, documentaries and magazine-type exploration ofissues.   ``We're providing programs of a morals-faith kind that has beenat the core of our country's whole value system, but which largelyhas not been on national television,'' said the Rev. Wilford V.Bane Jr.   Bane, a United Methodist and the network's interim generalmanager, said, ``It's going to broaden the perspective and give amore rounded picture of what religious life is all about.''   Even ``for viewers without strong religious convictions,'' hesaid, it will provide ``entertaining and throught-provokingalternatives to ordinary television.''   With 10 major multisystem cable companies under agreement withthe network, it has a potential of reaching 18.5 millionhouseholds, but initially was estimated available to only about 6million households.   This was expected to grow toward the higher mark, and beyond, aslocal systems adjust channel assignments.   Start-up financing has come through the cable industry, whosefees are expected to cover the central operational budget of about$6 million annually. Denominations initially are footing mostproduction costs, however foundation gifts and commercialadvertising are expected once the number of subscribers isdetermined.   The new network has rules against any soliciting of money orproselytizing.   Launching of the network came at a time many cable systems wereseeking replacements for programs of scandal-tainted televangelistssuch as Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart.   The Rev. Daniel Matthews, an Episcopalian and board chairman ofthe network, said most religious television lately has emphasized``personal pietism exclusively slanted toward a narrowperspective.''   It ``gave a distorted image of American religious life,'' hesaid.   Matthews, rector of Manhattan's richly endowed Trinity Churchwhere the new network has offices, said it will reflect historicfaiths that have been ``the backbone of America.''   Besides mainstream Protestant, Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodoxand Jewish bodies the network also involves such groups as theMennonites, Salvation Army, Seveneth-day Adventists and Mormons.   ``For the first time we have an example on television of the wayreligion ought to work in a democracy, with tolerance andrespect,'' said George W. Baskin, the network's director of faithgroup relations.   Although Catholic bishops decided against using the network,participation was voted by the Association of Catholic Radio andTelevision Syndicators, including church orders and institutionsactive in TV production.   Richard P. Lindsay, communications officer for the Church ofJesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons), said VISN will offer``top-quality, values-oriented programming,'' appealing to a``broad spectrum of viewers.''   The network's program director, Jeff Weber, a Presbyterian,corralled a varied composite for opening week, ranging from dramasproduced by Seventh-day Adventists to magazine shows produced byRoman Catholics and Lutherans.   At the outset, broadcast schedules were limited to five hours onweekdays, 1 p.m. to 6 p.m. (EDT), and longer on weekends, from 7a.m. to 5 p.m. on Saturdays, and 6 a. m. to 5 p.m. Sundays.   Children's shows have a big place only on Saturdays, along withweekend Bible study shows, dramas and worship.   The network expected to expand to a 12-hour daily schedule bythe first of the year, including prime evening time.   The Rev. Bruno Caliandro, a United Methodist and the network'sdirector of program development, predicted the network will bereaching 30 million households within two years.   Besides denominationally produced programs, he said the networkacquires programs from other producers, and also will produceprograms itself, with some now in planning stages with variousacademic institutions, including:   Programs on biomedical issues with the Chicago Medical Center,on world religions with Harvard, on everyday ethical problems facedby Americans with Boston University, and on interdisciplinaryviewpoints with Notre Dame.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Fri PMs Sept. 23.</NOTE></DOC>
