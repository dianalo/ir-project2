So far, eight of the 13 member states have endorsed the idea of a production-monitoring scheme that would provide on-site field checks of output. Leading oil ministers are betting that all members will have agreed to such a system before the next OPEC conference, which begins Dec. 9 in Vienna.    Unanimity on monitoring output would remove some of the acrimony expected in the resolution of the two major issues facing OPEC at the December meeting: the levels to be set for base prices and production quotas. Agreement on a method to monitor output -- permitting the world to be confident of what OPEC actually is producing -- would contribute to stable oil prices next year. &quot;Nothing would help the oil markets more than OPEC production transparency,&quot; said a petroleum economist who advises the ruler of one non-OPEC producing country.    There is, of course, considerable skepticism in the industry that OPEC can ever succeed with a production-monitoring program. The exporters have been flirting with various control schemes since first adopting production quotas in 1978. But the systems inevitably break down because some OPEC members invariably cheat. Previous efforts to monitor production, including the hiring of a Dutch accounting firm to audit OPEC output, failed.    But no one in OPEC wants to return to the chaos of 1986, when oil prices collapsed as all 13 exporters battled for market share. And OPEC members can't any longer bank on Saudi Arabia to bail them out.    The Persian Gulf kingdom used to adjust its own production up or down according to total demand for OPEC oil. But Saudi Arabia calculates that this role cost it $109 billion in recent years. So it refuses to be the &quot;swing&quot; producer now -- a point strongly underscored by Hisham M. Nazer, the Saudi oil minister, in his U.S. visit this week.    Although producing up to its quota of 4.3 million barrels a day, Saudi Arabia is all but alone among Persian Gulf members in honoring its quota. Daily OPEC output, in fact, routinely exceeds 18 million barrels. OPEC's overall ceiling is 16.6 million barrels a day.    Iraq, which refuses to accept a production quota lower than Iran's 2.4 million barrels a day, is now producing more than 2.7 million. It has reported plans to push its output to three million barrels a day. The United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait and Iran also frequently exceed their quotas, and the Iranians are understood to be discounting prices to keep volumes up.    But all six Persian Gulf members of OPEC, including the warring nations of Iran and Iraq, have agreed to the concept of a new production-monitoring system, according to Rilwanu Lukman, OPEC's president. So have OPEC's two South American members, Venezuela and Ecuador, Mr. Lukman said. As OPEC's so-called Committee of Three, he and two other leading oil ministers, Indonesia's Subroto and Venezuela's Arturo Hernandez Grisanti, got the commitments in their tour of member countries prior to the December meeting to seek high-level compliance with OPEC's price and production aims.    Mr. Lukman, who is also Nigeria's oil minister, supports output monitoring. Speaking in Caracas, Venezuela, he said he is &quot;highly optimistic&quot; about the outcome of the committee's visits to the remaining OPEC countries.    Several influential heads of state, including King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, already have publicly endorsed the idea of production monitoring with on-site field inspections. But a senior OPEC official noted yesterday that &quot;a proper implementation of such an agreement,&quot; specifically the technical details, still must be worked out. </TEXT></DOC>
