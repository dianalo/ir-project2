If, however,we are required to be practical it becomes more difficult to predictwhat can or should take place. In this discussion, the author restrictshimself to predictions based on advances already operational in a clinicalmicrobiology laboratory somewhere. The author says the greatest potentialfor future progress is through the interaction of minicomputer systemsdesigned for the clinical laboratory with other computers both largerand smaller. The highly competitive market associated with automatedinstruments will produce the best of microcomputer applications. Bacterialidentification accuracies over 95% have already been reported with mostof the major systems. These instruments use microcomputers that can beinterfaced on-line as has been done in clinical chemistry and hematology.The minicomputer laboratory system can in turn be interfaced to the mainframecomputer used for the HIS or other larger systems to make the data asuseful as possible outside the laboratory.</TEXT></DOC>
