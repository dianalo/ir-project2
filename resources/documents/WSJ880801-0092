Clark Jr. (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> FIN BNK MON ECO </IN><TEXT>   Some of the headlines last week proclaimed that the economy slowed down in the second quarter, and that's true. The Commerce Department's preliminary estimate was that the inflation-adjusted gross national product in the April-June period rose by 3.1%, down from 3.4% in the first quarter and from an astonishing 6.1% in the fourth quarter of 1987.    But the statistics also showed a pickup in inflation, and the second-quarter slowdown wasn't sharp enough to prevent the markets from worrying about more of the same. More figures are due out this week and, in some analysts' view, they aren't likely to diminish inflation fears.    Today the Commerce Department is expected to report a reasonably robust rise of about 0.5% in construction expenditures for June, on a seasonally adjusted basis. Economists at Boston Co., an economic advisory firm, credit &quot;rising single-family home construction and better industrial activity.&quot;    Tomorrow, the June leading indicators index, based on statistics that tend to rise or fall in advance of the economy, is expected to bounce back from its 0.1% May decline with a sharp rise. Estimates of the June increase range between 1% and 1.5%. Also tomorrow, analysts look for the Commerce Department to report that manufacturing orders and shipments showed significant increases in June.    The economists at Boston Co. think auto sales for July showed a modest drop from the strong June rate, with the decline concentrated in domestic sales. A modest decline wasn't unwelcome to some domestic firms that have been keeping pace with demand only with profit-limiting overtime.    Analysts think the July statistics for payroll employment and the unemployment rate, to be reported on Friday, won't be quite as strong as the numbers for some prior months, but they are still likely to reflect an expanding economy. Lacy Hunt, chief economist for CMandamp;M Group, thinks the unemployment rate will remain at the June level of 5.3% of the work force, a rate that some economists think is close to full employment, while some analysts think the rate may edge up by about a tenth of a percentage point.    The Boston Co. economists believe that payroll employment rose by 175,000 in July, down from a 346,000 gain in June. They call this a &quot;relatively modest increase,&quot; reflecting a short period between employment survey dates and only a slight rise in manufacturing employment.    Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, said last week that he expected economic growth to slow further in the second half of this year, thus helping to ease inflation's pressures. &quot;I'm pretty confident that we're not on the verge of an inflationary surge,&quot; he said.    By and large, economists agree with Mr. Sprinkel. The 51 analysts interviewed monthly by Blue Chip Economic Indicators, a Sedona, Ariz., newsletter, on the average look for the real gross national product to rise by 2.4% in the current quarter, down from the second quarter's 3.1%. And the Blue Chip analysts don't expect inflation to surge, although on the average they do think the consumer price index will be rising at an annual rate of 5% by the first quarter of next year.    ---   IT'S AN ILL WIND: Commercial and industrial loans of all U.S. commercial banks rose by $21.9 billion in the first five months of this year, nearly twice as much as the increase for the full year of 1987. As Lacy Hunt comments, the surge in business short-term credit demand is doing nice things for commercial bank profits, as banks earn more on business loans than they do on Treasury securities. But Mr. Hunt suggests that bank demand for Treasury issues will diminish at a time when the Treasury really needs money; it's expected to run a deficit of as much as $110 billion in this year's second half. This situation increases the chances for higher interest rates.    ---              The Economy in Numbers      Statistics Released in the Week Ended July 29                                             CHANGE                                             (from prior                                  TOTAL      period    Money supply     M1 Week ended     July 18 (in billions)        $781.4     -$3.1     M2 Week ended     July 18 (in billions)      $3,023.6     -$3.8     M3 Week ended     July 18 (in billions)      $3,819.8      +2.4    Real GNP     Second Quarter, revised     annual rate (in trillions)  $3.9863     +3.1% -    Savings rate     June, change in     percentage points              4.3%      -0.1    Auto sales     Mid-July total     vs. year ago                271,941     +3.4%    New jobless claims     Week ended July 16          318,000     +7.8%    Purchasing Managers' Index     July, change in     percentage points               59%       -.3    Personal Income     June, annual rate     (in trillions)               $4.042     +0.7%    Personal consumption     June, annual rate     (in trillions)               $3.214     +1.0%    Farm prices     July, index                    142%     +3.6%    Durable goods orders     June (in billions)          $125.23     +8.8%    Sindlinger Positive    Household Liquidity Percentage     Three-day period     (July 26-27-28)                68.2     +0.6%         Statistics to Be Released This Week    Construction spending              (Mon.)
