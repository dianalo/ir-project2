<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-92-1070 </DOCNO><TEXT>Until recently, there existed two contradictory perceptions regardingthe behavior of PCBs in the general environment. One was that the commercialPCBs (Aroclors) were essentially indestructible, and would persist indefinitelyat spill sites unless removed by some form of remedial action. The otherwas that the analytical gas chromatograms of PCBs recovered from environmentalsamples rarely matched those of either individual or mixed Aroclors,so that various arbitrary conventions were needed in order to reportenvironment PCB analyses in terms of Aroclor compositions. The chromatographicmismatch was attributed to weathering of the PCBs. During the past fouryears, the authors have been studying the composition of environmentalPCBs with high-resolution capillary gas chromatography and mass spectrometryin order to better characterize the PCB weathering phenomenon and identifyits origins. It is now apparent that it includes at least four differenttypes of PCB alteration processes: partitioning into a mobile phase,oxidative biodegradation, reductive biodegradation (dechlorination),and photolysis by sunlight (1-6). These four processes, their environmentalrequirements, their recognition features, and their influence on PCBfate are described in turn. 6 references.</TEXT></DOC>
