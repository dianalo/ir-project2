Stocks were lower in Frankfurt, Tokyo and Hong Kong and mixed in Sydney but substantially higher in Singapore.    London's 100-share index rose 19.3 points to 2225.1. The Financial Times 30-share index rose 24.9 points to 1752.1. Volume fell to 454.1 million shares from 634 million Friday.    Dealers said trading was &quot;desperately quiet&quot; because of summer vacations, but prices gained after weekend press reports played down fears that the British economy might be overheating. Technical reaction to last week's drop of almost 90 points in the 100-share index also boosted shares, dealers said.    Oil shares were lower on the drop in crude oil prices. Shell Transport andamp; Trading lost 30 pence to 1,353 pence ($22.10); British Petroleum, trading ex-dividend, dropped 12 to 341, and Britoil was down 8 at 308.    Among major gainers, B.A.IT Industries, a major tobacco concern, rose 14 to 639 after a U.S. appeals court decision that warnings on cigarette packs shielded American Brands Inc. from a charge that it failed to warn consumers adequately about the health dangers of cigarettes.    Among banks, Barclays was up 11 at 560, National Westminster rose 11 to 723, Lloyds gained 1 to 345, and Midland was unchanged at 455.    Building-related shares showed good gains after being hit by the rise in bank lending rates this month. Pilkington rose 9 to 295, BPB Industries gained 10 to 374, and Blue Circle Industries was up 10 at 474.    Tokyo's Nikkei stock average fell 10.66 points to 25754.33, its first decline in four sessions. Volume was 600 million shares, slower than the 650 million in Saturday's half-day session. The Tokyo Stock Exchange index fell 3.73 points, or 0.17%, to 2161.24.    Traders said intervention by the Bank of Japan to support the dollar led to a late stabilization of export-related shares at the expense of domestic-demand and financial stocks. Export-led electrical and computer shares closed mixed to stronger as a result.    Kyocera rose 80 points to 6,150 yen ($43.25), Matsushita Electric Industrial gained 30 to 2,410, and Sony rose 20 to 4,980, while Japan Victor fell 50 to 2,950. Among car makers, Toyota Motor was unchanged at 2,000, Honda Motor fell 30 to 1,590, Nissan Motor fell 4 to 715, and Isuzu Motors rose 13 to 418.    Financial shares met with profit-taking after rising early in the day, with securities firms especially hard hit. Nomura Securities closed 20 points lower at 4,940, Nikko Securities slipped 40 to 2,640, Yamaichi Securities dropped 30 to 2,660, and Daiwa Securities fell 60 to 3,190.    In Frankfurt, a few sell orders by professional traders and foreign investors more than offset the small number of buyers, but analysts said the market wasn't under heavy selling pressure.    Siemens fell 8.90 marks to 666.10 marks ($367.20) on the company's expected weaker earnings. In the auto sector, Daimler-Benz was down 5.50 marks to 1,148.50, while Bayerische Motoren Werke, supported by foreign demand, was unchanged at 755, and Volkswagen gained 0.70 mark to 402.70.    In other European markets, share prices ended higher in Stockholm, Paris and Brussels, lower in Zurich and Milan and mixed in Amsterdam.    Singapore stock prices surged in a continued recovery from their sharp declines in the middle of last week. Volume remained moderate, with many institutional investors staying on the sidelines, although some foreign buying was evident.    Industrial shares in Sydney rose to record levels, while mining stocks continued the decline they began last week on an apparent easing of Mideast tensions. Yesterday's fall came despite firmer gold prices in New York Friday.    Hong Kong stock prices dropped in moderate trading, mostly because of a rumor that Cheung Kong will announce a rights issue Friday.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva.
