(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Sanford C. Sigoloff, the corporate``White Knight'' who rescued Wickes Cos. Inc. from bankruptcy fiveyears ago, on Sunday announced a management-led leveraged buyoutoffer of $12 a share.   The retail giant, including the Builder's Emporium and WickesFurniture stores, also announced a net loss of $12.4 million forthe second quarter ended July 30, said company spokesman MichaelSitrick.   Sigoloff disclosed that WII Holdings Corp., a firm heestablished with members of his Wickes management team, will offerto purchase nearly 40 million shares of outstanding common stock,Sitrick said. He said WII stands for W-2 or Wickes 2.   The offer is nearly $3 higher than Wickes' closing stock priceof 9] on the New York Stock Exchange last Friday.   ``While I have strong confidence in the long-term viability andprospects of our continuing businesses,'' Sigoloff said in aprepared statement, ``it has become increasingly clear to me, aswell as the other directors of the company, that our stockholderswant to maximize the value of their investment in the company inthe immediate near-term.''   The 39,846,600 shares sought in the merger deal represent about83 percent of Wickes' outstanding shares, Sitrick said.   The offer is scheduled to be in effect from Aug. 26 to Oct. 20,he said.   It is expected that the principal investors in WII Holdings willbe institutional investors, including Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,which promised no problems in arranging financing for the buyout,Sitrick said.   The offer is void if fewer than 50 percent of outstanding sharesare sold, he said.   The company's net loss for the second quarter amounted to 28cents a share, with reported earnings of $10.4 million, or 19 centsa share, on sales of $937.9 million and losses from discontinuedoperation of $22.8 million, or 47 cents a share.   In April 1982, Wickes, with assets estimated at about $3billion, became the largest U.S. company to file for bankruptcyprotection. But less than two years later, creditors approved aplan allowing Wickes to emerge from Chapter 11 proceedings.   Analysts had predicted it would take Wickes at least five yearsto erase the accumulated red ink.   The force behind the comeback was Sigoloff, who earned thenickname ``Ming the Merciless'' for the tough-minded business movesand hard-nosed cost cutting he employed to resuscitate two otherLos Angeles companies in the 1970s: Republic Corp. and Daylin Inc.   Sigoloff reorganized Wickes by selling off seasonal divisionssuch as MacGregor Golf and Wickes Agriculture. At the same time herevamped store displays and appeared in television commercials andoffered his personal guarantee of renewed product quality andservice.</TEXT></DOC>
