Mr. Holmes a Court would acquire the media operations for an undisclosed price from John Fairfax Ltd., which also would sell some of its assets to another Australian financier, Kerry Packer.    The planned asset sales are part of an agreement between the two financiers and Warwick Fairfax, a member of John Fairfax Ltd.'s founding family, who at the end of August launched a bid for the Australian media concern. Under the accord, Mr. Fairfax raised his bid for John Fairfax Ltd. and agreed to sell the assets to Messrs. Holmes a Court and Packer upon the successful completion of his offer. In return, the two financiers agreed to sell their shares in John Fairfax Ltd. to Warwick Fairfax at the new, higher price.    Mr. Fairfax yesterday raised his bid for the John Fairfax Ltd. shares he doesn't already control to 8.50 Australian dollars ($6.17) each, from 7.50 dollars. That values the company at 2.55 billion dollars ($1.85 billion). The company's shares fell 10 cents in Australia yesterday, to 8.40 dollars. The decline came before the agreement was announced, but the general outline of the accord already had been reported in the Australian Financial Review.    Mr. Fairfax -- who is making the bid through his private company, Tryart Pty. Ltd. -- also changed his alternative offer to 40 dollars plus 11 shares in John Fairfax Ltd.'s David Syme andamp; Co. unit for every six John Fairfax Ltd. shares.    Mr. Fairfax said his revised bid is conditioned on Tryart's accumulating at least 75% of John Fairfax Ltd.'s shares. He is expected to have little difficulty in reaching that goal.    Various members of the Fairfax family own about 51% of John Fairfax Ltd., with Warwick Fairfax entitled to about 25%. James Fairfax, chairman of John Fairfax Ltd., said he would accept the higher bid from Tryart for his John Fairfax Ltd. shares, &quot;subject to there being no higher offer.&quot; John Fairfax, deputy chairman, made a similar statement. His family would acquire some smaller Fairfax publications and a radio station in Brisbane.    Mr. Holmes a Court holds about 9% of John Fairfax Ltd.'s shares, while Mr. Packer holds about 4%.    Mr. Holmes a Court would greatly expand his media interests through the transactions. Through his Bell Group Ltd., he would purchase the Australian Financial Review, the National Business Review of New Zealand, Australia's Times on Sunday and the eight-station Macquarie radio network in Australia. A source close to the negotiations said Mr. Holmes a Court would pay a total of about 475 million dollars for his acquisitions. Bell Group's shares rose 10 cents yesterday, to 10.15 dollars, before the announcement.    Mr. Holmes a Court already publishes the main newspaper in the state of Western Australia, owns television stations in the Australian cities of Perth and Adelaide, and has a small stake in a New Zealand newspaper publisher. He would become the only publisher with direct interests in newspapers, television and radio in Australia.    Mr. Holmes a Court has been seeking for the past year to expand his interests in the media, and some analysts expect he will try to add to his operations through takeovers in other countries. His expanded operations in Australia would contend with Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., the only Australian media concern bigger than John Fairfax Ltd.    Mr. Packer, meanwhile, would purchase John Fairfax Ltd.'s magazine division, not including the business magazines; the Canberra Times, the main daily newspaper in the capital city; and the Canberra Chronicle. Mr. Packer, who would make the acquisitions through his unlisted Consolidated Press Holdings Ltd., would pay between 200 million and 300 million dollars, the source close to the negotiations said.    John Fairfax Ltd.'s David Syme unit, which was to have taken control of the Australian Financial Review and the Fairfax magazines under a restructuring plan Warwick Fairfax announced along with his original bid, now would control the business magazines and some smaller units. David Syme already owns the Melbourne Age newspaper and some other publications.    Anne Summers, manager of John Fairfax Ltd.'s North American operations, said the company would retain ownership of Ms. magazine of the U.S. Fairfax's agreement to acquire Ms. was announced last week. Ms. Summers will become editor-in-chief of the magazine.    John Fairfax Ltd. also has a joint venture with Time Inc. of the U.S. to publish a local version of Time magazine in Australia. The source close to the negotiations said this venture would stay with the business-magazines division that the David Syme unit will control. </TEXT></DOC>
