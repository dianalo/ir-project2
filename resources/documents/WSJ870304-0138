He didn't make a more specific forecast.    In the year ended Sept. 30, 1986, Saatchi posted a 74% rise in pre-tax profit to $109.4 million, converting the pound at its current rate, and a 72% gain in net income to $58.4 million.

Saatchi, seeking to expand its consulting activities, yesterday announced the purchase of Cleveland Consulting Associates, Cleveland, for $2 million, plus possible future payments. The firm provides information consulting to help consumer-marketing companies plan their retail distribution, Saatchi said. </TEXT></DOC>
