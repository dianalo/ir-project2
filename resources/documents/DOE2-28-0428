At the beginning of these investigationsno experience and thus also no design values were available in Denmarkfor reverse roof systems. A comparative study was carried out to investigatethe beahviour of extruded polystyrene rigid foram boards, polyurethaneinsulating boards as well as of rock fibre and glass fibre insulatingboards. The specimens were placed in different measurement fields onthe roof of a building with the non-ventilated flat roof of the testbuilding serving as quasi calibrated heat flow meter. The temperaturesoccuring in the different measurement fields were regularly recordedover a period of 178 days during the winter of 1983/1984. The thus resultingthermal resistance deviate only by 5-24% from the resistances calculatedfor the dry state of the insulating material.</TEXT></DOC>
