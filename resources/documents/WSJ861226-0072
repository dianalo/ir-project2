Wild Acres is a lovely 3,000-acre retreat near this community in the Pocono Mountains. It once was the property of a reputed New York mafioso, the late Michael D'Alessio. He and his associates, says a Pennsylvania lawman, &quot;used to go out in a boat and hold meetings in the middle of the lake where nobody could overhear.&quot;    While mobsters are still drawn to the Poconos, other people hold meetings, too. Among them are hundreds who say they were fleeced when they bought small lots at Wild Acres for vacation and retirement homes.    These aren't people who aspire to lavish weekend living and can recoup any losses by engaging in a little takeover arbitrage. They are middle-class families of civil servants, small-business men, teachers and corporate spear carriers who have worked and saved for years to fulfill the dream of a house in the country.    In all, about 2,200 lots were sold. The purchasers of more than 1,000 of them now have built that house in the country, but many of these find themselves disturbed by the way privately managed Wild Acres is run. The purchasers of at least 250 of the remaining lots have a worse problem: Because of action by state environmental authorities, they can't build at all on their properties, which cost them an estimated $3.6 million.    They have complained to federal and state agencies and have received advice, sympathy and the assurance of the Pennsylvania attorney general's office that a criminal and civil investigation has begun. But it is unlikely they will ever recover their money. &quot;I thought I was a sophisticated person,&quot; says a New York City woman who bought Wild Acres property. &quot;How little I knew.&quot;    This predicament came about when the state environmental authorities revoked a permit to build a sewage-treatment plant at Wild Acres. That occurred on Sept. 4, 1981, as a result of a lawsuit filed in October 1979 by sportsmen who charged that the plant's effluent would kill pickerel, bass and perch in nearby Lake Maskenozha. Septic tanks can be used elsewhere in Wild Acres, but the soil on the 250 affected lots isn't suitable for them.    Most of the 250 lots were sold after the suit was filed -- in 1980 and 1981. In fact, some were sold after the revocation, although revocation meant that home-building permits could no longer be issued for any of them. Many purchasers say that salesmen for the developer, Marcon Inc., a subsidiary of All-American Realty Co. of Wayne, N.J., either didn't mention the looming problem or made light of it.    Misfortunes like these have put this fast-developing section of northeast Pennsylvania on the map for more than scenic splendor. Speaking of this region in general, not of Wild Acres in particular, an investigator for the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development says: &quot;Texas and Florida are the most active states for land-sales abuse, but the Poconos are right up there.&quot;    Unhappiness seems out of place at Wild Acres. With scenic lakes, woods, clean air and abundant wildlife, it offers facilities for tennis, boating, swimming and skiing. &quot;In the winter,&quot; says one year-round resident, &quot;it looks like a picture post card.&quot;    Nikki Mayer, a U.S. Customs inspector from New Jersey, hankered to own a piece of this paradise. On Sept. 27, 1981, she and her husband paid Marcon $13,200 for a parcel of land. &quot;We were going to build an all-year house with wall-to-wall carpeting,&quot; she says. The couple planned to move to Wild Acres permanently.    Five years later, there is still no house. Ms. Mayer says that when she bought her half-acre lot, Marcon didn't tell her that the sewage plant's permit had been canceled 23 days before. Nobody knows when, if ever, the sewage plant will be allowed to operate or whether a different system will be installed.    Meanwhile, some of the lot owners are paying off mortgages obtained at rates as high as 18% -- and are being dunned for maintenance and services on land they don't use. Chances of recouping their investment from the developers are dim: Marcon and All-American Realty are bankrupt, and creditor banks have grabbed most of the debtors' assets. &quot;The little people get stepped on again,&quot; says a bitter Ms. Mayer.    Hundreds of people who purchased property in the Poconos at other subdivisions operated by All-American Realty are in a similar pickle. Because sewage facilities were inadequate, public officials banned construction at Arrowhead Lake in 1982 and at Marcel Lake Estates in 1985. By one count, 1,800 people put $17 million into unbuildable property at Arrowhead Lake, Marcel Lake and Wild Acres.    Michael D'Alessio bought Wild Acres for $47,500 in 1945, according to the Pennsylvania Crime Commission, and lived there until his death in 1976. He and his brothers John and Alexander were identified in a U.S. Senate subcommittee report in 1963 as members of the Carlo Gambino crime family in New York. Deeds show that in 1965 Michael D'Alessio sold Wild Acres to his son, Michael Jr., for $400,000.    Michael Jr., a prominent Poconos home builder who spells his last name &quot;Dalessio,&quot; sold most of Wild Acres to Marcon Inc. in 1967 for $1.2 million. As part of the transaction, he received 20% of Marcon's stock, according to Irwin Marks, formerly a vice president of Marcon and of All-American Realty. Mr. Dalessio became a director and assistant secretary of Marcon, posts he vacated about 1977 when he sold his stake in Marcon.    Marcon and All-American Realty filed for protection against creditors in federal bankruptcy court in Newark, N.J., in September 1982. In February 1984, an official of the Department of Housing and Urban Development urged the bankruptcy judge to address the problem of sewage disposal at their developments -- &quot;a subject,&quot; HUD said, &quot;of blatant misrepresentation in the debtors' sales operations.&quot; But nothing was done for property owners.    The collapse of All-American Realty and Marcon resulted from high interest rates and declining revenue, Mr. Marks says. Combined revenue peaked at $12 million a year in the late 1970s. &quot;We were the largest builder of one-family homes in the Poconos and one of the largest in land sales,&quot; he says.    He denies that buyers were defrauded. &quot;We don't operate that way,&quot; he says. &quot;Those who bought {at Wild Acres after the permit was revoked} were told that the lots were not buildable till the sewage problem got resolved.&quot;    This statement is disputed. &quot;The Marcon salesman never told us there was a problem,&quot; insists Donna B. Della Pietra of New York City. &quot;He showed us the property and told us a sewage-treatment plant was going in.&quot; Mrs. Della Pietra and her husband bought a $12,000 home site from Marcon on Sept. 13, 1981, nine days after the plant's license was revoked.    On the property report that Marcon sent Mrs. Della Pietra are marginal jottings that she says were made by a Marcon salesman. One reads: &quot;Sewage lines are guaranteed extended by or before June 30, 1982.&quot; Says Mrs. Della Pietra: &quot;We were a young couple, just married. It was the biggest mistake we ever made in our lives.&quot;    Another New York couple, Mr. and Mrs. Frank Moraco, say that they, too, weren't told about the permit revocation when they bought Wild Acres property for $14,500 in July 1982. Marcon was so eager to close the deal, Mrs. Moraco recalls, that &quot;the salesman came all the way to Brooklyn to pick up our check.&quot;    Some buyers blame their bankers. Salvatore Dinolfo of Elmont, N.Y., a teacher of handicapped children, says that Northeastern Bank of Pennsylvania, in Scranton, didn't tell him that his $14,500 lot was unbuildable when it financed his Nov. 22, 1981, purchase. &quot;I wanted rest and relaxation and got a stomachache instead,&quot; he says.    Fumes a New York woman who got a Northeastern loan for her $13,000 lot: &quot;I'm paying an obscene 17%. How can the bank expect us to pay a mortgage on something unbuildable? This is not even in the realm of normalcy.&quot;    The bank &quot;wasn't aware till sometime in 1982&quot; of the permit's revocation, says Wayne Miller, a spokesman. &quot;We were under the impression that steps were taken on a local basis to correct the {sewage} situation,&quot; he says.    Ms. Mayer, the Customs inspector, says she made a $430 deposit in February 1982 to All-American Homes, an affiliate of All-American Realty, for construction of a $49,500 home. Richard Hansen, whom she dealt with at All-American Homes, never told her that the lot was unbuildable, she says. &quot;The next thing we know,&quot; she adds, &quot;All-American went out of business, our deposit was lost and the home will never be built.&quot; Mr. Hansen says he had been aware of a problem at Wild Acres, &quot;but it looked like everything would be settled,&quot; he says.    Ms. Mayer says she was later told by All-American Realty that Parkside Construction, another Poconos home builder, would honor her contract with All-American Homes. V. James Rocco, formerly the vice president of All-American Homes, now is the president of Parkside Construction and its 50% owner. Michael Dalessio Jr. is the vice president and owns the other 50%, according to Marshall Anders, a Stroudsburg, Pa., attorney representing Parkside.    If All-American Homes didn't inform some buyers that their property was unbuildable when it took their deposits, how could that have happened? Attorney Anders says that according to Mr. Rocco, &quot;All-American Realty and Marcon had been advised by counsel and engineers that the ban on construction would be lifted in a short time. That advice turned out to be wrong.&quot; A Pennsylvania court rejected Marcon's appeal of the ban in 1983.    Though they are under court order to do so, numerous property owners refuse to pay dues to the &quot;Wild Acres Country Club,&quot; as stipulated in their sales contracts. Dues have jumped to $425 yearly from $200 in the past two years. There is a small clubhouse as well as a swimming pool, but dues mainly are for the upkeep of Wild Acres' roads and other amenities.    One New York woman dunned for dues fired off this irate reply: &quot;The unmitigated gall of requesting dues for property which we are in the process of paying the mortgage on, but cannot by court order build a house on, is surpassed only by the fraudulent methods used in selling us the property.&quot;    The dues were recently cut in half, to $212.50, for those who had bought the unbuildable lots.    Wild Acres and its club now are operated by a real-estate company controlled by Marcon's chief creditors, First Eastern Bank -- a unit of First Eastern Corp. of Wilkes-Barre, Pa. -- and Midlantic Banks Inc. of Edison, N.J. John Appleton, First Eastern's outside counsel, says that when the bank took over in 1984, it had to put up its own money to keep the club running. First Eastern contends that Wild Acres property owners owe $1.1 million in club dues.    &quot;I want to know what they are doing with the dues they collect,&quot; says Nick Mastrocovi, a retired truck driver who lives in one of Wild Acres' 1,100 homes but refuses to pay dues. Residents say services have steadily declined. Grass grows through cracks in the tennis court. The ski slope's towrope is missing. Baseball bleachers have been removed. Roads need repair.    Some aggrieved owners say Parkside recently has offered to buy unbuildable lots from them, but for only a small percentage of the original purchase price. Parkside's attorney, Mr. Anders, says, &quot;If Parkside is buying in the unbuildable section, it's for speculation.&quot;    Parkside is also buying lots in buildable sections -- from owners fed up with the turmoil -- and reselling them at a large markup. One lot it acquired for $2,500 was resold to a Paterson, N.J., couple for $14,600, according to realty transfer records. Attorney Anders denies that profits are excessive. Parkside's marketing costs, he says, represent half its selling prices.    Parkside's activities were heatedly discussed at a packed meeting of the Wild Acres Property and Homeowners Association last September. Later, at 12:45 a.m., the phone rang in the home of Seymour Sattler, a director of the association.    &quot;I hear you're going to sell your house,&quot; said someone who identified himself as &quot;Mr. Brown.&quot; Mr. Sattler, a retired engineer who hasn't any intention of selling, says that he found a Parkside sign on his front lawn that night. Lenore McKenna, the association chairman, got a similar call and sign. &quot;It means one of two things,&quot; she says. &quot;Someone has a warped sense of humor. Or it's a message to get out.&quot;    Parkside neither made the calls nor left the signs, Mr. Anders says. </TEXT></DOC>
