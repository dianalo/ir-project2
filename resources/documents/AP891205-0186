To err was as human in this decade as in any, maybe more so. Askanyone who bought stocks the day before Black Monday. Ask thePentagon procurement guy who signed for that $7,622 coffeemaker.Ask Gary Hart.   Here are 20 flubs, slips, bloopers and clarifications of the'80s, some more expensive, noisy and public than others:   1. Most of the world hadn't heard of Islip, Long Island, beforeMarch 1987, when a bargeload of trash set out on a trip to alandfill. But then the seagoing junkpile was rebuffed by six statesand three nations. The Mexican Navy went on alert, and so did theAmerican T-shirt industry.   Night-by-night, Johnny Carson plotted the gar-barge'swanderings. Humorist Dave Barry envisioned it in the Persian Gulf,fighting off an Iranian attack with swarms of ``courageous flies.''   ``Islip's garbage has become the laughingstock of the EasternSeaboard,'' lamented the town's supervisor, Frank R. Jones.   2. Nobody was laughing at Coca-Cola Co. in the wake of thedecision in 1985 to reformulate the soft drink that had become themost popular in the world.   The fizz on ``new Coke'' had barely stopped tickling before thecompany came out with Coca-Cola Classic _ old stuff, new cans.   ``Biggest marketing travesty ever,'' pronounced Jesse Meyers,publisher of Beverage Digest, earlier this year.   3. Kraft Co. could claim runnerup status for its 1989 promotionoffering a snazzy $17,000 van in a cheese contest, which insteadbrought a vanload of lawsuits when a printing error made thousandsof people ``winners.'' They matched half a picture of a van in anad with the other half in a Kraft package.   The company, which ended up offering cash prizes and four vansinstead of one, figured the mistake cost $4 million.   Lawyers found a silver lining. Said one at the time: ``We havefive secretaries just taking the calls.''   4. Ever heard of ``Caboblanco?'' Somebody came up with the ideaof remaking ``Casablanca'' with Charles Bronson playing HumphreyBogart's role. The 1980 film lost an estimated $8 million.   In the same year, ``Xanadu,'' with Olivia Newton-Johnroller-skating the role of a reincarnated Greek muse, cost areported $20 million to make, grossed $11 million.   And whose idea was 1982's ``It Came from Hollywood'' _ asendup-pastiche of bad films? After costing something like $5million, ``It Came ... and Went,'' said Variety.   5. When Congress makes a mistake, fortunately it only takes avote to correct it. Take the 51 percent pay raise members proposedto give members in 1989. Constituents proposed giving memberssomething else. The House voted the measure down, 380-to-48, inFebruary 1989.   Nine months later, members held another vote, hiked pay, andcaught planes out of town.   6. Another legislative issue, regulating buttocks exposure innightclubs, hamstrung the Denver City Council. The problem was alegal definition (one proposal began, ``The area ... located aroundthe lower backbone between straight lines drawn from the outermostpoint of the pelvis ...''), not to mention the public's concernthat council members had better things to do.   In the end, they decided to sit on it.   7. In 1986, a topless doughnut shop closed after one day inTampa, Fla.   8. Rise and fall of a condiment: In 1981, ketchup brieflythought it was a vegetable. ``Somebody got overambitious in thebureaucracy,'' explained then-President Reagan after withdrawingthe Agriculture Department's school lunch regulation, equating thetwo.   9. A discount chain's television commercial in Seattle in 1986offered a stereo system for ``299 bananas.'' How many customers doyou think took it literally and got stereos for the equivalent of$40 to $60? Yup, a bunch.   10. The government of Brunei gave $10 million to help theContras fight in Nicaragua, according to congressional testimony.But in the typo of the decade, somebody hit the wrong key and theloot ended up in the Swiss account of a lucky stranger.   11. Clarification of the decade: ``I'm a comedian, not apolitician,'' said Jackie Mason, whose one-liners while working forNew York mayoral candidate Rudolph Giuliani's 1989 campaign amusedfew. Giuliani lost, and Mason's television show, ``Chicken Soup,''was canceled.   12. Elvis is NOT dead, it was learned in the late '80s. In oneof several sightings, a shopper saw him in Felpausch's grocerystore in Vicksburg, Mich. ``E.P. Call Home'' bumper stickersappeared. Incidentally, Elvis made $15 million from licensing andrecords in 1988.   13. ``Herb the Nerd'' was spotted in some Burger King ads in1986, before the fast-food chain yanked its spokes-rube and laterchanged ad agencies.   14. ``Follow me around,'' Gary Hart told reporters in 1987. Theydid. ``Let the people decide,'' the candidate said later. They did,too.   15. Retraction of the decade: In 1983, West Germany's ``Stern''magazine announced the discovery of 60 volumes of diariessupposedly written by Adolf Hitler. The forger wound up in jail.   16. Whose mistake? Millions tuned in to watch Geraldo Riveraopen a vault owned by Al Capone; it contained some empty bottles.The 1986 show was the highest-rated syndicated special in TVhistory.   17. ``Not Necessarily World News Tonight?'' In a 1989 eveningnews broadcast, two ABC employees were shown exchanging abriefcase. So what? Well, they weren't identified and the handoffvideo went with a story on an alleged briefcase exchange between aU.S. diplomat and an alleged Soviet agent. Tsk, tsk, the criticssaid of the untagged ``re-creation'' of the unproven incident. Meaculpa, said ABC.   18. Bad day of the decade for one Brooklynite: July 14, 1989.Making his getaway from a bank he had held up, the man was mugged.His ill-gotten $2,100 was stolen. There's more: He reported themugging at the 62nd Street station house. ``Only a psychiatristwould know why,'' said a spokesman for police, who charged him withrobbery.   19. Theft was the charge a year earlier, when 90 copies of TheBillings (Mont.) Gazette were snatched. Police identified theculprit as a radio personality who told them he wanted to vote forhimself in a newspaper contest asking readers to name theirfavorite broadcaster.   20. In 1988, an inmate at Mississippi State Penitentiary usedthe prison computer to start processing his early release. He endedup staying a while longer.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Weekend Editions Dec. 16-17 and Thereafter</NOTE></DOC>
