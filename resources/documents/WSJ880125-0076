Icahn, Texaco Inc.'s largest shareholder, to file an alternative plan of reorganization, making it more likely that a revamping proposed by Texaco would win shareholder approval.    Judge Howard Schwartzberg's ruling Friday came only two days after a hearing at which he listened to vehement arguments from Texaco and other parties in its bankruptcy-law proceedings, asking him to oppose Mr. Icahn's plan. The investor's proposed reorganization called for removal of Texaco's takeover defenses, which the oil concern said would make it susceptible to a hostile acquisition.    Mr. Icahn, who owns 14.5% of Texaco, has said repeatedly during the past 10 days that he would oppose Texaco's plan if his proposal were disallowed by the court. &quot;Now his bluff will be called,&quot; said Bruce Lazier, oil analyst for Prescott Ball andamp; Turben. &quot;(Mr.) Icahn would have to be a real kamikaze&quot; to destroy the Texaco plan and its settlement with Pennzoil Co., he added.    If the Texaco plan is voted down and the settlement with Pennzoil undone, Texaco would be forced to pursue an appeal of its underlying litigation with Pennzoil to the U.S. Supreme Court. &quot;Texaco's share price could tumble to $20 if it lost in the Supreme Court and (Mr.) Icahn would lose his shirt,&quot; Mr. Lazier said.    The average price for all shares purchased by Mr. Icahn exceeds $31 a share. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Texaco closed at $37.875, off 12.5 cents.    There are already signs that Mr. Icahn's resolve to oppose the Texaco plan is crumbling. &quot;If he (Mr. Icahn) determines that defeat of the Texaco plan could hurt the shareholders, he may back away from his position to oppose the plan,&quot; said an individual familiar with Mr. Icahn's strategy. &quot;Mr. Icahn feels he has the financial staying power to weather a Texaco defeat in the Supreme Court, but many other shareholders would be ruined.&quot;    But a turnaround by Mr. Icahn doesn't necessarily mean that he would vote in favor of Texaco's plan. Mr. Icahn could continue to support the principle of &quot;corporate democracy,&quot; and just abstain from voting. &quot;It's something he's looking at,&quot; the same source said.    Added David Friedman, Mr. Icahn's bankruptcy counsel: &quot;We're in the process of evaluating all options including an appeal&quot; of Judge Schwartzberg's ruling.    But Harvey Miller, Texaco's bankruptcy counsel, doesn't believe that an appeal would succeed. &quot;It's a solid ruling,&quot; Mr. Miller said. &quot;Mr. Icahn's case just failed to prove anything.&quot;    Texaco filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in April to forestall enforcement of a $10.3 billion judgment rendered by a Texas court. That court ordered Texaco to pay Pennzoil the multibillion-dollar amount because it said Texaco had improperly interfered with Pennzoil's acquisition of a portion of Getty Oil Co. Texaco and Pennzoil settled their four-year-old legal battle last month for $3 billion.    The judge also struck down a lawsuit in which Mr. Icahn called illegal a so-called &quot;hidden&quot; agreement in which Texaco and Pennzoil pledged that neither would support any reorganization plan other than the one they had jointly filed.    The company would like to rid itself of Mr. Icahn's influence for good. Top Texaco management would like to see Mr. Icahn's stake sold to a party friendly to the oil giant, said a source close to Texaco. And it is considering canvassing the market for any interested buyers. Texaco may also ask potential buyers of assets the company needs to shed as part of its restructuring to consider purchasing Mr. Icahn's stock as well. Theoretically, the buyer would agree to keep the Texaco stock in its treasury for some specified period of time, the same source said. </TEXT></DOC>
