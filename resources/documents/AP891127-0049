So much snow fell in Utah that a World Cup ski race waspostponed.   The snow delighted early-season recreational skiers but sentcars skidding off roads and into each other, prompted someavalanche warnings and caused power outages.   Icy roads were blamed for car crashes that killed three peoplein Montana on Sunday. Some schools were closed in Minnesota today.   Interstate highways and smaller roads were closed at timesduring the weekend, causing major traffic jams as Thanksgivingholiday travelers tried to return home.   I-80 over Donner Summit at Truckee, Calif., was closed fornearly 10 hours into early Sunday, and the California HighwayPatrol reported traffic delays of three to four hours through thepass later in the day. The National Weather Service said the stormdumped 13 inches of snow on Donner Summit on Friday and another 38inches Saturday and early Sunday.   In Utah, World Cup officials determined that conditions were toodangerous for men's slalom races Sunday at Park City, which gotnearly two feet of snow by nightfall.   But the snow meant other ski areas were able to open.   ``There's an awful lot of (snow) out there. It's a welcomesight,'' said Angela Gaines, an Alta Ski Lift employee. Alta had 26inches of snow by Sunday night.   However, the Utah Avalanche Forecast Center issued an avalanchewarning for the mountains around Salt Lake City, Provo and ParkCity.   In addition to snow, the storm also yielded two funnel cloudsand 50-60 mph winds in southern Davis County in Utah, butauthorities reported no damage or injuries. High winds also wereblamed for power interruptions in Utah's Santa Clara County.   In Montana on Sunday, three people died in crashes on icy roads,while passengers in about 1,000 cars and trucks on I-90 betweenBozeman and Livingston were stuck in a traffic jam 10 miles long,the state highway patrol said. The patrol temporarily closed thehighway's westbound lanes.   The storm moved east today, piling up heavy snow in Colorado'snorthern and central mountains and in the western Dakotas.   ``Near blizzard conditions, that's what it's like in the westernDakotas,'' Karl Swanberg, a meteorologist with the National WeatherService in Minneapolis, said early today.   ``It's gusting 50 mph, producing near zero visibility'' aroundRapid City, S.D., Swanberg said.   No snowfall estimates were available early today. ``It's hard tomeasure when it's blowing around like that,'' he said.   Temperatures were expected to drop into the low teens and asmany as 8 inches of snow were forecast for northwestern Minnesotaand eastern North Dakota.   All Moorhead, Minn., schools canceled classes today after thearea got four inches of snow during the night. Two- to 3-footsnowdrifts were common, said meteorologist Bob Nordlund of theNational Weather Service in Fargo, N.D.   In the Pacific Northwest, the storm dumped snow in most ofOregon's mountains. Two of the state's largest ski resorts _Timberline Lodge on Mount Hood and Mount Bachelor ski area incentral Oregon _ opened Sunday.   ``If you open before Thanksgiving, that means a great year. Nowwe're going to have to settle for a good year,'' said GaryHohnstein, assistant general manager of Timberline Lodge, where twoof five chairlifts opened Sunday. But that was three days too latefor a resort that relies on sales up to $50,000 a day during theholiday weekend.</TEXT></DOC>
