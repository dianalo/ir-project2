Congress _ ittakes so long to get anything done. The State Department _ theyanalyze everything to death,'' Rivkind says.   Not so with Perry Abbott Rivkind.   With a dozen Nicaraguans set for deportation three years ago,Rivkind refused to send them back ``to a cowardly communistgovernment.''   Thus, Miami became the first immigration district to stopdeporting Nicaraguans while the U.S.-supported Contra rebels werefighting a guerrilla war.   Rivkind today says he had been told the Justice Departmentplanned to change the policy. Of course, when Attorney General EdwinMesse III acted, the policy already was a year old in Miami.   Jervis said Rivkind may not always follow channels, but ``hisjudgment has generally been pretty good.''   Rivkind, who counts presidential son Jeb Bush among his closefriends, admits he's not a team player, and unlike many bureaucraticcolleagues doesn't spend a lot of time worrying about possiblenegative reactions to his decisions.   ``After so many years in government, so many agencies, so manyexperiences _ I've been to 75 countries under the Nixonadministration training foreign narcotics agents _ you don't reactto events, you handle them. You make decisions with ease, withoutoverreacting, without worrying.''   Some examples:   _When two groups of young Cubans came ashore three years ago,Rivkind immediately granted them asylum and brought them up to his11th-floor office for a news conference to talk about the terriblestate of affairs under Castro.   _When Everglades brush fires sent coarse smoke billowing acrossdowntown Miami in April, most Miamians closed their windows andcomplained. Rivkind closed the INS building, then evacuated theKrome detention center.   For a while, he was telling television crews he was trying tohire enough buses to ship all of the more than 700 aliens,three-fourths of them Haitian, to Texas INS centers. That alarmedHaitians in Miami and surprised INS officials in Texas. After anight at Miami's baseball stadium, the aliens were back in Krome.   _When Florida's lottery made a Nicaraguan a millionaire recently,questions were raised about his immigration status. With the winnerapparently in hiding, Rivkind granted him asylum.   Rivkind's decisions can seem hasty to some, given the nationaland international implications.   Some people wondered whether the Cubans had demonstrated awell-founded fear of persecution, as required for political asylum,but Rivkind said they certainly would be persecuted if they werereturned to their ``perverted, pathological'' government.   Haitians who get here in dangerously overcrowded boats can bereturned, Rivkind says, because they don't face persecution at home.In fact, he believes the Haitian government actively encouragesHaitians to go to the United States to get jobs for pay they cansend home to relatives.   As for the Nicaraguan Lotto millionaire, Rivkind says he deservedasylum because of the persecution threat. After all, Rivkind joked,he's now a capitalist and the Sandinista government persecutescapitalists.   The Krome detention center, a converted Nike missile base on theedge of the Everglades, is a symbol of INS abuse to exile activistssuch as Jean-Juste. Rivkind visits frequently, eats lunch with thedetainees at least once a week, but says he is required by law tohold undocumented aliens there pending exclusion proceedings.   ``Rivkind so managed to distance himself from the arrogant agencyhe works for that he was like the Reagan of immigration, the TeflonINS man,'' says Robert Boyer, an attorney who presses Nicaraguanimmigration claims.   Rivkind, who claims unconvincingly to be surprised and flatteredthat a reporter wants to visit him, is ready with a thick pile ofnewspaper clippings and even family scrapbooks featuring his latefather, Sam, a semi-pro basketball player and pioneering Miami Beachhotelier. Perry's older brother, Lawrence, is a Dade Circuit Courtjudge.   Amid all the photos of Rivkind with Reagan, Bush, Nixon andothers, there hangs a framed photo of an idyllic scene, a placidriver lined with trees and mountains near Roanoke, Va.   That's where he'll be a year from now, says the divorced fatherof two. He'll be relaxing, enjoying retirement.   But he'd like to do some college teaching and maybe hit thelecture circuit talking about immigration law and ``my favoritesubject _ me,'' he says, laughing.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, July 9</NOTE></DOC>
