Jim Wright's financial disclosurestatement, released on the eve of a crucial hearing into hisalleged rules violations, touches only lightly if at all on moneydeals that led the ethics committee to charge the House speaker.   Mallightco, the investment partnership that sparked many of the69 ethics charges against the Texas Democat, is mentioned but once_ in the liabilities section with the notation that a loan was``satisfied during 1988.''   Wright made no mention of royalties from his book, ``Reflectionsof a Public Man.'' The ethics committee has accused Wright of a``scheme to evade'' outside income limits by selling the bookpreviously.   There is one brief mention of Jewell Enterprises, a company thatwent under after disastrous nursing home investments, causingWright and other investors a substantial loss. The speaker listedstock in the bankrupt company as an asset worth less than $5,000.''   The ethics committee was scheduled to hold an unusual televisedhearing on Tuesday on Wright's longshot motion to dismiss the mostserious charges against him, as the speaker sought a badly neededvictory to counter a losing public relations battle.   Stephen Susman, a hard-nosed Houston lawyer brought in thismonth to bolster Wright's legal defense, will take the lead role inthe hearing and spent Monday preparing his case. Susman is expectedto argue that the ethics committee stretched House rules beyondtheir intended meaning when it charged Wright with 69 violations.   The panel's special outside counsel, Richard J. Phelan ofChicago, will defend the committee's interpretation of the rules. Aruling on the motion to dismiss charges was expected later thisweek.   Wright, who has often owed substantial amounts, used 1988 towork his way out of debt _ listing no liabilities at yearend,according to the statement released Monday along with those ofother House members.   His income was between $188,183 and $203,579 and his assetsranged from $31,005-$100,000. These figures, however, do notinclude holdings in a blind trust established by Wright in 1987.Those figures were not available.   Wright paid off debts totaling between $105,000 and $220,000,including money he owed to Mallightco and a bank. The specialcounsel to the ethics committee said Wright satisfied these noteswith money he made from his share of an oil and gas investment thatis still under investigation by the panel.   The speaker earned $170,000 as his share of the deal, his mostprofitable financial transaction. Mallightco bought and later soldits interest in the prospective Sabine Lake oil and gas well alongthe Texas-Louisiana line. The well turned up dry. There was notrace of the deal on the disclosure form.   Mallightco was owned by Wright, his wife, Betty, their partnerGeorge Mallick, and Mallick's wife _ until the speaker pulled outof the partnership last year. The ethics committee said there was``reason to believe'' Wright received gifts from Mallick who,according to the panel, had a direct interest in legislation.   The disclosure showed Wright received between $5,001 and $15,000in oil and gas royalties from Southeastern Resources in 1988.   As in previous years, he held 57 acres of land in Van Buren,Ark., valued at $5,001-$15,000, and real estate in Prince GeorgesCounty, Md., worth between $15,001 and $50,000.   Wright's use of the Sabine Lake profits to satisfy his debtsleft him with fewer assets than a decade ago. The speaker's 1978disclosure form showed holdings of between $72,000 and $170,000.   Meanwhile, Wright's defense against the ethics charges will bethat the rules were changed in midstream.   Wright's lawyers are expected to argue Tuesday that the two mostserious sets of charges should be dismissed because the panel,reacting to a new moral climate, has stretched the rules beyondtheir original intent.   But his lawyers concede such motions are routinely denied, andthey give the speaker less than an even chance of winning apreemptive dismissal of the charges.</TEXT></DOC>
