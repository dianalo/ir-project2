Nearly $1.9 billion in loans were guaranteed by theAgriculture Department under its commodity export creditprograms. With Iraq currently in default, the governmentstands to lose $347 million on those loans. Some of the moneyis believed to have paid for Iraqi purchases of technologyessential to Saddam Hussein's military buildup in the late1980s.</LP><TEXT>   The 347-count indictment, returned yesterday by a federalgrand jury in Atlanta, also named four Iraqi governmentofficials and a bank owned by the Iraqi government.   The indictment charges that the Atlanta branch officialsconspired to defraud the bank by lending money and extendingcredit to Iraq without authorization. The loans and creditsalso violated U.S. and Italian lending limits and weren'tproperly recorded by the bank, the indictment charges. Theindictment also states that the Atlanta branch officialsmisled federal and state banking regulators, as well asItalian authorities, in a scheme to conceal the unauthorizedtransactions.   Defendants included Christopher Drogoul, former manager ofthe Atlanta branch of Banca Nazionale del Lavoro; ThereseBarden, the branch's operations officer; Amedeo Decarolis,former operations assistant; Iraqi banking officials SadikHasson Taha and Abdul Munim Rasheed; and Raja Hassan Ali andSafa Haji Al-Habobi, officials with the Iraqi Ministry ofIndustry and Military Production. The Iraqis were chargedwith conspiracy, fraud and money laundering.   The parent bank wasn't named as a defendant, but Italianauthorities are investigating whether BNL's top managementwas negligent in failing to discover the unauthorizedactivities of its Atlanta branch. BNL's chairman and generalmanager have resigned over the scandal, which first receivedpublic attention in August 1989.   U.S. Attorney General Richard Thornburgh, at a newsconference here, wouldn't respond directly to reporters'questions about whether officials in the Reagan and Bushadministrations were aware of the loans to Iraq. He saidprosecutors have &quot;no evidence whatsoever&quot; that U.S. officialshad engaged in any wrongdoing in connection with the loans,but he stressed that prosecutors had investigated onlyalleged violations of law. &quot;We aren't a general investigativeagency,&quot; he added. The loans came at a time when the U.S. wastrying to beef up Iraq's military as a buffer to Iran.   Mr. Thornburgh said that &quot;possible violations of {U.S.}law in connection with the acquisition by Iraq of militaryarmaments and other goods remain under investigation.&quot;   In addition to farm sales to Iraq, the indictment says thefinancing of a sale of Cuban sugar to Venezuela involved aviolation by Mr. Drogoul of the Trading with the Enemy Act.The sale was made by Cargill International S.A. of Geneva,Switzerland, the main trading arm of Minneapolis-basedCargill Inc. Neither Cargill International nor Cargill Inc.were named as defendants.   Mr. Drogoul, along with two subordinates, allegedlyarranged the loans and credit for Iraq and then made falsestatements to conceal their actions from regulatory officialsand the parent bank. The indictment charged that theofficials kept secret &quot;gray books&quot; on the Iraqi financing,apart from the bank's official records.   The BNL officials allegedly received gifts and money aspayment for their participation in the transactions. Mr.Thornburgh declined to comment on whether the defendants hadany other motives for arranging the loans.   Mr. Drogoul couldn't be reached for comment. A spokeswomanfor Theodore Lackland, an Atlanta lawyer who until veryrecently had represented the defendant, said the attorney &quot;nolonger represents Mr. Drogoul&quot; and declined to elaborate.   Eugene Medori, a lawyer for Ms. Barden, said his client&quot;maintains she is not guilty of any criminal acts inconnection with her employment with BNL.&quot;   Glenn Delk, a lawyer for Mr. Decarolis said, &quot;My client isgoing to plead not guilty, and . . . hopefully we can provethat.&quot;   Mr. Drogoul was arrested yesterday in Atlanta, and arrestwarrants have been issued for the other defendants, Mr.Thornburgh said.   Mr. Thornburgh said prosecutors would seek the extraditionof the Iraqi defendants, but other officials acknowledged itis highly unlikely that the Iraqis would ever be turned over.Iraq said last year that one of the defendants, Mr. Taha, haddied. U.S. prosecutors have said the report was false.   If convicted, the individual defendants face maximumprison terms of 15 years or more and fines of hundreds ofthousands of dollars. The indictment was the result of an18-month investigation.   Also charged in the indictment were Rafidain Bank, theprincipal Iraqi government-owned commercial bank, which actedas the borrower of the BNL loans; Entrade International Ltd.,a New York trading company that allegedly helped obtain theloans; and Entrade Executive Vice President Yavus Tezeller.All three of these defendants were charged with fraudulentlyparticipating in the issuing and concealment of theunauthorized BNL loans.   Entrade's president, Kenan Atabay, declined to comment onthe charges. Mr. Tezeller, a Turkish national, is believed tobe in that country and couldn't be reached for comment.   Rome-based BNL yesterday depicted itself as the victim ofa &quot;complex fraud scheme&quot; perpetrated by &quot;unfaithful Atlantaemployees and other collaborators.&quot; The bank said that thecommodity and other sales to Iraq, financed by unauthorizedextensions of credit in Atlanta, were &quot;apparently notprohibited by U.S. government policy at the time.&quot;   In Minneapolis, a Cargill spokesman said the company hasreviewed the sugar sale and &quot;we remain convinced that therewasn't any violation of law on our part.&quot; The spokesman addedthat the government didn't make any specific allegationsagainst Cargill.   ---   Bruce Ingersoll contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
