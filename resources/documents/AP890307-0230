Another can't always rememberher children's ages. And a third likens her mood swings to a``roller coaster, up and down.''   The aerospace employees all told a Senate panel Monday theysuffered chronic physical and mental illness from exposure tohazardous chemicals.   An official for Boeing Co., which employed two of the workers,said the company was concerned for the safety of employees exposedto hazardous chemicals, but the chairman of the Senate Environmentsubcommittee on toxic substances, Harry Reid, rebuked the aerospacecompany.   The Nevada Democrat said he felt Boeing was ``minimizing'' theeffects that hazardous materials can have on workers by pleadingignorance to the danger and emphasizing disagreements in the medicalcommunity.   Boeing's vice president for human resources, Joseph Peritore,told the subcommittee there was no evidence to link an acidic resinformerly used by the company with workers' health problems.   Peritore said the company nonetheless, out of concern forworkers' health, discontinued use of the material even though it was``determined that the material presented no significant healthhazard.''   Peritore said Boeing ``not only met, but significantly exceeded''regulatory standards, and testified that the medical community wasdivided.   ``The fact that we believed the material was safe becameirrelevant,'' said Peritore. ``In the highly charged atmosphere thatexisted, we felt the only way to alleviate our employees' concernswas to remove the material from the shop altogether. And we did.''   One witness, Deborah Forbes-Sutherland, 39, of Westlake Village,Calif., said she began working 16 years ago for J.S. Switzer, acompany that distributes aerospace chemicals.   Telling the panel she almost died a year ago, Ms.Forbes-Sutherland said that when asked by customers if the chemicalswere safe, she unwittingly told them, ``Yes, if you don't eat themon your breakfast cereal. I lied to those people.''   Former Boeing employee Bonnie Faye Schrum, of Renton, Wash., saidchemical exposure caused her co-workers to pass out, vomit, act asif they were drunk at work and feel like ``their head was going toexplode.''   ``We were discouraged from reporting this'' to the companymedical department, she testified, and said workers were threatenedwith dismissal after complaining. ``You either worked with thesechemicals or you did not have a job,'' she said.   ``I'm not the same person I was five years ago,'' she testified.``I can't pump gas. I can't go to the grocery store without gettingsick. I can't sleep at night, I can't eat, I have no energy. I don'tknow my kids, I don't know their ages.''   Beverly McCormick, of North Bend, Wash., said she becamedisoriented from exposure to chemicals at Boeing, and once got lostwhile ``driving down a highway I drove every day.''   Lori Liberty, of Encino, Calif., who appeared at the hearingwearing gloves, said she was ``poisoned'' by chemicals while workingat Lockheed in Burbank, Calif., and has been unable to work for twoyears.   Ms. Liberty, 33, said she has suffered from severe headaches,impaired speech, bleeding fingers, nails that fall off, and moodsthat were ``like a roller coaster, up and down.''   Afraid to have children because she's worried about birthdefects, Ms. Liberty told senators she takes 14 to 20 tablets dailyfor her various ailments, including medicine for depression, andsees specialists ranging from psychiatrists to a toxicologist.   ``I don't think I can ever go back to the job I enjoyed,'' shesaid, blaming the company for improper ventilation, failure to warnworkers of dangers, a lack of protective devices, and using her as a``guinea pig'' to try out new chemicals while tubes were attached toher to measure exposure.   She contended the company threatened to fire her when shecomplained.   Dale H. Daniels, executive vice president for LockheedAeronautical Systems Co., said the company ``recognizes that rawmaterials and processes in the workplace pose potential healththreats.''   However, he added, ``When employees are properly trained andutilize the proper protective equipment, together with adequateengineering controls, the employees can work safely.''</TEXT></DOC>
