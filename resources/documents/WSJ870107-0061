The dollar, meanwhile, fell as speculators sold the U.S. currency for marks on the expectation that the West German currency would be revalued upward as the cornerstone of an EMS realignment.    With the franc weakened by growing labor unrest in France, the mark shot up to its highest permissible level against the French currency after the Bank of France told foreign-exchange traders that it wouldn't intervene to prevent the West German currency's advance.    By standing aside, French officials apparently hope to force West Germany to ease strains within the EMS by lowering its interest rates or by revaluing the mark upward against most EMS currencies. That would allow the French to avoid a devaluation of the franc, which would reflect unfavorably on a government already perceived by some to be weakening in the face of labor-union resistance.    West Germany has been resisting such actions ahead of a national election there on Jan. 25, but yesterday's developments may force its hand.    The French central bank sold a small amount of marks at a level of 3.3120 francs at yesterday's Paris foreign-exchange fixing, but later said it wouldn't attempt to keep the mark from rising above that level, traders said. The mark then climbed to its ceiling in late trading. Under the current EMS structure, the mark isn't allowed to rise above 3.3303 francs.    The franc's weakness yesterday stemmed in part from an escalation of labor-union resistance to the conservative French government's tough economic policies. Unions staged electricity cuts throughout France, halved the traffic on the Paris subway and bus systems and disrupted postal service, while the 20-day-old rail strike continued without any end in sight.    The Communist-dominated Confederation Generale du Travail and the Socialist-leaning Confederation Francaise Democratique du Travail said they would continue the mass-transit and electricity actions today. The electricity cuts could become even more severe, as talks between management and unions over wage increases for 1987 collapsed last night.    Prime Minister Jacques Chirac asserted that he wouldn't give in to the unions because that would threaten the country's economic recovery.    Against this background, France hopes to avoid a devaluation of the franc, which would be considered an unfavorable comment on its economic policies and could add to inflationary expectations in the midst of the growing dispute over wages. Economics Minister Edouard Balladur yesterday reiterated that &quot;a devaluation of the French franc is totally excluded.&quot;    The Bank of France has been supporting the franc by pushing domestic interest rates higher. It also has intervened moderately in the foreign-exchange market but doesn't wish to deplete its foreign-exchange reserves to fight what it sees as speculative pressure on the franc. So it has increased pressure on the West Germans to act.    &quot;It is a mark crisis, and not a franc crisis, and the German authorities should do what is necessary,&quot; Mr. Chirac said. And a French monetary official said that West Germany &quot;should either lower its interest rates or accept its monetary responsibilities.&quot;    The EMS exchange-rate mechanism obligates the eight member countries to intervene in the foreign-exchange market to keep their currencies within agreed-upon bands against one another. A country also can raise or lower interest rates to help keep its currency within the bands. If those steps aren't successful, a nation can request a realignment of the bands.    With the mark at its ceiling against the franc, the West Germans are obligated to take part in foreign-exchange intervention to restrain their currency. That could become an expensive proposition, especially since the other EMS currencies that would be purchased with marks in such an operation would decline in value immediately upon any realignment.    To remedy this situation, the West Germans basically have two options -- to revalue the mark upward or to lower interest rates. The German government had hoped to avoid a revaluation of the mark before the Jan. 25 elections, since an increase in the mark's exchange value makes West German exports less competitive. A tougher export market could cost the ruling party votes in the elections.    Lower West German interest rates would weaken the mark by making investments in the currency less attractive. A weaker mark would allow the current EMS alignment to be maintained, at least temporarily. In effect, such a move could buy the West German government time, putting off the need for a revaluation of the mark until after the election.    But West German authorities have firmly resisted lowering interest rates out of concern that such a move would spark higher inflation by contributing to already strong monetary growth.    Some traders who expect the West Germans to resist an EMS realignment until after the election said they expect France to raise its interest rates again to ease pressure on the franc. But yesterday's statements by French officials clearly indicate the French are expecting West Germany to make the next move.    West German government sources in Bonn yesterday said a realignment of the EMS is unlikely in the next few days. The sources, who didn't want to be identified, also said no emergency meeting of finance ministers or other key officials of the EMS was planned at the moment.    Whether it comes soon or after the West German election, an EMS realignment is a foregone conclusion, according to Michael A. Gotthelf, vice president of foreign exchange at Berliner Handels andamp; Frankfurter Bank, New York. Besides the timing, the only question is how much of an adjustment will be made between the currencies, he says.    Mr. Gotthelf expects the mark to be revalued upward by 3%, along with a 2% devaluation of the French, Italian, Danish and Belgian currencies and a slightly larger devaluation of the Irish punt. The currencies of the Netherlands and Luxembourg most likely will be left unchanged, he believes.    Speculation about such a realignment hurt the dollar yesterday as some traders sold the U.S. currency to buy the West German currency before its value increases. In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar stood at 1.9183 marks, down from 1.9303 Monday. The U.S. currency also fell to 158.81 Japanese yen from 159.25. The British pound climbed to $1.4795 from $1.4710.    In early trading in Tokyo Wednesday the dollar fell against the Japanese currency to 158.27 yen from 158.81 in New York yesterday afternoon.    The French government's problems, meanwhile, don't appear to be on the verge of resolution. As in the rail strike, the strikes in other public services are largely motivated by the government's tough guidelines on wage increases in the public sector.    Mr. Chirac accused the Communist Party and the Confederation Generale du Travail of &quot;politicizing&quot; the strikes to &quot;torpedo and destabilize the government.&quot; Mr. Chirac also accused President Francois Mitterrand of fanning the fire by receiving a delegation of striking rail workers last week. Mr. Chirac said the president was straying from his role as &quot;an arbiter&quot; and venturing into partisan politics.    ---                        CURRENCY RATES                          New York    Home Mkt.
