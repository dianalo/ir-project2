As workers shoveled charred debris into bins Saturday andengineers assessed damage to the fire-gutted U.S. consulate,diplomats asked themselves what was behind the outbreak ofbitterness that left five people dead and caused millions ofdollars of damage.   Honduras receives more than $300 million a year in U.S. aid,hosts military maneuvers involving thousands of U.S. troops and hasbeen the staunchest supporter of Washington's Nicaragua policy,which has involved funding the Contra rebels. For many years, theinsurgents had bases in Honduras.   ``North Americans in Latin America are elephants in a crystalshop,'' a South American ambassador in Central America told TheAssociated Press Friday night, 24 hours after a mob of nearly 2,000people attacked the U.S. Embassy complex in Tegucigalpa, capital ofHonduras.   ``I don't have a bone of anti-Americanism in me,'' said theenvoy, who has served in several Latin American nations and spokeon condition he not be further identified. ``But I can't understandwhy, when they (the Americans) have all these problems in theregion _ Panama, Nicaragua _ they create another one i Honduras byacting arrogantly.''   He referred to the arrest Tuesday of Juan Ramon Matta, analleged drug lord long wanted in the United States.   On Tuesday, Honduran officials took Matta from his Tegucigalpahome in a pre-dawn raid and hustled him onto a plane to theDominican Republic without a passport.   Dominican officials put Matta on a New York-bound flight and hewas arrested aboard the jetliner by U.S. marshals, according toU.S. law enforcement officials.   Matta, held at the maximum-security federal prison in Marion,Ill., was wanted by U.S. officials for questioning in the 1985slaying in Mexico of a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent,Enrique Camarena Salazar.   Honduran legislators angrily called the incident a``kidnapping'' and the Foreign Ministry launched an investigation.   The Honduran Constitution prohibits the extradition of citizens.   The move raised a storm of protest, much of it from groupsoutside the small Honduran Marxist left, which blasts the UnitedStates as a matter of course.   The daily newspaper El Tiempo said in an editorial, ``In lessthan a month, Honduras has been moved to indignation by two events,which affected national dignity, integrity and sovereignty.   ``In both cases, the offense has come from the United States ... The events show that the Honduran nation does not exist becauseits authorities carry out the orders of another state and negatetheir own institutions.''   Besides the Matta case, the paper referred to the dispatch toHonduras last month of 3,200 U.S. troops in response to a reportedincursion by Nicaraguan forces into Honduras. The government ofPresident Jose Azcona asked for the support, but Hondurancongressmen complained they were not consulted.   Oswaldo Ramos Soto, rector of the National University inTegucigalpa, said of Matta's arrest, ``I think drug smugglersshould be captured and tried. But the extradition of Matta meansthat our constitution has been flagrantly violated. The UnitedStates has created with this incident a situation that will betaken advantage of by communists in our country.''   Azcona's government, as well as the U.S. Embassy, contend theinfuriated mob that set fire to the consulate is a tiny minority ofMarxist subversives. Police said four men and a woman died ofgunshot wounds during the riot.   They said privately contracted Honduran guards, who take overguard duty from U.S. Marines at night, fired into the mob withshotguns.   But an embassy spokesman, commenting on condition of anonymity,denied that any personnel under contract to the mission opened fire.   The spokesman rejected the suggestion that there was anti-U.S.feeling in Honduras about to explode.   ``That (Thursday night) was a small, misguided group that doesnot represent the great majority of the Honduran people,'' he said.   He said, however, that the ferocity of the reaction to Matta'sextradition was ``somewhat surprising.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Douglas Grant Mine writes about Central Americanevents for The Associated Press from his base in El Salvador.
