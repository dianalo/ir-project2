Section701.20 sets forth the requirements for surety bond coverage for lossescaused by credit union employees and officials and for general insurancecoverage for losses caused by persons outside of the credit union (e.g.,losses due to theft, vandalism). The amendment requires a provision inFCU bonds assuring that a surety notify the NCUA Board whenever bond coverageof a federally insured credit union is terminated in its entirety, or whenit is terminated on an individual employee or official.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>May 1, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>National Credit Union Administration, 1776 G Street,NW., Washington, DC 20456.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Robert Fenner, General Counsel,or Allan Meltzer, Assistant General Counsel, at the above address, or telephone(202) 682-9630.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>On October 13, 1988, the NCUA Boardrequested comment on a proposal to require that credit union bonds includea provision requiring that the NCUA be notified whenever: (1) Bond coverageon a federally insured credit union in its entirety is terminated; and(2) bond coverage on an employee, director, officer, supervisory or creditcommittee member is terminated. (<T3>See </T3>53 FR 41610, October 24, 1988). In addition to requestingcomment on the proposed change itself, the proposed rule invited commenton the following specific issues. First, should the regulation be madeapplicable to federally-insured, state-chartered credit unions? Second,what use should be made of the information received, i.e. should the informationbe used internally, be given to other government agencies, or be made availableto the credit union community as a whole? Third, would dissemination ofthis information be considered a ``Routine use'' under the provisions ofthe Privacy Act?A total of twenty-seven comments on various aspects of the proposal werereceived. Nineteen were from federal credit unions, one from a state-chartered,federally insured credit union, three from credit union leagues, two fromnational credit union trade associations, one from a surety bond company,and one from a surety trade association.Commenters were overwhelmingly in favor of the proposal. Twenty-two commentersfavored this proposed change, three opposed it, one approved it with reservations,and two failed to explicitly state their position but took the opportunityto comment on various aspects of the proposal. Of nineteen FCU's commenting,16 favored the change, one favored it with qualifications, one opposedit, and one essentially took no position but requested other changes inthe surety bond regulation. One Federally insured, state chartered creditunion commented and favored the change. Three leagues commented favorably.One trade association favored the change, and one opposed it. The suretytrade association opposes the change.Those commenters who support the change did so generally because they feltsuch notification would allow the NCUA to identify and prevent potentiallosses to the Insurance Fund, and that it might in some cases reduce arisk to the Fund.Interestingly, no commenter mentioned another, perhaps more significantpurpose of the proposal, which is to assure compliance with the statutoryproscription against individuals without bond coverage serving as officersor employees.Those few commenters opposing the amendment did so for a variety of reasons.Three commenters, one of them a credit union, felt that the ``burden''of providing notification should fall upon the credit union itself, ratherthan the surety. However, as noted in the proposed rule, ``in a small butsignificant number of cases involving termination as to an individual,the employee or official has been allowed to continue serving as beforeeither because the officials were unaware that this continued service wascontrary to the FCU Act and NCUA regulations, or because they believedsuch termination was wrongful.'' The suggested alternative of these commenterswould not be helpful in these situations, and not aid in monitoring compliancewith law.One commenter suggested that the amendment would be an onerous burden uponsureties. Many credit unions commented, and the Board agrees, that theburden, if any, is substantially outweighed by the potential benefit tothe Insurance Fund. Moreover, while it is not a regulatory requirement,contractual provisions already in use in credit union bonds require thatthe NCUA be notified when the bond of a federal credit union as a wholeis terminated. Indeed, this termination is not effective until the NCUAreceives such a notice. This current bond provision does not appear tohave presented an onerous burden upon sureties, nor have there ever beenany complaints about it or requests from sureties or credit unions thatthe provision be modified or deleted.Commenters also addressed the three specific issues upon which commentswere solicited. As noted in the proposed rule, because andSection; 741.1of the NCUA Rules and Regulations establishes the requirements of andSection;701.20 as minimum standards for all federally-insured credit unions, theproposed rule as written may be applicable in the case of state chartered,federally insured credit unions. Seventeen commenters specifically addressedthis issue. Twelve favored leaving the proposed rule as-is, while fivesuggested that it be limited to federally chartered credit unions.Those who support application to state-chartered credit unions generallyfelt that, if notification from surety in the case of federally charteredcredit unions might have a beneficial impact upon the Insurance Fund, thesame benefits would be derived from notification in the case of state chartered,federally insured credit unions. In addition, the Insurance Fund's interestsas an insurer in such information is no less significant in the case ofa state chartered credit union than in a federally chartered credit union.Those who opposed the provision's possible application to state charteredcredit unions did so for two basic reasons. First, they thought that, whetheror not to require such notification in the case of a state chartered creditunion should be a matter left to the state supervisory authorities. TheBoard would note, however, that requiring notice to the state, as wellas the requirement in the proposed rule, are not mutually exclusive. Eachstate is still free to require that surety bond forms require such notificationor any other notification it deems warranted from a supervisory and regulatorystandpoint.Other commenters objected to the proposal's possible application to statechartered federally insured credit unions because they felt that determiningin the case of a state chartered credit union which ones were federallyinsured would be an onerous paperwork burden, given the potential numberof times such terminations occur in a year. The Board does not howeverbelieve this will be an onerous burden. Listings of federally insured creditunions are available to all sureties who require them. In addition, severalcommenters suggested that sureties concerned that they will not be ableto determine which of their insured's are federally insured could requirethem, as part of the insuring process, to inform them of their insuringentity. Moreover, no penalty attaches to a surety who, while acting ingood faith, neglects to provide the required notification.There was little agreement among the commenters as to the appropriate useof the information gathered. Some believed it should only be used internally.Several believed it should be given to the other federal banking regulatoryagencies. Some even thought that it should be made available to the generalpublic and credit unions.The Board notes that the primary purpose of the amendment is to protectthe fund and to assure regulatory compliance. To this extent general, regular,and routine dissemination of the information outside the agency would notaccomplish this task. Nevertheless, there may be occasions on a case bycase basis where dissemination outside the agency would be warranted. TheBoard will address this ``routine use'' of the information in a futureNotice of Publication of Systems of Records.After careful consideration of the comments, the Board has determined thatthe final rule will remain as proposed with two minor changes. First, inorder to allow a sufficient amount of time to make necessary changes inapproved bond forms, the effective date has been changed to January 1,1990. Second, the final amendment now explicitly states that notificationfrom surety must be made to the ``Secretary of the <T3>NCUA</T3> Board'' rather than the ``Secretary of the Board''.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Procedures</ITAG>Regulatory Flexibility ActThe NCUA Board has determined and certified that the final rule will nothave a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small creditunions (primarily those under $1 million in assets). The rule will notimpose an additional burden upon credit unions. Accordingly, the Boardhas determined that a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required.Paperwork Reduction ActThis rule would impose two paperwork requirements. Bonding companies wouldneed to add an additional provision in their bond forms, and, pursuantto this provision, each bonding company would need to report terminationsto the NCUA Board. It seems likely that these requirements will affectless than ten surety bond companies; therefore, the requirements of thePaperwork Reduction Act do not apply.Executive Order 12612While andSection; 701.20 applies only to Federal credit unions, andSection;741.1 establishes the requirements of andSection; 701.20 as minimum standardsfor all federally-insured credit unions. Thus, this rule may affect state-chartered,federally-insured credit unions. The NCUA Board, pursuant to ExecutiveOrder 12612, has determined, however, that the proposed amendment willnot have a substantial direct effect on the states, on the relationshipbetween the national government and the states, or on the distributionof power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Further,while the proposed amendment may affect state-chartered, federally-insuredcredit unions, it will not preempt provisions of state law or regulation.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 701</ITAG>Credit unions, Fidelity bond, Insurance coverage, Bond forms.<ITAG tagnum="21">By the National Credit Union Administration Board on April 21, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Becky Baker,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Secretary of the Board.</ITAG>Accordingly, NCUA amends its regulations as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 701_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
