(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A judge Wednesday granted surrogate motherMary Beth Whitehead-Gould unsupervised visits once a week with thechild she bore under a $10,000 contract and urged a truce in theBaby M legal battle.   Both sides said they won't appeal the ruling by Superior CourtJudge Birger M. Sween, bringing to a close a court fight thatsparked worldwide debate on parental rights and reproductivetechnology.   Sween held that 2-year-old Melissa Stern, originally dubbed BabyM in court papers, will not suffer emotionally by seeing Mrs.Whitehead-Gould for one six-hour visit a week. He said the schedulewill be expanded over the next year to include overnight stays,some holidays and two weeks in the summer of 1989.   ``She and her mother have the right to develop their own specialrelationship,'' Sween said in a decision filed in Hackensack andmade public by attorneys here.   The child's father, William Stern, and his wife, Elizabeth, havecustody of Melissa. They wanted Sween to delay for at least sixyears visits between Melissa and Mrs. Whitehead-Gould, who had beenseeing the child for two hours once a week under supervision.   Sween also moved to protect Melissa's privacy, barring bothsides from discussing her publicly, such as in the promotion ofbooks or movies, without court approval.   But Sween's ruling allows both sides to talk about theirexperiences, clearing the way for a book Mrs. Whitehead-Gould hasplanned.   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould said in a statement released by herattorneys that her relationship with Melissa ``will be strengthenedand advanced'' by the visitation and she looks forward to a``meaningful and substantial relationship.''   ``I hope that beginning today, there will be a renewed spirit ofcooperation between all of Melissa's parents; that this cooperationwill be fueled by our common interest in ensuring her happiness andwelfare,'' said Mrs. Whitehead-Gould.   The Sterns were generally unhappy with the ruling, but will notappeal, said one of their attorneys, Frank Donahue.   ``It wasn't their satisfaction with the decision that made themdecide against appealing. They wanted to put an end to thelitigation and the publicity and protect Melissa,'' Donahue said.   Sween rejected the Sterns contention during last week'svisitation hearing that Mrs. Whitehead-Gould would emotionally harmthe child and exploit her in the media.   ``Melissa is a resilient child who is no less capable thanthousands of children of broken marriages who successfully adjustto complex family realtionships when their parents remarry,'' Sweensaid.   The judge urged both sides to set aside the bad feelings, forMelissa's sake.   ``Family dreams have been shattered, insults and falseaccusations have been exchanged, and lies and deceptions made inthe heat of litigation,'' he said. ``However, family tragedies inour society are not uncommon and parents often are called upon tomake sacrifices.''   The emotional tug-of-war began after Mrs. Whitehead-Gould, thenmarried to Richard Whitehead, agreed to be artificially inseminatedwith Stern's sperm. Mrs. Whitehead, who is pregnant, has sincedivorced Whitehead and married accountant Dean Gould.   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould gave birth to the child March 31, 1986, butdecided to refuse the $10,000 surrogate fee and keep the baby. Thatdecision led to a landmark New Jersey Supreme Court ruling, whichoutlawed surrogacy-for-pay, restored Mrs. Whitehead-Gould'sparental rights, upheld custody for the Sterns and ordered thelower court hearing on visitation rights.   In a related development, a Florida Senate committee Wednesdayapproved a bill that would make it a felony to accept a fee to beara child for another couple.</TEXT></DOC>
