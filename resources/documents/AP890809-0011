But after a particularly tiringJune this year, five of the court's nine members sought renewaloverseas.   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist taught a course on SupremeCourt history in France for three weeks, and is lecturing in Sweden.   Justice Harry A. Blackmun has a similar gig in Austria, andJustices William J. Brennan and Anthony M. Kennedy have concludedteaching appearances in Scotland and England, respectively.   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor traveled in England.   Justice Antonin Scalia was to teach in China, but theopportunity fell victim to that country's political unrest.   Scalia this week is in Hawaii, along with Kennedy and JusticeByron R. White, for speaking engagements at the American BarAssociation.   Justices John Paul Stevens and Thurgood Marshall apparently haveno plans to travel outside the continental United States during thesummer recess.</TEXT><BYLINE>___</BYLINE><HEAD>Several Law Clerks Pass Up Lucrative Law Firm Jobs</HEAD><TEXT>   Meanwhile, back at the stately edifice on Capitol Hill, theannual ebb and flow of law clerks has seen those who served thejustices last term depart, replaced by those already preparing forthe coming term.

But there are someexceptions.   Two of Marshall's law clerks, Paul Engelmayer and JonathonSchwartz, have become assistant U.S. attorneys in New York City.Jane Stromseth, a law clerk for O'Connor, has joined the StateDepartment's legal office, and Cameron Findlay, who clerked forScalia, has become a special assistant to Secretary ofTransportation Samuel Skinner.

According to a recent Washington Post survey, the SupremeCourt's best known member is O'Connor _ 23 percent of those polledcould name her.   No other justice registered double-digit recognition: Kennedy, 7percent; Scalia, 5 percent; Marshall, 5 percent; Blackmun, 3percent; Brennan and White, 3 percent; and Stevens a lowly 1percent.   The survey-takers said only two of 1,005 people comprising thenational sample could name all nine members.</TEXT></DOC>
