Present work gives the mainenvironmental parameters (gamma rays exposition, temperature) and showsthe basis of the digital link designed to remote-handle such a manipulator.Up to 10/sup 5/ Gy behavior of optical fibers and electronic componentswas studied. Two different optical cables were built, one for the longlink (100 m), the second to set in an especially designed winding unwindingwheel. Six way permanent or remote-handle connectors were developed toconnect optical interfaces and a leaktight penetration. Measured budgetof the link taking into account efficient photoblesching of the puresilica core fiber and influence of gamma rays on the slave interfaceis presented.</TEXT></DOC>
