<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-57-0440 </DOCNO><TEXT>A survey for millisecond pulsars in a zone along the southern galacticplane has been carried out at a frequency of 843MHz using the MolongloObservatory Synthesis Telescope. The area covered by the survey was froml=255/sup 0/ to l-360/sup 0/, b=+-1/sup 0/ in about 7000 separate pointings.Sampling was at 0.5 ms intervals, giving nominal sensitivity down topulsar periods of one millisecond. For longer-period pulsars the limitingsensitivity was about 8 mJy for dispersion measures up to 400 cm/sup-3/ pc. The relatively high frequency of this survey ensured that anyreduction in sensitivity owing to interstellar dispersion and scatteringwas not serious up to distances corresponding to DM values of about 200cm/sup -3/ pc, allowing the search of a considerable volume for relativelybright millisecond pulsars. No millisecond pulsars were found, althoughsome suspects remain under investigation. One new pulsar with a period106 ms was discovered.</TEXT></DOC>
