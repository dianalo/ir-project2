The IDB had, in effect, fallen into the hands of its borrowers. The U.S. Treasury withdrew from negotiations on a $25 billion capital increase and dropped its request to Congress for the $9 billion U.S. contribution.    That got the IDB's attention, but we now wonder about the administration's strategy for winning a greater say in where and to whom the IDB lends money. Our concern arises from the candidate the U.S. seems prepared to support when the IDB's members select a new president tomorrow, Enrique Iglesias.    The IDB has lent more than $35 billion since its inception 27 years ago, much of it to create the type of parastatal companies Treasury Secretary James Baker has been trying to persuade Latin governments to dismantle. In short, the IDB has financed inefficient state monopolies at the expense of private, competitive development.    The December resignation of Antonio Ortiz Mena, president of the IDB these past 17 years, apparently was attributable in part to his conflicts with the Reagan administration over loan policies. It appeared that the U.S. had a clear choice between the two candidates for the top job. Colombian finance official Jaime Garcia Parra has a proven track record of success in his country's private sector, opening up the economy to outside investment and dismantling state enterprises. As a businessman, he turned Colombia's largest, private steel company into a profitable enterprise within four years. As minister of mines, he allowed Exxon to open up the Cerrejon coal mines. As minister of finance, he resisted the trend of Latin nations to borrow to the hilt.    His opponent, Uruguayan Foreign Minister Iglesias, has on the other hand spent much of his life pushing state interventionism and import substitution, at one point while head of the U.N.'s Economic Commission on Latin America. As foreign minister he recently supported a resolution to bring Cuba back into the Organization of American States.    Why hasn't the U.S. come out forcefully in favor of Mr. Garcia Parra? Part of the reason has to do with the changes the U.S. is seeking. It wants the IDB president to accept James Conrow, currently at Treasury, as the IDB's executive vice president. The U.S. hopes this will give veto power to the industrial nations that supply nearly all of the IDB's lending power. Currently, the U.S., Japan, Canada and Europe are outvoted by the borrowing nations. To get Mr. Conrow the U.S. feels it has to take Mr. Iglesias.    Mr. Iglesias will no doubt cooperate with the U.S. in the short term as he seeks to replenish the bank's four-year disbursement fund from $10 billion to about $20 billion. But after Mr. Iglesias gets the replenishment, it seems fairly likely that the borrowing nations will attempt to return to business as usual.    In striking a deal with Mr. Iglesias, the administration gives the outward appearance that it is willing to compromise with the statist policies so many Latin politicians have employed these past two decades. Latin voters themselves increasingly are rejecting such policies. If the administration makes a stand on principle and loses, it still has an ace in the hole, the same one it played last summer. There is no reason why it should be reluctant to use it. </TEXT></DOC>
