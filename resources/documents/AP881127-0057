(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A man who sued the heavy-metal rock group JudasPriest for allegedly prompting his 1985 suicide attempt has slippedinto a coma and is nearly brain dead, his mother said.   Phyllis Vance said doctors have told her that a preliminary testshows her son, James Vance, is 99.9 percent brain dead. Brain deathoccurs when all functions of the brain cease.   Mrs. Vance said doctors also told her they were unsure whatcaused her son to slip into a coma early Thursday, the day he wasscheduled to leave. Vance, 23, remained in serious condition Sundayat Washoe Medical Center.   Vance and his parents are suing the British band for ``subliminalmessages'' they contend caused Vance and Raymond Belknap, 19, tomake a suicide pact.   The two took a shotgun to a church playground in Sparks, Nev., in1985 and shot themselves in the head. Belknap died instantly.   The lawsuit, which was filed by the Vance and Belknap families,is pending in Washoe District Court. District Judge Jerry Whiteheadlast month gave CBS Records 30 days to turn over the master tape ofthe group's ``Stained Glass'' album so it can be examined forsubliminal messages.   CBS has said it cannot find the master tape for the 1978 album.The judge has said the case would not go to trial without evidenceof subliminal mesaages since music and lyrics are protected by theFirst Amendment.   If subliminal messages are found, the trial would focus onwhether such hidden communications deserve the same constitutionalprotection, the judge said.</TEXT></DOC>
