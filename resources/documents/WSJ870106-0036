Paulson, chairman of Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. since September 1985, sold his 34.2% stake in the steelmaker at a &quot;very substantial loss&quot; and said he will resign his post tomorrow.    The 64-year-old Mr. Paulson, who is also chairman and chief executive officer of Chrysler Corp.'s Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. unit, said his departure from Wheeling-Pittsburgh will allow him to pursue other interests. &quot;I have so many other things to do that I decided it was time to take my beating on the stock and get out,&quot; Mr. Paulson said in an interview from Savannah, Ga. &quot;I'm still running Gulfstream, and I have a lot of other things to do.&quot; He wouldn't elaborate.    Mr. Paulson sold his 1,747,796 common shares, which he had acquired for an estimated $50 million since the spring of 1983, to Lloyd C. Lubensky. Mr. Lubensky, also 64, is a Wheeling-Pittsburgh director and president of American Jet Industries Inc., a Van Nuys, Calif.-based maker of airplane engines.    Mr. Paulson wouldn't specify the selling price of his shares. But the transaction had an indicated value of about $13.5 million based on Wheeling-Pittsburgh's closing price Dec. 31, when the transaction was completed. On that day, the Pittsburgh-based company, which is in bankruptcy-law proceedings, closed at $7.75 a share in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.    Mr. Paulson said he plans to recommend that directors elect Mr. Lubensky, a close friend and business associate, to succeed him. Mr. Lubensky has been a Wheeling-Pittsburgh director since October 1985. George A. Ferris will continue as chief executive officer and vice chairman. A company spokesman said he didn't know whether Mr. Paulson also plans to resign as a director.    Mr. Lubensky, a former World War II bomber pilot, is the former owner of American Jet, which he recently sold to a unit of Ryder System Inc. Mr. Lubensky remains president of the company. Mr. Paulson founded American Jet about 28 years ago and in 1982 sold the concern to three principals, including Mr. Lubensky.    Mr. Paulson said he sold his stake primarily to take advantage of more favorable tax treatment in 1986 than under the new tax law, which went into effect Jan 1. &quot;I had offsetting gains that I could take against that (Wheeling stock) loss,&quot; he says.    Betting his hefty stake that the domestic steel industry was headed for a comeback, Mr. Paulson invested in Wheeling-Pittsburgh when others balked because he thought a major modernization program, including new equipment, would make the company a strong, long-term investment. Those prospects were dampened by the continued slump in the steel industry and by Wheeling-Pittburgh's Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law filing two years ago. Further damage was caused by a costly 98-day strike by United Steelworkers union members, also two years ago.    In a bold management shakeup aimed at solving the bitter union strike, Mr. Paulson engineered the resignation of Dennis J. Carney, formerly chairman and chief executive officer and other top officials of the nation's No. 7 steelmaker. As part of an agreement for the officials to resign, Mr. Paulson wrote three personal checks totaling $2.3 million for severance benefits for Mr. Carney and two of his aides. Mr. Ferris succeeded Mr. Carney.    Mr. Paulson, now citing the steelmaker's higher sales and improved cash flow, said yesterday that the company shows signs of surviving. However, he adds &quot;getting out of Chapter 11 is a long process.&quot; Under Chapter 11, a company is protected from creditor lawsuits while it devises plan to pay off its debt.    Mr. Paulson built his interest in aviation into Gulfstream Aerospace, a maker of corporate jets and other aviation products that he sold to Chrysler for $637 million in August, 1985. Mr. Paulson, who owned nearly 71% of Gulfstream, received about $450 million from the unit's sale.    Mr. Paulson, the son of a farmer from Clinton, Iowa, learned about planes in the Army during World War II, became an aircraft mechanic, then went to work for Trans World Airlines as a flight engineer. Later, as an aircraft parts dealer, he got into modifying and designing aircraft.    Some observers say that Mr. Paulson will likely set his sights on companies in businesses other than steel. &quot;I suspect that he has some motive,&quot; says Donald F. Barnett, a prominent steel consultant. &quot;He probably saw opportunities in other businesses.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
