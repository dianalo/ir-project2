Let Juries Decide   ----   By Stewart Abercrombie Baker</HL><DATE>09/27/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A18</SO><IN>MEDIA, PUBLISHING, BROADCASTING, ELECTRONIC PUBLISHING (MED)</IN><GV>JUSTICE DEPARTMENT (JUS)</GV><LP>   &quot;All journalism is an act of betrayal,&quot; according to JanetMalcolm, the New Yorker reporter whose betrayal of oneinterview subject may well provide the most fascinating FirstAmendment case in the Supreme Court's next term.   Actually, Janet Malcolm never quite said that, but thequotation is pretty close to things she has said. If youthink there's a big difference between quoting what Ms.Malcolm said and what she almost said, you've probablyalready chosen sides in a controversy that has dividedjournalists and judges alike as it makes its way through thecourts.</LP><TEXT>   On Monday the justices are expected to decide whether tohear the case, which arises from Janet Malcolm's New Yorkerprofile of the former projects director of the Sigmund FreudArchives, a voluble psychoanalyst named Jeffrey Masson.Despite long and apparently sympathetic interviews, Ms.Malcolm's article was highly unflattering -- full of Mr.Masson making colorfully indiscreet remarks. Mr. Masson sued.He claimed that the most colorful and indiscreet of hisremarks were really supplied by Ms. Malcolm herself -- thatshe had, for example, created from whole cloth a passage inwhich he bragged, &quot;I was like an intellectual gigolo&quot; to theaging Anna Freud.   Hoping to end the case without a trial, Ms. Malcolm askedthe courts to assume for the sake of argument that she didmake up the quotations. The First Amendment, she argued,protected her even if she changed Mr. Masson's words, becauseJeffrey Masson was the kind of self-dramatizing loudmouth whoprobably would have said these things if he'd had a chance.For example, to defend her &quot;intellectual gigolo&quot; quotation,Janet Malcolm pointed to a passage on the tapes in which Mr.Masson described himself as &quot;a private asset but a publicliability&quot; for Anna Freud.   Most of us would rather be called either a private assetor a public liability than a gigolo. But the Court ofAppeals, obviously concerned about the First Amendmentconsequences of letting the case go to a jury, said that Ms.Malcolm's quotation was close enough. As long as her versionwas a &quot;rational interpretation&quot; of what Mr. Masson actuallysaid, she was free to put her own words into his mouth.   The Court of Appeals got it wrong (at least the majoritydid -- Judge Alex Kozinski wrote a devastating dissent).Wrong not because the court relied on the First Amendment --the amendment is at the heart of the matter -- but because itacted as though the press were the only party with a FirstAmendment interest at stake.   When the Bill of Rights was drafted, practically every manwith the inclination could become a pamphleteer. Freedom ofthe press was just an offshoot of freedom of speech. Bothwere freedoms that allowed every individual to be heard.   Today's institutionalized press is a far cry from the lonepamphleteer. Fewer and fewer people have any prospect ofowning or writing for the mass media. Yet in the past 30years, as control of the press was becoming moreconcentrated, the protection the press received in the courtswas growing stronger.   Why? Because, despite its increasingly concentratedownership, today's press still is devoted in the main tocommunicating the views of many individuals. We don't readthe papers to find out what the publisher has to say aboutthe Middle East, but to find out what George Bush has to say,what Saddam Hussein has to say, what the wives of the 82ndAirborne and thousands of others have to say.   We value the press precisely because it brings us thespeech of these thousands of individuals. So when the pressgoes to court seeking special constitutional protection weknow that it is also defending the free-speech interests ofthousands who might never be heard without a free press. Itis the value of their speech that often tips the balance infavor of protecting the press.   But the press does not have those rights on its side everytime it goes to court. The Court of Appeals erred because itdidn't see that when a reporter or a publisher puts his ownwords into someone else's mouth, he ceases to be the ally ofall those thousands of individual speakers. He becomes theirenemy -- and his readers' as well. When we read a reporter'ssummary of someone else's remarks, no matter howdispassionate, we know we are getting the news through afilter, and we make allowances. That's why quotations are sopowerful. They tell us that we're getting the speaker's wordsdirect, without an intermediary.   Or at least that's what we thought before the Masson case.Now we can't be sure.   Under the lower court's rule, we may be getting only thereporter's &quot;rational interpretation&quot; of the speaker's words,an interpretation later dressed up in quotation marks to adddrama and disguise the reporter's hand.   Perhaps Janet Malcolm and reporters like her should befree to alter quotations and argue later that the words theyused were &quot;close enough&quot; -- that they captured the spirit ifnot the letter of the speaker's remarks. Sometimes that willbe true. And sometimes their changes will reflect somethingless admirable -- perhaps even a deliberate attempt tomislead.   Deciding whether the altered quotations are poetic licenseor deceit depends on a weighing of all the facts -- preciselythe kind of job that juries do every day in our judicialsystem.   There is no reason to take such questions away from thejury on First Amendment grounds. With First Amendmentinterests on both sides of the scale, the courts should treata reporter who has altered quotations no better and no worsethan any other tradesman accused of peddling fraudulentgoods.   ---   Mr. Baker, a Washington attorney, advised some of theparties filing briefs in the Masson case.</TEXT></DOC>
