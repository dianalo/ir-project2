Caroline, a widow at 33, donned black mourning clothes andrushed home from Paris, where she was visiting. Eight years andthree weeks earlier, her mother, Princess Grace, died after a carcrash.   Witnesses said Casiraghi, 30, and co-pilot Patrice Innocentidrove their catamaran, the Pinot di Pinot, straight into a wave atabout 93 mph during a morning heat of the World OffshoreChampionships being held near Monaco.   The 42-foot boat flipped over, ejecting Innocenti. Witnessessaid Casiraghi remained strapped to his seat and bore the fullimpact of the vessel slamming into the water. The two-engine,five-ton boat then sank, witnesses said.   Gianfranco Rossi, head of the race organizing committee, told anews conference Casiraghi was killed instantly. He said othercompetitors, as well as divers and a doctor, rushed to the strickenboat and found Casiraghi trapped in the cockpit, already dead.   Casiraghi was a sophisticated international financier when, at23, he married Caroline on Dec. 29, 1983.   At his death, he was chairman of Cogefar France, the Frenchsubsidiary of an Italian construction group owned by Fiat. He alsoheld a 52 percent interest in Engeco, which owns about 3,000apartments in Monaco and is building a $160 million apartmentcomplex.   And he was the father of three children - two sons and adaughter.   Casiraghi and Innocenti had been favored to win the three-stagerace, featuring sleek boats capable of speeds up to 125 mph.   The accident came 30 minutes after the second stage openedWednesday. Organizers canceled the day's events but said they wouldresume Thursday or Friday.   Casiraghi had a passion for offshore racing. A competitor since1984, he had won 12 of 80 races, including last year's worldchampionship held off Atlantic City, N.J.   Weather conditions off Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat, between Monaco andNice, were described as normal.   ``He surely didn't have time to look out and, at that speed,stuck under the boat, must have been killed by the blow,'' saidanother racer, Michel Karsten.   Emergency crews quickly pulled both men out of the water.Innocenti was rushed to Princess Grace Hospital and Casiraghireportedly was taken to the adjoining morgue.   The palace issued a two-sentence communique confirming the deathabout four hours after the accident.   The hospital said Innocenti, the boat's driver, was beingtreated for his injuries. It did not elaborate.   Caroline, the oldest child of Prince Rainier III and the formerHollywood star Grace Kelly, divorced French playboy Philippe Junotin 1980. She married Casiraghi on Dec. 29, 1983 in a civil ceremonyunder a portrait of her late mother.   They had three children - Andrea, 6; Charlotte, 4; and Pierre,3.   Their marriage brought some joy back to a family that wasdevastated by the death of Princess Grace in September 1982.   The automobile accident injured Caroline's younger sister,Princess Stephanie, and left Prince Rainier emotionallythunderstruck.   The relatively low-profile lifestyle Caroline had enjoyed sincemarrying Casiraghi contrasted vividly with the weekly splash shemade in the tabloids during the 1970s.   The couple were reported to have a close relationship anddivided their time between Monaco, the tiny minicipality ruled byCaroline's family since the 13th century, and Casiraghi's homeoutside Milan.   Their marriage followed Caroline's unhappy two-year union withJunot, who was 17 years her senior. He was photographed many timesduring their marriage in the company of other women.   A Roman Catholic, Caroline sought to have her first marriageannulled so she could wed Casiraghi in a religious ceremony andhave their children recognized by the church. She was never grantedthe annulment.   Casiraghi was born Sept. 8, 1960, the son of GiancarloCasiraghi, a self-made millionaire industrialist.   He attended private Catholic schools, including the GailloCollege in Como. He studied economics at the University of Bocconi- considered Italy's most prestigious business school - but nevergraduated.   Instead, he launched his first business, REDIM, a real estateconcern. That success was followed by export companies that soldsweaters and shoes in the United States.   Casiraghi also relished the pleasures of the jet set. Hevacationed in chic resorts like Saint-Moritz in the Alps andSaint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat on the Riviera, where his family owned homes.   He met Caroline at Jimmy's, a Monaco nightclub, and soon brokeoff his engagement to Pinuccia Macheda. He impressed the Grimaldifamily with his maturity and quickly won their approval.   Corriere Della Sera, one of Italy's leading dailies, once calledhim ``one of the true young lions of the jet set.''   Casiraghi had two older brothers, Marco and Danielle, and ayounger sister, Rosalba.</TEXT></DOC>
