It might not seem important,since many of us deal with the question only a few times in our lives. Butmultiply that by millions of families, and you've got a serious disposalproblem -- and the potential waste of a lot of resources.;    Used appliancesdon't have to wind up in a dump or on the side of the road, though. With asmall effort, we can ensure that old appliances are repaired and reused ifpossible, or that the materials are at least recycled.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  DON'T DUMP OLD FRIDGES AND STOVES  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  EarthWorks  </MEMO><TEXT>     There are three steps to recycling appliances:;      Check for hazards; (check) The coolant in refrigerators, freezers and air conditioners (likeFreon, for example) is made of ozone-depleting chemicals calledchlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). When appliances need to be scrapped, the CFCsshould be taken out and recycled -- if possible. A growing number of repairshops around the country offer CFC recycling.;    (check) Check for PCBs. Inthe mid-1970s, the Environmental Protection Agency found that some appliancemotors contained highly toxic polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), which cancontaminate soil and water when added to a landfill and pollute the air whenan appliance is scrapped. The EPA banned PCBs in 1979, but if your appliancewas made before 1980, it might contain them. Call the manufacturer to findout.;    (check) If it does have PCBs, the &quot;drive motor capacitor&quot; will haveto be removed and delivered to a hazardous-waste facility. Then the appliancecan go to a scrap yard. If you need more information, call a scrap-metaldealer for advice.;    (check) Air conditioners are the appliances most likelyto contain PCBs. Most water heaters, washers and dryers don't have them.;   (check) Note: Since stoves don't usually contain either motors orrefrigerants, they should be easy to recycle.;     Donate old appliances;   Non-profits like Goodwill Industries, St. Vincent de Paul Society and theSalvation Army generally will accept old appliances if they work. In manyparts of the country (where space is available), these non-profit groups holddaily &quot;as is&quot; auctions to sell items that need repair. This is one of the mosteffective ways to recycle appliances. The appliances are bought and repairedby flea marketers or smaller thrift-shop operators who then resell them to thepublic. Different organizations have different collection policies. Checkaround.;     Recycle for scrap;  (check) Consult your local recycling centeror scrap-metal dealers. Look in the Yellow Pages under &quot;Scrap Metal&quot; and&quot;Recycling.&quot;;    (check) Scrap-metal dealers should be able to tell you how toprepare your appliance so they can accept it.;    (check) If they don't pickup appliances, they may be able to connect you with individuals or companiesthat do.;    (check) Last resort: The retailer who sells you a new appliancemight be willing to haul the old one away (although it may cost you a fewbucks). Make sure it plans to recycle.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  John Javna  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910704  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  488  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday July 4, 199100186114,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
