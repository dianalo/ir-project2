In the fiscal 1986 third quarter, the agribusiness company earned $171,400, or four cents a share, on fewer shares outstanding.    Donald D. Dauer, president and chief operating officer, said revenue was &quot;about 30% higher&quot; than the year-earlier $10.2 million, indicating about $13.3 million for the latest quarter.    &quot;These are good numbers,&quot; he said in an interview, characterizing the company's latest results &quot;as strong as we expected.&quot; He noted that profit in the year-ago period was hurt significantly by foreign-currency losses related to a yen-denominated loan that has since been repaid. Another factor in the latest quarter was the dollar's drop, which is boosting overseas markets for the company's fresh fruit and citrus products.    Riverbend provides farm management, product handling and marketing services to absentee -- primarily institutional -- farm owners. The company went public in March, though members of the Harris family still own a controlling interest of more than 75%.    Mr. Dauer said Riverbend is expanding a program it started last year, under which the company has begun handling other fruits, such as peaches, grapes and apricots, whose countercyclical seasons keep its citrus packing plants busy during slack seasons. </TEXT></DOC>
