Connie Wickman, 78, of West Hills, Calif., told the HouseBanking Committee she and her 80-year-old husband were devastatedwhen they were told earlier this year their $25,000 in bonds soldthrough Lincoln Savings and Loan Association and issued by itsparent company, American Continental Corp. of Phoenix, Ariz., waslost.   ``When a senior citizen loses their life savings, it is not onlythe money they lose, but something more important,'' Mrs. Wickmansaid in a barely audible voice. ``They have failed _ themselves,their children, their families and also in tomorrow, believingthere is nothing left for them to believe in.''   The Wickmans are among 22,000 people, mostly Los Angeles-arearetirees, who state and federal officials say were targeted byLincoln to switch nearly $200 million of federally insured depositsinto junk bonds after federal examiners first recommended closingthe Sandamp;L in May 1987.   Those bonds became virtually worthless when American Continentaldeclared bankruptcy last April, one day before the governmentfinally seized its Irvine, Calif., Lincoln subsidiary which hadlost an estimated $2 billion in savers' federally insured deposits.   The government last month filed a $1.1 billion suit againstLincoln's owner, Phoenix millionaire Charles H. Keating Jr.charging fraud and racketeering.   Meanwhile, both the FBI and the Senate Ethics Committee areinvestigating whether five senators who received $1.3 million inpolitical contributions from Keating intervened with federalregulators in keeping Lincoln open for two years after governmentexaminers recommended closing it down.   The five senators _ Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.; John McCain,R-Ariz.; Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; Donald Riegle Jr., D-Mich.; andJohn Glenn, D-Ohio _ all have denied any wrongdoing.   But Mrs. Wickman's daughter, Frances Rose of West Hills, heldKeating and Cranston responsible for what she described as a fraudthat could make her parents destitute in the near future.   Over the past three years, Keating has contributed a total of$974,000 in either campaign funds to Cranston or to voterregistration and other political causes headed by members ofCranston's family. Among the items being investigated by the FBI iswhether any of that money was illegally diverted from Lincolndepositors' accounts.   ``They found it so painfully hard to believe that SenatorCranston, a man whom they had supported and voted for during manyyears, had received part of his hard-earned dollars carefully savedeach weeks for 30 years,'' Mrs. Rose said of her parents.   ``The `gentlemen' _ Mr. Cranston, Mr. Keating and others fromAmerican Continental _ have not even had the decency to show asimple courtesy and answer one of the many letters we have writtento them in the past year,'' she said.   The House committee, which has been holding hearings intoLincoln for a month, heard from three other investors whose savingswere lost as it turned its investigation to the roles of theSecurities and Exchange Commission and private accounting firms inthe alleged fraud.   ``What truly hurts in this situation is that 90 percent of thedebentures were peddled to the public ... long after the alarmbells had gone off at the Federal Home Loan Bank Board,'' saidCommittee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas.   Meanwhile, the nation's top thrift regulator who, as the bankboard's chairman since 1987, has been the target of the panel'sprobe says he has no intention of resigning amid indications he maybe lossing support from the Bush administration.   ``I've had no indication either way from the president,'' M.Danny Wall, told reporters Monday in response to President Bush'sremark that he has not ruled out replacing Wall as director of theTreasury Department's Office of Thrift Supervision.   Bush, in an interview with Texas reporters last Friday, said heintended to respond ``fairly soon'' to a request last month by theHouse committee's chairman, Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, toreplace Wall.   ``I'm not closing the door on it; I just don't know at thisjuncture,'' Bush said. ``But when the question is put: `If part ofthe savings and loan problem proves to be management or regulationpeople that aren't aggressive enough, would you make changes?,' theanswer is yes.''   Wall, a former banking aide to Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah, saidMonday that he interprets those remarks as an indication thepresident wants to hear both sides before making any judgment.   ``The president ... knows that one is innocent until provenguilty,'' Wall said, reiterating complaints that Gonzalez hasrepeatedly postponed his appearance before the panel. ``Certainlyone has to have an opportunity to respond to the questions that areraised.''</TEXT></DOC>
