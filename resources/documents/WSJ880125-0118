Sherman asks the 78-year-old woman seated across the desk from him. &quot;Say 'no ifs, ands or buts.' What's this called?&quot; -- pointing to his watch.    The answers are hesitant -- and wrong. Then come more questions, a physical examination, a lengthy talk with the woman's 81-year-old husband about her multiple problems, including depression and high blood pressure.    &quot;Here's what we're going to do,&quot; Dr. Sherman tells the husband, speaking slowly and clearly. &quot;I'm stopping the medicine she's been getting. That may help her depression. But it could also make her more agitated. She may even try to hit you, and so I'll give you another prescription to use if she becomes that upset. I think we can get her back eating, make her a little less depressed and keep the blood pressure under control. But I don't think we're going to be able to do very much about her memory.&quot;    The 42-year-old Dr. Sherman, a youthful-looking man long plagued by his resemblance to comedian Jerry Lewis, is one of a rare but increasingly needed type of practitioner: a geriatrician, a doctor specially trained to diagnose and treat the old, particularly the very old and frail. The rapidly aging U.S. population, experts agree, urgently requires both far more geriatricians and far greater knowledge of geriatrics among other doctors.    &quot;All practitioners except pediatricians are going to be spending a large part of their time with the problems of older people,&quot; says T. Franklin Williams, the director of the National Institute on Aging.    Census Bureau figures underline the need. The number of Americans 65 and over is projected to swell from 29 million today to more than 65 million by 2050. Moreover, the fastest growth is coming among the very old -- those in their late 70s, 80s and beyond, when the diseases and disorders of aging levy the heaviest toll.    And old people, especially the very old, are heavy users of medical services. According to the government, the 12% of the population 65 and over accounts for more than a fifth of physicians' time and almost a third of acute hospital admissions.    The number of full-time geriatricians isn't precisely known because, in the absence of any special certification, any doctor can claim to be a geriatric specialist. But studies estimate that of 450,000 doctors caring for patients, fewer than 2,000 call geriatrics their primary specialty. Most are in large medical centers.    Dr. Sherman is one of the few community-based geriatricians practicing almost exclusively as primary care givers. &quot;Today, community-based geriatrics is in the corner of the closet under a mouse,&quot; he complains. &quot;But this is where the action is, where there is the need.&quot;    The average age of his more than 500 patients is 75. Most live at home or with relatives, though a handful are in nursing homes or the local hospital. The vast majority are widows or single women.    About half suffer a mental disorder, usually Alzheimer's. &quot;You get a message to call,&quot; he says sadly, &quot;and when you call back, they don't remember what the problem was.&quot; A wry sense of humor helps him keep his balance. When an elderly patient walking in stockinged feet keeps slipping on the hospital floor, Dr. Sherman suggests he try wearing shoes. &quot;High-tech medicine,&quot; he comments to an observer.    Though some doctors dismiss geriatrics as just family medicine with a twist, the medical problems are, in fact, quite different from those of younger people. Chronic illnesses -- mental problems, diabetes, heart trouble, hypertension and other ailments that can at best be only stabilized or slowed -- replace the acute, often-curable illnesses. Moreover, most sick old people suffer from many diseases at once. Medications for multiple ailments often work at cross-purposes, and treatment is harder.    &quot;Treating a 27-year-old flight attendant who has a urinary infection, you don't have to worry about heart disease, depression, other problems. But with an 80-year-old, these are all major concerns,&quot; says John Rowe, who heads the Division on Aging at Harvard Medical School.    Loss of hearing and other functional disabilities exacerbate problems. The mind's slippage makes it more difficult and time-consuming for a doctor to learn a patient's history and symptoms. Many diseases present themselves differently in the aged; a heart attack may strike a 75-year-old without the chest pains that warn a 40-year-old. The elderly recover from illnesses more slowly.    Consider another Sherman patient, an 82-year-old woman. Two years earlier, after a hip fracture, her then-doctor discontinued the medicine combating her failing thyroid. Eventually, she had to be hospitalized, her thyroid rate down further, her heart rate and temperature falling, her legs swollen, her mind slipping.    Called into the case by a daughter unhappy over that deterioration, Dr. Sherman has been treating the woman with thyroid hormones. Her thyroid and heart rates are coming back up. She's getting physical therapy to begin walking again.    &quot;She may be in the early stages of Alzheimer's,&quot; he says, &quot;but I won't make that diagnosis until we get her thyroid back to normal. There's really a great potential for improvement.&quot;    New patients invariably show up with bags containing a dozen or more medications prescribed by various doctors for various ailments. But blood-pressure medicine may make an old person dehydrated and dizzy; a drug for incontinence may cause mental confusion or heart problems. Much of Dr. Sherman's job is trial-and-error experimentation with different drugs -- discontinuing one, slightly increasing dosage of another, cutting back a third. &quot;It's like walking a tightrope,&quot; he says.    Psychological, economic and social problems must be handled. Retirement and empty time, low income, death of a spouse or fear of one's own death can bring depression. A move from a house to an apartment can be disorienting.    &quot;Old age is a season of losses,&quot; Dr. Sherman says. &quot;If the husband has died within the past six months to a year, I'm looking for depression. I may see the person more frequently during that period, or I may ask the daughter to watch Mother more closely for a while.&quot;    Often, the geriatrician has to care for the caretaker, too; the aged spouse or middle-aged child must remain healthy enough to help the patient without resort to a nursing home or hospital. Frail old couples, says Dennis Jahnigen, the head of geriatrics at the Cleveland Clinic, are &quot;toothpick structures: pull out one toothpick, and the whole structure collapses.&quot;    A demented patient's husband tells Dr. Sherman, &quot;I'm beginning to feel overwhelmed. I feel, my God, what happens to her if I get sick?&quot; Says Dr. Sherman: &quot;That's why you have to organize some help, family help or outside help you may have to pay for.&quot; He urges the man to see a doctor: &quot;You're under a lot of stress.&quot;    But help may be hard to find and, unless welfare assistance is available, expensive. &quot;I discuss money with every single patient or with the family,&quot; Dr. Sherman says. &quot;If they don't bring it up, I do.&quot;    Geriatricians dispute the widespread notion that old people are hypochondriacs constantly running to the doctor with imaginary ailments. Actually, studies show, the old tend to underreport their health troubles, all too often dismissing them as &quot;just part of aging.&quot;    The cardinal principle of geriatrics is that the old aren't sick because they're old but because they're sick -- with specific, often-treatable disorders. &quot;Health problems may be due to specific diseases or to lifestyle causes -- smoking, nutrition, lack of exercise,&quot; NIA's Dr. Williams says. &quot;The more we study, the more we find comparatively little due to aging per se.&quot;    It is this, geriatricians say, that many doctors inexperienced in treating the aged don't realize. So, they may make mistakes. Although most other mental impairments in old people are progressive and irreversible, for instance, perhaps 10% to 30% of such cases are caused by something else. &quot;Depression and drug intoxication are the two things that most look like dementia,&quot; says Edward Schneider, the dean of the Andrus Gerontology Center at the University of Southern California. &quot;And these can be treated.&quot;    But because so many health problems of the aged are chronic, geriatricians say their successes must be measured differently from those of doctors handling acute illnesses with antibiotics or surgery.    &quot;Getting an aged person out of bed and walking with a walker can be just as important as a total cure in a younger person,&quot; says Leslie Libow, professor of geriatrics at New York's Mount Sinai Hospital. One of Dr. Sherman's medical tools is an ordinary wood saw: &quot;A frequent source of falls is a cane that's too long,&quot; he explains. &quot;Instead of helping to bear the weight, it makes walking more difficult. So, I take off a few inches.&quot;    Although geriatricians work mostly with the frail and sick, they also can help the healthy old. &quot;There are issues and problems we can begin to prevent -- risks for coronary, stroke, cancer,&quot; Dr. Sherman says. &quot;We can talk about exercising more, not smoking.&quot;    Most of Dr. Sherman's days start with visits to the dozen or so acute-care patients he may have in the 400-bed Huntington Hospital. Then, he may see 20 to 25 people at his office -- interviewing patients and relatives, rushing back and forth between his two examining rooms, talking on the phone with patients, family members or colleagues, rarely eating lunch.    &quot;You have to keep moving,&quot; he frequently tells elderly patients. He himself maintains a breakneck pace. &quot;This is my way to stay healthy,&quot; he says.    ---          Selected Chronic Conditions of Old Age         (Per 1,000 persons by sex and age, 1986)                                            65 and Older    Type of Chronic Condition            Male         Female    Arthritis                            358.6         565.8    Cataracts, Glaucoma and other     visual impairment                   242.0         301.0    Hearing impairment                   371.0         242.7    Deformity or orthopedic     impairment                          137.4         197.5    Heart Disease                        295.5         263.3    Hypertension                         329.5         440.0    Cerebrovascular disease               66.0          65.7    Diabetes                              99.2          97.6   Source: National Center for Health Statistics</TEXT></DOC>
