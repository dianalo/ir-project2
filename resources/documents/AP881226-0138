The current cure rate for cancer would rise to 55 percent to 60percent from its current level of 50 percent.   One-third of all beds in cancer centers would no longer beoccupied by victims of smoking.   Fewer of our young people would take up drugs since smokingteen-agers are 15 times more likely to graduate to narcotics.   The air would be cleaner everywhere _ on planes, in hotels,sports arenas, restaurants, public buildings, places of employment,the movies and homes. Some 46,000 deaths to non-smokers would cease.   And our nation would no longer be paying out $65 billion annuallyfor medical bills and lost productivity incurred by cigarettesmoking.   The life expectancy gain for people who would have experienced atobacco-related death would be approximately 15 years.   Families would no longer have to endure the loss of loved ones tocigarettes and children would no longer have to worry about the fateof their smoking parents.   Public health and agricultural officials would no longer confrontus with the paradox of, on the one hand, ordering warning statementson cigarette packs and the other, providing subsidies for the growthof a lethal product.   Funds now invested in research and treatment for smoking-inducedillnesses could be diverted to new areas of promise in medicine andscience.   The pack of lies, the lady killers, the coffin nails would berelics of our past. The environment would become safer, healthierand better for all.   One would hope that the Marlboro Cowboy could be rehabilitated tochampion enlightened causes _ like ``say no to drugs,'' ``stop drunkdriving'' _ or perhaps encourage people to have annual checkups forcancer.</TEXT><TEXT/><HEAD>From the Pro-smoking Camp:</HEAD><TEXT/><BYLINE>By GUY L. SMITH</BYLINE><HEAD>Vice President, Corporate Affairs, Philip Morris U.S.A.</HEAD><HEAD>For The Associated Press</HEAD><TEXT>   Paradise. That's what the anti-tobacco zealots would call a worldwithout tobacco. We'd say more a fool's paradise.   If those opposed to tobacco were to succeed in dictating whichbehaviors were acceptable and which were not, life would become veryunpleasant for smokers and non-smokers alike.   The sad fact is that once the antis eliminated free choiceregardinq tobacco, they would affect free choice itself. The adultenjoyment of alcoholic beverages could be next on their hit list.From there, where? What would the self-appointed moralists, withtheir predictable self-serving claims, ban next: red meat, eggs,dairy products, artificial sweeteners, coffee? Would any product orbehavior still be an object of free choice?   Before we yield to such action, it might be wise to reflect onwhat this country is all about. The United States was founded byinspired curmudgeons who were wise enough to realize that inprotecting others' rights to disagree with them, they wereprotecting their own right to disagree with others.   The Constitution reflects this wisdom. The founders saw the follyin having one person or group dictate the choices of another personor group. It also protects the rights of non-smokers.   From the beginning, tobacco was part of American history. Itserved as collateral for loans from France to finance theRevolution, and its value helped sustain the young nation. All thewhile it was freely criticized. In 1604, King James called it a``loathsome custom.'' The colonists and revolutionaries werechastised by moralists, but continued to grow and enjoy tobacco aspart of their free choice.   Who are today's smokers, the people whose choice would be usurpedin a world without tobacco? Everybody. There are nearly 60 millionadults who choose to smoke, part of the fabric of American society.They raise families, pay billions of dollars in tobacco taxes andhave the same hopes and dreams as anyone else.   When ``a world without tobacco'' is promised as paradise, do notforget that the price is loss of free choice, and that is paradiselost.</TEXT><NOTE>END ADV</NOTE></DOC>
