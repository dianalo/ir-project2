The department's determination, announced Tuesday, now goes tothe International Trade Commission, which has 45 days to decidewhether the imports injure the U.S. pork industry.   If the commission agrees with the Commerce finding, thedepartment will order the Bureau of Customs to collectcountervailing duties on the imports to offset the subsidies.   Canadian pork imports that would be subject to such duties wereabout $341 million last year.   The department's investigation was triggered by a Januarycomplaint from the National Pork Producers Council, the NationalPork Council Women, ConAgra Red Meats Inc., Dakota Pork IndustriesInc., Farmstead Foods, IBP Inc., Illinois Pork Corp., Thorn AppleValley and Wilson Foods Inc.   The department said its investigation did not include processedor preserved pork products such as canned hams, cured bacon,sausage, ground pork or live swine. It noted it had found imports oflive swine to be subsidized in a 1985 investigation.   The Canadian Embassy said it would use the dispute resolutionprocedures of the new U.S.-Canadian free trade agreement to pressits view that the department is wrong.   The Embassy said U.S. law is wrong under international traderules to count as a subsidy income-stabilization arrangementsdesigned to smooth out fluctuations in farmers' incomes. Also, U.S.law should not automatically assume that any benefits from suchplans are fully passed through to the pork processor, the Embassysaid.</TEXT></DOC>
