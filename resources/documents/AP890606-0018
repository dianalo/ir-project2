Forty-three of the 50 weapons and six of the nine reactors areSoviet, and the real number may be much higher because so fewdetails are known of secretive Soviet navy operations, said WilliamArkin, an analyst who worked with Greenpeace on the project.   ``We got no information at all from the Soviets,'' said Arkin,who works at the Institute for Policy Studies, a liberal Washingtoninterest group. ``We were totally unsuccessful in getting any kindof real response from them. And we were totally unsuccessful ingetting any information from U.S. intelligence about Soviet navalaccidents.''   Using material obtained from the U.S. government under theFreedom of Information Act, the researchers listed 1,276 accidentssince World War II involving military vessels.   The accidents caused more than 2,800 deaths and ranged inseverity from the loss of an entire vessel and crew to minorcollisions and fires that caused little damage and few if anyinjuries.   Greenpeace said that of the accidents, 228 involved aircraftcarriers, 406 other major surface warships, 182 supply ships, 142minor military ships and 75 amphibious vessels. Separately, 75incidents involved sinkings.   Twenty-seven submarines have sunk in that period, including fiveSoviet, four American, four French and three British, as well assubmarines from West Germany, Israel, Pakistan, Peru, Spain andTurkey, the analysts reported in their 101-page study.   Perhaps the most serious accident was the sinking of a SovietYankee-class submarine on Oct. 6, 1986, with 32 nuclear warheadsand two nuclear torpedoes aboard 600 miles northeast of Bermuda.   More recently, a Soviet `Mike' class submarine sank off thecoast of Norway in April with two nuclear reactors and two nucleartipped torpedoes aboard, the report said.   ``Between 1975-1985, according to the U.S. Navy, the SovietUnion had over 200 serious submarine accidents,'' according to asummary of the report. ``The Soviet Union has had more sinkings,more propulsion failures, and according to U.S. intelligencesources, more accidents than the United States.''   Greenpeace earlier revealed information about two U.S. accidentsthat received wide publicity over the past month. In 1965, an A-4warplane fell off the USS Ticonderoga off Okinawa with a hydrogenbomb aboard, and on Nov. 22, 1975, a fire aboard the USS Belknapcame within 40 feet of nuclear weapons.   Although the report carried the greatest detail about incidentsinvolving U.S. vessels, its sharpest criticism was of the Soviets.Arkin said he planned to deliver a Russian-language version of thestudy to the Soviet Embassy in Washington and would seek a meetingwith Soviet officials.   ``Official secrecy, particularly that of the Soviet Union, aswell as sporadic news media interest in reporting routineaccidents, are major impediments to compiling a complete record,''the report said.   ``Of the 1,276 accidents, 799 have involved naval ships of theUnited States,'' it said. ``This preponderance of U.S. accidentsdoes not mean a higher accident rate than other navies,particularly the Soviet Navy.   ``Many hundreds more Soviet accidents are known to haveoccurred, but due to inadequate data and excessive secrecy, we havebeen unable to document specific dates or circumstances,'' it said.   Asked in a telephone interview to give an example of a Sovietnaval accident in which nuclear weapons or reactors were suspectedbut not documented to be involved, Arkin cited the sinking of adestroyer in the Black Sea in 1974.   ``A Kashin-class destroyer with 275 crewmen sank with all hands.Our speculation is that there were probably nuclear torpedoesaboard,'' said Arkin.</TEXT></DOC>
