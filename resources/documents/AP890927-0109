(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The state Supreme Court has agreed tohear the appeal of a woman ordered to get married or move out ofher house, or lose custody of her child.   The high court's unanimous agreement Tuesday to hear thepetition of Judith Annette Roush halts enforcement of orders issuedAug. 23 by Kanawha County Judge John Hey. Arguments are scheduledNov. 7 before the Supreme Court.   The case arose from a post-divorce claim for a change of custodyof Mrs. Roush's 14-year-old daughter.   The appeal said Hey rejected the recommendation of a courtofficial known as a family law master that the child stay with hermother solely because Mrs. Roush and her daughter live with a manto whom Mrs. Roush is not married.   ``The court therefore grants plaintiff 30 days from the date ofthis hearing in which either to marry such man or move out andestablish separate living arrangements for her and her daughter,''Hey said.   Hey said if Roush does not comply, he will grant custody ofMelissa Ann Roush to her father, Rodney Roush. Hey also voidedRoush's child support obligation for the 30 days and until Mrs.Roush meets one of the judge's stipulations, the appeal said.   The couple divorced in January 1988 and Mrs. Roush was givencustody of the daughter. That September, Melissa moved in with herfather, who petitioned to modify the divorce decree.   Mrs. Roush moved in with Robert Cain and his 13-year-olddaughter in St. Albans in January, and Melissa Roush followed inApril, the petition said.   The lawsuit said Mrs. Roush believed the two girls living in thesame house would provide a stable environment for Melissa.   Melissa wants to live with her mother, said the petition, whichadded that Mrs. Roush takes home $80-$100 a week and cannot affordto maintain an apartment of her own.</TEXT></DOC>
