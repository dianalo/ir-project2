Drexel, which claims it is innocent of any wrongdoing, repeatedthat assertion Tuesday in disclosing receipt of a so-called``target letter'' from the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office.   The disclosure came a month after Drexel, one of the biggestWall Street firms, was accused by the Securities and ExchangeCommission of extensive securities fraud in an alleged conspiracyinvolving four key employees and now-imprisoned insider trader IvanF. Boesky.   Although it has been widely known for months that a grand juryhas been probing Drexel's activities, formal notification often isseen as a strong signal that prosecutors believe they have enoughevidence to bring charges.   Bruce Baird, the assistant U.S. attorney in charge of securitiesfraud cases, was out of the office and unavailable for comment, anaide said. Office spokeswoman Deborah Corley said she could notcomment.   ``The U.S. attorney has advised Drexel Burnham by letter that itis a target of a grand jury investigation looking into allegedviolations of the federal criminal laws,'' the firm said in astatement.   ``According to the staff of the U.S. attorney, no determinationhas been made by the U.S. attorney to seek an indictment. DrexelBurnham believes that any such indictment would be unwarranted andunfair.''   Drexel, a pioneer in the ``junk bond'' high-yield debt market,has been under intense scrutiny by both the U.S. attorney's officeand the SEC because of disclosures by Boesky, who once hadextensive dealings with the firm and who settled insider tradingcharges two years ago by paying a $100 million fine.   In exchange for his cooperation in implicating others, Boeskywas allowed to plead guilty to a single criminal charge, conspiracyto lie to the SEC.   On Sept. 7 the SEC filed a long-awaited civil complaint allegingDrexel, its high-yield bond financier Michael Milken and othersschemed with Boesky to profit on inside information, cheat Drexelclients, hide stock in each other's names to avoid reportingrequirements and commit other frauds.   Drexel, Milken and the other defendants denied thoseaccusations. If a grand jury were to indict them, the SEC suitlikely would be delayed by the more serious criminal charges.   The SEC suit already has been delayed by pretrial haggling overevidence gathering and the impartiality of the federal judgepresiding over the case, Milton Pollack.   On Monday, Pollack rejected defense attorney requests that hedisqualify himself, calling their arguments unfounded. The defensehas vowed to appeal his ruling.</TEXT></DOC>
