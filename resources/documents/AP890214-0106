Western diplomats, guerrilla leaders and others generally feelthe government in Kabul has a few months at most after Wednesday,the deadline for Soviet withdrawal.   Divisions within guerrilla ranks, however, could prolong a civilwar that already has ravaged the country for nearly 11 years. Someinsurgent commanders also say government forces may put up moreresistance than expected.   President Najib insists his government won't be defeated and cansurvive even though a Soviet force estimated at 115,000 soldiersfailed for nine years to overcome the guerrillas.   Soviet military forces entered Afghanistan in December 1979 tohelp fight an insurgency that began after a communist coup in April1978. The Red Army withdrew under an agreement mediated by theUnited Nations.   The seven main guerrilla groups, members of an alliance based inPakistan, are deeply divided and their leaders are locked in astruggle for power. Guerrillas in the field have little discipline,possess few heavy weapons and lack the kind of military experienceneeded to assault and capture cities.   Guerrilla leaders say they do not want to assault Kabul and othercities because of the inevitable civilian casualties.   Abdul Haq, a top commander, said up to 300,000 civilians could bekilled in an assault on Kabul, whose normal population has doubledto about 2 million because of refugees.   ``We're fighting to free this country,'' Haq said. ``We're notfighting to kill our own people.''   Some guerrilla leaders say arrangements have been made for thecities to be surrendered with no resistance from the government, butranking field commanders say they are unaware of such plans.   A system must be devised for soldiers to surrender with safety,Haq said, because those who fear for their lives could be provokedinto fighting.   ``They cannot resist for a long time, but if we make them fightfor survival they will fight,'' he said.   Najib's army has about 30,000 men, most of them poorly trainedconscripts who do not support the government, according to Westernintelligence estimates. Army units usually perform poorly againstthe insurgents.   Also at the government's disposal, however, are more reliablemilitary units and other groups of loyalists who probably facereprisals if the guerrillas win.   Some insurgent commanders estimate the regime has up to 50,000loyalists ready to fight, including secret service units, the army'selite guard, paramilitary police and party members. Governmentmilitia units composed of former guerrillas also would have littlechoice but to fight, they said.   ``These people would have no place in Afghanistan and there aremany among the people who want justice for what the communists havedone,'' said Masoud Khalili, a senior guerrilla official.   Weapons and ammunition appear to be no problem for governmentforces. The Soviets are leaving huge stockpiles behind.   Tough or desperate government units in the cities could mountsustained resistance in fortified positions capable of withstandingguerrilla hit-and-run tactics.   By contrast, some Western diplomats say an internal coup or powerstruggle between rival Communist Party factions could topple Najib,or senior army commanders might make a deal with the insurgents.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Barry Renfrew has covered the war in Afghanistansince 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
