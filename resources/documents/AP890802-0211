The 2{-year federal investigation at the Chicago Board of Tradeand the Chicago Mercantile Exchange resulted in allegations thattraders systematically conspired with one another to skim profitsfrom customers' accounts, and often tried to hide the profits fromthe Internal Revenue Service.   Sixteen of the traders were charged with violating the federalRacketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations act, which empowersthe government to freeze defendants' assets before a trial forseizure upon conviction.   The government increasingly has been using the law _ enacted tofight organized crime such as drug trafficking _ to crack down onsecurities crime and other white-collar corruption.   U.S. Attorney General Richard Thornburgh, who attended the newsconference at which the indictments were announced, said thecharges were part of a ``crackdown on white-collar crime in all itsvarious guises, from Wall Street to LaSalle Street to Main Streetand all stops in between.''   LaSalle Street is the heart of Chicago's financial district.   ``The activity uncovered at these exchanges _ the largest oftheir type in the world _ cannot be tolerated,'' Thornburgh said.   U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas said traders broke the law and therules governing business at the exchange by arranging deals withone another before and after the pits were open for trading.   He said the alleged activity involved hundreds of customers andthousands of trades. No dollar amount was given for the allegedfraud but Valukas said it was ``significant.''   Officials said the investigation was continuing and indicatedmore indictments were possible.   The charges, contained in four indictments totaling 375 pages,included hundreds of counts against the 46 people named.   Nineteen indictments were returned for activities in the soybeanpits and three in the U.S. Treasury bond pits at the Board ofTrade. At the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, 21 indictments were inthe Japanese yen pits and three each in Swiss franc pits.   The government said directors of the Board of Trade and theMercantile Exchange were not involved in the illegal activity andhad cooperated in the investigation.   ``The legitimate activities of these exchanges, involvingeverything from grains to government bonds and foreign currencies,impact upon farmers, consumers, businesses and governments,'' saidThornburgh, who was joined by Valukas, FBI director WilliamSessions and Wendy Gramm, head of the Commodity Futures TradingCommission at the news conference.   ``I want to assure all parties that public confidence in thehonest functioning of the marketplace will be vigorouslyprotected,'' Thornburgh added.   Sessions said the FBI used ``extraordinary means to detectextraordinary fraud,'' training agents in the complicated world offutures trading and sending them onto the exchange floors to minglewith real traders.   Valukas said the illegal schemes involved pre-arranged trades atprices below what the traders' customers actually paid for acommodity. The traders involved would then share the illegalprofit, he said.   At the close of business, traders frequently agreed amongthemselves to change prices on their cards to increase theirprofits and correct bad deals, the prosecutor said.   Valukas cited specific instances during the summer of 1988 _when soybean prices were rising rapidly because of the drought _where brokers routinely withheld orders from the market and thengave them to favored traders, cheating the customer out of a fairmarket price.   ``What we are talking about here are hundreds of customersinvolving thousands of trades for which fraud was perpetrated andlosses incurred by those customers because of this scheme,''Valukas said.   The FBI investigation, disclosed in January, also centered onallegations that brokers sent false reports to customers to hidethe skimming of profits or overcharges on commissions.   The Mercantile Exchange also reportedly is planning to bring itsown charges against four traders in connection with yen-pit tradeswith one of the undercover FBI agent who posed as traders in thefederal investigation.   Traders have been bargaining with authorities and the exchangesto reduce the possible penalties against them.   Futures are contracts to buy or sell, by a future date at aspecified price, commodities and financial instruments ranging fromsoybeans and pork bellies to Treasury bonds and baskets of stocks.   Futures traders can make and lose fortunes within minutes whilestanding shoulder-to-shoulder in the pits and trading with eachother.   Independent traders, called ``locals,'' trade for their ownaccounts. Other traders, called brokers, trade on behalf of clientsof futures brokerages. Some brokers also trade for their ownaccounts in an often-criticized practice called dual trading.   The government won a key battle clearing the way for theindictments on Friday when Chief U.S. District Judge John Gradydenied a Swiss franc trader's contention that the government'ssecret taping of traders on the exchange floors had violatedfederal electronic surveillance laws.</TEXT></DOC>
