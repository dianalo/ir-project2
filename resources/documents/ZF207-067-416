(EDS) for non-storefront dealer status.andM;Many dealers viewed the EDS agreement as new competition, but Aschauerdiscounts that fear.andM;''The concern among dealers is that it will dilute their market potential.andO;This absolutely does not do that,'' said Aschauer.andP;  ''This is a move on ourpart to get at incremental market opportunities through a different kind ofdistribution.andM;''The customer that EDS is serving, or the customer that any systemsintegrator is serving .andP;  .  .  is not available to the average dealer,''Aschauer said.andP;  This is because the services a customer receives from asystems integrator -- such as PC-to-mainframe integration, training andnationwide delivery -- are not generally available from dealers, he said.andM;Aschauer noted that the non-storefront program is in its infancy.andP;  Applehopes to strike more reseller agreements with both large systems integratorslike EDS, and with smaller, vertically integrated VARs, he said.andM;All new agreements will count toward Apple's total dealer limit of 2,000nationally, he said.andP;  Apple declined to release its total number of currentdealers and a breakdown of storefront and non-storefront authorizations.andP;  Aspokesperson, however, said the number was well below the 2,000 limit.andM;Apple's move toward more non-storefront arrangements is a direct result ofthe introduction of the Macintosh II and its penetration into largecorporations and non-traditional Apple markets like computer-aided design,according to Aschauer.andM;''We have to focus distribution at different levels,'' he said.andP;  ''Ifeveryone is focused on the same target, then there isn't any profit in it,and we miss all the other targets.andM;''It was very easy five years ago when the only one who bought an Apple PCwas a consumer or small businessman,'' he continued.andP;  ''Then we could use onemethod to get at the whole market.andM;''But now, as we move forward with the level of applications and further upthe corporate organization, we need to develop a channel of distribution thatmeets the level of need.andP;  So what we end up with is a grid that isspecialized along different market needs,'' he said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
