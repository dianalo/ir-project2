Kenneth Heebner bet big on the Rust Belt last year, he made heady gains. This year, the gamble has led to a hangover.    Mr. Heebner, who manages about $1 billion in assets for Loomis-Sayles andamp; Co., stocked up on metal issues, particularly copper and aluminum shares, in the spring of 1987. The result: His five funds far outstripped the year's 4.9% gain in the Standard andamp; Poor's-500 stock index -- including a whopping 53% gain for his New England Zenith Capital Growth Fund.    That's all turned around this year. All his metal-heavy funds have fallen in value, despite a more than 3% gain for the Sandamp;P. And the $32.2 million New England Zenith Capital Growth Fund has plunged nearly 13% through May 26-ranking 1,248 of the 1,482 funds tracked by Lipper Analytical Services Inc.    Mr. Heebner concedes: &quot;I'm in one of my underperformance modes -- it's a plain fact.&quot;    He has had other bad periods before -- lagging the market for several quarters in 1983 and 1984 -- and he naturally expects the funds' returns to rebound. But his recent performance illustrates the potential pitfalls of concentrating on only a few issues, and shows that even star fund managers take some lumps.    Mr. Heebner has one of the best long-term track records of any fund manager around. For the 10-year period ended March 31, his Loomis-Sayles Capital Development Fund and New England Growth Fund are ranked two and three behind Fidelity Magellan, gaining more than 810% and 773%, respectively, in that time. His investment philosophy: Buy a concentrated number of issues. &quot;Why dilute the potential of a good idea?,&quot; a recent Loomis-Sayles report says. He currently owns about a dozen stocks in each portfolio; his funds typically contain as many as 25.    &quot;Ken is an avid competitor and is willing to take an extreme position,&quot; says Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical. He notes, for instance, that Mr. Heebner dabbled brilliantly in Home Shopping Network when few of his fund peers would play with it.    He beefed up cyclicals -- particularly aluminum, copper and steel issues -- to 60% of the New England Zenith Capital Growth Fund by year-end, believing that price increases for those commodities would translate into higher earnings. Profits did rise, but the aluminum and copper stocks didn't, and the fund took a beating.    So Mr. Heebner recently has largely rid his portfolios of metals issues, retaining only some steel stocks such as Birmingham Steel, Oregon Steel and Inco. Meantime, he has added several new issues, including IMC Fertilizer Group. &quot;The farm situation we're seeing here is going to create higher prices for fertilizers as grain prices rise world-wide,&quot; he says. Other new additions: Amdahl, UAL and Tyco Toys.    More important, he has boosted his cash position from zero to 40% -- the largest reserve he has ever held -- amid wariness about the stock market. He will continue to worry about stocks, he says, until the budget and trade deficits are resolved. (High cash reserves buffer a fund in a down market, but can be a drag on performance when stock prices rise.)    Fund specialists say Mr. Heebner probably will move swiftly if his market view changes. Mr. Lipper expects, for instance, that he will &quot;commit the whole thing -- going to 99% of what he can invest in -- very quickly.&quot;    For now, Mr. Heebner says he's not sure whether he will stash away more cash. Meanwhile, he jokes that he could have several more quarters of underperformance before turning around, if history is any guide. &quot;I've had as many as five bad quarters in a row, so it might be too early&quot; to expect a rebound, he quips. </TEXT></DOC>
