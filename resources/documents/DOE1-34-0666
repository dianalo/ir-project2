The most effective process of therelease of solid particles from a cometary nucleus is their ejectionby sublimating gases when the comet approaches the Sun. The results ofinvestigation of the Geminids and Quadrantids meteor stream evolutionshow that under the influence of planetary perturbations, the streammay originally be flat but then thicken depending on the variation rangeof orbital inclinations. Eventually, due to planetary perturbations,a meteor stream may take such a shape as to cause the start of severalactive showers at different solar longitudes.</TEXT></DOC>
