At the top of the list is Philip Morris Cos.' $11.4 billion bid for Kraft Inc. But six other takeover bids or restructurings currently on the table each exceed $2 billion.    For takeover speculators, this flurry of big deals is turning 1988 into one of their best years ever. Arbitragers' gains this year have typically amounted to 40% to 60%, according to one survey, compared with a mere 13% rise in overall stock market indexes. And some top arbitragers privately say they are doing far better. &quot;It makes up for the baths that a lot of people took in last year's crash,&quot; says an arbitrager at a large Wall Street firm.    This takeover boom also means that other investors may still find some zip in takeover stocks -- even after arbitragers have taken their fill of shares. That's because &quot;the buying power of the arbitrage community is nearing capacity,&quot; Mr. Gottesman says. As some shareholders sell some of their takeover-stock holdings to take immediate profits, arbitragers are hard-pressed to absorb all those shares. So some takeover stocks currently are selling at greater discounts than usual to the acquisition price.    One example of the steeper discounts is Farmers Group Inc., which has agreed to be acquired by B.A.T Industries PLC for $75 a share. That transaction is due to close Dec. 16, but Farmers stock was quoted yesterday at $71.875, appreciably below the B.A.T offering price. As arbitragers calculate it, that provides a 25% annualized return for holding Farmers stock until B.A.T makes its payout -- considered a near certainty.    Another example cited by arbitragers is Macmillan Inc., which is being sought both by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. and British publisher Robert Maxwell. Macmillan closed yesterday at $87.875, though both KKR and Mr. Maxwell are offering slightly more than $90 a share. The KKR offer could pay out to shareholders in as little as three weeks, one arbitrager believes, yielding an annualized return of 39%.    And the profit opportunities now include transactions such as stock buy-backs that aren't takeovers. &quot;You can make a lot of money in the smaller transactions,&quot; says Hugh Lamle, executive vice president of M.D. Sass Investors Services Inc., which has $200 million invested in arbitrage strategies. He cites recent stock buy-backs by Schlumberger Ltd. and CSX Corp., which provided high annualized returns even though they were at small premiums to the market price.    But professional arbitragers have several advantages over smaller investors. Their commission costs to trade stocks are much lower, which makes a big difference in the rapid portfolio turnover that's required in playing takeover stocks. Also, arbitragers devote big resources to spotting problem deals -- and getting out. Without that, less experienced investors have often found takeover stocks to be a minefield.    Estimates of the arbitrage community's total buying power vary widely, though most center around $10 billion. Market participants generally agree that the amount of money devoted to takeover stock speculation is down about 20% from peak levels in 1986, just before the downfall of the powerful arbitrager Ivan Boesky. The biggest arbitrage players currently are securities firms such as Bear Stearns Cos. and Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., as well as private partnerships such as Kellner DiLeo andamp; Co. and Amster andamp; Co.    &quot;We've always been big in arbitrage,&quot; says Alan C. Greenberg, chairman of Bear Stearns. &quot;Relative to two months ago, we have more money in it. But our funding is elastic.&quot; He wouldn't disclose Bear Stearns' current arbitrage commitments, but did say, &quot;When there are lots of deals, we have lots of money in it.&quot;    In general, Wall Street is upbeat these days about takeover stocks. &quot;It's great times for the arbitrage community,&quot; says Martin Weinstein, managing director of Kubera, a midsized New York arbitrage partnership. He's particularly glad to see &quot;the return of the corporate buyer, instead of financial engineers&quot; as the bidders for companies, reasoning that deep-pocketed suitors such as Philip Morris are more likely to carry out their acquisition plans.    And in Bellevue, Wash., Michael Dunmire, a former pension consultant at Frank Russell Co., has opened his own firm, Paradigm Partners, to advise pension funds on nontraditional investment opportunities such as arbitrage partnerships. Even though outside investors generally must pay management fees of 20% or more of profits, arbitrage investments often provide higher returns than other stock market strategies, Mr. Dunmire says.    But veteran takeover stock speculators say their business isn't known as risk arbitrage for nothing. &quot;There's always the specter of another financial collapse,&quot; or possible market risks connected to the government's investigation of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., which has financed many takeovers, says Mr. Gottesman. &quot;That's why people have lowered their use of leverage this year, and are trying to pick out only top-quality deals.&quot;    ---                     Arbitragers' Plate                                            VALUE    TARGET         SUITOR            (In billions)    Kraft          Philip Morris            $11.4    Pillsbury      Grand Met                  5.2    Farmers Group  B.A.T                      5.2    Kroger         recapitalization    4.4 to 4.8    Interco        Rales brothers             2.7    Polaroid       Shamrock                   2.4    Macmillan      KKR, Robert Maxwell        2.3</TEXT></DOC>
