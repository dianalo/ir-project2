The most positive event was the rapid approval of AZT, the only drug shown so far to significantly retard the progress of AIDS. AIDS has forced both researchers and regulators to face the stark fact that patients who are suffering and dying can't wait and won't wait for the system to operate as it has for 25 years, as a bureaucratic leviathan. Sign-carrying AIDS demonstrators on the streets of Manhattan made the point plainly: &quot;The FDA is killing us.&quot;    Partly in response, the agency, under the direction of Commissioner Frank Young, set regulations this year to make promising experimental drugs more quickly available to patients. The state of Massachusetts has received permission to use the first such drug, a new immune globulin to protect pregnant women exposed, for example, to German measles. In another sign of progress, the legislature of California created the country's first state-based drug-approval system. It is intended to fast-track the research ongoing in the state's many biotech companies. Seven drugs, four for AIDS and three for cancer, have already been submitted to the program for consideration. We felt like a voice in the wilderness when we started to write about the therapy-denial issue three years go, but these real gains show it is becoming widely recognized.    ---   Still, 1987 was also the year of TPA, the now-famous clot-dissolving drug for use on heart-attack victims. About 500,000 Americans die annually of myocardial infarction. (So far, some 21,000 Americans have died of AIDS.) The core of the controversy that developed over TPA stems from the fact that while a federal research team, involving 20 private and academic U.S. research centers, proved and hailed TPA's ability to open blocked coronary arteries in April 1985, the FDA system didn't approve the drug for general use until last month. During that 2 1/2-year interval, according to the American Heart Association's estimates, 3.75 million heart attacks occurred, resulting in 1.35 million fatalities. Absent some compelling reasons, such a delay seems to us ethically indefensible.    We have of course written extensively on this issue, particularly after an advisory committee recommended disapproval of TPA for general use last May. We wish to know exactly how such decisions were made, from fear they reflect procedures that are also delaying drugs for other dread diseases. New insight is now available, since the FDA has recently responded to our Freedom of Information filings for background material on the May meeting.    &quot;Safety was the first and most important issue,&quot; eight members of the advisory committee wrote in an Aug. 12 letter to this newspaper. The letter cited figures that TPA might cause bleeding into the brain and that at one dose level the incidence of bleeding &quot;may be as high as 4% or as low as 1.5% to 2%. . . .&quot; That higher and indeed disturbing rate of 4% is based on a statement made at the public hearing by the FDA's Dr. Raymond Lipicky, who said, &quot;In that 350 patients, 16 had intracranial bleeds.&quot; That is 4.6%. In a heated exchange, the drug's sponsor asserted that Dr. Lipicky's denominator was wrong, that the 16 bleeds occurred not in 350 cases but in more than 1,000.    The material recently supplied by the agency summarizes the results of a large number of TPA studies. In no study does TPA display an incidence of cerebral hemorrhage above 2%. Asked about this in an interview last week, Dr. Lipicky now says the decision was based on such issues as TPA's dosage and manufacturing process. He dismisses the bleeding percentage as irrelevant: &quot;I can't remember how the denominator came to pass. But that wasn't the critical issue.&quot;    ---   Safety, indeed, may not have been the determining issue, to judge by another FOI document, an 84-page evaluation of TPA's research results performed by the agency's assigned medical reviewer, Dr. Abraham Karkowsky. Prior to approval, no one outside the agency saw Dr. Karkowsky's analysis. Had it been made public, the agency's intent to delay TPA would have been obvious. The plain fact is that the FDA staff wanted more studies done with more patients. In a word, delay.    Specifically, Dr. Karkowsky challenges whether opening a blocked artery saves the victim's heart: an &quot;agent which causes thrombolysis should be required to demonstrate a salutary effect on the outcome in patients. . . .&quot; Similarly, in the agenda questions the FDA provided the advisory committee. Question six: &quot;There has been no large randomized study comparing rt-Pa with any alternative treatment. If clot lysis is a persuasive endpoint for potential effectiveness, how does the lack of a controlled database affect your ability to render a risk/benefit assessment?&quot;    The point being made here is that there had been no large study in which TPA was &quot;randomized&quot; -- that is, given to some heart-attack victims, while others in the placebo group get nothing other than standard care. The NIH team in charge of the first TPA study said explicitly in its April 1985 report that it could no longer ethically withhold TPA from any patients in its study. So some 2 1/2 years later we discover that Dr. Karkowsky didn't like NIH's decision; he wanted data to match a large Italian study that led the FDA to approve another blood-clot dissolver, streptokinase. In the Italian placebo group, 758 people died.    Under the current system, the ethics of this process is never raised. There is no provision for discussing the immediate needs of critically ill patients. We are glad to see the beginnings of awareness with the AZT decision, the new experimental regulations and of course the ultimate approval of TPA. Even so, at the center of the FDA's world one finds &quot;databases,&quot; not patients lying in beds. Too often the quest is for the perfect statistical study, not aid to the ill. TPA is only one example. AIDS patients have raised this issue to a matter of national concern. And, if they had the time or energy, so too would cancer patients or victims of Alzheimer's disease. &quot;What about us!&quot; these people are screaming at the FDA. This country's patients deserve an answer. </TEXT></DOC>
