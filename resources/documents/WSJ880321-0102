Richard Fitzgerald, criminal court chief judge, quashed a subpoena seeking the name of the author of a controversial letter titled &quot;It's Over, Debbie&quot; that appeared in the magazine's Jan. 8 edition. The letter, purportedly written by a gynecology resident at an unidentified hospital, described the doctor's administration of a fatal dose of morphine to a young woman suffering from terminal cancer.    The Journal of the AMA said it published the dramatic account to stimulate debate on mercy killing, which it opposes. But the magazine said it hadn't checked the accuracy of the facts described in the letter and didn't know whether they were true. Nonetheless, AMA officials claimed the letter writer's identity was protected under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and the Illinois Reporter's Privilege Act.    In his ruling, Judge Fitzgerald said Cook County State's Attorney Richard M. Daley hadn't shown a crime was committed and hadn't exhausted other sources of information. Mr. Daley subpoenaed the magazine last month, seeking the doctor's identity and other details for possible prosecution.    In a statement, Mr. Daley criticized the medical journal's editors for &quot;protecting the identity of a killer who may kill again -- indeed, who may have already killed again.&quot; A spokesman for Mr. Daley declined to say whether the investigation would continue. </TEXT></DOC>
