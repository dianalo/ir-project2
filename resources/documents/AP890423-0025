At least one state-run daily, meanwhile, broke an apparent newsblackout in the official press on the student demands fordemocratic reform.   The Science and Technology Daily, a newspaper for intellectuals,came out Sunday afternoon with a sympathetic but carefully wordedaccount of the gathering Saturday of 150,000 student demonstratorson Tiananmen Square.   A Chinese journalist said reporters from the paper threatened toquit during a stormy all-night debate that delayed publication ofthe paper, which usually comes out in the morning.   Further complications arose when the postal service refused todeliver the paper, and reporters wound up delivering the edition,students said.   Several students sought donations on Beijing street corners sothey could form their own paper.   ``Our movement is not to raise our salaries or get better jobsafter graduation,'' said one Qinghua University student in a speechto a crowd of about 200. ``It's for democracy and freedom. It's forthe country.''   Another student said they had collected more than 500 yuan,about $135, in two hours.   One person, asked why he donated 5 yuan, said ``I believe in thetruth. I believe people need to know what really happened atTiananmen Square.''   In China, the press is run by the government, which censors newsin its attempt to control the flow of information. The governmentviews the press as a tool of the Communist Party.   In an apparent effort to discredit the demonstrators, only themost violent aspects of the recent protests breaking out in severalparts of China have previously been reported.   Last week, newspapers reported in some detail protesters'attempts to break into the Communist Party headquarters in Beijing.They did not say that police beat and kicked students.   On Sunday, the official Xinhua News Agency and the state-runradio reported a violent clash in Xian, provincial capital ofShaanxi, during which ``mobs of lawless elements'' torched vehiclesand buildings.   The radio of Hunan province also reported that rioters in theprovincial capital, Changsha, broke windows and beat up policeduring a demonstration there.   Both violent protests also were reported on the nationallytelevised nightly news.   The Science and Technology Daily made no mention of violence.   Along with several photos of the students marching peacefully,it carried two articles on the Beijing demonstrations.   ``University students expressed a common feeling that day:continue the spirit of Hu Yaobang, carry forward the flags ofdemocracy and science and push forward the reforms ...,'' it wrote.   Hu Yaobang is the former Communist Party chief whose April 15death sparked the demonstrations. Hu was admired by intellectualsfor his reformist views and won sympathy when he was ousted frompower in 1987 for failing to stop pro-democracy student protests.</TEXT></DOC>
