And there are bound to be plenty of both now as 96 mostly free-world nations prepare the most ambitious recasting ever of the rules of international commerce: the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.    For the U.S., which still is struggling with a $100 billion-a-year trade deficit, the GATT talks are particularly important. The Bush administration is trying to ensure that world trade expands further -- and with it, the level of U.S. exports.    The negotiations begin in earnest next month in Geneva, and the U.S. already has an agenda in mind. &quot;The fish or cut bait stage is just about to start,&quot; says William Lane, senior trade specialist at Caterpillar Inc., which is hoping for agreements to slash foreign tariffs on construction equipment.    But the effort to open more markets, while benefiting many segments of the U.S. economy, will hurt others. Says Carla Hills, the White House trade representative: &quot;We're willing to put our protections on the table, as long as our partners are prepared to put theirs up also.&quot;    Specifically, the U.S. is particularly seeking more open trade in agriculture, services, telecommunications and other high-tech industries, as well as in capital goods. Beyond that, it wants to broaden the agreement to encourage foreign investment and to expand protection for copyrights, patents and other forms of intellectual property. After all, the U.S. is estimated each year to lose revenues of between $40 billion and $60 billion to intellectual piracy. Until now the agreement has generally covered only trade in manufactures, although it nominally extends to agriculture.    To help get what it wants from the GATT, though, the U.S. and other industrialized nations will have to make some concessions themselves. And the likely candidates for sacrifice are traditional industries with longstanding import protections, such as steel and textiles. The Bush administration implicitly acknowledged its readiness to make the trade-off when it recently signaled its intention to end steel quotas no later than March 31, 1992.    But the U.S. will have to be willing to make further concessions. As a South Korean negotiator remarked to a U.S. official recently: &quot;You want to bring new areas into the GATT? Then bring the old ones back to the GATT, too.&quot;    A meaningful agreement will be attained only with the backing of large, newly industrializing and developing countries, such as Brazil, India, South Korea and Mexico -- countries seeking a larger role in industries that advanced countries currently protect. Indeed, the present GATT round is named after a developing country, Uruguay, where these talks first began in 1986.    The U.S., which has played a lead role in the GATT ever since it helped create the organization in 1947, has other items on its wish list: an improved mechanism for settling trade disputes, for instance, and agreements to cut back subsidies and protectionist local procurement policies. &quot;It's a quantum leap for the GATT,&quot; says Warren Lavorel, chief U.S. negotiator in Geneva. For the good of all participating nations, the Uruguay round has to succeed, Mr. Lavorel says, quoting a colleague who quips that &quot;we're doomed to success.&quot;    But while some less efficient parts of the U.S. steel and textile industry might be hurt by a greater opening up of world markets, there are huge potential benefits in other areas. For one thing, U.S. consumers would benefit from lower prices for steel and textiles. And many U.S. companies would be winners if the Uruguay round succeeds.    For example, the U.S. has the potential to expand exports of pharmaceuticals. But all too often U.S. pharmaceutical companies find their expensive research and development work stolen by companies in other countries, depriving them of research and development costs that can total one-quarter of a drug company's revenue. &quot;For us patent protection is essential,&quot; says Harvey Bale, senior vice president, international, at the Pharmaceuticals Manufacturers Association.    Mr. Bale acknowledges that some hard bargaining lies ahead. &quot;A multilateral solution is preferable,&quot; he says, &quot;but it isn't clear that a multilateral solution will be forthcoming if the Indians, the Brazilians and others won't agree.&quot;    U.S. officials had feared that large developing nations would seek to block attempts to include new areas in this round of talks. But now such concerns seem unfounded. Even India has made a proposal covering intellectual property.    ---@ GATT's Rounds 1947 -- General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade signed by 23 countries in Geneva.    1947-1962--Periodic rounds of talks aimed at cutting specific tariffs.    1964-1967--Kennedy round. Moved toward across-the-board tariff reductions on industrial products.    1973-1979--Tokyo round. Subsidies and other non-tariff barriers discussed seriously for first time.    1986-1990--Uruguay round. Launched to extend trade liberalization and to widen the treaty to include services, intellectual property and other areas. Ninety-six countries are now members. </TEXT></DOC>
