New party General Secretary Jiang Zemin also met two foreigndelegations, from Romania and Ethiopia, in a show of diplomacy asusual despite icy relations with Western governments protestingChina's bloody suppression of unarmed demonstrators.   Every major daily newspaper carried lengthy articles Monday onthe expulsion and other punishment of party members caughtembezzling, profiteering and abusing their power.   An end to official corruption was one of the calls of student-leddemonstrators. They also demanded freedom of the press and adialogue with government officials.   The People's Daily, official mouthpiece of the 47.7million-member party that is the world's biggest politicalorganization, said 452 officials in the southern province of Guizhouwere expelled for corruption in the first half of 1989.   On Sunday, it was reported that a local party leader in Guizhouwas sentenced to death for selling bootleg liquor.   The government, which ordered troops into Beijing on June 3-4 tocrush the student movement, now has seized the corruption issue asits own.   ``The recent turmoil and rebellion included many people becausesome party members, cadres and especially a minority of leaders wereengaged in corrupt practices which made the people verydissatisfied,'' the People's Daily said.   ``Organizers of the rebellion used anti-corruption slogans toincite the uncertain public,'' it said.   Among other cases reported Monday, the vice chairman of thecommodity prices committee in western Gansu province was expelledfrom the party for making $170,000 by profiteering in sugar.   Another Gansu official was punished for using public funds to buya private home and a third sold state-supplied medicine and used themoney to hold an elaborate funeral for his wife.   The Worker's Daily said a 32-year-old worker in central China'sShanxi province will be executed for embezzling $219,000 in publicfunds.   Guangming Daily said party members in Inner Mongolia must admitvoluntarily to all corrupt activities and that 450 people have beenarrested since a corruption reporting center opened in Shanghai ayear ago.   State TV gave prominent coverage to new party boss Jiang Zeminmeeting Monday with delegations Communist parties from Romania andEthiopia.   Xinhua News Agency said Jiang thanked the Romanian party for itsunderstanding and support ``at a time when China is confronted withtemporary difficulties.''   Jiang, former party chief in Shanghai, was named party chief lastmonth after Zhao Ziyang was purged of party posts for opposing theuse of force.   Xinhua also quoted Peng Chong, vice chairman of China'slegislature, as expressing ``sincere thanks'' to the ambassador ofNorth Korea for supporting China's handling of the``counterrevolutionary conspiracy.''   Almost all high-level diplomatic contacts between China and theWest have been frozen because of the military attack on protestersand arrests of more than 2,000 people across the country.   China continued to attack the United States on Monday, with theBeijing Daily saying the United States, with its discriminationagainst blacks and other minorities, has no right to condemn China'shuman rights record.   The article criticized President Bush, who visited Beijing inFebruary ``in the role of an old friend of China,'' for invitingdissident Fang Lizhi to a banquet attended by senior Chinese leaders.   Fang, who was turned away from the banquet by police, took refugein the U.S. Embassy following the crackdown. The government has puthim on a wanted list for counterrevolutionary crimes.   The People's Daily commentary stressed student protesters needgreater ideological education but will not be punished, while thosewho led the movement ``will not be forgiven.''   In the West, a leading Chinese dissident was quoted Monday assaying that senior leader Deng Xiaoping could order thousands ofexecutions. Twenty-seven people have been executed in China sinceJune 4, many of them student leaders. Others executed were commoncriminals.   ``Deng now will, so I believe, have thousands of people killed,first the students, then the intellectuals,'' said Yan Jiaqi, formerdirector of the Beijing Institute of Political Studies, in the WestGerman magazine Der Spiegel. It said its reporters spoke to Yan inParis, where he fled last month.   Monday's editions of the Paris newspaper Le Monde quoted Yan assaying: ``The cruelty of Deng Xiaoping goes way beyond that of Mao(Tse-tung) and Chiang Kai-shek.   ``The massacre of June 4 was 10, 20, 100 times crueler than theCultural Revolution,'' he said. During the 1966-76 CulturalRevolution, ``people were suppressed with clubs, whereas today, theyuse tanks and rifles to gun down the crowd,'' Yan said.</TEXT></DOC>
