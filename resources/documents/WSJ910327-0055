Unocal's decision is an important one in the history ofthe search for alternative fossil fuels. Parachute Creek wasthe first and only major commercial attempt to exploit whatare estimated to be more than 600 billion barrels ofrecoverable shale oil in the western U.S., about equal to theproven oil reserves of all of the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries.</LP><TEXT>   But even with substantial financial assistance from theU.S. government, Unocal was unable to turn a profit.   The bottom-line savings to the company of the shutdownwill be relatively small. Unocal's $650 million investment inthe facility has already been written down to zero. Thecompany had a loss on the project of about $22 million in1989 and about $7 million last year.   &quot;It was not off to an auspicious start this year,&quot; RichardJ. Stegemeier, Unocal's chairman, said in an interview. &quot;It'shad a pretty good run, but we just didn't see any way theselosses could be sustained.&quot;   By closing the operation, Mr. Stegemeier is sending acorporate sacred cow out to pasture. Unocal's late chairman,Fred L. Hartley, an engineer who wrote his college thesis onshale oil, was an enthusiastic proponent until he retired in1988. Unocal has been involved with shale oil technologysince the 1920s, when it began acquiring property in theParachute Creek area, about 200 miles west of Denver nearGrand Junction.   In the 1970s, the OPEC boycott had politicians calling forU.S. energy independence and analysts predicting oil priceswould surge to $100 a barrel. President Carter promised hugesubsidies for synthetic fuels development. Then oil pricescollapsed, and Exxon Corp. and Atlantic Richfield Co.abandoned their huge Colony project in 1982 before it wascompleted. Unocal pressed forward, however, going on-line in1984.   But Unocal didn't ship its first barrel of oil untilDecember 1986. When it finally did, the project was beingcalled &quot;Hartley's Folly.&quot; It never approached its original10,000-barrel-a-day capacity because of technical glitches.Part of the problem was that whenever production was gearedup above 6,500 barrels a day, mechanical breakdowns wouldoccur.   Moreover, even with government price supports totaling$114.5 million so far and potentially $400 million by 1996,the economics didn't make sense. This month, for instance,Unocal received $42.23 a barrel for oil produced at ParachuteCreek, but the government paid $23.46 of that. Meanwhile,Unocal's production costs were about $57 a barrel.   Although Unocal's announcement mentioned &quot;the possibilityof later recall&quot; of laid-off workers, analysts wereskeptical. &quot;You'll never see it open again,&quot; predictedFrederick P. Leuffer, a C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc.analyst who said he interpreted the closure as a signal thatUnocal management wants to boost its stock price, which hebelieves is undervalued. In New York Stock Exchange compositetrading yesterday, Unocal shares rose 87.5 cents to close at$27.25.   Mr. Stegemeier insisted Unocal wants to study the lessonslearned at Parachute Creek in the past six years, thenconsider reviving the project. He said there were no plans tosell the land or major assets.</TEXT></DOC>
