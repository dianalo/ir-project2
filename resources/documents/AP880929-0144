Schmoke of Baltimore advocatedthe legalization of illicit drugs to a House committee Thursday butreceived no support from lawmakers.   Fellow mayors who appeared as witnesses with him declined toendorse his recommendation for legalization but said the ideashould be researched, discussed and debated.   Schmoke told the Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Controlthat for the past 75 years the United States has considered illicitdrugs a law enforcement problem, a policy that has not reducedaddiction or crime.   ``It has been demonstrated that the criminal law enforcementsystem's ability to do anything about the medical problem ofaddiction is very limited,'' he said. And he said law enforcementhas not only failed to solve the problem of drug-related crime buthas worsened it.   ``Let us begin a phased-in process of fighting drug addiction asa public health problem, not as a crime problem,'' said Schmoke.   First, he said, would be the elimination of criminal penaltiesfor marijuana possession and the reallocation of money and manpowerfrom interdiction efforts to drug abuse programs.   Schmoke said his second recommendation would permit healthprofessionals to distribute methadone, heroin and cocaine toaddicts as part of supervised maintenance or treatment programs.   Thirdly, he would establish an independent commission to studysubstances of abuse, including tobacco and alcohol, and makerecommendations on how they should be regulated based upon theirpotential for harm.   ``If we are going to have a new war on drugs, I would ratherhave it led by the surgeon general and not the attorney general,''said Schmoke, a former prosecutor.   The heavily attended hearing was prompted by a speech andsubsequent television apprearances Schmoke made last spring inarguing for legalization and decriminalization of illicit drugs.   Mayors Edward Koch of New York, Donald C. Master of CharlesTown, W. Va., and Dennis Callahan of Annapolis, Md., opposedlegalization. Mayor Marion Barry of Washington, D.C., said hedidn't have an opinion on legalization but thought it should bediscussed and debated.   Committee Chairman Charles B. Rangel, D-N.Y., and membersBenjamin A. Gilman, R-N.Y., and Fortney H. Stark, D-Calif., alsoopposed legalization. Rep. James H. Scheuer, D-N.Y., said the issueshould be researched.   Koch said the suggestion that drugs should be legalized isshocking. ``In part because of the frustration some have had withthe difficult task of addressing the drug problem, the idea oflegalization has been elevated, undeservedly, to a place within therealm of debatable, if not potential, policy alternatives,'' hesaid.   ``When people say that we should legalize drugs because lawenforcement efforts have failed, they ignore the fact that a trulyeffective war has yet to be launched against drugs,'' said Koch.``What we really need to do is more, not less.''   Rangel, who has long opposed legalization, said he was concernedabout the impact of drugs on the future of the United States.   ``But unlike some of those have grown weary of this crisis, I amin no way ready to give up and say that we have fought the fightand have lost the war on drugs,' he said. ``I am not ready to giveup when we have yet to begin the fight. We have not even fired thefirst shot.''</TEXT></DOC>
