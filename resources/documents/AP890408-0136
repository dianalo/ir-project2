Until May 31, Parisians will be able to view 200 costumes, 46paintings and nine engravings covering Russia's prerevolutionaryperiod from 1700 to 1914. The Jacquemart-Andre Museum, formerly adingy mansion, has been refurbished to shine as splendidly as theczar's Winter Palace.   Saint Laurent, who was honored with his own fashionretrospective in the Soviet Union two years ago, was alsocelebrating the 225th anniversary of the Hermitage Museum.   ``This is a great example of glasnost,'' said Stephen de Pietri,the American curator of the show, referring to the ``openness''policy of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   ``Several years ago we wouldn't have been able to get sevencourt dresses as we did this time,'' he said. ``The Russians arejustifiably proud of these well-preserved costumes. They have donea fabulous job of preserving their heritage.''   A small room devoted to Peter I, who made St. Petersburg (nowLeningrad) into an 18th-century imperial city, displays severaloutfits that clothed the 6-foot-9 czar, a giant with slopedshoulders.   He might have worn the splendid red and blue cavalry dressoutfit during the battle of Poltava as he beat a path to water,opening up land-locked St. Petersburg to the sea. Standing alone,Peter's plain homemade boots bear witness to his do-it-yourselfcreativity as a young man who built boats as well as boots toescape boredom before he came to power.   Among the imperial costumes of Catherine 1, who plotted andsucceeded in marrying Peter the Great, were two outfits forreviewing the troops. One was green, for the Preobrajenski order,named after a hero, another red and blue equestrian outfit forpassing the cavalry in review.   Unlike her towering husband, Catherine, who was empress only twoyears (1725-27), was short and fat, wearing a big cloak to cover upmost of her girth.   The Russian love of Oriental opulence is woven throughout theshow, with silver and gold threads, amazing brocade embroidery,iridescent taffetas, jet beads, sequins and pearls. Red velvet,always a Russian favorite, is shown generously throughout. But theenormous rubies, emeralds and amethysts the Russian royals lavishedon themselves have now been replaced by glass stones.   Only in the Soviet Union could one find the exquisite antiqueshawls on view, woven so finely in stained-glass colors that thethreads are barely perceptible. The price was heavy for the younggirls who wove the fabrics, who often went blind.   Yet the French fashion influence is obvious as well.   ``Peter the Great decreed that European styles would be worn atcourt,'' said Isabelle de Courreges, a spokeswoman for SaintLaurent. ``Everything about dressing was decreed, even the lengthof the trains.''   Many of the 19th-century outfits are nearly line-for-line copiesof what Parisians were wearing, from high-waisted French empirestyles to crinoline skirts and bustles. One tableau of ``TheImperial White Nights'' is a stunning succession of gossamer-lightsilvery embroidered dresses.   Going along with the modern dawn-to-dark philosophy, are twoconvertible dresses with separate tops, circa 1880. The daytimeversions sport frothy jabots for modesty at the the neck, while theevening tops have daring decolletages.   The show's mannequins are given an amazingly lifelike appearancewith period curls and coifs fashioned out of stiffened ``silkpaper,'' the work of two Parisian hair stylists.   While women might envy the extraordinary beauty of the elaboratedresses, men could covet some of the marvelous silk dressing gownsworn in off-hours.   Outfits from the top Russian couturiers Lamanova, Brissac andBoulbenkova are displayed alongside models by Poiret and Worth,favorite Paris designers at the turn of the century.   Children are not forgotten in the show. A lavishsilver-embroidered salmon pink velvet suit was a gift of Catherineto her adored grandchild, Alexander I.   Touching outfits for children that might have been worn byAnastasia and Alexis _ offspring of the last Czar Nicholas II _ arejust as elaborate as the grown-ups' clothes: a short silvery dressfor the little girl, an embroidered blue velvet suit for a boy.   A group of peasant ``fete'' dresses topped by cockscomb``kokoschnik'' (halo-headdresses) is just as rich-looking as thecourt styles, though with informal touches such as gay sashes andsuspenders with lace-trimmed ``sarafan'' or apron dresses.   The glittery folklore was reminiscent of the ``rich and happypeasant'' styles admired by Saint Laurent, and the inspiration forhis 1976 Ballets Russes collection.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PM Tues April 11</NOTE></DOC>
