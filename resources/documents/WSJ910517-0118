At least five protesters have setthemselves on fire, making this year's events unusuallygruesome.   But the students have failed to attract broad support,either from the middle class or labor, and the protests seemunlikely to lead to major changes in how South Korea isgoverned, as they did in 1987.</LP><TEXT>   Still, the protests have been the most extreme since 1987,sparked by the alleged beating death of a student by a squadof riot police in April. Radical students, whose numbers hadbeen dwindling, found more-moderate students, outraged by thedeath, attracted to their cause. The five self-immolationsthat followed -- four of the protesters died -- only added tothe fervor.   Outside the universities, South Korean citizens weredisturbed by the deaths, but that hasn't translated intosupport for the students. Broad public support of studentprotests in the spring of 1987 forced the government tointroduce democratic reforms. The public, while neverenthusiastic supporters of the government of Roh Tae Woo'sDemocratic Liberal Party, seems satisfied with the pace ofthose reforms.   The students likewise haven't been able to attract thesupport of labor, also a crucial factor in 1987. &quot;I have ahunch that the phenomenal increase in income over the pastthree years acted as a kind of shock absorber fordiscontent,&quot; says Chang Dal Joong, a political scientist atSeoul National University and a critic of government policy.&quot;They are unhappy with the system, but they can compromise.&quot;   In contrast with the spring of 1987, when the police andthe government covered up the torture and murder of a studentdissident, the government arrested the young riot policemenwho allegedly beat the 20-year-old college freshman. Theminister of home affairs, who is in charge of the police, wasasked to resign.   &quot;The government handled it so quickly on the criminallevel and the political level that the support {for theprotests} was defused,&quot; says a Western diplomat.   One reason the protesting students have been unable togather broad support is because they have troublearticulating what they want. They are calling for the ousterof President Roh, elected in a free and generally fairelection. That doesn't sit well with the public or even theopposition parties, who are instead demanding that thepresident appoint a new cabinet.   Political analysts say that could well happen, even asearly as next week, although presidential advisers are saidto be resisting the idea because it would be a sign ofweakness.   Despite the lack of support, the student protests willcontinue through June 10, the anniversary of President Roh's1987 party nomination. In the past, the protest seasonclimaxed with the anniversary of the mid-May 1980 Kwangjuincident, where at least 200 people -- the opposition putsthe toll much higher -- were killed by government troopsquelling a riot.   &quot;We still have no reason to believe that it won't peterout by the end of the traditional protest season,&quot; saidanother Western diplomat.   The appearance that South Korea is erupting into disorderwill heighten next month as labor strikes occur at many ofthe nation's largest companies. Many of the strikes could bedisruptive because the government has been asking companiesto hold wage increases to less than 10%, while real inflationis about 18%.   The most unusual, and disturbing, component of the lateststudent protests is the chain of self-immolations. The firstprotester to attempt suicide-by-fire remains in criticalcondition with severe burns. The government suggests that theincidents are the result of brainwashing, or &quot;mentaltraining,&quot; of susceptible protesters by hard-core radicals.But little is known about the students' frame of mind beforetheir suicides, and interviews with many students suggestcoercion was unlikely.   Oddly enough, the suicides may have reduced support forthe students' cause. When a respected professor at YonseiUniversity told his class that students committing suicidearen't martyrs, student pressure caused him to resign. Butparents and others support the professor's view.   &quot;It is just too much. It is unnecessary,&quot; said Kim BunHui, a Seoul housewife, of the deaths.</TEXT></DOC>
