Robert Wallach, who has been indicted in theWedtech scandal, says reporters were corrupted by ambitiousprosecutors who leaked information to them.   ``By the time I was indicted I was already convicted,'' saidWallach, who is accused of taking payoffs from Wedtech officials inexchange for influencing the awarding of government contracts.   ``I am an innocent man caught in this system,'' Wallach told theAssociated Press Managing Editors convention Friday. ``And you,every one of you, no matter how well-intentioned, played a part init.''   Wallach, a San Francisco lawyer who goes to trial Jan. 3 in NewYork on federal racketeering and conspiracy charges, also accusedreporters of slanting their articles by overlooking his record as arespected litigator.   Also speaking at the convention were former Democratic vicepresidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro and Wendell Phillippi,retired managing editor of The Indianapolis News.   Ferraro told the newspaper editors they crossed the line betweenthe public's right to know and an invasion of privacy in coveringher bid for the vice presidency in 1984.   When reporters were finished interviewing everyone they couldfind, including a janitor in a school where she once taught, ``theyfound nothing newsworthy,'' she said. ``I was what I said I was ...so they had to go after my family,'' she said, referring to herhusband's business dealings.   Phillippi was the one who made a telephone call on behalf ofRepublican vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle when Quaylewanted to join the National Guard years ago. Phillippi assailed hispeers Friday for letting what he called an editor's mistake stick.   ``I'm here as a defendant after being tried in the kangaroocourt in which some of you participated,'' the former APMEpresident said.   He said he was belittled, maligned, misquoted and harrassedafter the AP picked up a story from The Indianapolis News thatsuggested Phillippi made many calls on Quayle's behalf.   ``I made one call to one person,'' Phillippi said.   The AP corrected the story, but Phillippi said he was houndedfor weeks by newspaper reporters from around the country whocontinued to base their reports on the erroneous information.   ``How much are editors responsible for the pushiness of theirreporters?'' he said.   ``Ours is an honorable profession,'' Phillippi said. ``Pleaselet's keep it that way.''</TEXT></DOC>
