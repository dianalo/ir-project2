The decision by Dun andamp; Bradstreet Corp.'s softwaresubsidiary reflects a trend in which companies are trying todo their computing on networks of PCs rather than buying moremainframes.</LP><TEXT>   Dun andamp; Bradstreet Software, Framingham, Mass., said it willuse software tools from closely held Powersoft Corp.,Burlington, Mass., to develop what is known in the industryas &quot;client-server&quot; applications software. Client-servercomputing is one of the hottest trends in the softwarebusiness because it lets corporations use PCs and mainframestogether to improve operations and save money.   Esther Dyson, editor of Release 1.0, a New York-basednewsletter, said, &quot;This is where the action is. It's wherePCs meet the mainframe.&quot; She said that the spread ofclient-server computing heightens a trend to place &quot;more ofthe burden on PCs. Client-server is bad news for big iron,&quot;as mainframe computers are known.   In client-server computing, much of the actual computingis done on the client, usually a personal computer orworkstation. The client requests information from a data baseor communications help from a server. Depending on the job,the server may be a powerful PC, a midrange computer or amainframe.   Many information systems managers at big companies havefound it difficult to create client-server software, despitethe cost-saving advantages. &quot;Most information servicesorganizations, including Dandamp;B, don't have the know-how tobuild client-server applications,&quot; said Adam Rin, who followssoftware engineering for consultant Gartner Group, Stamford,Conn. Dun andamp; Bradstreet's use of the Powersoft tools &quot;allowyou to write software in a way an average mainstreamprogrammer can relate to.&quot;   John Landry, Dun andamp; Bradstreet Software's executive vicepresident and chief technology officer, said that Dun andamp;Bradstreet will develop software modules that will work withits existing mainframe software packages to let programmersdistribute jobs between the mainframe applications and thePCs.   For example, client-server applications might improvemanagement of late payments. At many companies, bookkeepersin accounts receivable must examine weekly mainframeprintouts of overdue payments and then start the process ofdunning deadbeats. If payments still haven't been receivedthe following week, the bookkeepers have to check back tofind the previous week's action before deciding what to donext.   With client-server software, the mainframe can send a listof late payers to a personal computer. The PC can then recordprevious actions and speed the process by which thebookkeeper takes the next step. Moreover, the PC can serve asa word processor, sending out letters or faxes. And the PCcan produce graphs of payment histories on screens, lettingthe bookkeeper see if the lateness is unusual, signalingserious problems.   Dun andamp; Bradstreet's software operations had $539 million inrevenue last year, mostly from selling mainframe softwarepackages costing $100,000 to $200,000 to track such businessessentials as payrolls, payables and receivables. The unit iscomprised of two mainframe software pioneers, McCormack andamp;Dodge Inc., which Dun andamp; Bradstreet acquired in 1983, and MSASoftware Inc., acquired in 1990.   Dun andamp; Bradstreet said it expects to start shippingclient-server software developed with Powersoft's tools bythe beginning of 1992. It declined to discuss pricing.   Powersoft is one of a handful of small companiesdeveloping software tools that will make it easier forprogrammers to develop client-server computing. Powersoft,which had $18 million revenue last year, said that over thenext five years, it expects $20 million in revenue from itsDun andamp; Bradstreet relationship.</TEXT></DOC>
