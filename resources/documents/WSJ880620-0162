The original musical, starring the Marx Brothers, opened on Broadway in 1925 and, after touring the country, was converted into their first motion picture. It also was one of the first &quot;talkie&quot; musicals. The current production is the show's first revival ever, partly, perhaps, because no printed text or score existed.    How do you re-create a musical that has no script, for which half the songs were not published, and which starred a comic team that was sui generis? The answer is, not easily, which is why director Douglas C. Wager deserves credit not only for a hilarious, spirited mounting of the piece, but for detective work worthy of Hercule Poirot or Sam Spade.    Six years ago Mr. Wager successfully resuscitated another George S. Kaufman vehicle for the Marx Brothers, &quot;Animal Crackers.&quot; That was duck soup, however, compared with putting together &quot;The Cocoanuts.&quot; Mr. Wager had Mr. Kaufman's draft of the first act, he located the Hollywood censor's version of the movie script, and in the Library of Congress he found the stage manager's copy of the Broadway show. From these he pieced together a workable script, but he still was left with the formidable task of reconstructing a musical score.    Though Mr. Berlin had his own music company, some eight of 16 songs were never published. Finding the songs and developing the orchestrations, which were done by Robert Fisher and Russell Warner, was a dismaying task. But perseverance paid off: In one instance it was discovered that the underscoring of the movie opening was actually the music for a set of lyrics that had turned up somewhere else.    In the end Mr. Wager has reconstituted what is the closest anyone could come to the original. It's a signal service. Marx Brothers movies are available to anyone, but not their stage shows. Now they too can have a new life, and as evidence we have not only &quot;The Cocoanuts&quot; but Mr. Wager's previous work on &quot;Animal Crackers,&quot; which is currently having a successful run at the Huntington Theater in Boston.    Watching &quot;The Cocoanuts,&quot; you realize what a period of creativity and naivete the 1920s were. Irving Berlin knew and admired the Marx Brothers. Previously he had written for revues -- &quot;The Ziegfeld Follies&quot; and &quot;The Music Box Revue&quot; -- and he thought it would be a good idea to have a book musical for Groucho and company. But the book musical, which was to become the predominant form in shows like Mr. Berlin's own &quot;Annie Get Your Gun,&quot; had just begun. So &quot;The Cocoanuts&quot; is a hybrid. It has a story all right, but it's also part revue.    In the 1920s, people were fond of exotic musical forms and &quot;The Cocoanuts&quot; has its share of them. Jungle numbers, for instance, were all the rage, so we have &quot;The Monkey-Doodle-Do.&quot; Spanish routines were also popular, which is the reason for &quot;Tango Melody.&quot; And there was the obligatory Charleston: in this case, &quot;Everyone in the World Is Doing the Charleston.&quot; These specialty routines, smartly choreographed by Baayork Lee, are interspersed happily and shamelessly into the plot line.    Yes, there is a plot: The '20s was the time of the Florida land boom. People were paying exhorbitant prices for lots that turned out to be three feet under water when the tide came in. It's this speculation that Mr. Kaufman satirized in &quot;The Cocoanuts.&quot; The Groucho character is a brazen con man who operates the Cocoanut Hotel and sells worthless real estate on the adjoining beach.    In the subplot, Harvey Yates (Henry Strozier) and Penelope Martyn (Ronnie Farer) purloin the jewels of a wealthy matron (the Margaret Dumont character played with tremendous verve by Halo Wines). The thieves pin the rap on the young hero (Bob Kirsh), who is engaged to the grande dame's daughter (Deanna Wells). At the conclusion, of course, the culprits are caught and the young lovers reunited.    Through it all the Marx Brothers characters go their merry way in full cry. Zeppo (Ralph Cosham) tap dances with the bellhops; Harpo (Charles Janasz) plays his harp while perched in a large moon in the sky; and Chico (Mitchell Greenberg) plays a full-fledged piano solo, trigger finger and all.    Meanwhile, Groucho (Stephen Mellor), complete with painted mustache and slouching gait, dispenses an endless stream of perfectly awful, marvelously funny puns. (Groucho pointing to a map: &quot;This land is next to the levee.&quot; Chico: &quot;That must be the Jewish part.&quot; Groucho: &quot;We'll pass over that.&quot;)    &quot;The Cocoanuts,&quot; in short, is a wild mixture of low comedy, verbal pyrotechnics, specialty routines and pleasant plot songs such as &quot;A Little Bungalow.&quot; Thanks to Mr. Wager's direction, the pace is fast, the comedy is played at face value without being camped up, and the actors portraying the Marx Brothers are reminiscent of the originals but not slavish imitations.    All in all, it's a carefree evening that transports us six decades into the past when no one cared whether every song fit the story or the jokes made sense. As I heard a man tell his wife walking up the aisle at the end of the show: &quot;That's the best nonsense I've seen in years.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
