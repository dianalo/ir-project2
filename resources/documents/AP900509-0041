Schools tend to emphasize silence and obedience over learningand offer few opportunities for the emotionally handicapped to workwith other children or learn social skills, according to the studyby researchers at Bank Street College of Education in New York.   Many other youngters are being mislabeled as emotionallydisabled simply because they are ``mad, bad, sad and can't add''and have thus gotten on the nerves of their teachers, the studyfound.   Some 400,000 students, less than 1 percent of the schoolpopulation, have been identified as having behavior disorders byschool authorities. But studies estimate the true proportion is atleast three to five times higher.   ``This suggests that at best somewhere between 10 and 30 percentof children in need are identified,'' said the report.   Youngsters with behavioral handicaps are entitled to specialeducation under federal law. But whether or not emotionallyhandicapped children get special help from their schools depends asmuch on available resources and local attitudes toward difficultbehavior as on students' needs, the report said.   The report also found that only one out of three emotionallydisabled students functions at or above grade level, and 42 percentdrop out.   The study, to be published later this month, was written by JaneKnitzer, Zina Steinberg and Brahm Fleisch.   It was based on questionnaires sent to state directors ofspecial education and mental health officials, visits to 26programs in 13 states, a review of literature in the field andinterviews with parents and educators from 1987 to 1989.   ``The report leaves me optimistic simply because such a reportfinally exists,'' said William Schipper, executive director of theNational Association of State Directors of Special Education.   ``This is a very tough group to educate, a high-cost group. Butthe state of practice is well, well behind what the research tellsus,'' he said.   The report singled out a few exemplary programs.   Golden Lake Elementary in Circle Pine, Minn., sends specialeducators into regular classrooms, allowing youngsters to stay withnormal peers.   Central Park East School in Harlem and elementary schools in NewHaven, Conn., Benton Harbor, Mich., and Prince George's County,Md., have begun reforms that help all students. Such schools tendto shy from labeling youngsters ``handicapped.''   States, for their part, need to reexamine policies, the reportsaid. In some states, for example, school districts are ``off thehook'' financially if a student is referred to a state facility.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Copies of the report can be obtained after May15 for $15 through Bank Street College of Education, 610 West 112thStreet, New York, N.Y. 10025; or through Citizens Committee forChildren of New York, 105 East 22nd Street, N.Y., N.Y. 10010.</TEXT></DOC>
