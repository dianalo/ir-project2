The deficit reduction assessment.</ITAG>Since the 1988-89 marketing year is the last of the three consecutive yearsfor which marketing quotas previously proclaimed on a poundage basis willbe in effect, section (319b) of the 1938 Act provides that the Secretaryshall proclaim marketing quotas for burley tobacco on a poundage basisfor the 1989-90, 1990-91, and 1991-92 marketing years. The determinations set forth in this notice have been made on the basisof the latest available statistics of the Federal Government. <ITAG tagnum="84">Marketing Quotas </ITAG>Section 319 of the 1938 Act provides, in part, that the national marketingquota for a marketing year for burley tobacco is the quantity of such tobaccothat is not more than 103 percent and not less than 97 percent of the totalof: (1) The amount of burley tobacco that domestic manufacturers of cigarettesestimate they intend to purchase on U.S. auction markets or from producers,(2) the average quantity exported annually from the U.S. during the threemarketing years immediately preceding the marketing year for which thedetermination is being made, and (3) the quantity, if any, necessary toadjust loan stocks to the reserve stock level. Section 319(a)(3)(B) furtherprovides that, with respect to the 1986 through 1989 marketing years, anyreduction in the national marketing quota being determined shall not exceedsix pereent of the previous year's national marketing quota. The ``reservestock level'' is defined in section 301(b)(14)(D) of the 1938 Act as thegreater of 50 million pounds or 15 percent of the national marketing quotafor burley tobacco for the marketing year immediately preceding the marketingyear for which the level is being determined. Section 320A of the 1938 Act provides that all domestic manufacturers ofcigarettes with more than 1 percent of U.S. cigarette production and salesshall submit to the Secretary a statement of purchase intentions for the1989 crop of burley by January 15, 1989. Six such manufacturers were requiredto submit such a statement for the 1989 crop and the total of their intendedpurchases for the 1989 crop was 427.0 million pounds.The three-year average of exports is 160.6 million pounds. This is basedon 1986 Census-reported exports of 165.3 million pounds, 1987 Census-reportedexports of 156.5 million pounds, and USDA-projected 1988 exports of 160million pounds. In accordance with section 301(b)(14)(D) of the 1938 Act, the reserve stocklevel is the greater of 50 million pounds or 15 percent of the 1988 marketingquota for burley tobacco. The national marketing quota for the 1988 cropyear was 473.4 million pounds (53 FR 18113). Accordingly, the reserve stocklevel for use in determining the 1989 marketing quota for burley tobaccois 71 million pounds. As of January 25, 1989 the two loan associations had in their inventory59 million pounds of 1985, 1986, and 1987 crop burley tobacco which remainedunsold (net of deferred sales). In addition, an estimated 12 million poundsof the 1988 crop was expected to be pledged as collateral for price supportloans. This amount is equal to the desired reserve stock level. Therefore,there wi1l be no adjustment to the reserve stock level. The total of the three marketing quota components for the 1989-90 marketingyear is 587.6 million pounds. Section 319 of the 1938 Act further providesthat the Secretary may increase or decrease the total by 3 percent. Sincethe total supply of burley tobacco is considered normal, the Secretarydid not exercise this discretion authority. Accordingly, the national marketingquota for the marketing year beginning October 1, 1989 for burley tobaccois 587.6 million pounds. In accordance with section 319(c) of the 1938 Act, the Secretary is authorizedto establish a national reserve from the national acreage allotment inan amount equivalent to not more than 1 percent of the national acreageallotment for the purpose of making corrections in farm acreage allotments,adjusting for inequities, and for establishing allotments for new farms.The Secretary has determined that a national reserve for the 1989 cropof burley tobacco of 1,066,000 pounds is adequate for these purposes. <ITAG tagnum="84">Price Support </ITAG>Price support is required to be made available for each crop of a kindof tobacco for which quotas are in effect, or for which marketing quotashave not been disapproved by producers, at a level which is determinedin accordance with a formula prescribed in section 106 of the 1949 Act.With respect to the 1989 crop of burley tobacco, the level of support isdetermined in accordance with sections 106 (d) and (f) of the 1949 Act.Section 106(f)(4) of the 1949 Act provides that the level of support forthe 1989 crop of burley tobacco shall be: (1) The level in cents per poundat which the 1988 crop of burley tobacco was supported, plus or minus,respectively, (2) an adjustment of not less than 65 percent nor more than100 percent of the total, as determined by the Secretary after taking intoconsideration the supply of the kind of tobacco involved in relation todemand, of: (A) 66.7 percent of the amount by which: (I) The average price received by producers for burley tobacco on the UnitedStates auction markets, as determined by the Secretary, during the 5 marketingyears immediately preceding the marketing year for which the determinationis being made, excluding the year in which the average price was the lowestin such period, is greater or less than (II) The average price received by producers for burley tobacco on theUnited States auction markets, as determined by the Secretary, during the5 marketing years immediately preceding the marketing year prior to themarketing year for which the determination is being made, excluding theyear in which the average price was the highest and the year in which theaverage price was the lowest in such period; and (B) 33.3 percent of the change, expressed as a cost per pound of tobacco,in the index of prices paid by burley tobacco producers from January 1to December 31 of the calendar year immediately preceding the year in whichthe determination is made. For the purpose of calculating the market-price component of the supportlevel, the 1949 Act provides that the average market price be reduced 3.9cents per pound for the 1985 marketing year and 30 cents per pound forprior marketing years. The difference between the two 5-year averages (the difference between(A)(I) and (A)(II)) is 0.7 cents per pound. The difference in the costindex from January 1 to December 31, 1988 is 8.2 cents per pound. Applying these components to the price support formula (0.7 cents per pound,two-thirds weight; 8.2 cents per pound, one-third weight) results in a3.2 cent increase in the level of price support from the previous year.Section 106(f)(8) of the 1949 Act provides that the price support levelfor the 1989 crop of burley tobacco will be reduced by 1.4 percent fromthe level otherwise determined in accordance with section 106 or that inlieu of such a reduction, an assessment be established in an amount thatwill realize a reduction in outlays which would have resulted from sucha reduction in the price support level. On February 1, 1989, the Secretaryannounced that an assessment of .34 cents per pound would be imposed withproducers and purchases of burley tobacco each being responsible for one-halfof this amount. Accordingly, the 1989 crop of burley tobacco will be supportedat 153.2 cents per pound. The level of support and the national marketing quota for the 1989 burleymarketing year was announced on February 1, 1989 by the Secretary of Agriculture.This notice affirms these determinations. <ITAG tagnum="84">Determinations 1989-90 Marketing Year </ITAG>Accordingly, the following determinations have been made for burley tobaccofor the marketing year beginning October 1, 1989:<ITAG tagnum="84">Proclamation of National Marketing Quotas </ITAG>Since the 1988-89 marketing year in the last of three consecutive marketingyears for which marketing quotas previously proclaimed will be in effectfor burley tobacco, a national marketing quota for such kind of tobaccofor each of the three marketing years beginning October 1, 1989, October1, 1990, and October 1, 1991 is hereby proclaimed.
