 I'm very impressed by the quality of individuals, both in thedepartmental offices and throughout the bureaus.andM;I really haven't made any significant organizational changes.andP;  I have arelatively small staff divided up into IRM and telecommunications management.andO;They were in place when I came in and they are intact today.andM;The bureaus operate with relative autonomy.andP;  Obviously, some bureaus havemore autonomy than others.andP;  We spend more time working with the largerbureaus, specifically the Internal Revenue Service, Customs Service andFinancial Management Service.andM;I don't expect to make many changes other than to continue to create anunderstanding of the need for a well-developed, well-conceived IRMorganization.andM;GCN: You background is diverse.andP;  What particular experience prepared you forthis job?andM;BROADBENT: All may professional experience in the Navy and at ATandamp;T [Co.],andO;plus my academic experience, has been in information technology.andP;  I spent themajority of my time at sea as a telecommunications officer performingcommunications intelligence functions.andP;  With ATandamp;T, it was always informationtechnology.andM;My undergraduate degree in nuclear engineering obviously has limited valuetoday, but if nothing else, it taugh me a very disciplined and logical methodof analysis applicable across any technology areas.andM;Since 1986, I've done advance work for President Bush on my vacation time andweekends and a little bit of time that ATandamp;T gave me.andP;  It has dovetailedneatly into this job.andP;  I have to admit when I started doing advance work Ididn't plan on ending up in a job like this, but good fortune has brought mehere and it sure has worked out well.andM;GCN: What type of oversight do you have over Treasury's 13 bureaus?andM;BROADBENT: The level of oversight we give to particular bureaus is based onthe size of the bureau, the budget assigned and wehther or not there arepresidential priority projects.andP;  Some bureaus' budgets are in excellentshape.andP;  They're well-funded.andP;  They have excellent professional staffs thatrequire very little oversight.andM;Others are equally well-organized and well-staffed, but the complexity oftheir mission requires involvement here because of interest from the GeneralServices Administration and Office of Management and Budget.andP;  We get involvedwith the bureaus as new projects come up.andM;We're looking for budget approval for those projects.andM;We're organized along the lines of desk officers who maintain oversight.andO;With the IRS, we have assigned two desk officers.andP;  A particular desk officer[also] may have multiple smaller bureaus.andM;GCN: Of all Treasury's IRM programs, which is the most vital and why?andM;BROADBENT: I think they're all vital.andP;  Information technology is an importantpiece of the success in any bureau, from the small ones to the large ones.andO;You can't say that IRS's mission of revenue collection is more important thanthe fiscal mission performed by the Bureau of the Public Debt and FMS infinancing the nation's debt and issuing the checks.andM;Enforcement of the nation's laws is equally important through Customs, SecretService, Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and IRS.andP;  In all these missions,technology plays a very important part.andP;  I would hate to single anybody out.andM;GCN: Treasury has three of the nine designated Presidential Priority Systems.andO;How do you explain your good fortune?andM;BROADBENT: We're lucky.andP;  The designation of a particular project as aPresidential Priority System raises the department's importance andvisibility in budgeting and planning.andM;Any time you can increase the probability that a program will receive fundingover a number of years, you're in better shape.andP;  You can never guarantee it100 percent, but being designated a Presidential Priority System certainlyhelps.andM;The other thing it does is increase visibility at the Office of Managementand Budget, General Accounting Office and other organizations.andP;  Not that welike getting reports and letters and audits, but if oversight agencies offerconstructive criticism and increase the probability of success, it's in thebest interests of the government.andM;Every now and then we get a report with destructive criticisms that don'tserve the government or increase the project's probability of success.andP;  But Ithink those cases are rare.andM;When somebody comes in with fresh eyes, you can gain a lot of suggestions onhow to improve your operations.andP;  I think that is healthy, particularly incomplex programs like the IRS information systems modernization.andP;  That has tobe one of the two most complex programs in the United States today in boththe public and private sectors, the other being the Federal AviationAdministration modernization program.andM;GCN: How is the IRS modernization faring?andM;BROADBENT: I think significant gains have been made in the last year just inplanning for modernization.andP;  The last major piece of the planning phase thatdefines the overall architecture will be released in a couple of months.andP;  Thearchitecture has been built by looking at how we can bring data to the lowestbut most effective point in the systems architecture.andM;GCN: Is there a date for overall completion?andM;BROADBENT: No.andP;  The program will be substantially complete in 1995-1996,depending on budget resources.andP;  That will very significantly depending on thecooperation we get from vendors as we proceed with the acquisition.andM;I think one of the largest obstacles we have in completing any majormodernization program, whether it's FMS SysSystem 90, the IRS modernizationor any other, is the complexity of the acquisition process.andP;  In my opinion,it has gone well beyond its intended effects to the point where it's a burdenon both us and the private sector.andM;I think we need to go back and take a look at specific goals.andP;  To me, thegoals of procurement are competition in contracting and maintainingintegrity, from both the government's standpoint and that of the privatesector--driving costs down to where the private sector makes a reasonablereturn but we can gain economies of scale in the government.andM;With those goals in mind, we need to go back and do an analysis of the goodand bad points of the Federal Acquisition Regulations and the otherregulations.andM;We need to bring control back to the federal government.andP;  I'll tell you rightnow, it's the vendors that are controlling the process.andP;  The vendors caneither ensure that we meet our time lines or they can make it nearlyimpossible to reach our goals.andM;If they use the appeals process to the letter of the law, they can dragthings out forever.andP;  If they apply the spirit and the intent of the appealsprocess, I think we can maintain our goals.andM;GCN: Where do your big requirements contracts stand -- the Treasury MultiuserAcquisitions Contract (TMAC) and Departmental Microcomputer AcquisitionContract (DMAC II)?andM;BROADBENT: Best-and-final offers have been received on DMAC II.andP;  Ourprocurement folks say we've got some very competitive bids.andP;  I think we'regoing to end up with excellent award.andP;  We've had a real clean process thisfar.andM;For TMAC, we will start live test demonstrations at the beginning of June.andO;Best-and-final offers currently are slated for September, with an award inNovember.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
