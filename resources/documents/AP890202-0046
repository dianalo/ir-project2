Officials attributed at least 13 deaths to the cold and drivingwinds that have paralyzed much of Western Canada since Monday.   Cold and blowing snow was blamed for eight deaths in Alberta,three in Saskatchewan and two in British Columbia. Among the deadwere six Edmonton men who suffered heart attacks after shoveling orpushing vehicles.   The snow that fell Monday and Tuesday in the Edmonton area wasthe heaviest January storm recorded there since Jan. 31, 1885.   Most roads and highways in Alberta were open on Wednesday,although about 20,000 residents in British Columbia's Fraser Valleywere without power due to high winds that blew trees and branchesonto the lines.   In Victoria, the fountain in front of the British Columbialegislature was frozen solid as the mercury dipped to 10 degrees onthe West Coast.   Temperatures remained around minus 22 on Wednesday throughoutSaskatchewan and Alberta, where the wind-chill factor made it coldenough to freeze exposed flesh in less than a minute.   ``What has happened the last couple days is quite spectacular,''said Andy Radomski of the federal Atmospheric Environment Service.   He said the air had a chance to cool longer than usual in thenorth because it was trapped by westerly circulation that kept mostof Canada warm much of the winter. The upper level winds thenshifted and forced the cold air south at last.   ``It has affected all of Western Canada and in fact is going tothe states and will affect them as well,'' Radomski said in atelephone interview.   Radomski said the weather pattern generally was heading south andsoutheast from Western Canada and was expected to hit hardest thePlains, the Lower Great Lakes and New England.   The cold air that lingered over Alaska for a week broketemperature records and resulted in at least one death.   On Monday, it was 51 below zero in Fairbanks, Alaska, and theNational Weather Service said there were unofficial reports oftemperatures of minus 75 in the state.</TEXT></DOC>
