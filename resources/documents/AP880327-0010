In fighting Friday, military officials in Manila said troopskilled 10 communist New People's Army guerrillas in Luzon island'sAlbay province. They said one soldier was killed in the encounter.Other rebel violence Thursday and Friday left at least a dozenother people dead.   Mrs. Aquino flew to Mindanao island to inaugurate the commissionafter the largest Moslem rebel group failed to win full membershipin the Organization of Islamic Conference but obtained assurancesof continued support from the influential bloc.   Communist insurgents, fighting the government for 19 years, arereported to have struck alliances with some Moslem extremists onMindanao.   Hundreds of soldiers armed with automatic rifles and grenadelaunchers guarded the Saturday's inauguration ceremonies, held in agovernment complex on the outskirts of Cotabato City, a mixedMoslem-Christian city 560 miles southeast of Manila.   At least six people were killed in clashes Friday betweenmembers of the rival Moro National Liberation Front and the MoroIslamic Front south of the city. The two groups, which split in themid-1970s, have been fighting for Moslem rule on Mindanao and othersouthern islands for more than 15 years.   On Thursday, about 200 Moslem rebels attacked two villages inthe Mindanao province of Zamboanga del Sur, killing six militiamenand burning hundreds of houses, military officials said.   Through decades of migration from Luzon and the Visayas islands,Christians now outnumber Moslems in 17 of the 22 provinces onMindanao and the Sulu island chain. The region is the homeland ofthe Philippines' estimated 5 million Moslems.   The commission is to hold public hearings to determine theextent of autonomy to be granted the region. It will also help laydown the administrative framework that will govern the region.   Of the commission's 44 members, 21 are Christians. The rest areMoslems or members of tribes belonging to neither faith. Rebelgroups are not represented in the body.   The Moslem separatist revolt broke out in the southernPhilippines a few weeks after then-President Ferdinand Marcosimposed martial law in September 1972. The fighting peaked in 1974and, according to official estimates, claimed more than 50,000lives by 1976.</TEXT></DOC>
