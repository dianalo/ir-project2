Officials of Tonen Corp. charged that Yamaichi SecuritiesCo. traded bonds for the Japanese oil refiner without itsconsent in order to compensate Tonen for investment losses.Meanwhile, Hanwa Co., a major steel-trading concern that hasoften boasted of its skillful investment techniques, hasturned out to be one of the biggest corporate beneficiariesof the compensation payments.</LP><TEXT>   In Tonen's case, Yamaichi brokers used accounts held bythe refiner's New York-based subsidiary, Tonen EnergyInternational, to make a series of unapprovedconvertible-bond transactions that resulted in an unusualprofit for the refiner, Tonen managing director TakuyaFujimura said at a news conference.   Tonen officials also said they weren't aware of thecompensatory payments, which totaled 293 million yen ($2.1million), according to the lists released Monday by the JapanSecurities Dealers Association.   Mr. Fujimura expressed anger that his company's nameappeared on the list, and stressed that Tonen doesn't haveany &quot;broker discretion&quot; accounts, which many analysts believeto be the root of the compensation scandal that has engulfedthe Japanese stock market. Mr. Fujimura said Tonen hadcomplained to Yamaichi and suspended all transactions withit.   Yamaichi officials confirmed that they conducted theprofitable trades for the oil refiner, but declined to givedetails about the transactions. A Yamaichi spokesman said thebrokerage firm was sorry for embarrassing Tonen, but stressedthat Yamaichi brokers didn't engage in any transactions onthe company's behalf that violated Japanese law.   &quot;Tonen did not seek compensation from us,&quot; the spokesmansaid. &quot;We exercised our own judgment in executing the tradeson their behalf.&quot;   In Hanwa's case, Yamaichi and Nikko Securities Co. paid acombined total of 7.8 billion yen to the steel-tradingconcern and five affiliates to compensate them for losses onsecurities investments. While it is difficult to determinewhich Japanese company was the largest recipient ofcompensation payments, Hanwa is among the biggest, if not No.1. An Hanwa spokesman on Tuesday stressed that the companywas unaware of such payments, saying, &quot;The brokerage firmsdid them alone internally&quot; without notifying Hanwa.   Hanwa has a reputation for making substantial sums throughfinancial investment. For the year ended March 31, itreported pretax profit of 37.7 billion yen, two-thirds ofwhich stemmed from financial investments.</TEXT></DOC>
