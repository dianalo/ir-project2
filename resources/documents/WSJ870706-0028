De Lorean's former auto assembly plant in Belfast to an English furniture maker.    The board said the announcement, which was to have been made Friday morning, was called off &quot;to allow for further appraisal of the project.&quot; Details weren't available and a spokesman for the board said it wasn't clear whether the transaction would ultimately go through.    Earlier, the board said London Refurbishing Co. was buying the 70-acre industrial complex for an undisclosed sum. The plant stopped building cars in late 1982 after going into receivership earlier that year amid serious financial problems at De Lorean Motor Co.    London Refurbishing has said it plans to retool the plant for automated furniture manufacturing and assembly. The company supplies furniture for hotels, pubs, restaurants, schools and hospitals in more than 30 countries. </TEXT></DOC>
