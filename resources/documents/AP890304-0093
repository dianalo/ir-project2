In the occupied Gaza Strip, the army restricted access forreporters while British Foreign Office Minister William Waldegravetoured the Jabaliya refugee camp. At least two Palestinians werereported shot and wounded in violent protests that broke out afterthe visits.   Angry activists of the Peace Now movement accused DefenseMinister Yitzhak Rabin of thwarting the meetings with Palestiniansin Arab towns.   ``We weren't planning assemblies or marches or protests _ justmeetings,'' said Peace Now spokesman Tsali Reshef.   One of the activists, Yochanan Spruch of Jerusalem, called thegovernment ``plain stupid.''   Reshef called a Defense Ministry spokesman and demanded anexplanation for closing the roads. He quoted ministry spokesmanEitan Haber as saying Peace Now did not receive permission for thevisit.   Parliament member Ran Cohen accused Rabin of bowing to pressurefrom right-wing Jewish settlers who oppose the peace meetings.Settlement leaders launched a campaign Friday to stop the meetingsand urged Rabin to block the contacts, saying they would encourageterrorism.   A Defense Ministry official who demanded anonymity said the armywas concerned Jews would clash with fellow Jews if the meetings tookplace.   Five separate convoys of Israelis left Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Haifaand Beersheba for West Bank villages early on the Jewish Sabbath,and all were stopped by army roadblocks, activists said.   In one case, activists headed for southern Hebron abandoned theircars at army roadblocks and walked to the village of Beit Sahour,where they held an impromptu peace rally, Israel Radio said.   After the Israelis left, one Palestinian was shot and wounded inclashes with troops, a photographer said.   ``Defense Minister Rabin is ready to let 365 days go by in whichthere are dead and wounded on both sides, but he won't let even oneday go by in which the two sides talk to each other,'' said Cohen,of the leftist Citizens Rights Movement.   On the outskirts of Ramallah, a military officer blocked the roadwith his jeep to cut off a convoy from Jerusalem. The officer toldconvoy drivers that the area was a closed military zone, but troopsthen waved on local Arabs and Jewish settlers.   Members of Peace Now, which calls for Israel to change its policyand negotiate with the banned PLO, have held numerous meetings withPalestinians both inside Israel and abroad. Several activists havemet with PLO officials in Europe, ignoring the Israeli law barringcontacts with the PLO.   Peace Now said it has been in contact with underground leaders ofthe anti-Israeli revolt and coordinated the meetings with theirapproval. At least 388 Palestinians and 17 Israelis have been killedin the nearly 15-month uprising against Israeli rule.   Palestinian leaders in Ramallah distributed a leaflet directingfollowers not to attack cars with Peace Now signs.   In the occupied Gaza Strip, Waldegrave toured the Jabaliyarefugee camp and said Britain would contribute $870,000 to the U.N.Relief and Works Agency, to benefit Palestinian refugees. Reporterswere not allowed to accompany him while he visited the camp outsideGaza City.   In a brief news conference following the tour, Waldegrave saidthe continued military occupation was an ``utter impossibilty.''Israel gained control of the territories in the 1967 Middle East war.   After Waldegrave's departure, troops wounded a Palestinian in theleg during a stone-throwing clash, an Arab reporter in Gaza said.</TEXT></DOC>
