U.S. District Judge Robert L. Carter, hearing the case againstfive members of a small investment firm who were indicted onracketeering charges last month, asked attorneys on Tuesday topresent legal briefs on the issue before he makes a ruling.   The case against the defendants, partners in Princeton-NewportPartners, a small investment firm based in Princeton, N.J., hasattracted widespread interest because they are the first securitiesprofessionals ever to be indicted under the Racketeer Influencedand Corrupt Organizations law.   Convictions under that law carry enormous financial penaltiesand in this case could possibly put Princeton-Newport out ofbusiness, although it and other unindicted partners have not beenaccused of any crime.   Lawyers following the case have said its implications also aresignificant because of a similar indictment that could emergeagainst Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the giant Wall Streetinvestment firm accused by the Securities and Exchange Commissionof widespread securities fraud.   Drexel has denied those accusations. But if it or any Drexelemployees was indicted under the racketeering law, a freeze onDrexel assets could seriously compromise and possibly cripple thefirm's ability to do business.   Last week, a federal appeals court said the government couldplace controls on Princeton-Newport's assets to preserve propertythat might have to be forfeited should the defendants be foundguilty of the racketeering charges. But the appellate court alsoreturned the case to a lower court for more consideration.   Federal prosecutors argued before Carter on Tuesday that thegovernment should be able to reach beyond the indicted parters'personal assets and their interest in Princeton-Newport, shouldthose assets fall short of the amount the government wants to setaside for possible forfeiture.   That amount has not been disclosed but is believed to be between$30 and $50 million.   Defense attorneys have said only their clients interests in thepartnership could be subject to forfeiture.   A federal grand jury in August indicted five Princeton-Newportpartners and a former Drexel trader on charges they engaged in aracketeering conspiracy to create illicit tax losses through phonystock deals.   The Manhattan U.S. attorney's office has said it expects toissue a new indictment against them in late November, which wouldreplace the earlier indictment, but has not given details.</TEXT></DOC>
