The solution ofthis problem is reduced to satisfaction of two conditions such as: waterconfinement over the reactor core necessary in case of an accident andconfinement of sufficient coolant flow rate through the bottom crosssection of fuel assemblies for some time. The reliable fuel element coolingunder conditions of a maximum credible accident (brittle failure of areactor vessel) is shown to be provided practically in any accident,using the safety vessel in combination with the application of meansof standard operation and minimal composition and capacity of ECCS.</TEXT></DOC>
