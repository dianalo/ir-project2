Damage after X-rays alonewas expressed late, with no functional changes earlier than 5 months.CY alone, by contrast, caused a marked increase in urination frequencyand haematuria within one week. There was subsequently partial recoveryalthough some residual damage persisted for at least one year. CY givenbefore or after X-rays caused an early, X-ray dose-related expressionof damage. These results suggest that the drug precipitated some of thelatent radiation injury. There was also a second wave of damage afterthe combined treatments and the response at 9-12 months was always moresevere than after X-rays alone. This increased late damage could be explainedin terms of additive drug and radiation toxicities. Since drug givenup to 9 months before or after irradiation caused more severe bladderdamage than X-rays alone, CY should be avoided in clinical situationswhere the bladder has been irradiated. 27 refs.; 8 figs.; 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
