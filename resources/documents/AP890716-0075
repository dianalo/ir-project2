Leaders ending a three-day summit called for stronger steps tosave rainforests, the atmosphere, and the seas, lakes and rivers,saying species were endangered and societies threatened by damage.   The environment must win a higher place on the agenda of economicdecision-makers, they said at the conclusion of the first summitthat gave such priority to environmental issues.   Defending Japan, spokesman Taizo Watanabe angrily attackedcriticism of his country's record on the environment, tellingreporters that Japan was not guiltless but was trying to change.   While credited with cleaning up its own pollution, Japan has beenviewed as a black sheep among nations environmentally for itsreluctance to give up whale hunting and its prodigious use oftropical rainforest products and chlorofluorocarbons that destroythe earth's protective ozone layer.   Recently, however, Japan has begun making changes, includingsharp increases in spending to protect the environment.   The fact that Japanese officials devoted a news conference solelyto environmental issues spoke of the country's new emphasis.   Another sign was the $2.25 billion in environmental-related aidto developing nations that Japanese Prime Minister Sousuke Unounveiled before the meeting.   ``I resent very much this kind of perception that Japan must bethe villain in destroying the precious environment,'' Watanabe said.``Japan is behind no nation in its concern for the environment.''   Watanabe acknowledged that Japan is the largest importer of woodfrom the threatened rainforests but said ``that is something wewould like to cope with by extending cooperation with theInternational Tropical Timber Organization, which is concerned withpreserving forests and planting new trees.''   In their final statement, the seven summit nations targeted thedepletion of the atmospheric ozone layer, global warming,deforestation, and acid rain.   ``Decisive action is urgently needed to understand and protectthe earth's ecological balance,'' they said, pledging to worktogether to preserve the environment.   ``Environmental considerations must be taken into account ineconomic decision-making,'' said the statement, urging the WorldBank and development banks to ``integrate environmentalconsiderations into their activities.''   The summit nations called for:   _More scientific research on environmental issues and improvedtechnology to reduce pollution.   _Development of substitutes for chloroflurocarbons and jointefforts to limit carbon dioxide emissions.   _Promotion of energy efficiency and tougher safety standards fornuclear power plants.</TEXT></DOC>
