(This isnot a toll-free number.)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2> Reported instances of scientific misconductappear to represent only a small fraction of the total number of researchand research training awards funded by the PHS. Nevertheless, even a smallnumber of instances of scientific misconduct is unacceptable and couldthreaten the continued public confidence in the integrity of the scientificprocess and in the stewardship of Federal funds. The PHS has adopted interimpolicies to provide guidance for dealing with allegations and investigations,based on experience with a number of cases. These interim policies werepublished for the information of the public in the July 18, 1986, issueof the ``NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts'' and became part of the PHSGrants Administration Manual on September 1, 1988. The PHS also recently established two new offices for dealing with scientificmisconduct (see 54 FR 11080, March 16, 1989). The Office of ScientificIntegrity Review (OSIR), established in the Office of the Assistant Secretaryfor Health, is responsible for establishing overall PHS policies and proceduresfor dealing with misconduct in science, overseeing the activities of PHSresearch agencies to ensure that these policies and procedures are implemented,and reviewing all final reports of investigations to assure that any findingsand recommendations are sufficiently documented. The OSIR also makes finalrecommendations to the Assistant Secretary for Health on whether any sanctionsshould be imposed and, if so, what they should be in any case where scientificmisconduct has been established. When necessary, OSIR may conduct independentinvestigations. In addition, the Office of Scientific Integrity (OSI), established in theOffice of the Director, National Institutes of Health (NIH), oversees theimplementation of all PHS policies and procedures related to scientificmisconduct; monitors the individual investigations into alleged or suspectedscientific misconduct conducted by institutions that receive PHS fundsfor biomedical or behavioral research projects or programs; and conductsinvestigations as necessary. The PHS Grants Administration Manual will be revised to accommodate theestablishment of the these offices. The PHS Act directs the Secretary to establish procedures requiring thatentities receiving funds from the PHS for the conduct of biomedical andbehavioral research submit assurances on an annual basis that: (1) These entities have established (based upon regulations prescribedby the Secretary) an administrative process to review reports of scientificmisconduct in biomedical or behavioral research, and (2) they will reportto the Secretary any investigation of alleged scientific misconduct thatappears substantial. The Secretary also has authority to respond to informationreceived with respect to possible scientific misconduct involving projectsunder the PHS Act and to take appropriate action in response to such misconduct.The provisions of section 493 of the PHS Act contemplate that there willbe a close working relationship between the awardee institutions and theDepartment in resolving allegations of scientific misconduct. Section 493envisions that the awardee institutions will have the primary responsibilityfor preventing, detecting, investigating, reporting and resolving allegationsof scientific misconduct. The Department, however, retains the ultimateresponsibility and authority for monitoring such investigations and becominginvolved in those investigations if appropriate or necessary. In order to carry out his formal responsibilities under section 493, theSecretary published a Notice of Proposed Rule making on September 19, 1988(53 FR 36347). That document set forth for public comment proposed responsibilitiesof applicant and awardee institutions, including requirements that theyestablish policies and procedures for investigating and reporting allegationsof scientific misconduct involving research, research training, or relatedactivities for which PHS funds have been awarded or requested. ProposedandSection; 50.104 specified an appropriate time and method for notifyingthe PHS of instances of possible misconduct. Proposed andSection; 103 specifiedthat, if there is a reasonable indication of a criminal violation, theDepartment's Office of Inspector General would be notified within 24 hours.This final rule applies only to institutions applying for or receivingfinancial assistance from the PHS. A separate proposed rule amending 48CFR part 3 will be published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> to cover entities applying for contracts. Institutions are urged to develop, as soon as possible, policies and proceduresfor dealing with and reporting possible misconduct in science within theirinstitution. After the effective date of this Rule, each institution musthave in place an assurance for dealing with scientific misconduct, as outlinedby this rule. Updated information with respect to assurances will be dueeach year, on a date to be specified by OSI. Assurances should be submittedfor approval to the Director, Office of Scientific Integrity, at the above-citedaddress. As stated, this final rule implements section 493 requiring the Departmentto issue regulations concerning investigation and reporting of ``scientificfraud''. (See subsequent text in this preamble regarding use of the terms``fraud'' and ``misconduct'' in this context.) Consequently, the rule doesnot contain specific measures to foster scientific integrity. Other issuesremain to be addressed, including: retention of laboratory data, authorshippractices, the role of grantee institutions and funding agencies in theperformance of audits or studies to prevent the occurrence of scientificmisconduct, and the consistency of such policies across federal agencies.HHS will continue to monitor institutions' responses and propose policiesas may be necessary in the future. Such action may be based in part onthe advance notice of proposed rulemaking published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on September 19, 1988 (53 FR 36344). In addition,consistency of policies in this area across Federal agencies will be monitoredby the Office of Management and Budget in cooperation with the Office ofScience and Technology Policy. <ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Comments </ITAG>As noted, the Secretary published a proposed rule in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on September 19, 1988 (53 FR 36347) for publiccomment. The comment period was open through November 18, 1988. One hundredthirty-nine responses were received that addressed a wide spectrum of issuesconcerning the proposed rule and scientific misconduct in general. Therespondents included 60 institutional representatives, 37 individual staffor faculty members, 20 representatives of professional associations, 16representatives of research institutes or faculty groups, three individualsfrom Federal offices, two private citizens, and one representative of ascientific journal. The responses were generally supportive of the PHS'sefforts and of the proposed rule. Most respondents emphasized that themain responsibility for investigating or preventing cases of scientificmisconduct should remain with the institution. The following is a summary of other main points contained in the commentson the proposed rule, and the Departmental responses. Applicability and Definition of ``Misconduct in Science.'' The proposed rule defined ``misconduct in science'' to mean (1) fabrication,falsification, plagiarism, deception or other practices that seriouslydeviate from those that are commonly accepted within the scientific communityfor proposing, conducting, or reporting research; or (2) material failureto comply with federal requirements that uniquely relate to the conductof research.'' The comments and suggestions received were particularlyhelpful in refining this proposed definition. A number of respondents pointedout that, to the extent the second clause in the definition was largelyintended to deal with violations of human and animal experimentation requirements,these areas are already covered by existing regulations and policies. Othercommenters requested that honest error be excluded from the definition.Still others urged omission of the word ``deception'' inasmuch as deceptioncan be an acceptable component of specific types of research. Some commentersdisagreed with the section of the definition that addressed ``other practicesthat seriously deviate from those that are commonly accepted within thescientific community for proposing, conducting, or reporting research''and proposed that this portion of the definition be deleted. On the otherhand, some commenters suggested expanding the definition to include duplicatepublication and intellectual piracy. Some commenters preferred the term``fraud'' rather than ``misconduct.''<T3>Response. </T3>The definition has been modified considerably in lightof the comments. The term ``deception'' has been deleted. The second clause,referring to material failure to comply with federal requirements thatuniquely relate to the conduct of research, has also been deleted in orderto avoid duplicative reporting of violations of human and animal experimentationrequirements. Further, a sentence has been added to make it clear thatthe definition does not include ``honest error or honest differences ininterpretations or judgments of data.'' At the same time, the language``other practices that seriously deviate'' has been retained to assurecoverage of any serious misconduct that might not technically be considered``fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism.'' With regard to the commentspreferring ``fraud'' over ``misconduct,'' the word ``misconduct'' is cominginto increasing use because it avoids confusion with common law fraud,which contains certain unique characteristics that have no applicabilityto what has commonly come to be known as scientific misconduct. For thisreason, the term ``misconduct'' is being retained. <T3>Assurances. </T3>The notice of proposed rulemaking stated that an institutionapplying for or receiving PHS support must have an assurance satisfactoryto the Secretary regarding procedures for dealing with misconduct in science.Most respondents agreed with the assurance mechanism. This final rule,in andSection; 50.103, specifies that the assurance, on a form prescribedby the    Secretary, must be submitted to the OSI as soon as possible afterNovember 8, 1989, and no later than January 1, 1990, and be updated thereafteron an annual basis. This will enable PHS to ensure that institutions areestablishing procedures that are consistent with the requirements of 42CFR part 50. The assurance will consist of a series of affirmative statements,to be provided on the form prescribed by the Secretary. The OSI will alsoreview annually a sample of institutions, policies and procedures. <T3>Investigations and Reporting. </T3>Most of the respondents agreed withthe overall proposed timing for completion of the inquiry and investigationphases. However, the need for flexibility was stressed in recognition ofthe complex and heterogeneous nature of individual cases. Five respondentssaid the proposed time schedule was too short, and three others suggestedfollowing the National Science Foundation's timetable. The need to requestformally an extension was questioned, and there were two suggestions toinclude ``Inquiries'' in the title of this section. <T3>Response. </T3>After considering all the comments, the PHS believesthe proposed timetable for conducting inquiries and investigations is reasonable.The PHS agrees that a certain degree of flexibility also is appropriatebut disagrees with the contention that institutions should not be requiredto request an extension if the investigation cannot be completed withinthe specified time period. Therefore, the proposed language for this purposein andSection; 50.104(a) is retained. PHS expects that as institutions refine and enhance their policies andprocedures and gain collective experience in conducting investigations,the quality and timeliness of such investigations will improve. Where institutionsfail to carry out their responsibilities as specified in the rule, theDepartment will use whatever remedies may be available under the circumstances.If problems persist, PHS will consider rulemaking to establish additionalsanctions, such as restrictions on or reductions in indirect-cost fundinggoing to an institution, or charges for the costs of investigations thathave to be performed by the OSI. The term ``Inquiries'' has been added to the title of this section, sincethe rule includes a specified time period for this activity. This sectionalso has been expanded to give more specific guidance regarding the scopeof inquiries, investigations, and reports. <T3>Reporting Requirements. </T3>Most of the concerns expressed by respondentswith respect to the reporting requirements were related to the issue ofconfidentiality and to possible damage to the reputations of innocent individuals.They were concerned about the treatment of both the accused and accuser,although eight respondents specifically called for the identification ofthe accuser. Twenty-one respondents were concerned about the due processrights of the accused during an institutional inquiry and/or investigation,as well as the responsibilities of the PHS to protect individuals' privacyand the need to maintain information confidential. Many respondents statedthat a report should be made to the PHS only if substantial evidence isfound, and some respondents stated that only essential information shouldbe reported. <T3>Response. </T3>After considering the comments received regarding thereporting requirements, the PHS has concluded that these requirements shouldbe retained as originally proposed, with the addition that the reportsbe made part of the assurance review process. The PHS understands, andagrees with, the need for the confidential handling of information relevantto investigations. The PHS accepts and pursues anonymous allegations, solong as sufficient information is provided to be able to initiate an inquiry.No information, other than that which ordinarily is available, for exampleunder the Freedom of Information Act, is released by the Department whilean investigation is under way, except to Department personnel on a need-to-knowbasis. The reporting requirements also have been changed to reflect the establishmentof the OSI, which now is the focal point for all of the PHS for dealingwith allegations of scientific misconduct involving research, researchtraining, or related activities supported under the PHS Act. All reportsshall be sent to the OSI, rather than to PHS as was stated in the ProposedRule. The PHS strongly encourages institutions to adopt procedures that willprovide due process to the accused. Section 50.104 sets forth basic dueprocess procedures to be followed during the investigation, such as assuringthat the accused is interviewed and has an opportunity to comment on thefindings of the investigation. The PHS believes the reporting requirements are not unduly burdensome andthat they are necessary in order for the Department to carry out its responsibilityunder the statute for the stewardship of Federal funds. As recipient institutionsgain experience in the conduct of investigations and the preparation ofthe reports of those investigations, the PHS will continue to evaluateits monitoring function. However, at this initial stage of implementation,the PHS believes that an active monitoring role is important and that thereports required under the regulation are essential to that role.<ITAG tagnum="84">Impact Analyses </ITAG>Executive Order 12291 requires that a regulatory impact analysis be preparedfor ``major'' rules which are defined in the Order as any rule that hasan annual effect on the national economy of $100 million or more, or certainother specified effects. The PHS does not believe that this regulation will have an annual economicimpact of $100 million or more or the other effects listed in the Order.For this reason, the PHS has determined that this regulation is not a majorrule within the meaning of the Order. The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)) requires that, for eachrule with a ``significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities,'' an analysis be prepared describing the rule's impact on smallentities and identifying any significant alternatives to the rule thatwould minimize the economic impact on small entities. The Secretary certifies that this regulation will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>This final rule contains information collections that are subject to reviewby the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork ReductionAct of 1980. The title, description, and respondent description of theinformation collection are shown below with an estimate of the annual reportingand record-keeping burden. Included in the estimate is the time for reviewinginstructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintainingthe data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.<T3>Title: </T3>Responsibilities of PHS Awardee and Applicant Institutionsfor Dealing with and Reporting Possible Misconduct in Science. <T3>Description: </T3>As required by the PHS Act, the Secretary shall requirethat applicant and awardee institutions receiving PHS funding investigateand report any allegations of misconduct in science. <T3>Description of Respondents: </T3>Non-profit institutions, small businessesor organizations, for-profit organizations.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,i1,s25,9,8.1,6.1 </C><T4>Estimated Annual Reporting and Record-Keeping Burden  </T4><H1>Applicable section of policy</H1><H1>No. of respondents</H1><H1>Hours per response</H1><H1>Total hours</H1> <T3>Reporting: </T3><ITAG tagnum="2">103(b)(1) <D>2,500 </D><D>7 </D><D>17,500 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">103(b)(2) <D>(2,500) </D><D>3.5 </D><D>8,750 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">103(c)(4)/(d)(4) <D>(20) </D><D>0.2 </D><D>4 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">103(d)(5) <D>(2) </D><D>0.5 </D><D>1 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">103(d)(12) <D>(20) </D><D>0.5 </D><D>10 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">103(d)(15) <D>(20) </D><D>0.5 </D><D>10 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">104(a)(3) <D>(5) </D><D>0.5 </D><D>2.5 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">104(a)(4) <D>(20) </D><D>0.2 </D><D>4 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">104(a)(5) <D>(4) </D><D>1 </D><D>4 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">104(b) <D>(2)</D><D>0.5 </D><D>1</D><R/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Total <D> </D><D> </D><D>17,534</D></ITAG><T3>Record-Keeping: </T3><ITAG tagnum="2">103(d)(1) <D>(40) </D><D>4 </D><D>160 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">(103(d)(6) <D>(40) </D><D>0.5 </D><D>20 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">103(d)(7) <D>(20) </D><D>40 </D><D>800 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">103(d)(10) <D>(20) </D><D>0.2 </D><D>4</D><R/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Total <D> </D><D> </D><D>984</D></ITAG><T3>Disclosure: </T3><ITAG tagnum="2">103(c)(2) <D>2,500 </D><D>1.0 </D><D>2,500 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">103(d)(1) <D>(40) </D><D>0.5 </D><D>20 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">103(d)(7) <D>(20) </D><D>0.5 </D><D>10</D><R/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Total </ITAG><D> </D><D> </D><D>2,530</D><R/><ITAG tagnum="3">Total burden </ITAG><D> </D><D> </D><D>21,048</D></ITAG>As required by section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980,the Department will submit for review by the Office of Management and Budget(OMB) the above-cited information collection requirements.

The organization assumes legaland financial accountability for the awarded funds and for the performanceof the supported activities.``Investigation'' means the formal examination and evaluation of all relevantfacts to determine if misconduct has occurred. ``Misconduct'' or ``Misconduct in Science'' means fabrication, falsification,plagiarism, or other practices that seriously deviate from those that arecommonly accepted within the scientific community for proposing, conducting,or reporting research. It does not include honest error or honest differencesin interpretations or judgments of data. ``OSI'' means the Office of Scientific Integrity, a component of the Officeof the Director of the National Institutes for Health (NIH), which overseesthe implementation of all PHS policies and procedures related to scientificmisconduct; monitors the individual investigations into alleged or suspectedscientific misconduct conducted by institutions that receive PHS fundsfor biomedical or behavioral research projects or programs; and conductsinvestigations as necessary. ``OSIR'' means the Office of Scientific Integrity Review, a component ofthe Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, which is responsiblefor establishing overall PHS policies and procedures for dealing with misconductin science, overseeing the activities of PHS research agencies to ensurethat these policies and procedures are implemented, and reviewing all finalreports of investigations to assure that any findings and recommendationsare sufficiently documented. The OSIR also makes final recommendationsto the Assistant Secretary for Health on whether any sanctions should beimposed and, if so, what they should be in any case where scientific misconducthas been established. ``PHS'' means the Public Health Service, an operating division of the Departmentof Health and Human Services (HHS). References to PHS include organizationalunits within the PHS that have delegated authority to award financial assistanceto support scientific activities, e.g., Bureaus, Institutes, Divisions,Centers or Offices. ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of Health and Human Services and anyother officer or employee of the Department of Health and Human Servicesto whom the authority involved may be delegated. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 50.103</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Assurance_Responsibilities of PHS awardee and applicant institutions.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Assurances.</T3> Each institution that applies for or receives assistanceunder the Act for any project or program which involves the conduct ofbiomedical or behavioral research must have an assurance satisfactory tothe Secretary that the applicant: (1) Has established an administrative process, that meets the requirementsof this Subpart, for reviewing, investigating, and reporting allegationsof misconduct in science in connection with PHS-sponsored biomedical andbehavioral research conducted at the applicant institution or sponsoredby the applicant; and (2) Will comply with its own administrative process and the requirementsof this Subpart.
