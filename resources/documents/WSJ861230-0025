The consumer group's study comes at a time of change in the telephone industry. Next spring, federal Judge Harold Greene is expected to consider granting the seven regional telephone companies wide discretion to enter new businesses.    In addition, the Federal Communications Commission is likely to propose that consumers pay an additional $1 or $2 a month in access charges for connecting telephones to long-distance services.    Gene Kimmelman, legislative director for the Consumer Federation, said the group's study indicates that the phone companies don't need help from the government. &quot;The phone companies are swimming in money,&quot; he said.    Various parties have released differing estimates of phone-rate changes in order to make different -- sometimes contradictory -- political points.    The FCC, which has been promoting telephone deregulation, estimates that interstate long-distance rates have dropped 22% since the Jan. 1, 1984, breakup of American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. The agency has called a news conference for today to announce that ATandamp;T will be required to reduce its rates more than the additional 7% the company already has proposed.    The Consumer Federation, which relies heavily on figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, estimates that interstate long-distance rates have dropped 17% since divestiture. In addition, it estimated that local rates have climbed 40% and intrastate long-distance rates have increased 4%. A typical consumer, the study said, paid about 20% more overall for phone service.    Albert Halprin, chief of the FCC's common carrier bureau, said he hadn't seen the consumer group's study. He said previous studies by the group had focused on flat-rate service for local calls. Mr. Halprin conceded that such rates had risen sharply, but he added that phone companies now offer a variety of local-telephone plans at differing prices.    A spokesman for Nynex Corp. said he hadn't yet seen the report and couldn't comment on its findings. </TEXT></DOC>
