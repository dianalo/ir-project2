The rate will apply during the first six months of this year on$37 billion worth of loans to about 70 countries, said SheldonRappaport, a spokesman for the bank.   For the second half of 1988, the rate was 7.59 percent. Theincrease amounts to only 0.06 percent but will cost the borrowers anadditional $11 million, Rappaport estimated. The rate is based onthe cost of the bank's own borrowings and will be recalculated inmid-1989. The bank gets most of its funds from borrowing on worldmarkets.   The bank is owned by 151 governmwents, with the United Statesholding the largest block of shares, and is the biggest singlesource of aid to Third World countries to help raise their livingstandards. It lends more than $19 billion a year.   When it introduced variable interest rates on most of its loansin July 1982, the annual rate was 11.43 percent. Since then, therate has been reduced each time it was recalculated, twice a year.   The poorest countries, which borrow from the bank's InternationalDevelopment Association, will continue to get loans for 40 years atless than 1 percent a year, with long grace periods during whichonly interest is due.</TEXT></DOC>
