The burden-to-grandchildren talk, of course, was arhetorical weapon against the Reagan tax cuts, whichsupposedly piled up a big national debt that ourgrandchildren would have to tax themselves to redeem. Thegovernment is issuing more debt than ever now that RonaldReagan has retired and George Bush has forsaken hisno-new-taxes pledge, but somehow it's no longer fashionableto worry about grandchildren.</LP><TEXT>   We think the burden on grandchildren does matter, thoughthe deficit is a poor proxy for it. This is one reason we'venever made the deficit the final totem of economic policy,and also one reason it fails to correlate with interest ratesor any other interesting economic variable. If you want toknow what burden we are currently leaving, interest-bearingbonds are only one corner of the picture; you have to look atall future obligations of the U.S. government.   The national debt did not go up an iota, for example, thenight Rep. Fernand St Germain &quot;compromised&quot; between billswith deposit-insurance limits of $40,000 and $50,000 anaccount, and sneaked through a boost to $100,000. Yet bydoubling the government's exposure, this one act imposed afuture obligation of some $100 billion plus interest, or halfthe currently estimated cost of the Savings and Loan Bailout.In 1980, when this took place, the officially measureddeficit was $73 billion.   Not least among the government's future obligations is thecommitment to pay retirement benefits. Back in the 1970s, wewrote a lot about the social-security system's actuarialdeficit, that is the excess of pension commitments overincome to the fund over a 75-year horizon under plausibleeconomic assumptions. This future obligation, recorded inobscure social-security administration reports, was largerthan the entire national debt, the sum of deficits since therepublic was founded. In 1983, for example, the actuarialdeficit of the social-security system was $1.9 trillion,while outstanding Treasury securities totaled $1.4 trillion.   In recent years there have been two attempts to addresssocial-security funding. One by the Carter administration in1977, and the Greenspan Commission during the Reaganadministration in 1983. Both fell back primarily on increasesin the payroll tax. We wrote at the time that the legislationresulting from the Greenspan Commission was no solution,largely because the higher taxes would slow economic growth.But the &quot;fixes&quot; do seem to have increased public confidencein the system, and the new talk of tax cuts seems already tohave reduced it (see chart).   Proponents of the payroll-tax cut are right that areduction would not in fact change much in 2015 or so, whenbig payments will be needed for a retiring baby boom. Thepayroll tax is currently generating more revenues than neededto pay current benefits, and theoretically this surplus isinvested against future years when benefits will exceed thefund's income. But in practice, it's invested in governmentbonds that must be redeemed out of future tax revenues. Sothe choice is whether you tax to pay benefits or tax toredeem bonds. The economic point is that benefits in 2015 canonly be paid out of production in 2015.   The only relevant issue is how much the economy growsbetween now and then. Whether you are talking about thepayroll tax or the income tax or whatever, it's axiomaticthat the tax structure producing the fastest growth todaywill produce the largest economy tomorrow. A cut in thepayroll tax would surely create jobs and boost the GNP,though it would not be the optimum tax cut. Cutting thecapital-gains tax or ending the double taxation of capitalwould do more, especially given the demographic realities. Inthe 1980s, the first task was to create jobs for the babyboom and liberated women. With new labor inputs growingscarce, we now need capital to make each worker moreproductive.   The burden for our grandchildren, though, does not comefrom the payroll tax. It comes from the promises we have madeto future retirees, to ourselves. Currently thesocial-security system promises not merely that retirees in2015 will receive the same benefits as retirees in 1990;later retirees get a bonus reflecting general wage increasesbetween now and then. And since benefits are based on pastpayments to the system, proposals to raise the current cap onthe payroll tax only promise more benefits to our mostprosperous citizens.   We do not write this to oppose a cut in the payroll tax.But somehow we would be much more comfortable about thoseproposals if it were not political anathema to utter thebasic truth. If we were serious about reducing the burden onour grandchildren, the first thing we would do is reduce thegenerous benefits we propose to claim when we retire.</TEXT></DOC>
