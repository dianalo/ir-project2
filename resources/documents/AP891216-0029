Bush's arrival for the Friday night fete was viewed withtrepidation by some city officials who said it and forecast snowwould create gridlock on streets mobbed with holiday shoppers.   Bush got a case of laryngitis and stayed in Washington, but putin an appearance through a long-distance hook-up with the audienceat the Waldorf-Astoria.   He said he wanted the National Association for the Advancementof Colored People to work with his administration in combattingdrugs, improving educational opportunities and helping the homeless.   During his brief telephone remarks, Bush repeatedly apologizedfor not attending the $500-a-person dinner.   ``Even our dog thinks I look sick as a dog,'' he said to laughs.   Bush promised to ``use my office to speak out against racism andbigotry wherever it is found as long as I am president of theUnited States.''   Benjamin Hooks, NAACP executive director, said the president'sabsence should not be misconstrued.   ``He is a man who is trying to lead us to become a gentler,kinder nation,'' Hooks said. ``I want you to know the NCAAP standsready to achieve that goal and purpose.''   Secretary of Health and Human Services Louis Sullivan stepped infor Bush at the last minute and quoted from portions of Bush'sprepared speech, urging the NAACP to join forces with the Bushadministration.   Prominent officials attending the event included David Dinkins,the first black elected mayor of New York, and Virginia Gov.-electL. Douglas Wilder, who last month became the first elected blackgovernor in the nation.</TEXT></DOC>
