But Wednesday's deadly crash separated mother from daughter.   Mrs. Michaelson, a Denver resident, said about an hour fromFlight 232's scheduled arrival in Chicago, the pilot said over theintercom that the tail of the airplane had been damaged and that anemergency landing was necessary.   ``He said we'd have to land and that it would be a rough impact.He advised us to go into a crash position,'' she said.   Sabrina was on her lap, and she held her tightly. Nearby was herhusband, Mark, and their two sons, Doug, 6, and Andy, 4.   ``We're expecting a rough landing. In fact, a very roughlanding,'' the pilot said, according to Michaelson.   Twenty minutes later, the plane crashed while attempting anemergency landing at Sioux Gateway Airport.   Mrs. Michaelson said the airplane flipped when it hit, and shefelt the child sliding to the floor.   Smoke filled the cabin and when their section of the airplanecame to a rest, the couple and their sons fumbled around untilfinding a way out.   As they climbed outside, Michaelson asked, ``Where's the baby?''   Desperate, he went back into the wreckage but encountered thicksmoke and was forced to leave.   Then they saw the child, apparently unharmed, in a woman's arms.   Asked how she had come to have the child, the woman said some manhad handed her over.   ``God, I wish he hadn't,'' said Michaelson. ``I'd like to thankhim personally.''</TEXT></DOC>
