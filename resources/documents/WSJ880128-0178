Sen. Steve Symms (R., Idaho) proposed the repeal of a provision, pushed through last month, that blocked the Federal Communications Commission from reconsidering its rules that forbid companies from owning newspapers and broadcast outlets in the same market, and from extending any existing waivers to the rules.    The defeat underscores the long odds Mr. Murdoch faces in persuading Congress to let him keep the Post. Sen. Symms was soundly defeated in his bid to make his measure an amendment to a separate civil rights bill. Any independent bill affecting the cross-ownership rule would have to pass through the Senate Commerce Committee, headed by Sen. Ernest Hollings (D., S.C.), who staunchly opposes changing the provision.    As reported, a federal appeals court pushed back, probably until some time in April, Mr. Murdoch's deadline to sell either the New York Post or WNYW-TV in New York. Mr. Murdoch has until June 30 to sell either the Boston Herald or WFXT-TV in Boston. </TEXT></DOC>
