Mohammad Nabi Amani, spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, said atleast 139 guerrillas had been killed and 70 wounded since theattack began Sunday. He did not give government casualties.   Guerrillas based in neighboring Pakistan said the they began anew attack Saturday on government posts around Jalalabad, 75 mileseast of Kabul. They claimed to have captured several posts andkilled or wounded 70 soldiers.   Neither claim could be verified. Each side generally exaggeratesthe other's casualties.   Amani said insurgents fired rockets and artillery at the cityand airport, but the armed forces responded quickly.   Jalalabad was the first major guerrilla target after Sovietmilitary forces completed their withdrawal from Afghanistan on Feb.15, ending nine years of involvement in the civil war. When theattack began nearly three months ago, some guerrilla commanderspredicted the city would fall within days.   Capturing Jalalabad, about 45 miles from the border withPakistan, would give the insurgents a base for the interimgovernment they formed in February.   Amani said about 18,000 soldiers had been deployed aroundJalalabad to fight an estimated 22,000 rebels surrounding the city.   Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, who leads the fundamentalist Hezb-e-Islamiguerrilla group, said Monday in Pakistan the war would continueuntil the Marxist government in Kabul falls.   Addressing a news conference in Islamabad, Hekmatyar said hisfollowers would not accept a political solution involving KingZahir Shah, who was overthrown in 1973 and lives in exile in Italy.   In Kabul, Amani said insurgents fired rockets Sunday into Khost,southern Afghanista, killing two civilians. He claimed 30guerrillas were killed and 20 wounded.   He said rockets killed three civilians in Kandahar and gaveguerrilla casualties there as seven killed and five wounded.   Amani reported a civilian wounded in Herat, western Afghanistan,and three insurgents killed in Konduz, a northern province.</TEXT></DOC>
