Inventoryoriented?andM;Natural-language vendors are always quick to point out the pitfalls of visualdata access (either menu- or forms-based): the frustration of accessing dataindirectly and wading through layers of menus.andP;  On the other hand, the folkswho sell visual programming products are quick to slain natural languageprogramming and data access methods.andP;  And they have a point; most naturallanguage products have their limitations and ambiguities.andM;Our main concern is that you are never quite sure whether your query resultis really the answer to your natural language query.andP;  The ways in which theproduct understands your query may not be the way you intend it.andP;  And thenyou get the wrong data.andP;  For example, you may ask  Which salespeople earnedover $80,000?&quot; The answer you get back may be total salary when you onlywanted commissions.andP;  You may even get back a list that spans multiple yearswhen you really only wanted last year's results.andP;  And you wouldn'tnecessarily know whether or not you were looking at invalid data.andM;Handling the Ambiguities.andP;  Natural Language Incorporated (Berkeley,California) has found ways around some of the ambiguities, but some elementsstill need to be worked out.andP;  The flagship product of NLI-appropriatelycalled Natural Language-provides access to several major relational databasemanagement systems (RDBMSs), including Oracle, Sybase, Informix, Ingres, andRdb.andP;  Natural Language doesn't use Boolean statements or keyword mapping forquerying.andP;  It uses linguistic processing instead, with some underlying AI.andO;Natural Language develops an internal representation of your query, performssome deductive reasoning (i.e., thinks about the query in the context of yourtarget application), then generates SQL to query the database.andP;  In otherwords, it understands your query as an English question first, then maps itto the database.andM;Natural Language also has some helpful features for checking the accuracy ofyour query.andP;  To verify that Natural Language has interpreted your querycorrectly, the system includes its rendition of the query along with itsresults.andP;  For instance, if you ask, &quot;Which salespeople made more last yearthan this year?&quot; it might report that its findings were based on the moreaccurate question &quot;Which salespeople made more in fiscal 1987 than in fiscal1988?&quot; Furthermore, Natural Language takes a dialogue approach to querying.andO;You may start out asking, &quot;How many products were shipped to Des Moines in1988?&quot; When you follow that up with &quot;How many were returned?&quot; the systemknows that you're still talking about products shipped to Des Moines.andP;  Thesystem also prompts you when it needs further clarification on a query.andM;But these solutions are not complete.andP;  We still bumped into the ambiguityproblem.andP;  At one point, for instance, we were working with a database thatreached only to 1987.andP;  Just out of curiosity, we asked &quot;Which salespeoplemade more in 1987 than 1988?&quot; The response was &quot;none.&quot; Well, that's simplynot accurate.andP;  Instead, the system should have let us know that it had nodata on 1988.andM;At the Back End.andP;  Natural Language requires preconfiguration at the backend-setting up things like definitions for linguistic processing anddeductive reasoning.andP;  This is best handled by the database administrator.andO;NLI offers a knowledge-based, interactive tool called the NLI Connector,which guides you through the implementation of the relationships and conceptsbehind specific database applications.andP;  In addition, the company markets theNLI Gateway for querying data held in different databases and differentmachines.andM;THE COMPETITION.andP;  NLI is certainly not the only vendor putting out naturallanguage front ends for databases.andP;  A similar product comes from Battelle(Columbus, Ohio), called Natural Language Query, or NLQ.andP;  (You'd think thesecompanies could be a little more resourceful in their product names, wouldn'tyou?) NLQ also lets you query the database in English, and then translatesyour request into SQL to search the database.andP;  And, also like NaturalLanguage, NLQ has a dialogue-driven set-up tool for establishingcommunications protocols, downloading the database structure, and defininguser vocabulary.andP;  NLQ runs on DOS PCs and is available for Oracle, Ingres,Basis/DM, and DB2 databases.andP;  NLQ supports most server configurations,including IBM, Pyramid, Unix, and VAX machines.andP;  However, unlike NLI,Battelle has no tool for querying multiple databases, and you need a separateNLQ version for each database it supports.andM;Although other natural language products abound, such as Intellect from AICorporation, NLI sees most of its competition coming from other means of dataaccess-4GLs and forms- and menu-based systems.andP;  Some interesting graphicalfront ends are popping up.andP;  Ingres, for instance, recently released agraphical front end to its RDBMS.andP;  While there's no natural language involvedin it, the product gives you graphical views of data and a visual queryeditor.andP;  Instead of typing lines of SQL statements, you point and click onthe information you need.andP;  (The product, incidentally, was developed with Sunand is only available for Sun workstations.) Either way, the point is tosimplify database access.andP;  We hope to see more of the same-and perhaps moresophisticated tools as well.andP;  - L. Brown</TEXT></DOC>
