Western issued an additional 7.8 million shares, or 9.02%,of its common stock to ITT under terms of its December 1987agreement to purchase ITT World Communications Inc.</LP><TEXT>   That agreement said that if Western Union's stock fellbelow $2.05625 a share at Dec. 31, 1989, ITT would receivethe difference between $2.05625 and the market value of thestock multiplied by 6,565,350.   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,Western Union closed at 56.25 cents, up 6.25 cents.   The new shares raise ITT's stake in Western Union to16.58% of its 86.8 million shares outstanding and 7.8% ofvoting rights in the beleaguered telecommunications company.That is second to Western's largest shareholder, New Yorkfinancier Bennett S. LeBow, who owns 43.4% of Western'scommon, or 46.4% of its voting rights.   &quot;This is purely pursuant to our 1987 agreement,&quot; said aWestern spokesman. &quot;This is not ITT buying additionalshares.&quot;   Actually, ITT's new status could be short-lived if arecent plan by Western to restructure its debt wins approvalfrom shareholders. Western wants to swap its existing debtsecurities for new notes and to increase its commonoutstanding to 368 million shares. This would shrink ITT'sstake to about 3.9%.</TEXT></DOC>
