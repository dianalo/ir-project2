Grace completed the sale of its restaurant business to a management-led group for $536.7 million. The chemical company said the price was $239 million less than that announced previously because the new owners assumed debt that Grace had held.    ---   Japanese exports fell in November, helping to shrink the country's trade and current-account surpluses. Japanese officials said exports to the Common Market declined because of restrictions imposed to lessen trade tensions with the 12-nation group.    ---   The dollar reached a low for the year against the West German mark in thin trading Friday.
