A toddler swept from his mother's arms was presumed drownedin floodwaters and an Indiana woman apparently was electrocuted.   Much of Arkansas was under a tornado watch early today; themayor in Fargo, N.D., declared a state of emergency after the RedRiver overflowed its banks; and ski resorts in Colorado reveledafter an 18-inch snowfall.   Severe thunderstorms blew through western Tennessee on Monday,demolishing part of an aluminum processing processing plant in Mt.Pleasant. Tornadoes followed the storm and destroyed homes anduprooted buildings, authorities said.   No injuries were reported, said Roy Chaffin, a Mount Pleasantpolice dispatcher.   The storms were accompanied by hail, rain and spectacularlightening. Many areas reported downed trees, signs, roof damageand electrical failures.   At least two tornadoes touched down in southeastern Missouri,ripping roofs off farm buildings and blowing over a mobile home,authorities said.   A tornado was sighted just south of Poplar Bluff, but noinjuries were reported, said Tina Barnett, a Butler Countysheriff's dispatcher.   Tornadoes were spotted throughout Arkansas late Monday, butthere were no reports of injuries or serious damage.   However, the National Weather Service placed most of the state _65 of Arkansas' 75 counties _ under a tornado watch that endedearly today.   In Indiana, officials resumed their search today for a16-month-old boy swept from his mother's arms as she tried to gethim to safety.   The 35-year-old mother told police she had just picked up herchildren from a babysitter and was going home when her car stalledon a gravel road in southern Indiana.   By the time the floodwaters reached the window, she was able toget her 4- and 5-year-old child out of the car, said Capt. RickBarr of the Gibson County Sheriff's Department.   The woman thought she had the toddler in her arms, but he wasswept away, Barr said.   An Evansville woman either drowned or was electrocuted in 5inches of water on the city's northside, police said. An autopsywas scheduled today on Gretchen Brown, 27, who was found by policeat 2:15 a.m.   A utility pole was near her body and Southern Indiana Gas andElectric Co. workers measured 180 volts in a fence nearby.   A tornado Monday at Grayville in southern Illinois toppled treesand utility poles, overturned cars and trucks and tore metal roofsoff of barns. Baseball-sized hail clunked down on the community of2,000 people.   In Fargo, Mayor Jon Lindgren said he was surprised by the speedwith which runoff from melting snow and rain sent the Red Riverover its banks.   ``It did really catch everyone by surprise ... a new twist ofevents,'' he said. ``Of course, we know that's true during thethaw. If the temperature goes outside a standard deviation rangeand you get a little rain on top of it, it just changes instantly.''   Lindgren declared a state of emergency, clearing the way forconstruction of temporary dikes and the leasing of pumps to fendoff flood waters.   Up river, hundreds of volunteers filled sandbags to shore updikes in Breckenridge, Minn., and neighboring Wahpeton, whereflooding caused by ice jams, runoff and rain threatened low-lyingareas.   Ski resort operators in Colorado were happy following a six-daystorm that left up to 5 feet of snow in the mountains. The stormdid cause intermittent road problems and left the avalanche dangerhigh.   The storm brought 18 inches to some areas on Monday, temporarilyclosing Vail Pass.   ``For this time of year, to have this kind of a sustained snow,is very rare,'' said Knox Williams, forecaster with the ColoradoAvalanche Information Center. ``The storms usually hit and get outwithin 24 or 48 hours.</TEXT></DOC>
