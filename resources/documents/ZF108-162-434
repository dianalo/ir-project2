 Stand-alone personalcomputers, workstations and minicomputers are fast becoming anachronisms, andDEC's assertion that &quot;the network is the system&quot; is rapidly proving true.andM;Three significant links in the LAM hardware chain are local repeaters, remotefiber-optic repeaters and LAN concentrators.andP;  During the past years, many ofthese products have become more flexible and powerful, providing multimediaLAN connections and facilitating centralized network management.andP;  (For oursurvey of brdiges and routers, see &quot;Network Bridges and Routers GainVersatility and Sophistication,&quot; DR, Nov. 6, 1989, page 79.)andM;DR defines local and remote repeaters as devices that join two or more LANsinto a larger network.andP;  We view concentrators, by contras, as devices thatserve as the hub of a network.andP;  Repeaters most commonly use thick-wire orthin-wire Ethernet, wheras concentrators tend to employ those media as wellas twisted-pair Ethernet and fiber-optic cabling.andM;In most other functional regards, repeaters and concentrators are almostindistinguishable.andP;  The variables for both devices--the media they employ andthe number of ports they offer--can vary substantially.andP;  Repeater andconcentrator buying decisions hinge less on price or product quality than onthe suitability of each device for a particular network.andM;One warning: The terminology used to describe the devices varies widely fromvendor to vendor.andP;  Products that are labeled differently may, in fact, servethe same purpose.andP;  One vendor's &quot;local repeater&quot; may be another's &quot;activeconcentrator.&quot;andP;  Again, it isn't product classification that really matters:iths whether the number and type of connections each device offers match theneeds of the network's users.andM;Repeaters and concentrators that can be tied in with centralized networkmanagement schemes are a recent and significant LAN hardware development.andM;There is also vendor movement toward centralized networking components.andM;Several vendors have introduced systems that combine various mediatypes--such as unshielded and shielded twisted-pair Ethernet, fiber-opticcable and traditional thin-wire and thick-wire Ethernet--in a single chasis.andO;Even as computing becomes increasingly distributed, the components that makedistribution possible are becoming more centralized.andM;Prices for repeaters and concentrators are generally holding steady.andP;  Butbuyers are getting more features for their money, such as higher numbers ofconnections per unit and integration with almost any media type.andM;Repeaters are no longer just single-media, two-port devices that connect twoLANs.andP;  Many now support a vaiety of transmission media, and some canalternately link local or remote networks.andP;  Basic two-port repeaters, such asthose offered by Garrett Communications, are available from a variety ofvendors, but they aren't the only game in town anymore.andM;Local repeaters connect two or more nearby LAN segments to form a single LAN.andO;Functioning at the physical or lowest layer of the Open Systems Interconnect(OSI) network protocol stack, a repeater retimes and regenerates signals sothey can travel the distance between one LAN segment and one or more otherLAN segments.andM;Choosing an appropriate repeater requires consideration of many factors,including the distance between the LAN segments and the media in use.andP;  Mostrepeaters support both the IEEE 802.3 and Ethernet version 2.0 standards.andO;Some, such as DEC's DECrepeater 200, can automatically detect which standardto follow when installed, but others require manual adjustment.andM;The IEEE 802.3 standard allows cables connecting a local repeater to a LANsegment to stretch as far as 164 feet, with the total distance betweensegments being about 328 feet.andP;  But it is worth noting that some localrepeaters can extend several times that distance.andM;Some local repeaters, such as Cabletron Systems' LR-2000, BICC Data Networks'Isolan 1120 and Raycom Systems' 3560, connect two LAN segments via attachmentunit interface (AUI) cables.andP;  The AUI cable, aslo often called a transceivercable, connects to a transceiver, which provides the interface to the actualLAN segment.andM;Other local repeates, such as Fibermux's FX701-L and Garrett Communications'GCi 1100-1A1B and GCi 1100-2B, utilize other cable combinations, such asthick-wire Ethernet to thin-wire Ethernet.andM;Remote repeaters, by contrast, connect two physically separate LAN segments.andO;The most popular transmission medium for remote repeaters is fiber-opticcable, which can connect LANs that are anywhere from 1,000 feet to 2-1/2miles apart.andP;  Most remote fiber-optic repeaters include a single AUIconnection and a single fiber-optic connection.andP;  The exception is GarrettCommunications' GCi 1100-1B1F, which has a thin-wire Ethernet BNC connectionand a fiber-optic connection.andM;Remote repeaters require the presence of another device at the remote end toreturn the signal to the remote LAN.andP;  The remote device can be anotherrepeater or a more sophisticated device, such as a bridge.andP;  Repeaters withmore than two ports can often be used as both local and remote devices,although not simultaneously.andP;  Such models include Cabletron's FR-3000 andDEC's DECrepeater 200.andM;Repeaters offering more than two communications ports are often calledmultiport repeaters.andP;  Multiport repeaters may join eight or more LANsegments, providing a relatively inexpensive means of building a LAN withmore nodes than a single segment permits.andP;  Similarly, when the individualboards in a concentrator serve repeater functions and include more than twoports, some vendors call the device a multiport repeater.andM;Multiport repeaters follow the Ethernet/IEEE 802.3 networking standard, whichspecifies a bus topology.andP;  According to this topology, all network nodesconnect to a linear segment, or bus, and communicate with each other via thatbus.andP;  One disadvantage of this arrangement is that the bus structure and theoriginal Ethernet media of thick and thin coaxial cable preclude centralizednetwork management.andM;A concentrator, by contrast, is most frequently used as the center of astar-shaped LAN.andP;  Each arm of the star is a LAN segment--frequentlytwisted-pair or fiber-optic cabling--that connects to personal computers,workstations and the like.andP;  Star topology simulates the bus topoloty requiredby the Ethernet and 802.3 standards.andP;  Most star implementations are actuallymore like a snowflake topology, allowing stars to connect with other stars aswell as with a hierarchically organized network.andM;Star topologies allow networks to be managed from a central location,facilitating what Brad Bladwin, an industry analyst with the San Jose Calif.,andO;market research company Dataquest, calls &quot;distributed structured wiring.&quot;andO;Because they allow network components to be located in a single wiringcloset, concentrators can be used to connect and manage thousands of networkscentrally.andM;All but one of the DEC-compatible LAN concentrators are active devices.andP;  Theonly passive concentrator, Codenoll Technology's Codestar Optical StarCoupler Series, functions much like a repeater, except it doesn't retime andthen regenerate signals; instead, it retransmits signals exactly the way theycome in.andM;It's now technically feasible for workstations and high-end personalcomputers to serve as centralized management stations that monitor andcontrol network components, including repeaters and concentrators.andP;  Manyvendors have therefore introduced repeaters and concentrators that can betied in with various network management schemes.andM;Dataquest's Baldwin said the first wave of network management activity--justending now--involves vendors developing proprietary management schemes.andP;  Anumber of vendors, including BICC Data Networks, Cabletron Systems, DavidSystems, Infotron Systems, Synoptics Communications and Ungermann-Bass, offerdevices that include proprietary network management features.andM;A MATTER OF STANDARDSandM;The next wave, Baldwin said, will see vendors developing schemes based onexisting or proposed network management standards, to allow their products tooperate in conjunction with other vendors' devices.andP;  BICC, Cabletron, RaycomSytems and Synoptics have already expressed support for, or have introducedproducts that support, SunNet, the network management system for multivendorenvironments from Sun Microsystems of Mountain View, Calif.andM;At issue is whose network management protocol will become the industrystandard.andP;  Currently, the most popular management protocol is SNMP, theSimple Network Management Protocol.andP;  SNMP is the offspring of Internet, agroup of interconnected networks serving the U.S.andP;  academic researchcommunity.andP;  Closely tied to TCP/IP, SNMP has been sanctioned by the Internetactivities board, which approves protocols for Internet implementation.andM;But the network management future may belong to a newcomer called CMIP, theCommon Management Information Protocol.andP;  Currently only a rough draft, CMIPis part of the OSI protocol suite, and it isn't expected to be approved bythe International Standards Organization committee until next year.andM;Although some LAN devices already use CMIP--and DEC has announced that itsEnterprise Management Architecture will utilize the protocol--it's entirelypossible that CMIP will change before it becomes an actual standard.andM;Even though many repeaters and concentrators don't provide any centralizednetwork management, most provide some degree of fault isolation capability.andO;Many support partitioning, for example, allowing the detection and isolationof faulty LAN segments.andP;  Such segments prevent end nodes on the segment fromcommunicating, and could even bring all network traffic to a halt.andO;Partitioning is usually automatic, but some products let network managerspartition segments manually.andM;Modular design is another new and important repeater and concentrator trend.andO;Many products now consist of a chassis, a power supply and a number of slotsthat can be used to connect various internetworking devices.andP;  Centralizingcomponents on a single chassis can simplify wiring as well as networkexpansion.andM;Cabletron's MMAC-8, for instance, includes a chassis, a power supply andeight slots that can accommodate &quot;media interface modules.&quot;andP;  A singlerequired module in the MMAC provides all of the actual repeater functions,and each of the optional media interface modules provides connections forvarious types of media.andM;Other modular offerings include Lannet Data Communications' LET-18, Sincor'sLAN One Universal Concentrator, Synoptics' various concentrators andUngermann-Bass' Access/One Series.andP;  Many of the modularization schemes allownetwork components to be &quot;hot-swapped&quot;--that is, removed and replaced withoutdisturbing the function of other components in the same chassis.andM;Modularization has spawned some interesting merging of network componentswithin a single chassis.andP;  The main function of Xyplex's MAXserver LANbus isas a terminal server, not as a repeater.andP;  But its modular design allows morethan one LAN interconnect card--which it uses to communicate with the rest ofthe network--to be installed, effectively making the MAXserver a repeater ifit's connected to two LAN segments.andM;There is at least one repeater twist on the horizon.andP;  According to BobAnderson, an applications engineer with Cabletron Systems, recent agreementsbetween LAN vendors and chip manufacturers may soon yield a&quot;repeater-on-a-chip.&quot;andP;  Such a device would require fewer repeater componentsand thus would be cheaper to manufacture than current repeater offerings.andM;The decreasing cost of network bridges has made basic two-port repeaters lessattractive by comparison.andP;  But the future looks bright for repeaters andconcentrators that link more than two segments, or provide the foundation ofa star-shaped network.andP;  Such devides are expected to dominate repeater andconcentrator sales soon.andP;  Now that these devices are being included innetwork management schemes, their power--and attractiveness--should continueto increase.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
