The new creditors' committee includes representatives of theMachinists union and pilots union at Miami-based Eastern.   The Machinists struck the airline on March 4 after 17 months ofwrangling with management over a contract. The pilots' support forthe walkout virtually grounded Eastern and forced it to file forprotection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcylaws on March 9.   The Eastern pilots are owed more than $500 million in back payand other claims, said Ron Cole, a spokesman in Miami for the AirLine Pilots Association.   A federal appeals court in New York, meanwhile, refused to letcommuter railroad workers cripple Northeast rail transit by honoringthe picket lines of striking Eastern Machinists.   The unionized rail workers wanted the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court ofAppeals to allow them to strike in sympathy with Eastern workers.But the appeals court refused to lift a lower court's bar on suchstrikes.   In Houston, officials of Eastern's sister carrier ContinentalAirlines preparing for heavy Easter travel dismissed the effects ofa flight attendants' strike. They said the walkout is not disturbingservice despite union claims of delays and cancellations.   The creditors' panel also includes a representative of non-unionemployees of Eastern, most of whom were laid off shortly after thestrike began and are demanding back pay.   The creditors' committee has the right to review anyreorganization plan proposed by Eastern and can propose its own planto the bankruptcy judge.   U.S. Trustee Harold Jones told a gathering of around 400 creditorrepresentatives, financial analysts and reporters that the role ofthe creditors' panel is ``far more expansive'' than his.   Eastern says it has $5.9 billion in assets and $4.5 billion inliabilities. Unsecured creditors, such as ticketholders and travelagents, are the most likely to lose money in a bankruptcyreorganization, because they have no collateral, or security, fromthe debtor in case of default.   The airline's secured creditors, mainly bondholders, met withEastern President Phil Bakes on Tuesday.   Eastern's liabilities include $1.69 billion in long-term debt,$736 million in capital lease obligations and $165 million in unusedtickets issued to passengers, Harvey Miller, one of Eastern'sbankruptcy attorneys, told the creditors' meeting.   ``The objective of Chapter 11 is to rebuild Eastern,'' saidMiller, a partner in Weil, Gotschal Manges. ``It is Eastern's planto resuscitate the airline and build back its flight schedule.''   The embattled airline recently started advertising for new pilotsin newspapers. Only about 200 of the 3,600 or so pilots at Easternhave crossed Machinist picket lines to fly. Eastern is operatingonly a fraction of the flights in its normal schedule, except fornearly normal service on its Northeast air shuttle and to LatinAmerica.   Miller said 167 planes out of Eastern's fleet of 254 aircraft arecurrently inactive, parked on airport runways in Miami, Atlanta,Orlando, Fla., and New York (Kennedy International Airport).   In addition to the International Association of Machinists andthe Air Line Pilots Association, the other members of the unsecuredcreditors' committee are as follows. Where available, the amountowed them by Eastern is included:   Aircraft manufacturer Airbus Industrie, $95.94 million; GeneralElectric Co., $75.47 million; Citicorp; United States Trust Co. ofNew York, $58.74 million; Boeing Co., $53.98 million; UnitedTechnologies Credit Corp., $22.30 million; IBJ Schroder Bank andTrust Co., $19.56 million; American National Bank andamp; Trust Co.,$12.76 million; Rolls-Royce Credit Corp., $5.89 million; MarriottCorp., $1.05 million; ATandamp;T Communications, $800,876; Rohr AeroServices; and Mary Shore, representing non-union employees ofEastern.   Shore is an elected representative of a non-union group calledPEACE, or Positive Employee Action Committee at Eastern, which unionofficials allege is sponsored by Eastern management.   The Transport Workers Union, which represents flight attendantsat Eastern, was not included on the committee.   TWU officials were unavailable for comment on their union'sexclusion, but a representative of the union attending thecreditors' meeting was visibly annoyed and voiced his objection toJones.   All three unions at Eastern had requested that they berepresented on the creditors' committee, and the airline itself hadendorsed the idea on Tuesday.</TEXT></DOC>
