The Business Week scandal also has focused attention onwidespread ignorance of what insider trading is, despite the waveof publicity about Wall Street felons such as Ivan Boesky.   In addition, the scandal illustrates the securities industry'sown problems in detecting and policing suspicious trades, despiteits array of sophisticated surveillance gear.   Although Business Week has been faulted by some for notdisclosing longtime suspicions of insider trading on themarket-sensitive ``Inside Wall Street'' columns, lawyers agree thebiggest U.S. business weekly bears no legal liability for whathappened and took sincere action to stop the thefts.   But the magazine's policy of reporting on little-known, thinlytraded stocks, a key element of the scandal, has aroused concernthat Business Week may have been an unwitting accomplice of theinsider traders.   ``It does make the situation more troubling,'' said Sam ScottMiller, a securities lawyer in New York. ``But it's always easy tojudge what the right thing to do was after it's clear what wasgoing on.''   John Dierdorff, Business Week's managing editor, said in aninterview that the magazine is acutely aware of the potentialimpact on prices of offbeat stocks described in ``Inside WallStreet,'' but has to balance that concern against the news value oftelling readers about interesting situations.   ``We do not tip stocks,'' Dierdorff said. ``If you actually makerecommendations, you'd have to get yourself a license from one ofthe regulatory bodies.''   The magazine's aim in the column, Dierdorff said, has been andwill be ``to report what some smart guys on Wall Street are doing.''   Trades in at least two dozen securities firms are underinvestigation because of the scandal, in which some employees ofR.R. Donnelley andamp; Sons Co., a company that prints Business Week,peddled issues to brokers before the magazine reached the public.   The brokers then bought stocks described in ``Inside WallStreet,'' and sold them later for profit, after other investors hadread the column and purchased the stocks, thereby inflating theprices.   At least seven people have lost their jobs because of allegedroles in the scandal. Although no charges had been filed by theweekend, the Securities and Exchange Commission and criminal-lawenforcers in at least two states were known to be involved inprobes of the purloined magazines.   The use of confidential information to buy and sell stocks iscommonly described as insider trading and is considered a felonyunder federal securities laws.   Two weeks after Business Week revealed the problem, whicheditors had suspected in early 1987, the magazine gave the firstdetailed accounting of what happened.   In the latest issue, distributed Friday, Business Week said itfirst tried to plug suspected leaks by tightening securityprocedures, restricting access to ``Inside Wall Street'' during theediting process, and reminding printers of the need forconfidentiality. The problem appeared to abate until this spring.   Editor-In-Chief Stephen Shepard defended the magazine's decisionnot to alert the SEC, saying regulators may have demandeddisclosure of confidential news sources as part of anyinvestigation.   Moreover, Business Week had no obligation to notify thecommission, in the opinion of its general counsel, Robert N.Landes. Other lawyers agreed with that opinion, especially sincethe magazine had determined none of its staff was implicated.   ``When you go talk to the cops, the first thing the cops do ischase the people who reported the incident,'' said Stephen R.Miller, a securities lawyer at the Philadelphia law firm of DechertPrice andamp; Rhoads. ``So you're a little wary and want to be sure youknow the guy who did it.''   As in many insider trading cases, the key to finding theculprits is abnormal trading of the stocks in question. But eventhe most sophisticated technology used to track stock activity doesnot reveal more than simple hints.   Market surveillance computers at the major exchanges aredesigned to sound alarms when a stock breaks its historical priceor volume pattern, an aberration called a ``kickout.''   In the Business Week case, more than two dozen stocks kicked outover a period of many months and were noticed by surveillanceofficials at the New York Stock Exchange, American Stock Exchangeand National Association of Securities Dealers, which monitorsover-the-counter trading.   But these officials said in interviews that patterns of tradingcan be extremely difficult to detect, especially if the stocks haveno apparent relationship or the kickouts occur irregularly.   ``When you see 10 different stocks kicking out at any point intime, it's not necessarily going to click immediately,'' said AgnesGautier, vice president of market surveillance at the NYSE. ``Whatyou're looking for is a common theme.''   Even if kickouts are traceable to a column in Business Week orsome other publication, she said, ``Of necessity, you're talkingabout time and a number of issues. You have to see that before yousay there's a problem here.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Sunday Aug. 7</NOTE></DOC>
