(FDC)FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD (FED)</GV><RE>NORTH AMERICA (NME)UNITED STATES (US)</RE><LP>   WASHINGTON -- When regulators closed Southeast Bank lastweek, they cut a small hole in the federal safety net forbanks. The change is designed to prod troubled banks to seekhelp more quickly and to slow the drain on the FederalDeposit Insurance Corp. by reducing the cost of future bankcollapses.   Typically, regulators close a sick bank when its capitalruns out. By this measure Southeast was clearly solvent: The$10.3 billion Miami bank still had $409 million of equitycapital, plus $430 million of loan-loss reserves. Butregulators used a different standard -- liquidity -- todeclare the bank insolvent.</LP><TEXT>   Fearing that Southeast was on the verge of collapsebecause of large losses on real-estate loans, depositorswithdrew more than $1 billion in July and August. Southeastborrowed heavily from the Federal Reserve to meet liquidityneeds. Last week regulators decided the bank couldn't pullitself out of the tailspin. The Fed called $568 million indiscount-window loans, and the bank was closed because itcouldn't pay.                                                                                                          The focus on liquidity means banks will have less time towork out problems. This should change attitudes in bank boardrooms. &quot;If you're not worried about liquidity, you say we canskate through,&quot; says Harrison Young, the FDIC's director ofresolutions. &quot;If you're worried about liquidity, you see thedownside risk&quot; of a deposit run that could trigger a rapidclosure. That risk is now higher because the Fed facespressure from the House Banking Committee to limit extensionsof emergency credit to critically ill banks.                                                                                                          In this environment, &quot;there's going to be less temptationto play out the string,&quot; says William Isaacs, a former FDICchairman who heads the Secura Group, a bank consulting firm.&quot;Hopefully, this will cause people to enter into a mergerwith another bank, to raise more capital or to seekassistance from the FDIC.&quot;   Banks that act soon enough to prevent failure won't becomea drain on the FDIC. Prompt action to close a bank headed forfailure sharply reduces the FDIC's resolution costs bystemming the erosion of the bank's value. The closure ofSoutheast before it had exhausted capital and loss reserveswas one of the reasons the FDIC was able to sell the bank toFirst Union Corp. under a new arrangement that requires theCharlotte, N.C., company to bear 15% of the losses fromSoutheast's nonperforming loans. Normally the FDIC bears theentire cost, boosting the cost to the agency.   The Southeast transaction is the clearest sign yet thatregulators are responding to congressional demands to dealmore quickly with sick banks. Financial supervision failed inthe 1980s because regulators let problems fester. Nowtaxpayers are paying $200 billion to protect depositors infailed savings and loans, and the bank deposit insurance fundis nearly bankrupt, drained by nearly 1,000 bank failuressince 1986.   A House Banking Committee study found that regulators keptcritically ill banks open an average of 10 to 12 monthsbefore failure, often with emergency loans from the Fed; 90%of the banks that received extended credit failed, increasingcosts to the FDIC.   Legislation making its way through Congress requiresregulators to impose corrective measures as soon as problemssurface in a bank and forces regulators to close banks beforethey become insolvent.   &quot;We're in a new world of case resolutions beforeinsolvency,&quot; says Robert Dugger, chief economist at theAmerican Bankers Association. He applauds the approach as away to slow demands on the Bank Insurance Fund, financed bypremiums banks pay. But he notes that closing a bank beforeit's insolvent wipes out stockholder equity in the bank,reducing the cost to the FDIC at the expense of theshareholder. &quot;This might send a message to shareholders thatthey ought to make sure that their bank is safer than safe,&quot;perhaps to the point of the bank restricting credit to limitloan risks, he fears.                                                                                                          For its part, the FDIC is looking for ways to keep banksfrom failing in the first place. FDIC Chairman L. WilliamSeidman is urging Congress to allow commercial and industrialcompanies to purchase failing banks as a way to rescue themwith new capital. But the idea of combining commerce andbanking faces strong opposition.                                                                                                          In addition, the agency is devising methods to combineprivate investment and FDIC aid to prop up tottering banksbefore they face insolvency or a liquidity crisis. The changein the safety net for banks should induce officers to dealwith problems before they become critical. &quot;The best way tosave money is not to have to close the bank,&quot; Mr. Young says.</TEXT></DOC>
