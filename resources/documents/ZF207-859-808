 Many CD-ROMs are adaptions ofdata collections assembled on mainframes with minimal formattingand contain strictly ASCII code; publishers attempting to fillmegabytes simply use vast amounts of text rather than implementinggraphical data.andP;  The disks also follow the mainframe convention ofnot dividing documents into lines or paragraphs.andP;  Simple,efficient ways of upgrading existing data to a 'normal' level offormatting are needed; this process requires informationtransformation specialists who can draw upon skills in graphics,database design, information retrieval, and programming to makedata attractive.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     CD-ROMData basesData PreparationTechnology Transfer.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>&quot;PC format&quot; for a CD-ROM doesn't necessarily mean a design based on IBM-stylepersonal computers -- these days it may harken back instead to a format basedon punched cards.andP;  If you look at what's actually available on deliverableCD-ROMs, you will see that many of the discs look like rows of mainframeprintouts shrunken into light-weight plastic saucers.andM;It may be disappointing to users that many CD-ROM offerings reflect little ornothing of the revolution in graphical data presentation popularized by theMacintosh.andP;  But it also represents an opportunity for a new breed of dataspecialists.andM;Filling megabytes.andP;  One reason for the current data drabness is that manydiscs are adaptations of existing computerized data collections.andP;  Thosecollections were designed in the days when mainframe databases used a minimumof formatting for their data.andP;  It's hard to fill 600 Mbytes with usefultextual information unless you start with a computerized database, so whatgoes for mainframe data goes for most initial CD-ROM discs.andM;On the Mac, we're used to text with attributes such as size, weight andstyle, but none of these factors are part of the basic ASCII coding used formainframe data.andP;  Even the character graphics you see on low-resolution,IBM-style PCs are relatively recent, requiring codes reserved for other useson mainframe terminals and printers.andM;Document divisions.andP;  This kind of graphical parsimony also extends totext-grouping and page layout on mainframes.andP;  Many large mainframecollections have no useful divisions between the document and the line orparagraph.andP;  Only recently, with prodding by the Department of Defense, hasthe information industry begun to adopt standards for text-coding andstructuring -- the clunky SGML (structured generalized markup language) beingthe chosen solution.andM;You can see the effects in discs derived from publicly available governmentdatabases, such as the series produced by Wayzata Technology of Farmington,Minn.andP;  Wayzata's World Factbook disc, for example, is basically the text ofthe CIA's paperback World Factbook.andP;  There's a lot of data there, but it'shard to fend off the MEGO (my eyes glaze over) syndrome when faced with 146Mbytes of text without a font change or underline.andM;Graphic presentation of text isn't much better on the IBM side, where the fewmultimedia-oriented titles also are outnumbered by regimented columns ofmono-spaced characters.andP;  I've seen a number of discs that I could callstriking, but none yet that are understatedly elegant.andM;Exquisite but automatic.andP;  What's needed, apparently, are easy and efficientways to upgrade existing graphically deficient data to the level offormatting we now think of as normal.andP;  Given the small total volume of theCD-ROM market, that method can't require a lot of expensive tweaking andtuning by hand.andM;It's a lot like the early days of stereo phonograph records, when manylow-cost record labels took their surfeit of monaural recordings and&quot;electronically reprocessed&quot; them into stereo.andP;  Once the process was set up,a moderately skilled engineer with a good ear could turn out a lot ofreformatted material.andM;Doing the equivalent for large data collections won't take audio engineers,but a new breed of information transformation specialists.andP;  We need morepeople who can draw upon skills in graphics, information retrieval, databasedesign, programming and possibly artificial intelligence to take existingdull data and turn it into attractive information.andM;The skill set needed is related to what's required for good HyperCard stackdesign, but there are differences.andP;  You don't get many HyperCard text stacksin the hundreds of megabytes yet, and HyperCard users need not worry aboutmainframe data access methods and the arcane points of American Na-tionalStandards Institute (ANSI) tape labels.andP;  Those who succeed in this kind ofdata extraction will have to know more about databases.andM;When there's only one source for needed information, design may not count formuch.andP;  But as the number of companies publishing CDs goes up and the list oftitles expands, CDs that are attractive and interesting will have an edgeover those that are monotonous.andP;  What we need, I believe, are more keyboardvirtuosos who can make even dull data sing.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
