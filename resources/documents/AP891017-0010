According to diplomats in Addis Ababa, the rebels have pushedgovernment forces back and reached nearly to Dese, 155 miles fromthe capital.   The reports could not be confirmed. But a rebel advance to Desewould raise a threat of cutting the road between Addis Ababa andthe Red Sea port of Assab, site of Ethiopia's only oil refinery andone of two key points of entry for tons of emergency relief food.   One African diplomat said President Mengistu Haile Mariam'sforces would have act to halt the rebel advance before it becomesserious trouble for the government.   The diplomats interviewed spoke on condition they not beidentified.   The push southward is by a group calling itself the EthiopianPeoples' Revolutionary Democratic Movement, a combined force of theTigre People's Liberation Front and the Ethiopian People'sDemocratic Movement.   The Liberation Front, which took up arms in 1974, is pressingfor increased autonomy for the province of Tigre and the overthrowof Mengistu's Marxist government. The Front has an estimated 20,000troops.   The Democratic Movement, a smaller group, split four years agofrom the radical Ethiopian Peoples' Revolutionary Party formedafter the 1974 ouster of the late Emperor Haile Selassie.   The Ethiopian army went through a leadership crisis following aMay 15 coup attempt, when troops loyal to Mengistu killed at least14 generals and the government jailed 100 senior officers.   Officers appointed to replace those killed or imprisoned havelittle field experience and apparently have failed to rally thesupport of the troops, one African envoy said.   In a speech after the coup, Mengistu said the rebelliousgenerals had lacked patriotism. He blamed them for the government'srepeated recent failures in clashes with the rebels.   He was referring to rebel victories that began with a jointoffensive in May 1988 by the Liberation Front and the secessionistEritrean Peoples' Liberation Front when the rebels captured most ofTigre and much of Eritrea, Ethiopia's northernmost province.   The Eritreans have been fighting since 1962, but in Septemberbegan peace talks with the government. The second round of talks isscheduled for Nov. 18 in Kenya's capital, Nairobi.   The government recouped most of its losses in Tigre, but thelines in Eritrea remained static. Another Liberation Frontoffensive from February to March pushed government forces out ofnearly all of Tigre, setting the stage for the recent offensive.   The reports said a string of rebel victories pushed 20,000government troops and thousands of civil servants from the Tigreanprovincial capital of Mekele south to Maychew, near Tigre'ssouthern border and out of the province and into neighboring Wollolast month.   Diplomats said the army suffered a major defeat in Maychew,where they said the rebels destroyed at least 15 Soviet-made tanksand captured more than 20. The rebels also seized an unknown numberof anti-aircraft guns, multiple rocket launchers, and ammunition,they said.   ``Two divisions were wiped out,'' said one Western diplomat.   The Liberation Front, in a clandestine broadcast Sept. 20, saidthe rebels killed or wounded 17,000 government troops and captured10,300. It was impossible to verify the claim.   The Ethiopian government has an estimated 313,000 troops but themorale of the soldiers is questionable.   In addition to low troop morale, Mengistu also faces the problemof financing the war, which he said consumed half of theimpoverished nation's budget this year.   The World Bank calculates Ethiopia's per capita income at $120 ayear and considers the Horn of Africa nation of 49 million peoplethe world's poorest.   Diplomats say the Soviet Union, Ethiopia's major arms supplier,is pressing Mengistu to seek a political solution to the fighting.   Addis Ababa residents say they are skeptical a negotiated end tothe war is possible in Tigre and Wollo and believe the rebels willnot stop until the current government is overthrown.</TEXT></DOC>
