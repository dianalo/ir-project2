Unit To Sell Line; Gain Set </HL><SO> </SO><CO> ASH </CO><IN> TNM </IN><DATELINE> ASHLAND, Ky.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Ashland Oil Inc. said its Ashland Chemical Co. unit will sell its carbon black business to Degussa, a West German chemical company, for about $60 million.    The sale will result in an after-tax gain of about $18 million, or 33 cents a share, in Ashland's fiscal first quarter. In the year-earlier quarter ended Dec. 31, the company earned $71.1 million, or $2.50 a share, on revenue of $1.93 billion. Ashland is a diversified energy company, with operations in petroleum refining, chemicals, oil and gas production, and coal.    The sale includes Ashland Chemical's three carbon black manufacturing plants, which make carbon reinforcement material for tires and industrial rubber products, and a technical services laboratory.    Ashland said the sale fits its plan to emphasize the chemical and plastic distribution and specialty chemicals businesses. It also said, &quot;The recent globalization of tire manufacturing, the largest market for carbon black, has made it increasingly difficult&quot; to meet customer needs. </TEXT></DOC>
