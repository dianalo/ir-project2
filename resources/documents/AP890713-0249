(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The union representing Northwest Airlinespilots says it will ask a federal mediator to call an impasse intalks with the airline, paving the way for a possible strike, ifsubstantial progress in talks isn't made by Friday.   ``Twenty-eight months in negotiations is probably long enough toconclude a contract,'' pilot spokesman Curt Kruse of the5,000-member Air Line Pilots Association said Wednesday.   ``We are getting the feeling that management is stringing usalong and trying to make this last as long as possible,'' Kruse said.   But Northwest spokesman Bob Gibbons denied the allegation.   ``The goal is to get a contract, not string anybody along,''Gibbons said. ``As along as both sides are talking we can movetoward an agreement.''   The union's harsh talk came after the pilots and Northwestnegotiators met Wednesday for the second time this week. Northwestand the union have tentatively settled hundreds of issues in the thepast two months but are still at odds over the hard issues _ wages,job security, work rules and insurance.   Former Republic Airlines pilots and original Northwest pilots arestill working under separate agreements even though the two airlinescombined operations nearly three years ago.   ``The result is that our membership becomes increasinglyfrustrated,'' Kruse said. ``They want a showdown with management.''   Under federal labor law, only the National Mediation Board candeclare an impasse in airline negotiations. If the board declares animpasse, a 30-day cooling-off period begins. After the end of thecooling-off period, the union is free to strike and the company canimplement its final offer.   Kruse said if substantial movement doesn't occur in thenegotiations, the union strike committee will ask the union's masterexecutive councils to obtain airport permits for informationalpicketing.</TEXT></DOC>
