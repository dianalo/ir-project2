The talks were opened Monday by Foreign Minister RussellMarshall.   Environmentalists, such as the Greenpeace organization, arestrongly opposed to any mining in Antarctica and say themineral-rich continent could one day ignite a military conflict asthe world's natural resources dwindle.   Greenpeace, which conducts scientitic research in Antarctica, iscampaigning to have the continent a ``world park.''   But to others, in particular the 19 countries operatinggeological programs there, Antarctica is rich in mineral resourceswaiting to be extracted.   The United States, which is represented at the meeting,estimates there are 48 billion barrels of offshore petroleumreserves and vast quantities of coal, copper, gold and uranium inAntarctica.   Marshall told representatives from the 37 Antarctic Treatynations there was no reference to mining in a 1959 Antarctic Treatyand the meeting would fill that gap. In 1977, the nations agreed tovoluntary mineral restraints.   Chris Beeby, deputy secretary of foreign affairs, said it hadnot been determined whether mining should ever be allowedAntarctica.</TEXT></DOC>
