Theseregulations were challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuitby the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund, Inc., the Natural Resources DefenseCouncil, Inc., and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in <T3>Sierra Club</T3> v. <T3>EPA,</T3> 719 F. 2d 436. On October 11, 1983, the court issued itsdecision, ordering EPA to reconsider portions of the stack height regulations,reversing certain portions, and upholding other portions.On February 28, 1984, the electric power industry filed a petition fora writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court. On July 2, 1984, theSupreme Court denied the petition (104 s. CT. 3571), and on July 18, 1984,the Court of Appeals formally issued a mandate implementing its decisionand requiring EPA to promulgate revisions to the stack height regulationswithin six months. The promulgation deadline was ultimately extended toJune 27, 1985.Revisions to the stack height regulations were proposed on November 9,1984 (49 FR 44878), and finalized on July 8, 1985 (50 FR 27892). The revisionsredefine a number of specific terms, including ``excessive concentration,''``dispersion techniques,'' ``nearby,'' and other important concepts, andmodify some of the bases for determining good engineering practice (GEP)stack height.Pursuant to section 406(d)(2) of Pub. L. 95-95, all states were requiredto (1) review and revise, as necessary, their state implementation plans(SIPs) to include provisions that limit stack height credit and dispersiontechniques in accordance with the revised regulations and (2) review allexisting emission limitations to determine whether any of these limitationshave been affected by stack height credit above GEP or any other dispersiontechniques. For any limitations so affected, states were to prepare revisedlimitations consistent with their revised SIPs. All SIP revisions and revisedemission limits were to be submitted to EPA within 9 months of promulgation,as required by statute.Subsequently, EPA issued detailed guidance on carrying out the necessaryreviews. For the review of emission limitations, states were to prepareinventories of stacks greater than 65 m in height and sources with emissionsof sulfur dioxide (SO<T2>2</T2>) in excess of 5,000 tons per year. These limits correspond tothe <T3>de minimis</T3> GEP stack height and the <T3>de minimis</T3> SO<T2>2</T2> emission exemption from prohibited dispersion techniques. Sourceswere exempted from further review if they fell under the grandfatheringclause (i.e., in existence before December 31, 1970), if their stack heightwas less than <T3>de minimis</T3> stack height (65 m), or if their actual height wasless than the calculated Good Engineering Practice (GEP) stack height.The remaining sources were then subjected to detailed review for conformancewith the revised regulations. State submissions were to contain an evaluationof each stack and source in the inventory. South Carolina has indicatedthat the documentation is available for review at the State Office (listedabove).On May 7, and December 2, 1986, South Carolina submitted for EPA's approvaldocumentation for Good Engineering Practice (GEP) Stack Height. EPA proposedto approve the declaration on January 18, 1989 (54 FR 1953). At that time,the public was invited to submit written comments on the proposed action.However, no comments were received. EPA is therefore approving the State'sdeclaration that no emission limitations were affected by stack heightcredit above GEP or any other dispersion technique, except as the declarationapplies to three sources identified below.On January 22, 1988, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbiaissued its decision in <T3>NRDC </T3>v. <T3>Thomas</T3>, 838 F.2d 1224 (D.C. Dir. 1988), regarding the EnvironmentalProtection Agency's (EPA's) stack height regulations (50 FR 27892, July8, 1985); the court upheld most of the rules, but certain provisions wereremanded to the EPA for further consideration. Accordingly, EPA is notacting on three sources (Public Service Authority_Winyah, South CarolinaElectric and Gas Company (SCE andamp; G)_Bowater, and SCE andamp; G_Williams)because they currently receive credit under one of the provisions remandedto the EPA. South Carolina and EPA will review these sources for compliancewith any revised requirements when EPA completes rulemaking to respondto the <T3>NRDC </T3>remand.<ITAG tagnum="84">EPA Review</ITAG>EPA has reviewed South Carolina's submittal and concurs with the conclusionthat no revisions to South Carolina's existing source emission limitationsare necessary as a result of EPA's revised stack height regulations. SouthCarolina has therefore met its obligations under Section 406 of Pub. L.95-95 for existing source emission limitations. (EPA approved South Carolina'sstack height rules for new sources on May 28, 1987 (52 FR 19858)).<ITAG tagnum="84">Final Action</ITAG>EPA approves the declaration by South Carolina that recent revisions toEPA's stack height regulations do not necessitate SIP revisions for specificsources in this State. EPA proposed to approve the declaration on January8, 1989 (54 FR 1953). The declaration does not apply to Public ServiceAuthority_Winyah, SCE andamp; G_Bowater, and SCE andamp; G_Williams.Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, petitions for judicial review of thisaction must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriatecircuit by June 12, 1989. This action may not be challenged later in proceedingsto enforce its requirements. (See 307(b)(2))The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52</ITAG>Air pollution control, Intergovernmental relations, Particulate matter,Sulfur oxides.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: April 3, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Joe R.
