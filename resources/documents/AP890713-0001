The Green River case involves the deaths of 41 women and thedisappearance of at least eight others in Washington state andOregon in 1982-85. Most of the victims were young and almost allwere linked to prostitution.   Former law student William Jay Stevens II, 38, was named in anaffidavit made public Thursday. The affidavit was filed to support asearch warrant for two of Stevens' residences in Spokane, 290 mileseast of Seattle.   The searches Wednesday yielded a truckload of crime reports,maps, credit card receipts, 1,800 videotapes, 14 police badges andtwo Seattle police uniform shirts, other court documents showed.   Stevens is serving a one-year term in the King County Jail forthe burglary of a police equipment supply store in Seattle in 1979.   Police say Stevens walked away from a work-release program in1981 and was not located until last December, when he was in hisfinal year at the Gonzaga University law school in Spokane. He wasarrested and returned to jail Jan. 9.   Stevens has not been charged in the Green River investigation.   His father, William Stevens Sr., when reached by telephone inSpokane on Thursday, said, ``I've been advised by my attorney not toanswer any questions.''   The Green River case takes its name from the river south ofSeattle where the bodies of the first five victims were found. Mostof the bodies were found in the Seattle area. Four were found inPortland, Ore.   The tip to Stevens' whereabouts came in a call from Portland,Ore., after a television program last December about the Green Riverkillings, police said.   The search warrant for a house rented by Stevens and for hisparents' house said there was ``probable cause to believe that thecrime of murder has been committed.''   Green River investigators have long theorized that the victimsmight have been lured into the killer's car by someone posing as apolice officer or otherwise in a position of trust.   ``One of the things that was speculated ... the killer could be acop or someone posing as a cop,'' King County Police Capt. BobEvans, commander of the multi-agency Green River Task Force, saidThursday.   Before Stevens was arrested in January, Spokane police determinedthat he owned a former Everett, Wash., police car which had beenequipped and made to appear like a real police car, the affidavitsaid.   The police car had been falsely registered by Stevens, who hadrepresented himself as the police chief of Spangle, a town 15 milessouth of Spokane.   Part of the investigation includes a time line which traces histravels from Seattle to Portland to Vancouver, British Columbia, andto Spokane.   The 405 entries on the 1981-88 time-line ``tended to placeStevens in the area during the time space of a Green River victim'sdisappearance,'' the affidavit said.   ``None of the documented contacts, telephone records or creditcard charges served to eliminate Stevens as a suspect in any of theGreen River cases,'' the affidavit said.   ``Instead, interviews and records have produced the followingfacts that tend to establish that Stevens is a viable suspect in theGreen River homicides,'' the document said.   Other material taken in the searches included boxes of 1982newspapers, Portland sex crime reports and Portland police crimesynopses from 1983.   The affidavit said task force files contained several tipssuggesting Stevens might have been linked to the killings.</TEXT></DOC>
