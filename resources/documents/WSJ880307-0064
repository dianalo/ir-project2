Are we so softened by the post-World War II decades of high consumption and low productivity, of much borrowing and little saving, that we simply cannot change our ways, however urgently we may need to do so?    Or are we at bottom a good deal tougher and more resilient than our own political leaders recognize or the record of the Reagan years suggests, with all the tax-rate cutting and ever-mounting outlays for &quot;entitlements&quot; for one and all.    There are ways to gain at least a glimmer of an answer, a rough measure of our stomach to be competitive over the long haul ahead in a world economy where U.S. clout is sharply eroded. But much depends on how one opts to approach the question.    One way yields disheartening conclusions, tending to re-enforce the image, popular especially abroad, of a citizenry lacking fortitude. This is simply to observe the presidential derby, not so much for what the assorted contenders are saying from state to state as for voter reaction to what is being said.    The message coming through for any candidate so bold as to focus openly, for example, on our need to curb consumption and save more, is, bluntly stated: Get lost.    Consider, in this regard, the fate of a lone fortitudinous contender, Bruce Babbitt, the former Arizona governor, a Democrat, whose prescriptions include such distasteful medicine as a national consumption tax. In mid-February, after a sorry fifth-place finish in the Iowa caucuses and a sorrier sixth place in the New Hampshire primary, he abandoned the race.    Mr. Babbitt's rivals stamped his tax ideas &quot;regressive&quot; and when he withdrew he observed, as this newspaper reported, that &quot;we are still, on both sides, running a presidential campaign that is avoiding reality {and} we can't have an honest dialogue about the economic changes we need.&quot;    The clear inference from the Babbitt showing -- as well as from the relative success of contenders assiduously avoiding any such painful talk -- is that the populace remains averse to even a modicum of belt-tightening. What comes across, ultimately, is a highly unflattering impression of the national mind-set.    And yet there is another way -- less simple but more encouraging -- to try to gauge our willingness to face what Mr. Babbitt calls &quot;reality.&quot; This is to consider the remarkable public response, so far at least, to what various barometers tell us has been happening for a considerable while now to the general U.S. living standard.    The readings show at best stagnation, at worst a marked decline. Personal income, adjusted for population growth, inflation and seasonal factors, was lower through much of 1987 than in 1986, and only very recently has begun to edge above year-earlier levels. Consumer spending, similarly adjusted, shows equally lackluster behavior.    Other gauges denote actual decline. Average weekly earnings, again inflation-adjusted, were lower in 1987 than in any year since 1982, a time of deep recession. A similar measure of hourly earnings follows roughly the same sad pattern.    Even such barometers, it should be added, tend really to understate the situation because, quite obviously, the measuring is done in dollars, albeit inflation-adjusted ones, and the dollar's global worth has shriveled sharply in the last few years. And, in an increasingly interdependent world economy, living standards increasingly must be judged within a global context, not simply in terms of a particular country's own currency, even if inflation has been taken into account. In such terms, by any earnings measure, the U.S. living standard has fallen sharply in the last few years.    Indeed, studies by Edward S. Hyman Jr., chief economist for the investment firm of C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc., lead him to conclude that in terms of such relatively strong currencies as the Japanese yen Americans are enduring &quot;a major recession in purchasing power.&quot;    Such findings may come as no surprise, but the public response to this living-standard &quot;recession&quot; seems remarkable, even stoical, for the general lack of complaint, for the readiness to cope with new, less pleasant circumstances.    It may be, of course, that the painful facts haven't yet sunk in, and when they do the reaction will range from strident protectionism to new highs of rancor in the work place. It helps that record-setting payroll-employment numbers grab larger headlines and read more easily than, say, per-capita, disposable, inflation-adjusted personal income, expressed in deutsche marks, Swiss francs or yen. It helps, too, that the Democratic challengers inexplicably overlook the matter. (Albert Sindlinger, a consumer pollster in Media, Pa., says that even the candidates &quot;don't realize what's been happening to our living standard.&quot;)    A more encouraging -- and let us hope more accurate -- interpretation of the public response is that the painful facts are indeed well recognized, but so is the necessity to belt-tighten. The people, in brief, are large steps ahead of their leaders and possess a lot more gumption than is suggested, for example, in the presidential contest.    Such a view won't neatly fit into any computer-based forecast, but it would, if it proves accurate, mark a huge, if imponderable, plus in the economic outlook. </TEXT></DOC>
