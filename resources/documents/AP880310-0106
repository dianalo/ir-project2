(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal appeals judge has temporarilyhalted attempts by the Internal Revenue Service to revoke thetax-exempt status of PTL, the evangelical empire founded by JimBakker.   In an order filed late Wednesday in Richmond, Va., 4th U.S.Circuit Court of Appeals Judge William Wilkins stayed a lower courtruling revoking PTL's tax exemption. Wilkins set a March 31 hearingin Greenville, S.C., where lawyers for PTL are expected to arguethat loss of its tax-exempt status would be a death blow to theorganization.   Wilkins' stay gives PTL breathing room as it tries to meet a May1 deadline to reorganize itself with a new tax exemption under theprotection of the federal bankruptcy court.   ``We see this as being pivotal to the preservation of PTL as weknow it,'' said one PTL attorney who spoke on condition he was notidentified.   PTL has debts of more than $60 million and is trying to raiseabout $4 million by May 2. Revocation of its tax-exempt status,which it has enjoyed since 1973, could frighten away thousands ofpeople who might contribute to PTL, the lawyer said.   The matter reached Wilkins on appeal from a Monday order by U.S.District Judge Karen Henderson. Ms. Henderson ruled that the IRScould revoke PTL's tax-exempt status, overturning a December orderby a U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge.   ``If it is subsequently determined that the District Courtincorrectly reversed the Bankruptcy Court, there is a greatlikelihood that PTL and those having a financial interest in itwill suffer irreparable injury,'' Wilkins wrote.   The IRS wants to revoke PTL's status retroactively to 1981 andhas said it would seek at least $55.7 million in back taxes.   In effect, the IRS has suggested that former PTL leader Bakkerwasn't running a ministry but a profitable business for himself,relatives and friends.</TEXT></DOC>
