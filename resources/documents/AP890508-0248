Skilled welders are almost an endangered species, and theshortage of welders and welding engineers means security andadvancement for those who choose this field, according to theAmerican Welding Society.   ``Welders are leaving or retiring at an annual rate of nearly 18percent, with a severely inadequate number of replacements comingalong in our schools today,'' says John M. Gerken, president of thesociety. ``Our requirements exceed our actual replacements bynearly three to one.''   The society projects the shortage well into the next century,and that will positively affect salary and advancement. Gerken saysthat welders currently earn from $10 to $25 per hour, depending ontheir skills and the locations. A welding engineer with a four-yearcollege degree can expect to start at about $30,000 a year.   The options for welders is wide, too, Gerken says. Many welderscan become engineers, educators, designers, researchers or managersas they add to their education and experience.   Thought to be about 6,000 years old, the welding professiontoday covers major and basic industries such as aerospace,automotive, construction, electronics, metalwork, nuclear power andshipbuilding. The field's newer technologies include working withlasers, microjoining, plasmas and robotics.   Gerken says that the potential welder should have goodmechanical aptitude, mathematical skills, a logical mind,imagination, and the ability to work as a team member. Educationrequirements range from high school vocational courses to collegedegree programs.</TEXT></DOC>
