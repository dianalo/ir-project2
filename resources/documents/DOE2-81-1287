Some of these variantswere stable and were more resistant to adriamycine and more sensitiveto ethanol and Triton X-100, similarly as multi-drug resistant Chinesehamster cells that have an altered permeability barrier to weakly hydrophobicdrugs. The change in susceptibility to drugs in L51178Y variants wasnot related to transplantability into DBA/2 mice (with 1 exception) anddid not affect radiosensitivity or resistance to anti-tumor platinumcomplexes. 36 refs., 6 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
