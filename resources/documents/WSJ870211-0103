The Union of Concerned Scientists, long critical of commercial nuclear safety and the Babcock andamp; Wilcox plants specifically, recommended closing the plants and revoking construction permits for two others until major safety-related changes are made. Babcock andamp; Wilcox is a unit of McDermott Inc., New Orleans.    The scientists' group also began an advertising and public relations campaign aimed at stirring concern about the facilities among people living near them.    Meanwhile, in testimony before the House Energy and Power Subcommittee, three consultants to the Energy Department expressed doubts that the agency is making adequate safety improvements at its weapons-producing N-reactor at Hanford, Wash., during a six-month closure.    Officials of both the NRC and the Energy Department, however, said they are confident the nuclear plants don't present undue risks to the public health and safety.    Dennis Crutchfield, chief of an NRC staff review of the Babcock andamp; Wilcox plants, said he would review the petition from the scientists' group. But he added, &quot;I haven't seen anything to change my conclusion that the plants are safe and can continue to operate.&quot;    Concerning the Hanford reactor, Mary Walker, assistant Secretary of Energy for environment, safety and health, told the House panel that her agency plans improvements that would cost &quot;several times&quot; the $50 million slated for the six-month upgrading that began Jan. 7. But she insisted that the reactor posed no undue risk even without the repairs.    The eight Babcock andamp; Wilcox plants currently licensed for operation are Duke Power Co.'s Oconee 1, 2 and 3, Greenville, S.C.; Arkansas Power andamp; Light Co.'s Arkansas 1, Russellville, Ark.; Florida Power Corp.'s Crystal River, Red Level, Fla.; Toledo Edison Co.'s Davis-Besse, Oak Harbor, Ohio; Sacramento Municipal Utility District's Rancho Seco, near Sacramento, Calif.; and General Public Utilities Corp.'s Three Mile Island 1, near Harrisburg, Pa. The Tennessee Valley Authority holds permits to build two Babcock andamp; Wilcox plants, the Bellefonte 1 and 2 at Scottsboro, Ala.    The challenge to Babcock andamp; Wilcox plants is likely to wind up in court. The NRC is required to respond in writing reasonably quickly, and federal law allows the petitioners to seek further relief from the federal appeals court here.    The NRC has recognized for years that Babcock andamp; Wilcox reactors are more vulnerable to mishaps than other models. It reviewed their shortcomings after the 1979 accident that destroyed Three Mile Island's Unit 2, a Babcock andamp; Wilcox plant.    &quot;The unique Bandamp;W design makes the reactors extremely sensitive to even minor failures, problems that would be innocuous in other pressurized water reactors,&quot; said Robert Pollard, a nuclear safety engineer for the scientists' group. One weakness, he claimed, is that the reactors' relatively small steam generators and pressurizers make them vulnerable to rapid swings in temperature and pressure.    The NRC has delegated most of the safety review to a group representing owners of the eight plants. Last July 16, the NRC's advisory committee on reactor safeguards complained that the owners group's &quot;main emphasis seemed to be directed at improving plant on-line performance, rather than addressing the safety objectives&quot; of regulators.    The NRC's Mr. Crutchfield said the advisory committee has since given &quot;tacit approval&quot; to the work being done by the owners group under NRC staff oversight. </TEXT></DOC>
