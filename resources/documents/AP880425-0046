Exact injury figures were not available, but as of today, policereported 87 cases of election-related violence nationwide, with 140people detained and 77 of them formally charged so far.   On election eve, an opposition party accused police themselvesand governing party members of beating up about a dozen rankingopposition members in a dispute over campaign tactics.   Firebombs and rocks have been thrown at campaign rallies and atpolitical party offices, and rival supporters have clashed oversuch things as the content of campaign leaflets and the placementor removal of posters.   Anti-government students shouting ``Down with the militarydictatorship!'' have hurled rocks and firebombs at riot police,although student protests are a regular feature in South Korea.   On Sunday, police said they arrested four students in thesoutheastern city of Taegu for allegedly throwing a firebomb at agoverning party candidate as he spoke at a rally. No one wasreported injured.   Yun Il-yung, chairman of the Central Election ManagementCommittee, expressed his regret in a statement today overcorruption and violence in what he called an overheated campaign.   In a news conference in Pusan today, opposition leader KimYoung-sam called the government a ``gangster regime,'' saying itwas resorting to violence to try to win Tuesday's election.   He charged that governing party workers had beaten up orkidnapped eight people in Pusan, including the son of his fellowReunification Democratic Party candidate Kim Kwang-il.   Kim Young-sam said the governing Democratic Justice Party hadorganized about 100 gangs in each election district to intimidateopposition members.   In Seoul, Reunification Democratic Party spokesman charged in astatement that police and governing party members beat up a dozenReunification Democratic Party members when 30 opposition members,including some candidates, went to a police station on Sunday toprotest the detention of student volunteer campaign workers forallegedly pasting opposition stickers on governing party posters.   Last Thursday, in his first news conference since taking officein February, President Roh Tae-woo accused the opposition partiesof fomenting unrest. In a warning to both sides, he said: ``Whoeverviolates the law and destroys democratic order must be punishedseverely in the name of the people.''   Tens of thousands of police in full riot gear turned out toguard nearly 170 joint campaign rallies over the weekend thatmarked the end of major campaign activity.   Today, campaign rules barred candidates from speeches orhouse-to-house visits, but handing out of leaflets still waspermitted.   Press reports said 20 governing party members beat up sixsupporters of opposition leader Kim Dae-jung's Party for Peace andDemocracy early today in Haenam, south of Kwangju, and 70 Party forPeace and Democracy members retaliated by throwing firebombs androcks at a district governing party office, injuring two of itsmembers.   In Chongsong, south of Seoul, police today said they werelooking for five governing party members on charges of breakinginto a district office of the New Democratic Republican Party andbeating up candidate Nam Sang-kul and three other people.   There also were press reports in Seoul of opposition partymembers seizing governing party members, claiming they weredistributing leaflets that slandered opposition candidates.   Police reported detaining 173 people throughout the country inconnection with non-violent election law violations, and formallycharging 120 of them.
