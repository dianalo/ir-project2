The giant utility said it expects conservation measureswill result in a 10,000 megawatt savings by the year 2014, upfrom an original estimate of 5,600 megawatts. It saidindependent power producers will supply about 4,200 megawattsof electricity by 2014, while the utility expects to continueimports of electricity from other Canadian provinces and willseek permission for the expansion of existing hydraulicgeneration facilities.</LP><TEXT>   The utility, which supplies all of Ontario's electricityneeds, filed a revision to its 25-year supply and demandplan, now under review by Ontario's Environmental AssessmentBoard. The board began studying the plan, which originallycalled for at least two additional nuclear generatingfacilities to be in operation by 2014, after the province'snewly elected socialist government put a freeze onconstruction of new nuclear power plants.   While Marc Eliesen, chairman of Ontario Hydro, saidnuclear facilities should still be considered as an option,he told the board he believes there won't be a need forconstruction of large-scale facilities until at least 2009,seven years later than originally estimated.   He said that by holding off on major supply options,Ontario Hydro is avoiding building expensive generatingcapacity before it is needed. &quot;The deferral of new supplywill reduce our borrowing to 2014 by about C$9 billion,&quot; hesaid.   Previously, Mr. Eliesen had noted that two years of flatdemand also has helped push back the date for new nuclearfacilities. While he said the recession is expected to curbelectricity demand again this year, officials of thestate-owned utility anticipate a surge in consumption by theturn of the century and an average 2.4% growth rate over thelife of the plan.</TEXT></DOC>
