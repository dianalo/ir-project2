At issue is an obscure-sounding provision under whichutilities that repower their power plants to install certainadvanced technologies get four additional years -- to 2004 --to cut their emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxideto levels required by the new law. A liberal view of whichtechnologies and utilities qualify could make the law fail tomeet its stated aim of cutting sulfur dioxide emissions fromthe nation's utilities 50% from 1980 levels by 2000.</LP><TEXT>   Environmentalists and some administration officials arguethat the interpretation advocated by Energy Departmentofficials could allow three million to four million more tonsof pollution during those four years, compared with400,000-to-one million tons under the stricter position ofthe Environmental Protection Agency. &quot;A broad definition willmean that most, if not all, utility plants will be able todelay compliance by four years,&quot; contends David Hawkins,senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council.&quot;That would mean millions of extra tons of sulfur dioxide andnitrogen oxide going into the air during those four years.&quot;   The repowering dispute comes as the Bush administration isalready being accused of using the regulation-writing processto benefit industry by weakening Clean Air Act provisions. Aproposal released earlier this year, for example, wouldsoften requirements under which factories must limitpollution to levels specified in permits filed with thegovernment. The repowering issue, which is also beingreviewed by the White House Budget Office and the President'sCouncil on Competitiveness, is expected to be decided asearly as next week at a White House meeting where other acidrain matters will be considered.   The provision is part of a sweeping package of Clean AirAct rules that the EPA is planning to propose soon that willforce the nation's utilities to spend $4 billion to $5billion annually by early next century to reduce the acidrain that is damaging lakes and waterways in the Northeast.The extension was designed to benefit certainpollution-reduction technologies that looked promising butthat couldn't necessarily become commercially viable in timeto meet the law's deadlines.   Energy Department officials deny that their interpretationwould allow additional pollution beyond what Congressintended and contend they are satisfied with a JusticeDepartment ruling last week that in large part supports theEPA view.   An Energy Department memo dated Oct. 8, however, stillcalls for allowing technologies that don't necessarilyinvolve the replacement or substantial rebuilding of a powerplant's boiler as long as these technologies control morethan one type of emission and significantly improve theplant's efficiency and waste-reduction capabilities. The memospecifically calls for automatically including a technologyknown as the advanced slagging combustor, which doesn'tnecessarily involve replacing a plant's boiler.   Environmentalists argue this interpretation would push thenumber of qualifying utilities significantly beyond thenumber that would be allowed if a substantial rebuilding ofthe plant's boiler were required, as the EPA advocates.   Linda Stuntz, deputy undersecretary for policy, said thememo was &quot;between lawyers designed to advance the process ofnegotiating this issue. It doesn't represent the last word.&quot;   Among other contentious issues to be decided at the WhiteHouse meeting is how tough to make the rules utilities mustfollow in monitoring their emissions. In response to utilitycomplaints, the EPA softened the rules contained in anearlier draft but probably not enough to satisfy its industrycritics. At issue are the procedures the power plants mustfollow when their pollution-measuring instruments aren'tworking and what they must do to demonstrate that theirinstruments aren't biased.</TEXT></DOC>
