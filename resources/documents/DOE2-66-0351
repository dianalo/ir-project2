In itsindustry-wide research program, the Occupational Health Studies Groupat the University of North Carolina has encountered a variety of problemsand has explored means of dealing with some of them. Among the resultsof this effort are some ideas on needs and opportunities for future industry-widestudies. The almost universal availability and application of computersmake systematic record keeping appropriate for occupational health researchpurposes a reasonable and practical matter for industry. Some types ofrecords and information systems which will greatly facilitate futureoccupational health research projects have been identified. In analysisof worker health status records there is a clear need for appropriatereference populations of workers. The generation of the mortality andmorbidity data base for such use may be a worthwhile governmental activity.Industry represents not only the entity within which industry-wide occupationalhealth research can be conducted, but the institutions through whichthe good health of workers can be promoted. Both the prevention of healthhazards and the promotion of good health serve the interest of workers,industry, and society.</TEXT></DOC>
