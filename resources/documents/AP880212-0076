Armando Estrada, 28, Roman Rodriguez, 31, and Arturo De La Vega,28, were among the original seven Miami police defendants whosefirst trial ended in a hung jury last year.   In all, more than 70 of the department's 1,033 officers havebeen arrested, fired or suspended since the investigation ofcorruption began three years ago.   U.S. District Judge Kenneth L. Ryskamp told the three during thesentencing hearing that they shamed their entire profession duringthe sentencing hearing.   ``When I was a boy I thought a police officer must be thehighest calling ... but young people today have the perception of apolice officer as one who is corrupt,'' he said.   Miami Police Chief Clarence Dickson, however, said the officersarrested do not reflect on the integrity of his department. ``Themajority of the men and women on the streets are honest, upstandingcops.''   A fourth defendant, Ricardo Aleman, who was convicted onnarcotics and tax counts last year, was given a delay in sentencinguntil Feb. 26.</TEXT></DOC>
