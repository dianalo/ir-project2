<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-12-0162 </DOCNO><TEXT>Complete integrability of the supersymmetric two-dimensional sine-Gordonfield-theoretical model is proved in the framework of the Hamiltonianinterpretation of the inverse problem method. The classical r-matrixof this model is computed and shown to be equivalent to the r-matrixof the Grassmann Thirring model. Creation-annihilation variables areconstructed and the elementary excitation spectrum is determined.</TEXT></DOC>
