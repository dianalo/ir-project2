SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Thirty-nine, that magic age teetering betweenyouth and maturity, will be the most typical age for Americans earlyin the next century, according to Census Bureau projections.   Historically a nation of youthful orientation, the United Statesis now thirty-something, heading upward, the Bureau reports.   Combining to increase the median age of the population are thematuring of the massive post World War II Baby Boom and thatgeneration's relatively low birth rates, which reduce the number ofbabies to pull down the numbers.   So if present trends continue, census officials expect that halfof all Americans will be over the age of 39 by the year 2010, andhalf younger. The agency's most recent estimate of median age was31.7, as of 1986.   Whether America will plateau at 39 _ as did the late comedianJack Benny _ remains to be seen.   The median age of the country touched 30 for the first time in1950, then slipped back as the Baby Boom produced a bouncing crop ofyoungsters to lower the numbers.   It took until the 1980 census to hit 30 again, edged up to 31.7as of 1986 and is expected to climb to 33 by 1990, 36.5 by 2000 and39 by the year 2010, according to the new projections from theCensus Bureau.   Despite the aging of the population, however, the reportanticipates that the so-called dependency ratio will decline.   That ratio is the number of people under 18 and over 65 comparedto the number of people of working age in between. The younger andolder groups are most likely to ``depend'' on those working.   The 1986 ratio of 62.2 dependents per 100 workers is expected toslip to 56.7 by the year 2010, with the low birth rate reducing thenumber of young dependents to a greater extent than aging adds tothe older group.   While there have been reports of increases in the total number ofbirths in the last few years, that is because the giant Baby Boomgeneration is largely in its prime childbearing years. The rate ofbirths per 1,000 remains well below that of the post-World War IIperiod.   The new census study also estimates that the nation's blackpopulation will increase to 13.7 percent by 2010. Blacks made up11.8 percent of the population in the 1980 census.   Nearly one in five Southerners will be black in 2010, 19.7percent of the population. That will be up from 18.7 percent in 1980.   In the Northeast, blacks will increase from 10.1 percent to 13.2percent. They will go from 9.1 percent to 11.9 percent in theMidwest and from 5.3 percent to 6.3 percent in the West.   The projections show the Northeast remaining the oldest sectionof the country, with the median age for that region increasing from33.6 in 1986 to 40.3 in 2010.   The South will be second in 2010 at a median age of 38.4, up from31.4 in 1986. The Midwest will mature from 31.6 to 38.8 and the Westwill go from 31.0 to 37.4.   Florida will remain the state with the highest median age andUtah will still be the youngest state, according to the projections.   Florida, with a median age of 36.0 in 1986, will age to 45.3.Utah's median will rise from 25.5 to 27.6, leaving it the only statewith a median age below 30 years, thanks largely to a continuinghigh birth rate.   In the 1986 estimates no state had a median over 40 but severalwere under 30, including _ besides Utah _ Alaska, Idaho, Louisiana,Mississippi, New Mexico, Texas and Wyoming.   In 2010 not only Florida will have topped 40. Other states withmedian ages above that milestone will include Arkansas, Connecticut,Iowa, Maine, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island,Tennessee, Washington and West Virginia.</TEXT></DOC>
