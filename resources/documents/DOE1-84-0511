Long-range as well as short-rangedevelopment studies are needed to provide a proper integration sequencefor the industry. A recursive mixed-integer programming model of thepetrochemical industry is presented. The model provides the sequenceof short steps needed to achieve a specified long-range development plan.An application of the model to detect an optimal integration sequencefor the Mexican petrochemical industry is presented. The results of themodel also provide the basis for a further economic analysis of the resultingintegration plan for the chemical industry. The decision-maker wouldthen analyze the impact of a given development policy taking into accountfactors such as the reduction of imports, the potential export capability,the investment requirements, and the yearly cost of subsidies that wouldbe required to meet that development program.</TEXT></DOC>
