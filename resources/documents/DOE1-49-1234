The wavefunctions used for the 'target' states arethe same as those employed in previous R-matrix calculations for collisionalexcitation of C III and for energy levels of C II. The average differencebetween f values calculated using the length and velocity operators is3.7%. Calculated lifetimes for 11 C II levels are in good agreement withthose from accurate measurements by previous workers. The calculatedf values are at least as accurate as those obtained in the best previouswork on C II. The methods used are very efficient.</TEXT></DOC>
