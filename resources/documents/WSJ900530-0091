The victory enables Mr. Gorbachev's outspoken rival toestablish an opposing center of power in the Soviet Union'slargest republic. A longstanding critic of Mr. Gorbachev'smoderate efforts at economic overhaul, Mr. Yeltsin can usehis new platform to whip up public sentiment for his owndemands for more radical and speedy change.</LP><TEXT>   After his victory, Mr. Yeltsin got a standing ovation fromthe federation parliament, and his election led the eveningtelevision news, while Mr. Gorbachev's arrival in the Westwas buried 25 minutes into the broadcast.   Still, it was hardly a sweeping victory -- three rounds ofvoting were held in the parliament before Mr. Yeltsin scrapedby with a margin of only four votes. And in his new role, Mr.Yeltsin will have to restrain his bombastic manner and seekcompromise in the fiercely divided 1,060-seat legislature.   Indeed, political analysts say it was a promise by Mr.Yeltsin to build a coalition in the parliament that finallyswayed some conservative hard-liners to his side. Under suchconstraints, the 59-year-old Mr. Yeltsin could be an engineforcing Mr. Gorbachev into riskier reforms.   &quot;Maybe in this combination, Gorbachev will have morechances to be decisive and radical,&quot; said Rair Simonyan, asenior economist at the Institute of World Economy. &quot;He needsa person who can call a spade a spade.&quot;   Mr. Yeltsin immediately extended a conciliatory hand toMr. Gorbachev. &quot;I'll build our relationship on abusiness-like basis, on the basis of dialogue andnegotiation, not confrontation,&quot; he told Interfax news agencyafter his victory.   Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Gorbachev used to be allies in theearly days of Mr. Gorbachev's leadership. Handpicked as firstsecretary of the Moscow Communist Party in 1985, the bruskformer builder bullied officials for corruption and purgeddozens of top city officials. Mr. Yeltsin helped Mr.Gorbachev by proposing the most radical reforms, leaving Mr.Gorbachev the middle road.   But by 1987, he had become too great a risk for Mr.Gorbachev and was ousted from the party job. Last spring, ina remarkable comeback, Mr. Yeltsin won a place in the Sovietnational parliament with 89% of the vote in his constituency.Lately, as Mr. Gorbachev faces rising fury over the lack ofgoods in stores and demands for independence by somerepublics, Mr. Yeltsin has been accused of stirring updiscontent for his own gain.   Mr. Yeltsin stood for election in a brand-new parliamentwhose members, including himself, were elected only recentlyin the first free election for the Russian Federation. Mr.Yeltsin leads the Democratic Bloc, an alliance of liberal,pro-reform members, but more than half the members of theparliament are conservative members of the party.   Mr. Gorbachev campaigned hard against Mr. Yeltsin, at onepoint telling the Russian parliament that Mr. Yeltsin wasleading the Soviet Union away from socialism. Two rounds ofvotes were held in which Communist Party-backed candidates,the Russian Federation's standing Prime Minister AlexanderVlasov and then hard-liner Ivan Poloskov, failed to gain amajority, as did Mr. Yeltsin.   Mr. Yeltsin's final victory is largely credited to hislast-minute pledge to build a coalition. Some analysts sayMr. Gorbachev approved the Yeltsin option only late Monday onthe guarantee that a conservative would be deputy chairman.   As president of the Russian Federation, Mr. Yeltsin nowleads the biggest Soviet republic, stretching 5,000 milesfrom Kaliningrad on the Baltic to the Far East, and home toabout half the nation's population. A major theme of hiscampaign was greater political and economic autonomy for hisrepublic within the Soviet Union. He isn't known as adedicated supporter of secession movements in the Balticrepublics, but his increased power could strengthen thenationalist movements that threaten to fracture the nation.   More immediately, his opposition to Mr. Gorbachev'shalting economic reforms could undermine the leadership'sprogram. The presentation last week in parliament of theprogram included three stages of price reform, starting withprice rises for bread from July 1. The program is still underdebate by parliament, but the presentation immediatelysparked a new rash of hoarding. Reports of panic-buying werehard to confirm, but during the weekend, lines seemed longerthan usual.   On Monday, rationing was imposed in Moscow to stem thehoarding; shoppers must present internal passports. Thecontrols seem to have brought a slight improvement. Still,many Soviets fear rationing will be permanent even though thegovernment says it is temporary.</TEXT></DOC>
