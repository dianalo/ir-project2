In fact, government experts see a 1988 reversal in the economy'sdeclining energy consumption.   The Energy Department's semiautonomous Energy InformationAdministration recently revised upward its estimate of Britishthermal units used per dollar of gross national product last year.The estimate went from 19,900 to 20,000 Btu, the same as in 1986,said information administration economist Jerry Lagace.   The estimate for the first three months of 1988 is for anincrease ``so large I don't believe it,'' Lagace said, although headded, ``This will probably be revised downward.''   The United States began becoming more energy efficient in themid-1970s, after a 1973 oil embargo by the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries showed how dependent Americans wereon imported oil. Gasoline prices rose steeply after the firstembargo and again after a second oil embargo in 1979.   As a result of the oil shocks, U.S. energy useage declined anaverage of 2.5 percent each year after 1976.   Although there are numerous explanations for the reversal inenergy efficiency, the simplest is the low oil prices of recentmonths.   Last year's 94.8 cent average price in the United States for agallon of unleaded regular gasoline was the lowest ever, afterfactoring out inflation.   Another possible explanation for the reversal of energyefficiency is the turnaround in U.S. industrial production.According to estimates by the International Energy Agency in Paris,about half of the past gains in U.S. industrial energy efficiencycame from the decline of heavy industry in the economy.   But as the operating rates at American factories, mines andutilities rise, many companies are restarting older, less-efficientequipment or delaying retirement of the equipment. In addition, therecent revival in American exports has been paced by many productsthat take lots of energy to produce, such as construction equipment.   Adding to the turnaround in energy use are homeowners who havebeen wary of making long-term energy-efficiency investments.   Several studies have shown that homeowners, offered low-costdeals and interest-free loans by utilities, turn up their noses ifthe payoff will take more than six months.   The same is true of many businesses, said Mark Ross, Universityof Michigan physicist studying energy problems. Ross said that hefinds on his visits to factories that ``people are not strugglingwith how the process might be improved. They are worried aboutlabor relations, product quality, all the regulations that theymust comply with. Management and engineering staffs are stretchedto the limit.''   ``Energy is very cheap here,'' said Art Rosenfeld, director ofthe Center for Building Science at the Lawrence Berkeley NationalLaboratory at Berkeley, Calif., who has worked with Ross.   ``When you and I were growing up, they flared natural gas, andwe built a lot of uninsulated houses because it was cheaper to burnmore gas than to add insulation.''   Attitudes change slowly, so ``we haven't paid attention toinvestments that take five, six or seven years to pay back, likethe Germans and the Japanese do,'' Rosenfeld said.   Today, the average U.S. new car must get 26 miles per gallon andall cars average 18.9 mpg, 42 per cent better than in 1973.However, the average car in Italy, where gas is four times the U.S.price, gets 30 mpg. In Japan, the average is 31 mpg.   In the overall economy, counting cars, buildings, factories andeverything else, the United States still uses more energy perdollar than any other country but Canada, according to the EnergyInformation Administration mesurements.   The United States was 24 percent below Canada, but 97 percentabove West Germany and 110 percent above Japan.</TEXT></DOC>
