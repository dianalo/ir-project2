In addition, the company's senior vice president, Terrence Geoghegan, was ordered to pay a $10,000 fine and was sentenced to a six-month suspended prison term and one year's probation.    The company and Mr. Geoghegan pleaded guilty in March to the criminal charges, the first ever brought under the law for filling in a federally protected wetland, according to the U.S. attorney's office.    The government charged that Mr. Geoghegan and Marathon knowingly violated the law when in 1986 it filled in five acres of a wetland in Seekonk, Mass., to construct a shopping mall parking lot. </TEXT></DOC>
