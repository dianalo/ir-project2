The space-periodicmagnetic field of the lens is presented as a Fourier series; the amplitudesof harmoinics that are functionals of the bend shape of conductors inthe winding are written out. The free parameters, i.e. the Fourier-harmonicamplitudes and the field period, can be optimized with respect to thebeam dynamics, owing to the choice of the conductors bend shape in thewinding. At decreasing the len aperture its focusing strength enhancesand simultaneously there appears a possibility of shortening the magneticfield period without reduction of the field amplitude. This circumstancecan be used with the lens proposed for the precise beam focusing. 5 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
