'' Parker said.andM;Typefaces are available from many sources, the main choices being residentprinter fonts (firmware), font cartridges and boards (hardware) or soft fonts(software).andM;''The choices are confusing,'' admitted Robert Fenchel, president ofSoftCraft Inc., a Madison, Wis., supplier of font technology.andP;  ''You can buya PostScript printer where many fonts are resident in the printer.andP;  Thisgives you less control over font selection, is expensive and slow, but italso simplifies the options.''andM;In the non-PostScript world of Hewlett-Packard Co. equipment, cartridges arethe easiest but least flexible solution, Fenchel said.andP;  ''You can't switchcartridges in the middle of a task, and they aren't easy to use on a network.andM;''To some extent, font software is a poor man's desktop publisher because youcan use your existing printer,'' Fenchel added.andM;Still, he believes software fonts also offer the greatest choice, flexibilityand cost savings.andP;  The biggest disadvantages to soft fonts, he said, are thetime it takes to transfer the font to the printer and the current lack ofmobility in digital typesetters.andM;Frigitronics' Hicks agreed that while professional desktop publishing mayrequire PostScript, the sensible solution for an office environment is to usesoft fonts.andM;''Most office correspondence is done with smaller typefaces -- 13 points orbelow.andP;  You begin to see the difference between PostScript and downloadablesoft fonts in the vicinity of 18 to 24 points,'' he explained.andP;  Many experts,however, argue that soft fonts printed on a 300-dot-per-inch (dpi) device aresuperior to PostScript output at the same resolution.andM;Hicks suggested that users who require high-end typeset output useHewlett-Packard's LaserJet printer with its soft fonts as a proofing device,and then redirect the file's output to a PostScript device.andM;Soft fonts are available in both bit-mapped and outline formats.andP;  Bit-mappedfonts are made from an array of pixels, and the dot patterns are stored ondisk in a fixed point size.andP;  Outline fonts, by contrast, contain the point,line, arc and curve information that represent the shape of a character.andO;Outline fonts are quickly gaining favor because a single outline can bescaled to any size and at any resolution.andM;Outline fonts must first be converted to bit maps before they are used.andP;  Theconversion can occur within the printer, as with PostScript, or it can occuron the PC and be downloaded to the printer.andM;Bitstream's fonts for non-PostScript printers convert the outline and storethe bit map on disk.andP;  Others, such as SWFTE Inc.'s Glyphix, convert theoutline on the fly and download to the printer.andM;Bitstream, which holds a patent on its font-scaling technology, offered thefirst source of digital outline fonts that was independent of any hardware orsoftware product.andP;  The market for user outline fonts has since grown toencompass a number of prolific vendors.andP;  While offering more options,companies such as Agfa Corp.'s Compugraphic Division, Adobe Systems Inc.,andO;SoftCraft and others also add confusion to the marketplace.andM;The sources for soft fonts further adds to the confusion.andP;  There arelibraries of typefaces for both users and OEMs.andP;  Often, the libraries areapplication-specific, usually designed for such popular applications asWordPerfect, Microsoft Word, Ventura Publisher, PageMaker and Windows.andP;  Typelibraries may be bundled with font managers and installation programs.andP;  Inaddition, font-editing programs can be used with commercial typefacelibraries to handle special effects and custom fonts.andM;Despite the variety, ''people are not using soft fonts, and that's a majoreducation problem,'' said Parker.andP;  ''The problem with font makers is thattheir business is designing fonts, not marketing them.''andM;Parker applauded such companies as Adobe and Bitstream, which packagelibraries of functionally useful typefaces and attempt to educate users.andM;At The Computer Literacy Workshop, a training firm in Bellaire, Texas, softfonts have spurred the creation of a new training style.andP;  President MargaretLuellen feels that her ''Living with Your Laser'' class picks up where thevendors have fallen short in the font educational process.andM;''The rules for installing and using fonts are different,'' said Luellen,''and that's making people pull their hair out.'' To succeed with fonts, onemust know the precise order in which things should be done, she said.andM;Application vendors don't alleviate the problem, Luellen said.andP;  ''All of theapplication manuals include soft fonts as an appendix in the very back of thevery last manual.andP;  This is a problem, since people want to integrate fontsright away.''andM;Users are confused, Luellen added, because they don't know which point sizesor typefaces to create for daily use or where to store the fonts in asubdirectory system.andM;''I could make a fortune,'' she said, ''if I simply supplied a hard-copysample of what Times Roman 14-point type and all the other fonts and sizeslook like.''andM;Bitstream entices users by offering sample fonts with its font-installationkit.andP;  The Bitstream Starter Kit, which includes the Fontware Installation Kitand several sample fonts, is distributed free with some word-processingprograms.andM;Bitstream's Starter Kit has been criticized for the fact that its inabilityto handle non-Bitstream fonts makes font creation time-consuming and requireshuge amounts of disk storage, as well as a separate Installation Kit for eachapplication.andP;  Bitstream's recently announced Fontware 3.0 addresses theseproblems.andM;According to Domenitz, the kit can simultaneously generate fonts for multipleapplications.andP;  In addition, Fontware 3.0 promises to be faster and lessdemanding in its hard-disk storage requirements.andP;  It also allows forcustomized character sets and includes a specially created ASCII business setthat contains the 96 ASCII characters plus various common symbols.andM;Other font vendors are responding to the need for better font-handling toolsas well.andP;  SoftCraft's Font Solution Pak ($495) contains typefaces, plus anassortment of font-management utilities.andP;  ''You tell the installation programwhich application you are using, and it will create the fonts and installthem for that application,'' said SoftCraft's Fenchel.andM;The program includes Spin Font, a utility that creates curved or rotatedtext, Font Effects, for creating special three-dimensional, striped andshaded fonts, and a Font Editor.andM;Hewlett-Packard and Agfa Compugraphic co-developed Type Director, afont-installation, -generation and -management program that employs AgfaCompugraphic's font-scaling technology.andP;  According to Doug Shaw, sales andmarketing manager at Agfa Compugraphic in Wilmington, Mass., ''Type Directordoes a lot more than just make bitmaps.''andM;Shaw said that Type Director lets users create reduced font sets, freeingthem from having to create an entire font if, for example, they want only aname to appear in a script font.andP;  ''One kit serves all, because the softwareinstalls any PCL-compatible bit-mapped font in a number of differentapplications from a single menu,'' Shaw said.andP;  PCL is the page-descriptionlanguage used in HP's LaserJet printers.andM;''With Bitstream [Fontware] and others that store fonts on a hard disk,you've got to spec your document before you start and know exactly whichtypesizes and styles you'll need,'' said Seth Fox, product manager for SWFTE,a maker of fonts and font technology in Greenville, Del.andM;Fox explained that SWFTE's Glyphix fonts (available for WordPerfect andMicrosoft Word) create on-the-fly font scaling so users need not devotehard-disk resources to font storage.andM;''The cost of soft fonts in a corporate environment can be staggering,'' saidClay Gordon, an associate with InterConsult, a market-research firm inCambridge, Mass.andM;Gordon believes that because soft-font vendors expect one outline font to beused with either one user, one output device or one network, a corporationultimately needs to manage a huge number of printer fonts within a corporateenvironment.andM;''Typically, the corporate user does not need more than one serif face withthree or four fonts [Roman, Bold, Italic or Bold Italic], one sans serif facewith the same fonts, and one decorative face,'' he said.andM;Gordon feels that a corporate standard for choosing and enforcing thedistribution and use of fonts is an element that is missing from theindustry.andM;Gordon is quick to tie fonts into the larger issue of corporate publishing.andO;''By the time you configure a [desktop-publishing] system with extra fonts,memory, clip art and scanners, you have a $10,000 system sitting on the deskthat you'll use about 15 percent of the time.andM;''Fonts [are] one aspect of the myth that [desktop publishing] iscost-effective and that it is cost-effective to distribute basiccommunications functions throughout the organization,'' Gordon said.andM;One ambitious solution to font management is the development of some form ofan intelligent front end that queries the user and suggests documenttemplates.andM;The Font Co., a Boston-based maker of font technology and font libraries forOEMs, is working on such a solution.andP;  ''We are undertaking some extraordinarydevelopment of the software to make these templates,'' said Mike Parker,president of the firm.andP;  ''It would be like asking 21 questions about the wayyou want your document to look.''andM;----------Robin Raskin is a free-lance writer based in New York who writes frequentlyabout computers.andM;In the May 1 Buyers' Guide chart that covered stand-alone Multiuser OperatingSystems for PCs, we inadvertently omitted MUC-DOS from Haar Industries Inc.andO;The company can be contacted at 260 Virginia Ave.andP;
