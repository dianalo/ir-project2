Prices of many of them have outpaced the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index by a considerable margin, and yields have been measured in double digits.    But while there are still some rich opportunities for selective buyers, investment professionals say, the sharp run-up in prices, changes in the nature of the market and emerging problems with some individual partnerships present serious pitfalls for the average investor.    &quot;The MLP market is not the happy hunting ground it was at the end of last year,&quot; says Anne Mengden, senior vice president at Cohen andamp; Steers Capital Management Inc., a New York money-management firm.    Like conventional limited partnerships, master limited partnerships invest in areas as diverse as oil drilling and gas pipelines, restaurants and hotels, shopping centers and cable TV, home builders and mortgage banking -- even the Boston Celtics basketball team is an MLP. Like other partnerships, they typically offer high yields because they can pass income directly to investors without paying corporate income taxes. But unlike other partnerships, master limited partnerships provide liquidity because they trade on exchanges like stocks.    According to the Investment Partnership Association, the average price gain for one group of real estate MLPs in the first nine months of 1988 was almost 26%, nearly three times the 8.63% gain in the Sandamp;P-500 index. Oil and gas MLPs as a group offered yields of 14.65% at the end of September.    But some professional investors cite a growing list of problems with master limited partnerships that they believe now outweigh the opportunities for many small investors. Among their major concerns:   DEARTH OF INFORMATION: Master limited partnerships have never attracted much attention from Wall Street research analysts; last year's tax-law changes made the situation even worse.    While the measure passed by Congress at year-end didn't hit existing master limited partnerships as hard as some had feared, it effectively closed the door on most new partnerships. That is because the new law would subject many types of new offerings to ordinary corporate taxes.    With almost no new-issue activity in sight, Wall Street investment houses have begun to withdraw existing research and marketing support, leaving individual investors more on their own than ever. &quot;There are really no research vehicles to help investors make decisions in this area. They've got to do it themselves,&quot; says Keith Allaire, executive vice president at Robert A. Stanger andamp; Co., a Shrewsbury, N.J., firm that tracks partnerships.    CASH FLOW PROBLEMS: Investment advisers say it is more important than ever to determine if operating cash flow is really enough to cover a master limited partnership's payouts to investors.    Many real estate MLPs, for example, promised payouts that the underlying assets couldn't support. Now, pinched between high debt-servicing requirements and falling occupancy rates, they are having trouble meeting those promises.    &quot;There are a large number of deals out there where operating cash flow doesn't cover current distributions, so there's a real strong possibility they'll have to slash distributions in the next year or two,&quot; says Daniel Lee, an analyst who follows MLPs at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.    La Quinta Motor Inns LP and Aircoa Hotel Partners LP are two MLPs that analysts say will be vulnerable to payout cuts unless cash flow improves dramatically in the next year or so.    DOUBTFUL GUARANTEES: Many master limited partnerships were offered to the public with multiyear guarantees that support payouts to investors if the partnership falters. In some cases, the guarantees and other sweeteners were used to camouflage overvalued offerings.    Now those guarantees are starting to expire, threatening to leave investors in the lurch. &quot;The real economics are starting to show, and they don't look that good in many cases,&quot; says Mr. Lee.    In some cases, existing guarantees already are doubtful because of the sponsor's own financial troubles.    In others, the promised support simply isn't sufficient to offset the shortfall in the MLP's cash flow. That was the case earlier this year with Allstar Inns, a California budget motel chain that exhausted the guarantee package extended by its controlling shareholder and shocked investors with a 25% payout cut just a year after going public.    OTHER STRUCTURAL FLAWS: Douglas Newhouse, president of Middex Capital Corp., estimates that only about a third of existing master limited partnerships were of good quality to begin with. Most of those are concentrated in the real estate and operating business sectors, he says.    One area of which he says investors should be particularly wary is &quot;roll-up&quot; MLPs. These are issues where traditional, nontraded limited partnerships -- often old tax shelters -- have been lumped together, in many cases disguising problems with the underlying partnerships or introducing changes that favor the general partner at the expense of outside investors. &quot;That's a primary bad-deal area,&quot; says Mr. Newhouse.    National Realty L.P., for instance, now trades at about 70% below what its sponsor, Southmark Corp., said was the roll-up's value when it went public a year ago. In the first nine months of this year, it lost 9.7% on a total return basis despite paying a hefty yield of 10.67%, according to Barry Vinocur, publisher of the Real Estate Securities Review, a San Rafael, Calif., newsletter.    In judging the quality of MLPs that aren't roll-ups, adds Mr. Newhouse, investors should be careful about older issues in general. &quot;Buyers got choosier when they'd seen a lot of (MLPs), so the later deals, done between January and June 1987, are typically the better deals.&quot;    Similarly, he says, smaller MLPs that weren't put together by big Wall Street firms raise question marks because &quot;the better deals tended to go to the bigger firms.&quot;    PERSONAL TAX COMPLICATIONS: Even if an investor does find an MLP that is a real value, there are other headaches. Foremost among them is the tax-reporting burden. Because of the way MLPs are structured, investors are usually required to file tax returns in many different states. Aside from the extra inconvenience, each MLP holding can add $100 to $150 to the investor's annual accounting costs, estimates William G. Brennan, a partner with the Washington office of accountants Ernst andamp; Whinney and managing editor of its financial-planning newsletter.    Last year's tax-law changes gave some individuals less incentive to bother with MLPs by reclassifying income from publicly traded partnerships as &quot;portfolio&quot; rather than &quot;passive.&quot; That eliminated an important tax break, because it means MLP earnings can no longer be used to offset so-called passive losses, such as those from old tax shelters.    LIMITED LIQUIDITY: Although it is a lot easier to get out of a master limited partnership than a conventional partnership, investing in an MLP isn't like buying stock in ATandamp;T or GM. Liquidity, which is really nothing more than the ability to buy and sell shares easily, has been limited because institutional participation has been scant.    Since last year's crash, liquidity has plummeted to new lows, creating additional risks for those who get caught with problem issues. Now, says Drexel's Mr. Lee, master limited partnerships &quot;trade almost by appointment.&quot;    Despite all these problems, some professional investors see continued opportunities in the field. &quot;Astute money managers are looking at it, which is a good indication that there are some definite values in that marketplace,&quot; says Stanger's Mr. Allaire. Investment advisers who say they're selective buyers today include Cohen andamp; Steers's Ms. Mengden and Robert Haber, who manages Fidelity Investments' Balanced Fund and Fidelity Plymouth Income and Growth Fund.    ---              Performance of Selected MLP Groups                           PRICE CHANGE                             12/24/87-      AVERAGE YIELD GROUP                       9/30/88     9/30/88    12/24/87 Real Estate/Asset  (Shopping centers,   commercial real   estate leasing,   farm land, etc.)          25.93%       12.13%     13.26% Real Estate/Operating  (Home builders, hotel   and restaurant   franchise operators,   etc.)                     15.96        12.82      15.63 Oil and Gas                  0.79        14.65      15.23 Miscellaneous/Operating  (Cable TV, equipment   leasing, film, service   companies, etc.)          18.66         9.78      12.06 Standard andamp; Poor's  500-Stock index             8.63%        3.69%      3.66%    Porter Wheeler, Investment Partnership Association</TEXT></DOC>
