At least 22 traffic deaths were blamed on the storm, although noone was injured when wind gusting to 50 mph tore down 15 stories ofmetal construction scaffolding around a building in White Plains,N.Y., on Friday.   The storm, which had gained strength as it moved northward fromTexas through the Great Lakes region earlier in the week, left 12to 25 inches of snow from eastern New York across much of Vermontand New Hampshire to southern Maine on Friday, the National WeatherService said.   ``It's one of the biggest ones of the year. New York andVermont, they get these things one every year or two,'' said LyleAlexander of the National Severe Storms Forecast Center.   Storm warnings for northern Maine and Vermont were still ineffect this morning as the storm headed into Canada, Alexander said.   ``It's terrible out there,'' New Hampshire state policedispatcher Norman St. Hilaire, said Friday, reporting numerousvehicles sliding off highways.   Ironically, across the continent in Calgary, Alberta, white sandwas trucked in to fill in melting patches on the field used fortoday's opening ceremonies of the Winter Olympics. It hasn't snowedthere for a week.   Snow accumulations included 25 inches in Crawford Notch, N.H.,23 in Lebanon, over two feet in Brattleboro, Vt., 14 inches in theBerkshires of eastern Massachusetts and more than 13 inches inJewett, N.Y.   In the South, up to 3 inches of snow, freezing rain and sleetleft roads extremely slippery across northern sections ofMississippi and Alabama, and into parts of Tennessee and Kentucky,and many vehicles slid into ditches.   A foot of snow and wind gusting to 60 mph immobilized much ofNew Hampshire's presidential campaign, holing up Vice PresidentBush in his hotel and forcing Democratic hopeful Paul Simon tocancel his morning schedule.   Bob Dole and Pat Robertson couldn't get out of the state forappearances elsewhere, while Jesse Jackson and Al Gore, inVirginia, and Jack Kemp, in Washington, couldn't get into the state.   Only Richard Gephardt had a campaign event made to order forsuch a day _ watching a dog sled race in Laconia.   Boston's Logan International Airport closed for about six hoursbecause of poor visibility in blowing snow and hundreds oftravelers camped out in waiting lounges.   Connecticut's Bradley International Airport closed for more thantwo hours while 8 inches of snow was removed. USAir canceledflights into Albany, N.Y., during the morning.   Almost all New Hampshire legislative hearings were canceled, andstate offices closed at noon, and blowing snow led some towns toclose municipal offices in northwestern Massachusetts.   Ski operators, however, were ecstatic over the storm, whicharrived in time for the presidents' day holiday weekend andValentine's Day on Sunday.   ``It couldn't have come at a better time,'' said Chris Conti,office manager with the Vermont Ski Areas Association in Montpelier.   Schools were closed because of snow or icy roads Friday in partsof Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, Massachusetts, Maine, Michigan,New York, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Ohio.   Cold air pushed southward in the storm's wake and Friday morningtemperatures were only in the teens in the South. Record lowsincluded 11 at El Dorado, Ark.; 2 at Paducah, Ky., 27 below zero atSt. Cloud, Minn., and 32 below zero at Duluth, Minn.   Traffic deaths attributed to the weather included five inArkansas, four in Texas, three in Tennessee and Indiana, two eachin New York and Vermont, and one each in Michigan, Maryland andKentucky.</TEXT></DOC>
