The budget-cutting proposals, which still must be approvedby Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and President Bush, areabout twice as large as reductions envisioned in themilitary's current five-year plan through 1995. Mr. Cheney islikely to use the recommendations in preparing a long-termspending blueprint, which would seek to protect high-techweaponry at the expense of personnel and existing hardware,according to these aides.</LP><TEXT>   But Congress probably will demand significantly faster anddeeper cuts in military programs, especially from the Army,which under the latest proposals maintains its roughlyone-third share of the Pentagon's overall budget through thelate 1990s.   Under proposals submitted by Army leaders to SecretaryCheney, total active-duty strength would fall to about580,000 soldiers over the next eight years from the current764,000. This would amount to a one-quarter reduction of Armyforces world-wide, according to people familiar with thedetails, which were first reported by the Associated Press.Over the same period, the size of the National Guard and Armyreserve forces is slated to fall to 645,000 from 776,000.   By agreeing to slash personnel, Army leaders are bettingthey can stave off deep reductions in maintenance andtraining accounts for the remaining troops. They alsoapparently hope to save their most cherished acquisitionprograms, including plans to spend about $40 billion topurchase a new generation of light attack helicopters anduntold billions of dollars to develop and field replacementsfor the heavy Abrams tanks and several armored vehicles.   Gen. Carl Vuono, the Army's chief of staff, has toldlawmakers that without the new helicopters, the Army &quot;isgoing to go into the 21st century with 30-year-oldtechnology.&quot; The light scout helicopter, facing increasingcriticism on Capitol Hill, is being developed by twocompeting teams of contractors: McDonnell Douglas Corp. and aTextron Inc. unit are pitted against Boeing Co. and a unit ofUnited Technologies Corp.   At the same time, however, Gen. Vuono and other topPentagon officials are strongly resisting congressionaldemands for faster withdrawals of U.S. troops from WestGermany prior to completion of U.S.-Soviet arms-controltalks. Among other things, Mr. Cheney still has to decide howlarge a portion of the contemplated active-duty cuts willcome from Europe over the long run and whether reserve forcesshould face proportionately smaller cuts as Gen. Vuono andArmy Secretary Michael Stone advocate.   For the Air Force, Mr. Cheney is putting the finishingtouches on plans reducing the number of fighter wings to 28from the current 35, according to congressional and Pentagonaides. A tactical fighter wing has as many as 72 aircraft,and such cuts would require phasing out well over 300high-performance aircraft from active duty by the late 1990s.Previous plans announced by the Pentagon talked abouteliminating a maximum of five such frontline Air Force unitsby the mid-1990s.   To try to save its multibillion-dollar plans to purchasefleets of radar-evading B-2 Stealth bombers, new Stealthfighters and C-17 transport planes, the Air Force isconsidering cutting another 45,000 uniformed personnel by thelate 1990s, according to Pentagon and congressional budgetanalysts.   Moreover, Air Force Secretary Donald Rice is leaningtoward putting some of the service's most trusted hardware onthe chopping block, including reducing F-16 production andpossibly phasing out all purchases after 1998 of the fighterbuilt by General Dynamics Corp.   Taken all together, the spending proposals being reviewedby Secretary Cheney make up the most far-reaching package ofpersonnel and acquisition cuts prepared by high-levelPentagon planners since Communist governments in EasternEurope began toppling last fall.   The Navy, which has been fighting hard to keep the budgetknife from its 14 aircraft carriers, is expected to facesmaller proposed percentage reductions in personnel andshipbuilding accounts than the other services. But Mr. Cheneyhas ordered a review of Trident submarine production and hashinted that as many as 50 older Navy surface ships andsubmarines may be retired from the fleet during the next sixor seven years.</TEXT></DOC>
