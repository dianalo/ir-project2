As he boarded a ferry Tuesday morning for a second day ofprivate talks on Governors Island in New York's harbor, Neil vanHeerden, the head of the South African delegation, was asked aboutthe progress of the meetings.   He replied they had developed ``further than Cairo and London,''the sites of the previous four-party discussions.   South Africa has said it would accept a U.N. Security Councilresolution calling Namibia's independence under black majority ruleonce the estimated 50,000 Cuban troops pull out. Cuban troops arefighting alongside Angolan government forces against U.S.-backedanti-communist rebels.   The head of the Angolan delegation, Gen. Antonio dos SantosFranca, said of Monday's talks: ``It went well.'' He made the briefcomment while returning to his hotel.   A news conference is expected Wednesday, according to officialsinvolved in the talks.   The four parties first met in London in early May and thenreconvened late last month in Cairo, Egypt. South African andAngolan officials held a separate meeting in May in Brazzaville,Congo.   The timetable for the withdrawal of the Cubans is probably themost difficult unresolved issue, U.S. officials have said, speakingon condition of anonymity.   The U.S. goal is a full Cuban troop withdrawal in one year, thesame time span that the U.N. resolution sets for grantingindependence to Namibia, also called South-West Africa.   Angola and Cuba have insisted that the Cuban withdrawal shouldtake place over four years, but the U.S. officials believe that isan opening bargaining position that is subject to change as peacetalks proceed.   Angola has been convulsed by civil war since it gainedindependence from Portugal in 1975.   South Africa has repeatedly sent troops across the border fromNamibia into Angola to support the rebel forces known as UNITA, orNational Union for the Total Independence of Angola, in theirclashes with Cuban and Angolan forces.</TEXT></DOC>
