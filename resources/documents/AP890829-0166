(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A communications satellite that wasthe first payload put in orbit by a privately owned rocket wasparked in a permanent orbit Tuesday by a radio-controlled motoraboard the satellite.   The 2,700-pound Marcopolo I, which will beam televison programsto British homes, was launched into a preliminary elliptical orbitSunday from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station atop a three-stageDelta rocket made by McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Co.   Ground controllers tracked the satellite for nearly two days todetermine its orbital path, then sent a radio signal at 9:52 a.m.EDT to fire the motor.   Hughes Aircraft Co., which built the satellite for a Britishbroadcasting company, said the motor fired perfectly to kick thespacecraft into a circular orbit 22,300 miles above the AtlanticOcean, overlooking the British Isles.   ``Everything is checking out very well. All the systems areoperating the way they should be,'' said Hughes spokesman RichardDore. ``This has been a very smooth transition into space.''   The satellite's antenna and solar panels, which provide power,are expected to be deployed Thursday, Dore said.   After being checked for several months, Marcopolo I will beginbeaming television signals to Britain next spring, said AnthonySimonds-Gooding, chief executive officer of British SatelliteBroadcasting Ltd., which will operate the system.   Marcopolo I is the first of two satellites designed to transmittelevision programs for a fraction of the cost of cable systemsdirectly to British homes equipped with a 12-inch dish antenna, abox on top of the TV set and a remote control unit.   The second satellite is scheduled for launch in mid-1990.   The launch was a milestone in the U.S. commercial space programstarted after the 1986 Challenger explosion.   President Reagan ordered the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration to stop launching payloads for commercial customersfrom the space shuttle, and said the job should be done by privateindustry using unmanned rockets.</TEXT></DOC>
