The suspect, known only as Bella, glaresback through smoldering black eyes. Bella doesn't have a rapsheet, but Mr. Eachus knows this isn't her first offense.&quot;Just look at those scars,&quot; he says, pointing at raw marksacross Bella's powerful shoulders. &quot;No question this one'sbeen in a scrap before.&quot;   Mr. Eachus will tell this to the judge as evidence thatBella, an American pit bull terrier, shouldn't have beenallowed to roam uncontrolled. Bella's handler could be finedmore than $3,000 or imprisoned for up to six months. Bella,who ripped open a dachshund's throat and bit its owner'shand, will pay the ultimate price. &quot;See ya in doggy heaven,&quot;says Mr. Eachus, watching Bella gnaw at the bars of her cage.Asked if there's anything a pit bull such as Bella won'tbite, Mr. Eachus responds, &quot;A 747 jetliner -- flight.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   England is renowned as a nation of dog lovers, a landwhere corgis trail Queen Elizabeth II and where shoppers parktheir poodles in a carpeted kennel at Harrods departmentstore. Queen Victoria even shared her deathbed with aPomeranian. But England's long affair with dogs has soured.Aggressive breeds such as pit bulls and Rottweilers aresuddenly in vogue, and as their numbers have risen, so havereports of dog attacks. The result is public panic,Parliamentary debate and press headlines suggestive of &quot;TheHound of the Baskervilles&quot;:   &quot;Devil Dog Scars Tot&quot;   &quot;Girl, 8, Scalped in Dog Horror.&quot;   England isn't the first country to do battle withdangerous dogs, but it may be unique in the lethal force itis deploying. Some animal wardens are arming themselves withriot shields, chain mail, and ultrasonic stun guns. &quot;Heroesget bit,&quot; explains Mr. Eachus, an inspector with the RoyalSociety for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA),which is often called to handle vicious dogs. In a countrywhere gun control is so strict that most police go unarmed,Mr. Eachus is licensed to pack a .32 automatic pistol in hisvan.   &quot;We need that kind of weaponry to control humans, notdogs,&quot; Micky Niego, an official with the American Society forthe Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, says of the variedEnglish arsenal. Some U.S. wardens carry tranquilizing dartsand Mace, but most prefer nets and rods with loops.   The English say their situation demands special tactics.Unlike the U.S., where rabies has led to tight animalcontrol, England is free of the disease and has no doglicensing, no leash law and, in many areas, no dog wardens.England's pet-obsessed public also can be feral in defendinganimal rights. &quot;The English worry more about the welfare ofpoor little pooch than they do about the safety of JoePublic,&quot; says Mr. Eachus, an American who has been living inEngland since 1977.   The English also resist the notion that some breeds may betough to tame. &quot;People think a little loving care will turnpit bulls into nice pets,&quot; says Roger Mugford, an animalpsychologist in London. &quot;They're wrong.&quot; Mr. Mugford echoesthe view of many English experts in describing the dogs asfearless, almost immune to pain, &quot;and able to turn fromplayful jokers into psychopathic killers without a moment'swarning.&quot;   Some dog warriors are taking no chances. Standing besideher van in the north England city of Bradford, Pat Harwooddons the latest in canine battle dress. Long blond curlsvanish beneath a visored helmet designed for riot control bythe North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Hands slip intoelbow-length gloves. She cradles a reinforced plastic&quot;Armadillo Tactical Riot Shield,&quot; used by police to repelmissiles. Her tall frame is enveloped by a zip-up jump suit,lined with chain mesh and heavily padded.   &quot;I feel like I'm inside a Brillo Pad,&quot; says the warden,her voice muffled by the helmet's visor. Ms. Harwood uses thesuit only for emergencies, but she never patrols without her&quot;Dazer,&quot; a pocket-sized weapon designed to startle dogs witha high-frequency squeal. &quot;It's important to intimidate,&quot; saysher boss, senior warden Terry Singh.   Some say such gladiators are barking up the wrong tree.&quot;If you approach a pit bull looking like a creature fromMars, he's more likely to go berserk and bite you,&quot; saysKevin McNicholas, a veteran London dog warden.   Answering a call on his van's radio phone, Mr. McNicholasraces to a suburban home whose residents are alarmed by agnashing sound from an adjoining yard. He finds a huge Germanshepherd ripping apart the fence between the two yards withits fangs. When the dog bounds toward him, Mr. McNicholaskneels, clicks his tongue and slips a rope around the dog'sneck. &quot;It doesn't need to be Waterloo every time you take adog in,&quot; he says, calmly guiding the animal into his van.   On another call, an anxious woman points into herneighbor's yard, where two dummies hang from trees, theirpants legs in shreds. The woman says her neighbors oftenstand in the yard shouting &quot;Kill]&quot; as two pit bulls tear theeffigies apart. Mr. McNicholas's advice: If the dogs comeclose, stand perfectly still, avoid eye contact, and, ifpossible, whimper like a puppy. &quot;Dog biscuits also help,&quot; hesays. The most lethal weapon he has ever employed is a fireextinguisher. In eight years of service, he hasn't beenbitten.   Many other officials haven't been so lucky. There were7,717 dog attacks on mailmen last year; dozens of police wereinjured. London police also are receiving twice as many callsabout dangerous dogs as they did just six months ago. Whilefatal attacks remain rare (one or two a year compared to anaverage of 15 in the U.S.), there now are an estimated500,000 strays on English streets and crowded dog pounds withcages marked &quot;Mad] Take Care]&quot;   Despite strong lobbying by police, postmen, the RSPCA andother groups, Parliament narrowly rejected a dog registrationlaw in May. But the government now is considering banningsome breeds, or requiring that such dogs be muzzled inpublic. &quot;It sounds like hysteria until a Rottweiler chewsyour kid to pieces,&quot; says Bill Wadman-Taylor, a veterinarianand head of the Battersea Dogs Home in London.   Bill Edmond, head of Britain's Kennel Club, says the RSPCAand other groups are overreacting. &quot;The problem is people,not dogs,&quot; he says. &quot;Irresponsible owners can make any dogvicious.&quot; His organization opposes dog licensing and otherrestrictions &quot;because the people who are neglecting theirdogs, or training them to attack, are the very same peoplewho won't comply with the licensing law.&quot;   The RSPCA's Mr. Eachus doesn't hesitate to get tough withboth mad dogs and Englishmen. The chain-smoking inspector hasshot two dogs to death and donned riot gear to take in manyothers. In his van, he carries a forensic kit containing amagnifying glass, camera and tweezers to collect evidencesuch as dried blood and dogs' hair for use in prosecutingowners.   &quot;There's no room for amateurism here,&quot; says the veteranenforcer. He can quote chapter and verse from English doglaw, such as the 1847 statute citing owners for &quot;suffering tobe at large a ferocious unmuzzled dog,&quot; and more recent lawsregarding the fouling of sidewalks with what someeuphemistically call &quot;dog-logs.&quot;   Mr. Eachus predicts that the craze for pit bulls and othermacho dogs will peak in a few years, as it has in the U.S. Inthe meantime, though, &quot;we need to get dangerous dogs off thestreet and their owners behind bars,&quot; he says.   Officials fear, however, that another creature may soonterrorize England. The RSPCA recently received a panickedphone call reporting that a wild boar was running amok in aLondon street. It turned out to be a Vietnamese pot-belliedpig, a faddish pet in America that is just now reachingEnglish shores.</TEXT></DOC>
