In its July crop-production report, the department estimated that corn will be harvested on 59.6 million acres, or 14% fewer than in 1986. Soybean acreage harvested is expected to fall 3% to 57.6 million.    Both figures show the effects of U.S. farm programs. High target prices for corn have prompted many farmers to plant corn instead of soybeans. But the estimate for corn also fell, as the effect of the target prices was more than offset by corn acreage-reduction programs.    Some analysts say the reduced acreage could lead to higher prices for soybeans next year, particularly if the Agriculture Department continues its rapid selling of soybean stocks. However, actual yields of both crops remain strong, despite the decline in acreage.    The winter wheat crop is expected to be 1.57 billion bushels, or 4% more than a year earlier, the department said.    In a separate report, the department estimated the Soviet grain crop at 195 million tons this year, about the same as it estimated a month ago. The total comprises 75.5 million tons of wheat, 105.5 million tons of coarse grains and 14 million tons of miscellaneous grains. The estimate of the total grain area planted by the Soviets also is unchanged at 115 million hectares, or about 284 million acres.    The department also said its global supply and demand projections for wheat are little changed from a month ago. Prospective demand continues to be strong, it said, with some increase in U.S. exports likely. </TEXT></DOC>
