A year earlier, the publishing, insurance and theme park concern had net income of $10.9 million, or 31 cents a share. Revenue rose 31% to $408.7 million from $312 million.    For the six months, Harcourt had a loss of $98.5 million, compared with a year-earlier profit of $3.5 million, or 10 cents a share. Revenue rose 35% to $740 million from $547 million. Harcourt also had a pretax charge of $15.2 million in the first quarter related to the relocation of its insurance operations.    The quarter's loss, while expected, nonetheless shows the steep price Harcourt is paying for the independence it won from a $1.73 billion takeover bid in May by British Printing andamp; Communication Corp., which is controlled by Robert Maxwell. The quarter's figures include a $98.9 million charge connected with the $3 billion recapitalization Harcourt undertook to escape Mr. Maxwell. The quarter also includes a separate $11.2 million after-tax charge related to the repurchase of debt.    As previously reported, the restructuring nearly tripled Harcourt's debt to more than $2.5 billion and has left it highly vulnerable to economic downturns or interest rate increases. The plan has withstood several court challenges by angry investors, although some litigation is still pending.    The results also raise questions about whether Harcourt can generate the ambitious growth it has said will be needed to meet payments on the huge debt. When it unveiled the plan, Harcourt estimated it would have net income, before preferred dividends, of $23 million in 1987 and $33 million in 1988. In 1986 Harcourt earned $70.5 million, or $1.91 a share. It also projected that revenue would mushroom to $2.2 billion by 1989, more than double 1986's revenue of $968.6 million. That would require far greater revenue growth than the annual 12% increases Harcourt has managed over the past five years.    Harcourt officials didn't return phone calls seeking comment. The company has emphasized in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that most of its operating earnings and revenue come in the third quarter of the year.    The results were announced after the market closed Friday. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Harcourt's stock closed at $10.25 a share, unchanged. </TEXT></DOC>
