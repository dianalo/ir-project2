Industry sources said yesterday that the U.S. oil companies operating in Saudi Arabia will be compensated in one way or another if world prices decline, even as OPEC's base price remains fixed at $18 a barrel. An increase in demand for Saudi oil as a result of this reported policy has caused the kingdom's production to rebound in recent weeks after slumping severely for a few days in September. The increased Saudi production, in turn, is helping cause overall OPEC output to increase, although total production by the 13 member nations remains below a peak level reached in August.    World oil markets were shaken last week by reports that the kingdom was planning some spot-related pricing for Exxon Corp., Texaco Inc., Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp., the companies that operate Arabian American Oil Co. But Saudi Arabia, as previously reported, vigorously denied it had any plans to discount its oil price or to link prices to the cost of other freely priced oil, such as North Sea Brent, Alaskan North Slope or a Dubai crude.    Nonetheless, industry sources said yesterday, a form of rebate for the Aramco companies still is in the works if world oil prices fall. Although the Aramco companies would continue to pay the official price for all Saudi oil, they would later be &quot;made economically whole&quot; through an increase of their operating, or service, fees, the sources said.    The four U.S. oil companies have received an operating fee for continuing to run the Saudi-American consortium since Saudi Arabia took over full ownership of Aramco in the 1970s. In effect a routine discount, the fee has been adjusted over the years. It is understood to total 26 cents a barrel today, applying only to oil purchased by each of the four companies from Saudi Arabia.    Saudi Arabia, industry sources said, would use the fee as a mechanism to compensate the Aramco companies if a spot market-related pricing formula called for such an adjustment. The arrangement would be temporary, however, and would be targeted at maintaining Saudi Arabian oil production at the kingdom's full OPEC quota of 4.3 million barrels a day.    How much of an increase in the fee may have been discussed with the Aramco companies isn't known. Neither Aramco nor the four U.S. oil companies -- sworn to secrecy by Saudi officials in the matter -- will discuss any aspect or even confirm that the service fee exists.    But it is understood that the fee could be increased to 40 cents a barrel, or go even higher, if spot prices of the barometer crudes indicated such a pricing accommodation for the Aramco companies. One report yesterday placed the possible limit on the fee as high as 70 cents a barrel.    For whatever reason, the Aramco companies' purchases this month from Saudi Arabia are exceeding their contracted level of 1.3 million barrels a day by more than 200,000 barrels. As a result, total Saudi production is holding at, or remains even above, the kingdom's OPEC quota. Meanwhile, according to industry estimates, total OPEC production has rebounded to more than 19 million barrels a day after dropping to as low as 18 million barrels a day in September. </TEXT></DOC>
