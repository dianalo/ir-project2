Field of the Invention </PAR><PAR>  The present invention relates to a pulsed light source utilizing a laser      diode for generating a short pulsed light of a high repetitive frequency      (200 to 2 picosecond pulse width, for example), and more specifically to a      low noise pulsed light source capable of generating an optical pulse with      reduced light intensity noise and to a voltage detector device utilizing      the same low noise pulsed light source. </PAR><PAR>  2. Description of the Prior Art </PAR><PAR>  An emitted light from a laser diode (LD) changes in its wavelength and      intensity as an excitation current and ambient temperature vary. The      intensity of the emitted light also changes owing to the competition among      longitudinal modes and owing to mode hopping. For a method of reducing      such variations of the light intensity, there is known a technique wherein      a photodetector element such as a photodiode (PD) detects part of the      emitted light from a laser diode to estimate an error signal between a      detected light intensity level and a preset one which is in turn fed back      to an excitation current source which is to drive the laser diode. Such a      technique has already been used for an optical pick-up of a compact disk      (CD) player and so on. </PAR><PAR>  However, all prior practice to reduce the variations of the light intensity      was applied to a laser diode for emitting continuous wave (CW) light or      direct current (DC) light. No investigation was paid up to now to the      noise involved in the intensity of such pulsed light when it is generated      as well as no trial to stabilize the pulsed light intensity. </PAR><PAR>  On the other hand, there are many application fields in need of short      pulsed light because of temporal resolution being specified by the width      of pulsed light. Those fields include an electro optic sampling technique      as disclosed in IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics, Vol. QE-22, No. 1,      January 1986, PP 69 through 78 in which an ultrashort optical pulse is      used as a sampling gate to nondestructively measure an electric signal      with use of an electro-optic (E-O) effect; a fluorescence life measuring      technique as disclosed in Rev. Sci. Instrum. 59 (4), April 1988, PP 663      through 665 in which an ultrashort optical pulse is used to measure laser      excited fluorescence; estimation of response characteristics of      photoelectric detectors and optical integrated circuits (OE IC), etc.;      time correlated photon counting using a photomultiplier, and so on, for      example. A dye laser which generates a picosecond to femtosecond width      pulsed light is usable for such applications from the viewpoint of      temporal resolution but with a difficulty of its being large-sized.      Instead of this, laser diodes are hopeful as pulsed light sources, because      they have some advantages of their being simple and small-sized      instructure, inexpensive in manufacture. </PAR><PAR>  Now, laser diodes can generate a short pulsed light with an about 200 to 20      picosecond width, and with about 670 nm to 1.5 .mu.m wavelengths in      typical, the latter emission wavelengths being varied depending upon the      kinds thereof. Additionally, a second harmonic of the pulsed light from a      laser diode is available to assure a short wavelength pulsed light up to      340 nm. Repetitive frequencies of such optical pulses generally range from      0.1 to 200 MHz although being different in accordance with applications.      Furthermore, there are technically available GHz high repetition pulsed      light and inversely about several hundred Hz pulsed light. </PAR><PAR>  The present inventors have however experimentally found that use of such a      high repetition optical pulse to measurements causes intensity      fluctuations of the light pulse to restrict the lower limit of a      measurement range, as described below. For simplicity, there will be      described a measurement of transmittance of a pulsed light through a      sample 10 with use of a device illustrated in FIG. 8. In FIG. 8, a laser      diode 12A (refer to FIG. 9) incorporated in a laser diode (LD) pulsed      light source 12 emits the optical pulse which is controlled in its      repetitive frequency by an oscillator 14 (repetitive frequency 100 MHz,      pulse width 50 picosecond, and wavelength 830 nm, for example). The LD      pulsed light source 12 is constructed as illustrated in FIG. 9, for      example, to which a bias current has previously been supplied and on which      a negative pulse is applied from an electric pulse generator 12B (Hewlett      Packard, 33002A Comb-Generator (registered trademark) for example) using a      step recovery diode for example to drive the LD 12A. </PAR><PAR>  The pulsed light emitted from the laser diode (LD) 12A impinges upon the      sample 10 through a chopper 16 (chopping frequency 1 kHz, for example)      driven by the oscillator 15 and is partly absorbed by and partly      transmitted through the same as an output light. The output light is      focused by a lens 18 and detected by a photodetector 20 composed of a      photodiode (PD) for example. An output signal from the photodetector 20 is      amplified by a low noise amplifier 22 and lock-in detected by a lock-in      amplifier 24. A chopper signal generated by the oscillator 15 is used for      a reference signal in the lock-in amplifier 24. Herein, noises produced in      the photodetector 20 and in the low noise amplifier 22 have sufficiently      been more reduced than that involved in the transmitted light. </PAR><PAR>  An output from the lock-in amplifier 24 is fed to an output meter 26 for      example and displayed with respect to the transmittance of the foregoing      output light. </PAR><PAR>  Herein, although in the foregoing device of FIG. 8 was made of the chopper      16 and of the lock-in amplifier 24 for lock-in detection for the purpose      of the reduction of measurement noises and the improvement of measurement      accuracy, such construction is unnecessary in simple measurements, in      other words, an output from the photodetector 20 may be amplified and read      in a direct manner. Further, the low noise amplifier 22 may be omitted and      the lock-in amplifier 24 may instead be employed. </PAR><PAR>  In such a device, in case where the transmittance of the pulsed light      through the sample 10 is nonlinear with respect to the incident pulsed      light, the incident pulsed light must be measured up to a sufficiently low      level of the intensity thereof. Thereupon, a difficulty is produced of      noise involved in the pulsed light emitted from a pulsed oscillation LD,      which limits the lower boundary of the measurement. </PAR><PAR>  Referring to FIG. 10, exemplary noise characteristics of the LD pulsed      light obtained experimentally by the present inventors are illustrated,      with the horizontal axis taking frequencies and the vertical axis      effective values (rms) of photoelectric current noise in decibel (dB). The      point 0 dB on the vertical axis indicates a short noise level defined by      the square root of the number of photons involved in the optical pulse      (theoretical limit). FIG. 10 therefore indicates a noise level of the LD      pulsed light normalized by the shot noise level. FIG. 10 further      illustrates a noise level with the prior system as indicated by a solid      line A and marks X. It is understood from the figure that the noise level      when the LD undergoes pulsed oscillation is greater 10 times (20 dB) or      more than the shot noise level, so that the former may be reduced to the      latter shot noise level. </PAR><PAR>  The data illustrated in FIG. 10 is given by measuring involved noise      produced when the LD 12A to be measured is driven by a driving circuit 30      constructed as illustrated in FIG. 9 using a noise fraction measuring      device composed of the photodetector 20, low noise amplifier 22, lock-in      amplifier 24, an oscillator (OSC) 32 for frequency sweep, a noise      detection circuit 34, and a display 36. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  In view of the drawbacks with the prior art, it is an object of

Hereby, the intensity of the LD pulsed      light is automatically controlled to remain unchanged, and any noise      involved in the LD light is also reduced as indicated by the broken line B      and the marks .DELTA. in FIG. 9. </PAR><PAR>  The foregoing stabilized current modulator circuit 44 is to compare the      output from the optical detector 42 and a level signal, and includes, as      shown in FIG. 2, a light intensity signal comparator circuit 44A for      making constant a DC component such as a temperature change and temporal      drift etc., involved in the light intensity, a light intensity noise      extraction circuit 44B for extracting light intensity noise from an output      signal of the optical detector 42 to stabilize an AC component such as a      ripple that changes at light speed, and a stabilized current modulator      circuit 44C for modulating a current on the basis of output signals from      the light intensity signal comparator circuit 44A and the light intensity      noise extraction circuit 44B. </PAR><PAR>  Herein, although in the basic construction illustrated in FIG. 1 the bias      current supplied to the LD 38 was modulated by the stabilized current      modulator circuit 44 over a wide frequency range in accordance with an      output signal from the photodetector 42, the construction to make constant      the intensity of the LD pulsed light is not limited thereto. For example,      the electric pulse generator 40 may be replaced by the photodetector 42      and a stabilized electric pulse generator 41 as illustrated in FIG. 5, and      the amplitude of a pulse signal generated by the stabilized electric pulse      generator 41 may be modulates in accordance with an output signal from the      photodetector 42. Additionally, both may be combined such that the bias      current is modulated by the stabilized current modulator circuit 44 in a      frequency region below a predetermined frequency while the amplitude of a      pulse signal generated by the stabilized electric pulse generator 41 is      modulated in a frequency range above the predetermined frequency. </PAR><PAR>  With such construction, it is possible to stabilize the intensity of high      repetition pulsed light and reduce the light intensity noise. An optical      pulse generated by such the above LD is therefore usable for varieties of      measuring fields such for example as E-O sampling, fluorescence lifetime      measurement, estimation of response characteristics of photoelectric      detector, OE ICs and the like, and temporal correlation photon counting.      The above optical pulse improves the accuracy of those measurements and of      the extension of the lower limits of the measurements, especially, is much      effective by applying to a voltage detector. </PAR><PAR>  In accordance with the invention as set forth in claims 8 through 10, there      is provided the second electrooptic material, additionally to the first      electrooptic material influenced by the voltage of a predetermined portion      of an object to be measured, e.g., an integrated circuit, the second      electrooptic material being disposed to compensate a phase difference      caused by spontaneous double refraction of the first electrooptic      material. With such arrangement, once a light with a given polarization      component enters the second electrooptic material, for example, the      polarization state of the light is changed through the second electrooptic      material owing to the phase difference by the spontaneous double      refraction. Then, as the same light enters the first electrooptic      material, the polarization state of the light is changed through the first      electrooptic material oppositely to the case of the second electrooptic      material owing to the phase difference by the spontaneous double      refraction of the first electrooptic material, and further changed owing      to the voltage of the predetermined portion of the object. Hereby, the      changes in the polarization states caused by the phase differences of the      spontaneous double refraction of the first and second electrooptic      materials are cancelled each other, resulting in the polarization state of      the incident light being changed only by the voltage of the predetermined      portion of the object. </PAR><PAR>  In the invention as set forth in claims 11 and 12, the first transparent      electrode is interposed between the first and second electrooptic      materials and is kept at earth potential for example. A second transparent      electrode is disposed on the side of the second electrooptic material      located oppositely to the side where the first transparent electrode of      the second electrooptic material has been provided, to which electrode      predetermined variable voltage for example is applied. With such      arrangement, the second electrooptic material compensates the influence of      the phase change of the incident light due to the spontaneous double      refraction in the first electrooptic material at all times.      Simultaneously, a DC component of the polarization state of the exit light      from the first electrooptic material is eliminated by applying voltage to      the second transparent electrode, and further the polarization state of      the exit light from which the DC component has been eliminated, is      compensated so as not to vary owing to a temperature change by making      variable the voltage applied to the second transparent electrode following      the temperature change. </PAR><PAR>  In the invention as set forth in claims 13 and 14, there is provided      reflecting means such as a metal thin film, a dielectric multi-layer film      mirror, and the like for example on the tip end of the electrooptic      material, while there is provided the transparent electrode oppositely to      the electrooptic material to the side of the same where said reflecting      means has been provided. Provided that the surface of the transparent      electrode is set to be perpendicular to the central axis of the optical      probe for example and that the transparent electrode is kept at earth      potential for example, and electric line of force produced by the voltage      of the predetermined portion of the object is brought into a parallel one      in the electrooptic material with respect to the central axis of the      optical probe. Hereby, the change in the refractive index of the      electrooptic material is made uniform over the whole electrooptic      material, so that the polarization state of the optical beam can be      changed accurately corresponding to the voltage of the predetermined      portion of the object. </PAR><PAR>  In the invention as set forth in claim 15, the electrooptic material is      positioned so as to cover a plurality of measurement positions on an      object from which voltages are to be detected, and an optical beam is      directed to enter respective portions of the electrooptic material      corresponding to the plurality of the measurement positions of the object      for scanning over these respective portions. For the scanning, the optical      beam may be deflected with the aid of a movable mirror, an acoustooptic      deflector, and the like for example, or it may be realized by moving the      electrooptic material and the object. On the basis of changes in the      polarization states of exit lights from the respective portions of the      electrooptic material due to such scanning, voltages at the plurality of      the measurement positions of the object can be detected with good      operatability. </PAR><PAR>  In the invention as set forth in claim 16, the electrooptic material is      positioned so as to cover a plurality of positions of an object, form      which voltages are to be detected, and an optical beam from a light source      is divided into many desired patterns by a microlens array, a holographic      lens, or a spatial light modulator and directed to enter particular      portions of the electrooptic material corresponding to the particular      positions of the object. Refractive indexes of the respective portions of      the electrooptic material are changed by the voltage at the respective      positions of the object corresponding to the respective portions of the      electrooptic material, so that the optical beam divided into many desired      patterns and directed to enter the respective particular portions of the      electrooptic material is changed in polarization states in conformity with      the changes in the refractive indexes at the respective particular      portions of the electrooptic material and emanating from the electrooptic      material as an exit light to enter a detector, say, a two-dimensional      photodetector array or a streak camera. Hereby, the detector can detect      the voltages at particular positions of the object, for example, the      particular two-dimensional positions, simultaneously. </PAR><PAR>  In the invention as set forth in claim 18, the electrooptic material is      positioned so as to cover a plurality of two-dimensional positions of an      object, from which voltages are to be detected, and an optical beam from      the light source is directed to enter respective two-dimensional portions      of the electrooptic material corresponding to the plurality of the      two-dimensional positions of the object. Refractive indexes of the      respective two-dimensional portions of the electrooptic material are      changed owing the voltages at the respective two-dimensional positions of      the object corresponding to the respective two-dimensional portions of the      electrooptic material, so that the optical beam incident upon the      respective two-dimensional portions of the electrooptic material is      changed in its polarization states following the changes in the refractive      indexes of the respective two-dimensional portions of the electrooptic      material, emanating as exit light from the electrooptic material and      directed to enter a detector, say, a two-dimensional photodetector array      or a streak camera. Hereby, the detector can detect the voltages at the      two-dimensional positions on the object, simultaneously. </PAR><PAR>  In the invention as set forth in claim 19, voltage distribution at the      two-dimensional positions on the object is displayed together with the      wiring configuration of the object superimposed on the former      distribution. More specifically, the optical beam from the observation      light source is first switched by the switching means to enter the      electrooptic material for observation of the wiring configuration of the      object, and the exit light is adjusted in its phase for observation by the      phase compensator means. With such switching and adjustment, the optical      beam from the observation light source enters the electrooptic material as      parallel light and further enters the surface of the object after passing      through the electrooptic material. Herein, there is provided the      dielectric multi-layered film mirror on the bottom surface of the      electrooptic material, which mirror is to transmit the optical beam from      the observation light source therethrough but reflect the optical beam      from the voltage detection light source thereon. The optical beam from the      observation light source incident upon the surface of the object is partly      reflected on the surface of the object is partly reflected on the surface      of the object following the wiring configuration of the same to emanate      from the electrooptic material as exit light. The exit light emanating      from the electrooptic material is directed to enter a two-dimensional      detector through the phase compensator means and is detected by the      detector as visual image data of the wiring configuration of the object.      After the visual image data of the wiring configuration is detected as      such, the optical beam from the pulsed light source is switched by      switching means to enter the electrooptic material for detecting the      voltage at the two-dimensional positions of the object, and the exit light      is adjusted in its phase for voltage detection by the phase compensator      means. Herein, operation of the object is needed to be synchronized with      the pulsed light. With such switching and adjustment, the voltages at the      two-dimensional positions of the object in one sampling timing are      detected by the detector in the same manner as the invention as set forth      in claim 18. Successively, the display means displays the visual image      data of the wiring configuration of the object detected by the detector on      a display and the like together with the voltage distribution of the      object in the one sampling timing superimposed on said visual image data.      Further, the optical beam from the pulsed light source is slightly delayed      through the variable delay means, whereby the voltages at the      two-dimensional positions of the object are detected in a timing slightly      shifted from the previous sampling timing and displayed on the display      means. Hereby, a temporal change in the voltage distribution at the      two-dimensional positions of the object can be observed visually on the      display screen together with the wiring configuration of the object      superimposed on the foregoing temporal change. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  The exact nature of this invention, as well as other objects and advantages      thereof will be readily apparent from consideration of the following      specification relating to the accompanying drawings, in which like      reference characters designated the same or similar parts throughout the      figures thereof and wherein: </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a block diagram exemplarily illustrating the basic construction      of a low noise pulsed light source utilizing a laser diode (LD) according      to the present invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating a stabilized current modulator      circuit in the above basic construction; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a circuit diagram illustrating the construction of a first      embodiment of the present invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is a circuit block diagram exemplarily illustrating the concrete      construction of the first embodiment of the present invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5 is a block diagram illustrating the construction of a second      embodiment of the present invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 6 is a block diagram illustrating the principle of a fourth embodiment      of the present invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 7 is a block diagram exemplarily illustrating the construction of an      E-O sampling device with use of the fourth embodiment; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 8 is a block diagram exemplarily illustrating the construction of a      transmittance measuring device intended to describe the difficulties of      the prior art; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 9 is a block diagram exemplarily illustrating the construction of an      LD pulsed light source used in the device of FIG. 8; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 10 is a diagram illustrating the comparison between frequency      characteristics of noise levels of LD pulsed lights in the prior art and      the embodiment of the present invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 11 is a block diagram exemplarily illustrating a noise component      measuring device used for obtaining the data in FIG. 10; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 12 is a sectional view partly in a block diagram illustrating the      first embodiment of the voltage detector device according to the present      invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 13 and 14 are side views each likewise illustrating the second and      third embodiments; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 15 is a block diagram illustrating the voltage depending of exit light      intensity; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 16 is a front view illustrating a portion of the fourth embodiment of      the voltage detector device; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 17 is a block diagram illustrating a fifth embodiment of the voltage      detector device; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 18 is a block diagram illustrating how to operate in the fifth      embodiment; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 19 is a perspective view illustrating a sixth embodiment of the      voltage detector device; and </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 20 and 21 are block diagrams each illustrating seventh and eighth      embodiment of the voltage detector device. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </PAC><PAR>  In that follows, embodiments of the present invention will be described      with reference to the accompanying drawings. </PAR><PAR>  A first embodiment of the present invention embodies the basic construction      illustrated in FIG. 1 and principally comprises, as illustrated in FIG. 3,      a reverse-biassed pin photodiode (PIN-PD) 43 for detecting part of emitted      light from the LD 38, and a stabilized current modulator circuit 44      composed of a first amplifier 46 for inversely amplifying a photoelectric      current signal yielded by the PIN-PD 43 to alter the DC level of an output      signal and of a second amplifier 48 as an inverted current amplifier for      inverting and amplifying the output of the first amplifier 46. </PAR><PAR>  The first amplifier 46 has a feedback loop that incorporates a capacitor      C.sub.2 for making longer the time constant of the first amplifier 46 than      the repetitive period of the pulsed light. </PAR><PAR>  Additionally, the second amplifier 48 has a feedback loop that incorporates      a diode D for making zero the minimum of the bias current to prevent an      opposite bias current from flowing. </PAR><PAR>  Other features are identical to those in the basic construction illustrated      in FIG. 1 and the description thereof will be omitted. </PAR><PAR>  Operation of the first embodiment is as follows. </PAR><PAR>  As the intensity of pulsed light from the LD 38 is increased, for example,      a photoelectric current from the PIN-PD 43 is increased to raise the      potential at the point a in the figure. Hereby, the output voltage of the      first amplifier 46 is decreased, and hence the output current of the      second amplifier 48 (the direction of the arrow in the figure is assumed      to be positive) or the bias current is decreased. Therefore, the intensity      of the output light from the LD 38 is reduced and controlled such that it      remains unchanged. </PAR><PAR>  Referring to FIG. 4, the concrete construction of the first embodiment is      exemplarily illustrated. In the present example, the amplifiers 46, 48      comprise transistors, capacitors, and resistors, etc., respectively.      Further, a set of the LD 38 and the PIN-PD 38 is housed in the same      package 50, for miniaturization thereof. </PAR><PAR>  In succession, a second embodiment of the present invention will be      described with reference to FIG. 5. </PAR><PAR>  In the second embodiment, a direct current (DC) bias current supplied from      a current source 52 to the LD 38 is made constant, while a signal detected      by the photodetector 42 is amplified by a photoelectric current amplifier      54 and adapted to modulate the amplitude of a pulse voltage applied from      the stabilized electric pulse generator 41, that is controllable in      amplitude over a wide frequency range, to the LD 38. </PAR><PAR>  The stabilized electric pulse generator 41 comprises a light intensity      signal comparator circuit 41A for comparing a signal from the amplifier 54      with a level signal to make constant a DC component such as a temperature      change and temporal drift, etc., involved in the intensity of the LD      pulsed light, a light intensity noise extraction circuit 41B for      stabilizing AC components, that change at high speed, such as ripples,      etc., and an amplitude modulator circuit 41C for modulating the amplitude      of an output pulse voltage on the basis of a signal which has been made      constant in DC components thereof by the just-mentioned circuits and from      which involved noise has been removed. </PAR><PAR>  More specifically, when the intensity of the LD pulsed light is strong, the      amplitude of the pulsed voltage is controlled such that it is reduced.      Hereby, the intensity of the LD pulsed light is kept unchanged and any      involved noise is reduced. </PAR><PAR>  Herein, although in the first and second embodiments any one of the      amplitudes of the DC bias current and the pulse voltage was modulated,      both may be done simultaneously, as disclosed in a third embodiment. In      the third embodiment, it is effective to separate the modulation frequency      regions of the two modulation systems. For example, a frequency range of      from DC to 1 kHz may be controlled by the DC bias current while a      frequency range above 1 kHz may be controlled by the amplitude of the      pulse voltage. </PAR><PAR>  Successively, a fourth embodiment of the present invention will be      described. </PAR><PAR>  In the fourth embodiment, frequency characteristics are provided to the      feedback system (optical detection.fwdarw.amplification.fwdarw.control)      described in the first and second embodiments, and in normalized noise      obtained in such a manner and illustrated in FIG. 6 a lock-in amplifier in      a measuring system is locked at a frequency where less noise is involved. </PAR><PAR>  To be concrete, FIG. 7 exemplarily illustrates the construction of the      fourth embodiment applied to nondestructive E-O sampling for example. In      this construction example, laser light emitted from the LD 38 (pulsed      light for sampling) is fed to an optical probe 58 disposed upwardly of an      IC 56 to be measured through an optical fiber 55 for example. The optical      probe 58 comprises a lens 58A, a half mirror 58B and an electrooptic      crystal 58C, and is adapted to modulate the pulsed light for sampling by      making use of a change in the refractive index of the electrooptic crystal      58C caused by an electric field induced on the surface of the IC 56 by a      current flowing through the same. The pulsed light modulated by the change      in the refractive index is detected by the photodetector 60 and outputted      through the lock-in amplifier 62. The lock-in amplifier 62 and an IC      driver circuit 64, which switches an electric circuit on and off at a      lock-in frequency, are controlled by an output from an oscillator 66 for      switching an electric pulse on and off and outputs a synchronizing signal      to the electric pulse generator 40. </PAR><PAR>  Such construction assures noise detection. Additionally, although it is      generally difficult to assure noise detection over a wide frequency range,      it is possible to realize low noise detection of the whole measuring      system by reducing involved noise at a specific frequency. </PAR><PAR>  Further, as shown in FIG. 7 by two dotts line, it is possible to realize      more low noise detection by inputting the signal of the lock-in frequency      to the light intensity noise extraction circuit 44B (or 41B) of the      stabilized current modulator circuit (or the stabilized electric pulse      generator 41) from the oscillator 66 and by setting the feedback system      including the light intensity noise extraction circuit 41B to have a peak      in its frequency characteristics within the lock-in frequency. </PAR><PAR>  Herein, although in the foregoing embodiments the present invention were      applied to the E-O sampling, the scope of the present invention is not      limited thereto, and may clearly be applied also to fluorescence lifetime      measurement for measuring laser-excited fluorescence, estimation of      response characteristics of a photoelectric detector and an OE IC, etc.,      and time correlated photon counting method using a photomultiplier, and so      on. </PAR><PAR>  In the following, an embodiment of the voltage detector device using the      low noise pulsed light source will be described with reference to the      drawings. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 12 is a sectional view, partly including blocks, illustrating the      embodiment of the voltage detector device of the type of detecting voltage      of an object utilizing a fact that the polarization state of an optical      beam is changed owing to voltage at a predetermined portion of the object. </PAR><PAR>  In FIG. 12, the voltage detector device 70 comprises an optical probe 72,      the same low noise pulsed light source 73 as that illustrated in FIGS. 1      through 5, an optical fiber 75 focusing the optical beam emitted from the      low noise pulsed light source 73 and quiding the same to the optical probe      72 through a focusing lens 74, an optical fiber 77A for guiding reference      light from the optical probe 72 to a photoelectric converter element 77      through a collimator 76, an optical fiber 80A for guiding exit light from      the optical probe 72 to a photoelectric converter element 80 through a      collimator 79, and a comparator circuit 81 for comparing electric signals      subject to the photoelectric conversion from the photoelectric converter      elements 77, 80. </PAR><PAR>  There is disposed in said optical probe 72 two electrooptic materials 72A,      72B each comprising optically uniaxial crystal lithium tantalate      (LiTaO.sub.3). Those electrooptic materials 72A, 72B comprise quite the      same material (optically uniaxial crystal) with their length in the      directions of the optical probe's axis being made equal to each other but      with the optical crystal axes of the electrooptic materials 72A, 72B being      directed to be perpendicular to each other. </PAR><PAR>  A conductive electrode 82 is provided on parts of the outer circumferential      portions of the electrooptic materials 72A and 72B, and the tip end of the      electrooptic material 72B is coated with a reflecting mirror 83 composed      of a metal thin film or a dielectric multi-layer film. </PAR><PAR>  In the optical probe 72 there are further provided a collimator 84,      focusing lenses 85, 86, a polarizer 87 for extrating only an optical beam      with a predetermined polarized component from an optical beam emanating      from the collimator 84, and a beam splitter 89 for dividing the optical      beam with the predetermined polarized component from the polarizer 87 to      reference light and incident light and for directing the exit light from      the electrooptic material 72A to an analyzer 88. Herein, the reference      light and the exit light are guided into the optical fibers 77A, 80A      through the focusing lenses 85, 86, respectively. </PAR><PAR>  Additionally, the conductive electrode 82 is kept at the earth potential.      Hereby, no electric field is therefore existent in the electrooptic      material 72A, so that the refractive index of the electrooptic material      72A is not changed owing to the voltage at the predetermined portion of      the object. Thus, the polarization state of the optical beam propagating      in the electrooptic material 72A is varied only owing to the phase      difference caused by the spontaneous double refraction of the electrooptic      material 72A. </PAR><PAR>  Alternatively, in the electrooptic material 72B the refractive index is      varied by a potential difference between a potential induced on the      reflecting mirror 83 owing to voltage on the predetermined portion of the      workpiece and the earth potential of the conductive electrode 82.      Accordingly, the polarization state of the optical beam propagating in the      electrooptic material 72B is varied in accordance with the voltage of the      predetermined portion of the object and with the phase difference caused      by the spontaneous double refraction of the electrooptic material 72B. </PAR><PAR>  Herein, it should be noticed that since the optical crystal axes of the      electrooptic materials 72A and 72B are perpendicular to each other as      described previously, the change in the polarization state of the optical      beam in the electrooptic material 72A caused by the spontaneous double      refraction and that in the polarization state of the optical beam in the      electrooptic material 72B caused by the spontaneous double refraction are      opposed to each other. </PAR><PAR>  In the voltage detector device 70 with such construction, the optical beam      of a predetermined polarized component emanating from the polarizer 87      enters the electrooptic material 72A as incident light through the beam      splitter 89. The incident 72A is changed in its polarization state owing      to the phase difference due to the spontaneous double refraction, and      enters the electrooptic material 72A. Herein, both electrooptic materials      72A and 72B have their lengths in the directions of the optical probe's      axis equal to each other, so that the incident light on the electrooptic      material 72B is altered in its polarization state oppositely to a case      where it enters the electrooptic material 72A, owing to the phase      difference due to the spontaneous double refraction of the electrooptic      material 72B, and further altered in its polarization state owing to the      change in the refractive index based on the potential of the reflecting      mirror 83. At the time the incident light reaches the reflecting mirror      83, the polarization state of the incident light is therefore changed      corresponding to the change in the refractive index of the electrooptic      material 72B based upon the voltage of the predetermined portion of the      object, and hence eliminates the influence of the phase difference caused      by the spontaneous double refraction. </PAR><PAR>  Likewise, also when the incident light is reflected on the reflecting      mirror 83 and returned back as exit light to the electrooptic materials      72B and 72A, the change in the polarization state of the exit light caused      by the phase difference due to the spontaneous double refraction is      compensated, and the polarization state of the exit light is further      changed correspondingly to the change in the refractive index of the      electrooptic material 72B based upon the voltage of the object. Thus, the      polarization state of the exit light incident on the polarizer 88 is      changed from that of the incident light splitted by the beam splitter 89,      the change including no influence of the phase difference caused by the      spontaneous double refraction of the electrooptic material. </PAR><PAR>  In the voltage detector device 70 so arranged, the tip end of the optical      probe 72 is approached to the object, e.g., an integrated circuit (not      shown). Owing to this, the refractive index of the tip end of the      electrooptic material 72B of the optical probe 72 is changed. More      specifically, there is changed a difference between the refractive indexes      of ordinary light and extraordinary light in a plane perpendicular to the      optical axis in optically uniaxial crystal. </PAR><PAR>  The optical beam emanating from the low noise pulsed light source 73 enters      the collimator 84 of the optical probe 72 through the focusing lens 74 and      the optical fiber 75, and is converted as an intensity I optical beam with      a predetermined polarized component by the polarizer 87 and is incident on      the electrooptic materials 72A, 72B of the optical probe 72 through the      beam splitter 89. Herein, each of the intensities of the reference and      incident lights splitted by the beam splitter 89 is of I/2. Since the      refractive index of the tip end 83 of the electrooptic material 72B is      changed owing to the voltage on the object as described above, the      incident light on the electrooptic material 72B is changed in its      polarization state a the tip end of the electrooptic material 72B      depending on the change in the refractive index of that tip end and      reaches the reflecting mirror 83, on which mirror it is turn reflected      back toward the beam splitter 89 as exit light from the electrooptic      material 72B. Assumed here the length of the electrooptic material 72B to      be 1, the polarization state of the incident light is changed in      proportion to the difference between the refractive indexes of the      ordinary light and the extraordinary light and to the length 1. The exit      light returned back to the beam splitter 89 enters the analyzer 88. </PAR><PAR>  Herein, the intensity of the exit light incident on the analyzer 88 is of      I/4 owing to the beam splitter 89. Provided the analyzer 88 is constructed      so as for only an optical beam of a polarized component perpendicular to      the polarization direction of the polarizer 87 to pass therethrough, the      intensity I/4 exit light changed in its polarization state and entering      the analyzer 88 is modulated in its intensity by the analyzer 88 as (I/4)      sin.sup.2 andlsqb;(.pi./2).multidot.V/V.sub.0 andrsqb;, and is incident on the      photoelectric converter element 80. Herein, V is the voltage on the      object, and V.sub.0 is half-wavelength voltage. </PAR><PAR>  In the comparater circuit 81, there are compared the intensity I/2 of the      reference light converted photoelectrically in the photoelectric converter      element 77 and the intensity (I/4).multidot. sin .sup.2 andlsqb;(.pi./2)V/V.sub.0      andrsqb; of the exit light converted photoelectrically in the photoelectric      converter element 80. </PAR><PAR>  Since the intensity of the exit light (I/4).multidot. sin .sup.2      andlsqb;(.pi./2)V/V.sub.0 andrsqb; is altered by the change in the refractive index of      the tip end 83 of the electrooptic material 72B caused by the voltage      change, voltage of an object to be measured, e.g., a predetermined portion      of an integrated circuit can be detected on the basis of the alteration of      the exit light intensity. </PAR><PAR>  In the voltage detector device 70 illustrated in FIG. 12, as described      above, voltage of a predetermined portion of an object is detected on the      basis of the change in the refractive index of the tip end of the      electrooptic material 72B which is changed as the tip end of the optical      probe 72 approaches the object. Accordingly, there can be detected,      without contact with the optical probe 72, voltage of a fine portion of an      integrated circuit which is particularly difficult in contact with      external means and in which measured voltage is badly affected by contact,      if possible, with such external means. Further, with use of the low noise      pulsed light source 73 including a laser diode which emits a very short      duration optical pulse as the light source, a high speed voltage change      can accurately be detected by sampling the high speed voltage change of      the object at a ultrashort time interval. </PAR><PAR>  It should now be noticed that many electrooptic materials such as one used      in the optical probe 72 of the voltage detector device 70 illustrated in      FIG. 12 after demonstrates inherent double refraction. In optical uniaxial      crystal lithium tantalate (LiTaO.sub.3) for example, there is produced a      phase difference between ordinary and extraordinary lights of incident      light caused by the inherent double refraction proportional to a      difference between the refractive indexes n.sub.0 and n.sub.e of the      ordinary and extraordinary lights. The phase difference so caused by the      inherent double refraction can be produced even without the application of      any voltage to such an optical uniaxial crystal, and alter the      polarization state of the incident light. It is therefore needed to cancel      out the phase change in the incident light due to the spontaneous double      refraction when it is contemplated that only the change in the      polarization state of the incident light due to the refractive index      changes upon application of voltage thereto is extracted to accurately      detect the voltage of an object to be measured. </PAR><PAR>  Further, for highly sensitively detecting voltage of a predetermined      portion of an object, a DC component is must be removed from the exit      light emanating from the analyzer 88. </PAR><PAR>  More specifically, in the case where the voltage of the predetermined      portion to be measured is one changing at a high speed superimposed on the      DC voltage, it is necessary to remove the change in the polarization state      which depends on the DC voltage, because only the voltage component      changing at a high speed should here be detected. </PAR><PAR>  To solve this, there is known a technique wherein a phase compensator is      provided between the beam splitter 89 and the electrooptic material, which      compensator is in turn adjusted to single out only one due to voltage      applied to the electrooptic material as the change in the polarization      state of the exit light emanating from the electrooptic material. This      technique however suffers from a problem that even though the phase      compensator is adjusted manually to the predetermined value at the      initiation of the voltage detection, the adjusted value set upon the      initiation of the voltage detection is inadequate and obstructs an      accurate result from being detected over the entire period of the voltage      detection. </PAR><PAR>  In the above embodiment, in addition to the provision of the electrooptic      material 72B subject to the influence of the voltage of a predetermined      portion of an object to be measured, there is disposed the electrooptic      material 72A which comprises the same material as that of the electrooptic      material 72B and has the same length in the direction of the optical      probe's axis as that of the same such that the latter electrooptic      material 72A is perpendicular in its optical crystal axis to the optical      crystal axis of the former. With the electrooptic material 72A not      including therein any electric field, hereby, the changes in the      polarization state of the optical beam based on the phase differences by      the spontaneous double refractions of the electrooptic materials 72A, 72B      can be cancelled each other. Thus, the polarization state of the exit      light incident on the analyzer 88 can be changed with respect to the      polarization state of the incident light by the amount dependent on only      the voltage applied to the electrooptic material 72B. </PAR><PAR>  Hereby, there is required no complicated operation upon the initiation of      the voltage detection such as the adjustment of the phase compensator, and      even though the ambient temperature varies, the phase changes in the      optical beam by the spontaneous double refraction of the electrooptic      materials 72A, 72B are changed quite similarly so that the changes in the      polarization state of the optical beam based on the phase differences of      the same by the spontaneous double refractions can be cancelled at all      times. </PAR><PAR>  Although in the above embodiment the phase differences by the spontaneous      double refractions of the electrooptic materials are compensated by      permitting the first and second electrooptic materials to the disposed      such that their optical crystal axes are perpendicular to each other, this      may be achieved by other means such as a .lambda./2 plate 91 for example,      instead of the optical probe 90 of the second embodiment of the voltage      detector device illustrated in FIG. 13 in which the optical crystal axes      of the electrooptic materials 72C and 72B are located perpendicularly to      each other. </PAR><PAR>  Herein, the conductive electrode 82 has been provided on the electrooptic      material 72C, the outer periphery of the .lambda./2 plate 91, and part of      the outer periphery of the electrooptic material 72B. The conductive      electrode 82 is kept at ground potential and so no electric field is      existent in the electrooptic material 72C. </PAR><PAR>  Referring to FIG. 14, there is illustrated in a sectional view, a portion      of the third embodiment of the voltage detector device according to the      present invention. </PAR><PAR>  In a voltage detector device 92 of FIG. 4, the same low noise pulsed light      source 73 as that described above is used, and there are disposed in an      optical probe 93 two electrooptic materials 72a, 72B with their lengths      equal to each other in the direction of the optical probe's axis and with      their optical crystal axes directed perpendicularly to each other as in      the voltage detector device 70 of FIG. 12. Further, a transparent      electrode 94 is interposed between the electrooptic materials 72A and 72B      and a transparent electrode 95 is provided oppositely to the side of the      electrooptic material 72A where the former transparent electrode 94 is      provided. </PAR><PAR>  The transparent electrodes 94, 95 transmit incident light upon and exit      light from the electrooptic materials 72A and 72B. In use, the transparent      electrode 94 is kept at the ground potential and the transparent electrode      95 is subject to variable voltage V.sub.B. Accordingly, the electrooptic      material 72B changes its refractive index owing to a potential difference      between the voltage of an object to be measured and the ground potential      of the transparent electrode 94, while the electrooptic material 72A      changes its refractive index owing to a potential difference between the      variable voltage V.sub.B exerted on the transparent electrode 95 and the      ground potential of the transparent electrode 94. Herein, the transparent      electrode 94 is disposed parallely to the reflecting mirror 83 such that      electric lines of force from the object through the reflecting mirror 83      is parallely to the central axis of the electrooptic material 72B in the      electrooptic material 72B. Hereby the refractive index change is made      uniform everywhere in the electrooptic material 72B. The transparent      electrode 95 is likewise disposed to be parallel to the transparent      electrode 94, so that the refractive index change is made uniform      everywhere in the electrooptic material 72A. </PAR><PAR>  In the voltage detector device 92 constructed as above, the electrooptic      materials 72A and 73B are equal in their lengths to each other and      perpendicular in their optical crystal axes as in the voltage detector      device 70 of FIG. 1, so that the phase differences by the spontaneous      double refractions of those electrooptic materials can be cancelled at all      times even though the ambient temperature varies. Additionally, provided      with application of the predetermined voltage V.sub.B to the transparent      electrode 95 a predetermined refractive index change is produced in the      electrooptic material 72A, an operating point shown in FIG. 15 can be      shifted from P1 to P2 to eliminate a DC component from the polarization      state of the exit light from the electrooptic material 72B. Further, the      intensity of the exit light at the operating point P2 is changed as the      ambient temperature is changed. Accordingly, provided the operating point      P2 is slightly shifted by automatically changing the voltage V.sub.B      following the temperature change, the variations of the exit light      intensity caused by the ambient temperature can be compensated. More      specifically, provided the voltage V.sub.B is automatically changed      following the temperature change to change the refractive index of the      electrooptic material 72A, the exit light intensity is prevented from      varying as the ambient temperature changes. </PAR><PAR>  According to the present embodiment, the electrooptic material 72A and 72B      can be controlled at all times such that the phase difference of the      incident light by the spontaneous double refraction of the electrooptic      material can be cancelled at all times, and that the operating point can      be set so as for the DC component to be eliminated from the exit light      intensity by applying the variable voltage V.sub.B to the transparent      electrode 95, and further that the exit light intensity from which the DC      component has been eliminated can be compensated so as not be varied by      the temperature change. </PAR><PAR>  In the following, a fourth embodiment of the voltage detector device of the      present invention will be described with reference to FIG. 16. </PAR><PAR>  In a voltage detector device 96, there is provided an electrooptic material      97A with its frusto-conical tip end 97B such as optically uniaxial crystal      lithium tantalate (LiTaO.sub.3) and lithium niobate (LiNbO.sub.3), etc.,      is provided in an optical probe 97 as in the aforementioned voltage      detector device, and there is provided a metal thin film reflecting mirror      98 on the tip end 97B of the electrooptic material 97A for reflecting      incident light IB having a predetermined polarized component as exit light      RB. Herein, the metal thin film reflecting mirror 98 reflects the incident      light IB thereon as described previously and includes voltage at a      predetermined portion of an object to be measured. </PAR><PAR>  Also in the voltage detector device 96, a transparent electrode 99 with its      surface directed perpendicularly to the central axis A--A of the optical      probe 97 is provided above the electrooptic material 97A. The transparent      electrode 99 is coated thereon with an antireflection film. The      transparent electrode 99 transmits the incident light IB and reflected      light RB without affecting those light and makes uniform a refractive      index change in the electrooptic material 97A caused by the voltage at the      predetermined portion of the object. </PAR><PAR>  Herein, since in the present embodiment, excepting the provision of the      optical probe 97 constructed with the single electrooptic material 97A,      the reflecting mirror 98, and the transparent electrode 99, the low noise      pulsed light source 73 and other arrangement are the same as that in the      embodiment illustrated in FIG. 12, and hence the illustration and      description thereof will be omitted. </PAR><PAR>  In the voltage detector device 96 constructed as described above, once the      optical probe 97 is approached to an object 100 to be measured, the      voltage at the predetermined portion of the object is induced on the metal      thin film reflecting mirror 98. More specifically, there is induced on the      metal thin film reflecting mirror 98 a potential caused by voltage of part      INAR of the object located just under the reflecting mirror 98 and voltage      of part OTAR located outside the part INAR. When the transparent electrode      99 is kept at ground potential for example, there is generated in the      electrooptic material 97A an electric line of force ELN1 on the basis of a      potential difference between the potential of the metal film reflecting      mirror 98 and the ground potential of the transparent electrode 99. It      should here be noticed that the surface of the transparent electrode 99 is      positioned to be perpendicular to the central axis A--A of the optical      probe 1 and the transparent electrode 99 is positioned to be parallel to      the metal thin film reflecting mirror 98, so that the electric line of      force ELN1 generated in the electrooptic material 97A is parallel to the      central axis A--A of the electrooptic material 97A. Hereby, the refractive      index change of the electrooptic material 97A caused by the electric line      of force ELN1 is made uniform over the whole of the electrooptic material      97A, and so the optical beams in the electrooptic material 97A, i.e., the      polarized components of the incident light IB and of the reflected light      RB are changed accurately corresponding to the voltage of the      predetermined portion of the object to permit the voltage of the      predetermined portion of the object 100 to be accurately detected. </PAR><PAR>  Herein, although in the optical probe 97 of the voltage detector device the      metal thin film reflecting mirror 98 was mounted on the tip end 97B of the      electrooptic material 97A, it may be a dielectric multi-layer film. </PAR><PAR>  In the following, a fifth embodiment of the voltage detector device will be      described with reference to FIG. 17. </PAR><PAR>  In a voltage detector device 101, an electrooptic material 102 is fixedly      mounted in close vicinity of or in contact with an object to be measured      such as an IC (integrated circuit) 56, etc. The electrooptic material 102      is formed into a columnar or plate shape with its section so cut out as to      be enough large compared with that of the electrooptic material contained      in the optical probe of the conventional voltage detector device and as to      cover a plurality of measurement positions on the IC 56. Further, a metal      or dielectric multi-layer film reflecting mirror 103 is formed on the      bottom of the electrooptic material 102. In the case with the metal      reflecting mirror formed, the measurement should be done without making      contact with the IC 56 or through an insulator disposed on the surface of      the IC 56. </PAR><PAR>  The voltage detector device 101 includes a low noise pulsed light source      73, a polarizer 104 for extracting a specific polarized component from an      optical beam emitted from the low noise pulsed light source 73, two      movable mirrors 105, 106 for guiding a predetermined polarized component      optical beam extracted through the polarizer 104, a beam splitter 107 for      directing to the electrooptic material 102 as incident light the optical      beam guided by the movable mirrors 105, 106 and splitting exit light from      the electrooptic material 102, an analyzer 109 for extracting a      predetermined polarized component from the exit light splitted by the beam      splitter 107 and changed in its polarization state, and a detector 110 for      receiving exit light from the analyzer 109. </PAR><PAR>  An electric signal detected by the detector 110 is fed to a computer 111,      subject to data processing in the same, stored in a memory (not shown),      and displayed on a display 112 upon completion of the voltage detection      processing. </PAR><PAR>  In the voltage detector device 101, the electrooptic material 102 is cut      out so as to cover the plurality of measurement positions of the IC 56 to      successively detect voltages at the plurality of measurement positions of      the IC 56, as described previously. Thereupon, the incident light is      scanned in the directions of X and Y axes as illustrated in FIG. 17 and is      satisfactorily focused for its incidence on the electrooptic material 102. </PAR><PAR>  The movable mirror 105 to provided for scanning of the incident light in      the X axis direction, while the movable mirror 106 provided for scanning      of the same in the Y axis direction. More specifically, the movable      mirrors 105, 106 are driven by a driving circuit 113 controlled by the      computer 111 when the computer 111 judges the voltage detection at a      certain measurement position on the IC 56 has been completed, to      successively scan the optical beam in the directions of the X and Y axes. </PAR><PAR>  In the voltage detector device 101 arranged as described above, the optical      beam from the low noise pulsed light source 73 is extracted in its      specific polarized component by the polarizer 104, which component is in      turn guided by the movable mirrors 105, 106 and satisfactorily stopped      through the beam splitter 107 for incidence on the electrooptic material      102. The movable mirrors 105, 106 are assumed to be first set such that      the incident light enters the electrooptic material 102 at a location      (x.sub.1, y.sub.1) illustrated in FIG. 18 for example. Since a portion of      the electrooptic material 102 at the location (x.sub.1, y.sub.1) is      changed in its refractive index corresponding to the voltage of the object      located just under that portion, the incident light entering the      electrooptic material 102 at that location (x.sub.1, y.sub.1) is changed      in its polarization state is response to that refractive index change, and      is reflected on a reflecting mirror 103, allowed to emanate as exit light      from the electrooptic material 102, and is received by the detector 110      through the beam splitter 107 and the analyzer 109. The detector 110      detects the voltage of the IC 56 at the measurement position of the same      located just under the portion of the electrooptic material 102 at the      location (x.sub.1, y.sub.1) of the same, and feeds it to the computer 111.      The computer 111 executes the predetermined data processing for the      voltage at the measurement position of the IC 56 located just under the      portion at the detected location (x.sub.1, y.sub.1), stores it in the      memory (not shown), and controls the driving circuit 113 which in turn      drives the movable mirror 105 for detecting voltage at a measurement      position of the IC 56 located just under a portion of the electrooptic      material 102 at a next scanned position of the same. Hereby, the movable      mirror 105 is moved in the direction of the axis X so as cause the      incident light to enter the electrooptic material 102 at the next scanned      position of the same for the same voltage detection processing as in the      above description. </PAR><PAR>  Once the movable mirror 105 is successively moved in such a manner in the      direction of the axis X, the incident light is set to enter the      electrooptic material 102 at the location (x.sub.n, y.sub.1) of the same,      and voltage at a measurement position of the IC 56 located just under a      portion of the electrooptic material 102 at a location (x.sub.n, y.sub.1)      of the same has been detected, the computer 111 controls the driving      circuit 113 such that the latter drives the movable mirrors 105, 106 for      scanning in the direction of the axis X at the next location y.sub.2 in      the direction of the axis Y. Hereby, the movable mirror 106 is set such      that the incident light enters the electrooptic material 102 at the next      scanned position y.sub.2 in the direction of the axis Y, and the movable      mirror 105 is moved from the position x.sub.1 to the position x.sub.n      successively for the same voltage detection processing as described above      at the locations from the location (x.sub.1, y.sub.2) to the location      (x.sub.n, y.sub.2) of the electrooptic material 102. </PAR><PAR>  The movable mirror 106 is set such that the incident light enters the      electrooptic material 102 at the scanned location y.sub.n in the direction      of the axis Y and the movable mirror 105 is moved successively from the      location x.sub.1 to the location x.sub.n to detect voltages at locations      from the location (x.sub.1, y.sub.m) to the location (x.sub.n, y.sub.m) of      the electrooptic material 102 for the completion of the voltage detection      at a plurality of the measurement locations of the IC 56. Herein, a      voltage detection result at each measurement position stored in the memory      (not shown) of the computer 111 upon the completion of the voltage      detection is displayed on the display 112. </PAR><PAR>  In the voltage detection device 101 in the present embodiment arranged as      described above, the optical beam stopped onto the electrooptic material      102 is successively scanned in the state of the electrooptic material 102      being fixed and is allowed to be incident upon the electrooptic material      102 to detect the voltages at a plurality of measurement positions of the      IC 56. </PAR><PAR>  Herein, an acoustooptic deflector may be incorporated instead of the      movable mirrors 105, 106. The acoustooptic deflector is driven by a      driving circuit controlled by the computer 111 to deflect the optical beam      from the polarizer 104 in the directions of the axes X and Y. </PAR><PAR>  Hereby, it is possible, in quite the same manner as in the voltage detector      device 101 illustrated in FIG. 17, to detect voltage of an object to be      measured such as the IC 56 and the like at a plurality of measurement      positions on the object by directing the stopped optical beam to the      electrooptic material 2 and scanning successively the optical beam in the      directions of the axes X and Y. </PAR><PAR>  Additionally, although in the voltage detector device 101 the optical beam      from the low noise pulsed light source 73 was deflected and scanned, the      electrooptic material 102 may instead be scanned by moving the      electrooptic material 102 and the object in the directions of the axes X      and Y. </PAR><PAR>  In this case, the optical beam from the light source 73 and the polarizer      104 is adapted to directly enter the electrooptic material 102 without      being polarized from the beam splitter 107 without intervention of the      movable mirrors 105, 106 or the acoustooptic deflector. Herein, the      optical beam incident upon the electrooptic material 102 has      satisfactorily stopped. On the other hand, there is driven a motor table      for moving both the electrooptic material 102 and the object in the      directions of the axes X and Y, respectively, through the driving circuit      controlled by the computer 111. </PAR><PAR>  Herein, although in the above description both the electrooptic material      102 and the object were moved, only the object may be moved. </PAR><PAR>  In the following, a sixth embodiment of the voltage detector device will be      described with reference to FIG. 19. </PAR><PAR>  In a voltage detector device 114 of FIG. 19, the electrooptic material 102      is cut out into a size in its cross section so as to cover a plurality of      two-dimensional locations of an object to be measured such as the IC 56      and the like, as in the foregoing embodiment of FIG. 17. A metal or      dielectric multi-layer reflecting mirror 103 is formed on the bottom of      the electrooptic material 102. </PAR><PAR>  The voltage detector device 114 includes a polarizer 104 for extracting a      predetermined polarized component from an optical beam BM emitted from a      low noise pulsed light source 73, a microlens array 115 for dividing an      optical beam of the predetermined polarized component extracted by the      polarizer to many optical beams BM.sub.ij exhibiting together a      lattice-shaped pattern, a beam splitter 107 for directing the      lattice-shaped pattern many optical beams BM.sub.ij divided by the      microlens array 111 as incident light toward the electrooptic material      102, and for splitting for voltage detection a lattice-shaped pattern many      exit lights SG.sub.ij reflected on the reflecting mirror 103 disposed on      the bottom of the electrooptic material 102 and emanating from the      electrooptic material 102, an analyzer 109 for transmitting therethrough      only an optical beam of a predetermined polarized component among the exit      lights SG.sub.ij from the beam splitter 107, and a detector 116 for      receiving the exit light transmitted by the analyzer 109. </PAR><PAR>  The microlens array 115 comprises a plurality of first rod lenses 115A all      aligned in a specific direction, and a plurality of second rod lenses 115B      all aligned in the direction perpendicular to the first rod lenses, both      being superimposed, whereby the optical beam is divided into a      lattice-shape. </PAR><PAR>  The detector 116 comprises a two-dimensional photodetector such as a CCD      camera, a photodiode array, and a vision camera, etc., and a high speed      detector such as a streak camera, etc. </PAR><PAR>  In the voltage detector device 114 arranged as described above, the      electrooptic material 102 is cut out in its section into a size to cover a      plurality two-dimensional positions on the IC 56. Accordingly, there are      changed refractive indexes of local portions on the electrooptic material      102 corresponding to the two-dimensional positions owing to the voltages      at those plurality of the two-dimensional positions of the IC 56. </PAR><PAR>  Therefore, when many optical beams BM.sub.ij of the lattice-shaped pattern      having the predetermined polarized component divided by the microlens      array 115 propagate along the lattice-shaped part in the electrooptic      material 102, those optical beams BM.sub.ij are changed in their      polarization states owing to the refractive index change at at the      lattice-shaped part in the electrooptic material 102 caused by the      voltages at the lattice-shaped positions on the IC 56 just under the      lattice-shaped part, and allowed to emanate from the electrooptic material      102 as exit lights. These exit lights enter the analyzer 109 via the beam      splitter 107. Provided the analyzer 109 is adapted to transmit      therethrough only the optical beam of the polarized component      perpendicular to the polarization direction of the polarizer 104 for      example, the exit lights SG.sub.ij changed in the polarization states and      entering the polarizer 109 are changed in their intensity by the polarizer      109 as being proportional to sin.sup.2 andlsqb;(.pi./2)V.sub.ij /V.sub.0 andrsqb;, and      allowed to enter the photodetector 116. Herein, V.sub.ij to the voltage at      the two-dimensional lattice position (i, j) on the IC 56, and V.sub.0 is a      half-wave voltage. </PAR><PAR>  In such a manner, the intensity of each exit light is changed owing to the      refractive index of the local portion on the electrooptic material 102      following the voltage change at each lattice position on the IC 56. On the      basis of this, in the detector 116, only the voltages at the      two-dimensional lattice positions among overall two-dimensional positions      on the object such as the IC 56 can simultaneously be detected. </PAR><PAR>  In the present embodiment, although many optical beams BM.sub.ij      two-dimensional lattice-shaped pattern were formed with use of the      microlens array 115, and allowed to enter the electrooptic material 102 to      detect the voltages at the two-dimensional lattice positions of the      object, there may sometimes be a case where it is desired to detect      voltages at arbitrary two-dimensional positions on the object. </PAR><PAR>  In this case, it is possible to detect the voltages at the arbitrary      two-dimensional positions on the object by disposing a plate-shaped mask      behind the microlens array 115, and extracting only desired optical beams      using that mask and directing to permit those beams to the electrooptic      material 102. </PAR><PAR>  Further, a holographic lens may be employed, instead of the microlens array      115 on which such a hologram has been recorded that the optical beam is      focused only at a specific two-dimensional portion on the electrooptic      material 102. </PAR><PAR>  Additionally, a spatial light modulator may be employed instead of the      microlens array. </PAR><PAR>  In the following, a seventh embodiment of the voltage detector device will      be described with reference to FIG. 20. </PAR><PAR>  Also in a voltage detector device of FIG. 20, a similar electrooptic      material 102 to those described in the embodiments of FIGS. 17 and 19 is      disposed in close vicinity to an object to be measured such as the IC 56      or brought into contact with and fixed to the IC 56. The electrooptic      material 102 is cut down, in its section, into an enough size to cover a      plurality of two-dimensional positions on the object. Further, there is      formed a reflecting mirror 103 comprising a metal or dielectric      multi-layer film on the bottom of the electrooptic material 102. </PAR><PAR>  The voltage detector device 117 includes a low noise pulsed light source 73      for emitting a very short pulse duration optical beam, variable delay      means 118 for variably delaying the optical beam from the low noise pulsed      light source 73, an expanding optical system 119 for expanding and      collimating the optical beam delayed by the variable delay means 118 to a      two-dimensional expanse, i.e., an expansed and collimated optical beam, a      polarizer 104 for extracting a predetermined polarized component from the      optical beam collimated by the expanding optical system 119, a beam      splitter 107 for directing the collimated light, i.e., optical beam having      the predetermined polarized component extracted by the polarizer 104 to      the electrooptic material 102 and splitting for the voltage detection exit      light reflected on the reflecting mirror 103 formed on the bottom of the      electrooptic material 102 and emanating from the electrooptic material 102      and directly the splitted exit light toward a focusing optical system, a      phase compensator for adjusting the phase of exit light from the focusing      optical system, an analyzer 109 for transmitting therethrough only an      optical beam having a predetermined polarized component in the exit light      adjusted in its phase by the phase compensator 121, and a photodetector      116 for receiving the exit light transmitted through the analyzer 109. </PAR><PAR>  The collimated light incident upon the electrooptic material 102 is      expanded by the expanding optical system 119 into the two-dimensional      expanse, and allowed to enter the electrooptic material 102 uniformly with      the predetermined expanse. The collimated light incident uniformly upon      the electrooptic material 102 is changed in its polarization state owing      to the refractive index changes of two-dimensional portions corresponding      to two-dimensional positions on the electrooptic material 102, the change      being caused by voltages at a plurality of the two-dimensional positions      of the IC 56 as the object, because the electrooptic material 102 has been      cut down in its section into a size enough to cover those two-dimensional      positions on the object, and is allowed to emanate from the electrooptic      material 102 as exit light. In other words, the exit light emanating from      the electrooptic material 102 has identical spreading to that of      collimated light, and the changes in the polarization states at various      parts of the exit light reflect the voltages at the respective      two-dimensional positions on the object. </PAR><PAR>  The phase compensator 121 is to adjust the phase of the exit light and is      to set the polarized component of the exit light extracted by the analyzer      109 to a predetermined angle with respect to that of the collimated light      extracted by the polarizer 104, i.e., it is to arrange the polarized      component of the exit light extracted by the analyzer 109 in the same      direction as or perpendicularly to that of the collimated light extracted      by the polarizer 104. </PAR><PAR>  The detector 116 is a two-dimensional photodetector such as a CCD camera, a      photodiode array, and a vidicon camera, etc., and is to detect the      intensity of the exit light from the analyzer 109 for simultaneous      detection of the voltage at the two-dimensional positions on the object      based upon the changes in the refractive indexes of the electrooptic      material 102. </PAR><PAR>  In the case where the low noise pulsed light source 73 and the      two-dimensional detector 116 are employed in combination, the voltages at      the two-dimensional positions on the object must be changed periodically      in synchronism with the optical pulse. More specifically, the optical beam      from the low noise pulsed light source 73 is halved into two optical beams      by the beam splitter 122, one of which is fed to the variable delay means      118 for sampling and the other of which is sent to the detector 123 for      photoelectric conversion. An electric signal yielded by the photoelectric      conversion reaches the driving circuit 125 via the trigger circuit 124 to      actuate the object periodically in synchronism with the optical pulse.      Such repeatedly varying voltage is detected by the sampling. The sampling      is achieved by gradually delaying the optical beam from the low noise      pulsed light source 73 by the variable delay means 118, and such operation      of the variable delay means 118 is controlled by the computer 111. More      specifically, after the detector 116 detects the voltages at the      two-dimensional positions on the IC 56 in certain timing, the computer 111      processed those voltages, and stores processed data in the memory (not      shown) while controlling the driving circuit 126, which driving circuit      126 in turn drives the variable delay means 115 to delay the optical beam      from the low noise pulsed light source 73 and hence slightly shift the      sampling timing. Thus, temporal changes in the voltages at the      two-dimensional positions on the object can be detected. </PAR><PAR>  In the voltage detector device 117 arranged as such, the phase compensator      121 is first adjusted to direct the polarized component of the exit light      extracted by the analyzer 109 perpendicularly to that of the collimated      light extracted by the polarizer 104. Hereby, when the polarization state      of the exit light from the electrooptic material 102 is the same as the      collimated light incident upon the electrooptic material 102, (when no      voltage is applied to the electrooptic material 102), the exit light is      prevented from being transmitted by the analyzer 109. After the phase      compensator 121 is set in such a manner, the voltage measurement at the      two-dimensional positions on the object is started. </PAR><PAR>  The electrooptic material 102 is changed in the refractive indexes thereof      corresponding to the two-dimensional positions owing to the      two-dimensional positions on the object because the electrooptic material      102 has been cut down in its section in to a size enough to cove the      two-dimensional positions on the object (IC 56). Accordingly, the      collimated light incident uniformly upon the electrooptic state owing to      the changes in the refractive indexes of the two-dimensional portions on      the electrooptic material 102 corresponding to the two-dimensional      positions on the object, and allowed to emanate from the electrooptic      material 102 as exit lights. These exit lights further enters the phase      compensator 121 via the beam splitter 107 and the focusing optical system      120, and is adjusted in its phase by the phase compensator 121 and is      incident upon the analyzer 109. The phase compensator 121 has been      adjusted such that the analyzer 109 transmits only the optical beam of the      polarized component perpendicular in that the polarizer 104, so that the      intensities of the exit lights incident upon the analyzer 109 are allowed      to be proportional to sin.sup.2 andlsqb;(.pi./2).multidot.V.sub.ij /V.sub.0 andrsqb; by      the analyzer 109 and to enter the analyzer 116. Herein, V.sub.ij is the      voltage at the two-dimensional position (i, j) on the object, and V.sub.0      is the half-wave voltage. </PAR><PAR>  The exit lights are changed owing to the changes in the refractive indexes      of local portions of the electrooptic material 102 caused by the changes      in the voltages at the two-dimensional positions of the object, as      described above. The detector 116 can therefore detect simultaneously the      voltage at the two-dimensional positions on the object such as an      integrated circuit on the basis of the refractive index changes. </PAR><PAR>  As the detector 116 detects the voltage at the two-dimensional positions on      the object in a certain timing, the computer 111 stores a detected result      in the memory. Further, for detecting the voltage in successive timings,      the computer 111 controls the driving circuit 126 to drive the variable      delay means 118, whereby the optical beam from the low noise pulsed light      source 73 is delayed by a predetermined amount to shift the sampling      timing a little at a time for repeated like voltage detection. The      temporal changes in the voltages at the two-dimensional positions on the      object are thus sampled and measured. The computer 111 stores measured      results in the memory, and displays those voltage detection results on the      display 112 at the time the sampling measurement within a predetermined      time range has been completed, and overall processings are completed. </PAR><PAR>  Although in the above embodiment only the voltages at the two-dimensional      positions on the object were detected and displayed on the display 112,      there is sometimes a case desired by users in which a wiring configuration      of an object to be measured such as an integrated circuit is further      observed simultaneously with the voltage detection and the voltages at the      two-dimensional positions are superimposed on and displayed with the      observed wiring configuration. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 21 is a block diagram illustrating an eighth embodiment of the voltage      detector device in which the voltages at the two-dimensional positions can      be displayed, superimposed on the wiring configuration of an object to be      measured. Herein, the same portions as those in FIG. 20 are denoted by the      same symbols in FIG. 21, and the description will be omitted. </PAR><PAR>  In a voltage detector device 130 of FIG. 21, there is incorporated,      independently of the low noise pulsed light source 73, an observation      light source 131 for emitting pulsed light or DC light to observe the      wiring configuration of an object to be measured such as the IC 56 and the      like. An optical beam emitted from the observation light source 131 has      its wavelength different from that of the optical beam emitted from the      low noise pulsed light source 73. More specifically, the optical beam from      the low noise pulsed light source 73 is reflected on the dielectric      multi-layer film mirror 103A formed on the bottom of the electrooptic      material 102, whereas the optical beam from the observation light source      131 is transmitted by the dielectric multi-layer film mirror and impinges      on the surface of the object. </PAR><PAR>  The optical beam from the observation light source 131 and the optical beam      from the low noise pulsed light source 73 are switched each other by      switching means 133 under the control of the computer 111. The switching      means 133 selects, upon observing the wiring configuration of the object,      the optical beam from the observation light source 131 and forces the      optical beam to enter the object through the electrooptic material 102,      whilst if selects, upon detecting the voltages at the two-dimensional      positions on the object, the optical beam from the low noise pulsed light      source 73 and forces the same to enter the electrooptic material 102. </PAR><PAR>  The phase compensator 121, which is adjusted by the computer 111, is      adjusted upon observing the wiring configuration of the object, such that      the analyzer 109 transmits the exits light of the same polarized component      as the polarization direction of the polarizer 104, while it is adjusted,      upon detecting the voltages at the two-dimensional positions on the      object, such that the analyzer 109 transmits the exit light of the      polarized component perpendicular to the polarization direction of the      polarizer 104. </PAR><PAR>  In the voltage detector device 130 arranged as such, the computer 111      controls, first observing the wiring configuration of an object, the      switching means to force the optical beam from the observation light      source 131 to enter as collimated light the surface of the object, while      it adjusts the phase compensator 121 such that the analyzer 109 transmits      the exit light of the same polarized component as the polarization      direction of the polarizer 104. </PAR><PAR>  Hereby, the optical beam from the observation light source 131 enters as      collimated light the electrooptic material 102 through the variable delay      means 118, the expanding optical system 119, the polarizer 104, and the      beam splitter 107, and is transmitted by the dielectric multi-layer film      mirror 103A and permitted to enter the surface of the IC 56 being as the      object. The collimated light incident upon the surface of the object is      partly reflected back depending on the wiring configuration and material      quality of the object surface across the dielectric multi-layer film      mirror 103A and the electrooptic material 102 and enters the analyzer 109      as exit light via the beam splitter 107, the focusing optical system 120,      and the phase compensator 121. Herein, the phase compensator 121 has been      adjusted such at the analyzer 109 transmits the exit light of the same      polarized component as the polarization direction of the polarizer 104.      Accordingly, the exit light incident upon the analyzer 109 is transmitted      by the analyzer 109 intactly and impinges the two-dimensional detector 116      such as a CCD camera. The exit light impinging the detector 116 involves      visible image information concerning the wiring configuration on the      surface of the object. The detector 116 subjects it to photoelectric      conversion to yield visible image data concerning the wiring      configuration. The resulting visible image data is fed to be computer 111      and stored in the memory (not shown) of the same. </PAR><PAR>  After the visible image data concerning the wiring configuration of the      object has been yielded, the computer 111 subjects the variable delay      means 118 to initial setting, and controls the switching means 133 such      that the optical beams from the low noise pulsed source 73 enters the      electrooptic material 102 as collimated light. The computer 111 further      adjusts the phase compensator 121 such that the analyzer 109 transmits the      exit light of the polarized component perpendicular to the polarization      direction of the polarizer 104, to simultaneously detect the voltages at      the two-dimensional positions on the object. Thereupon, the optical beam      from the low noise pulsed light source 73, after entering the electrooptic      material 102 as collimated light, is reflected on the dielectric      multi-layer film mirror 103A and is changed in its polarization state      following the refractive index change of the electrooptic material 102,      and further enters as exit light the phase compensator 121 and the      analyzer 109. The analyzer 109 transmits only the exit light of the      predetermined polarized component to permit it to enter the      two-dimensional detector 116. The detector 116 samples and simultaneously      detects the voltages at the two-dimensional positions on the object in      timing set by the variable delay means 118. A result of the voltage      detection in one timing is fed to the computer 111 and stored in the      memory. Thereafter, the result of the voltage detection at the      two-dimensional positions on the object sampled in the one timing is      displayed on the display 112, superimposed on the visible image date      concerning the wiring configuration of the object stored previously in the      memory. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
