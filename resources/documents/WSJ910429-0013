The conservator, the Resolution Trust Corp., thus becomesthe third federal agency to take a whack at selling thetroubled entity, which was formed in 1988 from the remains ofsome of Texas's most notorious thrifts. Among the potentialbidders is expansion-minded BankAmerica Corp.</LP><TEXT>   An RTC spokesman said the agency won't be able to assessthe cost of resolving Sunbelt until a buyer is found for thethrift, which will now be called Sunbelt Federal Savings FSB.   But the cost clearly will be in the billions of dollars.During almost three years as a government foundling, Sunbelthas received more than $1.47 billion in governmentassistance. Much of that assistance was to cover Sunbelt'slosses on the troubled property and real estate loans itinherited from the eight failed thrifts from which it wasformed. The government assistance will be stripped from theinstitution before it is sold, an RTC official said lastweek.   Sunbelt was created under the Federal Savings andamp; LoanInsurance Corp.'s Southwest Plan, under which scores offailed thrifts in the region were combined and sold toprivate buyers. The now-defunct FSLIC sold 15 other SouthwestPlan institutions, with substantial government assistance,but was unable to unload Sunbelt.   After the FSLIC was dissolved in August 1989, the FederalDeposit Insurance Corp. picked up responsibility for Sunbeltand elicited some interest from potential buyers. The FDICeven sweetened the pot last year when it allowed Sunbelt toacquire $2.1 billion in deposits and a valuable network ofbranches from two insolvent San Antonio, Texas, thrifts.   FDIC officials couldn't be reached for comment late Fridayon why their sales efforts fell through.   Sunbelt was one of five thrifts left unsold after theflurry of government deals in 1988. The other four were allin Oklahoma, and three of those are now in conservatorship.On Friday, the RTC took control of Red River Federal Savingsandamp; Loan in Lawton, Okla., which has $449.6 million in assets;a federal mutual association was created to assume RedRiver's $397.2 million in deposits as well as certain assetsand liabilities. A week earlier, the agency took control ofChisholm Federal Savings andamp; Loan, a $159.6 million thriftbased in Kingfisher, Okla., and Cimarron Federal Savings andamp;Loan, based in Muskogee, Okla., with $782.7 million inassets.   Separately, in Washington, the Office of ThriftSupervision declared John Hanson Savings Bank insolvent andplaced it under the control of the RTC.   The Beltsville, Md., bank will continue to operate undergovernment direction. It has deposits of $671.8 million in73,839 accounts. Accounts will remain insured up to the$100,000 limit. Former Hanson shareholders will have nointerest in the new thrift, which will open under the name ofJohn Hanson Federal Savings Bank.</TEXT></DOC>
