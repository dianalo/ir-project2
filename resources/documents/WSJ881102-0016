Most of the utilities said they will offset the suspension by increasing imports from Canada and Australia of enriched uranium, which is used as fuel for nuclear power plants.    The utilities said the suspension reflects encouragement from the Tokyo government for Japanese companies to exercise discretion in dealing with South Africa because of that country's apartheid policy of racial segregation. Namibia is occupied by South Africa.    Japan last year replaced the U.S. as South Africa's No. 1 trading partner, prompting increased international pressure on Tokyo from critics of apartheid. Recent trade figures show that Japan's trade with South Africa is declining.    The four Japanese utilities are Tohoku Electric Power Co., Kansai Electric Power Co., Chubu Electric Power Co. and Kyushu Electric Power Co. The suspension affects two uranium suppliers -- RTZ Corp., which is based in Britain and has a uranium mine in Namibia, and South Africa's national company Nafcoal.    RTZ's chairman, Sir Alastair Frame, declined to comment, saying he wasn't aware of the announcement by the Japanese utilities.    Meanwhile, a spokesman for Tokyo Electric Power Co., Japan's largest electric power provider, said his company is still studying the situation. </TEXT></DOC>
