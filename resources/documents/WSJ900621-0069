Naziart, the documentary notes, drew from the styles of theperiod, in a sinister wedding of ideology and fashion.Repeats at midnight. (Part two airs Sunday July 1, 8-9 p.m.and repeats at midnight.)                                                                                                          Monday, June 25, 8-9 p.m. EDT, on PBS: &quot;The Struggle forDemocracy -- An Update.&quot; Host Patrick Watson conductsinterviews with citizens and government officials in Poland,the Soviet Union and Romania.                                                                                                          Monday, June 25, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on ABC: &quot;All-Star ProSports Awards.&quot; This first annual ceremony will name thepublic's choices for athlete of the year in baseball,basketball, boxing, football, golf, ice hockey, horse racing,tennis and auto racing. Winners were chosen by ballots mailedor phoned in by fans. Stars of Hollywood and television --Clint Eastwood, John Candy, Arnold Schwarzenegger and such --will be making guest appearances at this ceremony, theproducers of which hope to make it an annual event on theorder of the Oscars. If only in the interest of socialresponsibility, they should consider putting this particularambition aside. The prospect of yet another annual rite ofcongratulation, another parade of winners discoursinglengthily on the thanks owed to family, coaches, longtimecompanions and astrologers is almost as chilling as thepossibility of Oscar-style political manifestoes delivered byjocks. This year, at least, intentional hilarity will beprovided by the awards emcee, comic Richard Lewis.                                                                                                          Monday, June 25, 9-11 p.m. EDT, on PBS: &quot;Firing LineSpecial Debate.&quot; &quot;A United Germany: Anything to Worry About?&quot;Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger discusses thepossible rise of the Fourth Reich with former TreasurySecretary William Simon, British Member of Parliament RoyHattersley, U.S. Ambassador to West Germany Vernon Walters,International Herald Tribune editor John Vinocur and, ofcourse, William F. Buckley Jr.                                                                                                          Tuesday, June 26, 9-10 EDT, on PBS: &quot;Giving Up the Canal.&quot;One participant in this documentary calls it &quot;our moon shotof the early 1900s.&quot; The building of the Panama Canal was infact a triumph of American achievement. Where the French hadbeen defeated by the jungle and the mosquitoes, the Americansprevailed and built the canal. In 1977, the Carteradministration agreed to treaties that will give the canal toPanama in the year 2000. This somewhat deceptively titledfilm, narrated by the always reassuring Edwin Newman,provides riveting material on the digging of the canal, andwhat it calls &quot;the U.S. city-state&quot; in Panama. But all toosoon, history is cast aside in favor of talkiness, mostlytalkiness of a familiar, if not absolutely mindnumbing, kindabout the failures of our Latin American policy.                                                                                                          Wednesday, June 27, 9-10:30 p.m. EDT, on PBS: &quot;AmericanPlayhouse&quot; this time out offers Tom Kempinski's aptly named&quot;Separation,&quot; the story of a romance begun under what are,you will admit, daunting circumstances. An emotionallycrippled British playwright and an American actress afflictedwith a rare neurological disease face up to the challenge oflove. Even people without this duo's fundamental disabilitieswould find it challenging to conduct an amorous relationshipentirely via transatlantic telephone.                                                                                                          Wednesday, July 4, 8:05-9:35 EDT, on TBS: &quot;Festival atFord Theater.&quot; There is but one reason to watch this: theremarkable performance of presidential impersonator JimMorris as he captures George Bush's preppy persona perfectly,with an admirable touch of spleen. Encore Tuesday, July 10,12:35-2:a.m.                                                                                                          Wednesday, July 4, 9-10 p.m. EDT, on Aandamp;E: The firstinstallment of a new 17-part documentary series, &quot;The WarYears,&quot; to be continued on subsequent Wednesdays. The WorldWar II footage is extraordinary and mostly unfamiliar, editedso as to concentrate in almost leisurely fashion on details.The result is a harrowing, suspenseful close-up of the war,and the preparation for it. The first chapter, dealing withthe Nazi staging of the invasion of Poland, and then, theonslaught itself, provides a lingering last look at theWarsaw that was. It is history as it should be told. It is,above all, history that should not be missed.</TEXT></DOC>
