Student leaders at a rally said they would lead the march to theborder truce site of Panmunjom on June 10 to meet with North Koreanstudents and work to reunify with the communist north.   ``Let's go and meet the northern people after driving out allforeign forces,'' a speaker said as students cheered and clapped.   Speakers repeatedly denounced the United States, claiming thatWashington enforces the partition of the Korean peninsula and rulesthe south as a colony. The campus was adorned with giant picturesof students destroying U.S. flags and routing U.S. troops.   ``Yankee go home'' and ``Go to Panmunjom,'' the 3,000 studentsfrom various colleges shouted in the rally at Kyonghee University.   South Korean authorities have warned that the students will notbe allowed to march to the border. The border is heavilymilitarized, and off-limits to civilians.   About 50 students hurling firebombs and shouting anti-Americanslogans clashed very briefly with riot police at Dankook Universityin Seoul before being driven back by tear gas. But the country wasreported quiet today with peaceful demonstrations on most campuses.   The South Korean government announced earlier today that itwanted to open new high-level talks with North Korea on the OlympicGames and other issues dividing the two nations.   South Korean Prime Minister Lee Hyun-jae made the proposal in aletter addressed to his North Korean counterpart, Lee Gun Mo. Theletter was read by Information Minister Chung Han-mo on radio.   In other developments, Japanese officials said the United Stateshas asked the Soviet Union to urge North Korea to exerciserestraint during the Olympic Games this September.   And authorities at Seoul's Kimpo International Aiport and KoreanAir were on the lookout today for four alleged Japanese radicals,following a tipoff from American law enforcement officials.   In the letter, Lee said South Korea wanted to talk to NorthKorea to ``speedily dispel the mistrust that is now standing in theway of peaceful unification.''   But South Korean officials said North Korea refused to acceptLee's letter.   Radical students have been demanding immediate reunfication ofthe two Koreas. Student leaders say they want North Korean studentsto march to meet them June 10 and destroy the border.   The radicals contend the United States is reponsible for thepartition of the peninsula since 1945. They have been demandingwithdrawal of the 42,000 U.S. troops based in South Korea.   South Korea has been hit by a wave of violent anti-governmentand anti-U.S. protests during the past three weeks with radicalstudents fighting riot police in Seoul and other cities.   Most South Koreans oppose the communist north under the one-manrule of Kim Il Sung and fear any moves by the north to take overthe south. The north invaded the south in 1950, sparking the KoreanWar.   Most South Koreans are thought to support the U.S. militarypresence as a defense against the north.   But reunification is an emotional issue for all Koreans and hasbeen increasingly debated in recent months. Reunification tended tobe a taboo subject in the south under past authoritariangovernments, but President Roh Tae-woo has lifted most restrictionson discussion.   In Tokyo, meanwhile, Japanese defense officials said the UnitedStates had asked the Soviet Union to urge North Korea to exerciserestraint during the Olympics.   Japanese defense officials learned of the request from U.S.Secretary of Defense Frank C. Carlucci, who arrived in Japan for avisit after attending the superpower summit in Moscow.   Korean Air officials said the FBI told KAL's office in New Yorkon Thursday that four men linked to an alleged Japanese Red Armymember being held in New York might try to slip into South Korea tosabotage the Games.   They said the names of the four men were obtained by the FBIwhile interrogating Yu Kikumura, 35, who was arrested April 13 inNew Jersey after police reportedly found three bombs in his car.   The revolutionary Japanese group is suspected of links withcommunist North Korea. South Korea fears the North may stageterrorist attacks to disrupt the Games.</TEXT></DOC>
