The resistivity variations werefound to be consistent with irradiation-enhanced local ordering. Pureexponential kinetics were followed in the last part of the approach toequilibrium. The saturation values of the electrical resistivity, togetherwith results obtained during annealing of unirradiated or low temperatureirradiated samples, were used to obtain the temperature dependence ofthe contribution of local order to the residual electrical resistivityover the temperature range 400 K to 870 K.</TEXT></DOC>
