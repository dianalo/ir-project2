Turkish officials are concerned that Saddam Hussein, afterattacking Iraq's rebelling Kurdish minority, now isdeliberately driving huge numbers of them across the border.Officials fear that as many as one million Kurds could beforced into Turkey and possibly a greater number into Iran,overwhelming all international relief efforts. There isconcern these Kurds would remain in permanent but primitiverefugee camps like the one here, on the Iraq-Turkey border,much as Palestinians have remained in Mideast camps fordecades.</LP><TEXT>   According to a U.S. official, the Turks worry that thiscould create &quot;a national-security nightmare&quot; in which therefugees would add to the ranks of Turkey's 20 million Kurds,many of whom have also been pressing for some form ofautonomy. The official says Turkey also is concerned that itwill be blamed for poor conditions at the refugee camps, muchas it was faulted after taking in an earlier wave of IraqiKurds in 1988.   As a result, while Mr. Baker talked here about the need toincrease international assistance for the refugees, Turkishofficials are far more concerned about finding ways to returnthe Kurds to Iraq.   In a statement before his departure from Turkey, Mr. Bakersaid, &quot;Hope of returning home has got to be given to thesepeople. And that means freedom from threat by the Iraqigovernment, and safety from further repression.&quot; But the Bushadministration has said it won't intervene in Iraq's internalaffairs to assure that result.   Separately, European Community leaders, meeting at aspecial summit in Luxembourg, called for the establishment ofa &quot;safe haven&quot; inside Iraq where the Kurds could live inpeace. The EC, expressing outrage at the brutal treatment ofthe Kurds by Iraqi forces, also put together a package ofabout $180 million in humanitarian aid to help the refugees.   Details of the safe-haven proposal will have to be workedout at the United Nations. Britain and France, acting for theEC, will ask the U.N. secretary-general to set up a region innorthern Iraq where about 1.5 million Kurdish refugees couldstay until it was safe to return to their homes. The EC hopesthat most of the U.N. observers who would oversee the areainside Iraq could be non-military personnel. But if Iraqrefuses to allow the establishment of such a zone, severalcountries, including Britain and the Netherlands, said theywouldn't rule out the use of force to establish it.   The three other members of the U.N. Security Council wouldhave to agree before the proposal could be implemented.British Prime Minister John Major, who proposed the protectedzone, said the initial U.S. reaction had been supportive. Thetwo other permanent members, China and the Soviet Union, willlikely have to be persuaded to go along, Mr. Major said.   The camps that Mr. Baker visited are in isolated borderareas and lack any facilities. One, the Uzumla refugee camp,is several yards across the mountainous border with Iraq. SoMr. Baker -- without realizing it, according to an aide --became the first senior U.S. official to set foot in Iraq indecades.   Mr. Baker's stop in Turkey was arranged quickly last week,as the administration was being pounded by critics forignoring the mounting refugee problem.   Thousands of Kurds stood watching quietly on the steephills where many have pitched tents as Mr. Baker made a stopof less than 10 minutes before being hustled away by nervousTurkish security guards.   With television cameras focused on him, one refugee toldMr. Baker: &quot;We are suffering. Our children are suffering fromstarvation. We need doctors. We need medicine. We needwater.&quot;   Mr. Baker responded by noting that &quot;we have a majorairlift going&quot; that has begun dropping food and othersupplies to fleeing refugees, mostly in Iraq. The U.S. beganthe airlift over the weekend and announced an emergency aidprogram Friday in response to the domestic criticism. As Mr.Baker hurried off, many of the refugees applauded him.   But several Kurdish refugees, in interviews with reporterswho accompanied Mr. Baker, blamed their plight on the U.S.Isa Mohammed, who arrived at the camp after a 10-day trek,said that &quot;Bush called on the Iraqi people to rise up againstSaddam Hussein&quot; but then &quot;he didn't support us.&quot;   Another recent arrival, Noori Briefkani, criticized theU.S. for not pursuing the war until Saddam Hussein was drivenfrom power. &quot;If they continued the war for two more days,they could have finished it,&quot; he said.   ---   Mark M.
