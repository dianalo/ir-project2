<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-81-1145 </DOCNO><TEXT>The present work consisted of preliminary measurements of the basic physicalparameters such as the wide range of energy of the electron beam available,the radiation output for various combinations of electron energy - andscatter foil, the percentage depth dose curves for these beams, theirbeam flatness and stability, from the Siemens 42 MeV Betatron. For oneof the scatter foils, the thickness determined by attenuation measurementsdiffered from the stated value by about 200 per cent. The radiation outputfor the electron beams in the range of 300-500 R/mt is very convenientand enable reduction of the time of treatment per field to less thana minute. This enhances patient comfort and patient turnover. The stabilityof the electron beams is extremely good; the treatment could be reproducedday after day without any difficulty. The measurements confirm that thephysical characteristics of the high energy electron beams are suitablefor cancer treatment. (author). 12 refs., 2 tables, 4 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
