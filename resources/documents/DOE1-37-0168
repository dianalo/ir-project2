However, theconverse is false, even if V is Rsup(n). The situation is quite differentfor spacelike hypersurfaces in Lorentz manifolds. It is shown that forf:Msup(n) -andgt; Lsup(n + 1), a spacelike immersion into Minkowski space,if f induces a complete metric on M then f(M) is closed; indeed, f isan embedding, and f(M) is an achronal graph over any spacelike hyperplane.Conversely, it is shown that for Vsup(n + 1) a b-complete Lorentz manifoldand f:Msup(n) -andgt; Vsup(n + 1), a spacelike immersion with bounded principalcurvatures, if f is proper then it induces a complete metric on M.</TEXT></DOC>
