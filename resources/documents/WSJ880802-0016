Unit Through Stock Swap </HL><SO> </SO><CO> WNEWS ITT </CO><IN> TNM </IN><DATELINE> RICHMOND, Va.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Wheat, First Securities Inc. has agreed to acquire Butcher andamp; Singer Inc., a Philadelphia-based investment banking and brokerage firm, through stock swap.    The privately held companies didn't disclose the financial terms of the acquisition. But John McElroy, chief executive officer of Wheat, First, said Butcher andamp; Co., the sole owner of Butcher andamp; Singer, will receive 550,000 shares, or an 18% interest, in Wheat, First. Butcher will also receive incremental cash payments, based on the future combined earnings of the two brokerage firms.    Perrin Long, a securities industry analyst with Lipper Analytical Services Corp. in New York, estimated that Wheat, First might have paid anywhere between 1.3 and 1.4 times net worth for Butcher andamp; Singer. He said that was the going rate for two other regional brokerage firm acquisitions in recent weeks.    Butcher andamp; Singer had equity capital of $17.4 million at year-end 1987. Using Mr. Long's estimate, Wheat, First might have paid between $22.6 million and $24.4 million for Butcher andamp; Singer.    While the capital of the companies will be pooled and the back office operations consolidated, they will operate as separate units of a newly formed holding company, WBF Securities Inc. WBF will have $56 million in capital, about 750 brokers and offices in 92 locations in states from Massachusetts to South Carolina.    &quot;We wanted to maintain the strengths of our regional identities,&quot; said Mr. McElroy, who has been elected chairman and chief executive of the new holding company.    McBee Butcher, chairman and chief executive of Butcher andamp; Singer, will be vice chairman. Marshall Wishnack, Wheat, First president and chief operating officer, has been named to the same post in WBF. Butcher will continue its independent merchant banking activities.    Hartford Life andamp; Accident Co., a unit of ITT Corp., will own 21% of Wheat, First, down from 24% after Butcher received shares for the brokerage firm sale. </TEXT></DOC>
