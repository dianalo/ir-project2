The measure, which faces opposition from influential House members, calls for $100 million a year to be paid to the state that hosts an underground storage site for tons of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste.    Despite the potential payoff, no states are volunteering. In fact, Sen. Bennett Johnston (D., La.), picked up crucial support for his winning nuclear-waste proposal with promises to suspend the search for a second dump site in the East or upper Midwest for more than 20 years.    Mr. Johnston's proposal is the most aggressive plan now under consideration on Capitol Hill for reviving the nation's nuclear-waste program, which is mired in controversy. The nuclear-waste provision is part of a bill allocating an estimated $15.96 billion to energy and water programs.    A final vote on the entire bill could come next week. And while amendments to the nuclear-waste provision are possible, they're not likely to change it substantially.    Three sites are the finalists for the first permanent storage site: Deaf Smith County, Texas; Hanford, Wash., and Yucca Mountain in a corner of the Nevada atomic test site. Mr. Johnston's measure would change the current program and provide for expensive underground testing of just one of those sites, to be named in January 1989. Mr. Johnston, chairman of the Senate Energy Committee, said that $3.9 billion would be saved by sinking a shaft to test one site instead of three.    Opponents, led by Democratic Sens. Brock Adams of Washington and Harry Reid of Nevada, called the procedure unscientific and said it wouldn't save money, especially if the first test site proved unsatisfactory.    Although Nevada isn't mentioned by name as the prime spot for a nuclear-waste dump, many observers said the criteria in the measure may disqualify other finalists. &quot;There's a lot of code language&quot; in the bill, warned Sen. Alan Simpson (R., Wyo.), who voted against it. &quot;This is going to be a Nevada site. That's what you've got there.&quot;    Tennessee also is vulnerable. The Energy Department has picked three sites in Tennessee, with Oak Ridge first on the list, for a temporary storage facility to hold and repackage spent nuclear fuel rods.    Fears are that a temporary site, favored by the nuclear industry, could become the permanent storage site because it would be built first. However, Sen. James Sasser (D., Tenn.) voted with Sen. Johnston after striking a compromise to reopen the issue of where to place a temporary site and whether it's needed.    Although the full House hasn't adopted a nuclear-waste strategy, the House Interior Committee led by influential Chairman Morris Udall (D., Ariz.) has voted to freeze the search for a dump site for 18 months until the Energy Department's controversial siting procedures can be studied and revamped. There is expected to be an attempt to strip Mr. Johnston's measure from the appropriations bill during a House and Senate conference. </TEXT></DOC>
