High temperature batteriessuch as sodium/sulfur exhibit alluring and unrivaled power and energydensities but unfortunately are plagued by corrosion problems. A decreasein the operating temperature from 350{sup 0}C to the 110 to 150{sup 0}Ctemperature range resulted in a simplified cell technology allowing forthe use of polymeric seals. The non-aggressive nature of the positiveelectrode lessened also considerably the corrosion issues. A tetraethylthiuramdisulfide/diethyldithiocarbamate cell was first investigated becauseof its attractive theoretical energy density of 360 Wh/kg and becauseof the low melting point of the diethyldithiocarbamate sodium salt (145{sup0}C), condition necessary to maintain the electrode in the liquid state.(Sodium and Beta&quot; Alumina were respectively the negative electrode andthe solid electrolyte). The low melting sodium salt requirement can beadvantageously replaced by the use of a solvent in charge of solubilizingthe sodium salt generated during discharged. Low viscosity and high dielectricconstant were identified as two key factors in the solvent optimization.The addition of 20% in weight of dimethyl sulfoxide or of sulfolane permittedthe cell charge and discharge at 5 mA/cm{sup 2} at 130{sup 0}C. Peakcurrent densities of 100 mA/cm{sup 2} at 1 Volt were also obtained. Theperspectives opened by solvent addition, led to the concept of &quot;electroactivesolvent&quot; where the electroactive material itself solvates the sulfidesodium salt. In this respect, the alkoxyalkyl disulfides are promisingcandidates because of their combined low viscosity, high energy densityand thermal stability. 42 refs., 47 figs., 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
