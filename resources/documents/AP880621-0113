High temperatures today will be in the 90s across most of thenation, the National Weather Service said. Temperatures didn't havefar to go on the Plains, with the overnight low at a warm 77 atBismarck, N.D.   Nearly 40 cities in the central and eastern United States settemperature records Monday as the early-season heat continued tointensify, according to the weather service.   Temperatures soared above 100 degrees across much of thenorthern and central Plains, the upper Mississippi Valley and thedesert Southwest. Highs in the 90s were common elsewhere across thenation except for coastal and mountain areas.   Authorities in several areas opened up shelters Monday toresidents without air conditioners. In Chicago, where it reached104, city officials invited the public to use the city's librariesand other air-conditoned municipal buildings during daytime hoursto escape the heat. The Chicago temperature reading tied the recordfor the month of June.   Customers of Chicago's Commonwealth Edison Co. set a single-dayrecord for electricity usage, said spokesman John Hogan, whileConsumers Power Co. in Michican set a usage record for the month.   The heat caused discomfort for people with breathingdifficulties and heart conditions and prompted authorities in theChicago area and in Wisconsin to post ozone advisories, cautioningpeople with those conditions to remain in air-conditioned rooms.   The heat also proved dangerous to animals. Forecasters said thelivestock weather safety index entered the emergency zone inseveral parts of Midwest and Plains. Farmers were advised to keepanimals in shade and provide plenty of water.   ``Animals react to the heat in the same way humans do,'' saidMichigan Department of Agriculture specialist Edwin Renkie. ``Itdoes affect the animals and in some cases can kill them.''   Heat distorted railroad tracks in Mobridge, S.D., last weekend,causing five cars of a Burlington Northern train loaded with cornto derail, said spokesman Al Wiegold in St. Paul, Minn.   During the weekend, the heat in the Sioux Falls, S.D., area alsocaused 25 roads to buckle, about the usual damage for the entiresummer, said Delmer Van Ekern of the state TransportationDepartment.   In Des Moines, searing heat buckled pavement Sunday, slowingtraffic on U.S. 6 and Interstate 235. On Monday, Des Moines' highreached 101, breaking the 98-degree reading set for the date in1933.   Also Monday, Concordia, Kan., reached 106, breaking the103-degree record of 1952; Sheridan, Wyo., went to 102 degrees,topping the 100-degree mark of 1940; Madison, Wis., recorded 101degrees, topping the record for the date of 97 also set during the1933 Dust Bowl drought.   Temperature records also were broken in Michigan, Montana,Vermont, Ohio, Missouri, North and South Dakota, Nebraska,Minnesota and Illinois, the weather service said.   Agricultural experts said the heat is adding to the problems ofthe drought in the Midwest and the Plains by evaporating whatlittle moisture remains in the soil.   ``These real hot days _ 95 to 100 degrees _ are using moremoisture than we can stand to lose,'' said Harold Hunzicker,agricultural adviser in Marion County in southern Illinois. ``We'restill hanging in there, but that is not to say we couldn't have adisaster.''   Tom Vigil, a heavy equipment operator in Denver who spends eightto 12 hours a day laying drainage pipe, had this advice for stayingcool: ``Think about Santa Claus.''</TEXT></DOC>
