Have they no shame? Where is Alex Cockburn when we need him? Mr. Cockburn, a connoisseur of old cars and older ideas, has spent his summer in the Journal huffing and puffing about Singapore and Nicaragua while the summer's biggest mini-story lies untended -- the battle over &quot;Revolution.&quot;    &quot;Revolution&quot; is the classic 1968 Beatles song (actually they're all classics), which Michael Jackson sold to Nike shoes, which turned it into a TV commercial. With John Lennon singing in the background about how you wanna revolution, the people on screen are running and leaping through the air, clad in Nike sneakers, mainly revolutionizing their personal best on an athletic field.    You could bomb Mecca, blow up St. Peter's, dynamite the Washington Monument, wash your car with the American flag, burn the Magna Carta, sack Jerusalem, throw eggs at Graceland and (maybe) admit publicly that you prefer Julian to John Lennon. But sell sneakers with &quot;Revolution&quot;? This is sacrilege!    The Beatles' record company is suing. Michael Jackson is sounding regretful. Nike has become ground zero for the rock press.    You've got to understand; the counterculture was a religion. It wasn't just fun, like the '50s, or people dancing, like the '30s and '40s. It was a theological experience, a movement (as in &quot;a movement person&quot;). Like most religions, it has music. To our knowledge, however, no one has ever tried to sell anything with Gregorian chant. &quot;Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring&quot; has been moving the masses for more than 200 years, but chances are no one will try to move Chevy trucks with it. Not so the poor counterculture. Madison Avenue is tearing down the temple.    This is not to ignore the fact that the old church was chock-a-block with money-changers. One of the continuing ironies of the period that lasted from the Beatles' first appearance on &quot;Ed Sullivan&quot; to the last helicopter lifting off the roof of the U.S. Embassy in Saigon was that it sold a lot of records. Somehow all that anger at war, conformity and capitalism turned musicians into plutocrats who lived in castles, drank Jack Daniel's like Cherry Coke and bought airplanes to play in.    Still, we feel that the faithful who are wailing that &quot;Revolution&quot; was the song they were singing when the cops clubbed them in Madison may be overreacting. For one thing, it's a neat commercial. The woman who made it calls it &quot;a kind of radical sports documentary.&quot; Also, it features Michael Jordan, who a hundred years from now may be a greater historical figure than John Lennon (who could sing but had no hang time).    The counterculture's curia should conserve its panic. We'll know the days of wrath are upon us when:    Dylan's &quot;Blowin' in the Wind&quot; is selling a shampoo called Blowin' in the Wind, CSNandamp;Y's &quot;Carry On&quot; is selling Samsonite, White Rabbit is a bathroom cleanser, Purple Haze is a wine cooler, Ball and Chain is a restaurant in SoHo, and Yoko Ono goes on the Miller Lite camp out. </TEXT></DOC>
