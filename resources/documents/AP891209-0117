Gysi promised that the Communists are willing to enter into agovernment coalition with other parties after free electionsproposed for May.   He also said the party is abandoning its claim to absolute ruleand held up a huge janitor's broom, symbolizing his determinationto make a clean sweep and start anew.   Gysi, 41, a bespectacled, blunt-talking intellectual, is theyoungest Communist Party chief in Eastern Europe. He was chosenduring a 17-hour emergency party congress that started Friday night.   After the election, reformist Premier Hans Modrow set up acommission to study an overhaul of the nation's increasinglytroubled economy, plagued by slow growth, consumer productshortages and a foreign debt of $20.6 billion.   Gysi called the party's problems ``insanely complicated,''despite promises of new ideas, new personnel and more democraticideas.   The party chairman also cautioned the more than 2,700 delegatesat the party congress that there ``aren't any miracles.''   Miracles may be what is needed for the Communists, who wereholding what almost certainly will be their last session as thecountry's ruling force.   Party officials disclosed Tuesday that 500,000 members had quitsince September, more than twice the previously published figure.   That brings the membership to less than 1.8 million, seriouslyweakening the force that held an iron-fisted sway over East Germanyfor four decades.   The Communists also have lost their monopoly on power inCzechoslovakia, where formation of the first government notdominated by Communists was announced Saturday.   In the Soviet Union, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told theCommunist leadership he is ready to modify or abandon the party'sconstitutional monopoly on power but only as part of sweepingpolitical reforms.   With seven former Politburo members in jail and some oustedleaders charged with corruption, the East German Communistssquarely faced up to the abuses of the past.   The first section of a report approved by the delegates issuedan apology, saying the former leadership ``had led our country intothis crisis threatening its existence.''   ``We are willing to make amends,'' the report said.   The delegates decided to change the party's name later this weekbut voted against disbanding altogether. They also voted tostreamline the leadership.   Gysi, one of East Berlin's most prominent lawyers, infuriatedhard-line rulers in October by representing the New Forumopposition group in its bid to become a legal organization.   After weeks of trying amid growing tumult, the 200,000-strongNew Forum gained legal recognition needed to avoid officialsuppression.   After his election, Gysi pledged to work for democraticsocialism, a term that has become increasingly popular among thecountry's reformers, both within the Communist Party and outsideit. He said the Communists would be ``one party among others.''   He pledged to continue the break with the abuses of hard-lineStalinism but also said the country has no intention of adoptingcapitalism, and he repeated his opposition to reunification of theGermanys.   More than 6,000 people, some of them East Germans, took part ina demonstration late Saturday in West Berlin to protest growingcalls for reunification.   Several West German politicians reacted skeptically to theCommunist Party meeting. Volker Ruehe, the general secretary ofChancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats, repeated hisassertion that the East German Communist Party has failed despitethe new chairman.   The Communists have lost much of their control in recent weeksand have granted historic concessions to the opposition, includingopening the Berlin Wall and other borders, in a desperate effort toremain in power.   Long-time party leader Erich Honecker was ousted from power Oct.18 as tens of thousands of East Germans fled West and thousandsmore took to the streets to demand democratic reforms. He is nowunder house arrest and charged with corruption and abuse of power.   Egon Krenz took over from Honecker and introduced reforms, suchas opening the borders, but his long-time association with theHonecker regime forced his ouster last week.   The 10-member Politburo and 163-member Central Committeeresigned at the same time, and a 25-member panel of reformers wasnamed to run party affairs until the weekend congress.   Gysi, whose father is Jewish, served until last year as thestate secretary for religious affairs, a high-ranking post.   Party spokeswoman Brigitte Zimmermann, briefing reporters on theclosed session of the emergency congress, said Gysi was the onlycandidate to become the party's third leader in less than twomonths.   The official news agency ADN said 95.3 percent of the 2,714delegates participating voted for Gysi in balloting that took 5{hours.   In a secret ballot, delegates also chose other members in a new100-member party leadership over which Gysi will preside.   Gysi has backed sweeping political and economic reforms. He wasa member of the interim party leadership and is heading a committeeinvestigating corruption under the ousted leadership.   Gysi is an avid supporter of Soviet President Mikhail S.Gorbachev's glasnost policy of a more open and free society. At aNov. 4 rally of about 1 million in East Berlin's Alexander Platz, alarge square in the city center, Gysi said that ``glasnost belongsin the German vocabulary.''</TEXT></DOC>
