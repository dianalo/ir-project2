Boos and sardonic laughter punctuated a meeting of more than2,000 of the 17,600-member Seattle Professional EngineeringEmployees Association, Boeing's second-largest union.   The union has never struck and lacks a strike fund. But manymembers carried signs and some distributed leaflets calling forcontract rejection and a walkout at the world's largest commercialjet builder.   Also Sunday, a contract similar to one accepted by theMachinists union was ratified by United Aerospace Workers Local1069. The pact covers about 3,000 workers at Boeing Helicopters atRidley Township, Pa., near Philadelphia, and is retroactive to Oct.5.   The Machinists' settlement, which followed the longest strikeagainst Boeing in 41 years, provided ``the economic guidelines thatwe could follow,'' said Robert Torgerson of Boeing Helicopters.   At the Seattle Center Coliseum, hooting was loudest when unionpresident Charles Bofferding emphasized that negotiators hadn'tmade a recommendation.   ``Take a stand!'' several people shouted.   Ballots were mailed to members' homes Friday, along with 30-pagebooklets listing all changes from the three-year pacts that expiredDec. 1 but were extended indefinitely as talks continued. The votecount is set for Dec. 18.   One three-year offer covers 15,000 scientists and engineers. Theother is for 12,800 technical support workers, with almost allmembers of both units in the Puget Sound area.   Engineers and scientists, who earn an average of nearly $40,000a year, would get a 4 percent wage increase and a productivitybonus of 10 percent of gross pay in the first year but no furtherincreases.   Technicians, with average pay of about $28,000, would get annualincreases of 3 percent, 2 percent and 2 percent and bonuses of 10percent, 5 percent and 4 percent.   The three-year contract for Boeing's Machinists included annualwage increases of 4, 3 and 3 percent; bonuses of 10, 5 and 4percent of gross pay and an improvement in the cost-of-livingformula from about 83 percent of inflation to nearly 100 percent.   The outcome of the voting is anyone's guess, Bofferding saidafter the meeting.   ``I believe, though, the general response of our people to thewage proposal is fairly negative,'' he added.   ``There's a reasonably good chance that the members would notaccept the contract, based on the mood tonight,'' said negotiatorRichard Van Guilder of the technicians' unit.   Chief corporate spokesman Harold Carr said it was unfair tocompare the Machinists' contract, which covers 57,800 workers, tooffers to the engineers and technicians was unfair.   ``The problem is when you try to compare a professional to a guysweeping the factory floor. That is not legitimate,'' Carr said.</TEXT></DOC>
