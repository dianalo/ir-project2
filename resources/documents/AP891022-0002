No new negotiation sessions were scheduled as the strike by57,800 machinists nationwide enters its 20th day.   Boeing chairman Frank Shrontz was scheduled to speak Monday to aselect group of media and business leaders on ``The Boeing Strike:The Inside Story.'' The meeting before the Seattle Chamber ofCommerce Community Development Roundtable will be closed and noneof the comments can be published.   Karen Keiser, communications director of the Washington StateLabor Council, said she objects that media leaders would agree tosuch a gathering.   ``These are the people who set the tone for news coverage, andthey're part of a secret group of the business leaders ofSeattle,'' she said. ``What kind of corporate dogma are theylearning in those meetings?''   The labor council and Machinists union scheduled their ownbriefing on the Boeing strike. Tom Baker, president of MachinistsDistrict Lodge 751, planned to talk to labor leaders in anon-the-record session open to the media and scheduled for the sametime as Shrontz's speech.   Steve Leahy, a Seattle Chamber of Commerce vice president andgroup secretary, said the off-the-record sessions permit speakersto talk candidly without fear their remarks will turn up inheadlines. The speakers' remarks often are the same as thosethey've already made in public forums, he said.   The group, founded in 1933 by The Seattle Times and the chamber,includes members from the Times, Seattle Post-Intelligencer andSeattle television stations KOMO, KING and KIRO.   Charles Dunsire, editorial page editor for thePost-Intelligencer and a member of the group, said he considers themeetings a valuable resource. He likened them to off-the-recordbriefings given occasionally to newspaper editoral boards.   ``If it were up to me, however, these meetings would be on therecord,'' Dunsire said.   A Wednesday negotiating session called by federal mediatorDouglas Hammond ended with no progress after several hours.</TEXT></DOC>
