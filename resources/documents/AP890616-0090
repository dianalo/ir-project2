Bush told a White House gathering of about 90 of the nation's 94U.S. attorneys to return to their states and enforce his policy ofno plea bargaining with violent, gun-wielding offenders.   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh gave the prosecutors a set ofwritten guidelines regarding plea bargaining for crimes involvingfirearms.   Thornburgh wrote: ``In all but exceptional cases such as those inwhich the defendant has provided subastantial assistance to thegovernment in the investigation or prosecution of crimes by others,federal prosecutors will seek conviction for any offense involvingthe unlawful use of a firearm which is readily provable.   Bush told the federal prosecutors they are ``the commanders atthe frontlines'' and urged them to help ``put away the nation's mostwanted.''   ``The situation in our streets has been aptly compared to ashooting war,'' he said, noting that many in the room might takeissue with statements that the country is at peace.   The president hammered home his view that criminals who use gunsin violent crimes should be prosecuted to the maximum extent.   ``This policy may mean more trials. ... firearms cases likenarcotics cases, are not always very popular with some on thebench,'' he acknowledged. ``But it can be done, and in fact alreadyis being done, even in districts with these overcrowded dockets....''   Bush said his proposals for more federal prosecutors,law-enforcement officers and new prison construction will help easethe overburdened criminal justice system.   Bush also emphasized the need cracking down on white collarcrime, calling for strict enforcement of laws against financial andbanking fraud, organized crime and civil rights violations.   ``Crime is crime whether committed with a briefcase or a gun. Wewill not tolerate greed over honest business,'' he said.   Bush on Thursday sent Congress the legislative draft of the $1.2billion anti-crime package which he outlined a moth ago.   But to dramatize his commitment to fighting drugs and violentcrime, Bush journeyed to the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centerin steamy Glynco, Ga., to sign the transmittal document.   Most of the money _ $1 billion _ would go to expand federalprison capacity, but Bush also is intent on hiring 1,600 newprosecutors to work under the U.S. attorneys, and 825 new federalagents.   The U.S. Treasury-run center in Georgia trains police andinvestigators from every federal law enforcement agency except theFBI and the Drug Enforcement Agency.   ``In a country where criminals threaten to erode the veryliberties we hold so dear, you are domestic freedom fighters in thewar on crime,'' Bush told trainees and several thousand othersgathered on a 90-degree day for the event.   Bush said he has instructed Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, whoaccompanied him to Georgia, ``to advise America's federalprosecutors to end plea bargaining for violent federal firearmsoffenses.   ``Our message to the common criminal is this: Pack a gun andwe'll pack you away,'' he said.   He exhorted Congress to enact his plan to double the mandatorypenalty for use of semi-automatic weapons in drug or violent crimesto 10 years.   But earlier, Bush advised a graduating Border Patrol officer,David Rivera, to remember that criminal suspects ``should be treatedwith respect and given his rights or her rights, even though theevidence looks overwhelming.''</TEXT></DOC>
