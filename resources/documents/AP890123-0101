He also told them to avoideven the appearance of conflict of interest.   On another subject, at mid-day the new president spoke toanti-abortion demonstrators in a special telephone hookup from theOval Office, telling them he shared their concern about ``ourAmerican tragedy, abortion on demand.''   He reiterated his support of a constitutional amendment barringmost abortions. ``I'm confident that more and more Americans everyyear, every day, are hearing your message and taking it to heart,''Bush told the demonstrators, who were preparing a protest march.   Earlier, Bush said, ``Let's go to work,'' as he presided at abrief ceremony in the East Room at which 65 White House staffmembers were sworn in by Vice President Dan Quayle.   Bush was to preside later in the day at his first Cabinet meeting.   His spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, meanwhile, said Japanese PrimeMinister Noboru Takeshita would meet with Bush in Washington on Feb.2 in what may be Bush's first meeting as president with a foreignhead of state.   Fitzwater said Bush invited Takeshita in order to demonstrate hisadministration's commitment to good U.S.-Japanese relations. Bushwill travel to Japan later in February to attend the funeral ofJapanese Emperor Hirohito.   Fitzwater also said that Bush might call Mikhail Gorbachev tothank him personally for the Soviet leader's congratulatory message.He said Bush had received over 30 such messages from foreign leaders.   Bush, in his meeting with staff members, stressed the importanceof maintaining a strict ethical code. Fitzwater said the presidentwould shortly set up a commission to propose ways of strengtheningethics laws governing both administration officials and members ofCongress.   Bush told his senior staff, ``It's not really very complicated.It's a question of knowing right from wrong, avoiding conflicts ofinterest, bending over backwards to see that there's no even aperception of a conflict of interest,'' the new president said.   ``Our actions must always be of the highest integrity.''   Bush addressed his staff at 8:30 a.m. By then, he had alreadybeen at work for more than an hour, meeting with Quayle at a 7:15a.m. breakast session and with chief of staff John Sununu.   The president indicated he expected a similar work schedule frommembers of his staff. He appealed for understanding from spouses whowatched the ceremony.   ``Your husbands and wives are embarking on an ordeal that isknown to be a time-consuming killer ... The lights burn well afterdark around this place,'' Bush said.   He said he expected ``long hours and hard work ... But these longhours can result in new opportunity for all.''   Bush reiterated that his top priority was tackling the budgetdeficit _ which he will focus on throughout the week, beginning witha meeting Tuesday with congressional leaders.   ``We have an immense opportunity to make life better for thepeople in this country,'' He said. ``We can, by hard work, make thisa safer and more secure country.''   Quayle had been asked by Bush to swear in the staff. He asked theaides to raise their right hands and take the oath to ``support anddefend the Constitution of the United States'' and to ``well andfaithfully discharge the duties of the office of which I am proud toenter.''   ``It's my first official act,'' Quayle quipped.   At one point, as the voices of children in the audience began torise, Bush interrupted his speech and joked: ``I'm glad they'resomeone else's kids.'' He hinted that having his 10 grandchildren inthe White House all weekend had been something of an ordeal. ``Inthe last 48 hours, they've been everywhere,'' he said.   Among those sworn in were national security adviser BrentScowcroft; David Bates Jr., secretary to the Cabinet; Richard C.Breeden, assistant for issues analysis; Andrew H. Card Jr., deputyto the chief of staff; David Demarest, communications director;Marlin Fitzwater, press secretary; C. Boyden Gray, counsel to thepresident; Frederick D. McClure, assistant for legislative affairs;and Roger B. Porter, assistant for domestic policy.   Sununu attended the ceremony but did not raise his right hand; hehad been sworn in by Quayle privately earlier today.   Bush was turning his attention to business after a $25 millioninaugural extravaganza.   He addressed the anti-abortion protesters who gathered on theEllipse, just south of the White House. The demonstration was calledto protest the Supreme Court's Jan. 22, 1973, decision legalizingabortion.   Reagan addressed the annual march and rally in the same fashionin previous years.   Bush opposed a constitutional amendment banning abortions when hefirst ran for president in 1980, but later changed his position.   In his 1988 presidential campaign, he voiced support for anamendment that would prohibit abortions except in cases of incest orrape or to save the life of the mother.   And, as recently as his inaugural address on Friday, Bush made apassing reference to the issue.   There, he spoke of ``young women to be helped who are about tobecome mothers of children they can't care for and might not love.They need our care, our guidance, and our education, though we blessthem for choosing life.''   Spokesman Fitzwater said Sunday the president will withholdspecifics on his budget plans until a Feb. 9 address to a jointsession of Congress. However, he plans to start the ball rolling onTuesday when he meets with congressional leaders.</TEXT></DOC>
