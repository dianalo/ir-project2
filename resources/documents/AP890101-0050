(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   More oil-covered sea birds were foundover the weekend in what revised Coast Guard estimates show was oneof the worst oil spills in Washington history.   Some 2,000 sea birds have died since Dec. 23, when a damagedbarge lost as much as 231,000 gallons of oil off Grays Harbor, stateDepartment of Wildlife spokesman Ron Holcomb said Sunday.   The dead birds include about 1,650 found on ocean beaches fromOregon and Washington, about 350 birds that were euthanized becauseof their poor condition, and some others that died at a birdcleaning center, Holcomb said.   Volunteers working daily since the spill have cleaned about 420birds and released a dozen, Holcomb said.   Oil globs washed ashore as far as the northern tip of the OlympicPeninsula, including national wildlife refuges stretching for about75 miles in Washington.   Cleanup crews Sunday focused mainly at La Push, about 70 milesnorth of where the spill occurred.   More than 2,000 live birds have been received at a cleanup centerat the Ocean Shores Convention Center, and hundreds of them stillneeded cleaning, Holcomb said.   The Coast Guard on Saturday revised its estimate of the spill andput the amount at 168,000 to 231,000 gallons, said Mark Stewart ofthe state Division of Emergency Management.   Washington state's previous largest oil spill occurred on Dec.21, 1985, when the ARCO Anchorage ran aground in Port Angeles harborand spilled about 239,000 gallons of crude. The oil polluted theStrait of Juan de Fuca, which separates the northern OlympiaPeninsula from Canada's Vancouver Island and leads from the PacificOcean to Puget Sound.</TEXT></DOC>
