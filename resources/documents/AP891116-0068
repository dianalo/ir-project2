SIMPSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Trying to keep pace with the changes sweepingEurope, the Italian Communist Party has taken a revolutionary stepof its own.   After months of debate, party leader Achille Occhetto has putthe machinery in motion to drop the word ``Communist'' from theparty name, eliminate the hammer and sickle from its symbol andpresent the skeleton as a new force grouping leftist parties.   Occhetto is hoping the change will reverse the party's saggingpolitical fortunes and end the stigma that has kept it out of thenational government for 42 years.   It is a gamble that could change the political map in a countrywhere one party, the Christian Democrats, has led or dominated allgovernments since the end of World War II.   ``Divisions among leftists have caused the permanent victory ofthe Christian Democrats,'' Occhetto said Wednesday.   But the move could also backfire and cost the Communist Partyits hardcore supporters, lead to a split in party ranks andstrengthen the Christian Democrats' No. 1 position.   ``The step taken by Achille Occhetto has unquestionablehistorical importance and like all moves of such nature carriesrisks, firstly that of losing somebody and something along theway,'' said Turin's moderate La Stampa newspaper in a front-pagecommentary.   In recent elections, the Communists have held on to their No. 2position but have dropped from the 34 percent of the vote theyreceived in 1976, when they came to the brink of power, to around27 percent. In the meantime, claimed membership has fallen fromsome 2 million in 1953 to less than 1.5 million.   Still, in a Europe that has seen ruling Soviet bloc Communistparties begin to crumble and the once powerful French party reducedto a small opposition role, Italy's Communists stand out as majorvote-getters.   The party has long pledged adherence to Western parliamentarydemocracy, criticized Moscow's military intervention inCzechoslovakia in 1968 and Afghanistan in 1979 and voiced itssupport for Italy's membership in NATO.   Successive U.S. administrations, however, have opposed theparty's participation in Italian government, expressing warinessover its stand on strategic issues.   The party opposed the installation of cruise nuclear missiles inItaly in a NATO initiative to counter a Soviet missile buildup andthe transfer to Italy of a squadron of U.S. fighter-bombers forcedto leave Spain.   Italian news agencies quoted U.S. Ambassador Peter Secchia astelling reporters during a visit to Bolgona on Wednesday that``changes are always welcome'' but that the proposed change of namewas an issue for the party and not the U.S. administration.   Occhetto made his formal proposal to a meeting of his party'sleadership on Tuesday, saying the party had to keep up with thechanges taking place in Europe or risk losing its ``specialidentity.''   In other words, there is no more political mileage for a partythat presents itself as a critic of international communism ifinternational communism fades away.   Occhetto's aim is to lure the smaller Socialist Party and otherleftist groups under one political banner, presenting itself as analternative to the Christian Democrats.   But the Socialists have been coalition partners of the ChristianDemocats for the past decade and it seems doubtful that partyleader Bettino Craxi would ally himself with another leftist partythat receives twice as many votes.   Craxi's ``long march'' strategy has been aimed at eventuallyovertaking the Communists to secure him leadership of the Italianleft.   Occhetto's plan will be considered by the 300-member CentralCommittee in the coming days and then probably submitted to anextraordinary congress for approval next year, perhaps beforespring municipal elections.   Occhetto said it was premature to come up with the new name butparty leaders have discussed a number of possibilities over thepast few months including ``Workers Party,'' ``Italian DemocraticParty'' and ``Party of the United Left.''</TEXT></DOC>
