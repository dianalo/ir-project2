Ernest Hollings stood in a Capitolcorridor talking about the meeting.   Interrupting the conversation, a bald, rotund man in a suitsauntered up from behind the lawmaker and reached out to shake hishand.   ``Thanks on behalf of R.J. Reynolds,'' he told a smilingHollings, D-S.C., who had just been on the losing side of two votesaimed at diluting the prohibition. ``It was a good try, but it wasstacked against us.''   These are tough times on Capitol Hill for the R.J. ReynoldsTobacco Co. and the rest of the tobacco industry, one of the mostfree-spending lobbies in Washington.   Cigarette manufacturers find themselves puzzling over how toprevent Congress from broadening the current ban on smoking onairline flights of two hours or less, and they are clearly on thedefensive.   The House voted Aug. 3 to make the restriction permanent, thuspreventing it from expiring next April. The Senate votes this weekon even stronger language permanently prohibiting cigarette smokingon all domestic routes.   ``I don't know what we'll do,'' said Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,whose state leads the nation in tobacco production. ``We'll do whatwe have to do.''   Helms doesn't rule out a filibuster _ protracted debate aimed atpreventing a vote _ and smoking ban supporters say they expect one.   But other tobacco supporters concede that with the threat ofhigher excise taxes on tobacco products and restrictions oncigarette advertising always looming as a possibility, an all-outfight over smoking on airplanes might not be wise.   ``Is this the place we really want to lay down the gauntlet, orshould we fight it out over taxes,'' said Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky.,who represents the country's No. 2 tobacco-growing state.``Strategically, you have to be careful. You don't want to use allyour chips up.''   The tobacco lobby has lots of ammunition to use. According to asurvey by Common Cause, the public interest lobbying group, thecigarette business gave members of Congress $261,000 in speakingfees last year, more than any other industry.   Cigarette companies have also stepped up their efforts in recentyears to politically mobilize smokers.   R.J. Reynolds, for example, maintains lists of smokers itcompiles from coupon rebates and other promotions and encouragesthem to form local smokers' groups. The company pays for a meetingspace and provides refreshments, literature and a videotape at thefirst meeting, encouraging them to fight restrictions such asno-smoking areas and local cigarette taxes.   Reynolds also mails smokers a newsletter six times per yearcalled ``Choice.'' And it maintains a toll-free hotline that itencourages smokers to call when they hear of local anti-cigaretteefforts that may be brewing.   ``We started the program because of the volume of mail we weregetting from smokers telling us they feel like second-classcitizens,'' said Betsy Annese, Reynolds spokeswoman in companyoffices in Winston-Salem, N.C. ``It's all part of a program to helpsmokers regain the rights they feel have been taken away from them.''   Supporters of the airline smoking ban _ health groups and airlineemployee unions _ say that all of this leaves them outgunned.   ``There were two of us standing outside that room yesterday,''ban supporter Jo Ellen Deutsch, a lobbyist for the Association ofFlight Attendants, said of Thursday's Senate AppropriationsCommittee meeting. ``There were at least 30 tobacco people in thathallway.''   Nonetheless, most participants say they expect some tougherversion of the current restrictions to eventually become law.   Advocates of the ban have several factors on their side,including the fact that the author of the expanded restrictions inSen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., chairman of the Appropriationstransportation subcommittee. Few lawmakers care to challenge him andrisk losing transportation projects for their districts.   The issue is also one that many lawmakers have intense personalfeelings about because of their own experiences as smokers andbecause they spend long hours on airliners traveling to and fromtheir districts.   ``You try at every turn because our constituents don't understandunless you fight at every turn,'' said Hollings. ``But we're in theminority position.''</TEXT></DOC>
