The planning necessitates a greaterdepth of thought, but does not involve a significant increase in eithercapital, or operating cost. Current design and operating practice paylittle attention to the problems of eventual removal and abandonment.By recognising the impact of decisions taken during design, installation,and operation on the eventual costs of removal it is possible to modifythe actions taken so that, at no increase in cost, the final cost ofremoval is reduced. To illustrate general lines of argument, specificexamples are given. These are drawn from both the northern and southernsectors of the North Sea.</TEXT></DOC>
