The soft sales, which fell below gains posted in June, will result in depressed earnings for the second fiscal quarter, analysts predicted. &quot;Many retailers are going to report declines or just flat second-quarter results,&quot; said Jeffrey Feiner, a vice president at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Group. He estimates that J.C. Penney Inc. will post second-quarter earnings of 50 cents to 55 cents a share, down from 68 cents a share, and K mart Corp. about 75 cents to 80 cents a share, compared with 71 cents a share last year.    &quot;Consumers have slowed purchases, which is a negative for retailers' earnings but a positive for the economy,&quot; since it may help reduce the trade deficit, noted Margo F. McGlade, a retailing industry analyst at PaineWebber Inc.    Ms. McGlade said her index of 20 companies' sales for stores open at least a year rose only 2.8% in July, a 0.8% decline from June levels. After adjustments for inflation, which is running at about a 4% rate for general merchandise, Ms. McGlade's index shows a sales decline.    However, some analysts think sales and profits are likely to improve at least moderately in the second half as retailers introduce more classic fashions with longer-length hemlines. &quot;It won't be a strong recovery, but we'll see gains over year-ago depressed levels,&quot; said Jeffrey Edelman, a retail analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.    Traditionally, July is a clean-up month for retailers before the launch of fall merchandise, but dull summer fashions that didn't sell at the beginning of the season weren't a lure even at heavy markdown prices, said Mr. Edelman. In addition, soaring temperatures, while spurring sales of air conditioners, left many stores empty.    &quot;With the first blast of heat in June, people rushed to buy barbecues and sporting goods, but by July when it hit 100 degrees, they stayed home,&quot; said Stacy Ruchlamer, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.    She also pointed to the more fundamental problem of high consumer installment debt levels and a slowdown in the rate of personal income growth. &quot;This consumer is stretched with debt,&quot; she said.    The nation's largest retailer, Chicago-based Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co., reported a 5.3% sales gain at U.S. stores open at least a year, while comparable-store sales were flat, despite continued strength in major appliances and home electronics. At Limited Inc., a Columbus, Ohio-based women's apparel specialist, same-store sales also were flat, while Los Angeles-based Carter Hawley Hale said same-store sales increased just 1.6%.    Dallas-based J.C. Penney said comparable-store sales rose 2.1%. The company said sales of catalog merchandise, women's dresses and children's apparel led the July increase, but demand for women's sportswear was &quot;weak,&quot; depressing margins.    Troy, Mich.-based K mart, the second-largest retailer, reported a 0.7% same-store sales increase at stores in the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico. Joseph E. Antonini, chairman and chief executive officer, said sales in early July were weak &quot;due to slower-than-normal traffic,&quot; but improved in the second half of the month, largely in response to sales promotions.    Two notably strong performers were Ames Department Stores Inc. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Analysts said Ames, based in Rocky Hill, Conn., benefited from an improved merchandise mix. Its comparable-store sales jumped 13.6%.    Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart, meanwhile, which posted a 14% increase in same-store sales, continued to gain from its strategy of cutting prices.    With sales on a sluggish track this year, more retailers have been ordering conservatively in an effort to trim inventories. That trend, even more than new fashions, could boost profits this fall, PaineWebber's Ms. McGlade contends.    ---                     Four-week July period                        a-'88 sales   '87 sales      %                           millions    millions   b-change c-Sears .................. 2,110.0     2,004.0     +  5.3 K mart ................... 1,862.5     1,777.6     +  4.8 Wal-Mart ................. 1,593.0     1,221.0     + 30.0 J.C.
