The Foreign Office said Undersecretary Patrick Wright summonedSouth African Ambassador Rae Killen and told him the three mustleave the country within a week.   ``We noted their expression of regret,'' a statement quotedWright as telling Killen. ``However, the South African governmentshould be under no illusions about the grave concern with which HerMajesty's government viewed the involvement by South Africanofficials in this affair.   ``Because of the gravity of this affair, Her Majesty'sgovernment has decided that the South African government should berequested to withdraw three members of the South African Embassy,''the statement said.   The move came two weeks after authorities in Paris arrested aSouth African diplomat, an American arms dealer and three membersof an extreme Protestant organization in Northern Ireland.   The Northern Irelanders allegedly were handing over parts of aBlowpipe, a sophisticated shoulder-fired, anti-aircraft missilemanufactured in Belfast.   The British government expressed grave concern over allegationsthe South Africans were supplying weapons to the Protestants inexchange for the missile parts.   The South African, identified by French sources as Daniel Storm,was released after he claimed diplomatic immunity. A week later,the French government expelled three South African officialsimplicated in the affair.   The Foreign Office spokesman said the three who were ``requestedto withdraw'' are First Secretary for Information Jan H.P.Castelyn, Counselor Jonathan Fourie, and Staff Sgt. Mark Brunner,who works for the defense attache's office. The statement containedno hint that they were involved in the alleged plot.   During the 15-minute meeting, Wright said, ``we had consideredcarefully the South African response,'' particularly a statement byGen. Magnus Malan, South Africa's defense minister, to hiscountry's Parliment on May 3.   At that time, Malan said an official inquiry into the affair hadshown that Storm had acted without government approval. He said heregretted the embarrassment caused to the British, French and Irishgovernments and would act to ensure it would not happen again.   But he also acknowledged on April 24 that South Africa sometimesuses ``unconventional methods'' to get around an international armsembargo against his country.   The Irish government, which has no diplomatic relations withPretoria, delivered a formal protest to South Africa.   According to the Foreign Office statement, Wright noted thatSouth Africa is under a United Nations arms embargo and pointed to``the security situation in Northern Ireland where the lives ofinnocent people are at risk.''   He also warned the South Africans that ``any retaliation wouldbe entirely unjustified.''   The Roman Catholic Irish Republican Army is fighting to push theBritish out of Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland, join it withthe Republic of Ireland and set up an all-Ireland socialist state.Protestant radicals are fighting the IRA effort.   The three Irishmen and one American, Douglas Bernhart, arrestedwith Storm were being held on gun-running and conspiracy charges.   On April 25, federal prosecutors in Bern, Switzerland, opened aninquiry into possible Swiss connections into the affair, sayingBernhart had an office in Geneva.   In Belfast, security sources said one of the three arrested wasa warrants officer in the Territorial Army, a volunteer reserveforce. As a non-commissioned officer, Samuel Quinn, 42, was thoughtto have instructed Territorial Army officers in the use of theBlowpipe.   The other Protestants were not named.</TEXT></DOC>
