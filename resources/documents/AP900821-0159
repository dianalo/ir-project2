He was released in February and has become theeffective leader of the ANC, the country's largest black oppositionmovement.   Mrs. Mandela, who has never previously held a post in the ANC,has been involved in repeated controversies in recent years.   According to court testimony earlier this year, Mrs. Mandela wasaccused of taking part in the beating of four youths at her home inSoweto in December 1988. One of the youths, 14-year-old StompieSeipei, was killed following a series of beatings, according totestimony. Jerry Richardson, one of Mrs. Mandela's bodyguards, wasconvicted of the killing and sentenced to death.   Mrs. Mandela has not been charged.   She also has made recent public statements contradicting herhusband and other ANC leaders. She said the announced suspension ofthe ANC's guerrilla campaign did not necessarily mean ANC violencewould end.   Her husband had announced the end of the armed struggle.</TEXT></DOC>
