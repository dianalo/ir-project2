Rains from Tropical Storm Debby caused mudslides that buried twohomes and killed three people in Papantla, about 16 miles from theGulf of Mexico coast and 150 miles northeast of Mexico City, saidVeracruz state official Alfredo Algarin Vega.   Another person was swept away and presumed drowned when theHueleque River overflowed its banks in Poza Rica, police ChiefRosell Olivares Hernandez said. The government news agency Notimexsaid more than 500 people lost their homes.   Rains caused a flash flood in the town of Alamo, but about30,000 people evacuated safely, according to Enrique Estrada, headof the Red Cross in the nearby gulf city of Tuxpan. About 5,000homes were flooded by the Tuxpan-Pantepec River there, he said. Noinjuries were reported.   Estrada said the river overflowed its banks shortly aftermidnight.   ``In a few minutes, it inundated most of the town,'' he said ina telephone interview. However, he said residents were evacuated toschools and office buildings on high ground before the flood.   Alamo, a coffee-producing town of about 40,000, is 25 milesinland from Tuxpan in the southern state of Veracruz about 300miles south of the Texas border.   Rivers and creeks overflowed their banks and destroyed homes inthe nearby towns of La Antigua, Cazones, Coatzintla and LaPalmilla, Notimex said.   The government oil company Pemex said flood waters from theCotaxtla River ruptured nine oil and natural gas lines in Cotaxtla,about 285 miles east of Mexico City.   Workers were able to shut down the pipelines, which supply theMatapionche petrochemicals plant with 3,600 barrels of crude andgas daily, Pemex said.   Another tropical storm, Kristy, doused the Mexico's PacificOcean coast on Saturday, the Weather Service said. Rivers in thesouthern states of Chiapas and Oaxaca overflowed in the heavy rainsahead of the storm.   Chiapas state Gov. Absalon Castellanos Dominguez declared astate of emergency after 20,000 people evacuated their homesbecause of flooding.   Thousands of people were evacuated from Huixtla, Escuincla,Pijijiapan, Arteaga and Tonala when the Cuatan Grande and the Chicorivers flooded, the Excelsior news service said.   Huixtla is about 10 miles inland from the gulf of Tehuantepec onthe Pacific Coast and about 550 miles southeast of Mexico City.   In Oaxaca, an official for the state government told Excelsiorthat the Salado River flooded about 150 homes along its the banks.   The weather service said Kristy was about 450 miles southwest ofSan Jose del Cabo, a city in the state of Baja California Sur, lateSaturday night and moving west at about 4 mph with winds of between35 and 40 mph.   Weather officials downgraded the system to tropical-depressionstatus.   Debby, the first hurricane of the 1988 Atlantic season before itwas downgraded to tropical storm status, had broken up by Saturdaymorning, weather officials said.   But heavy rains were still falling in parts of Veracruz andTamaulipas states Saturday night, National Weather Servicespokesman Candido Alvarez said by telephone.   Debby hit the coast at Tuxpan, a city of 120,000, on Fridayafternoon as a hurricane. It flooded streets and caused poweroutages in the area about 160 miles northeast of Mexico City. Thecity's port remained closed Saturday.   It weakened several hours after striking land. It continued tolumber inland Saturday.   Debby was the first hurricane of the 1988 Atlantic hurricaneseason and the fourth named storm.</TEXT></DOC>
