Allen Wampler told a House panel onWednesday. ``We monitor that real closely.''   Wampler asked the subcommittee to authorize the expenditure inthe fiscal years 1990, 1991 and 1992. The money pays up to half thecost of projects to show the ways clean-coal technology can be usedby power plants and industry.   Seven projects were given $227 million in the first phase of theprogram, and Wampler said four contracts still being negotiatedwill bring the initial commitment to $400 million.   In addition, he said, the Energy Department will award $575million this year for second-phase projects, using moneyappropriated for fiscal 1988 and 1989. ``The interest is outthere,'' Wampler said.   President Reagan proposed a five-year, $5 billion clean-coalprogram in an effort to curb acid rain, which occurs when sulfurdioxide and other emissions from power plants and factory boilersmix with moisture aloft and fall to the ground as rain.   Acid rain is blamed for aquatic pollution and damage to cropsand forests in the Northeast and Canada.   Although the White House requested $850 million for clean-coalprojects in fiscal 1988 and 1989, Congress approved only the $575million. Wampler said the department is asking Congress to restoremoney cut from the program in addition to authorizing theappropriations for the three years.   While Wampler was seeking more money for the future, a grouprepresenting states and private participants in the program wasmeeting in the nation's capital to learn how members could qualifyfor the $575 million set-aside for second-phase projects.   At its third annual conference, the Clean Coal TechnologyCoalition also endorsed the Energy Department budget request.   ``If the program is successful, the environment will benefit,our national energy security will be strengthened, the use of U.S.coal resources will be assured and consumers' electric or energybills will be kept to a minimum,'' said Ben Yamagata, its executivedirector. ``The benefits are really enormous.''</TEXT></DOC>
