The government had said it planned to bring new charges inOctober superseding a 98-count indictment against Milken, hisbrother, Lowell, and a former Drexel trader.   But now the federal grand jury hearing the Milken case isexpected to hand up an indictment listing additional charges anddefendants either next week or shortly after Jan. 1, 1990, sourcesclose to the case, who asked not to be named, said Monday.   Milken's trial on wide-ranging racketeering and securities fraudcharges is scheduled to start in March, 11 months after theoriginal indictment was issued.   Defense and prosecution attorneys would meet to set a new trialdate once the superseding indictment is returned and the defendantsenter pleas. Defense lawyers speaking privately said the triallikely would not begin before September and possibly could start aslate as January 1991.   Michael and Lowell Milken have pleaded innocent and said theyintend to fight charges of insider trading, tax fraud, takeoverrigging and numerous other violations that allegedly occurred from1984 to 1986.   The original 110-page indictment handed up by a federal grandjury on March 29 after a 2{-year investigation focuses on analleged illegal relationship between Milken and jailed stockspeculator Ivan Boesky.   The new indictment reportedly will include allegations ofillegal stock and bond deals with Drexel clients other than Boesky,including Solomon Asset Management and Columbia Savings and LoanAssociation, of Beverly Hills, Calif.   Boesky, who is eligible for release from prison in April, isexpected to testify at Milken's trial. Additional charges,defendants and a roster of witnesses who have been granted immunityin exchange for testimony are expected to reduce the government'sreliance on Boesky.   Sources on Monday confirmed a report that Gary Winnick, a formertop associate of Milken's at Drexel's high-yield bond division inBeverly Hills, Calif., was given immunity from prosecution andordered to testify in the case.   Winnick previously was subpoenaed to turn over documents butnever was threatened with prosecution. His lawyer, Gary Naftalis,declined to comment. Assistant U.S. Attorney John Carroll did notreturn a call seeking comment.   Also, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday the JusticeDepartment had approved bringing racketeering charges in the Milkencase against three other former Drexel workers and against formerDrexel trader Bruce Newberg, who was named in the first indictment.   A Justice Department spokesman said the department would notcomment.   Milken attorney Martin Flumenbaum said: ``The leaks concerningthe grand jury process are designed to deny Michael Milken a fairtrial. We will not comment on those leaks, whether true or not, andwill no try this case in the press.''   Newberg was sentenced to three months in prison and ordered toforfeit $200,000 on securities fraud and racketeering charges inthe Princeton-Newport partners trial last summer. His attorneys areexpected to argue that he should not be tried twice on similarcharges.   Milken, 43, has set aside about $700 million in assets as partof a bond package and is free pending trial. Milken, widelycredited with reshaping U.S. corporate finance through the use ofhigh-yield, high-risk junk bonds, resigned from Drexel earlier thisyear to form an investment consulting firm.</TEXT></DOC>
