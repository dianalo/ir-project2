Reacting to Tuesday's agreement between House and Senatenegotiators on legislation to change the wage rate for the firsttime in eight years, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwatersaid Bush continues to believe the figure is too high.   ``The president's position is the same, and he reiterated that''during a meeting with Republican senators, the spokesman said.``His first proposal (for a $4.25 top rate) was his last proposal.... He is prepared to veto the bill if they send it up.''   Bush's stance sets up the first showdown on domestic policyinvolving the new president and the Democratic-controlled Congress.   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole several weeks ago told Bush therewere enough Senate supporters of his position to sustain a veto. Anoverride of a presidential veto requires two-thirds of thosepresent and voting in both the House and the Senate.   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas also said Bush wouldhold to his earlier promise to veto the bill.   ``I just want to set the record straight _ the president willnot yield on this,'' Dole said. In reaching consensus on a finalbill so swiftly, Dole said, Democrats pushing the legislation ``ineffect asked for a confrontation with the president.''   It took less than an hour Tuesday for the conferees to completetheir work, thanks in large part to staff negotiations conductedduring last week's congressional recess.   Also contributing to the speedy resolution was that the majorelements of the House and Senate bills were the same. Each calledfor raising the hourly minimum wage from $3.35 to $4.55 by October1991 and for allowing employers to pay some new workers asubminimum training wage for two months.   On the subminimum, the final product contains language veryclose to the Senate version, allowing employers to pay new hires 85percent of the minimum wage if the newcomers have not held a jobfor more than 60 days. Once an individual held a job for 60 days,he or she would never again be eligible to be paid the trainingwage.   The legislation could reach the White House within two weeks,after passage by the separate houses.   Bush has said $4.25 an hour is the highest minimum he willaccept, and even that support hinges on a six-month subminimum thatcould be paid to all new hires regardless of past job experience.   Democrats sponsoring the legislation said they were prepared toconfront Bush with the measure and would attempt to override hisexpected veto, although they concede Bush currently has more thanenough votes to stymie an override effort.</TEXT></DOC>
