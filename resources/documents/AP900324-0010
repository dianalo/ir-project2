Tens of thousands of Lithuanian-Americans live here, and onFriday many made phone calls, wrote letters and sent telegramsurging the Bush administration to take a stronger stand in supportof Lithuania's independence from the Soviet Union.   Lithuanian-Americans in other cities also were collectingdonations to send to their relatives and friends and prepared for aLithuanian independence rally today near the Lincoln Memorial inWashington.   At Nida's Delicatessan and Restaurant in Chicago, the Bushadministration's stand was virtually the only topic of conversation.   ``Everybody's talking about it,'' said owner Liutas Mockunas.``Everybody is listening to the news ... People are disappointed byPresident Bush's policy, they're really upset.''   ``Are we going to have to see massacres like (China's) TiananmenSquare to get the Bush administration to wake up?'' asked DaivaMeile, spokeswoman for the Lithuanian American Council in Chicago.``Everyone is extremely upset that Bush has not come out forcefullyfor Lithuanian independence.''   Early today, the Soviet Union apparently stepped up pressureagainst the breakaway republic as an armored column of almost 100military vehicles rolled through the center of Vilnius, theLithuanian capital. On Friday, the Kremlin ordered foreigndiplomats and some journalists to leave Lithuania as tensionsmounted in the Baltic republic, officials of the Bushadministration said.   In one of his strongest statements on the issue to date, Bush onFriday warned the Soviets against military intervention, saying theUnited States backs the Lithuanian peoples' ``right toself-determination.''   But Lithuanian-Americans said the administration has fallenshort in supporting Lithuania since it declared its independencefrom the Soviet Union on March 11.   ``We are concerned about President Bush's lackadaisicalattitude,'' said Fran Salutas, co-host of Lithuanian-AmericanRadio, a show broadcast from Chicago each Saturday and monitoredclosely by the city's large and tight-knit Lithuanian community.   ``We need moral and political support from the United States.''   Chicago Lithuanians worked Friday to fill buses that would driveovernight to get to the Washington rally, while Lithuanians fromthe Boston area who could not make it to Washington planned asimultaneous demonstration near Bush's summer home inKennebunkport, Maine.   ``We are frustrated,'' said Gintaras Cepas, chairman of theBoston branch of the Lithuanian American Council. ``All we'rereally asking for is moral support _ vocal moral support for whatwas a democratic decision by the people of Lithuania.''   Lithuanians, who flocked to the Boston area in the 19th centuryto work in the burgeoning textile mills of Lawrence and Lowell,have maintained close ties to their heritage, Cepas said.   ``We don't see a silver lining right now ... and that's kind ofscary,'' he said.   In Los Angeles, the Lithuanian community mounted a telephone andletter-writing campaign to fuel U.S. support for the independencemovement.   Activist Antanas Mazeika said many of California's more than50,000 Lithuanian-Americans were calling the White House opinionline and sending letters and telegrams to the president and otherpoliticians.   ``We are trying to push (Bush) to be more responsive,'' Mazeikasaid. ``We feel at this time it is very urgent for Lithuanians. Itis a dangerous time.''</TEXT></DOC>
