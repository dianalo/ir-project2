This notice followsa year-long public discussion of performance-based contracting in JTPAin a broad spectrum of forums, and in response to DOL's March 11, 1988,publication of an issues/options paper, and the August 9, 1988, publicationof a proposed policy interpretation for public comment.The March paper elicited a strong and noteworthy response from the JTPAsystem, in over 210 letters and position papers. These were studied andweighed by the Department prior to the August publication, which in turngenerated 165 comments. The latest comments offered new points in reactionto the proposed policy interpretation and also made reference to viewsexpressed earlier on performance contracting. The August-October commentshave been fully considered by DOL in preparing the final official policyinterpretation.In a September 29, 1988, hearing of the U.S. House of Representatives'Committee on Education and Labor, a series of concerns were expressed bythe General Accounting Office (GAO) that, based on results of a two-yearstudy in progress, the JTPA system does not appear to have targeted services,particularly more intensive training, to those eligibles least ready toindependently obtain jobs; that there is an important link between thequality of the training intervention provided to participants and theirability to be employed in higher skill jobs; and that on-the-job trainingcontracts were identified which subsidized inappropriately long periodsof training for jobs requiring less skilled workers.At the same hearing, the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) of the Departmentof Labor provided its own independent assessment of training and accountabilityissues as a result of three years of its audit work. The OIG expressedconcerns regarding the characteristics of participants, the impact of trainingreceived under JTPA, and the effect the OIG perceives performance-basedcontracting is having on program accountability. A more detailed discussionof the OIG's critique and their resultant conclusion regarding performance-basedcontracting will follow later in this notice.Since a substantial number of Service Delivery Areas (SDAs) rely on performance-basedagreements as their principal method of contracting for services, reviewof the record of JTPA programs to date in meeting the needs of at-riskindividuals and the harder-to-serve portion of the JTPA-eligible populationleads directly to questions concerning the impact of this particular contractmode and the impact of service provider procurement practices on overallprogram performance. During the past year, DOL has discussed this interconnectionbetween performance contracting, whom the program serves, the quality oftraining intervention, and how Congress, the OIG and other auditors willadjudge the effectiveness of the JTPA system in addressing local and nationalneeds for training and employment.DOL believes that to an important extent the colloquy of the past yearhas been successful in developing both an appropriate policy and an understandingof the dynamics of performance contracting, and is proceeding to issuethe official policy interpretation on 20 CFR 629.38(e)(2) with minor adjustmentswhich respond to comments on the August proposed interpretation.Since legislative proposals are now being entertained in the Congress whichdeal with JTPA administrative issues, including procurement, the JTPA systemshould be advised that this policy may serve as a interim step. A subsequentproposal for amendments to adjust JTPA in this and other areas may be madeas well by the Department.<ITAG tagnum="85">Offical Policy Interpretation of the Requirements for Acceptable FixedUnit Price, Performance-Based Contracts Written Under 20 CFR 629.38(e)(2)</ITAG>IntroductionThis notice presents the Department of Labor's final official interpretationof the requirements for contracts written with JTPA service providers pursuantto 20 CFR 629.38(e)(2). It also identifies a number of policy provisionsrecommended for adoption by States which are not found within the specificlanguage of 20 CFR 629.38(e)(2) and, therefore, are not required. Theserecommendations are, however, in the Department's judgment necessary andappropriate for the proper administration of fixed unit price, performance-basedcontracts given the nature of the JTPA system and of statutory design.The official policy interpretation will follow the order of the August9, 1988, publication of the proposed policy (53 FR 29961). The three mainareas are:<ITAG tagnum="15">_The nature of training activities properly chargeable under 20 CFR629.38(e)(2);</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Issues surrounding current practices in the JTPA system for makingpayments to contractors; and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The allowable uses for revenues in excess of costs (or ``profits'')realized through agreements with public and private non-profit agencies.</ITAG>The statement of the official policy interpretation will be preceded bya summary of the comments received by the Department in response to theAugust 9 proposed policy interpretation, and by a listing of the principleswhich the Department followed in debating and formulating the final policy.Background on the Final PolicyThe policy now being issued in final form clarifies and provides greaterdetail regarding Federal expectations of how fixed unit price performance-basedagreements are to be written under this regulation, but leaves the primaryimplementation of the regulation to States and to SDAs in accordance withState and local requirements and procurement codes. The decision to publishthe final policy represents a continued commitment on the part of DOL toa Federal-State-local partnership between business and government to designand direct job training programs, and is consistent with original conceptsfor JTPA management. Since JTPA is now a mature program, with a track recordof both successes and difficulties, DOL points to the general responsibilityshared by all partners to address problems, and implement major adjustmentsand reforms as may be warranted by circumstances at the SDA, State, ornational level.In the final official policy interpretation, a good deal of flexibilityhas been maintained for non-Federal partners to manage JTPA under variedlocal structures, and to innovate in planning and operating programs aslong as Federal concerns regarding the use of performance-based contractsare addressed, and there is effective compliance with procurement requirements,especially with requirements for competitive award whenever possible. SDAsand other JTPA entities which do not presently have sound procurement codesand systems in place are strongly urged to adopt new codes and modify procedures,after consulting with their State JTPA agency regarding the adequacy ofany proposed system, and whether proposed changes are consistent with Statepolicy.DOL's official policy interpretation maintains the features outlined inthe August proposed policy. Both vocationally specific and remedial skillstraining are authorized under the provisions of 20 CFR 629.38(e)(2) aslong as training is designed to lead to placement in an occupational target.Benchmark payments for demonstrated participant attainments prior to participantplacement can be the basis of earned payments for contractors, which shouldfacilitate greater investment in longer-term and more enriched programsfor the harder-to-serve portion of the eligible population. Despite somesustained disagreement at the SDA and service provider levels with DOL'sproposed policy to limit use of profits earned through performance-basedagreements to additional JTPA activities, DOL's final policy defines properlyearned revenues in excess of costs accrued by public and private non-profitagencies through JTPA contracts to be program income, which is to be usedin accordance with JTPA regulations at 20 CFR 629.32. This will offer agencieswho are successful in meeting or surpassing contract goals the incentiveof gain through additional earned payments and flexibility in expandingJTPA services, but will preclude a loss in accountability for JTPA resourcesand possible abuse through the channeling of unrestricted-use profits intoactivities and enterprises not related to JTPA's statutory purpose.Other references on performance-based contracting under JTPA include:1. The March 15, 1983, implementation regulations for JTPA [48 FR 11081],which contained the provisions of 20 CFR 629.38(e)(2) governing the useof fixed unit price, performance contracts.This section of JTPA regulations established conditions for contracts writtenfor training that were fixed unit price and specified the following performancecriteria for full payment:Participants are to complete training;<ITAG tagnum="15">_Be placed;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_In the occupation trained for;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_At not less than the wage specified in the agreement.</ITAG>The source of this regulation was an administrative action on the partof DOL to transfer into JTPA an identical provision from the ComprehensiveEmployment and Training Act (CETA) regulations. The CETA regulation hadbeen adopted after the enactment of the CETA Amendments of 1978, to giveflexibility to certain private sector trainers to bid on a fixed pricebasis for performance-based training contracts without being required tobreak out the administrative cost component of their fixed price total.2. The June 15, 1985 revision to JTPA Regulations (50 FR 24764), to incorporatea provision of section 131(d)(3) of JTPA on training packages for youth.This revision resulted from section 7 of Carl Perkins Vocational EducationAct of 1984, Pub. L. 95-524.3. Training and Employment Guidance Letter (TEGL) 3-87 of November 18,1987, entitled ``Mounting Concerns Regarding `Problem Contracts' Writtenunder 20 CFR 629.38(e)(2).''The TEGL resulted from a 6-month review to examine current practices inthe JTPA system regarding administration of fixed unit price, performance-basedcontracts, and procurement systems in general. In some localities, a vacuumexisted which made poor procurements, loosely written agreements not conformingfully to 20 CFR 629.38(e)(2), and questionable administrative arrangementspossible. In the TEGL, DOL described a series of problems that had beenidentified with fixed unit price performance-based agreements, enumeratedtypes of ``problem contracts,'' and asked for the cooperation of States,SDAs and PICs to examine local contracting practices, focusing on compliancewith procurement codes.4. ``Policy Considerations in Administering JTPA Regulations on Fixed UnitPrice, Performance-Based Contracts,'' a February 1988 issues/options paperwhich was published as a Notice for 30-day comment in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on March 11, 1988 (53 FR 7989). This paper presented for public review and comment an analysis of the mainissues and the Department's options for policy guidance and regulatoryinterpretation, or new rulemaking. The paper was released to public interestgroups and was the basis for a briefing for Congressional staff from Houseand Senate Committees. Comments on the August Publication of the Proposed Policy Letters and detailed statements of comment were received from a total of165 respondents, as follows:<ITAG tagnum="15">31 States</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">59 Service Delivery Areas</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">13 Private Industry Councils</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">46 Service providers</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">7 National organizations/public interest groups</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">3 Members of Congress</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">2 Private citizens</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">4 Other</ITAG>In general, comments were submitted by many of the same parties that hadcommented extensively on the March 11 Issues/Options paper publication,and commenters whose views on particular points had not changed referredto their earlier statements. Many commenters, especially a number of States,took an overall positive approach to the proposed policy, and their areasof agreement or acceptance of proposed policy were reflected in shortercomment statements. Most commenters noted DOL's evident commitment to consultaitonwith its partners in the JTPA system, and DOL's incorporation of commenters'input in developing the proposed policy. There were, however, a substantialnumber of commenters remaining in disagreement with DOL's proposed policy,or specific portions of the proposed policy. Particularly at the SDA andservice provider levels, objections were raised to any DOL policy whichwould limit local options in contracting under 20 CFR 629.38(e)(2) or inthe use of excess revenues/``profits'' generated by public and privatenon-profit agencies through fixed unit price, performance-based agreements.Since the DOL official policy interpretation is of the existing JTPA regulationsat 20 CFR 629.38(e)(2) and not a rewriting of JTPA regulations, a numberof commenters raised potential difficulties that could develop during theconduct of audits of JTPA activities by SDAs, States, and by other auditors,should auditors apply the interpretation rather than the JTPA regulationitself in determining whether specific costs incurred under fixed unitprice, performance-based contracts were allowable costs. In the ``Basic Principles'' section of the Final Official Policy Interpretation,DOL has clarified that the regulation at 20 CFR 629.38(e)(2) and otherapplicable regulations are the proper basis for audit findings. The JTPAregulations do, however, grant binding status to the guidelines adoptedby the Governor ``to the extent such as consistent with Act and applicablerules and regulations'' (20 CFR 627.1), and establish the authority ofState rules and regulations in determining the allowability of costs (20CFR 629.37(a)). Therefore, recipients and subrecipients operating fixedunit price, performance-based agreements must comply with Federal law andregulations, and State laws, regulations and guidelines for the purposeof audit. Importantly, this includes all State and local procurement codesand requirements in effect at the time of a JTPA procurement. While the official policy interpretation is not intended to serve as aseparate standard for the purpose of conducting financial audits, it isthe official interpretation of the Department's regulations and could bebrought to bear in an audit. DOL will apply this interpretation nationwidethrough oversight of State JTPA systems and programs. States are to usethis interpretation and related State policy issuances when monitoringSDAs and their subrecipients, and in other State oversight activities.Prior to the September 29 Congressional hearing, the Department's OIG commentedformally on the August 9 proposed policy, recommending that the JTPA regulationat 20 CFR 629.38(e)(2) be eliminated. The OIG noted its position was basedon ``the result of a significant amount of audit work in the area of JTPAfixed unit price contracting,'' and its concerns that the intent of Congressregarding Section 108 of JTPA, ``Limitations on certain costs,'' be met.The Employment and Training Administration respects the OIG's perspectiveand its concerns for accountability, but has recognized since the summerof 1987 that any regulatory move to eliminate fixed unit price agreementswritten under 20 CFR 629.38(e)(2) so as to be chargeable 100 percent tothe training cost category would be profoundly disruptive to the JTPA system,both philosophically and practically. As indicated in earlier publications,the Department is fully aware of the strong preference on the part of manyPICs for a rewards-sanctions, payment for documented performance approachin the procurement of service providers. This philosophy evolved earlyin the implementation of JTPA, as an extension of the performance standards-drivendesign of the Act, and pursuant to rules and guidelines for allowabilityof costs and for procurement issued by States under the Governor's authority.As a practical matter, it would not appear possible to eliminate the provisionsof paragraph (e)(2) of andSection; 629.38, without full consideration ofthe likely impact on SDAs at this time, nearly 5 years after JTPA was implemented.Small and mid-sized jurisdictions, which chose to become service deliveryareas and are now fully institutionalized and have private-sector volunteerscommitted to locally directed programs, would experience a serious crisisif the flexibility of 20 CFR 629.38(e)(2) were eliminated, and local publicor private resources were not available to subsidize overhead. Any decisionto return to mandatory allocation of all contract costs, including thosewritten as fixed unit price, performance-based agreements, would, in theDepartment's view, occur most appropriately at the time of future leigislativeamendment, when this decision could be made in conjunction with overallconsiderations of the delivery system structure, the nature of costs, anddesired program results. The OIG further recommended in its comments that, should 20 CFR 629.38(e)(2)be retained, the regulation be amended to incorporate DOL's new clarifyinglanguage and standards of accountability directly into the regulation.The Employment and Training Administration (ETA) has openly discussed thispossibility with the JTPA community during the dialogue of the past year,and has concluded that Federal efforts to obtain the cooperation of Stateand local partners to review and as necessary improve contracting practiceshave been largely successful. The response of the JTPA system, while frequentlyexpressing misgivings about a perceived change in the Federal role, hasimpressed the Department with the commitment of the commenters to theirprograms, and the quality of study that has been directed towards the questionsof performance contracting and procurement in general. It would appearthat on a decentralized basis, States and SDAs have improved practices,initiated new policies, and have begun monitoring compliance with local,legally required procurement systems in a way that substantially addressesthe OIG's valid interest in more complete accountability. The Departmentplans, resultantly, to take the OIG's recommendation for regulatory amendmentunder advisement, and await developments during the next program year todetermine whether States, SDAs, and service providers have complied withthe official interpretation of 20 CFR 629.38(e)(2), or whether a revisionof the regulation specifying Federal-level definitions and controls isnecessary. <ITAG tagnum="84">Training Activities Chargeable Under 20 CFR 629.38(e)(2)</ITAG>Taken together, commenters expressed strong support for the concept ofcore training in performance-based contracting, which may be either occupationaltraining or basic skills/remediation training geared to make participantsemployment competent. In the final policy, DOL has clarified that the ``retrainingservices'' enumerated under Section 314(d)(1) of the Economic Dislocationand Worker Adjustment Assistance Act (EDWAA) (Title VI Subtitle D. Pub.L. 100-418, 102 Stat. 1107) will satisfy this <T3>core </T3>training requirement, with the exclusion of out-of-area jobsearch and relocation (Section 314 (d)(1), items (D) and (E)). The finalpolicy also emphasizes that core training must be the primary purpose ofcontracts written under the 20 CFR 629.38(e)(2) regulation. A number of commenters, especially at the SDA and service provider levels,argued that it is impractical and prohibitively burdensome for the Department'sinterpretation to require that each contract separately price each trainingcurriculum to be provided under a contract charged per 20 CFR 629.38(e)(2).Contracts may be written for program-year long training services from acommunity college, for example, without knowing in advance the specifictraining needs and, thus, curricula that individual JTPA participants willrequire to successfully compete for local employment. The Department hasdecided to accept the rationale offered by several commenters that a tightlydrawn proposal for training can be constructed, based on planned typesof training to be offered, the duration of each type, and instructional,material and facility costs involved. Such a proposal can specify a proposedfixed unit price for each type of training curriculum, which then can beassessed for price reasonableness during the analysis of proposed costsrequired by the State/local procurement system, prior to award. The finalofficial policy interpretation has been adjusted accordingly. The Department reviewed comments on the proposed policy's requirement forspecification of the elements of training packages charged under 20 CFR629.38(e)(2). The Department believes that the training package conceptas outlined contains sufficient flexibility for service providers to tailoran individual participant's program, while requiring the level of detailneeded for proposers to construct a price and the JTPA procurement officersto determine price reasonableness. The August 9 proposed policy under ``Specifications for acceptable contracts''did not, in the view of many commenters, adequately allow for the realitiesof on-the-job training (OJT) agreements. As was the case earlier in thedevelopment of DOL's performance-based contracting policy, the argumentsput forth suggested that DOL rethink its position. DOL has in the pastassumed that OJT agreements would most naturally continue to be in theform of cost reimbursable contracts written directly with private employertrainers, or in the form of cost reimbursable general contracts writtenwith one agency, community organization, or for-profit entity which inturn develops and writes specific OJT contracts with interested employers.Having shifted to the performance contracting mode as the preferred method,many SDAs and PICs contract the OJT portion of their overall JTPA systemusing fixed unit price, performance-based contracts. DOL's proposed policyrequiring contract specificity in OJT would apply equally to any generalOJT contract written by an SDA, and commenters pointed out that the policyas proposed would effectively preclude a performance-based general contractenabling small-sized contracts, geographically dispersed with rural employers,and contracts for immediate training positions developed with employerson a short turn around basis.The Department has strongly encouraged maximal use of OJT in JTPA programs,research under JTPA and previous program legislation having demonstratedthat this method of training on the average to be the most effective pathwayto placement, retention and long-term wage gain for eligible trainees.Further, DOL understands that a general contractor is frequently used tomarket OJT, develop contracts, and often provide centralized participantrecruitment, counseling services, alternative placement, if needed, andretention followup. Consistent with DOL's present emphasis, a general contractormight be responsible to provide ancillary basic skill remediation whichthe harder-to-serve portion of the local JTPA-eligible population may requirein order to successfully participate in OJT. Given these considerations,the section ``Specifications for acceptable contracts'' has been revisedto include a new discussion on OJT contracts, which lays out guidelinesfor acceptable general contractor arrangements for OJT written on a fixedunit price basis under 20 CFR 629.38(e)(2).Most commenters endorsed DOL's recommendation that States establish policiesfor performance-based agreements to be structured to serve more of theharder-to-serve in the local eligible population, through expanded skillremediation capabilities and adjustments to the unit price to reflect costsand performance risks undertaken in successfully training and placing suchpersons. Several commenters stated that focus on the harder-to-serve mightdeflect JTPA away from higher skill job opportunities and the technicaltraining needed to prepare for these jobs. The challenge to prepare theJTPA population for emerging jobs is generally recognized in the employmentand training community to be an unavoidable dynamic of the changing labormarket, and ``creaming'' strategies or low-investment training interventions,while possible in the short run, will in the longer run fail both localemployers and local JTPA-eligible jobseekers. PICs and SDA managers canuse their procurement process, whether through cost reimbursement or fixedprice, performance-based contracts, to refocus their JTPA system on longerterm interventions. An SDA's proposal solicitation can specify not onlyincreased investment of JTPA funds in training, but also put a premiumon outside training, services, and support that a proposer may be ableto leverage with JTPA dollars, for a total approach that better enablesparticipants to remain in and benefit from longer skill training.The August 9 proposed policy's provision regarding umbrella contracts (andcontracts termed ``blanket'' and ``comprehensive service'') caused a numberof SDAs and several States with large rural districts to disagree. TheDepartment believes that it is possible to write broad-based training contractscarefully so that the contracts conform to all of the requirements foracceptable fixed price contracts chargeable to training under 20 CFR 629.38(e)(2),with additional effort in proposal development and in procurement review.If it does not appear possible to conform with these guidelines withina given locality, it is not acceptable to the Department that such agreementsbe entered into, reflecting a lack of the full specificity regarding deliverableswhich is required for any contract to be priced during procurement. TheDepartment will not make it easy to contract for undefined services bycondoning the use of the administrative cost flexibility under 20 CFR 629.38(e)(2),so that such a contract is chargeable 100 percent to the training costcategory. No change has been made, therefore, in this provision for thefinal policy interpretation. <ITAG tagnum="84">Payments to Contractors</ITAG>The body of comments on this section of the proposed policy were reviewedto determine what adjustments, in balance, should be made to arrive ata responsible final policy. The Department has made several adjustments.On the question of the amount of the total contract that should be heldback to ``ride'' on the full performance, placement record of the contractor,a national organization and a number of service providers expressed concernthat SDAs and other contracting agencies may establish excessively highholdbacks that could drive service providers without other cash reservesout of the JTPA business. DOL understands the argument that excessivelyclose-fisted policies also can actually drive up unit prices for the samedeliverables, as a result of greater payment delay and carrying costs forthose contractors willing to bid. Language has been added to the provisionon payments withheld to suggest that States and SDAs consider these possibledisincentives to community based service providers when establishing orrevising their holdback policies.One commenter raised an important question regarding the need of recipientsand subrecipients to maintain records allowing for the proper allocationof costs charged to JTPA should a fixed unit price, performance-based contractbe found not to have met the provisions specified at 20 CFR 629.38(e)(2),or should the contract have failed to meet a preestablished performancethreshold and not qualify under State/SDA rules to be charged 100 percentto the training cost category.In considering this comment, DOL has reviewed requirements that have appliedto all of JTPA since the inception of programs under the Act. The March15, 1983 regulations (48 FR 11080-11083] contain a number of importantreferences to the types of records necesary for a subrecipient to collectand maintain in order to demonstrate compliance with the Act and thoserules, interpretations and definitions adopted by the State in accordancewith the Governor's authority (20 CFR 627.1). At 20 CFR 629.35, in paragraph(a), the Governor is directed to ensure that financial systems within theState provide fiscal control and accounting procedures sufficient to permitthe tracing of expenditures to establish that funds have not been usedin violation of any restrictions on their use. Paragraphs (e) through (f)of this subsection indicate the State's responsibility to see that allfinancial, participant and others records and supporting documentationare maintained for a period of three years.The JTPA regulation at 20 CFR 629.38(a) and (b) provides that allowablecosts shall be charged against the training, administration, and participantsupport cost categories, and properly allocated. Paragraphs (c) and (d)outline the Governor's responsibility to ensure that programs administeredat the State level and the SDA level ``plan, control, and charge expendituresagainst the afforementioned cost categories.'' This same language is repeatedat 20 CFR 631.13(a)(1) and (2), in ``Additional Title III AdministrativeStandards and Procedures.'' Therefore, States have an ongoing responsibilityto issue specific cost accounting and recordkeeping requirements to SDAsand statewide programs within the State, so that all JTPA programs, includingthose contracted for on a fixed unit price, performance basis, can demonstrateexpenditures have been controlled against applicable cost limits.A related recordkeeping requirement regards the treatment of program incomeunder State rules. Since as discussed elsewhere in this policy interpretation,revenue in excess of cost accrued by public and private non-profit agenciesthrough performance-based agreements has been determined by DOL to be programincome, State accounting and recordkeeping requirements established under20 CFR 629.32, ``program income'' are to include a method for determiningwhat amount of program income has been accrued by contractors, and a methodfor maintaining records on the expenditure of such income.A number of commenters indicated difficulty accommodating themselves tothe failed contract concept which was strongly recommended under ``Thresholdfor Contract Performance in Order to Qualify for Provisions at 20 CFR 629.38(e)(2).''Among these commenters were several who make a strong case that ``failedcontracts'' is in fact a front-end, procurement award problem, and notedthat improved proposal review should eliminate service providers incapableof placement results. Other stated that contractors who achieve unacceptablylow placement records will, under local SDA policies, earn very littlepayment. The Department introduced the concept in the August 9 publicationprecisely because it has been seen possible under some payment policiesfor a contractor to fail to place most participants per a performance contract'sgoals, but still be substantially reimbursed for costs.In this circumstance, the Department does not believe the contract to betruly ``performance based'' and, therefore, concludes that the cost ofsuch a failed contract should be allocated among the regular JTPA costcategories of administration, services, and training. In the proposed policy,the Department did not peg a performance threshold at which ``failure''occurs, considering this question one best taken up by States and SDAsin the context of improvements to their procurement systems. Some SDAswith smaller allocations have indicated that the size of their normal 15percent administrative budget does not allow much leeway should a contractwritten under 20 CFR 639.38(e)(2) be later deemed to fail, and find unacceptablethe fiscal uncertainly that they might inadvertently exceed their administrativeallowance and owe the Federal Government for an overexpenditure. Afterweighing these comments, the Department has adjusted the wording for thisprovision from ``strongly recommends'' to ``recommends'', with the suggestionthat jurisdictions not able to incorporate this provision recognize theparticular emphasis they must place on proposal review and on sound practicesfor payments earned prior to full performance.The Department does not believe it prudent to endorse non-contingent benchmarkpayments for intake, enrollment, and assessment activities performed bycontractors. Local policies can provide for up-front advances to contractorsneeding funds to cover this portion of their program, and advances canbe offset by contractor earnings once measurable benchmarks involving participantattainments in actual training are achieved. On the other hand, the Departmenthaving accepted the extensive arguments offered by States, SDAs, and nationalorganizations that benchmark payments for measurable pre-placement attainmentscould be legitimately earned if payment was made for documented benchmarks,there would appear to be no benefit to now encourage or require Statesto adopt policies advocated by one commenter which would treat all paymentsprior to full performance as a form of advance, not earned but contingenton placement.In response to a number of commenters, the Department still believes thatthe matter of trainees who drop out prior to completing their trainingbut who self-place in the general occupational field is relevant in determiningwhat a contractor might earn for providing a segment of training beforethe participant quit the program and, therefore, should logically be reflectedin a reduced full payment.<ITAG tagnum="85">Revenues in Excess of Costs Accrued by Public and Private Non-ProfitAgencies</ITAG>The Department believes that the position taken in the August 9 proposedpolicy interpretation is the right position, and is not dissuaded fromits position by comments received from a number of respected sources inthe JTPA community. Properly earned revenues in excess of costs realizedby public and private non-profit agencies through the provision of JTPAservices under performance-based contracts should properly be classifiedas program income, and administered consistent with the purposes of JTPAand in accordance with State policy. The principle of gain is maintained;an agency earning program income has the flexibility to expand its JTPAactivities, initiating additional training or experimenting with new trainingapproaches. The concept of free-use profit, which could be diverted fromJTPA purposes to other functions and purposes of an agency, is not acceptableto DOL nor to Congressional commenters, regardless of the worth of manyof the intended non-JTPA related uses that have been described. The Departmentagrees with a number of commenters that the question of excessive profitsis a separate and important question, applying equally to contracts withprivate for-profit service providers as well as private non-profit andpublic agencies excessive profits are controlled through strong procurementsystems, which emphasize competition whenever possible; which require proposalsto specify all training, services and other deliverables to be provided;which require contracts to be carefully written to preclude low-optionservices billed as full price interventions; and which carefully evaluatethe reasonableness of proposed costs before contracts are awarded. To preservethe soundness of the JTPA system, it is necessasry both to ensure thatcontractor profits are reasonable, given the risks and costs involved,and that public and private non-profit sector organizations do not divertJTPA's limited resources for other purposes.<ITAG tagnum="85">Official Interpretation of the Requirements of 20 CFR 629.38(e)(2)</ITAG>Basic Principles of the Department in Establishing an Official Policy Interpretation:<ITAG tagnum="15">_The Department of Labor's overall objective is to provide operationalguidance within the framework of the current 20 CFR 629.38(e)(2) regulation,but proper administration of performance-based contracts calls for theestablishment of some new policies, which DOL will recommend for Stateadoption.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Since the purpose of the policy interpretation is to provide operationalguidance on the application of fixed unit price contracting under the existingJTPA regulation at 20 CFR 629.38(e)(2), it should be clarified that DOLdid not prepare the policy interpretation to serve as a standard for conductingfinancial audits, but as the official interpretation of the Department'sregulations, this policy could be brought to bear in an audit.

Training Activities Chargeable</ITAG>A. Definition of allowable adult and youth training activities for thepurposes of 20 CFR 629.38(e)(2):andbullet; Training must consist of a core of either occupational trainingor basic skills/remediation training, or both. For programs authorizedunder the EDWAA amendments to JTPA, core training will consist of the activitiesauthorized under JTPA section 314(d)(1), ``retraining services'', withthe exclusion of out-of-area job search and relocation (section 314(d)(1),items (D)(E)). The provision of core training activities must be the primarypurpose of contracts written under this regulation governing fixed unitprice, performance-based agreements charged 100 percent to the JTPA costcategory.andbullet; All training must be geared to make participants employment compententand must be tied to a specific or a general occupational target. This trainingneed not involve a specific job title, but can encompass a range of jobswith similar entry requirements.andbullet; Placement must be at or above the specific wage in the agreement,and reflect an appropriate entry wage rate for the specific or generaloccupational target, given the relative skill level of trainees. Again,this can mean a range of jobs. For example, the skills needed for a dataentry technician allow entry into jobs with different occupational titlesand types of companies. B. Clarification of the allowability of training packages for the purposesof 20 CFR 629.38(e)(2):Acceptable elements may include but are not limited to outreach, intake,skill assessment and employability development planning, participant services,basic skills development, counseling, pre-employment/work maturity training,job search assistance, and followup services, provided that a core of basicskills and/or specific occupational training per I.A. above is the primarypurpose of the contract. Also, the program must be designed for all participantsto receive the core training.C. Specifications for acceptable fixed unit price, performance-based contracts:andbullet; In general, these contracts are to be written in accordance withsound procurement practices and applicable codes. This includes methodsfor assuring arm's length negotiation of contracts, proposal review whichverifies and documents the reasonableness of proposed costs, and, wheneverpossible, competition for award.andbullet; Each contract must clearly list and separately price each typeof training curriculum to be provided. Curricula are to be priced by type,duration, and other factors governing instructional costs, material costs,or facility costs, and each contract must specify the fixed unit priceof each type of planned training.All elements constituting the training package must be clearly spelledout in the contract. This includes the course schedule for each element,the hours and/or the numbers of weeks of training, the expected numberof participants who would require the element, the policy regarding non-completersand the measurable outcome.andbullet; Pursuant to State/SDA policies, the contract must clearly indicatethe organization which is providing the training, participant servicesand administration being charged to the contract. Care is to be given toassuring that only those administrative costs attributable to the trainingare chargeable under the contract. However, DOL is not promulgating a Federalrequirement stipulating that performance-based contract document separatelylist administrative costs, or requiring a separate reporting of actualadministrative costs.andbullet; Job Search Assistance (JSA) designs. Services and participantsequences that do <T3>not </T3>involve core training per I.A. above such as JSA-only interventions,are not chargeable under the 20 CFR 629.38(e)(2) regulation.andbullet; On-the-Job Training (OJT). When written as fixed unit price, performance-basedcontracts rather than as cost-reimbursable agreements, it is recommendedthat contracts for OJT be written directly with the employer or other serviceprovider whenever possible, particularly in the case of large contractsand those developed in advance. However, in order to facilitate the writingof small OJT agreements, especially contracts for one or small groups oftrainees and to facilitate offering OJT through interested employers acrosslarge, less populated SDAs, it is also acceptable for OJT agreements tobe developed during the program year pursuant to one general contract witha public agency, community based organization, or other JTPA service provider,provided that the general contract specifies the types and duration ofOJT to be developed and other services to be performed so that proposedcosts can be fairly analyzed, and that the awarding of the general contractis in accordance with State/local procurement requirements. Additionally,a general contract for OJT must identify whatever outreach, recruitment,participant training, counseling, placement, followup or other servicesthe general contractor agrees to provide within its own organization, whatwill be provided by the employers actually conducting the OJT, and whatplanned services may be provided with or without cost by the other agenciesand subcontractors. The general contractor must be required to ensure thereasonableness of all elements of subcontractor cost, and document itssubcontract negotiations.In addition to clear delineation of deliverables, providers, and costs,a general contract for OJT must be priced using some rational method, forexample, based on local historical costs for OJT, and factoring in thecost of any enhancements through outside skill remediation or any new servicesplanned to improve upon local OJT quality and placement retention.andbullet; Further, it is strongly recommended that States establish policiesfor performance-based contracts to be designed to accommodate and encourageservice to more at-risk populations. This might involve an additional adjustmentto the unit price to provide increased financial incentive for trainingand placing a more at-risk population. D. Allowability of Umbrella Contracts:All contracts, including umbrella, blanket, or comprehensive service contractsmust meet the requirements of elements I.A., B., and C. above in orderto qualify for the cost charging provisions under 20 CFR 629.38(e)(2).The costs of fixed unit price, performance-based agreements which do notsatisfy these requirements must be allocated among the normal JTPA costcategories of training, participant support, and administration.E. Clarification Regarding Training Packages for Youth:Contracts may be written under 20 CFR 629.38(e)(2) for training packagesfor youth, which stipulate full performance as attainment of one or morePIC-recognized competency skill areas per the list of positive outcomesfound in Section 106(b)(2) of JTPA, or if the training results in employment.<ITAG tagnum="81">II. Payments to Contractors Under 20 CFR 639.38(e)(2)</ITAG>A. Full Payment. Full payment of the full unit price must be contingentupon:andbullet; Completion of training;andbullet; Placement in the occupation trained for or within a general occupationaltarget;andbullet; At not less than the wage rate specified in the agreement.Also, the Department recommends (but does not require) that States/SDAsset a policy indicating this wage rate should reflect the entry level wagefor the occupational target.andbullet; The agreement must provide for a method to reduce payment in caseswhere individuals do not complete the training but do place successfullyin an occupation specified, or complete the training and are placed belowthe specified wage level. For example, a participant is word processingdrops out in the fifth week of a 10-week training program, but obtainsa training related job within the general occupational target at or abovethe specified wage.Further, the Department recommends (but does not require) that State/SDApolicies provide that participants who leave before entering core trainingper I.A. above either<ITAG tagnum="15">_Cannot be the basis of any payment earned by the contractor; or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Are only the basis for earned payments that are apportioned or proratedamong the regular JTPA cost categories, and not charged 100 percent totraining.</ITAG>B. Partial earned payments for attainment of performance benchmarks. TheDepartment has determined that in specific circumstances performance shortof full peformance/placement can be the basis of earned payments for partialperformance when:andbullet; The performance is measureable and documented and include trainingper I.A. above;andbullet; The payment schedule amount for any intermediate benchmark isnot more than the estimated costs of providing that increment of the plannedtraining. However, the subtotal of possible payment schedule amounts forall performance benchmarks prior to full performance/placement must beclearly less than the point at which the contractor's costs are covered,in order to ensure the principle of contractor risk and to stimulate contractorperformance to earn full payment.andbullet; Costs associated with intake, enrollment and assessment activitiesalone without participation in core training can not be the basis of earnedbenchmark payments chargeable 100 percent to the training cost categoryper 20 CFR 629.38(e)(2).C. Advance Payments. All payments made to contractors prior to full performance/placementthat do not conform to the above requirements for benchmarks must be consideredadvances contingent on the full performance/placement record of the contract.D. Guidance on Payments to be Withheld Prior to Full Performance. Whetherpayments made to contractors prior to full performance/placement are advancepayments or partial earned payments for the attainment of performance benchmarks,in principle a significant portion of the total fixed price should be heldback until earned through placement. States and SDAs have latitude to adjustthe amount held back to accommodate longer-term and more intensive programsserving at-risk populations, recognizing the operational needs of contractorsfor funds. As a matter of general guidance, an amount equal to 25 to 30precent of the total contract cost would appear to be a prudent and significantholdback level, well below reimbursement of total contractor expenses,and insuring that contracts are consistent with the performance-based contractingconcept of risk prior to full performance.Conversely, States and SDAs should recognize the disincentive effect thatparsimonious payment policies and holdbacks might have on their potentialJTPA service providers. A balance needs to be struck between natural PIC/SDAinterests in ensuring contractor performance, and good judgment in administeringpolicies that are amenable to responsible potential deliverers, includingcommunity based organizations.E. Threshold for Contract Performance in Order to Qualify for Provisionsat 20 CFR 629.38(e)(2).In the Department's consideration of payment issues, it was determinedthat there is a level of contract placement performance below which thecontract should be viewed as failed. Failed contracts should not be affordedunder State/SDA policies the advantage of assigning all costs to trainingaccording to the provisions of 20 CFR 629.38(e)(2). Therefore, the Departmentrecommends (but does not require) that States and SDAs define a thresholdlevel of placement performance below which a performance-based contractwritten under 20 CFR 629.38(e)(2) would be determined to have failed. Statesand SDAs should establish procedures for properly charging of all costsof such failed contracts among the regular three JTPA cost categories.This threshold level should be appropriately specified, taking into accountgreater or lesser contractor risk in terms of length, complexity of training,and the population to be served by a contract. F. Direct Contracts Versus Tiered Administrative Structures. Contractswhich qualify for the cost allocation provisions of 20 CFR 629.38(e)(2)are contracts for the direct provision of training by an agency, institution,or business, and must not, with the exception of OJT as dicussed in sectionI. of this policy interpretation, involve intermediary administrative entities.Such an entity, if needed, are to be charged to the administrative costcategory. This element of DOL's interpretation does not preclude subcontractingon a fee payment or on a cost reimbursement basis by the training contractorof some specialized client services if this is determined to be more effectiveand efficient, and is authorized by State/SDA policies and the contractdocument. <ITAG tagnum="81">III. Revenues in Excess of Costs, or ``Profits'' </ITAG>Public or private non-profit contractor revenues in excess of costs (whichhave been properly earned) are to be treated as program income pursuantto 20 CFR 629.32. Accordingly, these funds may be retained by the serviceprovider (or by the SDA or the Governor) to underwrite additional trainingor training related services pursuant to the project or program which generatedthem, consistent with the purposes of JTPA. As with other JTPA programincome, contractors are to comply with State accounting and recordkeepingrequirements, so that the amount of program income accured by the contractorcan be determined, and the contractor maintains records which account forthe use of these funds, in anticipation of possible audit. <ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion </ITAG>The above final official policy interpretation on contracting under the20 CFR 629.38(e)(2) regulation follows a long consultative process duringwhich the Department, and later other Federal agencies, have presentedconcerns regarding the acceptability of some of the applications extantin the JTPA system, and have raised larger and related questions aboutprocurement practrices in general, and what training the JTPA system producesfor eligible persons needing training and jobs. States, SDAs and privatesector volunteers who partner with the Federal Government and make JTPAhappen have shared a considerable amount of information with the Departmentdescribing the realities of training contracts, and how they believe theflexibility 20 CFR 629.38(e)(2) can be legitimately used. Commenters havetouched on nearly all aspects of program operations in their correspondence,given the extent of performance contracting today. The Department appreciatesthe great amount of thinking that went into the response from the system,and particularly the effort to have performance-based contracting understoodin context. DOL believes that States and SDAs have exhibited a willingnessto respond not only with discussion, but with changes and improvementsthat are now completed or in progress. The dialogue has been very educationalfor DOL, and as the Department developed a better understanding, it hasbeen possible to update the agency's thinking on performance contractingand adopt modified policies without losing sight of Federal concerns forsound and defensible practices. The process of developing the final policyinterpretation has been brought to this point without a modification tothe present JTPA regulation at 20 CFR 629.38(e)(2), or a change in thebasic partnership arrangement for the administration of JTPA which the1983 regulations established.<ITAG tagnum="21">Signed at Washington, DC, this 8th day of March 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Roberts T.
