Walton, FBI chief in Detroit from 1985 to1988, said in Sunday's Detroit News.   ``There was more than one person who killed Jimmy Hoffa or wasinvolved in the efforts. (But) we can't force a source, for example,to testify,'' said the 24-year agent.   Walton declined to be specific but said some informants andsuspects are dead.   Hoffa's son said the FBI could ease the family's pain bydispelling some of the mystery surrounding the 1975 disappearance ofthe former Teamsters boss.   ``I think it is incumbent upon the FBI, if in fact they do knowwho was involved in the slaying of my father, that they share thatinformation with the family,'' James Hoffa said in today's DetroitFree Press.</TEXT></DOC>
