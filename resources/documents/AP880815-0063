GRAY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Amnesty International says witnessestell it Burmese troops have killed and tortured rice farmers andother Shan tribespeople in suppressing an insurgency among Burma'slargest ethnic minority.   The report by the London-based group, received in Bangkok today,was the second documentation that Amnesty says shows ``a consistentpattern of gross violations of human rights'' by the Burmesemilitary in trying to suppress minorities fighting for autonomy.   In recent days, Amnesty and other private foreign organizationshave also expressed concern over mass arrests and killings ofanti-government demonstrators in Rangoon and other parts of thecountry.   The protestors, most from the Burman majority group, aredemanding a restoration of democracy after 26 years ofauthoritarian rule.   The latest, 25-page report said Shans interviewed by Amnestydescribed 46 alleged extrajudicial executions and 58 alleged casesof ``torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment'' in Burma'sShan State.   The information gathered, Amnesty said, also implicated soldiersof 10 Burmese infantry units as well as intelligence and policepersonnel. Most of the victims were said to be ordinary villagerssuspected of cooperating with various insurgent groups.   They ranged from a 43-year-old villager bayoneted to death onsuspicion of aiding the insurgents to four men impressed as portersfor the army who had their skulls crushed by rifle butts forfailing to to keep up with a moving troop column.   In May, Amnesty released a 71-page report detailing nearly 200victims among the Karen, Kachin and Mon ethnic minority groupsamong whom insurgency has also been rife for several decades.   Amnesty said the Rangoon government apparently has not carriedout any of the steps the organization suggested in May to preventhuman rights abuses.   ``The information available to Amnesty International remainslimited by the unwillingness of the Burmese government to grantindependent human rights investigators access to the country,'' thereport says. The Shans and others interviewed sought refuge inThailand.   The Shans, who number some 4.2 million out of the country's 38million people, began armed opposition to Rangoon in the late1950s, operating in the rugged hills of eastern Burma.   Some of the insurgent groups are described as mere traffickersin opium, which is grown in great quantity in Shan State, but thetribespeople also have a long tradition of seeking cultural andpolitical independence from the more powerful Burmans.   A number of sources in recent years have reported that theBurmese army has forced thousands of villagers into service asporters for troops battling the Shans and other rebels.   Josef Silverstein, an American author of several books on Burma,said recently that about 13,000 peasants were recruited as portersfor a major offensive against Kachin insurgents last year.   ``They were forced to walk ahead of troops in order to test formines; they were forced to carry munitions and supplies and, ifthey refused or fell, they were beaten and often killed,'' theprofessor at Rutgers University said.   Amnesty cited several examples of alleged brutal mistreatmentand killing of porters including a 30-year-old villager who fellwhile climbing up a steep slope and was stabbed to death in theback by an enlisted man.   ``The captain didn't reprimand the corporal who killed him. Thecaptain said it was a good thing because...now there was one fewerof the (Shan) bastards,'' another porter who said he saw thekilling told Amnesty.   Despite similar reports emerging from isolationist, non-alignedBurma in recent years there has been little protest fromgovernments around the world and only few official comments aboutthe recent use of armed force against civilian demonstrators.   The United States last week said it deplored the shooting ofunarmed demonstrators and urged that ``non-lethal means should beemployed to deal with such demonstrations.'' Five U.S. senatorsintroduced a resolution condemning the suppression of protest.   There has been no known reaction to the alleged human rightsabuses by Japan and West Germany, the two major aid and loan donorsto Burma.   American officials say privately the United States has normallyrefrained from sharp criticism of the Rangoon government for fearof jeopardizing its anti-narcotics program in the country. TheUnited States has supplied aircraft and chemicals which the Burmeseuse to destroy opium fields by aerial spraying.</TEXT></DOC>
