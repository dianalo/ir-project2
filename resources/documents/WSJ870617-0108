The covered wagon bore pioneers on a westward quest for prosperity. The Underground Railroad offered passage to freedom for thousands of runaway slaves. The Statue of Liberty greeted millions of immigrants who left their homes to make a new life here. A similar migration by the inner-city poor would do much to relieve their chronic unemployment, welfare dependency and attendant pathologies. It isn't happening.    University of North Carolina researcher John D. Kasarda told a Congressional Breakfast Conference last week that the inner-city poor are becoming immobilized. &quot;Without jobs and without much hope for jobs,&quot; he said, &quot;the new 'immobiles' are caught in a downward socio-economic spiral unprecedented for urban dwellers in this country.&quot;    Sociologists have a phrase for this problem -- &quot;spatial mismatch.&quot; What this means is that many jobs being created in cities -- white-collar service positions requiring at least a high-school diploma -- are beyond the immediate reach of much of the low-skilled urban population. Instead the jobs are going to professionals who are returning to the cities to take advantage of employment opportunities. U.S. migration is indeed taking place, said Mr. Kasarda, but not among the population that stands to gain the most from moving.    Not all the new jobs created in recent years require advanced skills; lower-skilled labor can fill many of them. But the inner-city poor aren't filling them because the work is often in the outlying areas of big cities or in regions with small resident populations of blacks and Hispanics. The irony is that employers are experiencing great difficulty attracting enough workers to hold these jobs. The editorial above notes that in the Pacific Northwest, the agriculture industry is wracked by a labor shortage caused in large part by the new restrictions on immigrant workers. {See REVIEW andamp; OUTLOOK (Editorial): The Immigration Law's Harvest -- WSJ June 17, 1987.}    Logic would dictate that the inner-city unemployed migrateto these areas where employment opportunities are greater forthem. Why isn't it happening?   Some sociologists point to an unwillingness to uproot family, a lack of resources, fear of unfamiliar environs and so forth. But earlier migrants faced the same obstacles and yet pushed ahead to freedom and opportunity.    A more plausible explanation of inner-city immobility may be that the incentives to stay override those to leave. Federal and state welfare programs provide free housing, free food, free health care and even free money. It's hardly paradise, but many of the poor feel they have little to gain by seeking jobs and other opportunities outside the city. Even Mr. Kasarda, a self-styled old-fashioned liberal, conceded this point.    Suggesting that social welfare may be causing more problems than it cures today obviously cuts against conventional views of how best to assist the poor. The same might have been said until recently of workfare, but the principle of requiring work in return for welfare is now widely accepted. If the inner-city poor are to be liberated from their squalor, policy makers will have to squarely face the need to restructure poverty programs so as to discourage persistent immobility. </TEXT></DOC>
