The title of this applicationis ``Cooperative Research in Coal Liquefaction.''<T3>Scope: </T3>This financial assistance award is intended to supporta program of research in coal liquefaction to produce concept level technologyin bioprocessing, integrated materials characterization research, co-processing,catalysis, novel liquefaction processes, and coal dissolution. This researchcalls for an overall research integration effort intended to serve as amechanism for the coordination of research activities and results fromvarious research tasks. Specific areas of concern are biological and materialsresearch on coal liquefaction; novel approaches to the conversion of coalto liquids; liquefaction research in pyrolysis, catalysis and coal extraction;enhanced reactivity and selectivity in coal liquefaction and coprocessingsystems, integrated coal liquefaction/characterization/modeling approach;basis resource/process evaluation; and CFFLS network/data base and a programintegration project.This proposal is for a one year period at a total estimated value of $2,797,502of which the DOE share is $1,399,930.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </T2>U.S. Department of Energy, PittsburghEnergy Technology Center, P.O.
