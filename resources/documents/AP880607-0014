Since President Reagan's wife has rarely attended such events, areporter called on her to answer a few questions.   With a giggle and a grin, the first lady demurred, saying, ``Ionly rescue people.''   The first lady's response drew a peal of laughter from reporters_ who realized she was referring to a hectic scene several daysearlier when she'd reached out to pluck a hapless reporter loosefrom the over-eager clutches of the KGB.   In a number of ways, Mrs. Reagan's first visit to the SovietUnion cast her in a defender's role.   Although it seemed odd for a woman who rarely goes to church,Mrs. Reagan used several events during the visit to make subtlepoints about religious freedom.   During a visit to the Kremlin's Assumption Cathedral _ nowadays amuseum _ the first lady questioned her guide and Raisa Gorbachevabout its use for religious services and the celebration of the1,000-year anniversary of the founding of Christendom in Russia.   She got only curt responses from the Soviet first lady, but Mrs.Reagan pursued the topic again several days later.   Upon viewing an icon named, ``The Trinity,'' during a tour of thefamed Tretyakov Gallery, she told Mrs. Gorbachev she'd arrived inthe Soviet Union on Trinity Sunday. Again, little response.   At another point, the first lady was told that before she'd come,Mrs. Gorbachev had spoken at length about the icons but failed tomention their relgious meaning.   ``I don't know how you can neglect the religious implications,''Mrs. Reagan insisted. ``I mean, they are there, when you see them.''   The first lady's propaganda points on behalf of religious freedomwere accompanied by a few propaganda points on her own behalf, aswell.   Left smarting after her Washington summit encounters with thewell-spoken and photogenic Mrs. Gorbachev, Mrs. Reagan at firstappeared intent on showing how to play the polite and well-manneredguest.   So, it seemed, a peace pact of the magnitude of the Treaty ofWestphalia had been reached.   The two women held hands, European style, as they toured theKremlin cathedral on the first day of the visit .   And afterwards, Mrs. Reagan's spokeswoman Elaine Crispen relayedquotes from a private afternoon tea in which the two pooh-poohed the``silly'' idea that there was any rivalry between them.   But it didn't last.   By Wednesday, when they toured the Tretyakov Gallery, theirequally strong wills collided as they jockeyed for position in frontof the cameras.   Mrs. Gorbachev offered reporters a ``dialogue,'' displaying heropinions of the priceless artwork, going so far as to quote Russianauthor Feodor Dostoevsky on their beauty and how they reflected theRussian soul.   This time, Mrs. Reagan appeared ready for the assertive Mrs.Gorbachev, insisting she be granted equal time. She then made herthanks known to everyone, and chatted a bit with reporters about herexperiences.   Mrs. Gorbachev backed away, allowing the first lady to have hersay.   But if body language is a barometer, judge the seating chart thatevening _ when the two men sat next to each other in the front rowof the Bolshoi's Royal Box and their ladies sat on the outside _ asfar apart from each other as they could be and contrary to normalpractice at such events.   But at the Reagan's departure, there were smiles and waves allaround.   Perhaps it is the last time the two women will meet and it reallyisn't necessary that they be friends.   Given Mrs. Reagan's newfound ability _ as her spokeswoman says _``to roll with the punches,'' it's clear Mrs. Gorbachev hasdiscovered she must allow for the moment when a U.S. first ladyinsists she be allowed her own ``dialogue.''   And through their words and appearances, each first lady hasbecome adept at getting a message across, not only at home, but totheir counterpart's homeland as well.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Susanne M.
