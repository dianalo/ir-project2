The hostages to be freed include Anglican church envoy TerryWaite, who will be freed last, after the U.S. presidential electionin November, the commercial British network said.   The Foreign Office and Iranian Embassy declined comment.   Four British parliamentarians arrived in Iran on Monday on aprivate mission arranged by Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie.The group, which says its goal is to improve relations with Iran,will return home Wednesday, said a church spokesman, speaking oncondition of anonymity.   Under the timetable, the report said, British tourist NicholasNicola, 23, arrested in September 1986 on charges of firing shotsat a checkpoint on the Iran-Pakistan border, would be the first tobe freed.   Next out of Iran would be businessman Roger Cooper, 53, who hasbeen held since December 1985 on spy charges, the report said.Neither has been tried.   ``Later this year and subject to good relations, Tehran willconsider leaning on Iranian-backed gunmen in Beirut'' to freeBritish television journalist John McCarthy and teacher BrianKeenan, the report said. Keenan is from British-ruled NorthernIreland but holds Irish nationality.   ``The source said Terry Waite will be the last to be releasedafter the American presidential elections in November,'' the radiosaid.   Waite disappeared in January 1987 while visiting Beirut tonegotiate the release of Western hostages. Eighteen foreigners noware missing in Lebanon. Terry Anderson, 40, the chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press, is the longest-heldhostage. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.   Britain says it refuses to make deals to free the hostages inLebanon. But Runcie told reporters today in London that he arrangedthe meetings in Iran because ``I feel it is our Christianresponsibility to keep talking.''   The group consists of Cyril Townsend and Robert Hicks of thegoverning Conservative Party, Tom Clarke of the Labor Party andLord Tordoff of the centrist Social and Liberal Democratic Party.   The radio said Iran was drawing up the timetable after reachingagreement with Britain on June 10 to exchange compensation fordamaged diplomatic buildings.</TEXT></DOC>
