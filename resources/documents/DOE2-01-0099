Analysis of ellipsometric data fromthese samples using the Bruggeman effective medium approximation demonstratesthat the change is due to smoothing of the surface. The improvement reachesa maximum as a function of fluence and then declines as the surface isroughened through sputter-induced topography. The smoothing effect appearsto be dependent on elastic energy deposition in the vicinity of the surface.However, if the energy density at the surface is too high, such as with1 MeV gold ions, then spike effects appears to roughen the surface beforesignificant smoothing can take place. Rotating the samples in the ionbeam does not affect the initial smoothing, or its decline, but delaysthe development of the visible roughening.</TEXT></DOC>
