<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-27-0908 </DOCNO><TEXT>The refrigerant Kaltron 11, which is used in an existing industrial ORC-plantwith a piston-type steam engine and power-heat-coupling, has been studiedwith regard to its thermal stability. There were special interests in:long time behavior of the working medium, treatment and maintenance ofthe working medium, effects of lubricating oil, criterions of plant componentslayout, operating optimization. The trials were executed under normaloperation conditions. The course of the studies was handicapped by aplant defect before the beginning of this project and by the existinglimiting conditions of the waste heat delivery from a calcining kiln.After all the ORC-plant had to be modified and rebuilt within this project,based on the knowledge of the falling out defects. According to the thermallong time stability of K11 there resulted a large dependence on watercontent in the working fluid. With fluid temperatures higher than 120degCa water content below 1 ppm has to be required. Specially selected adsorptiondrying medium and lubricating oil directly had no negative influenceon the working fluid stability, but disadvantageous effects at decompositionof the working medium were concentrated. Construction and operation ofsome plant components could be improved with regard to the working fluidstability. ORC-plant operation with high temperature at the stabilitylimit of K11 improves power generation, but simultaneously the expensefor a satisfactory plant availability must increase rapidly.
