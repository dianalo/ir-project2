Bush, in turn, calledDukakis' homestate prisoner furlough program a ``revolving door formurderers.''   The latest tough talk from the presidential candidates came oneday after they exchanged long-distance rhetorical barbs over SocialSecurity and other issues.   Dukakis told a crowd at a farm rally in Idalou, Texas, that ifhe is elected he will devote $100 million for investment in farmareas.   Recalling Bush's call for a ``kinder and gentler America'' inhis acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention,Dukakis asked if the vice president's idea of a kinder and gentlerAmerica was ``foreclosing on American farmers, letting our smalltowns die?''   ``Mr. Bush's farm policy can be summed up in five words: thefewer farmers the better. And the Republican rural developmentpolicy can be summed up in two words: tough luck.''   Dukakis said rural America is filled with ``monuments to theneglect and indifference and incompetence of Mr. Bush and hisfriends. Farms and ranches abandoned or foreclosed, banks andhospitals shut down, storefronts boarded up. Communities fightingto survive.''   Bush traveled to Paterson, N.J., to pick up the endorsement oflocal law enforcement officers, and also planned later in the dayto accept the endorsement of a Springfield, Mass., police group _his second such trip to Massachusetts in an effort to tweak Dukakis.   ``We should have much more sympathy for the victims of crimethan we have for the criminals and that's the kind of judge I'llappoint to the federal bench,'' Bush said, speaking from the stepsof the Paterson Municipal Complex.   He said Dukakis, as governor of Massachusetts, had a ``basicrevolving door program for murderers who have not even servedenough time for parole.''   President Reagan was back on the campaign trail for his vicepresident, taking up Bush's attack on Dukakis' membership in theAmerican Civil Liberties Union. In a speech prepared for deliveryin Chicago, Reagan said, ``You recall a few years back, politicalfigures had to disassociate themselves from groups on the rightwith far-out views. Isn't it now time for responsible people to dothe same thing with far-out groups on the left?''   Meanwhile, a new Gallup Poll, taken Tuesday and Wednesday among1,020 registered voters, said Bush was favored by 47 percent toDukakis' 42 percent. The poll had a 3 percent plus-or-minus marginof potential sampling error.   On Thursday, Bush dismissed Dukakis' criticisms of theRepublican nominee's vote to freeze Social Security benefits,citing a similar stance by the Democrat three years ago.   The GOP presidential nominee, turning the tables on an issue theDemocrats have used against him, said Thursday that at the NationalGovernors' Association meeting in February 1985 Dukakis voted for aresolution calling for an overall freeze of Social Securitybenefits.   Dukakis has criticized Bush for casting a tie-breaking Senatevote in May 1985 to approve legislation that included a one-yearfreeze on Social Security cost-of-living adjustments.   ``He supported exactly the same thing he was attacking me on theother night,'' Bush said referring to charges Dukakis leveledduring Sunday night's debate.   The Massachusetts governor acknowledged Thursday that he casthis vote for the resolution, but noted that initially he supporteda proposal to delete Social Security from a list of programs to becovered by a one-year freeze.   The two vice presidential candidates _ Republican Dan Quayle andDemocrat Lloyd Bentsen _ were devoting much of their time topreparing for their debate Wednesday in Omaha, Neb.   Bentsen was addressing a rally in Charlotte, N.C., and theNational Education Association in Washington, D.C. Quayle wasspending the day poring over debate briefing books and meeting withadvisers before traveling to Philadelphia tonight for the GreatAmerican Firehouse Exposition and Muster.   After a day of trading one-liners, Bush lashed out at Dukakisfor suggesting that the GOP nominee would ``raid'' the SocialSecurity trust fund to cut the federal deficit.   ``I was a little surprised to see this demagoguery from the manwho had exactly the same position that the president had on thatone-year slipping of the COLAs,'' the vice president said.   Dukakis said he voted for the overall freeze after the effort toprotect Social Security increases failed. The Democratic nomineesaid the vote was ``a general expression of my concern for thedeficit, but I made it very, very clear that I was opposed tocutting cost-of-living increases for Social Security recipients.''   Earlier in the day, Dukakis attacked the Reagan administration'srecord on the environment, using an appearance at RutgersUniversity in New Brunswick, N.J., to denounce Republican effortsto cleanup toxic waste sites and stem the tide of medical wasteswashing up on New Jersey shores.   ``For the foot-draggers and chronic polluters, I have just onemessage,'' Dukakis said. ``You better vote for Mr. Bush, because ifI'm elected the game is over _ no more of the sweetheart deals anddelayed cleanups and half-baked compromises that we've seen overthe past seven and a half years.''   Several weeks ago, Bush had traveled to New Jersey where heproclaimed, ``I am an environmentalist.''   ``Calling George Bush an environmentalist is like calling DanQuayle a statesman,'' said Dukakis who was joined by aconservationist who bristles at comments on his resemblance toQuayle _ actor Robert Redford.</TEXT></DOC>
