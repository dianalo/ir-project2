That's the ruling of the New Jersey Supreme Court, which found that an obituary that mistakenly states that a person is dead does no harm to that person's reputation and, as a result, is not libelous.    &quot;While we appreciate the shock the plaintiff may have felt in reading of her death, it was necessarily quickly dissipated by her certain knowledge that the announcement was premature,&quot; the court wrote in its 6-0 decision earlier this week.    The court cautioned, however, that a libel suit could go to trial if an erroneous obituary referred to circumstances surrounding a death that could have defamatory meaning, said Gerard Hanson of Brener Wallack andamp; Hill, Princeton, N.J., who argued on behalf of the defendant, the Princeton (N.J.) Packet.    According to Mr. Hanson, during oral arguments the court indicated that, for example, a suit over a false obituary that reported that a mayor had died from a drug overdose would be allowed to go to trial.    Mr. Hanson added that, although it was the first time the New Jersey court had dealt with such a case, &quot;There is a wealth of precedent in other jurisdictions to support the opinion.&quot;    In 1985, the twice-weekly newspaper, the Packet, printed an erroneous obituary of Marcy Decker. A year later, Ms. Decker sued the paper, claiming that her distress over the obit contributed to the loss of her job and helped her ex-husband gain custody of the couple's child. Ms. Decker's attorney, Louise Robichaud of Kingston, New Jersey, was unavailable to comment.    According to Princeton Packet editor Richard Willever, the newspaper had failed to follow its practice of verifying all obituaries when it neglected to call the family to confirm the unsigned obituary.    Mr. Hanson argued in the paper's defense that a newspaper has no legal duty to check the facts in an unsigned press release from a funeral home. </TEXT></DOC>
