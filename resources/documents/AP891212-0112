The state-run South African Transport Services dismissed 1,073strikers, raising the total fired during a six-week walkout to12,617.   Witnesses and hospital personnel said police used rubberbullets, buckshot and birdshot on about 500 strikers in Cape Townas they marched on the main railway building.   Fifty men were hospitalized and at least eight required surgery,according to officials at Groote Schuur Hospital and the GatesvilleMedical Center.   The workers had marched the same route almost daily during thestrike without serious incident. They said they did not hear anywarnings from police before the shooting began.   The explosion before dawn outside Cape Town damaged a rail lineand forced the cancellation of 30 morning rush-hour trains, thetransportation company said. Thousands of commuters were affected,the company added.   Police investigated the possibility that two bombings Mondaynight in Johannesburg were linked to the strike. One blastshattered windows in an area near the business office of thetransport company and the other killed two Indian men atJohannesburg's main railroad station.   Police on Tuesday said they found limpet mines, AK-47 rifles,hand grenades and pistols at the home of one of the slain men,Yusuf Akhalwaya, 23.   The other man, Prakash Napier, 24, was believed to be carrying alimpet mine and working with Akhalwaya when it detonatedunexpectedly, police said.   Prior to the bombings, five people had been killed instrike-related violence. There have been many arson and sabotageattacks that the company has blamed on strikers.   In Soweto, the township outside Johannesburg, a grenade thrownfrom a moving trains injured two men waiting at a station Tuesday,police said.   About 20,000 workers walked out Nov. 2, demanding the minimummonthly wage be increased from $225 to $560. The strikers also aredemanding formal recognition of their union, the South AfricanRailway and Harbor Workers Union.   Management has refused to enter wage talks, saying a pay hikewas negotiated earlier this year. The company has been firingworkers steadily and says all will be dismissed unless they returnto work.   Whites employed by the 170,000-worker company make significantlymore money for the most part and dominate administrative andsupervisory posts.   Company officials say damage to property during the strikeexceeds $8 million. But they say their rail and harbor operationshave not been seriously affected by the walkout, which is illegalunder legislation that bars strikes in essential services.</TEXT></DOC>
