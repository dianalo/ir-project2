But even here in the heartland, a mini-invasion ofJapanese is under way. Japanese investors bought a cattleranch in nearby Brady last year, touching off a ruckus thatstill hasn't abated.   &quot;I know how them Orientals think,&quot; says William Thanel,standing inside his gas station. &quot;When we lose this land, youcan't buy it back from them. It will go from generation togeneration. You'll never get it back.&quot;   &quot;Pretty soon they're going to be taking us over,&quot; agreesHelen Higginbotham, as she pours a cup of coffee at Roger'sdiner. &quot;That's what I'm worried about.&quot;   Like fast-growing kudzu vines, Japanese money is spreadingacross America, buying up tens of billions of dollars inTreasury bonds and sewage-treatment plants, skyscrapers andski resorts, grain elevators and golf courses. Japaneseinvestment in U.S. real estate has increased sevenfold since1985, while investment in manufacturing leaped to $12 billionfrom $3 billion in the same period.   The purchases have included high-profile &quot;trophies,&quot; suchas Columbia Pictures and a controlling interest inRockefeller Center, and show little sign of slowing. Unlikethe short-lived, oil-fueled Arab investment boom of the1970s, this one is driven by more fundamental causes. Highsavings rates in Japan have left the newly wealthy Japanesewith huge quantities of money to spread around the globe. LowAmerican savings rates, combined with huge budget deficits,have left the U.S. dependent on those funds.   Moreover, the dollar's steep decline in the last fiveyears has turned the U.S. into a bargain basement for theJapanese. Relatively low land and food prices and even wagesmake the U.S. seem almost like a Third World nation incomparison to Japan. Susumu Ohara, a Japanese newspaperexecutive in New York, says he arranges to get menus with noprices when treating guests from Tokyo at one of New York'smost expensive Japanese restaurants. If his guests saw theprices, he says, they would think him a cheapskate.   This deluge of Japanese money heightens the economicuncertainties gnawing at America. For decades, Americans havebeen investing heavily overseas and assuring concernedforeigners that they would benefit from the investments. Nowthat the shoe is on the other foot, Americans don't like itat all. In a recent nationwide Wall Street Journal/NBC Newspoll, 69% of registered voters said the Japanese alreadyinvest &quot;too much&quot; in the United States. In North Carolina, agroup called &quot;Help Save America for Our Kids' Future&quot; sendsout mailings claiming that &quot;Japanism&quot; has replaced communismas the major threat to the country.   Will Japanese money change the face of America, and willthe U.S. thereby lose control over its own destiny and itsinfluence abroad? That, more than the trade deficit, will bethe issue at the center of U.S.-Japan relations for the nextdecade.   There is little question that the nation's future would bemore secure if it could rely on its own capital. But as longas Americans save so little, that option is closed. &quot;BetterAmerican capital than Japanese capital,&quot; says Harvardeconomist Lawrence Summers, &quot;but better Japanese capital thanno capital at all.&quot;   Less clear is whether Japanese investment is moreworrisome than other foreign capital. Economists tend toassume business people and investors around the globe aremotivated by the same consideration of the bottom line. Butsome close observers of Japan insist the Japanese havedeveloped a different, more threatening breed of capitalism-- one driven as much by national goals as individual profit.   &quot;The Japanese have a much stronger sense of `we' and`they' than Americans&quot; and they are &quot;importing theirinsularity into the U.S,&quot; says Ivan Hall, a professor atGakushuin University in Tokyo. American employees of Japanesecompanies, for example, complain their opportunities foradvancement are slim. And American companies say Japanesefirms here favor suppliers from Japan over those in the U.S.In addition, some observers worry that Japanese companieswork to keep knowledge-intensive, high-paying jobs at homewhile situating lower-skilled jobs in the U.S. The observersalso fear that during a global downturn, the Japanese mightshift the burden of unemployment to the U.S. and away fromtheir own country.   In the end, warns C. Tait Ratcliffe, a Tokyo-basedAmerican economist and consultant, &quot;Japan could adopt a sortof industrial policy for the U.S. through its investments,&quot;deciding &quot;which industries are appropriate for America.&quot;   Many economists argue that Japanese investment is ablessing, holding down interest rates and creating jobs.Moreover, some commentators say that in the new globalmarket, ownership no longer matters. Harvard professor RobertReich argues that it is much healthier to have Sonytelevision sets made in the U.S. than Zenith televisions madein Mexico.   But as the Journal/NBC poll shows, most ordinary Americansdon't accept that sanguine view. &quot;If you think ownershipdoesn't matter,&quot; says Chalmers Johnson, a Japan specialist atthe University of California at San Diego, &quot;you are notplaying the capitalism game any more.&quot;   Here in rural Nebraska, ownership does still matter, andownership by the Japanese sparks a special ire. &quot;The Japaneseare highly visible, highly successful, and everybody isenvious of their wealth,&quot; says Don Bratten, a localstockbroker. Sentiment is so strong that, after the Japanesepurchased the ranch in Brady, the local district attorneydusted off a 100-year-old law barring sale of farm land to&quot;aliens&quot; and filed a suit, now pending, demanding that theranch be sold to the state.   George Kuroki sees an element of racism in the dispute.&quot;That law has been ignored for 100 years,&quot; says Mr. Kuroki, athird-generation Japanese-American whose family came to thisarea decades ago. At age 83, he has lived and worked as afarmer here all his life, but still decorates his house withJapanese prints and designs. &quot;Why, because a Japanesenational buys it, do they bring it up?&quot; he asks of the oldlaw.   There is also a feeling in North Platte and elsewhere inthe U.S. that the Japanese play by different rules. &quot;All theyare going to do with this land is raise beef and ship it toJapan,&quot; complains Robert Hill, a railroad worker. &quot;They needto participate more in our society.&quot;   Do the Japanese play by different rules? When MichiganState University economist Mordechai Kreinin studied theAustralian operations of 62 multinational companies -- 42 ofthem owned by U.S. or European interests, 20 by Japanese --his findings were stark. Factories owned by Americancompanies, and to a slightly lesser extent European firms,contained equipment made in America, Japan and a variety ofEuropean countries, without a pronounced national pattern. Bycontrast, the &quot;overwhelming preponderance&quot; of the equipmentused in Japanese-owned factories came from Japan, he wrote inThe World Economy, a British journal.   &quot;The Japanese are different,&quot; Mr. Kreinin says in aninterview. &quot;When an American or European company buysmachinery to set up a plant, they take competitive bids. Butthe Japanese go directly to Japan.&quot; He attributes this partlyto tradition, and partly to the so-called &quot;keiretsu&quot; --large, loosely organized groups of companies in Japan thatown each other's stock and tend to buy from each other.   American construction companies are among those that havemost keenly felt the impact of this tendency to Buy Japanese.They complain that while American firms building facilitiesin Japan generally use Japanese prime contractors, Japanesecompanies here don't reciprocate; instead, they generally useJapanese contractors.   It's the same story in the auto-parts business. Eventhough Japanese auto makers now produce more than a millionvehicles a year in the U.S., most of the parts still comefrom Japanese manufacturers. Japanese auto makers haverepeatedly promised to buy U.S. parts, and some of them nowhave set numerical targets for U.S. purchases. So far,though, the targets are small and the progress slow.   All told, according to Norman Glickman and DouglasWoodward, authors of a recent book on foreign investment inthe U.S., Japanese-affiliated companies in the U.S. imported$71.1 billion worth of goods in 1987 while exporting only$20.8 billion of goods. The difference -- about $50 billion-- was about the size of the U.S. trade deficit with Japanthat year.   Mr. Kreinin's Australian study found that, in addition topreferring Japanese suppliers, Japanese multinationals arefar more likely to rely on managers from home. Most Westernoperations he examined were managed entirely by Australians.Only one of the 20 Japanese operations was whollyAustralian-run. Even when Australian managers were used, theywere often shadowed by Japanese &quot;advisers&quot; who exercised thereal power.   Japanese government statistics partially support hispoint. They show that 45% of the top officials and 85% of thechief executives of Japanese companies' overseas subsidiariesare Japanese. Only 20% of the top officials of foreign unitsin Japan are sent by the home office.   At a Chinese restaurant in Tokyo's Roppongi district, fiveyoung Westerners who work in Japanese corporations also seemto endorse Mr. Kreinin's finding. They are members of theKaisha Society, a group formed to allow foreigners inJapanese companies to share their experiences.   Alexander Muromcew is one of the group. He studiedJapanese in Japan during and after his undergraduate years atDartmouth College, and ultimately joined Mitsui andamp; Co., a bigJapanese trading company, in New York. But the energeticyoung man quickly became discouraged. None of the topexecutives of the company, and fewer than 10% of the generalmanagers, were Americans. After he was sent to Tokyo, hesays, the company union explained to him just how differenthis employment status was from that of his Japanesecolleagues. He found that he was on a separate track tonowhere.   Mr. Muromcew says Mitsui is trying to improve conditionsfor foreigners, but he decided not to hold his breath: Lastweek, he left the company. His advice to Americans who facethe prospect of working for Japanese companies in the U.S.:&quot;You're going to be discriminated against. Do you want to bea second-class citizen in your own country?&quot;   In Tokyo, a Mitsui spokesman says the company is workinghard to increase the number of foreign managers in its employand to give overseas employees more opportunity to rise inthe company.   Peter Douglas, a Briton and another member of the KaishaSociety, is more upbeat. He admires Japanese businesspractices and enjoys Tokyo. But even he doesn't see much of afuture for foreign managers. &quot;You can learn good techniquesin a Japanese company, but they don't promote foreigners.&quot;   Japanese companies say one problem they face in movingambitious foreigners up the ladder is finding people whospeak their language well enough. Moreover, even foreignersproficient in the language may find the keenly formalcorporate culture in Japanese companies difficult to grasp. Abooklet handed to new employees by Dai-ichi Life InsuranceCo., for instance, includes complicated instructions on howto stand with superiors on an elevator, how to behave duringgolf games and how to express one's will without being toodirect. There's even a section entitled, &quot;Funeral: MostSerious Business Scene.&quot;   As for their operations in the U.S., certainly someJapanese companies are trying to mollify their hosts. WhenAmericans complained that Japanese operations in the U.S.didn't contribute much to local charities, Japan's governmentbegan mulling a tax break for overseas philanthropy. And whenAmericans complained that the Japanese hired too fewminorities and were insensitive to the concerns of blacks,Keidanren, Japan's big business group, helped produce aJapanese-television version of &quot;Eyes on the Prize,&quot; a PBSdocumentary on the civil-rights movement.   In some cases, at least, the efforts seem to be payingoff. Elaine Jolissant, an engineer at a computer-peripheralsfactory in Hillsboro, Ore., owned by Fujitsu Ltd., washesitant to work for a Japanese company, fearing that its&quot;culture isn't designed for women yet.&quot; She now insists itwas an unfounded worry. &quot;It turned out to be exactly theopposite,&quot; she says. &quot;They were very kind and respectfultoward me just like everybody else.&quot;   Fujitsu has no Americans in top management, but itsHillsboro facility is run largely by non-Japanese. And whilethe plant doesn't formally promise Japanese-style &quot;lifetime&quot;jobs, employees there feel secure. By contrast, Mrs.Jolissant says the American-owned company she left to takethe Fujitsu job closed its operations a year later and movedthem to Taiwan.   Still, even in Hillsboro, concern about the Japanese isapparent. A poll last year by William Watts, a Washingtonconsultant, found the town evenly split over whether foreigninvestment is good or bad. And a visit to McMenamin's pub atthe edge of the town makes it clear that critics of Japanaren't hard to find.   &quot;Right now, it's good for the economy,&quot; says PeteBatchelor, drinking a beer. &quot;But in the long run, I don'tknow.&quot;   &quot;We ought to stick with American companies,&quot; adds hisdrinking companion, Tom Simpson. &quot;This is America.&quot;   Try as they might to become better U.S. corporatecitizens, Japanese companies sometimes botch it. CalsonicManufacturing Corp., a Japanese auto parts supplier that hasa factory in Shelbyville, Tenn., donated $2 million to helpthe town build grounds for its walking-horse shows, somethingdear to the town's heart. There was just one hitch: Calsonicset the dedication for Dec. 7 -- Pearl Harbor Day.   Shelbyville veterans were outraged. &quot;We beat the hell outof the Japanese&quot; in World War II, says Austin Shofner, aMarine who was a Japanese prisoner of war for 11 months. &quot;Ifwe had not, we'd be crawling on our bellies now.&quot; Mr.Shofner, known around town as &quot;the general,&quot; thought themoney shouldn't have been accepted.   It was apparently Americans, not Japanese, who set thedate, and it was eventually changed. But by then, any goodwill Calsonic had bought with its $2 million had evaporated.   In the end, it will take more than good public relationsto assuage the concerns of Americans. To do that, Japanesecompanies would have to begin acting more like their Europeanand American counterparts: More non-Japanese would have to begiven prominent positions in management and more non-Japanesesuppliers would have to be awarded business.   Officials and experts in Japan say all this willeventually happen, that Japanese companies simply need moreexperience abroad. &quot;This is just the first stage ofinternational investment,&quot; says Kenji Nagano, a senior staffwriter for the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the major business andeconomic newspaper in Japan. &quot;To survive, Japanesemultinationals will have to become more international.&quot;   But Mr. Kreinin, the economist who studied Japanesecompanies in Australia, has his doubts that the culprit ismere inexperience. &quot;I don't buy that argument,&quot; he says. &quot;Inthe case of Australia, there were some {Japanese} companiesthat weren't all that new. Yet whenever they had expansionpossibilities, they went straight back to Japan&quot; for managersand suppliers.   ---   Do you think the amount of Japanese investment in the U.S.is too much, about the right amount, or too little?
