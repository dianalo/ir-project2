Torrential downpours flooded homes and streets, forcing at least800 people into Red Cross shelters and prompting dozens of motoristsstranded on impassable freeways to leave their cars.   At least two fatalities were blamed on Allison, which wasdowngraded to a tropical depression Tuesday morning. Harris CountySheriff's Department divers pulled a man's body from rain-swollenSpring Creek late Tuesday. On Monday, a traffic death in theBeaumont area was attributed to the storm.   Two major Houston freeways _ Interstate 45 and U.S. 59 _ wereclosed for more than 12 hours, blocked by high water, debris frombayous that swamped over freeway bridges and abandoned vehicles.   ``It's a helpless feeling,'' said stranded motorist Miles Nye.``There's nothing you can do. You just watch the water moving up.''   At 11 a.m. CDT, the poorly defined center of the depression wasnear 30.8 north latitude and 94.7 west longitude, or about 30 milessouth of Lufkin, moving slowly to the north-northeast.   Maximum sustained wind speed was 35 mph, with 45 mph gusts inheavy squalls, said the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables,Fla. Because rain tends to fall to the east and north of such astorm, the center said 5 to 10 inches of rain was possible overextreme southeastern Texas and western Louisiana before the stormmoved into southern Arkansas.   Although heavy rain and flooding is not unusual for Houston, theseverity of the freeway problems rivaled Hurricane Alicia, which hitin 1983, and Tropical Storm Claudette, which dumped more than 20inches of rain in 24 hours in 1979 and dropped a national single-dayrecord 43 inches in nearby Alvin.   Before water began receding Tuesday, some underpasses had as muchas 15 or 20 feet of water. A city bus was marooned in one underpassnear downtown, its roof barely visible above water.   In the Beaumont area, about 85 miles east of Houston, flash floodwarnings were posted for Orange, Jasper and Newton counties. Manymajor streets and underpasses in the Beaumont-Port Arthur-Orangearea were flooded and drainage ditches were over their banks andrising.   Forecasters warned that the Sabine River, which separates Texasfrom Louisiana, would rise significantly and threaten homes in theDeweyville area, north of Beaumont. The Neches River north ofBeaumont also was likely to be out of its banks, the NationalWeather Service said.   In southwestern Louisiana, Calcasieu and Cameron parishes wereunder flood warnings and Louisiana State Police reported a tornadoat Hackberry, La. No damage was reported.   More than 10 inches of rain fell in the Houston area during the24 hours that ended early Tuesday, according to weather servicefigures. In Pasadena and Deer Park, southeastern suburbs of Houston,more than 16 inches of rain was recorded in four days. Allison wasresponsible for 12 to 14 inches of rain in Liberty County, east ofHouston.   For the year, the nearly 39 inches of rain so far in Houston is17 over normal.   It was the second double-digit rainfall in the area in six weeks,and some of the same areas hit by a May storm were hit again byAllison.   ``We still haven't got our insurance money from last time,'' saidAlberto Ferrer, who will have to clean up his home north of Houstonyet again.   ``I've put my house up for sale four times but nobody wants tobuy a house under water,'' resident Harry Jones said.   The slow-moving storm became the first named storm of the 1989Atlantic hurricane season Monday when its maximum sustained windspeed reached 39 mph. It came ashore in Brazoria County, south ofHouston, and then inched its way through southeast Texas at about 5mph.</TEXT></DOC>
