ManuelAntonio Noriega's appointment as chief executive is just anothereffort to perpetuate his dictatorship and makes democracy an evenmore distant dream for Panama.   The general's hand-picked legislature declared Panama in a stateof war on Friday and named Noriega chief executive to combat whatit called U.S. aggression.   ``To confront this aggression, the job of chief of government ofPanama is hereby created, and Manuel Antonio Noriega is designatedto carry out these responsibilities as maximum leader for nationalliberation,'' the resolution said.   Noriega, chief of the Panamanian Defense Forces and already thepower behind the government, is wanted in the United States onfederal drug trafficking and money laundering charges.   Washington has tried to oust him from power for 2{ years withdiplomatic pressure and economic sanctions. But the general hasweathered the U.S. pressure as well as military coups attempts inMarch 1988 and in October.   The 510-member assembly's resolution says Noriega can appointpublic officials, control foreign relations, convene the assemblyand ``make decisions on whatever other matter or unforeseencircumstance'' affects the nation's interests.   ``The Republic of Panama is declared to be in a state of warwhile the (U.S.) aggression lasts,'' said the resolution, passed byacclamation by the People's Assembly.   Noriega was sworn in on the spot.   ``This designation is a new imposition of a dictatorship thatexists only to perpetuate Noriega's power,'' a statement from theDemocratic Alliance of the Civic Opposition said.   The alliance said Noriega's new title is a ``mere symbol.''   Noriega, it said, ``has been exercising unlimited power sincethe day he took command of the Defense Forces in 1983'' and theappointment shows ``the dictatorial nature'' of his regime.   It said Noriega's appointment was ``a step backward in thesearch for a democratic solution'' that would only ``serve toproduce more and more complex problems'' for Panama.   Nonetheless, the opposition reaffirmed its determinaton to``keep struggling to achieve liberty and justice for the Panamanianpeople.''   In Washington, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State LawrenceEagleburger on Friday called Noriega's appointment ``a charade andnonsense.''   ``As far as we are concerned, at least, there is no governmentin Panama anyway,'' he said.   As head of the government, Noriega holds the same title as thelate dictator Gen. Omar Torrijos, his mentor.   Noriega claims the U.S. indictments are part of a plot to renegeon the 1977 treaties signed by President Jimmy Carter and Torrijosthat turn over operation of the canal to Panama at the end of thecentury.   Noriega has propped up a succession of powerless presidentswhile he controlled the country.   Panama has not had an elected government since Sept. 1, when thelast presidential and legislative terms ended.   Elections were held May 7 to fill those spots, but Noriegaannulled the balloting before all the votes were counted.International observers said the opposition was winning by a 3-1margin.   Noriega then named Francisco Rodriguez, a friend since highschool, provisional president and appointed the nation's mayors andcounty chairmen to the People's Assembly. Rodriguez's position wasexpected to become a largely ceremonial post.   Assembly members were applauded for attacks on the UnitedStates. One asked the government for guns for all citizens``because what we have to do here is kill gringos and pro-gringos.''</TEXT></DOC>
