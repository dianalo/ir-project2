Cohen   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>05/25/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B5</SO><IN>SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR)STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)LAW AND LEGAL AFFAIRS (LAW)</IN><GV>JUSTICE DEPARTMENT (JUS)</GV><LP>   Ivan F. Boesky conceded under cross-examination that the$100 million in penalties and disgorgement of profits that hepaid the government still left him with money, and that hewas able to deduct half the money he paid the government onhis 1986 tax returns.   Mr. Boesky, who was was cross-examined for a second day bydefense lawyer Thomas Puccio in the trial of John A. MulherenJr., admitted that he was forced to give up only a portion ofthe profits he derived illegally as a result of the November1986 plea-bargain agreement in his insider-trading case. Hesaid, however, that he couldn't recall how much money he hadleft after paying the penalties.</LP><TEXT>   He also said he couldn't remember what illegal trades hemade before his plea, how much money he was worth at thetime, or whether he transferred personal assets to his wifeand children.   He couldn't recall many details of his life as a famousWall Street stock speculator, or his illegal dealings withformer investment bankers Dennis Levine and Martin Siegel,both of whom have pleaded to insider-trading-relatedfelonies.   But Mr. Boesky said he remembered &quot;very well&quot; a March 1986trade he did with Mr. Mulheren that he said was &quot;designed tohelp repay an obligation Mr. Mulheren's firm had to ourfirm,&quot; money owed as a result of illegal trades. Mr. Boeskyalso said he recalled receiving inside information fromformer Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. junk-bond wizard MichaelMilken. Mr. Milken recently pleaded guilty to six felonycounts in connection with fraudulent securities trades donewith Mr. Boesky and others.   Mr. Mulheren, the former chief of Jamie Securities Co., adefunct securities firm, is charged with 41 counts ofconspiracy, and securities and mail fraud. Mr. Boesky'scooperation led to the government's sweeping insider-tradinginquiry and to the indictment of Mr. Mulheren.   Mr. Boesky completed his testimony against Mr. Mulherenyesterday without seeming to have helped the government'scase much. Mr. Boesky is unlikely to ever take the witnessstand again in a criminal case, since virtually all of theindividuals he has implicated have pleaded guilty to crimes.Mr. Mulheren is the only individual he has implicated who haschosen to fight the charges against him at trial.   However, Mr. Boesky faces civil suits from individuals whoclaim they have been damaged by his actions. Mr. Boeskyestimated the damages claimed by those plaintiffs at $1billion. Those suits are pending.   Mr. Boesky repeatedly told Mr. Puccio that he couldn'trecall how much he earned in illicit profits without seeinggovernment documents. Mr. Boesky also said he couldn'tremember whether he had transferred money and other assets tohis family and others in 1986, prior to his guilty plea.   &quot;Do you recall what your net worth was in 1986?&quot; Mr.Puccio asked. &quot;I'd have to be refreshed,&quot; Mr. Boeskyanswered. But Mr. Boesky said he &quot;presumed&quot; his lawyers werecorrect when they told the court that he was almost bankruptin December 1987, when he was sentenced to three years inprison.   Mr. Boesky served 19 months of his prison term in afederal prison in Lompoc, Calif. &quot;Did you break any lawswhile you were at Lompoc?&quot; Mr. Puccio asked. &quot;Yes,&quot; Mr.Boesky answered. &quot;There were a couple of chaps who didlaundry there and I gave them a few quarters to do mylaundry&quot; in violation of prison rules.   &quot;Isn't it a fact that you paid bribes&quot; to prison officialsand received &quot;special consideration&quot; as a result, Mr. Puccioasked. &quot;That's an outrageous and malicious accusation, sir,&quot;Mr. Boesky answered angrily.   Mr. Boesky also denied a suggestion by Mr. Puccio that Mr.Boesky received inside information from Stephen Fraidin, thena close friend of Mr. Boesky's who is a partner at the NewYork law firm of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver andamp; Jacobson.&quot;Did you ever receive insider information from Mr. Fraidin orhis law firm?&quot; Mr. Puccio asked. &quot;Unequivocally no,&quot; Mr.Boesky responded.   In a telephone interview yesterday, Mr. Fraidin said, &quot;Anysuggestion that I provided Mr. Boesky with inside informationis outrageous, without basis and totally incorrect.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
