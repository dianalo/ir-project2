RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court ruled Tuesday thatinternational airline passengers do not have to be warned bycarriers _ even in the fine print _ that they can collect no morethan $75,000 apiece in air disasters.   In a case stemming from the Soviet downing of a Korean Air Linesjet that claimed 269 lives in 1983, the court said an airline'sfailure to alert passengers to the $75,000 limit does not expose itto greater financial penalties.   By a 9-0 vote, the justices said KAL will not be penalized forits failure to use the proper size type on its tickets to alertpassengers to the $75,000 limit.   Such warnings generally alert passengers that they must buyprivate insurance if they want additional financial protection.   While the court was unanimous in shielding KAL from largerdamages, the justices were sharply divided in granting airlineseven broader protection from costly lawsuits.   By a 5-4 vote, the court said an international agreement knownas the Warsaw Convention does not force airlines to give passengersany adequate warning on their tickets that there is a $75,000damage limit.   Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the court, said, ``TheWarsaw Convention does not eliminate the limitation on damages forpassenger injury or death as a sanction for failure to provideadequate notice of that limitation.''   In a separate concurring opinion, Justice William J. Brennantook issue with the breadth of Scalia's opinion.   Brennan said Scalia's opinion means airlines are free to givepassengers no warning at all about how much they can collect. Underthe court's decision, Brennan said, the only time an airline couldbe forced to pay more than $75,000 is ``when no passenger ticket atall is delivered.''   The ruling permits airlines to omit any warning about theirfinancial liability even in the fine print, Brennan continued.   ``Notice that is not minimally legible, at the least, is nonotice at all,'' he said.   Joining in his concurring opinion were Justices ThurgoodMarshall, Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens.   Tuesday's case has its origins with the flight of KAL Flight 7,which was en route from New York City to Seoul, Korea, when it wasshot down by a Soviet military airplane Sept. 1, 1983. The KAL jetflew more than 300 miles off course and entered Soviet airspaceover the Sea of Japan.   All aboard were killed, including Rep. Lawrence McDonald, D-Ga.   Many of the victims' families, including McDonald's widow, suedKAL in various federal courts. The wrongful-death lawsuits wereconsolidated and presented to a federal trial judge here.   Lawyers for the victims' families in 1984 asked U.S. DistrictJudge Aubrey E. Robinson Jr. to declare that KAL was not eligiblefor the $75,000-per-death cap imposed by the Warsaw Convention.   A separate private pact among airlines, the Montreal Agreement,says the notice of the $75,000 limit must be specified in printsize no smaller than 10-point type.   The KAL tickets announced the limit in 8-point type.   Robinson ruled in favor of Korean Air Lines and the U.S. CircuitCourt of Appeals here upheld his decision in 1987, dismissing thesuit by the passengers' families.</TEXT></DOC>
