Macy andamp; Co.filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, listing $4.95billion in assets and $5.32 billion of liabilities.   The filing in Manhattan federal court came less than sixyears after Macy management led a $3.7 billion leveragedbuyout of the famed chain. By entering Chapter 11, Macy isacknowledging that it can't cope with its large debts, thelingering recession and a two-year deterioration in itsoperating results.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We have known for some time that Macy's had more debtthan is desirable in such a weak economy,&quot; said Macy ChairmanEdward Finkelstein in a statement. &quot;We worked day and nightto find a suitable solution and ultimately came to theconclusion that filing for Chapter 11 was best for Macy'sfuture.&quot;   Analysts say it may take two years for the retail chain torestructure its debts and exit from bankruptcy proceedings.Early estimates are that Macy will seek to shrink itslong-term debt to $2 billion, offering part-ownership to itscreditors in exchange for debt relief. Macy currently has$3.4 billion of long-term debt.   Macy's current owners might propose to invest more moneyin the company in hopes of engineering a speedier exit andgaining control, Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. analyst Herbert Lustsaid. But executives close to one large Macy shareholder,Loews Corp., indicated that such plans aren't currently underconsideration. The Tisch family, which controls Loews, lastweek proposed to inject $1 billion into Macy, but dropped itsplans when major creditors wouldn't agree to interest ratecuts.   Macy operates 251 stores nationwide under such names asBullock's, I. Magnin, and Macy's. In its bankruptcy filing,Macy said its troubles were compounded by a bleak fallselling season, including &quot;the Christmas that never came.&quot;   Internal Macy financial data indicate that the company'scash flow -- earnings before interest, taxes, depreciationand amortization -- plunged to less than $135 million for thequarter ending Saturday. That amount, in what istraditionally Macy's strongest quarter, was barely half thetotal in the year-earlier period. After taking into accountMacy's interest bill, the company operated at a sizable netloss for the quarter.   Macy enters Chapter 11 with an estimated $275 million ofunpaid bills to trade vendors, most of which had been due tobe paid Jan. 10. Among Macy's largest trade creditors areSony Corp., owed $16.4 million; Liz Claiborne Inc., owed $6.7million, and Estee Lauder, owed $3 million.   Suppliers, however, said that it is likely Macy will beginreceiving fresh merchandise almost immediately because Macyhas negotiated $600 million in debtor-in-possessionfinancing.   The funding, critical to companies entering Chapter 11proceedings, will be provided by Bankers Trust New York Corp.and Chemical Banking Corp. The Manufacturers Hanover unit ofChemical, along with Bankers Trust, were Macy's two leadbankers in its 1986 leveraged buy-out. In addition, GeneralElectric Co.'s GE Capital unit has agreed to provide acharge-card facility that will let Macy consumers continue tocharge merchandise on Macy cards.   &quot;I would ship them $100,000 worth of goods as soon as theyhave a debtor-in-possession number,&quot; said Martin Axman,president of Item Eyes Inc., a maker of women's sportswear,jackets and slacks. &quot;The door is wide open. Our sales peoplehave already begun calling Macy and asking them in to see ournew spring line.&quot;   Howard Bloom, president of Chetta B Inc., a maker ofexpensive women's apparel, said Macy owes his company about$50,000 for goods shipped in December. However, Mr. Bloom,like other vendors, said he was taking the filing in stride.&quot;Retailers added too much debt, based on overly optimisticsales projections,&quot; said Mr. Bloom. &quot;The problem with theMacy filing is that it is going to make consumers think thatthe economy is worse than it is. This is another blow toconsumer confidence.&quot;   The Macy bankruptcy case will be handled by Judge BurtonLifland, who is generally regarded as a pro-debtor judge,rather than a pro-creditor one. Judge Lifland previouslyhandled the bankruptcy filings of Eastern Airlines Inc. andLTV Corp.   Macy's Chapter 11 filing yesterday sent prices of itsthree junk-bond issues reeling. The biggest drops were postedby Macy's zero-coupon bonds due 2006, which plunged 16 centson the dollar, to about 14 cents on the dollar.   Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. was widely rumored on Wall Street toown at least $100 million face value of the Macy zero-couponbonds. Morgan Stanley's head of junk-bond trading, PeterKarches, said the firm does own some Macy bonds, but in farsmaller amounts than rumored.   Emerging from Chapter 11 may prove more trying for Macythan Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp.Those chains filed for bankruptcy protection in January 1990and are expected to emerge as a single, publicly tradedcompany early next month.   &quot;What makes this filing different is that there are activeequity players here who will make a quick and consensualrestructuring difficult,&quot; said Rick Cieri, a partner in JonesDay Reavis andamp; Pogue, the law firm that provided counsel toFederated and Allied. &quot;People invested big money in Macyrecently and aren't going to want to walk away.&quot;   In contrast, he says, Federated and Allied equity holdersstepped aside and let a reorganization proceed.   In the Federated and Allied filings, most of thenegotiations involved different classes of bondholders, Mr.Cieri added. If Macy's current owners and bondholders can'tresolve their differences, he added, competing plans ofreorganization may eventually be filed with the bankruptcycourt. That could cause Macy's reorganization to stretch outfor years.   Operationally, many believe that Macy will benefit fromthe filing. The retail chain will be able to break its leasesand close unprofitable stores without penalty. Widespreadclosings aren't expected, but, Bear Stearns's Mr. Lust said,Macy may choose to shut a few stores.   Further, because Macy won't be paying interest on itsdebt, it may have more funds with which to invest in storerenovations and newer computer systems.   &quot;Macy still has a strong following, and its stores are ingood locations,&quot; said George Ashur, vice president ofcorporate bond research, Chase Securities, a unit of ChaseManhattan Corp. &quot;Macy's access to capital had been severelyrestrained; now they will be able to invest in modernizingstores and new technology. The new Macy will be sleeker, andultimately, stronger.&quot;   For the fiscal year ended last Aug. 3, Macy had a loss of$155 million on revenue of $6.76 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
