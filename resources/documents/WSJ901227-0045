He runs the unemployment office.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We're filing more claims now than we ever have before,&quot;says Mr. Williams, whose lobby has been so crowded latelywith laid-off construction and factory workers that his staffis processing them in groups rather than individually.   Growing unemployment lines may be commonplace in much ofthe country, but they are shocking to California'sfastest-growing region, the self-proclaimed &quot;Inland Empire&quot;of Riverside and San Bernardino counties. Here, populationsoared an astonishing 60% in the past decade as Los Angelenosmigrated eastward in search of reasonably priced housing, andjobs followed. With 2.5 million people now living in theregion, the phone company is considering giving it its ownarea code.   Rapid growth has driven California out of -- or evenaround -- past slumps. But this time, the growth engine isstalling.   &quot;I'm not so sure we can rely on the Golden State's goldenpast to carry us through this recession,&quot; says RiversideCounty Supervisor Kay Ceniceros, who worries that the localeconomy has become too dependent on a single industry,construction.   Although building is slumping throughout California, theeffects of the slide are most pronounced in the InlandEmpire, which was transformed almost overnight intosprawling, tile-roofed suburbias replete with strip malls anddrive-through restaurants.   The region's roots were in agriculture. The navel orangewas developed in Riverside, and California's first vineyardwas in nearby Ontario. The area also was known for itstransportation arteries: The Atchison, Topeka andamp; Santa Fe cutthrough here, and famous Route 66 winds through SanBernardino on its way to Chicago. The Hollywood set helpedestablish the Inland Empire as a weekend spot, with sunningin Palm Springs and skiing in the mountain resorts of LakeArrowhead and Big Bear.   But not until the 1980s, when the price of much Californiareal estate shot into the stratosphere, did the Inland Empiretake off. Just as Orange County blossomed in the 1970s as abedroom community of Los Angeles, this area mushroomed in the1980s. Moreno Valley, a suburb east of Riverside with 116,000people, had scarcely any inhabitants a decade ago.   About 10% of the workers in the Inland Empire -- some71,000 people -- are in construction, and they are sufferingthe most. The number of building permits for new houses hasdropped more than 30% from 1989, and home sales have fallenan equal amount. Layoffs in construction and relatedindustries helped lift the region's unemployment rate to 7.1%in October, well above the statewide rate of 6% and above thenational rate as well.   &quot;I remember going to meetings of office-park developers inother parts of the country and hearing how bad things weregoing. But we just didn't see it,&quot; says Willard W. &quot;Skip&quot;Morris, president of a Chevron Corp. unit that has beentransforming the old Ontario Motor Speedway into a businessand housing development. &quot;It wasn't until the early part ofthis year that we saw we'd have many of the same types ofproblems here.&quot;   Joseph L. Borrie, a Riverside bankruptcy attorney, hasbeen sought out by more and more small-business owners inrecent weeks. &quot;I just had four separate furniture stores filewithin a week and a half of one another, and they were allestablished businesses,&quot; he says. &quot;I think there's going tobe a horrible flood of filings after the holidays.&quot;   Growth in the Inland Empire hasn't stopped, of course; ithas just slowed down. In fact, economists say the region isprobably the best-positioned in Southern California toweather a recession. &quot;Compared with the rest of the state andthe nation, the outlook for the Riverside-San Bernardinometropolitan area is highly positive,&quot; says Phillip Vincent,a First Interstate Bancorp economist.   Wages here are well below those of Los Angeles and Orangecounties -- as much as 35% lower, according to one survey --and that, along with the ample supply of jobseekers, willkeep new businesses coming in. With the average home price of$146,255 in November -- compared with $225,600 in Los Angelesand $239,671 in Orange County -- growth will eventually pickup again. Even with the drop in construction, some 25,000single-family homes were built here this year, more than inany other metropolitan area in the nation.   &quot;The Inland Empire will be the last area to go into therecession and the first to come out,&quot; boasts Inland EmpireEconomic Council President Steve Pon-Tell.   Nonetheless, the prospect of being first out offers littlecomfort to people now caught in the undertow.   &quot;Basically, the name of the game is survival,&quot; says DonaldBilletts, who has slashed the staff at his J.D. Trimfinished-carpentry firm in Chino to 45 from 70 in the pastyear to cope with a 50% drop in new business. &quot;My bankerasked what my bottom line will be this year. I told him ifI'm lucky, it'll be zero.&quot;   Peter Olah has laid off more than half the staff of hisexcavation company in Upland and briefly considered closingdown temporarily. Steven Alexander, executive vice presidentof Superior Electrical Contractors in Redlands, had to slashhis staff to 45 from 150 and is moving his headquarters to anold house to save on rent. And Paul Friedman had to stopbuilding a 462-unit housing tract in Lake Elsinore whenfinancing dried up.   &quot;Of our four lenders, one was taken over by the RTC {thefederal Resolution Trust Corp.}, one filed for Chapter 11,the third went out of business just as they were processingour loan, and the fourth was taken over by another companythat wouldn't lend,&quot; Mr. Friedman complains.   Without the $4 million needed to start construction, hisprojected community is nothing more than rows of graded lotsgouged out of a lifeless hillside. Mr. Friedman also ishaving trouble paying subcontractors. &quot;We normally pay themin 30 days or less,&quot; he says. &quot;Now we're double that. Andwe're some of the good guys.&quot;   Like shockwaves from the San Andreas fault, which bisectsthe region, the homebuilding slump has jolted the localeconomy, leveling some businesses while sparing others. &quot;Adisproportionately large percentage of the economy is beingaffected by the slowdown in construction, whether you selldrapes, build cabinets or do landscaping,&quot; says StephenAlbright, president of a nonprofit company that tries tobring employers into the Riverside area.   The downturn has been particularly hard on the Deleofamily. Joe Deleo makes clay roof tiles at a small factory inLake Elsinore. Business &quot;stinks,&quot; the gruff, 76-year-oldfamily patriarch says. He has fired his sales staff and mayhave to idle one of the plant's two kilns. Fifteen miles upthe road, Mr. Deleo's son and grandson are watching theirCorona Clay Co. crumble. Brick and pipe makers have stoppedordering clay, contractors are failing to pay for ordersfilled months ago, and the company laid off about 20 workers.   Surprisingly, retailers here don't seem to be sufferingnearly as much as those elsewhere in the country, partlybecause new shopping centers haven't been added as fast asthe population has grown. Harris Co., a San Bernardinodepartment-store chain with eight locations, is still posting&quot;healthy increases&quot; in sales, says Geoff Engel, a vicepresident.   In addition, companies that specialize in heavyconstruction, such as San Bernardino-based Kasler Corp., arebenefiting from much-needed additions to local roads andsimilar projects. And industrial and commercial developershaven't been as hard hit as homebuilders. Sales and leasingof industrial space in the third quarter totaled 4.3 millionsquare feet, up from 2.8 million a year earlier.   Demand is still strong for the lowest-priced homes, whichsell for under $100,000 in Victorville and Adelanto, some 90miles from downtown Los Angeles. H. Lawrence Webb, whooversees Kaufman andamp; Broad Home Corp.'s activities in theInland Empire, says that although move-up housing is a toughsell, &quot;affordable housing is selling well.&quot;   However, not all those buying cheaper housing arefirst-time buyers. Robert Chamberlain, relocation coordinatorfor Associated Van andamp; Storage in San Bernardino, says, &quot;Peopleare downgrading their homes, moving from a $200,000 house toa $150,000 house.&quot; He says business has been brisk latelybecause &quot;our busiest times are during recessions. It's kindof sad, but that's the way it is.&quot;   Manufacturers here are also feeling the pinch. The InlandEmpire is a center for recreational-vehicle and mobile-homemanufacturers, which have been suffering from a sales slump.Riverside-based Fleetwood Enterprises Inc., which employs2,000 people here, is cutting its workers' hours and givingthem &quot;a little more time off&quot; during the holidays, afterearnings in its Oct. 28 quarter fell 50%. Other RV firms arelaying off hundreds of employees.   Defense and military workers have it tough, too. GeneralDynamics Corp. will lay off 2,800 missile-plant employees inthe area over the next year. Other defense contractors areconsidering cuts, and newer plants in the Inland Empire couldbe hit harder than older ones in Los Angeles and Orangecounties, First Interstate's Mr. Vincent says.   Looming on the horizon, the Air Force plans to closeNorton Air Force Base in San Bernardino and George Air ForceBase near Victorville by mid-decade, wiping out as many as12,000 civilian and military jobs. And that doesn't includethe three local jobs that economists say could be lost forevery one at the bases.   The blow could be softened if the Air Force selects MarchAir Force Base in nearby Moreno Valley for its Space SystemsDivision, bringing in 7,500 jobs and allowing another 2,500employees to keep working at Norton. Last summer, moreover,Lockheed Corp. agreed to locate part of itscommercial-airplane maintenance business to a hangar on thebase.   Local officials hope that, with retraining, some laid-offaerospace workers can find other manufacturing jobs. &quot;Westill have new companies moving in,&quot; says John Mooney,director of Ontario's Employment Training Agency. Among thenewcomers is Exquisite Form, a brassiere maker that plans tooffer 100 jobs. However, he concedes that machinists used tomaking missiles for $20 an hour aren't likely to become bramakers for $5 an hour.   Just how bad the area downturn looks depends on one'sperspective. Ralph Menga, deputy director of Riverside'sDevelopment Department, left a Little Rock, Ark., developmentfirm to move here last year. Compared with Little Rock, where&quot;six of the seven lending institutions in the city wereeither bankrupt or in the hands of the federal regulators,&quot;the Inland Empire seems to be upholding the California mythof a recession-proof economy, Mr. Menga says. &quot;Things arecertainly slowing here, but it's nowhere near as bad asaround the rest of the country,&quot; he adds.</TEXT></DOC>
