WIELAARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Socialist and environmentalistcandidates in several nations and extreme rightists in West Germanywere the major winners in elections for the 12-nation EuropeanParliament, vote results showed Monday.   The Socialists took 182 seats in the elections, remaining thelargest group in the 518-member assembly that meets in Strasbourg,France. They picked up 16 seats, 13 from Britain, where Laboritestrounced Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives.   Greens, who focus on environmental issues and often vote alongthe same lines as the Socialists, won 17 more seats to take theirtotal to 37. And although Communists lost seven seats, their totalof 41 was still enough to take the three left-wing parties to amajority of 260.   Contrasting the left's performance was a rise in extremerightists, who won 23 seats in the consultative body, up seven.   West Germany's Republican Party, led by Franz Schoenhuber, a66-year-old former Waffen-SS soldier, entered the assembly with atleast six seats.   He called the showing of his party, which campaigned for cuts inthe number of foreign workers and a stop to the influx of asylumseekers, as ``the biggest sensation of the postwar era.''   In the European Parliament, his party will join France'slike-minded National Front Party of Jean-Marie Le Pen, which held onto its 10 seats, and four extreme right-wingers from Italy.   The biggest loser was Mrs. Thatcher's Conservatives, who lost 13of their 45 seats to Labor. Labor surged from 32 to 45 seats, givingMrs. Thatcher her first defeat in a national ballot since takingpower a decade ago and fueling charges that her free-marketrevolution is no longer working.   ``The results were disappointing, but we shall renew our effortsfor next time,'' she said.   In West Germany, the ARD-TV network called the victory by theextreme-right ``a warning signal for our democracy.''   The leader of the West German Jewish community, Heinz Galinski,called the vote a ``sad confirmation of a alarming trend ofright-wing extremism'' in the nation.   ``I am not satisfied with the vote result,'' said ChancellorHelmut Kohl, whose Christian Democrats and the Bavarian sisterparty, the Social Christians, fell from 34 to 32 seats.   West German Greens looked set to win eight seats, an increase ofone.   While the makeup of the Parliament, especially the allocation ofseats for small parties, must still be completed, near-final resultsgave this picture of election results in other EEC nations:   In Greece, the Conservative New Democracy party, which beat PrimeMinister Andreas Papandreou's governing Socialist PASOK party innational balloting, won 10 seats, up one. PASOK dropped from 10seats to eight.   In France, President Francois Mitterrand's Socialists won twoseats, going to 22. The center-right coalition of former PresidentValery Giscard d'Estaing outdistanced the Socialists, capturing 26seats. The National Front was third with 10 seats, and the FrenchGreen Party entered the assembly for the first time with nine seats.   In Italy, the Socialists went from 12 to 14 seats and theChristian Democrats held steady at 27 seats. The Communists droppedfive of their 27 seats but remained the country's second largestparty.   Italy's two Green parties won seven seats, a gain of two.   In Spain, Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez's Socialists lost aseat, dropping to 27. The opposition Conservatives fell from 17 to15 and the Communists picked up one seat for a total of four. Greencandidates won two seats.   Danish Prime Minister Poul Schlueter's Conservatives lost two oftheir four seats while the opposition Socialists won two, givingthem five seats.   The governing Christian Democrats in Belgium and the Netherlandswon seven and 10 seats, gains of one and two seats respectively.   In Brussels, Christian Democrat Leo Tindemans resigned asBelgium's foreign affairs minister Monday. He said last week hewould seek the job of European Parliament president.   Voting in the European elections took place in Spain, Britain,Denmark, the Netherlands and Ireland on Thursday. On Sunday, peoplevoted in the other EEC nations _ Belgium, West Germany, Greece,France, Luxembourg, Italy and Portugal.   The European Parliament is elected every five years. This year,142 million Europeans cast a ballot.   Throughout the European Economic Community, about 58.7 percent of220 million Europeans eligible voted, down from 61 percent in the1984 elections.   They voted for 7,126 candidates from 178 national politicalparties.   The Parliament meets one week each month in Strasbourg.   Recent polls have shown that many of the 325 million people inthe EEC consider the Parliament little more than a debating society,but reforms adopted in July 1987 give it more power.   It can veto some EEC treaties with other countries; amend orreject the annual budget; fire the EEC's 17-member ExecutiveCommission; and delay an opinion on proposed laws, thus preventingthem from taking effect.</TEXT></DOC>
