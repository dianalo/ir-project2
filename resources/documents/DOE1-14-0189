The effects of of thesecontrols are examined and it is argued that, in general, energy policyobjectives embodied in the industry's financial targets have been overriddenby macro-economic policy objectives incorporated in the industry's EFLs.Future prospects for achieving energy policy objectives in the electricitysector are reviewed.</TEXT></DOC>
