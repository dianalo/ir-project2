Alan McMillan, engineer of the Massachusetts Bay TransportationCommuter Rail Train No. 110, has been told to stop talking topassengers over the public address system.   The 42-year-old McMillan, a railroad man since he was a teen-agerand an engineer for 15 years, began his commentaries soon aftertaking over No. 110 two years ago. He began by making occasionalobservations about the weather and other things as the train passedthrough marshlands leading into Boston.   He expanded his repertoire last month after returning from avacation that included a train ride from Chicago to Seattle duringwhich he heard a club-car attendant recite poetry as part of hisannouncement he was closing the bar.   ``I thought, `Wow, what a great idea,''' McMillan said.   And he began short readings, usually poetry and always somethinghe considered upbeat.   He read while he drove the train through a work zone at 2 mph andkept one hand on the brake.   Passengers thanked him as they walked past his cab, and theywrote letters commending him. One called him ``the goodwillambassador of the commuter rails.''   But after pulling into North Station on Wednesday morning,McMillan said an Amtrak supervisor told him unnamed higher-upswanted him to stop. The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authorityhires Amtrak to run its commuter trains.   ``He told me the feeling is that somebody, someday, is going tosay something like, `How is he going to be able to drive the trainwhile doing that sort of thing?''' McMillan said.   The Boston Globe said the Amtrak supervisor, Wayne Laxton,declined to discuss the matter, but transit authority spokesmanPeter Dimond said his agency was concerned after the newspaperinquired about McMillan's popularity.   Dimond said officials thought what McMillan was doing was adirect violation of regulations.   ``Engineers are expected to give undivided attention to drivingthe train and not doing anything but driving the train,'' he said.   Earlier, McMillan said: ``I have not been seeking notoriety. Ibegan because I noticed that people getting off the train were neversmiling, that it always seemed to be `back to the salt mines' forthem ... I do this because of the positive effect that it has onpeople.''</TEXT></DOC>
