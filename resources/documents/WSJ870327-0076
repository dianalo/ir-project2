In an internal memorandum to members, the Merc disclosed its plans to impose the unusually heavy fine as part of a crackdown on a common practice by pit traders -- directing many personal trades to the same group of brokers.    Such groups, known as broker networks, are required to register with the exchange, but otherwise have been permitted to trade freely among themselves. While the networks offer some advantages for customers, critics say they invite certain kinds of abuses.    The stiff penalties are the latest in a series of Merc proposals aimed at resolving complaints from Wall Street customers, legislators and Merc members about alleged trading abuses. Nearly 400 brokers last month petitioned the Merc to bar brokers from trading for their own as well as customers' accounts, a practice known as dual trading.    The exchange is intent on averting interference by regulators in its teeming Standard andamp; Poor's stock-index pit, which accounts for about 75% of the trading in the booming stock-index futures market.    Exchange officials said they had been weighing several proposals to rein in brokers' trading practices before receiving the membership petition Feb. 25. The Merc said it would implement its proposed changes if the membership votes, in a poll scheduled for April 13, to reject the petition's call to ban dual trading by brokers. Merc officials say they are confident the petition will be rejected.    As reported, the Merc also is proposing to prohibit brokers standing on the top step of the terraced Sandamp;P 500 pit, where customer orders enter the pit, from trading for their own accounts. The Merc would also require Sandamp;P 500 brokers trading for their own accounts to manually record the time of their trades to the nearest minute.    William Brodsky, Merc president, said the exchange is &quot;trying to level the playing field for all parties&quot; by restricting trading among brokers' groups. He noted that the brokers' group restrictions are the only reform proposals to date that apply to the entire Merc floor, rather than just the Sandamp;P 500 pit.    The Merc proposes that a member of a broker group be limited to making no more than 15% of his personal trades with other members of the same brokers' group. A 25% limit would be placed on directing customer orders to fellow broker group members.    The fine of as much as $50,000 would apply to brokers exceeding the 15% limit on directing personal orders to members of their broker group. Lesser fines of from $1,000 to $10,000 apply to brokers directing more than 25% of customer orders to their broker group.    Brokers' groups have been formed at the Merc in recent years to provide customers with the ability to trade in a number of pits at the Merc by contacting a single source. Other brokers not in groups complained that the groups didn't expose their orders to the entire trading pit as required by the Merc's &quot;open outcry&quot; trading rules.    Independent brokers claimed that groups often prevented them from taking the other side of orders sent to the groups. They also alleged that certain groups at times cheated customers by executing orders among themselves rather than taking a better price offered by other brokers in the pits.    The Merc also proposed that the principals of broker groups be held personally liable for rule violations and fines levied against other, usually younger, group members. The Merc also proposed that the group principals be liable for trading errors or losses caused by other members on behalf of the group.    The exchange said that a committee will be appointed by the Merc board to hear charges of violations of these proposals and to monitor trading under the new rules. The Merc also proposed that group members not be allowed to serve on the same disciplinary or pit committee. </TEXT></DOC>
