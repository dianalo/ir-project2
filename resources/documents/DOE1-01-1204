Attempts to encouragethe general public to understand nuclear issues have also been discouraged,nuclear knowledge being kept as the preserve of the experts and policymakers, especially in the military applications of nuclear power. Itmay be that publications are suppressed or careers are destroyed. Oneexample highlighted in the article is of Dhirendra Shama, a critic ofIndia's nuclear policy, who was suddenly transferred from the Centreof Studies in Science Policy at his University to the School of Languages.Other examples are given from other countries - Australia, Britain, Canada,Federal Republic of Germany, India, Japan, New Zealand, Soviet Union,Sweden and the United States of America. The main 'crime' of those victimisedis not in having critical views, but in alerting the general public tothose critical view and ideas.</TEXT></DOC>
