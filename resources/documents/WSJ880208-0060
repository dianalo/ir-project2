Mandamp;G, Birmid's largest institutional holder, called the price inadequate. Blue Circle, a major British cement maker, said Friday it has boosted its stake in Birmid, a British maker of heating equipment, lawn mowers and gas ovens, to 38.2%.    HILLSDOWN HOLDINGS PLC, a British foods producer, has taken a 3.57% stake in the British commodities group TATE andamp; LYLE PLC, the latter company said. Officials of the companies couldn't be reached for comment, but analysts said Hillsdown appeared to have taken the stake for investment purposes.    MOUNTLEIGH GROUP PLC and PHOENIX PROPERTIES andamp; FINANCE PLC, two British property companies, announced plans to merge following Phoenix's acceptance of Mountleigh's #61.6 million ($108.6 million) acquisition offer.    VICTOR CO. OF JAPAN, which is known as JVC, said its joint venture with the THOMSON GROUP of France plans to close a British plant that assembles videotape recorders and makes some parts for the VTRs. A JVC spokesman said the closure is part of the venture's plan to streamline operations amid strong competition in the European VTR market from Asian manufacturers. The British managers of the plant are negotiating to buy it from the venture. </TEXT></DOC>
