The suit sets the firms' liability at more than $185 million.    The firms are Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., Salomon Brothers Inc., County Natwest Government Securities Inc., Greenwich Capital Markets Inc. and Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co.    The firms have all said that West Virginia's suit is without merit. On Friday, the firms filed a suit against West Virginia in New York state court asking for a declaratory judgment absolving them of liability. That suit is pending.    The suits relate to a $200 million loss, disclosed in December, that was suffered by West Virginia's consolidated investment pool. The pool invested idle cash for many state agencies and local governments.    In its suit, the attorney general's office alleges that brokers encouraged members of the treasurer's office to engage in high-volume, high-risk transactions that benefited the brokers. </TEXT></DOC>
