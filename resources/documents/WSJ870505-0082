For every 1,000 women age 15 to 44, there were only about 65 births, a fertility rate 2% lower than in 1985.    Despite a 1% increase between 1985 and 1986 in the number of women of childbearing age, the National Center for Health Statistics estimates that the number of births in the U.S. declined by 18,000 to 3,731,000. That means that the 58 million women age 15 to 44 today are producing fewer babies than only 36 million women produced at the height of the baby boom in 1957.    The drop reverses a steady increase in annual births throughout the first half of the 1980s. If that trend had continued it would have meant a return to the birth levels of 30 years ago when more than four million babies were born each year. The decline in births will probably deepen as the large group of baby-boom women, most of whom are now more than 30 years old, age beyond their prime childbearing years.    Another important difference between the 1950s and now is that nearly half of all children born today are first children as opposed to only about one in four during the baby boom. So even though the number of births is dropping, the number of married couples with children is increasing. Since parents typically spend substantially more on their first child, consumer spending on goods and services for children should continue to increase.    Some economists say the changing composition of married-couple families -- more first or only children and higher spending per child -- temporarily hides the long-term negative economic impact of this historically low birth rate. So as births continue to decline, and family composition stabilizes, the public may call for the federal government to follow the lead of some European and Asian countries and begin to offer financial incentives to encourage couples to have more children, and thus spur economic consumption.    Working Women   One of the fastest growing segments of the labor force has been married women with children. The result is that now two-thirds of the 27 million working couples have children under age 25 at home.    In the past most two-earner married couples of working age were either childless or empty nesters with their children grown and out of the home. But now most working couples have the twin burdens of work responsibilities and parental obligations. They are either full nesters (those 13 million couples with children under age 18 only) or &quot;crowded nesters&quot; -- those five million couples who may have some younger children but also have one or more age 18 to 24 still living at home.    Despite the time and emotional commitments that children require, it is fair to assume that two-income married couples with kids spend substantial time at work because they have the highest incomes of any household type. According to an analysis of the Census Bureau's 1986 Current Population Survey, 44% of the households of two-income couples with children under age 25 have incomes of more than $40,000 a year.    This suggests that in addition to purchasing time-saving goods and services, more two-earner couples may seek ways to relieve the stress of multiple commitments, thus fueling demand for travel, entertainment, and other services that offer mini-breaks from the daily grind.    Who's Dining Out?   Older Americans are a growing share of the dining-out market. People age 50 and older account for 33% of all breakfast and dinner customers and 26% of lunch patrons, according to the 1987 Gallup Annual Report on Eating Out.    Older Americans still don't patronize restaurants as frequently as their younger counterparts -- on an average day, 29% of older Americans eat out compared with 36% of all adults. But they are catching up. Since 1978, eating out has increased by 6% overall, but it is up 21% among people age 50 and older. And mature diners are patronizing fast-food places and cafeterias substantially more than they did in 1978, the survey found.    As more elderly eat out, restaurateurs may need to change their menus, pricing, and service to meet age-driven preferences. For example, older diners are more than twice as likely to order seafood as those age 18 to 24, or 35 to 49, but are less likely to want an extensive menu or wine list and are less than half as likely as those two age groups to purchase take-out food. </TEXT></DOC>
