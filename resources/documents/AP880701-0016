The disagreements over how well off Americans really areoccurred as Dukakis prepared to visit a United Auto Workers unionhall in Dayton, Ohio, and Bush returned to his vacation home inKennebunkport, Maine, for a celebration of his mother's 87thbirthday today.   Dukakis was returning tonight to Boston, where he and his wife,Kitty, planned to celebrate the Fourth of July with Jesse Jacksonand his wife, Jackie.   Jackson, who has pressed for an offer of the No. 2 position onthe Democratic ticket, will meet Monday night with Dukakis, saidDayton Duncan, Dukakis' campaign press secretary. The aide gave noindication what the two might discuss.   The Massachusetts governor faced continued heat from opponentsin the Statehouse who criticized him for campaigning while thestate ended its fiscal year with a nearly $400 million deficitThursday and without a budget for the next year. A series of taxbills and fee-raising measures to help the state pay for expandedspending in fiscal 1989 was nearing enactment.   Bush told a luncheon group in New York that paid $10,000 acouple to hear him speak that the country has been enjoying aneconomic recovery since late 1982, the longest peacetime expansionin history. He said that two years ago economists predicted adownturn that hasn't arrived.   ``Wrong, wrong, wrong,'' Bush said. ``No wonder it's called the`dismal science.'''   Bush said: ``Liberals promise compassion but they delivermisery.''   Dukakis told employees at a Reynolds Aluminum Co. plant outsideChicago that the average weekly wage for jobs lost between 1979 and1985 was $440, while the average weekly pay for new jobs duringthat period was only $270.   ``Too many of our families are struggling to hold on, challengedby change, anxious about their jobs, burdened by the rising costsof health care and housing and college tuition, troubled by thelack of quality affordable child care,'' Dukakis said.   Republicans meeting in Los Angeles to draft a party platformcriticized the Democrats' platform document as lacking content andtrying to conceal a tax and spend policy.   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas said the Democratskept their platform short because ``they don't have much to talkabout. ... I mean, who wants to talk about raising your taxes andmore regulation and more spending?''   Dole, asked if he wanted the No. 2 job, said: ``I don't thinkit's a question of wanting it. ... It's a question of winning theelection, helping your party and trying to help your country. I'dwant to be majority leader if I had my choice.''   Rep. Jack Kemp of New York told reporters at the meeting he doesnot expect to be picked by Bush as a running mate, but said Dolemight be.   ``I'm not after it because I don't think it's going to beoffered,'' said Kemp, adding that from ``all of the signals, all ofthe press reports coming out of the Bush campaign, it sounds to melike they're leaning to Bob Dole.''   Dukakis won the backing Thursday of the political actioncommittee of the National Education Association, the nation'slargest teacher union. The 1.9-million member union's board isscheduled to meet today and almost certainly concur with the PAC'schoice.   NEA officials said the endorsement applies only to theDemocratic nomination. The union won't make a final presidentialendorsement until Sept. 8, after both parties have held theirconventions.   Jackson refused to comment on whether he would use the Dukakisvisit to disclose whether he wants to pursue the second spot on theticket.   ``At this point, I will simply pursue the process and convey myprivate conclusions to Gov. Dukakis'' later, he said.   Bush and Dukakis played a game of role reversal Thursday inresponse to a pair of polls that showed the two candidates tied orBush trailing Dukakis only slightly. Earlier polls have givenDukakis double-digit leads.   ``I can only say what I've been saying for 16 months,'' Dukakissaid. ``Early polls are meaningless.''   Bush, in New York, declared ``I'm feeling like Harry Truman,''and depicted himself as a comeback winner.</TEXT></DOC>
