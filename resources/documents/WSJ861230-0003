Col. Oliver North told Justice Department investigators last month that a senior Israeli government official first suggested diverting profits from the sales of arms to Iran to Nicaragua insurgents, Reagan administration officials said.    Attorney General Edwin Meese disclosed Lt. Col. North's comments during secret congressional testimony earlier this month, according to administration officials. But according to these officials, Justice Department investigators have failed to independently confirm those assertions. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and other Israeli cabinet members have categorically denied that they participated in or knew about the diversion of funds to the Contras, as the Nicaragua rebels are known.    In the past few weeks, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Justice Department investigators have interviewed U.S. and Israeli officials in an unsuccessful effort to verify Lt. Col. North's version of the sequence of events, U.S. officials said yesterday. Lt. Col. North reportedly made his comments when Mr. Meese and other Justice Department officials first confronted him with allegations of diverting money to the Contras. The interview occurred at the end of November, administration officials said. Lt. Col. North was fired Nov. 25.    Israel's role in selling arms to Iran has been known for at least two months, but it wasn't known that U.S. investigators also were looking into possible Israeli involvement in funneling money to the Contras.    In July 1985, David Kimche, an Israeli Foreign Ministry official, met with then National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane and discussed possible arms sales to Iran. There was some discrepancy between the U.S. and Israeli versions of what occurred at those talks, but neither Mr. McFarlane nor Israeli officials have suggested that the issue of helping the Contras came up.    An administration official familiar with the investigation said Lt. Col. North specifically mentioned Mr. Kimche during the November interview.    Justice Department investigators, however, suspect that Lt. Col. North's comments, made under stress just before a criminal investigation of his activities began, may have been designed to discourage Justice Department officials from concentrating on his role in the Iran-Contra affair.    Administration officials and congressional investigators previously questioned the accuracy of a chronology of the arms sales that Lt. Col. North prepared for the White House. Lt. Col. North's version of other events appears to conflict with sworn testimony by other participants in the decision to sell arms to Iran.    Israeli officials have said that starting in 1985, they agreed to participate in arms sales to Iran with approval from the highest levels of the Reagan administration. Investigators have said one memo found in Lt. Col. North's files indicated that as early as 1985, some White House aides were considering the possibility of using profits from those transactions to help insurgents battling the Nicaraguan government. But that memo doesn't refer to the Israeli government, according to administration officials. </TEXT></DOC>
