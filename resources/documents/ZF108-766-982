 From their beginnings asinexpensive ways to share costly peripherals, LANs have evolved intosophisticated entities, allowing users to share files and printers andprocessing power.andP;  Hardly an industry exists that hasn't been touched bynetworks, and in some cases, such as the financial world, networks haveprovided such a competitive edge as to become indispensable.andM;About the same time LANs were beginning to infiltrate the informationprocessing world, networking philosophy was revolutionizing another industry.andO;The Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) protocol was developed sevenyears ago to allow musical instruments, as well as other related devices, toshare information about their performance and control.andP;  Since then, MIDI haschanged the face of the music industry, not simply guarding against the theobsolescence of expensive electronic equipment, but creating whole new formsof artistic expression.andP;  The development and acceptance of MIDI closelyparallels that of the earliest LANs.andP;  As with LANs, the user of MIDI canbuild systems of devices from multiple vendors, allowing them to shareresources and preserve their substantial investment in equipment.andP;  &quot;In thisbusiness, if an instrument is two or three years old, it's ancient,&quot; saysScott Wilkinson, editor-in-chief of Home and Studio Recording Magazine and anexecutive board member of the MIDI Manfuacturer's Association, theorganization that approves changes to the specification.andP;  &quot;MIDI was designedto forestall that obsolescence.&quot;andM;Unlike most general-purpose network protocols, MIDI is an uncompromisedspecification.andP;  Whereas most protocols are hashed out over months or evenyears of dispute and political maneuvering, MIDI is the soleinformation-sharing protocol of the music industry.andP;  MIDI is taken forgranted by every manufacturer of music equipment.andP;  Imagine if every PC,Macintosh, technical workstation, minicomputer, and mainframe manufacturerput Ethernet on the motherboard.andP;  With MIDI, there are no incompatibilitywoes because there is only one version of the protocol, and it hasn't changedin seven years.andM;However, while the MIDI specification has been standing still, musicians havenot.andP;  Just as LANs went from an unexpected convenience to a driving force inthe computing world, MIDI systems have become a creative necessity forperformers, who, in a few short years, have devised networks of instrumentsso complex and extensive that the protocol that made them possible is nolonger sufficient.andP;  MIDI has affected music-making and performance so muchthat it can no longer satisfy the demand it created.andM;Now, the music industry is on the brink of embracing a full-blown networktechnology to fulfill its creative needs.andP;  Straining against the limits of asimple, unidirectional network, performers are seeking ways to expand theircommunications capability without sacrificing the complete compatibilityguaranteed by the original MIDI specification.andP;  MediaLink, a new networkingprotocol, may provide the solution to the limits of MIDI, allowing users tofulfill creative needs without sacrificing expensive equipment.andM;How MIDI WorksandM;MIDI systems operate according to a master/slave relationship.andP;  A singlecontrolling device sends out information, usually musical, that is recognizedand echoed by other devices connected to the master device.andP;  Thus, twokeyboard synthesizers from different vendors with different sounds can playsimultaneously.andP;  This allows for a process called layering, which letsmusicians build sound that would not be available from a single instrument.andM;MIDI connects the instruments by cables plugged into one of three ports onthe MIDI device, labelled &quot;in,&quot; &quot;out&quot; and &quot;thru.&quot;andP;  The MIDI cable runs fromthe outbound port of the controlling device to the inbound port of thereceiving one.andP;  The receiving instrument is then fooled into thinking that itis being played by a human, and it responds by playing the same notes thatare being played simultaneously by the controlling instrument.andM;Instruments can also be daisy-chained.andP;  A MIDI serial cable can run from theout port of a controlling device to the in port of a receiving device, inwhich case the device will play the notes sent by the controller.andP;  If a cableis also connected to the thru port of the receiving device, the instrumentwill pass the information along to the next instrument in the chain.andP;  Usersalso have the option of turning an instrument's local control off, whichinternally disconnects the keyboard from the generating circuitry.andM;Networks common in the corporate world, like Ethernet and Token Ring, areinsufficient for musical demands.andP;  Their limited bandwidth constrains theiruse in real-time applications.andP;  As with transmitting voice over networks, thetiniest delay in transmission may sound like a deafening silence to even theuntrained human ear.andP;  Layering various instruments requires that the notes beplayed simultaneously to simulate true analog sound.andP;  MIDI, although simplewhen compared to distributed processing, is fast.andP;  A MIDI message takes onlyone millisecond to travel from a controlling instrument to a receivingdevice, a delay that is imperceptible to the human ear.andM;However, the delay can be propagated over a daisy-chained system ofinstruments.andP;  Past a certain point, the delay is perceptible to the human earand therefore is unacceptable.andP;  Users overcome this limitation with a MIDIthru box, which acts like a hub in a traditional LAN writing system.andP;  TheMIDI cable runs from the out port of a controlling instrument to the in portof the thru box.andP;  The thru box takes the MIDI information and splits it intoidentical data streams, all with the same one millisecond delay, and sendsthem to the MIDI in ports of all the receiving devices.andM;MIDI MessagingandM;MIDI devices communicate through a variety of highly specialized and definedmessages, similar to the data packets that pass information along LANs likeEthernet.andP;  There are two basic categories of MIDI messages: channel messagesand system messages.andM;MIDI channels are analogous to television channels.andP;  A receiving instrumentis like a TV: Although it receives all the channels being broadcast, it onlydisplays the channel the viewer selects.andP;  Similarly, MIDI devices receiveinformation on all channels, but only respond to the information coming overthe channel to which they are set.andM;The channels allow the musicians to set up different configurations ofdevices.andP;  By setting the controller to different channels, the musician canchoose which configuration to play.andP;  Channels are polyphonic and can usuallyplay up to 16 notes at a time.andP;  The notes on a single channel can also besplit between two instruments, in a process called zoning.andM;There are two types of channel messages: channel voice and channel mode.andO;Channel-voice messages include the basic note-on and note-off messages.andO;Beginning a note requires a three-byte note-on message.andP;  The first, orstatus, byte identifies it as a note-on message and designates the channel onwhich it's being sent.andP;  The second byte identifies the actual note, like Csharp, that is to be played.andP;  The final byte identifies the volume at whichthe note is to be played.andP;  The volume, or velocity, as it is called, isdetermined by how fast the key is being depressed.andP;  Note-off messages areidentical, with the status byte identifying the message as a note-off insteadof a note-on.andM;In addition to the note-on and note-off messages, there are channelaftertouch messages that allow the musician to affect expression.andP;  When achord is played on a keyboard, each key is struck simultaneously, but with adifferent pressure.andP;  MIDI devices average the pressure being applied to eachkey and send that information out as a single message.andP;  MIDI also allows forpolyphonic aftertouch messages, which inform slave devices of the pressurebrought to bear on each individual key.andP;  Despite the enhanced level ofexpression available with polyphonic aftertouch, there are few electronicinstruments that actually recognize and echo those messages, mainly becauseit's expensive.andM;Electronic instruments need to mimic acoustic instruments' functions.andO;Therefore, the MIDI specification incorporates messages to reflect musicalexpression.andP;  Most of the expression is communicated by control changemessages, which are three-byte messages.andP;  A status byte identifies it as acontrol-change message and specifies the channel.andP;  The second byte containsthe actual information, telling the device to add vibrato, hold a notelonger, or glide between notes.andP;  The third byte is the parameter amount forthat information, telling the device how far to alter it.andM;Channel-mode messages are actually a subset of control-change messages, butare conceptually set apart.andP;  Rather than musical information communicated bycontrol-change messages, channel-mode messages communicate information abouthow an instrument should respond to MIDI messages.andP;  It can tell an instrumentto respond only to a set channel, or all channels indiscriminately.andO;Channel-mode messages also let users reset all controllers to their defaultsettings, turn all notes on or off, turn local control of an instrument on oroff, or, in extreme situations, activate a panic button that reboots thesystem.andM;The three types of system messages include system common, system real time,and system exclusive.andP;  System common messages include song pointer messagestelling the device exactly where it is in a song.andP;  Song select messages tellthe device which song to play from a queued selection.andP;  This selectioninvolves a controlling device called a sequencer.andM;System common messages also include the now-obsolete tune request message,which was included to keep old instruments with analog electronics fromdrifting out of tune.andP;  A MIDI time code message accurately describes thepassage of time to a MIDI device.andP;  Finally, end-of-exclusive messages tellthe devices that the system exclusive messages have finished.andM;All one-byte system, real-time messages are concerned with the passage oftime and include a timing clock, start, continue, and stop messages, as wellas a system reset message and active sensing.andP;  The timing clock messages aresent 24 times per quarter-note and provide basic synchronization of devices.andO;Start messages tell a device to play a piece from the beginning, and continuemessages tell them to pick up where they left off.andP;  Stop and system reset, ofcourse, do exactly what their names imply.andM;The final system real-time message is active sensing.andP;  Not all MIDI devicesrecognize it, but it can be invaluable in live performance situations.andP;  Thechance always exists that onstage a MIDI cable could be kicked out by anoverly animated performer, after a message has been sent by one device, butbefore it is received by another.andP;  This leads to the second device stickingon one note.andP;  Active-sensing messages are sent three times a second.andP;  If adevice fails to receive one, it assumes that the cable has becomedisconnected and stops playing.andM;Finally, there are system exclusive messages, which are, as Wilkinson franklyputs it, &quot;a can of worms.&quot;andP;  Theoretically, all MIDI messages should beunderstood by all MIDI devices, but since each instrument is differentinternally, the designers of MIDI included ways for each manufacturer torepresent what was unique about the way their device sounded.andP;  With systemexclusive messages, which include each manufacturer's unique identificationnumber, devices can upload or download internal configuration information.andM;All this information isn't lost once it's played.andP;  MIDI information can bestored on file like any digital information.andP;  Furthermore, it can be editedand administered by sequencers, so called because they store a sequence ofMIDI messages.andP;  Sequencers not only record notes, but timing information aswell.andP;  Users can also edit the information stored in a sequencer, correctingor deleting missed notes or changing the tempo and pitch independently.andM;Hardware sequencers look like a tape recorder with a small LED display.andO;There are also software-only sequencers that run on personal computers,predominately Macintoshes and Atari STs, although they can run on IBM PCs andcompatibles as well.andP;  To run a sequencer on a PC requires that the machine beoutfitted with a MIDI interface, except for the Atari ST, which has one builtin.andM;Room for ImprovementandM;The MIDI standard has remained rigidly unchanging since it was developed, andon one hand that's a good thing.andP;  Users can retain instruments that wouldotherwise have become outdated, and they are assured of continuedcompatibility with all new products.andP;  Unfortunately, certain limitations makeMIDI incapable of containing or satisfying the creative energies ofmusicians.andM;The first of these is the 16-channel limit.andP;  Like the designers of DOS, whothought 640KB of memory would be plenty, the MIDI architects felt that 16channels would be more than enough, not anticipating users who wanted toincorporate more than 16 instruments into one system.andP;  As more instrumentsbecome more sophisticated and are capable of responding on several channelssimultaneously, a MIDI can quickly run out of channels.andM;The next obstacle is the 31.25Kbps bandwidth limitation.andP;  Although thebandwidth can support 400 to 500 notes per second and would probably besufficient if MIDI were only responsible for note-on and note-off messages,it's not practical for the way music is really played.andP;  &quot;Musically, that'snot very interesting,&quot; says Wilkinson.andP;  &quot;The challenge for MIDI is torepresent expression.&quot;andP;  The messages that tell devices at what volume to playa note, how long to hold it, what pitch to play it at, and so on, take up anenormous amount of bandwidth, not because of the size of the messages butbecause of the sheer quantity of messages needed to simulate analogcontinuity.andP;  With thick chords or several channels of controllers opening atonce, messages get stacked up for several milliseconds that can result inaudible time delays.andP;  &quot;It's expression that clogs up MIDI bandwidth,&quot; saysWilkinson.andM;Finally, MIDI messages only run one way; it is not a bidirectionalcommunications method.andP;  Devices have no way of knowing what other devices arereceiving information, if the messages are being received successfully, oreven what devices are on the system.andP;  Also, while a computer may have a MIDIinput port, it rarely has a MIDI output port as well.andP;  So when bidirectionalcommunications are necessary, as they are during the editing process,physical patching of cables is often in order.andM;Users can overcome these limitations, aside from the commonly used MIDI hubs.andO;In the past, attempts to develop computers that would provide multiple MIDIports were largely dependent on software and didn't really solve the largerproblem of expanding MIDI for all users.andM;In the networking world, standards are constantly being created and evolving.andO;To one entrenched in this environment, the obvious solution would be toupgrade the MIDI specification, but it seems that most of the music industryis firmly opposed to the idea.andP;  Changing the specification to accommodatelarger systems would automatically make instruments designed to the upgradedspecification incompatible with older ones.andP;  All the benefits of being ableto expand the current MIDI systems would be lost if thousands of dollarsworth of equipment suddenly became obsolete.andP;  For now, anyway, the currentspecification has to be maintained.andM;Doing It the LAN WayandM;One company, Lone Wolf, of Redondo Beach, Calif., has turned to LANs for thesolution.andP;  Mark Lacas and David Warman, founders of Lone Wolf, had originallylooked to traditional LANs such as Token Ring to solve MIDI's limitations butfound that neither Token Ring nor Ethernet could guarantee packet deliverywithin the time constraints of this real-time application.andP;  Out of theirfrustration came MediaLink, a LAN protocol that transports MIDI and otherdigital data over a high-speed, high-bandwidth bidirectional network, withoutsacrificing any compatibility with the MIDI standard.andM;The first available MediaLink product is the MidiTap, which acts like aprotocol translator.andP;  The MidiTap has four MIDI ports for connecting MIDIdevices and two MediaLink ports to connect to other MidiTaps.andP;  Each MidiTapconnects up to 64 devices, which can then communicate with devices connectedto other MidiTaps across a MediaLink LAN.andP;  Internally, MediaLink uses anencapsulation method to connect these devices.andP;  The MidiTap packages the MIDIinformation in its own transmission format and sends it across the cable.andO;The receiving MidiTap takes the MIDI information out of the proprietaryformat so it can be understood by the electronic instrument.andP;  This techniqueis used in Ethernet-to-FDDI and Token Ring-to-FDDI bridges today.andM;MediaLink lets devices on different nodes be configured in groups.andP;  Each LANmay have up to 64,000 groups of devices.andP;  Groups are analogous to channels,except on a larger scale.andP;  MediaLink addresses these user-defined groups, orLANscapes, through multicast messages, where two or more nodes communicatewith two or more groups simultaneously.andP;  Up to 128 LANscapes can be stored bythe MediaLink system at once.andM;The biggest problem is ensuring real-time operation, which MediaLink doesthrough its Set-Up and Performance modes.andP;  In Set-Up mode, the MediaLink LANis used to transfer data that does not have to be registered in real time.andO;This includes system-exclusive data and MIDI files, like those stored on asequencer.andP;  In Performance mode, MediaLink gives priority to certain types ofmessages and limits the size of the messages to ensure real-time operation.andO;MediaLink also specifies a fiber-optic backbone.andP;  Users can choose fromspeeds of 2Mbps, 20Mbps, 50Mbps, and 100Mbps.andM;Unlike MIDI, MediaLink is bidirectional, so devices acknowledge the messagesthey have received.andP;  If a device doesn't confirm that it has received amessage, the sending device knows to retransmit the message.andP;  If, after fourattempts the receiving device still doesn't acknowledge the signal, it isremoved from the network.andM;MediaLink provides network management features unavailable with MIDI.andP;  EachMidiTap port can be named by the device connected to it, so users don't haveto remember which port they connected an instrument to.andP;  They can just lookat an alphabetized list of devices on the MidiTap display itself.andP;  LANscapescan then be created by matching the desired source device names with thedestination devices.andM;MediaLink is a proprietary protocol, but is likely to become a de factostandard in the music industry.andP;  Lone Wolf will license the specification tothe industry, just as Olof Soderblom licensed Token Ring to the computerindustry.andP;  When it was first introduced, the MidiTap was not cheap at $2,500.andO;But Lone Wolf recently slashed prices, and now the MidiTap can be had for$1,595.andP;  Patch bays that connect MIDI devices cost more and do less.andP;  Also,if MediaLink skyrockets the way industry insiders expect it to, manufacturersmay start building MediaLink interfaces directly into their products.andM;The Multimedia LANandM;MediaLink has applications outside the industry it was created for.andP;  It canaccept not only MIDI devices, but SCSI devices as well.andP;  It accepts SMPTE(Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineer) information, which is thetiming code standard in the video and film industries for synchronizing soundwith visual images.andP;  In theory.andP;  MediaLink networks could control musicalinstruments, lighting systems, projectors, or any device that can communicateinformation over a MIDI or MediaLink interface.andP;  &quot;You could record dancemoves in a sequencer if you wanted,&quot; says Lacas.andM;While the immediate benefit of this multimedia network is in performancesituations where lighting and video systems could be controlled with themusic, eventually MediaLink may escape the music industry and become amultimedia solution for the rest of the world.andP;  MediaLink's real-timecapability is useful not only for musical performance data, but also forvideo teleconferencing, eliminating the problem of static images.andM;Instead of LANs centered in a box on a user's desktop, Lacas envisionsmultimedia networks that provide traditional communication functions inaddition to immersing the user in an environment they define and control.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
