L. 94-163, 89 Stat. 917, as amended by the National Energy ConservationPolicy Act (NECPA), Pub. L. 95-619, 92 Stat. 3266, the National ApplianceEnergy Conservation Act of 1987 (NAECA), Pub. L. 100-12, and the NationalAppliance Energy Conservation Amendments of 1988 (NAECA 1988), Pub. L.100-357, which requires DOE to prescribe standardized test procedures tomeasure the energy consumption of certain consumer products, includingrefrigerators and refrigerator-freezers. The intent of the test proceduresis to provide a comparable measure of energy consumption that will assistconsumers in making purchasing decisions. These test procedures appearat 10 CFR Part 430, Subpart B.DOE has amended the prescribed test procedures by adding 10 CFR 430.27on September 26, 1980, creating the waiver process. 45 FR 64108. DOE furtheramended the Department's appliance test procedure waiver process to allowthe Assistant Secretary for Conservation and Renewable Energy to grantan interim waiver from test procedure requirements to manufacturers thathave petitioned DOE for a waiver of such prescribed test procedures. 51FR 42823, November 26, 1986.The waiver process allows the Assistant Secretary for Conservation andRenewable Energy to waive temporarily test procedures for a particularbasic model when a petitioner shows that the basic model contains one ormore design characteristics which prevent testing according to the prescribedtest procedures or when the prescribed test procedures may evaluate thebasic model in a manner so unrepresentative of its true energy consumptionas to provide materially inaccurate comparative data. Waivers generallyremain in effect until final test procedure amendments become effective,resolving the problem that is the subject of a waiver.The interim waiver provisions, added by the 1986 amendment, allow the AssistantSecretary to grant an interim waiver when it is determined that the applicantwill experience economic hardship if the Application for Interim Waiveris denied, if it appears likely that the petition for waiver will be grantedand/or the Assistant Secretary determines that it would be desirable forpublic reasons to grant immediate relief pending a determination on thepetition for waiver.Amana's petition seeks a waiver from the DOE test provisions that requiresthe energy consumption of refrigerator-freezers be determined by AppendixA1 of Subpart B of 10 CFR Part 430. Amana states that the existing testprocedure does not adequately evaluate the true energy consumption of itsproduct because there is no provision in the existing test procedure todetermine the interval between defrost cycles for a refrigerator-freezerwith a variable defrost control. Amana believes that the existing testprocedure is likely to incorrectly estimate the energy consumption of thesemodels, thereby misleading the consumer. Since the current DOE test proceduresdo not address this control feature, Amana asks that the waiver be granted.Amana requests approval to perform testing to determine energy consumptionin accordance with the DOE proposed test procedure as published in the<T4>Federal Register</T4> on September 26, 1988. 53 FR 37416.In support of its position that the petition for waiver will likely begranted, Amana identified four current waivers which DOE has issued forsimilar control features.Three of the four were issued to Whirlpool Corporation (Whirlpool), CaseNo. FR-001, January 11, 1985. 50 FR 1628. Case Nos. RF-003 and FR-004,October 14, 1986. 51 FR 36591.The fourth waiver was issued to White Consolidated Industries, Case No.FR-002, on April 26, 1986. 51 FR 15679.In reviewing Amana's Application for Interim Waiver, the Department findsthat the company has not provided sufficient information for DOE to evaluatewhat, if any, economic impact or competitive disadvantage, Amana will likelyexperience absent a favorable determination on the Application for InterimWaiver.However, Amana has demonstrated through the granting by DOE of the fourprevious waivers and the Department's proposed rule published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on September 26, 1988 (53 FR 37416) the likelihoodof success of its petition for waiver.Therefore, the Department finds that it would be desirable for public policyreasons to grant Amana's Application for an Interim Waiver. Specifically,in those instances where the likely success of the petition for waiverhas been demonstrated based upon DOE having granted a waiver for similarproduct design, it is in the public interest to have similar products testedand rated for energy consumption on a comparable basis.Pursuant to paragraph (b) of 10 CFR 430.27, DOE is hereby publishing the``Petition for Waiver'' in its entirety. The petition contains no confidentialinformation. DOE solicits comments, data, and information regarding thepetition.In addition, pursuant to paragraph (e) of andSection; 430.27 of the Codeof Federal Regulations, the following letter granting the Application forInterim Waiver was issued to Amana Refrigeration, Incorporated.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC, December 1, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">John R.

Fitzpatrick, Assistant Secretary for Conservation andRenewable Energy, United States Department of Energy, Forrestal Building,1000 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20585 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">From: Amana Refrigeration, Inc., Amana, Iowa 52204 </ITAG>Amana Refrigeration, Inc. submits this Petition for Waiver pursuant tothe provisions of 10 CFR 430.27: 1. <T3>Petitioner.</T3> Amana Refrigeration, Inc. is a manufacturer of homeappliances including refrigerator-freezers and hereby petitions for a waiverfrom the test procedure specified in 10 CFR Part 430, Subpart B, AppendixA1. Concurrently with the filing of this Petition for Waiver, Amana Refrigeration,Inc. is filing an Application for Interim Waiver. 2. <T3>Identification of Model.</T3> Amana Refrigeration has developed andplans to market a basic twenty-five (25) cubic foot side-by-side refrigerator-freezermodel equipped with a through-the-door ice dispenser and an electronicvariable defrost control. At this time the basic refrigerator has threeversions identified as SXDE25, SLDE25, and SCDE25. The first two lettersin the prefix may change in the future but the control system will notbe affected. Suffix alpha or numeric designators may also be used to indicatemodel year or color/visual characteristics, but the ``DE25'' designationwill remain. The prefix and suffix changes will not indicate a change inthe control system. 3. <T3>Other Manufacturers. </T3>White Consolidated Industries and WhirlpoolCorporation are other manufacturers known to Amana to have models incorporatinga non-time initiated defrost system similar to the Amana design. Both ofthese companies have submitted Petitions for Waiver which have been addressedby the Department. 4. <T3>Electronic Variable Defrost Control Design Principles. </T3>The variabledefrost control employs a microcomputer utilizing an algorithm that initiatesdefrost cycles on a non-timed basis depending on (1) compressor run timeand (2) the length of the preceding defrost period. The actual intervalbetween defrost cycles with this control could range from eight (8) toseventy-two (72) compressor run time hours. Under normal operating conditions,the interval between defrost cycles ranges from eight (8) to sixteen (16)compressor run time hours. In a non-use vacation mode, the defrost cyclelenghtens to seventy-two (72) compressor run time hours. 5. <T3>Basis for Waiver.</T3> Without a waiver, this refrigerator-freezermust be tested under the provisions of 10 CFR Part 430, Subpart B, AppendixA1. That test does not adequately evaluate the true energy consumptionof this product. There is no provision in the test procedure 10 CFR, Part430, Subpart B, Appendix A1 to determine the interval between defrost cyclesfor a refrigerator-freezer with an electronic variable defrost controlas described above, which would be comparable to normal usage patterns.Under the conditions specified in the test procedures, it is likely theactual energy consumption of the Amana variable defrost system will beestimated incorrectly, and be misleading to consumers. This result wouldbe unfair to both consumers and to Amana. The consumer, when comparingoperating costs, might be led into purchasing a product based upon incorrectjudgments about energy consumption because the labeling information isnot representative of normal usage patterns. Amana, on the other hand,would be placed in the position of providing cost of operation informationfor the energy guide label which it believes is inaccurate. 6. <T3>Proposed and Alternative Test Procedures. </T3>Amana Refrigeration,Inc. has reviewed the test procedure modifications requested and adoptedby previous waivers (RF-001, RF-002, RF-003, and RF-004), as well as theNotice of Proposed Rulemaking, <T4>Federal Register</T4> Vol. 53, No. 186 p. 37416-37422, issued by theU.S. Department of Energy, regarding 10 CFR Part 430, Subpart B, AppendixA1. The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking prescribes test procedures for ratingrefrigerators with innovative features such as variable defrost control(VDC). Amana has investigated the formula calculations described in 5.2.1.3.of the Proposed Rule and finds that it substantially represents the functionof our refrigerator in actual consumer usage. Therefore, Amana Refrigeration,Inc. requests that the proposed calculation procedure described in amendedparagraph 5.2.1.3. of 10 CFR Part 430 Subpart B, Appendix A1, found in<T4>Federal Register </T4>Vol. 53, No. 186, p. 37416-37422, as corrected,be allowed for this model. This method will result in a CT=15 hours. 7.<T3> Further Information.</T3> If additional information is desired, pleasecontact Robert L.

This application is submitted concurrentlywith a Petition for Waiver pertaining to a 25 cubic foot refrigerator-freezerbasic model which may be designated as SCDE25, SXDE25 or SLDE25. This refrigerator-freezerhas an electronic variable defrost control system. 1. <T3>Likely Success of the Petition for Waiver. </T3>Amana Refrigerationbelieves that the Petition for Waiver will be successful in that the proposedtest procedure allows the model to be tested in a manner that will accuratelyrepresent consumer usage patterns and thereby arrive at data representativeof true energy consumption. This is consistent with public and the purposesof the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act of 1987. 2. <T3>Favorable Determination on the Application for Interim Waiver. </T3>Failureto reach a favorable determination on this Application for Interim Waiverwill discourage future development of innovative control systems intendedto address actual consumer usage patterns. Electronic variable defrostcontrol systems better respond to actual consumer use patterns than doconventional timed defrost systems, thereby resulting in lower energy consumption.A favorable determination on this application for Interim Waiver will serveto further the nation's energy conservation policy by encouraging othermanufacturers to provide more energy efficient appliances. 3. <T3>Competitive and Economic Considerations. </T3>Amana Refrigeration hasinvested heavily in both human and monetary resources to bring an innovativeproduct to the point of production. If Amana cannot accurately label andmarket this product, it stands to lose both its investment and a competitiveposition in the overall market for energy conserving refrigerator/freezerappliances. 4. <T3>Further Information. </T3>If additional information is required, pleasecontact Robert L.
