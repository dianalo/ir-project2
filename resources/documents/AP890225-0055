Nineteen years later, however, business executives are saying theRacketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) is oftenused against them in a fashion never intended by Congress. They wantit changed.   ``We are just interested in bringing some sense to this muchabused statute,'' says Washington attorney Jack Quinn, who ispushing for overhaul of RICO on behalf of State Farm Insurance Co.   Capitol Hill is watching carefully as a well-heeled businesscoalition prepares for a showdown with consumer groups over issue.   ``It may be that it's being used in some places in civil actionswhen maybe it shouldn't be,'' Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., said lastweek.   Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., told the same Senate subcommitteesession he knew of one brokerage firm facing a potentialmillion-dollar bill for duplicating documents to defend a RICO civilsuit filed by a disgruntled investor.   ``Everybody who loses money these days wants to sue the brokeragefirm,'' Bumpers said. ``I don't want to jeopardize this legitimatelaw enforcement tool, but that (case) is obviously outrageous.''   The dispute over the law itself, however, is not that simple.   Consumer advocates are sending out storm warnings. The billcontains special provisions for the scandal-ridden securities andcommodity industries.   The savings and loan industry, reeling from fraud andmismanagement, could also benefit from key provisions of the bill,which went into the hopper for the third time in as many years lastweek.   ``This legislation weakening RICO comes at the worst possibletime _ in the middle of an unprecedented corporate crime wave,''consumer advocate Ralph Nader says. ``This is no time for members ofCongress to be soft on corporate crime.''   Sponsored in the House by Rep. Frederick Boucher, D-Va., the billwould leave much praised criminal provisions of the law untouched.But it would make major changes in civil provisions that permitvictims of racketeering and other frauds to receive triple damagesif they win their lawsuits.   More than 2,500 civil lawsuits were filed in federal courtsnationwide under the RICO statute between Nov. 1, 1985, and lastJune 30. This explosion combined with concerns in the businesscommunity over just how far it might go has fueled the campaignsoften the measure's civil provisions.   ``Civil RICO is truly a statute run rampant,'' says Boucher. ``Itwas intended for use against persons involved in organized crime,but its actual use has been almost exclusively against the businesscommunity.''   ``In the past, plaintiffs have used the civil provisions of RICO,and its treble damage penalty, in ordinary contract and commerciallitigation _ circumstances far removed from the intent of Congressto strike at organized crime,'' says Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, oneof the Senate sponsors of legislation to change the law.   Under the bill, federal, state and local governments would stillbe able to collect triple damages in any case.   Consumers also would be able to collect triple damages,consisting of actual damages plus twice that amount in punitivedamages as well as court costs and attorneys fees. But here thereare exceptions.   Investors hurt by insider stock trading could collect tripledamages under the bill. But the scandal that has battered WallStreet's arbitrage and junk bond empires includes many allegedoffenses besides insider trading.   Investors filing RICO suits in these other cases would be able tocollect no more than actual damages under the bill.   The same would hold for those who suffered losses as a result offraud in the currently unfolding FBI investigation of the Chicagocommodity futures markets.   Those other than governments and ``consumers'' filing civil suitswould be able to collect no more than actual damages unless thedefendant had been convicted of a felony for the conducted allegedin the civil suit.   In any case, a second court proceeding would be needed todetermine the question of triple damages or some lesser amount ofpunitive damages.   ``The result,'' says Pamela Gilbert, director of consumerprograms for the Capitol Hill-based U.S. Public Interest ResearchGroup, ``will be few if any civil RICO suits.''   Moreover, consumer advocates wince at a provision of the billthat could open the door to denying punitive damages in hundreds ofRICO suits already pending.   And some in the legal community, such as Joseph W. Cuneo, generalcounsel of the National Association of Securities and Commercial LawAttorneys, are concerned about the retroactive provision.   ``For Congress to say, well, we made a mistake, and you have topay the price,'' is completely unfair.</TEXT></DOC>
