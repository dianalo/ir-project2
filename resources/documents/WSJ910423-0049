As previously reported, the three-year contract reachedSaturday covers about 5,000 workers at the U.S. unit ofBridgestone Corp. of Japan, and sets a pattern for anadditional 30,000 workers in the tire industry.</LP><TEXT>   The agreement boosts pensions to $30 a month for each yearworked from $23.50 and gives current retirees a $200 bonus.It maintains the cost of living provision in the expiredcontract and provides a COLA advance of 25 cents an hour. Thenew contract will raise the current hourly wages andbenefits, now at $27.59, by 18% over three years.   However, the agreement provides no increase in base payand will fund part of the pension increase with a temporaryreduction in COLA payments in the second and third years ofthe contract. It will also rely increasingly on healthmaintenance and preferred practitioner organizations to trimhealth costs. The union wouldn't say whether it had achievedits goal of retaining the 100% medical coverage option.   &quot;The jury's still out on this contract until we know thecosts of the job security provisions,&quot; said Scott Merlis, ananalyst with Morgan Stanley. But he added: &quot;This doesn'tappear to be an extravagant contract.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
