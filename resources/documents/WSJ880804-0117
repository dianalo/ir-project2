The company attributed the improvement to a rebound in the economy of the oil-dependent states where it operates, new cafeteria openings and a year-earlier charge for the closing of a cafeteria near Dallas.    The cafeteria restaurant company, which serves Cajun and Southern-style dishes, said it expects to show sales rose to more than $60 million in the quarter ended June 30, up from $55.7 million a year earlier. Net income was between $2.5 million and $3 million, or about 25 cents a share, the company said, compared with the year-before $584,000, or six cents a share. In the 1987 fourth quarter, the company reported a charge of about 10 cents a share for the cafeteria closing.    The company said customer counts began to show improvement in the second half in its Texas and Louisiana markets, where sales had declined the previous year due to the downturn in the oil-based economy of those states.    For the year, the company expects to report sales increased to more than $230 million from $217.5 million. The company will report a tax benefit of about $2 million, or 21 cents a share, for fiscal 1988, making net income about $13 million, or about $1.40 a share. The tax benefit was taken in the second quarter. In the previous year, net income totaled $9.1 million, or 97 cents a share. Fiscal 1988 operating income rose to about $11 million, or about $1.20 a share, the company said.    During the year, the company opened 10 new cafeterias and sold one, bringing the total number to 124. It also entered the California market during the year, opening two stores in the San Joaquin Valley. An additional 12 cafeterias are scheduled to be opened in fiscal 1989, Rod Garrison, senior executive vice president, said.    In addition, the company said it began serving breakfasts in six of its cafeterias in 1988, and will add breakfast lines in an additional 12 to 15 locations in 1989. </TEXT></DOC>
