Col. Oliver North and his secretary altered an April 11, 1985, memorandum in which he urged that President Reagan be briefed on details of private efforts to finance and arm the Contras.    According to administration officials and other sources, Col. North withdrew the memo and three others from a special registry of the National Security Council's intelligence documents last Nov. 21, the day the Justice Department launched an informal investigation into the White House's secret arms sales to Iran. The fired NSC aide then instructed his secretary, Fawn Hall, to delete the reference to briefing the president, to make changes in the other three memos, and to shred still other records, the sources said.    Col. North's attempt to delete the reference to the president suggests that the Marine officer was worried that his memo could prove damaging to Mr. Reagan. It has spurred investigators to look more closely into the president's role in aiding the Nicaraguan rebels.    It isn't known whether Mr. Reagan was ever briefed on the extensive private efforts to arm the Contras during the two-year period from late-1984 to late-1986 when Congress barred U.S. military aid to them. &quot;We have no indication from the documents or the information on the president's schedule that he ever received such a briefing&quot; a White House official said.    The official also said the White House doesn't have a version of the April memo that recommends a briefing for the president.    The president repeatedly has denied detailed knowledge of the secret arms network directed by Col. North, and former National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane has testified that he was unaware of Col. North's central role in the Contra-aid operation.    Moreover, the sources said, Col. North's original memo doesn't say Mr. Reagan directed the former aide to organize a private network to aid the Contras, nor does it explicitly disclose that Col. North was the hub of the operation.    But a source who has seen the original three-page, top-secret document, which Col. North wrote to Mr. McFarlane, said it left &quot;a clear, unambiguous impression&quot; that the former White House aide believed the president had directed him to make sure the Contras got help.    &quot;It was clearly Ollie's belief that the president wanted him to do what he was doing,&quot; the source said. &quot;The implication is that the president authorized it, and here was a progress report.&quot;    Ms. Hall recently has told friends that although she now realizes it was wrong to try to alter White House documents, she believes Col. North was aiding the Contras under orders from the president.    Ms. Hall is cooperating with investigators. She is scheduled to testify next week before the congressional committees investigating the Iran-Contra affair about her role in making the changes, and in shredding and removing other documents. The committees and independent counsel Lawrence Walsh have obtained both Col. North's original memos and the altered copies.    The original April 11 memo recommended that Mr. Reagan be briefed about Contra military operations and plans. Col. North urged that the president be told about such details as a $50,000 operation to sabotage an ammunition depot at Sandinista military headquarters in Managua, and a planned attack on the government's Soviet-made, MI-24 helicopter gunships.    The altered memo, however, never mentioned the president. Instead, it recommended only that &quot;the current donors be approached to provide $15-20M (million) additional.&quot; At the time, Saudi Arabia already had contributed $32 million to the Contras.    Administration officials and other sources familiar with the memos say Col. North and Ms. Hall did a poor job of altering them, apparently because they were rushed. Col. North withdrew the four memos from the NSC's &quot;System IV&quot; registry on the day Attorney General Edwin Meese and his aides launched the informal probe.    That same day Mr. Meese contacted Col. North's boss, former National Security Adviser Rear Adm. John Poindexter, and got approval to start reviewing NSC files. Investigators began looking through Col. North's office files the following day. It isn't known whether Col. North discussed altering or destroying documents with other officials before he acted.    The altered documents were never returned to the files. &quot;That got overtaken by events,&quot; said one administration official. Investigators found the altered memos and copies of the original, unaltered ones in Col. North's office, the sources said.    There were other indications that the documents were revised in haste. References to the use of false shipping certificates, which claimed that arms actually intended for the Contras were going to Guatemala, were deleted from a March 5, 1985, memo. But copies of the certificates were attached to the altered memo, sources said.    The Tower Commission quoted from two of the altered memos in its report last February, but didn't reveal that other versions of the memos existed. Declassified versions of two altered memos also have been released by the congressional panels.    Separately, Mr. Walsh made a last-minute, but apparently unsuccessful bid to persuade the congressional committees not to grant Col. North limited immunity from prosecution in exchange for his testimony. After a closed-door meeting with lawmakers, Mr. Walsh told reporters that he believed &quot;immunity was not deserved,&quot; and that other witnesses could provide lawmakers with the information they hope to obtain from Col. North.    But the committees are likely to agree, at the most, to only a temporary delay in granting the former aide immunity. Lawmakers consider Col. North's testimony crucial to wrapping up the hearings, and they previously agreed in principle to grant him limited immunity. &quot;We're obliged to get all the facts out,&quot; said Arthur Liman, chief counsel for the Senate panel. </TEXT></DOC>
