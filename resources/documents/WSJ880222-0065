Earlier this month, the SEC filed civil insider-trading charges against Mr. Yagoda, former top trader at securities firm Marcus Schloss andamp; Co. A complaint also was filed against the firm, which settled the charges without admitting or denying guilt.    Stanley S. Arkin, Mr. Yagoda's lawyer, said, &quot;We strongly oppose the motion and will submit our papers to the court in the near future. What the government seeks is inequitable.&quot;    In an affidavit, Assistant U.S. Attorney Carl Loewenson said there is &quot;an ongoing investigation into the wide-ranging criminal fraud in the federal regulated securities markets arising out of so-called Yuppie Five investigation.&quot;    Since 1986, the Schloss firm has been a focus of the government's investigation in the Yuppie Five case, in which the SEC's New York office broke up an insider-trading ring that included young lawyers and investment bankers.    The government, when considering criminal charges against a defendant, often seeks to suppress information that may come out in a civil-case deposition until it has a chance to finish its own interviewing of witnesses and information gathering.    Mr. Yagoda hasn't been criminally charged. </TEXT></DOC>
