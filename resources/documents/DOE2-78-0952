At themoment that is the world's largest magnetic field for superconductingmagnets. This magnet system is a rigid superconducting system consistingof a NbTi outer magnet generating the 11 T background field and severalNb/sub 3/Sn insert magnets which use multifilamentary Nb/sub 3/Sn conductorsin react and wind and wind and react technique. The test facility wasdesigned from the beginning to permit an exchange of the partial coils.Thus, 19.3 T is not the upper field of the magnet system since the innermost19.3 T coil was not optimized. A 20 T coil is under construction witha 30 mm clear bore.</TEXT></DOC>
