saw the introduction of fourimpressive new machines.andP;  Looming on the horizon is another new model and agraphics accelerator board that together will bring the Mac unabashedly intothe world of the workstation.andP;  And a new version of the Mac operating system-- one that promises dramatic enhancements in capability and convenience,even while maintaining a high level of compatibility with older hardware andsoftware -- will be in the hands of developers, then users, within months.andM;But the forecast also shows some ominous clouds gathering over the Mac scene.andO;Last month's Xerox lawsuit challenges the Mac's legitimacy and raises theprospect that the industry will be mired in look-and-feel litigation foryears.andP;  Reports of new viruses, both on the Mac and on other platforms, havegiven further proof that personal computer users remain vulnerable to thethreat of techno-terrorism.andP;  And last month's grimly worded statement fromApple acknowledging a sales slowdown not only sent the company's sharestumbling on Wall Street but also sapped the confidence of developers anddealers whose fortunes rest on Apple's.andM;Although part of the problem is a business downturn affecting the entireeconomy, Apple can do much to expand the market, reassure the community andgive the Mac new momentum (see Apple: Extending the Macintosh advantage, Page21).andM;But third-party developers, too, have a key role to play in keeping the Macon track in 1990.andP;  It is primarily up to them -- once Apple delivers betaversions of Sys-tem 7.0 -- to develop the applications that will turnInterapplication Communications, the Communications Toolbox and other newsystem capabilities from abstruse technical specifications into features thattruly are useful.andM;It is also primarily up to the third-party community to produce the softwarethat can bolster the Mac in markets where it lags, such as professional CADand corporate database applications, as well as in a reinvigorated low-endmarket.andP;  One of the challenges developers face is to preserve the virtuesthat made the Mac in the first place -- elegance, simplicity and consistency-- while adding new levels of power to their programs.andP;  That won't be easy,but it's critical if the Mac is to maintain its distinctive appeal in a seaof competing graphical interfaces.andM;Dealers, too, can help the Mac move successfully into the '90s by improvingthe quality of service they provide.andP;  Even if, as we expect, Apple at lastextends its warranties to an industry-standard year or more, it will still beup to the reseller channel to keep customers better informed about upgradesand glitch fixes and to offer the kind of extended training and support thatincreasingly complex Mac networks require.andM;The decade ahead.andP;  Beyond 1990, technological development will put computersof almost unimaginable power on our desktops, in our laptops and even in thepalms of our hands.andM;For end users that means that the stuff of today's promo videos and sciencefiction will become everyday reality.andP;  Down the road we may see machines thatcombine the functions of a whole roomful of today's electronic devices -- notonly the computer but also voice-and-picture phone, fax, television, videorecorder, scanner, color printer -- in a single box.andM;Complex multivendor networks -- not only LANs but also WANs, perhapseventually one big network linking all of us, just as the telephone systemdoes today -- will become the norm.andP;  Distributed processing and high-speedservers -- for files, data and heavy computational tasks -- will supplementthe power of desktop machines.andM;Software will be modular and easily configurable: Managers, consultants andeven end users will be easily able to construct and modify their ownapplication environments, linking a variety of specialized modules andscripting their operations.andP;  Intelligent programs will adapt themselves tothe user's habits and preferences, and electronic agents, anthropomorphic orotherwise, will stand ready to do our bidding.andM;For developers and dealers, all this means both vast opportunity and profoundchallenges.andP;  Installing and supporting such complex configurations willrequire resellers to develop new patterns of organization and staffing.andP;  Whathas until now been the principal channel of Mac distribution -- the retailstorefront, staffed too often by hastily trained sales clerks -- may soon beobsolete, at least for the business market.andM;Developers will also have to look for new approaches.andP;  Software has longlagged behind the available hardware, and vaporware and incompatibilities arealready the bane of the industry.andP;  As hardware moves to new levels ofcomplexity, these problems will only be compounded, and even the arrival ofnew object-oriented development tools will offer only partial solutions.andM;Distribution, too, will have to take new forms as users increasingly look forspecialized modules to integrate into their custom environments.andP;  Sitelicensing, subscription services and electronic distribution, with feesperhaps based on usage monitors built into programs, may make theshrink-wrapped package an anachronism.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
