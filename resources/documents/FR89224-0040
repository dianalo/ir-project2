The proposed sale is located 5 miles west of Grand Lake,CO. The proposed actions are activities associated with the implementationof the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests Plan, approved on May 4,1984. The agency invites written comments and suggestions on the proposedmanagement activities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments concerning the proposed action must be receivedby March 15, 1989 to receive timely consideration in the development ofthe draft EIS.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Submit written comments, suggestions and questions onthe proposed action to George Edwards, District Ranger, Sulphur RangerDistrict, P.O. Box 10, Granby, CO 80446.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The area under consideration for vegetationtreatment encompasses approximately 800 acres of National Forest lands.About one half of the proposed treatment acres are in a former RARE IIroadless area. This area was released for multiple use management in theColorado Wilderness Act of 1980. Since the release of this roadless areain 1980, two timber sales have occurred in the area_Supply Creek timbersale in 1981 and Bowen Bulch timber sale in 1988.The timber volume generated from the Hatchet Park sale will be around 6million board feet. A range of alternatives for vegetation treatment willbe considered. One of them will be the no action alternative. Other optionswill consider both commercial and noncommercial treatments to address ForestPlan objectives dealing with water production, wood fiber production, visualquality, and wildlife habitat improvement. The EIS will analyze the cumulativeeffects of past, current and projected activities for each of the alternatives.Comments from other Federal, State and local agencies, organizations andindividuals who may be interested in, or affected by the decisions havebeen and will continue to be solicited. Scoping has been initiated throughindividual contacts and meetings beginning in the summer of 1988. Severalissues have been identified: Concern about visual impacts from Rocky MountainNational Park, the impacts of winter logging on existing snowmobile usein the area, the need to improve elk habitat adjacent to the Park, roadmanagement, the need to manage vegetation to lessen the potential impactof the Mountain Pine Beetle on adjacent private lands, fuel hazard reductionby providing a local supply of firewood for personal use. Contacts havebeen initiated with Rocky Mountain National Park, the Colorado Forest Service,the Colorado Division of Wildlife, Grand County Commissioners, the ColoradoEnvironmental Coalition, the Colorado Mountain Club, Louisiana PacificCorporation, the Grand Lake Trail Groomers, and several individuals.Public comment and participation is welcomed throughout the process. Additionalscoping will occur after the publication of this notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. The draft EIS is expected to be filed with theEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) and available for public review inApril of 1989. At that time EPA will publish a notice of availability ofthe draft EIS in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.The comment period on the draft EIS will be 45 days from the date of EPA'snotice of availability in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. It is very important that those interested inthe management of the former Never Summer Inventoried Roadless Area participateat this time. To be most helpful, comments on the draft EIS should be asspecific as possible and may address the adequacy of the statement or themerits of the alternatives discussed. In addition, Federal court decisionshave established that reviewers of a draft EIS must structure their participationin the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful andalerts an agency to the reviewers' position and contentions, <T3>Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. </T3>v. <T3>NRDC, 435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978). </T3>Such decisions have also establishedthat environmental objections that could have been raised at the draftstage may be waived if not raised until after completion of the final EIS,<T3>Wisconsin Heritages, Inc. </T3>v. <T3>Harris, 490 F Supp. 1334, 1338 (E.D. Wis. 1980). </T3>The reason forthis requirement is to ensure that substantive comments and objectionsare made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfullyconsider them and respond to the final.After the end of the comment period on the draft EIS, the comments willbe analyzed and considered by the Forest Service in preparing the finalEIS. The final EIS is expected to be completed by June of 1989. In thefinal EIS, the Forest Service is required to respond to comments received(40 CFR 1503.4). The responsible official will consider the comments, responses,environmental consequences discussed in the EIS and applicable laws, regulations,and policies in making a decision regarding this proposal. The responsibleofficial, who is the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests Supervisor,will document the decision and reasons for the decisions in the Recordof Decision. That decision will be subject to appeal under standard agencyprocedures (36 CFR Part 217).<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: February 16, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Raymond O.
