The potential uses for macrocyclemolecules extend over a wide range of technologies from catalysis, energyconversion, molecular metals, molecular computing and neurosensors tophototherapy in cancer treatment. In each of these categories, macrocyclemolecules exhibit a wide range of physicochemical properties associatedwith their rich spectrum of available molecular orbitals. This paperconcentrates on spectroelectrochemical studies of metallo- and non-metallo-phthalocyanines,which have been involved in catalysis, and the polymeric forms of siliconphthalocyanines, involving stacked-ring structures. Spectroelectrochemicalin-situ techniques of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy and UV-visiblespectroscopy together with voltammetry have provided a great body ofdata of fundamental importance.</TEXT></DOC>
