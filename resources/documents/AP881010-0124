(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A judge on Monday ordered CBS Records to turnover the master tape of the rock group Judas Priest's ``StainedClass'' album so it can be examined for subliminal messages thatmay have prompted two teen-agers to enter into a suicide pact.   CBS ``has not been completely cooperating with discovery in thiscase,'' Washoe District Court Judge Jerry Whitehead said beforedelaying trial of a lawsuit against the group and giving thecompany 30 days to hand over the master tape.   CBS has told plaintiffs in the lawsuit it cannot find the24-track master tape for the 1978 album. The judge said the tapewould be a key piece of evidence in separating sounds among themusic and lyrics to determine whether any subliminal messages exist.   Without evidence of subliminal messages, Whitehead said the casewould not go to trial since music and lyrics are protected by theFirst Amendment right to free speech.   If subliminal messages are found within the ``Stained Class''album, Whitehead said the trial would concentrate on whether suchhidden communication deserves the same First Amendment protection.   ``The court did not believe that it was automatic that the FirstAmendment protects the right to subliminal speech,'' Whitehead said.   The case is the first of its kind to advance this far in anAmerican court.   Judas Priest members weren't present in the courtroom Monday.   In 1986, the families of Raymond Belknap and James Vance, bothof nearby Sparks, filed suit claiming the music, words andsubliminal messages in the album drove the two into a suicide pact.   After listening to ``Stained Class'' for six hours, drinkingalcohol and smoking marijuana, Belknap, 18, killed himself with ashotgun two days before Christmas 1985. Vance, then 19, shot andseriously injured himself with the same shotgun.   Reno attorney Suellen Fulstone, who represents the band members,said neither her clients nor CBS has possession of the master tapeand CBS used a two-track tape dub to record the album.   ``We have not been able to locate it,'' Ms. Fulstone saidoutside the courtroom. ``I don't know how we're going to complywith the court's order.''   Attorney Kenneth McKenna, representing Belknap's mother AunuetteRoberson of Reno, scoffed at that claim.   ``I have never believed that the master tape was unavailable,''he said, adding he has found some subliminal messages on the albumbut might discover more if the master tape were used. McKennarefused to reveal the content of the alleged subliminal messages heheard.</TEXT></DOC>
