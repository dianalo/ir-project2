Background</ITAG>IntroductionSection 507(a) of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977(SMCRA) provides that a permit application ``shall be accompanied by afee as determined by the regulatory authority [which] may be less thanbut shall not exceed the actual or anticipated cost of reviewing, administering,and enforcing such permit * * * '' and that ``[t]he regulatory authoritymay develop procedures so as to enable the cost of the fee to be paid overthe term of the permit.''The legislative history of section 507(a) indicates that Congress had originallythought to finance the entire cost of implementing the Act through permitfees, but that considerations of fairness and financial burdens on smalland medium size operators led to the allowance of a fee ``less than'' thesecosts, and for payment over the term of the permit. H.R. Rep. 94-1445,94th Cong., 2nd Sess., 5-7 (1976).OSMRE rules at 30 CFR 777.17 incorporate the requirements of SMCRA section507(a); the language of andSection;777.17 is similar to the SMCRA language.On February 22, 1985, OSMRE proposed a permit fee rule which would haverequired collection of application fees to cover the full cost to the Departmentof the Interior for processing permits to conduct surface coal mining andreclamation operations and coal exploration and for approving mine plansand all other OSMRE permit-related processing actions (50 FR 7522). Therule would have applied to applications for mining on Indian lands, inthe Federal program States, and on Federal lands in States not having State-Federalcooperative agreements. Action to develop a final regulation which wouldrequire operators to reimburse DOI for the cost of processing applicationswas curtailed by passage of House Joint Resolution 465, Further ContinuingAppropriation for FY 1986. The conference report for the FY 1986 appropriationsrequired that OSMRE study the issue further and report to the Congresson its findings. Partially in response to this requirement, cost accountingsystems were put in place in each OSMRE permitting unit to track costsassociated with processing permits. OSMRE collected cost accounting datathrough fiscal year 1986 and up to June 1987 and has analyzed that dataand reported its findings to interested Congressional parties. Copies ofthese data and analyses are available for review in the AdministrativeRecord.The Proposed Fee SystemOSMRE is proposing a revised fee schedule for OSMRE permitting actionsin Federal program States, on Federal lands where OSMRE issues a permit,and on Indian lands. It is based on actual cost accounting data collected.The fee system proposed in this rulemaking is a combination of a fixedfee plus a per-acre fee (for land included in the permit area) for permitapplications to conduct surface coal mining and reclamation operations,and an hourly rate for permit renewals, coal exploration permits and forthe transfer, assignment or sale of rights under an existing permit.The permit fee system is proposed under the authority of section 507(a)of SMCRA and section 9701 of Pub. L. 97-258, 96 Stat. 1051 (31 U.S.C. 9701),which prior to editorial revision and recodification was section 501 ofthe Independent Offices Appropriation Act (IOAA). Section 9701 of the IOAAauthorizes an agency to prescribe regulations establishing the charge fora service or a thing of value provided by the agency.Under section 9701 the charge shall be fair and based on the costs to thegovernment, the value of the thing or service to the recipient, the publicpolicy or interest served, and other relevant factors. Guidance to theFederal agencies for interpreting section 9701 is provided by Bureau ofthe Budget Circular No. A-25 of September 23, 1959, and by related judicialprecedent.The United States Supreme Court, in interpreting the IOAA, has held thatunder that statute an agency must base a fee for a service on its valueto an identifiable recipient. <T3>National Cable Television Assn. (NCTA), v. United States, </T3>415U.S. 336 (1974): <T3>Federal Power Comm'n v. New England Power Co.</T3> 415 U.S. 345 (1974).In a series of contemporaneous cases on this issue, the United States Courtof Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit specified the requirementsan agency must meet to justify a particular fee.<T3> National Cable Television v. Federal Communications Comm'n,</T3> 554F.2d 1094 (D.C. Cir. 1976): <T3>Electronics Industries Ass'n v. Federal Communications Comm'n,</T3>554 F.2d 1109 (D.C. Cir. 1976): <T3>National Ass'n of Broadcasters v. Federal Communications Comm'n,</T3>554 F.2d 1118 (D.C. Cir. 1976):<T3> Capital Cities Communications, Inc. v. Federal Communications Comm'n</T3>,554 F.2d 1135 (D.C. Cir. 1976).Summarizing its interpretation of the ``value to the recipient'' standardas laid down in <T3>NCTA</T3>, the D.C. Circuit in <T3>National Association of Broadcasters </T3>stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">Briefly, we have interpreted the ``value to the recipient'' standardto include a number of specific requirements. First, the Commission must<T3>justify</T3> the assessment of a fee by a clear statement of the particularservice or benefit which it is expected to reimburse. Second, it must calculatethe <T3>cost basis</T3> for each fee assessed. This involves (a) an allocationof the specific expenses which form the cost basis for the fee to the smallestpractical unit; (b) exclusion of any expenses incurred to serve an independentpublic interest: and (c) a public explanation of the specific expensesincluded in the cost basis for a particular fee, and an explanation ofthe criteria used to include or exclude particular items. Finally, theCommission must set a fee calculated to return this cost basis at a <T3>rate</T3> which reasonably reflects the cost of the services performedor the value conferred upon the payer. The fees may be imposed on beneficiariesof agency services who satisfy the criteria of <T3>NCTA</T3> and <T3>New England Power.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">554 F.2d at 1133 (emphasis in original; footnote omitted).</ITAG>The fee schedule for permit applications proposed in this notice is basedon an analysis of data collected through OSMRE's cost accounting system.Data accumulated on permit processing costs for permits issued by OSMREin Tennessee from October 1985 through June 1, 1987, were analyzed to determinethe variation in costs of processing a permit that could be explained byvariations in acreage to be included in the permit, number of administrativecompleteness reviews, and number of technical deficiency letters for eachpermit. Tennessee data were used because the OSMRE field office in Knoxvillehad the most experience in permit processing and therefore would be themost efficient permit processing unit in the agency. The Tennessee programhas been administered by OSMRE as the sole regulatory authority since October1, 1984. The dollar amounts proposed in this rule are the numbers shownby the analysis to best fit the available data and best explain total permittingcosts.These dollar amounts are:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L0,tp0,p0,8/9,g1,t1,i1,s25,9</C> <H1> </H1><H1> </H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Administrative completeness review<D>$250.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Technical review<D>1,350.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">  Plus per acre (of land included in the permit)<D>13.50</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Decision document<D>2,000.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Technical deficiency letter<D>690.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Total (assuming no deficiencies)<D>3,600.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">  Plus per acre<D>13.50</D></ITAG></ITAG>Permit renewals, permit revisions and transfers of ownership in existingpermits would be charged at a fixed hourly rate multiplied by the numberof hours spent on processing the action to renew or revise the permit ortransfer ownership. The variation in costs to OSMRE of processing theseactions is too great to allow a meaningful fixed fee to be established.Coal exploration permits would also be charged at an hourly rate becausethere is insufficient data or experience to make a meaningful estimateof a fixed fee. The proposed rate is $24 per hour, which is based on theaverage salary of permit review technical staff at OSMRE plus overhead(administrative, support and supervisory costs). No fees are proposed formining plan reviews because these are performed under the Mineral LeasingAct rather than under SMCRA.Mid-term permit reviews are viewed as being of primarily public benefitand therefore there would be no charge for these reviews. The mid-termpermit review conducted under 30 CFR 774.11 does not convey a direct benefitto the permit recipient, but rather serves to protect the public interestby assuring that the permit continues to reflect conditions at the minesite. However, if as a result of the review a permit revision is necessary,permit revision fees would be charged to the applicant.Fees would be charged to all applicants for surface coal mining operationsand coal exploration activities for which the operator is required to obtaina permit from OSMRE. The proposed permit fees would be charged in the Federalprogram States, on Indian lands, and on Federal lands where OSMRE issuesa permit. In States with cooperative agreements where the State issuesa permit on Federal lands, the applicant would be required to pay the Statepermit fee to the State.Fees would not be charged retroactively. An effective date would be establishedat the time of publication of the final rule; all permit processing orissuing actions begun on or after the effective date of the final rulewould be charged permit fees.The proposed permit fees would not contain a special fee for small operators.The proposed permit fee schedule includes a per-acre charge for permitapplication fees which would tend to minimize the fees paid by small operationsrelative to large operations.Previously Proposed RuleOn February 22, 1985, OSMRE published a proposed rule to implement an actualcost accounting permit fees system (50 FR 7522). The proposed rule wouldhave required recipients of OSMRE's permit services to reimburse OSMREfor the actual costs incurred by the Department of the Interior in providingthe services.Numerous comments were received on the proposed rule. Most of the commenterswere opposed to one or more aspects of the proposed permit fee system.Most of the commenters from the coal industry objected to the proposedrule for the following reasons: (1) The permit fee would be an unknownexpense and therefore an operator would not know ``up front'' the costof doing business; (2) an actual cost accounting fee would not providean incentive to OSMRE employees to provide efficient permitting services;(3) a proposed permit fee system should recognize that the public is abeneficiary of OSMRE's service and should therefore share in the cost ofthese services; (4) permit fees would be prohibitively high for some operatorsunder the proposed system; and (5) some operators would be at a competitivedisadvantage under the proposed system if their proposed operations requiredextensive National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) compliance, or otherspecial circumstances required extensive OSMRE review.Most of the comments received from the State representatives reflecteda concern that States would be required to adopt a similar cost accountingpermit fee system and that Federal grants to the States would be reducedaccordingly to offset any fees collected.Comments from an environmental group indicated concern that actual costaccounting permit fees would: Bring pressure on the regulatory authorityto ``cut corners'' on permit review in order to keep costs down; undercutthe States' desire to obtain and retain primacy; be difficult to collectif allowed to be paid over the life of the permit.OSMRE has considered these comments in developing this revised proposedpermit fee system. OSMRE has also had the opportunity to gather and analyzeactual cost accounting data and to consider this data along with thesecomments. The resulting proposed rule should allay many of the commenters'concerns.The proposed fee system would enable a permit applicant to determine ``upfront'' the cost of a permit to mine. The proposed system recognizes thatpermit applicants and the public benefit from regulation of surface coalmining and reclamation activities under SMCRA and that the costs of theprogram should thus be shared. The proposed fee schedule is not prohibitiveeven for small operators and recognizes the differences in cost for permittingsmall mines and larger mines by assessing a per-acre fee. States wouldnot be required to adopt similar systems, nor is OSMRE considering phasingout State grants to encourage that similar systems be adopted; therefore,States are not discouraged from retaining primacy. Collection of permitfees should not present problems since most of the fees under this proposedsystem would be collected before permit processing began.Comments were also received strongly objecting to OSMRE's proposal to requirethe operator to reimburse OSMRE for inspection services. Industry feltthat the public was the sole beneficiary of these services and thereforeshould pay the costs. The environmental group felt that if the proposalwere adopted, inspectors would be under pressure to do a quicker and lessthorough inspection in order to keep costs down.OSMRE is proposing not to include the cost of inspections in the proposedpermit fee system. As stated in the February 22, 1985 proposed rule, notcharging for such activities would ensure that the frequency and intensityof inspection and enforcement practices fully reflect OSMRE's firm commitmentto the goals of SMCRA, and that inspectors are not inhibited from fullperformance of their duties by a concern for the costs that might be imposedon surface mining operators resulting from inspection and enforcement activities.Also, while inspection and enforcement may bestow some benefit on operatorsby encouraging lawful continuation of responsible mining and thereby improvingpublic relations, these activities protect the health and safety of thepublic and help preserve environmental and other resources, thereby benefitingthe public at large.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Discussion of Proposed Rule</ITAG>A. Basis of Fees for a New Permit<ITAG tagnum="81">Justification</ITAG>The proposed fee schedule for new permits is based on data collected byOSMRE under an actual cost accounting system for all permits issued inTennessee from October 1985 to June 1987. The data were analyzed to determinethe equation that would best fit the available data and best explain thevariation in costs of permit processing on individual mines.Data were broken down to show the costs of each step of a permit reviewincluding the administrative completeness review, the technical review,and the preparation of a decision document for each permit. Data were alsocollected which showed the number of administrative completeness reviewsthat were necessary for each permit, the number of technical deficiencyletters necessary to obtain additional technical information needed toprocess each permit, and the number of acres covered under each permit.Regression analyses were run on the available data using the total permitcosts as the dependent, or ``y'' variable, with various combinations ofindependent, or ``x'' variables. The analysis which gave the best resultsused a combination of three independent variables: number of acres, numberof administrative completeness reviews, and number of technical deficiencyletters.The fees that appear in this proposed fee schedule are based on this regressionanalysis and also consider the breakdown of costs for each step of thepermit review. Overhead costs for support and supervisory personnel andadministrative costs are included in the proposed fees.The proposed permit fee system would be similar to fee systems used byother Federal agencies in that it would employ a fixed fee schedule basedon historical costs, and applicants would pre-pay for services. The proposalis consistent with draft guidelines for user charges published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> by the Administrative Conference of the UnitedStates on March 12, 1987 (52 FR 7812).The proposed schedule for new permit applications would be similar to permitfee systems in other States with primacy in that it would include a per-acrecomponent and a fixed per-permit fee. The per-acre charge allows the costsof permit processing to vary directly by size of operation; it also reflectsthe general trend in variation of OSMRE's permit processing costs.The proposed fee system would encourage operators to submit complete andaccurate permit applications since applicants would be charged additionalfees for additional administrative completeness reviews or for technicaldeficiency letters necessary, and since prepayment of fees is required.The proposed permit fee schedule is designed to recover the full coststo OSMRE to process a permit application. It is not intended to recoverthe costs to OSMRE to enforce the permit or to fulfill OSMRE's NationalEnvironmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) responsibilities.<ITAG tagnum="81">NEPA Compliance</ITAG>The proposed permit fee schedule is based on OSMRE's costs to process andissue a permit but does not include costs incurred in fulfilling NEPA obligations.In <T3>Nevada Power Co. v. Watt,</T3> 711 F.2d 913 (10th Cir. 1983), the courtmade it clear that the Department of the Interior could charge for environmentalimpact statement (EIS) costs, because they ``are a necessary prerequisiteto the receipt by the applicant of a special benefit, the grant of a right-of-way.''The court said that Interior is not constrained from charging the fullcost of the EIS to the applicant.However, OSMRE believes that NEPA analysis necessary for obtaining a surfacecoal mining operation permit should not necessarily be charged to the applicant.NEPA compliance costs vary widely from permit to permit and therefore uniformdistribution over all permits would not reflect OSMRE's costs to processeach permit as required by IOAA. On the other hand, charging an individualpermit applicant for preparation of an environmental impact statement forhis/her permit may affect the competitive balance, since NEPA compliancecosts on some permits are very high while on others they are inconsequential.<ITAG tagnum="81">Inspection and Enforcement </ITAG>The proposed permit fee schedule would not recover OSMRE's costs for inspectionand enforcement activities. Section 507(a) of SMCRA authorizes OSMRE tocollect a permit application fee which ``may reflect the cost of * * *enforcing'' the permit; that is, the cost for OSMRE to inspect the permitsite and enforce the permit requirements. The Secretary believes that theprimary benefits of inspection and enforcement activities accrue to thepublic and that the public stands to gain by OSMRE's not charging the operatorfor the service. Not charging for inspection and enforcement activitieswould ensure that OSMRE is not inhibited in its inspection and enforcementduties by the desire to keep expenditures within the bounds of whateverfees might be charged. OSMRE inspectors should have in mind the purposeof upholding the intent of SMCRA rather than concern for the costs of inspectionand enforcement activities. B. Fee for Permit Renewal or Revision; Transfer, Sale or Assignment ofRights; and Coal Exploration Permits Fees for permit renewal or revision, for the transfer, sale or assignmentof rights under an existing permit, and for coal exploration permits, wouldbe charged at an hourly rate for the actual hours spent by OSMRE reviewersin processing the application. Fees would be charged whether the applicationis approved, denied or withdrawn.Hourly rates are proposed for these actions due to the great variationin their processing cost and/or insufficient data to validate a fixed fee.As OSMRE gains more experience in these actions a fixed fee for them maybecome viable. Fees would not be charged for informal conferences or public hearings heldas a result of these actions. These conferences and hearings are beyondthe control of the operator and could be very costly. Charging for theconferences and hearings would be unfair since not all actions would resultin a conference or hearing. No fees would be charged for a notice of coal exploration where a coalexploration permit is not required. No fees would be charged for mid-termpermit reviews, since this action is mainly performed for the benefit ofthe public; however, any necessary permit revision identified as a resultof the mid-term review would require permit revision fees in accordancewith the fee schedule. C. Who Will Be Charged FeesFees as proposed in this rule would be charged in States where OSMRE isthe regulatory authority, on Federal lands where OSMRE issues a permitand on Indian lands. In States with State-Federal Cooperative Agreementsunder 30 CFR Part 745 where the State issues a permit on Federal lands,the applicant would be required to pay the State permit fee to the State.Where OSMRE issues a permit on Federal lands, permit fees would be chargedin accordance with the OSMRE permit fee schedule. Under this proposed rule,permit fees would not be charged for OSMRE actions on mining plans. Fees would be charged for permit processing and issuing actions begun onor after the effective date of the final rule. Although the fees wouldnot be charged retroactively, any permit application which was currentlyin process would be assessed a fee for any action begun after the effectivedate of the rule. For example, if a permit application were in the administrativecompleteness review stage when the rule became effective, a technical reviewfee plus per-acre fee would be collected before the technical review stageof the permit processing would begin. An effective date will be establishedat the time of publication of the final rule. <ITAG tagnum="81">Federal Enforcement of a State Program </ITAG>Where OSMRE institutes action under 30 CFR Part 733 and subsequently becomesthe regulatory authority for permitting activities in a State with an approvedregulatory program, permit fees as established in that State program wouldbe paid to OSMRE. In States where a Federal program is substituted foran existing State program under 30 CFR Part 733, where the State withdrawsits program or OSMRE withdraws approval of the program, OSMRE would chargepermit fees according to this proposed fee system but would deduct an amountequal to fees the permit applicant had already paid to the State for thepermitting action. If a State regains primacy following OSMRE enforcementof the State or Federal program in that State, OSMRE would not refund permitfees. Upon substituting Federal enforcement for the permitting portion of a Stateprogram, or implementing a Federal program in a State, OSMRE may reviewexisting pemits for compliance with SMCRA. Since the need for this reviewis not caused by negligence on the part of the permit holder but ratherresults from a deficiency in administration of a program, fees would notbe charged for this permit review. However, if this review resulted ina permit revision, fees would be charged for review of the permit revision.D. Small Operators The legislative history of SMCRA indicates that Congress had in mind smalland medium size operators when it allowed in SMCRA section 507(a) for apermit fee less than the actual cost to review, administer and enforcethe permit, and for payment of the fee over the term of the permit. Theproposed permit fee, while reflecting OSMRE's actual cost accounting data,would result in lower fees for small and medium size operators relativeto large operators, due to the per-acre fee that is part of the fee system.OSMRE is proposing not to allow for payment of the permit fee over theterm of the permit because the fees that are proposed should not be prohibitiveeven for small operators, and the administration of a deferred paymentsystem would be costly to OSMRE and could result in imposition of higherfees to compensate for the added costs.E. Section by Section Analysis <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 736_FEDERAL PROGRAM FOR A STATE </ITAG><T3>Section 736.25 Permit Fees. </T3>Section 736.25 would establish thefees to be paid for permits for surface coal mining and reclamation operationsand permits for coal exploration in States with Federal programs. It wouldalso establish fees to obtain processing of a permit revision or renewal,or the transfer, sale or assignment of rights under an existing permit,for permit holders in Federal program States. Currently there are Federalprograms for Georgia, Idaho, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, Oregon,Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, and Washington. A Federal programalso has been proposed for California (52 FR 39594, October 22, 1987).<T3>Section 736.25(a) Applicability. </T3>Paragraph (a) would state thatany person who submits to OSMRE an application for a permit to conductsurface coal mining and reclamation operations or coal exploration, orfor a permit renewal or revision, or the transfer, assignment or sale ofrights in an existing permit, shall submit fees as provided in the section.<T3>Section 736.25(b) New Permit and Repermit Applications. </T3>Paragraph(b) would provide that fees for a new permit to conduct surface coal miningand reclamation operations would be charged according to the requirementsof the schedule listed in paragraph (f) of the section, and the other requirementsof the section that follow.Paragraph (b)(1)(i) would require that applications for a permit to conductsurface coal mining and reclamation operations in States with Federal programsshall be accompanied by the administrative completeness review fee. Thefees would be the amount listed for administrative completeness reviewin paragraph (f). Paragraph (b)(1)(ii) would provide that, if OSMRE's reviewfor administrative completeness of a permit determines that additionalinformation is needed and requests that the applicant submit the additionalinformation, the applicant must submit an additional administrative completenessreview fee along with the required information. OSMRE would identify alladditional information necessary in the initial letter. If additional lettersare needed because the applicant fails to respond adequately to the initialletter, the applicant would be require to pay $250 for each additionalletter necessary. If an additional letter is needed due to an oversighton OSMRE's part, the applicant would not have to pay an additional fee.Paragraph (b)(2) would contain requirements for fees for a technical reviewof the permit application. Paragraph (b)(2)(i) would provide that whenthe applicant receives notice from OSMRE that the permit application isadministratively complete, the applicant must submit the technical reviewfee and per-acre fees as listed in paragraph (f) to move the applicationto the next step of review. Per-acre fees must be submitted for each acreor fraction thereof of land included in the permit area. Technical reviewof the permit would begin upon receipt of these fees by OSMRE. Paragraph(b)(2)(ii) would require that, if OSMRE notifies the permit applicant oftechnical deficiencies in the permit and requests additional information,the applicant would be required to pay a technical deficiency fee whenthe additional information is submitted. OSMRE would cease technical reviewon the permit while awaiting the required information and would resumereview of the application upon receipt of the fee and information. OSMREwould identify all technical deficiencies in the initial technical deficiencyletter. If additional technical deficiencies are noted that could havebeen included in the original letter and consequently an additional letteris sent, no charge would be made for the additional letter. However, if the applicant fails to respond adequately to the request foradditional information contained in the first technical deficiency letterand additional letters are necessary to repeat a request or a portion ofa request, the applicant would be charged the technical deficiency feefor additional letters necessary. Further, if the response to a technicaldeficiency letter raises new issues that require an additional technicalletter, the applicant would be charged an additional technical review fee.Paragraph (b)(3) would provide for payment of the decision document fee.To obtain a permit, the applicant would be required to submit a decisiondocument fee upon being notified by OSMRE that the permit application istechnically adequate. When the fee is received by OSMRE, preparation ofthe decision document would begin. <T3>Section 736.25(c) Permit Renewals and Revisions, Transfer, Assignmentor Sale of Rights, Coal Exploration Permits. </T3>Under proposed 30 CFR736.25(c)(1) fees for processing applications for a permit renewal or revision,for the transfer, assignment or sale of rights in an existing permit, orfor coal exploration permits would be charged to the applicant at the hourlyrate established in paragraph (f). Fees would be calculated by multiplyingthe hourly rate by the number of hours of actual time expended by OSMREstaff to review and process the application. Time spent by support staffin support activities and by supervisors in a supervisory capacity wouldnot be added to the fee because the hourly rate includes a factor whichtakes into account support and supervisory costs and other overhead. Timespent in conducting informal conferences such as those provided for permitrenewals and significant permit revisions in 30 CFR Part 744, and in providingfor public hearings for coal exploration permits in 30 CFR Part 772, wouldnot be included in the calculation of time expended. Paragraph (c)(2) would provide that fees due under paragraph (c) shallbe paid within 30 days of receipt of a bill from OSMRE even if approvalis denied or the application is withdrawn. Approval of the permit renewalor revision application, the transfer, assignment or sale of rights inan existing permit, or the permit to conduct coal exploration, would beissued upon receipt of the fees. Under proposed andSection; 736.25(c)(3), if the fees are not paid within30 days they would be considered delinquent and would be subject to interestat the rate established quarterly by the U.S. Department of the Treasuryfor use in applying late charges on late payments to the Federal Government,pursuant to Treasury Financial Manual 6-8020.20. The Treasury current valueof funds rate is published by the Fiscal Service in the notices sectionof the <T4>Federal Register. </T4>Interest on unpaid fees would run from the 31stday after the bill from OSMRE is received until the date of payment. Failureto pay overdue fees may result in one of more of the actions specifiedin 30 CFR 870.15 (e)(1) through (e)(5). Delinquent fees may be subjectto late payment penalties specified in 30 CFR 870.15(f) and processingand handling charges specified in 30 CFR 870.15(g).Concerning hourly fees paid for services under this paragraph, OSMRE issoliciting comment on the possibility of pre-collecting these fees also.OSMRE could estimate the costs beforehand and collect the estimated costfrom the applicant before the action is processed. Excess money would berefunded to the applicant; if additional funds were found to be necessary,further processing would cease until OSMRE collected an additional estimatedamount. This would eliminate the problem of delinquent fees and of tryingto collect fees for time spent processing applications that are later deniedor withdrawn by the applicant. <T3>Section 736.25 (d), (e).</T3> Section 736.25(d) would state that allfees are non-refundable. Section 736.25(e) would require that all feesbe submitted in the form of a certified check, bank draft, or money order.<T3>Section 736.25(f) Fee Schedule.</T3> Section 736.25(f) would establishthe fee schedule to apply to andSection;736.25.The administrative completeness review would be $250 for the initial reviewand for any subsequent reviews necessary because of insufficient informationin the permit application.The fee for the technical review would be $1,350.00 plus $13.50 per acreor fraction thereof of land to be included in the permit area.The fee for technical deficiency letters would be $690, for each technicaldeficiency letter necessary to obtain the required permit application information.The decision document fee is proposed at $2,000.00. This fee would coverthe costs of OSMRE's preparation of all documentation necessary to preparethe permit for issuance.Hourly fees would be $24.00 per hour. When hourly fees are charged, feeswould be prorated for charges for less than a full hour.<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 740_FEDERAL LANDS</ITAG><T3>Section 750.25 Permit Fees. </T3>Section 750.25 would establish therequired permit fees to be paid for permits for surface coal mining andreclamation operations and for coal exploration on Federal lands whereOSMRE issues a permit. It would also establish required fees for processingof a permit revision or renewal, or for the transfer, sale or assignmentof rights in an existing permit, where OSMRE was required to process theseactions. These fees would not apply in States with State-Federal CooperativeAgreements where OSMRE does not issue a permit.The rules in this section would parallel the rules in proposed andSection;736.25and therefore the preamble explanation for those proposed rules would applyto this section also.<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 750_INDIAN LANDS</ITAG><T3>Section 750.25 Permit Fees. </T3>Section 750.25 would establish therequired permit fees to be paid for permits for surface coal mining andreclamation operations on Indian lands. OSMRE is the regulatory authorityon Indian lands for surface coal mining and reclamation operations. TheBureau of Land Management has primary responsibility for coal explorationactivities involving Indian coal. Proposed andSection;750.25 would also establishrequired fees for processing of a permit revision or renewal, or for thetransfer, sale or assignment of rights in an existing permit.The rules in this section would parallel the rules in proposed andSection;736.25and therefore the preamble explanation for those proposed rules would applyto this section also, except that permits for coal exploration are notissued by OSMRE on Indian lands; therefore the coal exploration permitfee is omitted.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Procedural Matters</ITAG>Effect in Federal Program StatesProposed 30 CFR 736.25 would apply in those States with Federal programs.These include Georgia, Idaho, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina,Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, and Washington. The Federalprograms for these States appear at 30 CFR Parts 910, 912, 921, 922, 933,937, 939, 941, 942, and 947, respectively. Comments are specifically solicitedas to whether unique conditions exist in any of these States which shouldbe reflected as specific amendments to any or all of the Federal programs.OSMRE has issued a proposal to implement a Federal program for the Stateof California (52 FR 39594, October 22, 1987). Comments are also specificallysolicited as to whether conditions exist in California that should be reflectedin the proposed Federal program for that State.Paperwork Reduction ActThis rule does not contain information collection requirements which requireapproval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3507.Executive Order 12291 and Regulatory Flexibility ActThe U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) has determined that this proposedrule is not a major rule under the criteria of Executive Order 12291 (February17, 1981) and certifies that it would not have a significant economic effecton a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory FlexibilityAct, 5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3> Out of the nearly 7,000 active mining operations in the United States,the majority (over 95%) are governed by State programs, and not affectedby the rule. Most of the operations in the minority potentially affectedby the proposed rule already have surface mining and reclamation permits,so for this minority of operations the rule would apply only to the typicallyless costly renewal of, revision of, or transfer, assignment or sale ofrights in existing permits. Since permit renewal is required only at fiveyear intervals, the potential number of renewal applications in a givenyear is only one-fifth of the total number of permits outstanding. Addingto these the permits for new operations and for coal exploration for theanticipated number of applications processed annually by OSMRE the anticipatedfees are expected to fall below the criteria established by the ExecutiveOrder. Against this background of limited activity, the Department has concludedthat the proposed rule would not have an annual effect on the economy of$100 million or more, or result in a substantial increase in costs or pricesfor the Federal government, consumers, individual industries, State orlocal government agencies, or geographic regions. National Environmental Policy ActOSMRE has prepared a draft environmental assessment (EA), and has madean interim finding that the proposed rule would not significantly affectthe quality of the human environment under section 102(2)(C) of the NationalEnvironmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C). It is anticipatedthat a finding of no significant impact (FONSI) will be approved for thefinal rule in accordance with OSMRE procedures under NEPA. The EA is onfile in the OSMRE Administrative Record at the address specified previously(see ``<T2>ADDRESSES''</T2>). An EA will be completed on the final rule and afinding will be made on the significance of any resulting impacts priorto promulgation of the final rule.
