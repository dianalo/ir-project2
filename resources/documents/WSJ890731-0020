In cross-trading, market participants buy and sell foreign currencies against each other using the dollar as an intermediary vehicle. With the dollar's near-term direction seen as unclear, foreign currencies have been stealing the spotlight.    The pound-mark relationship is seen as particularly important because the British currency's fortunes have changed considerably in recent weeks.    In mid-July, the pound dropped to a 16-month low of about 3.01 marks amid perceptions of a monetary policy squabble between Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson and concerns about Britain's economy and labor unrest.    After coming close to falling below crucial support at 3.00 marks, the pound reversed direction and worked its way above solid resistance at 3.10 marks last week. Late Friday in New York, the pound traded at 3.1053 marks.    The currency's climb above the 3.10 mark level &quot;has caused the technicians to forecast numbers as high as 3.12 and 3.14,&quot; says Mr. Hatcher of near-term prospects.    Much of the turnaround is related to developments that have &quot;helped the interest rate outlook&quot; for the pound, says Nigel Rendell, international economist at James Capel andamp; Co. in London.    With the Deutsche Bundesbank considered unlikely to tighten monetary policy again soon and the Federal Reserve easing its credit grip, the pound is benefiting from the relatively high British rates that were largely overlooked during the recent slump.    Mr. Rendell says the British rate picture is also brightened by what he sees as a &quot;30%&quot; possibility that Britain's base lending rates will soon be increased to 15% from the current 14%, a four-year high.    High rates are generally favorable for a currency because they make investments denominated in the unit more attractive.    The pound has also been helped by reduced worries about Britain's merchandise trade deficit, which was an unexpectedly narrow #1.89 billion (about US$3.12 billion) in June, rather than the #2 billion deficit expected by many market participants.    But despite the bullish sentiment, many analysts say the pound probably won't get far beyond 3.15 marks.    &quot;I don't think we're completely out of the woods yet,&quot; says Mr. Rendell. He sees the pound falling to 2.95 marks in the next year, burdened by trade deficit concerns and what will probably be slow progress against U.K. inflation, which currently runs about 8%.    Also, Mr. Hatcher of Barclays Bank says concerns about the Thatcher and Lawson relationship &quot;could resurface very, very easily&quot; and hurt the pound.    Meanwhile, the yen is seen continuing its rebound against the mark now that Japan's political woes are no longer the primary force driving trading in that currency.    The mark traded at 74.15 yen late Friday in New York, having retreated after breaking through brick-wall resistance at 75.00 yen early last week.    The mark has the potential to fall toward 72.50 yen in coming weeks, says Frank Pusateri, senior corporate trader at the Bank of Boston. He notes that the yen is &quot;fundamentally strong&quot; because of Japan's robust economy despite the political uncertainty engulfing that nation.    Japan's governing party plans to choose a successor for resigning Prime Minister Sosuke Uno on Aug. 8 in a vote by Liberal Democrats in parliament.    While the yen has recovered, traders say the currency, like the pound, could eventually be undermined by persistent bearish sentiment.    &quot;I don't see anyone anxious to really run into the yen in any great degree,&quot; says Mr. Hatcher, who sees the mark soaring to 77 yen within three months if Japan's political problems remain.    Cross-trading has recently dominated foreign exchange dealings because the dollar has languished in range trading.    But market participants say the dollar could run into trouble at the end of the week if the July U.S. employment data, due Friday, support further easing by the Fed and trigger sales.    The jobless rate probably held steady at 5.3% in July, while nonfarm payrolls are seen having risen about 150,000 after gaining 180,000 in June, according to an early survey of economists polled by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report. Unexpectedly weak data could knock the dollar under support at 1.85 marks, says Mr. Hatcher. But he says the dollar &quot;becomes very bottomish at 135 yen&quot; because of uncertainties about Japan's government.    At the close of New York dealings Friday, the dollar traded at 1.8805 marks and 139.20 yen, off from 1.9125 and 142.25 a week earlier.    In trading Monday in Tokyo, the dollar opened at 138.90 yen, down from Friday's close there at 139.45.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York Friday, gold for current delivery plummeted $6.70 to $367 an ounce. Estimated volume was a very heavy 7.5 million ounces.    In early trading in Hong Kong Monday, gold was quoted at $368.35 an ounce. </TEXT></DOC>
