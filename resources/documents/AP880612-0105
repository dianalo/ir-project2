(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The successful farmer of the future maybe the one who pays the closest attention to the futures, say a newbreed of computerized farmers who deal directly with the nation'scommodities exchanges.   Clyde Hagemann, 44, who grows soybeans and corn and fattensfeeder cattle on his family's 1,800-acre farm near this Kane Countycommunity, is typical of the new breed.   Although Hagemann wears a soiled cap from a fertilizer company,he doesn't resort to the marketing strategies many other farmers inhis area still use. Instead of delivering his corn and beans to thelocal elevator every year and selling them through a forwardcontract, Hagemann sells his crops and cattle months in advance incomplex contracts directly on the Chicago Board of Trade and theChicago Mercantile Exchange.   Hagemann's computer and his constant electronic display ofcommodity price quotes are as important to his farming as hiscombine and his corn dryer.   Experts say that by using the futures exchanges to market theirproducts, farmers can obtain price stability _ particularly involatile markets like the one being driven by the current drought _along with marketing versatility, and they can maximize profits.   Hagemann told the Chicago Tribune recently that he has beendealing directly with the exchanges for 20 years, which makes himsomething of a pioneer in the process, used by only 10 to 15percent of the nation's farmers.   Farm experts, commodities brokers and farm economy consultantssay farmers who learn the new marketing techniques have a definiteadvantage over their more tradition-bound neighbors.   ``The family farm is romantic history,'' says consultant DanMarkey, who conducts marketing seminars for farmers throughout thenation. ``Farmers must use modern business tools if they are tosurvive, and that specifically includes the use of futures andoptions.''   Another farmer who hedges by selling and buying futures andoptions contracts is Robert B. Johnson, 44, who operates a3,000-acre corn, soybean and hog farm east of De Kalb. Johnson, whostudied the marketing techniques at a local junior college, says hedoesn't understand the attitude of other farmers who stageddemonstrations outside the Board of Trade some years back toprotest what they believed was price manipulation.   ``The speculator does not set the price of the commodity; ratherthe market sets the price,'' says Johnson.   Nonetheless, Johnson and others advise them to make a seriousstudy of marketing techniques before attempting to use them.   ``You cannot get too close to the market; particularly duringthese times of extreme price volatility,'' warns computerizedShabbona farmer Rob Mullins, 23. ``A lot of farmers come in hereand just watch the quotes as they come across the screen, when theyshould be out watching their crops.''</TEXT></DOC>
