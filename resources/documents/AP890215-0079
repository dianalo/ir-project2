James Oakey, 57, told U.S. District Judge James Holderman beforesentencing Tuesday that he had ``sunk as low as I can sink.''   ``It's a terrible way to end a legal career,'' said Oakey, aformer Cook County circuit judge.   Under a plea-agreement, Holderman could have sentenced Oakey toup to eight years in prison on racketeering charges involving bribeshe admitted paying to the former chief judge of the Traffic Court,Richard LeFevour.   LeFevour was convicted of corruption in another Greylord case andis serving a 12-year federal prison sentence.   In 1982 and 1983, Oakey had left the bench and was practicinglaw. He admitted paying $200 to $300 a week so he could drum upbusiness from defendants in the courtrooms.   Oakey said he started hustling defendants in the courtroom afterhe lost his judgeship in 1975, following allegations that he had animproper relationship with a private security firm.   However, Assistant U.S. Attorney Scott Mendeloff said theprosecution had evidence that Oakey was taking money to fix caseseven while on the bench.   Mendeloff said nearly 100 people have been sentenced in theOperation Greylord investigation of corruption in the Cook Countycourt system.   Oakey's six-year sentence will run concurrently with an 18-monthprison term he is already serving for tax evasion.</TEXT></DOC>
