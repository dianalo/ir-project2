The all-male orchestra promised a hypermacho program: all nine of Beethoven's symphonies, all five of his piano concertos, and his overtures, under Claudio Abbado and with pianist Maurizio Pollini.    It was a press agent's dream. The program itself commanded attention, proclaimed itself as monumental. Then there was the potential drama of watching the intricate Mr. Abbado, recently arrived in Vienna from La Scala in Milan, try to enforce his musical will on the notably self-possessed Philharmonic. And there was the even more intricate Mr. Pollini, prodigious technician, cool-hearted modernist, Milanese intellectual.    Would this week of masterpieces collapse of its own weight? Or would it launch the new series of Deutsche Grammophon recordings for which it was, in a not-very-subtle way, a live ad? Finally, to be crude about it, was the whole business worth almost a solid week of evenings for the unprecedented top price of $75 a seat?    The link between money and music has rarely been so vividly put before us, or so conveniently. And in the crush of the intermission crowd in the still-unrefurbished Carnegie Cafe, for example, you could make out financier Henry R. Kravis (&quot;$10,000 or more,&quot; according to the program, but less than $25,000) holding the full attention of the hall's president, violinist Isaac Stern (&quot;$150,000 or more&quot; but less than $250,000). Mrs. Kravis is the much-photographed dress designer known to fashion as Carolyne Roehm. She is also a Beethovenian, but the most Beethovenian couturier in all of New York was Oscar de la Renta. His friends, including Annette Reed ($150,000 or more), who sat next to him, provided support for the Vienna series &quot;in recognition of his deep interest in music and his assistance to Carnegie Hall.&quot;    It is, of course, a short distance along Seventh Avenue from Carnegie Hall to the heart of the garment industry, but it is an even shorter trip along much the same route to the leading local newspaper, whose critics went elsewhere for four of the six Vienna concerts, thereby missing all but one of Mr. Pollini's appearances.    Lacking the usual guidance on what to think about a concert, I took to buttonholing acquaintances in the audience. Almost no one refused to opine, or shrugged me off, saying, &quot;Gee, I dunno. I wish the Times had sent someone last night.&quot;    On the basis of my informal sampling, there was remarkable consensus on several matters. Everyone polled had noticed and greatly admired the Philharmonic's oboes and brass, which are built differently from the ones common in our orchestras, and seem to have more character. And you could hear them with wonderful clarity. The peach-and-gilt new interior of the hall showed itself off acoustically to best advantage for the Philharmonic, whose string sections sounded rich and distinct among each other. The assembled donors could feel proud of their gift to New York musical life, but were too discreet to boast.    They were willing, however, to speculate freely on the unresolvable question of whether Mr. Abbado was truly in charge or, if so, whether that was a good thing. Smart money came out saying that the comparatively subdued maestro had ratcheted his players a notch or two above their usual level of intensity.    Mr. Pollini did not have complex problems of identity or institutional politics to combat. He had only himself to discipline, and he was equal to the challenge. Small and undramatic, he appears to have the strongest wrists outside organized baseball. With a minimum of body English or even arm movement, he is able to extract whatever sounds he wants from the piano by moving his remarkable hands at the wrist. And when he stood up to acknowledge the audience's loud praise, those hands would waggle like separate creatures. He reminded one woman of a surgeon washing up before an operation.    His performance was surgical, meaning clean and accurate, with arpeggios shimmering up and down the octaves, each note in place. These luxurious cascades invariably came to an end with aplomb, leaving Mr. Pollini ideally positioned to move ahead with the next musical idea.    Not everyone cottoned to this approach. One haunter of concert halls and opera houses confessed that &quot;Pollini is too intellectual for me.&quot; But the man said this before Mr. Pollini had played the Emperor, letting himself, but never his technique, go to the point where he moved rhythmically with the orchestra when he had no notes to play himself. At climactic moments, he even used his whole arms and shoulders.    New York's Vienna week ended Friday with a jubilant Choral Symphony, big but not bombastic. If anyone was bored after a week of such warhorses played back to back, I never met him. Or her. </TEXT></DOC>
