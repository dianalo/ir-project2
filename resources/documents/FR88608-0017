Board Res. No. 85-1007, 50 FR 48970(November 27, 1985). Pending final adoption of the proposed amendmentsand revisions, the Board, on April 21, 1988, provided public notice ofinterim procedures in order to assist claimants and other persons affectedby threatened actions by the FSLIC as Receiver in the filing of Requestsfor Expedited Relief, claims against the FSLIC as Receiver, and appealsfrom decisions of the FSLIC as Receiver. Board Res. No. 88-229, 53 FR 13105(April 21, 1988).The purpose of the proposed regulations is to provide a uniform procedureunder which persons seeking relief from actions threatened by the FSLICas Receiver for a failed institution, or seeking to recover funds or gainother relief from an FSLIC receivership, may exhaust their administrativeremedies at the Board. The Board regards such exhaustion of administrativeremedies as a prerequisite to the availability of judicial review of actionsby the FSLIC as Receiver. These proposed regulations supplement the regulationsproposed by the Board in its rulemaking, begun November 27, 1985, addressingthe powers of the FSLIC as Receiver.The Board wishes to clarify that, although the proposed regulations regardingclaims filed with the FSLIC as Receiver state that a loan participant maybe a claimant, the regulations do not purport to make a binding determinationthat all loan participants are claimants. The Board, in its Notice of ProposedRulemaking issued November 8, 1985, made it clear that the FSLIC as Receiverof an institution, the accounts of which are insured by the FSLIC, recognizesthe validity of certain secured obligations of insured institutions, enteredinto pursuant to legal authority, and the right of a secured creditor incertain circumstances to cause the liquidation of collateral. Further,the FSLIC as Receiver may recognize the holder of a participating interestin a loan in which the Receiver also holds a participating interest, orwhich the Receiver services, as one having an ownership interest and nota creditor of the insured institution in receivership. In the event, however,that a Receiver disputes a creditor's claim to a security interest in anasset of the institution or a participant's characterization of its status,the Receiver may require such creditor or other entity to establish itsclaimed status pursuant to these procedures; and the Receiver in such casesmay take such action as is deemed necessary to protect the Receiver's interestin any asset. Commenters are particularly directed to andSection; 575.2(i)(1)(iv)of the proposed regulations, which provides that ``Claimant'' may includeloan participants.Copies of the Board's administrative decisions are available from the Director,Information Services Section, Office of the Secretariat, Federal Home LoanBank Board, 1700 G St. NW., Washington, DC. The Board's administrativedecisions may also be accessed on the Westlaw and Lexis computer researchsystems.<ITAG tagnum="84">Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</ITAG>Pursuant to section 3 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 603,the Board is providing the following regulatory flexibility analysis:1. <T3>Reasons, objectives, and legal basis underlying the proposed rule.</T3>These elements are incorporated above in <T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION.</T2>2. <T3>Small entities to which the proposed rule would apply. </T3>The proposedrules would apply to all Claimants, Petitioners, and Receiverships withoutregard to size.3. <T3>Impact of the proposed rule on small entities. </T3>The Board believesthat the proposed rules will not have any disparate effect on small entities.The proposed rules are a refinement of existing procedures and would makeit easier for small businesses and/or individuals to represent themselvesbefore the Board without incurring extensive costs for legal services.4. <T3>Overlapping or conflicting federal rules. </T3>There are no known federalrules that duplicate, overlap, or conflict with this proposal.5. <T3>Alternatives to the proposed rule. </T3>In the above <T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION, </T2>the Board is soliciting comment onthe rule as proposed.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Parts 575, 576, and 577</ITAG>Savings and loan associations.Accordingly, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board hereby purposes to amendChapter V, by adding new Parts 575, 576, and 577, Subchapter D, ChapterV, Title 12, Code of Federal Regulations, as set forth below.<ITAG tagnum="72">SUBCHAPTER D_FEDERAL SAVINGS AND LOAN INSURANCE CORPORATION</ITAG>1.

These procedures are to befollowed by Special Representatives and managing officers of the receivershipsto assure compliance with the Federal Regulations governing the processingand determination of claims, and to insure uniformity of notices to claimants,documentation of claims, determination of the merits of claims by allowanceor disallowance in whole or in part, payment of claims, and the reviewprocess. Full compliance with and exhaustion of these procedures is a prerequisiteto review by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (``Bank Board''). Judicialreview of the disallowance in whole or in part of a claim against the assetsof the FSLIC as Receiver is available only after exhaustion of these proceduresand review and final agency action by the Bank Board.(b) The Bank Board, and its Office of General Counsel, have made it clearthat the FSLIC as Receiver of an institution, the accounts of which areinsured by the FSLIC, recognizes the validity of certain secured obligationsof insured institutions, entered into pursuant to legal authority, andthe right of a secured creditor in certain circumstances to cause the liquidationof collateral. Further, the FSLIC as Receiver may recognize the holderof a participating interest in a loan in which the Receiver also holdsa participating interest, or which the Receiver services, as one havingan ownership interest and not a creditor of the insured institution inreceivership.(c) The Bank Board, is providing these procedures, is not directing theFSLIC as Receiver to require such secured creditors to observe all suchnoticed procedures as a precondition of exercising valid liquidation rightspursuant to valid security contracts entered into by an insured institutionas authorized under its governing law prior to the appointment of the Receiver.Nor is the Bank Board directing the FSLIC as Receiver to subject such holdersof participating interests that are not creditors of the insured institutionin receivership generally to such procedures. In the event, however, thata Receiver disputes a creditor's claim to a security interest in an assetin which the institution has an interest or a participant's characterizationof its status, the Receiver may require such creditor or other entity toestablish its claimed status pursuant to these procedures; and the Receiverin such cases may take such action as is deemed necessary to protect theReceiver's interest in any asset.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 575.2</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definitions.</ITAG>For the purposes of these procedures, the procedures for Requests for Review,and the procedures for Requests for Expedited Relief, the following definitionsshall apply.(a) ``Administrative expenses of the association'' means those reasonableexpenses for services actually provided for the association by nonemployeeprofessionals, such as accountants, attorneys, appraisers or examiners,that in the opinion of the Special Representative actually benefited theassociation of the receivership estate.(b) ``Affected Person'' means a person, corporation, partnership or otherlegal entity that owns or has an interest in real or personal property,or is otherwise obligated on a debt which is secured by real or personalproperty, against which the Receiver threatens to take action that mayaffect, impair, diminish or terminate such interest.
