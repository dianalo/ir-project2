Due to the progress in thedevelopment of variance reduction techniques and the improvements ofcomputational techniques this method is of increasing importance. Thebasic ideas in application of Monte Carlo methods are briefly outlined.In more detail various possibilities of non-analog games and estimationprocedures are presented, problems in the field of optimizing the variancereduction techniques are discussed. In the last part some important internationalMonte Carlo codes and own codes of the authors are listed and specialapplications are described.</TEXT></DOC>
