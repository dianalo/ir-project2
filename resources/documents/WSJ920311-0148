The aim of this emphasis, after years of concentrating oncommercial real estate, is to head off problems before theydevelop.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We're doing a lot of consumer exams&quot; because late paymentrates have been rising with the unemployment rate, saidStephen Steinbrink, the acting comptroller of the currency.He said that examiners who monitor the health of 3,900national banks are looking at the full range of consumerlending, including credit-card debt and auto loans, to makesure that banks are adjusting their credit requirements toeconomic conditions.   A recent survey by the American Bankers Association showedthat delinquency rates on bank credit-card debt rose in thefourth quarter of 1991, while delinquency rates on auto loansmade by banks fell, although the share of auto loans morethan 30 days overdue remains significantly higher thanaverage.   For the past several years bank examiners have focusedprimarily on forcing banks to face up to billions of dollarsof souring commercial real estate loans. To cushionthemselves against losses, many banks have increasedloan-loss reserves, taken severe write-offs and bolsteredtheir capital positions. Partly as a result of crashing realestate values, nearly 1,200 banks have failed since 1985.   Mr. Steinbrink stressed that the banking system isn'tfacing anything approaching the shock of the real estatecollapse. &quot;I see some stabilization&quot; in banking conditions.&quot;The downturn that was going on seems to have subsided,&quot; Mr.Steinbrink told a group of reporters.   Still, he said his office, which regulates most thenation's largest banks, remains concerned about bankingstrains as the economy struggles to recover. &quot;You worry someabout home equity loans&quot; because house values have come downand borrowers have an &quot;automatic draw&quot; that allows anincrease in borrowing against a residence. The delinquencyrate on home equity lines of credit rose slightly in thefourth quarter, although it is down about 10% from the firstquarter, according to the ABA survey.   In addition, Mr. Steinbrink said that some large banks aremoving aggressively into &quot;middle-market and small-businessloans&quot; to replace lending relationships they have lost withbig companies that increasingly raise money directly in thecapital markets. He said it is important for banks torecognize that loans to smaller companies may &quot;require morehands-on experience&quot; than loans to blue chip customers.   Mr. Steinbrink, who became acting comptroller last weekupon the resignation of Comptroller Robert L. Clarke, alsosaid, &quot;We have our examiners monitoring the refinancing ofhome mortgages, just to make sure that they don't get intothe position of the savings and loan industry.&quot; In the 1980s,Sandamp;Ls financed long-term, fixed-rate mortgages with cheapshort-term deposits and then found their profits wiped outwhen short-term rates rose.   &quot;We don't tell them to stop making mortgages&quot; but ratherto match the maturity of the loan with the funding for theloans, Mr. Steinbrink explained.   Separately, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. adopted aprevious proposal to raise to $100,000 from $50,000 thethreshold for real estate transactions requiring appraisalsby state certified or licensed appraisers.   The change is a victory for banks, which argued that therequirement boosted the cost, paperwork and time required togrant credit. Appraisers, of course, opposed the change.   Banks will still be required to appraise real estatebefore making loans, but they will be able to use their ownstaff for loans under $100,000.</TEXT></DOC>
