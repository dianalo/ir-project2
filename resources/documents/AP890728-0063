(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two Greenpeace U.S.A. ships sailedtoward an off-limits danger zone today to try to halt the testlaunch of a Navy Trident 2 missile from a submerged submarine,protest leaders said.   A motorized inflatable raft carrying three members of theenvironmental group was within 100 yards of the surfaced submarinethis morning, a Greenpeace spokesman said.   ``The inflatable was warned over the radio it is in danger,''spokesman Steve Shallhorn said by ship radio to Miami from the M.V.Greenpeace. That ship was several miles from the submarine USSTennessee, he said.   ``We can see the submarine being escorted by a destroyer,''Shallhorn said, adding that the activists didn't plan to leave thearea.   Greenpeace contends its vessels are free to enter the Navy-setdanger zone because it is in international waters.   Earlier today, Lt. Jim Wood, a Navy spokesman at Port Canaveral,said the Navy was aware of Greenpeace's protest plans but would notsay say what action it would take. He also would not confirm thetest launch. The Navy does not announce Trident launches in advance.   ``We plan just to enter the security zone for a non-violentpeaceful protest,'' Greenpeace member Joel Clement said Thursday.``We're not trying to begin any kind of a confrontation. We arecampaigning for nuclear-free seas.''   The security zone is a large area of the Atlantic more than 30miles east of Cape Canaveral that is placed off-limits tonon-essential ships during a submarine test-firing. The Navy wouldnot disclose the exact size of the area.   Ships in the zone could be hit by missile debris in the event ofa misfiring. Normally, a countdown would be stopped if a shipwandered into the off-limits sector.   It would be the second underwater test firing of the Trident 2,the Navy's newest, most powerful nuclear-armed missile. The firsttest, in March, ended in an explosion when the $23.7 million weaponpinwheeled out of control four seconds after it cleared the surface.   In addition to the M.V. Greenpeace, a 190-foot vessel flying theDutch flag, the organization sent out the Monticivitano, a 60-footsailing ketch under Swedish registry.   The Monticivitano, with seven people on board, left Fort Pierce,about 70 miles south of here, on Thursday. The Greenpeace, withabout 20 on board, set off a few hours later from Daytona Beach, 60miles north.   The Navy has said it plans to have the Trident 2 operational andon sea patrol by next March. The weapon has a range of 4,600 milesand each can carry up to eight nuclear warheads.   The Navy plans to develop a 21-submarine force carrying Trident2 missiles at a cost of about $155 billion over the vessels'30-year lifetime, according to a report from the congressionalGeneral Accounting Office.</TEXT></DOC>
