But instead of firing a bullet, thenew president dropped a bomb.   &quot;The monetary contraction we imposed on society isfantastic,&quot; acknowledges Ibrahim Eris, one of the architectsof the harsh anti-inflation plan and now the president of thecentral bank. &quot;It's probably the first time in the world thata country in time of peace has practically destroyed itsmonetary standard and replaced it.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Under the plan, Mr. Collor didn't just restrict credit orcut spending, as other governments here have done. He frozeabout 70% of the money circulating in the economy for 18months, until the fall of next year, and also replaced theold currency, the cruzado novo, with a new, strictlycontrolled one, the cruzeiro. If money causes inflation, thethinking goes, then removing money removes inflation.   The results have come faster than it takes to sayhyperinflation. Inflation, which reached 84.32% in Marchalone and totaled 4,854% in the 12 months through March,halted completely -- in fact, prices fell -- in the monthfollowing the unveiling of the plan, the government says.(However, some trade unions and economists disagree, chargingthat the index is based on an incomplete basket of goods.)   But in stopping inflation, the government has also stoppedthe economy. &quot;To kill the cockroach, they set the apartmenton fire,&quot; complains former Economic Planning Minister AntonioDelfim Netto.   Deprived of cash, consumers stopped buying, companiesstopped producing and exporters stopped exporting. Then,afraid that it had paralyzed the country, the governmentstarted re-injecting money into the system to the point thatsome feared a revival of inflation, and the government closedthe tap again. Although the government terms all this as onlya short, predictable phase and says economic activity ispicking up again, many economists and businessmen think thatBrazil has simply traded inflation for recession -- and couldend up with both if the government errs in its efforts torevive the economy.   Almost overnight, with the drop in inflation -- and inbank accounts -- the habits of Brazil's nearly 150 millionpeople have changed. Companies that had cash in the banksuddenly have to beg for loans at exorbitant interest ratesjust to meet their payrolls. People who wouldn't have beencaught dead with cash in their pockets because inflation wasshrinking its value by the minute rushed to the bank towithdraw all the money they could to stash it undermattresses. And all of a sudden, the rich were poorer, andthe poor felt richer.   Antonio Ermirio de Moraes, the extremely wealthy chief ofGrupo Votorantim, Brazil's largest private industrial group,declared on television that he was stuck with little moneyfor himself and had to get a bank loan to pay his group's60,000 employees after $500 million of its reserves werefrozen. So depressed was the workaholic Mr. Ermirio that hetook a swim in his pool for the first time in 36 years ofmarriage, his wife says.   Meanwhile, Claudio Teller de Silva, a 23-year-old who losthis truck-driving job, says he can buy a used VolkswagenBeetle with the unemployment benefits he will get. &quot;If I'dbeen fired in a time of high inflation, I couldn't have donethat,&quot; he says as he waits in line at an unemployment officein Sao Paulo.   The drastic liquidity squeeze, the government says, wasdesigned just that way. &quot;Our directive was to liquidateinflation fast without the working class footing most of thebill,&quot; says Economics Minister Zelia Cardoso de Mello. Tomake the well-heeled do the sacrificing, the government frozefunds in savings accounts in excess of 50,000 cruzados novos(about $1,000 at the official rate). It also froze all fundsabove 25,000 cruzados novos or 20% of total funds --whichever was higher -- in short-term, interest-bearinginstruments.   These limits and the rest of the plan were set in a seriesof secret meetings of a small team of economists after Mr.Collor's mid-December election. Examining Brazil's threefailed anti-inflation plans since 1986, as well as similarplans in countries such as Argentina, Bolivia and Israel, &quot;wecame to the conclusion that the core problem was theexplosion of demand&quot; that accompanied more traditional policyinstruments such as wage-and-price freezes coupled withcredit restrictions, Mr. Eris says. So, by late January, theteam decided it had to reduce the amount of money in theeconomy.   &quot;We took the plan to the president practically as itstands today but without details,&quot; Mr. Eris says. &quot;We held ameeting with a blackboard and all that, and the presidentaccepted all our arguments in favor of a freeze of assets. Hewas quickly convinced we had no alternative.&quot; But he adds:&quot;After we decided, we were extremely nervous . . . worriedabout the consequences of our decisions.&quot;   Rightly so, many now say, even if they think that the planmakes sense theoretically and gives Brazil a salutary shock.&quot;At a macroeconomic level, the plan is fine,&quot; says RobertoCivita, the president of Editora Abril, Latin America'slargest publishing group. &quot;But guess what the sum ofeverybody cutting here and canceling there is? The way itlooks from here is a big recession.&quot;   Mr. Civita knows first-hand about cutting here andcanceling there. &quot;We have cut all the costs we could imagineexcept toilet paper and people,&quot; he says. The publisher ofabout 150 magazines, including the respected newsweekly Veja,Mr. Civita says newsstand sales have dropped about one-third,although subscriptions have picked up slightly, andadvertising has fallen 50% since the plan was enacted. Thedecline in revenue has forced Abril to put off its plannedAugust launch of MTV. &quot;The tower was going up, the buildingwas being put up, people were being hired -- and we told theconstruction company: `Stop]'&quot; Mr. Civita says.   In addition, Abril has cut its auto fleet by 60%,suspended the publication of special issues and stoppedlunches with clients, all purchases of nonessential goods andcorporate travel. &quot;Nobody's going anywhere,&quot; Mr. Civita says.Because Abril had adopted a strategy of having no cash onhand by March 15, none of its money was frozen. But cash flowstopped. &quot;We've thrown out the profit-and-loss statement,&quot;Mr. Civita says. Now, &quot;we're thinking only of cash flow&quot; topay bills and salaries. To meet the April payroll, Abril hadto take out a bank loan at almost 30% interest, and &quot;May willbe even worse,&quot; Mr. Civita predicts. At one printing plant,the workweek has been cut by a day with a matching pay cut,and the group may adopt such tactics across the board.   The problems are even worse for small companies, such asJacques Memran's wire maker near Sao Paulo. The company,which employs 30 people and mostly makes wire spirals fornotebooks, is &quot;completely stopped&quot; and its employees are onpaid leave, Mr. Memran says. &quot;I haven't fired anyone yet, buthow long can this last?&quot; he asks. Paper companies &quot;aren'tmaking any orders. They're trying to make cruzeiros byselling inventory to be able to make new orders. It's avicious circle,&quot; he says.   Mr. Memran voted for Mr. Collor but describes the plan as&quot;a bad surprise.&quot; He is particularly incensed at the freezingof 800,000 cruzados novos that the company had put in theovernight market -- a sort of one-day government bond inwhich many Brazilians invested to hedge against inflation.&quot;The money we had wasn't to speculate,&quot; he says. &quot;It was tobe able to meet our next payroll. In times of high inflation,we were obliged to invest our money on the market to preserveits value. Taking our money is a real aggression. Not onlydid Collor take our savings, but he also took our workingcapital.&quot; Mr. Memran adds that if the Collor plan &quot;continueslike this, only the big will survive. And the big aren'tgoing to absorb all the people we're going to put out on thestreet.&quot;   Indeed, many Brazilians believe that although Mr. Collorsaid he wanted to spare the poor, the poor in fact will paythe biggest price in the medium term if the incipientrecession sparks mass unemployment. The middle classes arealready feeling the pinch. &quot;Collor said the plan would affectthe elite and help the `descamisados'&quot; -- the shirtlesspeople. &quot;We're discovering we were the elite, and now we'rethe shirtless,&quot; says Luiz Carlos Mansur, a 27-year-old copyeditor in the sports department of Jornal do Brasil in Rio deJaneiro.   With advertising low, the newspaper is paying salaries ininstallments as money flows in, and staffers are never sureof getting their full pay. Mr. Mansur's wife, Teresa, whogives private classes in Portuguese and French, recently losttwo of her five students. And since the plan was enacted, theMansurs have had to tighten their belts. They rarely go outto eat. They've stopped buying books and clothes. They'vefired their maid. Now, they're considering moving back tolive with Mrs. Mansur's mother.   &quot;Every day you wake up, and you don't know what willhappen,&quot; Mr. Mansur says. &quot;You can lose your money, your job,part of your salary.&quot; Adds his wife: &quot;I'd think the plan wasgood if I had the same amount as money as before and noinflation. But to know that prices aren't rising when youcan't buy anything isn't very satisfying.&quot;   Others say the plan, though harsh, may yield somethingsatisfying: the notion that Brazil will finally get its acttogether.   &quot;Unemployment and recession are a price we have to pay tostop the casino economy we lived in, where the poor gotpoorer and the rich got richer,&quot; says Sergio Haberfeld, thechairman of Toga, a packaging company whose production hasfallen about 25% since the plan was announced. &quot;People madeprofits on inflation and on their cash surplus. Now, it willbe profit on efficiency and productivity.&quot;   For that to happen, however, the government will have tomatch the sacrifices of the private sector, economists say.The paradox of the plan is that although Mr. Collor waselected on a free-market platform and vowed to reduce thestate's role, the plan's initial phase concentrates so muchpower in his hands that Lawrence Pih, a businessman, speaksof the &quot;Popular Republic of Brazil.&quot;   Economists are waiting to see how the government willhandle the ban on most government subsidies, the closure ofseveral state agencies, and the planned sale to the privatesector of most of Brazil's state-owned companies and of manygovernment houses and cars. Many say that if the governmentwants permanently low inflation, it has to attack thepublic-sector deficit through tougher spending cuts than ithas enacted so far. &quot;About 10,000 people losing their jobs inthe public sector is very little compared to what we'realready seeing in the informal economy and what we'll see inthe financial, auto and construction sectors,&quot; says CarlosLangoni, a former central-bank president.   Meeting with cabinet members and government congressionalleaders yesterday, Mr. Collor exhorted them to move faster onprivatization and cut 20% to 25% of Brazil's 1.6 milliongovernment workers.   Meanwhile, the government's efforts to re-inject moneyinto the most affected sectors, such as the automobile,construction and capital-goods industries, have to becarefully calibrated to reignite business activity withoutreigniting inflation. That will be all the harder because theplan has disorganized the country's financial system anddestroyed confidence in savings -- a problem that governmentofficials admit they underestimated. Since the plan wasannounced, the government has kept on printing money tosatisfy people's demand for cash, and that, in turn, couldtrigger a paradoxical consumer boom in the midst of aneconomic downturn.   &quot;We're walking on a very narrow road,&quot; the central bank'sMr. Eris concedes. &quot;On one side is the precipice ofrecession; on the other is inflation. Today, society thinkswe're walking close to recession, but the road is so narrowwe could fall the other way. Our problem today is trying toadminister this so we don't fall on either side.&quot;   Mr. Eris also admits that the plan &quot;has implications thataren't clear. Talk of recession or depression and talk of anexplosion of demand prove the economy hasn't found itsequilibrium.&quot; Inflation, he says, &quot;has been knocked down, andthe judge has counted to three. When he says 10, we'll be inanother world.&quot; But both he and Economics Minister Cardosoare confident of steering the economy through the twin perilsof inflation and recession.   If they succeed, economists say, they will have laid thefoundations to allow Brazil, at long last, to live up to itshuge potential. If they fail, Brazil will have &quot;exhausted theeconomic encyclopedia&quot; of ways to cure inflation, Mr. Langonisays. The results, all agree, won't be clear for at leastanother couple of months.   &quot;We're going to have a terrific decade,&quot; Abril's Mr.Civita says. &quot;All we have to do is get over the next twomonths. I'm sure there's a promised land at the end of thedesert. The question is: Is there enough water in the canteento make it across?&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
