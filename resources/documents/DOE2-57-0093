The pH, the electricalconductivity, the total dissolved solids and the concentration of Al,Ca, Cl, Cr, Fe, K, Mg, Mn and Na were measured in the resulting lixiviates.The pH of the water seems to have little effect on all these parametersbut they are significantly influenced by the nature of the solid material.(author) 6 refs.; 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
