Ada,governor of the U.S. territory located only 1,150 miles from Tokyo.   From 1941-44, Guam suffered through some of the most brutaltreatment ever inflicted on an American community. Survivors recallmassacres, beatings, forced labor and other horrors.   But the United States ``most unfortunately gave away our right toreparation from the Japanese in its 1951 peace treaty with Japan ...without anybody once asking our people,'' according to Ada.   The Bush administration opposes reparations, saying the U.S.government spent $8 million immediately after the war on 4,200death, personal injury and property damage claims.   ``There is no reason for the American taxpayers to pay furthercompensation for World War II claims arising from enemy action,''said Larry L. Morgan of the Interior Department, which in 1950 tookover responsibility for Guam from the Navy.   A Guam Reparations Commission appointed this year asked forcompensation totaling $160 million to include payments for deaths,injuries, forced labor, forced marches or internment.   The waiver of Japanese reparations, granted early in the KoreanWar, ``was a policy decision of the United States to conclude aquick treaty with Japan ... to turn Japan into a valuable Asian allyand a bulwark against communist expansion,'' Ada said.   Ada appeared last month at a hearing on Guam war reparationslegislation introduced by Ben Blaz, Guam's non-voting delegate inthe House of Representatives. The measure faces more hearings and apossible committee vote later this year.   The island of 212 square miles _ about one-sixth the size ofRhode Island _ was acquired from Spain in 1898 after theSpanish-American War. It remains a key U.S. Pacific military base.   Japanese still invade Guam, but this time as tourists boostingthe island's main civilian industry, accounting for most of the500,000 annual visitors to Guam's beaches.   Blaz and Ada say the new payments are justified in light of $67million paid in Micronesian war claims and the $20,000 authorized byCongress for each Japanese-American interned during World War II.   Too little time was allowed for filing claims after the war andthere was confusion over the eligibility of Guam natives, whoreceived U.S. citizenship only in 1950, said Blaz.   Guam senator Eddie Duenas said: ``Apparently, many who wereeligible failed to file mostly because they did not know about it orwere too preoccupied rebuilding their shattered lives.''   A Guamanian woman, Mrs. Beatrice Perez Emsley, recalled duringthe summer hearings that as a girl of 13 she regained consciousnessin a mass grave of decapitated and mutilated Chamorros, nativetribespeople.   She said a Japanese soldier had tossed her there withoutrealizing that his attempt to behead her had failed because he useda bayonet instead of sword.   ``I could not breathe from the pain in my neck and head and thedirt was beginning to choke me ... I had to bear the pain and keepstill or else those Japanese soldiers would stab me or shoot me,''she said.   Mrs. Emsley, now 58, said she finally crawled into the jungle andwandered for a week until another Guamanian fugitive found her.Years later, they met members of the U.S. 3rd Marine Division whowere liberating the island.   Reparations ``will not remove from us the awful memories of thehorrors we witnessed or experienced,'' she said, but they ``willshow us just that somebody cares about what happened to us.''   Duenas, the senator, said that the United States made deathpayments ranging as low as $221 and high as $3,500 to 750 people onGuam after the war.   Island residents maintain that 8 percent to 10 percent of thepopulation, or up to 2,000 people, were killed and 90 percentsuffered severe hardship, injury or disease.   The Blaz bill contained an initial authorization for $20 million,specifying $20,000 for the estates of those killed, $15,000 forpersonal injury, $10,00 for forced labor and $7,000 for forced marchor internment.</TEXT></DOC>
