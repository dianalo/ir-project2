Economists say the Bank of Japan, the country's central bank, has indicated through actions over the past week that it wants to guide domestic interest rates lower at least temporarily, reversing a gradual tightening that occurred during much of the past quarter.    The central bank's new stance, which economists describe as subtle and probably no more permanent than the exchange rates that enabled it, suggests authorities believe inflation is receding as a near-term threat in Japan. Only a month ago, the central bank was constricting credit and warning openly that certain conditions, especially signs of higher prices or a markedly weaker yen, would force a general increase in interest rates.    Yesterday, the central bank allowed money brokers to trim key one- and three-month interbank rates by 1/16 of a percentage point to 4 3/16% and 4 5/16%, respectively, down from around 4 1/2% last month. On Monday, the bank took the unusual step of letting the two-month rate drop by 1/16 point to 4 1/4% -- on the exact day when market participants had expected the seasonal effect of year-end demand to take effect and force higher rates.    The central bank yesterday also bought 100 billion yen ($787 million) in three-month certificates of deposit at 4.6%, a shade below the prevailing market rate of about 4.7% and down from about 5% last month. It was the third consecutive day that the authorities sought through market activities to nudge down money-market rates.    &quot;They certainly do give the impression that they are steering a somewhat easier policy,&quot; said William Sterling, a Japan economist for Merrill Lynch Japan Inc.    Responding to the central bank's latest actions, Japan's stock market shook off its recent lethargy and scored a 151.69-point gain to close yesterday at 27,293.67.    Japan's official discount rate, on which the country's short-term prime lending rate is based, has remained at a post-World War II low of 2.5% since February 1987. While that rate has remained fixed, all of the world's other democratic industrialized countries have raised main official rates, and as recently as last month economists were predicting that Japan would have to follow soon.    Then, as now, the yen's value against the dollar was the bank's chief concern in setting policy. Not only are exchange rates a sensitive political and trade subject with other countries, but a significant strengthening of the U.S. currency would tend to boost prices in Japan, which pays for most of its imports in dollars. Compounding those concerns, the year-to-year rate of money-supply growth in Japan was averaging more than 11%, capital spending was high and many analysts feared the economy was overheating. Thus, when the dollar managed a late-summer rally, the central bank was quick to boost money-market and interbank rates.    Since the start of this month, though, conditions have enabled the authorities to alter policy. Most important, the dollar has fallen from a trading range of 133 yen and 135 yen at the end of last month to 125 yen to 127 yen now.    In addition, the price of oil -- Japan's biggest single import -- has been undermined by internal frictions within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. That could further reduce the threat of inflation in Japan.    Even economic fundamentals point to lower rates. Japan's economic growth has tapered off, with the economy contracting at an annualized rate of 3.9% in the second quarter of this year after expanding at an 11.2% clip in the first period, and its trade surplus resumed its growth.    &quot;Unless the {U.S. Federal Reserve} tightens credit and the yen weakens, the {Bank of Japan} now has some room to be less worried about inflation,&quot; said Toshihiko Matsumoto, senior economist at Industrial Bank of Japan, a private-sector bank.    The Japanese central bank's policy isn't just the product of opportunity, though. There are some clear reasons for it to ease policy. Indeed, a few analysts speculate that the government has been loosening the monetary reins to reduce the liquidity drain of a 2.85 trillion-yen ($22.42 billion) issue of stock in the state-controlled telecommunications company, Nippon Telegraph andamp; Telephone Co. The issue was priced yesterday and will be distributed this month.    &quot;It will be easier to see what's going on once NTT is out of the way,&quot; said Marshall Gittler, a bond-market analyst at UBS Phillips andamp; Drew International Ltd. </TEXT></DOC>
