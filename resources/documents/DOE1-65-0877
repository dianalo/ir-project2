Four kinetic rate constantswere determined with a least square fitting package SALS (StatisticalAnalysis with Least Squares), using the measured data of /sup 18/F activityas a function of time. SALS calculations were found to be easy and quickwith high precision. The rate constants and the curves fitted by thek/sub 3/* and the k/sub 4/* models were compared in situations with variousdegree of cerebral glucose metabolism during positron emission tomography(PET) studies. The k/sub 4/* model in the determination of cerebral metabolicrate for glucose (CMR/sub qlu/) was much superior than the k/sub 3/*model in any given situation as it always understimates the metabolicrate. However, the k/sub 3/* model produces less variation when the cerebralradioactivity curve shows steady rising pattern.</TEXT></DOC>
