So far,he's donated 100,000 pounds of produce. But he doesn't considerhimself a do-gooder, just a veteran gardener enjoying a productive_ and fruitful _ retirement.</TEXT><BYLINE>By NANCY SHULINS</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Newsfeatures Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>HAMDEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   When Bill Liddell first contacted theConnecticut Food Bank, Nancy Carrington ``envisioned yet anotherguy with half a bag of tomatoes and cucumbers.''   ``He presented himself very modestly, a guy growing a garden andhaving some surplus to donate,'' says Carrington, the food bank'sinterim director.   But the tall, rumpled man with scrambled white hair who showedup had 50 pounds of summer squash, followed in short order by 350pounds more. The squash harvested, he moved on to sweet corn, thentomatoes. Just after Labor Day, he started on greens.   By the end of the summer of 1985, Liddell had delivered 7,000pounds of produce to the food bank's warehouse in New Haven. Thestaff was impressed, but he brushed off their thanks.   ``You ain't seen nothing,'' he said. ``Wait'll next year.''   ``A little better organized'' in 1986, Liddell donated 16,000pounds of home-grown vegetables.   In 1987, he topped 26,000 pounds.   Last year, when the skies dried up and the sun beat down untilthe soil cracked like an over-baked cake, Liddell harvested 28,000pounds of food from his rocky three-fifths of an acre, all of itdestined for Connecticut's poor.   But don't get the wrong idea about Bill Liddell. Just because aguy spends 40 hours a week on his 69-year-old knees growing foodfor the poor, and urges others to follow his example, is no reasonto brand him a do-gooder.   ``I'm no Mother Teresa,'' he says.   What he is is a veteran gardener who found himself face-to-facewith retirement, a divorced father of four grown kids with nohobbies beyond the joys of coaxing fruit, flowers and vegetablesout of the recalcitrant earth.   As Bill Liddell sees it, his giveaway garden is less an act ofaltruism than an act of survival.   ``I've known retired people with more money than they know whatto do with, but they've had jaws down to here,'' he says, cupping adirt-stained hand over his belt buckle.   ``I started out to keep doing what I've always done. It was not,`How can I help the poor?', but `What can I do with all this? Oh! Iwill give it to the poor.'''   Until a neighbor suggested a local shelter as a recipient of hisbountiful harvest, ``I knew zero about the homeless.''   One might assume that a man who spends so much time toiling onbehalf of the hungry and homeless would have pondered the matter,but, ``I really don't think about it that much. It's toodistressing.   ``It's a national obscenity. I shouldn't be having to do thisstuff. It's not the way the ball game should be run.''   End of discussion. Rather than ruminate about politics, heprefers to contemplate the heft of a cabbage or the sweetness of alettuce, raising his voice to be heard over the locusts' buzz.   It is difficult to lure Liddell out from between the neat,weedless rows of Anaheim chilies and turnip greens. Guests findthemselves conversing with the muddy soles of his shoes or hisrapidly retreating back as he strides off in mid-sentence to yank aweed or pulverize a beetle.   ``He's very single-minded, but a lot of fun to work with,'' saysJean Heston, one of Liddell's ``migrant workers,'' 16 men and womenwho take turns helping plant, weed or pick.   ``It's one of the enjoyments of my retirement,'' says Heston,who signed up after Liddell made an appeal at Spring Glen Church.``He's not a believer, but he does have that instinct to do forsomebody else. He comes to church twice a year, at the beginning toask for volunteers, and at the end to say thanks.''   In the four years since he began, Liddell has seen his producebecome a staple on soup kitchen menus around New Haven, thenation's seventh poorest city in per capita income.   The city of 125,000 has two soup kitchens; a third lost itslease several months ago and runs a food pantry while searching fornew quarters.   At the Community Soup Kitchen, which serves 75,000 meals a year,``It's hard to describe how much Bill Liddell means to us,'' sayscoordinator David O'Sullivan. ``Very often we get donations fromall kinds of people, and they're all welcome.   ``But what do you do when someone shows up with five pounds oftomatoes and you've got 200 people lined up outside? Bill growsfood in quantities we need, and it's all first-rate stuff.''   The fruits of his labors were instrumental in helping the soupkitchen expand from soup and bread to full meals.   The Connecticut Food Bank, where Liddell delivers hisvegetables, is at the heart of a network that distributes food to350 agencies around the state. Soup kitchens, shelters and foodpantries ``shop'' at the warehouse, paying up to 12 cents a poundto cover overhead costs.   For the most part, the food bank subsists on throwaways from thefood industry, Carrington says. Liddell is ``our precedent-setter.He grows prime, lovely produce that's brought to the food bankwithin hours of being picked. He stands alone as an example of howa simple idea can have a really big impact on people in need.''</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
