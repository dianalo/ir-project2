Ferruzzi also will pay more than $1 million in exchangelegal fees. Exchange executives hope the stiff penalties willdeter big companies with the money and market savvy tomanipulate futures prices by hoarding available stocks ofgrain, which is at the heart of any attempt to corner acommodities market.</LP><TEXT>   The $3 million-plus in payments won't be much more than adrop in the bucket for Ferruzzi, a chemical, pharmaceuticaland agricultural conglomerate with annual sales of more than$15 billion. Yet people familiar with the case said legalnegotiations with the exchange were costing Ferruzzi anaverage of about $1 million a month, providing ampleincentive for the company to settle the charges. (Ferruzziitself must pay the exchange $1.65 million, and its Americanunit, Central Soya Co., was fined an additional $350,000.)   Ferruzzi remains unrepentant. It continues to deny that ittried to corner the soybean market, and a spokesman bristledat the CBOT's description of the $2 million payment as afine. The Ferruzzi spokesman insisted the payment was merelya way to end the company's expensive legal battle.   &quot;Ferruzzi didn't do anything wrong,&quot; said Larry Friedmanof Ferruzzi's outside public relations firm. &quot;This is theprice of dismissing the charges.&quot; Ferruzzi didn't make any ofits executives available for comment.   Under language of the settlement, which is typical of thecommodities industry, Ferruzzi neither admitted nor denied itwas guilty of the CBOT's charges of attempted manipulationand reckless trading, the exchange said.   The CBOT's Business Conduct Committee held closed hearingsin the case from September to December 1990, proceedings thatwould have remained secret but for Ferruzzi's unsuccessfulattempt to block them in federal court.   At the hearings, dozens of traders and others testifiedthat in early 1989, Ferruzzi accumulated a stake in soybeanfutures contracts entitling it to take delivery of about 23million bushels of soybeansvastly more than were availablefor delivery at the time. Meanwhile, the conglomerateacquired rights to about 75% of the 12 million bushels thatwere available in CBOT warehouses.   As the July delivery date for the futures contractsloomed, the CBOT invoked seldom-used emergency powers toforce Ferruzzi to liquidate its position. This kept theshortage of soybeans from pushing futures prices toartificially high levels. And as Ferruzzi liquidated, futuresprices plunged.   Ferruzzi later filed suit against the exchange, seekingdamages for its losses during the liquidation. As part ofFriday's settlement, Ferruzzi agreed to drop that lawsuit.&quot;This settlement puts the matter to rest,&quot; said exchangePresident Thomas R. Donovan.   The episode provoked intense debate within the grainindustry over whether the CBOT's delivery procedures, whichconcentrate all grain deliverable against futures contractsinto a few warehouses in Chicago and Toledo, are outdated.The CBOT since has proposed adding delivery warehouses in St.Louis.   As part of the settlement, Ferruzzi is resigning its onefull membership at the Chicago Board of Trade. This step islargely symbolic; the seat is being transferred to CentralSoya, which already held six CBOT seats.   &quot;It was a case of `You can't fire me, I quit,'&quot; said aCBOT official who asked not to be identified. &quot;They couldeither continue to fight, and possibly get a bigger fine andprobably have both Ferruzzi and Central Soya expelled, orthey could settle.&quot;   Looking ahead to commodity markets this week:                                                                                                          Energy                                                                                                          Crude-oil futures prices rallied late in the tradingsession Friday, boosted by lack of news from the U.N.-Iraqmeeting in Vienna and statements by Venezuela that it wasgoing to cut its oil output immediately.   Adjournment of the Vienna meeting where parties weretalking about terms for renewal of Iraqi oil exports removedthe threat that Iraqi crude would flow into the alreadyglutted market within weeks.   And the Venezuelan cut of 50,000 barrels a day, while onlya token amount, caused some market participants to speculatethat other members of the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries might follow suit. OPEC is scheduled to gather nextmonth in Geneva to discuss oil pricing and production.   Prices had been firm all day but buying became hectic nearthe trading close.   Separately, the New York Mercantile Exchange announced itwill begin trading sour crude-oil futures on Friday, Feb. 28.Each contract will represent 1,000 U.S. barrels.                                                                                                          Grains and Soybeans                                                                                                          Wheat futures prices are expected to rise today on theheels of a U.S. Agriculture Department report predicting thattight wheat supplies will continue.   The USDA's winter wheat seedings report, released aftertrading Friday, estimated that farmers seeded about 50million acres of wheat last fall, 2% less than a yearearlier. U.S. wheat stocks are low because of big exports tothe former Soviet Union and because bad growing weather hasreduced yields.   Wheat prices on the cash market were up strongly over thepast few months, and analysts say that trend is likely tocontinue.                                                                                                          Precious Metals                                                                                                          Traders are anxious to see whether Thursday's rally ingold, silver and platinum resumes or falters this week.   On Friday, gold for February delivery ended at $356.90 anounce, down 60 cents. March silver fell back 4.8 cents anounce to $4.105. April platinum gained 10 cents an ounce tofinish at $340.10.   William O'Neill, senior futures strategist at MerrillLynch, said a major rally is unlikely and, in fact, therecent lows could be retested. &quot;The market isn't out of thewoods yet,&quot; he said.   Despite last week's rally, the fundamentals of preciousmetals haven't changed much, he explained. The first quarterwill be a bottoming period for the precious metals, hepredicted, with prices showing modest strength later in theyear.  ---   Kevin G.
