(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Federal prosecutors will not seek any moreindictments against the targets of a 16-month grand juryinvestigation into Jim Bakker's leadership of the PTL ministries.   ``We do not expect to ask the grand jury to return any additionalindictments against anyone,'' said James Knapp, a deputy assistantattorney general who oversees the Justice Department's criminal taxinvestigations.   The grand jury indicted Bakker and three former associates onDec. 5, charging that they misused millions of dollars of PTL money.   Bakker and Richard Dortch, Bakker's former top deputy, arecharged with mail fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy. David Taggart,Bakker's former personal secretary, and James Taggart, PTL's formerinterior decorator, are charged with tax evasion and conspiracy.   Prosecutors and Justice Department officials considered seekingtax charges against Bakker and Dortch. But Assistant U.S. AttorneyJerry Miller said Thursday Bakker and Dortch would not be chargedwith any more crimes.   Bakker, Dortch, the Taggart brothers and Roe Messner, PTL's chiefbuilder under Bakker, had been identified as targets of theinvestigation.   Messner was not named in the indictment.   Bakker, 48, resigned in 1987 amid revelations he had a sexualencounter with former church secretary Jessica Hahn and paid herhush money. Three months later, amid reports of financialwrongdoing, PTL filed for bankruptcy.   On Tuesday, Canadian real estate magnate Stephen Mernick, anOrthodox Jew, bought PTL's assets, including its Christian themepark, hotel and broadcast studios in Fort Mill, S.C., for $65million in U.S. Bankruptcy Court.   The fate of the PTL's religious operations, which were spun offby the court into the non-profit Heritage Ministries, remainedunclear.
