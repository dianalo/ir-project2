NATO's relianceupon nuclear deterrence has allowed for Western restraint in the &quot;armsrace&quot; (in fact, NATO has consistently obtained from attempting to matchSoviet conventional capabilities in Central Europe) and for psychologicaland political flexibility with regard to a policy of detente. Furthermore,because of its nuclear strategy, NATO could retain a defensive conceptof ground operations despite significant military disadvantages and politicalburdens resulting from such a doctrine. In this way, NATO's force posturehas contributed to military and political stability in Central Europe.In contrast, the Soviet Union and her allies espouse an offensive strategicdoctrine for the European theatre, and they have developed and deployedtheir forces accordingly. It is a crucial question whether or not NATOcould retain its current form of a restrained, prudent, stabilizing defencevariant, were it forced to abandon its current concept of nuclear scalationin favour of a purely conventional defence strategy.</TEXT></DOC>
