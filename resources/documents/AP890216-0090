(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An advanced navigation satellite wasshifted into a circular orbit about 11,000 miles above the Earthtoday by the perfect firing of an onboard motor, the Air Forcereported.   The Navstar Global Positioning System satellite was launched hereTuesday into a preliminary elliptical orbit ranging from about 100to 11,000 miles high. After tracking the payload for two days, aground station sent a signal to trigger the motor.   ``It was a good 59-second burn; everything was nominal andeverything looks good,'' said Rick Huling, a spokeman for the AirForce Systems Division in Los Angeles.   Officials said ground controllers would check out the satellite'ssystems for between 30 and 45 days before placing it on operationalpatrol, joining seven earlier model Navstar satellites already inorbit.   The new Navstar GPS satellite, the first of a plannedconstellation of 21 payloads, is designed to tell U.S. and alliedmilitary forces exactly where they are within 50 feet anywhere onthe globe _ land, sea or air.   The satellite was launched by the Air Force's new Delta 2 spacerocket.</TEXT></DOC>
