No one was injured in the incident, which started at theWorkers' Compensation Board around 1:15 p.m., police said. The manpulled a gun in a hearing room and grabbed the two hostages, saidDetective Joseph McConville, a police spokesman.   The man was holed up inside the room with his two hostages untilabout 3:45 p.m., when he released one of them. Fifteen minuteslater, he turned the second attorney loose and surrendered topolice, said police spokesman Lt. Thomas Fahey.   Earlier, he had demanded that John Johnson, a local televisionnews reporter, come to the scene and had aired his grievances abouthis case to Johnson. And Workers' Compensation Board CharimanBarbara Patton agreed to review the case, which involved a 1984 caraccident that led to a settlement in December, authorities said.   The two lawyers were identified as Richard Kelman and RichardWolf. Initially, police had said one of the two lawyers was anadministrative law judge.   One of the attorneys had represented the gunman in his workers'compensation case, said Alice McGillion, deputy police commissionerfor public information.   ``Apparently, his grief is with the workmen's compensationboard,'' McGillion had said during the incident. ``We'll wait itout.''   The gunman's only demand was to meet with Johnson, McConvillesaid. The television newsman arrived shortly before 2:30 p.m.,riding in a police car with its sirens and lights on and cheered byworkers in the six-story office building.   The gunman complained to Johnson that he was being harassed overthe $20,000 settlement in his case.</TEXT></DOC>
