The Japanese market's capitalization reached an estimated $2.688 trillion last week, about 1% more than the U.S. market's $2.672 trillion, Morgan Stanley andamp; Co.'s Capital International unit says. The comparison is between all the stock markets in both countries; market capitalization is the total of the equities on the exchanges.    According to other estimates, the New York Stock Exchange still is slightly larger than the Tokyo stock exchange. But it may not remain so for long if the dizzying rally in Tokyo, which has boosted prices almost 50% over the past six months, continues unabated.    The Japanese market has risen dramatically in size and importance over the past few years as the country's trade surpluses have soared, leaving many domestic companies, financial institutions and small investors awash with cash. Capital International says that Japan has boosted its share of the total value of major world markets to 36.3% from 13.5% a decade ago. By comparison, the U.S. share has plunged to 36.1% of world market capitalization from 60.8% on March 31, 1977.    &quot;It's a reflection of the tremendous amount of liquidity in Japan,&quot; says Burton M. Siegel, chief investment officer at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. &quot;And with interest rates low, the stock market has given the Japanese investor far and away the best return compared with anything else, except perhaps real estate.&quot;    The yen's growing strength against the dollar also has helped the market, even though it has hurt many export-oriented Japanese companies, analysts say. The weak dollar has boosted Japanese market capitalization when denominated in dollars, and it also has made dollar investments, such as U.S. Treasury bills, less attractive for many Japanese institutions. &quot;Instead of buying overseas, they're now buying Japanese stocks,&quot; says George K. Hersh Jr., vice president of equity research at Daiwa Securities America Inc., a unit of Daiwa Securities Co., in New York.    Whether the U.S. can regain the No. 1 position is a matter of some contention.    Capital International, noting that Japan's market capitalization amounts to 129% of its gross national product, compared with around 63% in the U.S., says the ratio may not be sustainable in the long run. Some fund managers believe the Japanese market is chronically overvalued and faces a major correction soon. &quot;It's a speculative bubble, and I'm very concerned about it,&quot; says Gary Brinson, president of First Chicago Investment Advisers, a money manager. &quot;There's no breadth in the market at all. A small group of stocks is priced at levels that defy common sense.&quot;    Japanese stocks currently trade at an average of almost 56 times earnings, more than three times the multiple in the U.S., according to Capital International. Nomura Securities Co., for example, has a market value about four times that of American Express Co., while Nippon Telegraph andamp; Telephone Co. is valued at more than the entire West German stock market, Mr. Brinson says.    To be sure, not all stocks have rallied. While Japanese financial institutions, pharmaceutical and real estate companies have led the boom, many export-oriented companies, such as Sony Corp. and Toyota Motor Corp., have declined as the rising yen hurt profit.    If a correction occurs, the high level of liquidity available for investments &quot;leads us to believe that any setback for the market in general will only be short-lived,&quot; according to a recent report by Britain's Warburg Securities.    Moreover, some analysts contend that Japanese price-earnings ratios aren't watched as closely in Japan as in the U.S., with many companies sitting on huge assets that justify their high stock prices. </TEXT></DOC>
