After earlier enacting much tougher capital standards than Bushoriginally wanted to impose on the thrift industry, the 51-membercommittee today provided for more administration oversight of the$100 billion bailout.   The effort _ which will involve the largest disposition ofgovernment-owned property since the Louisiana Purchase _ will beoverseen by a new agency called the Resolution Trust Corp.   ``Even with the best of intentions, we'll still end up withabout 1,000 new Donald Trumps,'' said committee Chairman Henry B.Gonzalez, D-Texas, referring to the billionaire New York developer.``This has been an issue that has raised its head every time in abailout.''   Trump's acquisition of real estate through the governmentbailout of the Penn Central Railroad in the early 1970s sparked hisfinancial rise.   Bush had wanted a three-member board headed by TreasurySecretary Nicholas Brady and including Attorney General DickThornburgh and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan to run theResolution Trust Corp.   The Banking Committee expanded the board to include two morevoting members, Kemp and a real estate expert to be selected; plusone non-voting member, L. William Seidman, chairman of the FederalDeposit Insurance Corp., who will be in charge of the day-to-daytask of administering the cleanup.   Lawmakers said their chief aim is providing more administrativeoversight and expertise in an effort to thwart abuses that havecharacterized other bailouts. Putting Thornburgh on the board willhelp, they said.   For example, the Federal Asset Disposition Association, createdby the Federal Home Loan Bank Board to dispose of property thatfell into government hands from Sandamp;L failures in the early 1980s hasbeen plagued with accusations of inside dealing and politicalcroynyism.   ``There was a lot of talk about fraud, abuse and criminalactivity'' in the Sandamp;L industry, said Rep. Chalmers Wylie of Ohio,the ranking Republican on the Banking Committee. ``The attorneygeneral might be useful in finding some of that property that wasdisposed of in ways that were not all that kosher.''   After last week toughening Bush's proposed capital standards,the House panel on Monday beat bac{rw'' exemptions from capitalrequirements that have allowed many Sandamp;L owners to operate withlittle or no money of their own at risk.   Assistant Treasury Secretary David Mullins called Monday'saction ``another good day'' for the administration, praisingDemocrats on the panel for helping defeat ``accounting devices''offered primarily by young GOP lawmakers ``to water down'' whatBush wants.   However, the fight is not over. Rep. Claude Pepper, D-Fla., whoas chairman of the House Rules Committee has controlling influenceover what issues are revisited when a bill reaches the House floor,last week said in a letter he strongly supports continuation of the``good will'' exemptions.   According to industry and government records, at least 14 Sandamp;Lsin Florida with assets totaling $26 billion have little or nocapital other than ``good will.'' And half of them have a negativenet worth when ``good will'' is excluded from their balance sheets.   Meanwhile, Jesse Jackson spent more than two hours Mondaylobbying lawmakers on the 51-member committee for amendments hewants to make Sandamp;Ls and banks devote more of their lending tomortgages for low-income families and inner city redevelopment.   Specifically, Jackson wants to make banks and Sandamp;Ls publiclydisclose the race, gender and income levels of mortgage applicantsas a way of discouraging ``redlining'' discrimination.   And he is supporting an amendment by Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass.,that would require 15 percent to 20 percent of the residentialproperty that the government is inheriting as a result of Sandamp;Lfailures to be offered to local housing authorities at a discountedprice.   Bush's plan would raise an immediate $50 billion for the bailoutthrough the creation of an off-budget bond underwriter at anestimated cost to taxpayers of $200 billion to $250 billion overthe next 30 years.   ``This `Read my lips' slogan that he's adhering to is the mostcostly slogan in history,'' Jackson told reporters in a room thatthe committee set aside for his use. ``The Reagan-Bushadministration got us into trouble by disregarding their charge andmandate to regulate.''   The key vote Monday was on an amendment by Rep. Thomas Ridge,D-Pa., to give regulators authority to continue on a case-by-casebasis the so-called ``good will'' exemptions from cash tangiblecapital requirements that the committee had approved last week.   Ridge's amendment was defeated by a 28-23 vote after opponentscalled good will ``fake capital'' and said it is worthless as aresource.   ``We're trying to be tough and fair, and not just tough,'' saidRidge, who cited hundreds of Sandamp;Ls in Illinois, Pennsylvania, NewYork, New Jersey and Ohio that lost much of their tangible capitalin the early 1980s by taking over failed thrifts and absorbingtheir losses.   In exchange, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. _itself near insolvency _ granted those once-healthy Sandamp;Ls more than$20 billion in ``good will'' exemptions from normal capitalrequirements, lasting up to 40 years.   Under current accounting practices, that good will now accountsfor one-third of the industry's total capital of $60 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
