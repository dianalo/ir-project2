L. 97-300 (JTPA or the Act). Amendments to JTPA were enactedin the Job Training Partnership Act Amendments, Pub. L. 97-404 (December31, 1982); the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act, Pub. L. 98-524(October 19, 1984); the Job Training Partnership Act Amendments of 1986,Pub. L. 99-496 (October 16, 1986); and the Homeless Eligibility ClarificationAct, Title XI of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, Pub. L. 99-570 (October27, 1986). See also Section 713(b) of Pub. L. 99-159, National Science,Engineering, and Mathematics Authorization Act of 1986, which containstechnical amendments to the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act thatin turn amend JTPA. Final regulations promulgated by the Department of Labor to implement theprovisions of the Act were published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>at 48 FR 11078 (March 15, 1983); 48 FR 48753(October 20, 1983); 48 FR 49198 (October 24, 1983); and 48 FR 52438 (November18, 1983). See 20 CFR Parts 626-636 and 684. These regulations have been amended by <T4>Federal Register</T4> publication on two additional occasions: on April26, 1985, at 50 FR 16473, as corrected on June 13, 1985, at 50 FR 24764;and on August 29, 1986, at 51 FR 30856. The enactment of the Job TrainingPartnership Act Amendments of 1986 establishes the need for further modificationof the JTPA regulations to incorporate the revisions contained in the amendedlegislation. On January 16, 1987, an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) waspublished in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>as part of this rulemaking. 52 FR 1932. The ANPRinvited comments on the overall approach and actions proposed. Commentsreceived in response to the ANPR and ETA's discussion of those commentswere set out in the NPRM. 52 FR 23681 (June 24, 1987). The comments onthe ANPR were taken into consideration in development of the NPRM. <ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Comments on Proposed Rule </ITAG>Fourteen sets of comments were received in response to the NPRM. Sevenwere received from public interest groups, five from State-level agencies,and two from Private Industry Councils (PICs). The following is a summaryof the major comments received and DOL's response. Definitions The proposed rule would amend andSection; 626.4 to include a definition of``participant'' that had previously been issued administratively. One commentatorsuggested that ``participant'' be defined to include those persons engagingin ``pre-enrollment activity'', and specify that such activities constituteservices to which costs may be allocated among the various cost categories.The intent of the definition of ``participant'' is (1) to incorporate intothe regulations the definition that has been in use administratively, andwhich is contained in the reporting instructions; (2) to make clear thatcertain pre-enrollment activities, such as outreach, intake, and initialassessment, which may be provided to a large number of individuals, donot constitute participant status; and (3) to make clear that individualswho have started receiving employment, training, or services (except post-terminationservices) following intake are participants. No further change is beingmade to the definition of ``participant'' as proposed.State Incentive Grants The proposed regulation at andSection; 627.24 provides guidance for States'use of incentive grant funds. Two commentators questioned the need for the reference to andSection; 629.39(f)of the regulations, and stated that incentive grant funds received by theservice delivery area (SDA) for exemplary performance should have no specialrestrictions on their use beyond those imposed upon other JTPA funding.In addition, the commentators stated that only technical assistance fundsshould require special restrictions. The proposed rule at new andSection;629.39(f) implements JTPA section 202(b)(3)(B) which provides that fundswhich are used by the Governor or an SDA to develop a data collection systemto track the post-program experience of Title II-A participants are notsubject to the limitation on certain costs provisions of Section 108 ofthe Act for a period of not more than 2 program years (PYs). The amendatorylanguage, in conjunction with the Congressional Joint Explanatory Statementof Compromise (132 Cong. Rec. H 8809, October 1, 1986), defines the 2-yearperiod that applies to the amendments to JTPA. The Statement indicatedthat the amendments pertaining to the use of incentive grant funds areeffective retroactive to the beginning of PY 1986 (i.e., July 1, 1986).Thus, the 2-year exemption began on July 1, 1986, and ends on June 30,1988. The effect of the proposed rule at andSection; 629.39(f) is to providethe exemption and indicate that, after the 2-year period, the limitationon certain costs provisions of andSection; 629.39 are reinstated and applyonce again to technical assistance funds and incentive funds made availableto an SDA under section 202(b)(3) of JTPA. The proposed rule, however,inadvertently cited only paragraph (d) of andSection; 629.39 which refersto the exclusion of 6-percent funds used for technical assistance fromthe 70/30 minimum and maximum cost limitation provisions of andSection; 629.39(c)of the regulations. A correction is being made to andSection; 629.39(f) inthe final rule to indicate that after the 2-year period the provisionsof andSection; 629.39 (a) through (e) are reinstated and apply, as appropriate.One commentator questioned whether incentive funds made available to SDAscould be used for post-program followup after June 30, 1988. DOL does notbelieve that regulatory clarification is needed on this matter, since otherJTPA activities, including post-program followup, may be provided duringthe 2-year exemption period permitted for the development of post-programdata collection systems or after that time, subject to the provisions of20 CFR 629.39(c). In other words, costs attendant to post-program followupdata collection may be charged to incentive funds received by an SDA afterJune 30, 1988, so long as they are charged to administrative expendituresand are within the prescribed limits on administrative expenditures. Three commentators suggested changes to the proposed language at andSection;627.24(b), which precludes the expenditure of technical assistance fundsto support ongoing maintenance of management information systems or otheractivities that should be charged to the overall administration of JTPAprograms. All stated that the language in the proposed rule was ambiguousand too restrictive. The commentators suggested that the terms ``ongoingmaintenance of management information systems,'' ``overall administration,''and ``other activities'' should be clarified in the final regulations.Two of the commentators stated that the use of technical assistance fundsfor one-time projects or costs to upgrade information systems, train staff,and acquire additional hardware or software should be allowable, even ifnot directly associated with post program data collection activities. Theyargued that such activities provide added efficiency to the overall managementinformation system (MIS) which would have a positive impact on performance.The statutory amendments and Congressional Joint Explanatory Statementare clear on the use of technical assistance funds, in that ``technicalassistance'' means activities directly related to program performance,including ``preventative technical assistance.'' Further, the intent ofproviding for preventative technical assistance is to enable States toanticipate program deficiencies and take corrective action prior to thefailure of an SDA to meet the Secretary's performance standards. The Departmentconsiders the activities suggested by the commentators to be in the natureof ongoing operational support of MIS, not directly associated with post-programdata collection activities, and not ``technical assistance'' in the meaningof the statutory amendments and the Congressional Joint Explanatory Statement.No change is being made to the proposed language concerning ``ongoing maintenanceof management information systems.'' One of the commentators also suggestedthat the term ``overall administration'' was too broad and needed clarification.Similarly, another of the commentators expressed a like concern with respectto the term ``other activities.'' The intent of the proposed language isto provide added emphasis regarding the use of technical assistance funds.It is clear that the Congress does not intend that 6-percent technicalassistance funds be used to pay for costs which are associated with thenormal, day-to-day, overall administration of JTPA programs. DOL does agreethat the term ``other activities'' may be too general and is, therefore,adding language to andSection; 627.24(b) in the final rule to indicate thatthe limitation on the use of technical assistance funds applies to otheractivities that provide for the ongoing operational support of Title II-Aprograms. DOL is not including an exhaustive list of activities constitutingtechnical assistance, or costs considered ongoing operational support costsof JTPA Title II-A programs. These are matters appropriately under thepurview of the Governor pursuant to the provisions of andSection; 627.1 andthe Governor/Secretary Agreement, as well as the provisions of andSection;629.37 on allowable costs and andSection; 629.38 on classification of costs.Two commentators suggested that the final regulations should provide greaterflexibility for single statewide SDAs on the use of 6-percent funds, inparticular with respect to 6-percent funds used for technical assistancefunds. The commentators cited H.R. Rep. No. 99-754 on the House's bill(H.R. 5185, 99th Cong., 2d Sess.) to amend JTPA in support of their recommendations.The language contained in the House Committee's report indicates that,in the case of single statewide SDA States, technical assistance funds``may be used to improve program performance in general within the stateor to help in meeting program requirements such as the requirement to expendforty percent of funds on youth.'' The enacted legislation (Pub. L. 99-496)and the Congressional Joint Explanatory Statement does not include theHouse report language. They do indicate the purpose and intent of technicalassistance funds, making no exception for single statewide SDA States.The statutory amendments expand the use of funds for technical assistanceto permit such assistance to be provided to all SDAs, not just to SDAswhich fail to meet the Secretary of Labor's performance standards. TheCongressional Joint Explanatory Statement also clarifies that technicalassistance means activities directly related to program performance. Thelegislative change was enacted to enable States to anticipate deficienciesand take corrective action prior to failure to meet performance standards.Where the House report is expansive in the uses of technical assistancefunds, the joint statement is more focused and clear on the use of suchfunds. DOL agrees that single statewide SDA States do have flexibilityto develop policies and the methodology for distributing 6-percent incentivefunds to subrecipients. It does not follow, however, that such States havethe authority to use technical assistance funds to undertake activitieswhich would not be permissible in multi-SDA States. The provisions on theuse of technical assistance funds apply equally to single statewide SDAStates and multi-SDA States alike. No change is being made to the proposedregulation. Statewide SDA Plan Submission The proposed regulation at andSection; 628.6 provides that when the SDA isthe State, the Governor shall submit to the Secretary a 2-program-yearjob training plan. Two commentators asked that the current language containedin this section regarding approximate plan/modification submission datesbe retained. The Department agrees that existing language within andSection;628.6(a) adequately addresses the matter of statewide plan/modificationsubmission dates and that portion of andSection; 628.6(a) is being retainedin the final rule. In addition, the final rule also retains that portionof the language in andSection; 628.6(b) stipulating that a plan will be consideredapproved, unless within 30 days the Secretary notifies the Governor otherwisein writing. Credit for 14- and 15-Year Olds Toward 40-Percent Youth Requirement One commentator requested that funds expended on youth ages 14 and 15 enrolledunder any portion of JTPA Title II-A be used to meet the 40-percent expenditurerequirement for youth. The Act, as amended, is explicit in that only individuals14- and 15-years old enrolled in pre-employment skills training pursuantto JTPA Section 205(c)(1) may be included in meeting the 40-percent requirement.Therefore, no change is being made to the proposed regulatory additionto andSection; 630.1(b)(1). Summer Youth Employment Training Program (SYETP) At andSection; 630.2, the proposed regulations specify the instructions andschedules to be used by the Governor to ensure that each SDA has a SummerYouth Employment and Training Program (SYETP) plan which includes assessment,description of program activities, and written program goals and objectives.Two commentators suggested that the proposed rule clarify that the SYETPunder Title II-B be included under JTPA, the SDA's JTPA Title II-A jobtraining plan. DOL does not believe that this is something that should be prescribed inthe regulations given the nature of Title II-B summer programs. A Statemay wish to provide for a separate planning cycle for SYETP programs (e.g.,annual) to respond to fluctuations in funding levels or other changes thatmay occur from one year to another. States may provide for the Title II-BSYETP plan to be included as part of the SDAs Title II-A job training plans,but there is no requirement that they do so. No change is being made inthe final rule. A comment was received that andSection; 630.2 should be revised to permitflexibility in the assessment of Title II-B participants and should authorizeuse of a sampling methodology. Assessment of SYETP participants does notrequire that new tests or tests separate from local educational agenciesbe conducted, since existing information and data may be used. The useof sampling methodology is not consistent with the intent of the amendedAct which provides for assessment of reading and mathematics skill levelsof eligible participants. The objective is to determine an individual'sneeds and respond to them. Sampling does not permit that. One commentator suggested that in andSection; 630.2(c)(3) language shouldbe added to make clear that the SYETP must include a description of evaluationcriteria and procedures used to evaluate the effectiveness of SYETP programs.DOL believes this is a constructive suggestion that is consistent withthe statutory amendments and, therefore, the final rule is revised accordingly.Also, andSection; 630.2(c)(2) is being amended as a result of comments toprovide that the SYETP plan will, based on the assessment of reading andmathematics skill levels of eligible participants, describe SDA basic andremedial education programs which enhance the basic education skills ofyouth. One commentator suggested that the SYETP plan should contain an expenditureplan and demonstrate that the SDA will expend at least 90 percent of thetotal funds available. The amended legislation does not provide authorityfor DOL to establish such a requirement. DOL believes that such mattersshould appropriately be determined by the Governor pursuant to the provisionsof 20 CFR 627.1 and the Governor/Secretary Agreement.Identification of Dislocated Workers Two commentators noted that the phrase ``or who have received a noticeof termination or lay-off'' is missing in andSection; 631.30(a)(1) of theproposed regulations, which is inconsistent with the provisions of JTPASection 302(a)(1). The exclusion of this phrase in the proposed regulationwas an inadvertent omission and was not intended to indicate any changein the statutory provisions of JTPA Section 302(a)(1). The missing phraseis restored in the final regulation at andSection; 631.30(a)(1). Two commentators recommended that the word ``failure'' be deleted fromproposed regulations at andSection; 631.30(b)(2) (iv) and (v) pertainingto the identification of self-employed farmers and others to be eligibleto participate in dislocated worker programs under JTPA Title III. It wassuggested that the term ``failure'' was too broad and could include personswho, regardless of ability, fail or refuse to make payments or obtain capitaland, as such, they should not be eligible for services. The Departmentagrees that the term ``failure'' is too broad, and that it is really theinability to make payments on loans or to obtain capital that is key inidentifying individuals eligible for Title III services under andSection;631.30(b)(2) (iv) and (v). The term ``failure'' is being deleted from theproposed provisions of andSection; 631.30(b)(2) (iv) and (v) in the finalrule. In addition, one commentator suggested that the regulations provide clarificationin andSection; 631.30(a)(4)(i) with respect to individuals who become unemployeddue to natural disasters or as a result of general economic conditionsin ``the community in which they reside,'' since not all business peoplenecessarily live in the community in which their businesses are located.The proposed regulation at andSection; 631.30(a), as in the existing regulation,provides that the Governor is authorized to establish procedures to identifysubstantial groups of eligible individuals for JTPA Title III based onthe criteria contained in the regulations. The language in the proposedregulation is intended to be illustrative rather than limiting and Governorsmay, pursuant to the provisions of andSection; 627.1 and the Governor/SecretaryAgreement, establish definitions, guidelines, and interpretations whichreflect and respond to local conditions. DOL believes that the languagecontained in the proposed regulations accurately reflects congressionalintent on this matter. No change has been made to the proposed provisionsof andSection; 631.30(a)(4)(i) in the final rule. Technical Corrections and Other Clarifying Rules On occasion over the past four years, by separate <T4>Federal Register </T4>notices, the Department has announced changesin the implementation of JTPA. These changes have been largely necessitatedby provisions of other Federal statutes that contain requirements thatamended JTPA or applied to programs under JTPA. Other JTPA clarifying noticeshave also been published. The Department is taking this opportunity toincorporate some of these previously published changes and interpretations(in addition to those included in the proposed rule) into the basic JTPATitles I, II, and III regulations. The following is a summary of the incorporated changes: In Part 631, Subpart B of the existing regulations the terms ``allotment''and ``allocation,'' and their variations, are used interchangeably. Theproper term is ``allotment,'' and its variations, which conforms to theAct. Accordingly, the final rule contains technical corrections to nomenclatureat Part 631, Subpart B to reflect the proper term. Other minor changes to reflect current nomenclature and citations alsoare made in various sections of the regulations. Freely Associated States and Republic of Palau Pursuant to the Compact of Free Association Act, Pub. L. 99-239 (Janaury14, 1986), the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Federated Statesof Micronesia, formerly trust territories, are now freely associated states(FASs). However, the Republic of Palau currently remains a trust territory.See Pub. L. 99-658 (November 14, 1986). Therefore, in the final rule anomenclature change has been made in andSection; 631.11(b). The referenceto the ``Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands'' has been revised to referto ``the Republic of Palau/Trust Territory, the Federated States of Micronesia,and the Republic of the Marshall Islands * * * .'' These three entitiesare eligible for proportional allotments of the allotment which would havegone to the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands had the Compact notexisted. Republication of JTPA Titles I, II, and III Regulations The proposed rule set forth individual proposed amendments to the JTPAregulations. However, to provide a single, complete source for these regulations,the final rule is publishing the entire set of JTPA Titles I, II, and IIIregulations, as revised. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Impact </ITAG>The final rule implements the Job Training Partnership Act Amendments of1986, makes technical changes, and clarifies existing regulations to reflectcontinuing policies. It does not have the financial or other impact tomake it a major rule and, therefore, the preparation of a regulatory impactanalysis is not necessary. See Executive Order No. 12291, 3 CFR, 1981 Comp.,p. 127, 5 U.S.C. 601 note. At the time the NPRM was published, the Department of Labor notified theChief Counsel for Advocacy, Small Business Administration, and made thecertification pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act at 5 U.S.C. 605(b),that the rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. No significant economic impact would be imposedby the rule. <ITAG tagnum="84">Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Numbers </ITAG>These programs are listed in the <T3>Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance </T3>at No. 17.246, ``Employmentand Training Assistance_Dislocated Workers'' (JTPA, Title III, Programs);and No. 17.250, ``Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA)'' (JTPA, Titles Iand II, Programs). <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 20 CFR Parts 626 Through 631 </ITAG>Grant programs, Labor, Manpower training programs. <ITAG tagnum="84">Final Rule </ITAG>Accordingly, 20 CFR Chapter V is amended as follows:1.
