It follows from experimentaldata that the rate of N/sub 2/O/sub 4/ formation reduces with the increaseof partial pressure of oxygen or decrease of partial pressure of nitrogenoxide. The same regularity is seen for the rate of nitrogen formation.The rate constants of N/sub 2/O formation in dissociating nitrogen tetroxidewith oxygen or nitrogen oxide additions agree satisfactorily with previouslypublished results, obtained in stoichiometric mixtures. The appreciablediscrepancy at 520 deg C is bind with considerable degree of nitrogenoxide transformation which constitutes approximately 14%. It is determinedthat the kinetics of formation of the products of irreversible N/sub2/O and N/sub 2/ decomposition in stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric2NO/sub 2/ reversible 2NO+O/sub 2/ mixtures is described by identical3NO -andgt; N/sub 2/O+NO/sub 2/ and N/sub 2/O+NO -andgt; N/sub 2/+NO/sub 2/ reactions.</TEXT></DOC>
