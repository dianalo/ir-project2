Clarkson, Boeing's senior vice president forgovernment and international affairs. &quot;Depending on who youcan believe,&quot; he adds, the decision will be made &quot;in the nextcouple of weeks. This has been portrayed as the final bell.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Gareth C.C. Chang, president of McDonnell Douglas Pacificandamp; Asia Ltd., also believes the decision will come this month.But he cautions that Beijing probably won't announce itspreference; it simply will begin months of in-depthnegotiations with the frontrunner. &quot;Until {the chosencompany} signs on the dotted line, things could change,&quot; hesays. &quot;You don't close the deal until the ink is dry.&quot;   Because of the importance of the contract to China'sairlines and its aerospace sector, the choice will rest withthe powerful State Planning Commission, and ultimately withPremier Li Peng, both companies say.   The top-level decision also is necessitated by internalpolitical conflict. The Ministry of Aeronautics andAstronautics Industry, which looks after China's farflungaerospace and engine factories, wants a project that willprovide it with the most work and technology transfer. Butthe Civil Aviation Administration of China, overseer of theairline industry, wants the most economical, versatileaircraft.   Even the contestants concede that there is a rift inBeijing. The upshot is that the CAAC is smitten with Boeing,while the aeronautics people favor McDonnell Douglas, whichalready co-produces MD-82 jetliners in Shanghai. &quot;Right nowthere is open warfare on the Chinese side,&quot; says a Westerndiplomat in Beijing.   A spokesman for the aeronautics ministry confirms that &quot;adecision will come soon&quot; and that senior officials are&quot;actively studying&quot; the bids. He declines to elaborate.   At stake for the Western companies are aircraft and enginesales contracts valued at more than $4.5 billion. While thatdoesn't qualify as a &quot;mega-order,&quot; both sides say it would beone of their larger contracts for 1991. More importantly, thewinner probably would stand to garner future orders forwide-bodied jetliners and bigger engines.   Boeing is pitching its popular twin-engined 737-300 model,equipped with engines by CFM International Inc., a 50-50joint venture of General Electric Co. of the U.S. and Snecmaof France. McDonnell Douglas is offering its MD-90 twin-jetwith engines from International Aero Engines AG, afive-company consortium led by United Technologies Corp.'sPratt andamp; Whitney Division and Rolls-Royce PLC.   The contract would require the CAAC, and the regionalairlines that have sprung up under its umbrella in recentyears, to take all 150 airplanes. It also would establish aco-production program that would involve a host of Chineseaerospace factories eager to enhance their prowess inaerospace technology.   The Western jetliner company would let the Chinese buildnearly the entire plane and would provide managerial supportand a team of 200 to 300 engineers and production experts.But the Chinese would have to pay for their own tools,machines, factories and materials.   To help Beijing offset those costs, Boeing or McDonnellDouglas would commit to buy extra jetliner parts built by theChinese for use in the company's own production lines. TheChinese also are being offered work on future programs. Theengine makers have made similar offers.   The four-year battle for the contract is being fought hardbecause China is &quot;the last unsaturated market forforeign-manufactured aircraft,&quot; according to an analysis bythe U.S. Embassy in Beijing.   But victory will have its price. &quot;You'd need to build 500{planes} to make money&quot; on the project, asserts Jim Eckes,director of Hong Kong consultancy Indoswiss Aviation. But headds that the contract would help the winner &quot;keep the bulkof the China market in its hands.&quot;   Boeing, which is the brand leader in China with 61 of itsplanes flying and 85 on order or option, has never builtplanes outside the U.S. Mr. Clarkson acknowledges that theproject is risky and that &quot;there is no way to be economicalon a production run of 150&quot; planes. But he says Boeingwouldn't lose money overall because it would use more partsin China, where labor is cheap.   McDonnell Douglas, whose MD-82 project in Shanghai ends in1994, also vows it wouldn't lose money if it wins thecontract. Indeed, the defense contractor is pledging to takethe co-production into an equity joint venture and to buy 50%of specified aircraft parts the Chinese produce at fiveplants.   Both Boeing and McDonnell Douglas hope that productionwill begin in 1995, with the first airplanes delivered inlate 1996 or early 1997. The production run would last forabout 10 years. Under the agreement, however, the 150airplanes destined for the CAAC and its affiliates would betreated as if they had been built and delivered by theWestern partner, which would bear the responsibility ofhonoring warranties and providing after-sales support to theChinese customers.   On the surface, it would appear that McDonnell Douglas hasa leg up in the contest. The company has been working withthe Chinese aerospace industry since 1979, and Chinacurrently builds 11 airframe components for McDonnellDouglas. Since 1985, the Shanghai Aircraft Industrial Corp.has been doing final assembly of MD-82 twin-jets inpartnership with McDonnell Douglas. The 20 planes built sofar, out of a planned 45, are flown by China EasternAirlines, based in Shanghai, and China Northern Airlines,based in Shenyang.   &quot;Shanghai already has invested for the MD-82,&quot; saysMcDonnell Douglas's Mr. Chang. &quot;The investment for the MD-90is small.&quot; The two models are quite similar; in fact thebiggest differences is the number of seats and the enginesused. The bulk of the investment needed would be to preparethe Shanghai aerospace factory and another in Chengdu tobuild fuselage sections and wings, Mr. Chang says --something that probably would cost $100 million to $200million. But he says the Chinese have the money for that.   Mr. Chang points out that the Shanghai factory has beenturning out whole airplanes for six years. If Boeing wins thecontest, he asserts, it would need six years to achieve thesame expertise.   But McDonnell Douglas is far from a shoo-in. The Chineseknow that the company has financial difficulties elsewhere.Its MD-11 wide-body is behind in the delivery schedule andisn't meeting performance standards, and world demand foraircraft from its MD-80 and MD-90 series is softening.International Aero Engines' V2500 model, which would go onthe MD-90s, normally is mounted on the wing. This would beone of the first instances in which the engine goes on thefuselage. The MD-90 also would require sturdier landing gearto serve many of China's often decrepit runways.   Finally, those watching the situation maintain, the CAACand its affiliates don't want McDonnell Douglas planes. Asidefrom the Shanghai-built MD-82s, China has ordered only fiveother planes from the company. (Airbus Industrie is doing alittle better. The European jetliner consortium has placed 15aircraft in China and has received firm orders for ninemore.)   &quot;We have a much more established relation with theairlines,&quot; says Boeing's Mr. Clarkson. &quot;That's why you hearthat the CAAC favors us and the aeronautics ministry favorsMcDonnell Douglas.&quot; He says Boeing was told that McDonnellDouglas's Shanghai project &quot;was not a deciding factor&quot; inthis contest. The company also sources parts in China, asdoes engine-builder GE.   In what appears to be the final heat of the race, bothsides are putting on the pressure. Boeing officials met lastOctober with Premier Li, and McDonnell Douglas sent itschairman to see the Chinese leader earlier this month. Boeingand its engine supplier, CFM, had a delegation in Beijinglast weekend to &quot;clarify&quot; their respective offers.   ---   James McGregor contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
