The executed men were among an estimated 2,000 people arrestedin house-to-house searches after the disturbances one week ago inthe Somali capital, Mogadishu, said the human rights group, AfricaWatch.   The group said the men were rounded up two days after theunrest, taken to a beach just outside Mogadishu, and shot to death.   Africa Watch and other sources put the number killed during theJuly 14 violence at around 400. Somalia's government previouslysaid 23 people died and 59 were injured in the unrest, which itblamed on ``troublemakers.''   Africa Watch and the other sources said many of those who wereslain died when military vehicles armed with .50-caliber machineguns opened fire on houses in heavily populated residentialdistricts.   The human rights group said more than 1,000 people were injured.   Africa Watch, with offices in London and Washington, releasedits statement in Nairobi. The independent sources spoke oncondition of anonymity for fear of government reprisals.   Mogadishu residents contacted by telephone said that aside fromisolated gunfire that continued a day after the riots, there hadbeen no further violence in Mogadishu.   Africa Watch and the independent sources said the violence brokeout after the July 13 arrests of four Moslem leaders and anunspecified number of civilians. They said armed detachmentssurrounded Mogadishu's major mosques in anticipation of protestsand tried to disperse worshipers as they left the mosques followingprayers.   Soldiers then opened fire on the worshipers, who fought backmainly with rocks and stones, the human rights group said. In atleast one neighborhood, worshipers who outnumbered security forcesseized their weapons and returned fire, the rights group said.   The army moved into the city with tanks and took over majorgovernment buildings and stategic roads, according to Africa Watch.   Witnesses reached by telephone said that at one point a mobscreaming ``Allahu Akbar!'' Arabic for God is great, made logroadblocks to stop military vehicles mounted with machine guns andfiring at random in city streets.   Throughout that evening and the next night, soldiers went fromhouse to house arresting men, raping women and looting property,witnesses said.   The violence also appeared linked to the slaying of Mogadishu'sRoman Catholic Bishop, Salvatore Colombo, on July 9 by anunidentified gunman. The bishop was an Italian citizen who hadlived in Somalia for more than 40 years.   Africa Watch reported widespread suspicion in Mogadishu thatColombo's death was ordered by government forces who suspected himof relaying information about human rights abuses to foreigngovernments.   Moslem leaders are said to have been angry the governmentoffered a $13,000 reward for information about his killing becausethey felt officials generally showed little concern for the welfareof Somalis, Africa Watch reported.   Some residents reported a recent upsurge in anti-Christian andanti-white feeling in the capital and said Colombo was suspected oftrying to convert Moslem youth.   The reports were difficult to verify because the government hasbarred journalists from visiting Somalia since heavy fighting brokeout between government forces and the northern rebel SomaliNational Movement in May 1988.   Islam is the state religion in the poor, pastoral East Africannation of 6 million. There are about 2,000 Catholics.   The autocratic President Mohamed Siad Barre has ruled Somalia asa one-party state since 1969.</TEXT></DOC>
