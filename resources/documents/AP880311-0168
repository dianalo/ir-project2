WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A group of U.S. senators told Mikhail S. Gorbachevon Friday that Soviet superiority in tanks and artillery scared theWest into a nuclear defense, so cutbacks in those arms shouldprecede strategic missile reductions.   The senators said they sensed the Soviet leader is less worriedabout President Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, but theysaid they doubted that signaled greater tolerance of it.   ``I think there has been a lessening of Soviet apprehensionabout SDI,'' said Sen. Sam Nunn, chairman of the Senate ArmedServices Committee. ``I think they recognize that it is a long-termproject.''   The senators met with reporters after a weeklong exchange withhigh-level Soviet military and political officials.   The Kremlin wants to link a superpower agreement on reduction ofstrategic weapons to compliance with the 1972 Anti-BallisticMissile treaty. The treaty outlaws space-based defense systems likethat seen under SDI, popularly known as the ``Star Wars'' program.   Nunn said the Americans pressed for ``delinkage'' of the twoissues, but they ``did not get any encouragement at all along thatline.''   The official news agency Tass, in its account of the meeting,said Gorbachev reiterated the Kremlin's ``allegiance to itsposition on a direct linkage'' of missiles cuts with ABM compliance.   ``Violating it destroys the entire machinery of the agreement,''Tass quoted Gorbachev as saying. ``We shall never be able to bridlethe rabid charger of the arms race if it is let loose in outerspace.''   Gorbachev and Reagan signed an agreement eliminating allmedium-range nuclear weapons at their Washington summit in December.   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., said he assured Gorbachev that thetreaty was likely to be ratified this spring ``with no cripplingamendments'' and that the concern of the Congress andadministration had turned to the issue of how to cut strategic, orlong-range nuclear arms.   U.S. and Soviet negotiators are at work in Geneva on a proposedtreaty to eliminate 50 percent of the superpowers' long-range, orintercontintal nuclear missiles.   Both sides have said they would like the treaty ready forsigning in late May or early June when Reagan visits Moscow, butthe senators expressed doubt it would be ready in time.   Nunn said the Kremlin should first cut its overwhelmingsuperiority in conventional weaponry such as tanks and artillery.   ``There is a great correlation between our first-use reliance onnuclear weapons and their massive conventional forces,'' Nunn said.   He said he explained to Gorbachev during the group's meeting,which lasted more than three hours, that a Soviet rollback of tanksand artillery from Eastern Europe would go far in reducing thefears of America's European allies about a Soviet military threat.   The North Atlantic Treaty Organization nations, which will losetheir medium-range missiles under the agreement signed in December,have balked at further nuclear cuts without prior reductions inSoviet conventional arms.   ``We would like to see the Soviet Union save some money so itcan devote it to their economic development,'' Nunn said he toldGorbachev.   The Senate group, which also included Sens. William Cohen,R-Maine, Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., and Carl Levin, D-Mich., also met inthe past week with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze,Communist Party foreign affairs secretary Anatoly F. Dobrynin andArmy Chief of Staff Sergei F. Akhromeyev.</TEXT></DOC>
