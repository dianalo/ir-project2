Board of Insurance.andO;Feature:   illustrationphotograph.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Escape From The Paper PitandM;Two years ago, the Texas State Board of Insurance (TSBI) in Austin was boggeddown in a paper quagmire.andP;  At last count, the agency had piled up over 50million pieces of paper, making it one of the most paper-intensive operationsin Texas.andP;  Contributing to that pile were sundry information systems schemesthat had actually done nothing to reduce the agency's paper problem.andP;  Miredin the middle between multiple sources of information--some heavilyautomated, others entirely paper-based--TSBI users were sinking deeper anddeeper into a bottomless processing pit.andM;To pull them out, TSBI management decided in the spring of 1988 to devise aninformation management strategy that would enable users to access informationdrawn from multiple sources at individual workstations.andP;  Integration of workflow, processes and information sources was the goal of the planners at theTSBI, the chief insurance industry regulator in the state of Texas.andP;  It wasalso determined that imaging technology would be intrinsic to this integratedwork solution.andM;Currently, a mixture of IBM PCs and compatibles connected to the TSBI's IBM3081D mainframe are used for accessing central applications, using 3270terminal emulation.andP;  Less than 5% of the PCs, which are also used for simpleword-processing and spreadsheet chores, are connected into local areanetworks (LANs).andP;  Inactive files at the TSBI are accessed through microfilmreader/printers, and current information is still kept in paper files.andP;  Evenin the more progressive IS pockets of the organization, TSBI users continueto resort to paper for most of their information needs.andM;Trapped the deepest in this paper pit are TSBI staffers administering therules and regulations at the Workers' Compensation Division.andP;  Saddled withover 150,000 folders containing some 5 million pages of information, thedivision has been relying on these paper documents for performing 95% of itspolicy review and rate-making responsibilities.andM;During the decade between 1977 and 1987, that review process had steadilyslowed, as the division became increasingly bogged down in paperwork.andP;  Duringthat time, the division's ability to audit information for workers'compensation insurance policies decreased by a dramatic 50%.andP;  A subsequentprobe into the problem revealed the reason for the decline in performance.andM;It was discovered that during the decade the amount of incoming mail to thedivision had spurted 50%, but there had been no hiring done to accommodatethis increase.andP;  The division's auditing and rating staff had to absorb theadditional clerical workload.andP;  And absorb it they did; by 1988, auditors werespending up to 60% of their time on such clerical functions as organizing andpurging files.andM;So in 1988, the Workers' Compensation Division was aptly chosen as a goodtestbed for developing the TSBI's integrated work solution.andP;  TSBI plannerswanted this solution to address more than just the division's clericalproblems.andP;  By melding the division's many information sources, they hoped tostreamline and speed up the regulatory and administrative work of thedepartment, as well.andM;Under the first phase of the project currently under way, the agency haschosen to implement an image-processing network as the user platform.andP;  Theinitial image-processing network envisioned by the TSBI has to satisfy amyriad of complex requirements, encompassing everything from simple documentscanning and indexing all the way through to token-ring LAN connectivity.andO;The complexity stems from the sheer number of the division's files and thecomplicated nature of the functions performed with these files.andM;All in all, the TSBI effort is a decidedly ambitious undertaking, since theresulting system would be called on to tackle one of the highest transactionvolumes that an imaging system had ever attempted.andP;  In addition to capturingand filing more than 30,000 pages per day, the system also has to retrieveand route another 15,000 pages daily.andM;With such heavy requirements, it became apparent that simple, garden-varietyLANs and workstations would not be able to cut it technologically.andO;Intimidated by the daunting requirements of the TSBI system, some vendorsshied away from the project.andP;  But not Image Business Systems Corp. (IBS) ofNew York City, which won the $1.8 million image-processing contract from theTexas insurance authority in September 1988.andM;Under that contract, IBS acted as a systems integrator, supplying the TSBIwith the requisite hardware and software, including its own Imagesystemsoftware.andP;  At the heart of the image-processing system is a ProNet-80fiber-optic backbone LAN from Westborough, Mass.-based Proteon Inc. Routersconnect nine Ethernet LANs to the token-passing ProNet-80.andP;  Linked directlyto this backbone is the Workers' Compensation Division's Sun 4/260 reducedinstruction set computing (RISC)-based machine from Sun Microsystems Inc.,andO;which operates as the central server for the system.andM;The Sun 4/260 is part of what the TSBI calls the &quot;central station,&quot; whichalso includes a series 1800 optical disk-handling system from Cygnet SystemsInc. of San Jose and four optical drives from Laser Magnetic StorageInternational Co. of Colorado Springs.andP;  The central station is one of sixstations in the system configuration.andP;  The others are a scan station, animage station, a print station, a device station and an OCR station.andM;The scan station consists of three Improvision Pags 1000 scanners, along withthree AST Premium 386 PCs from AST Research Inc. of Irvine, Calif.andO;Fifty-five high-resolution monitors attached to an equal number of IBM PS/2model 70s are used in the image station.andM;Three Laserjet II laser printers from Hewlett-Packard Co. and threeMitsubishi Corp. 386s are part of the print station.andP;  The device stationincludes two AST PCs and a facsimile board for receiving faxed images overtelephone lines and entering them into the system.andP;  The OCR station, whichalso has two AST PCs, includes a Calera 9000 OCR server.andM;The high-resolution displays provide users with a windowed environment for3081D mainframe activity, image processing, word processing and tables andcalculator functions.andP;  These mouse-controlled functions can be easily taughtto users.andM;Files can be routed according to document type either on demand or byautomated queuing.andP;  They can also be simultaneously retrieved for display bymore than one user at a time.andP;  To avoid duplication, only one user at a timecan update the file.andM;Incoming mail, as well as existing files, can be converted to images in thesystem.andP;  Documens are batched, and bar code sheets are used to indicatemultipage documents, batches, contrast changes or specific queues.andP;  Batchesare sent to a particular clerk's in-box, where each document is reviewed forimage quality.andP;  After that, the document is added to the appropriate existingfile.andM;File information can be updated from data actually in the document itself.andO;Once a document is classified according to a type table, a set of data fieldsspecific to that document type appears on the screen that's attached to thePS/2s at the image stations.andP;  Data entered into these fields identify adocument for retrieval, reporting and purging.andM;When incoming mail is indexed by file category in the Workers' CompensationDivision, the system will instigate a set of procedures that retrieve relatedfiles during nonpeak hours.andP;  This minimizes the load placed on the opticaldisk-handling system during the working day.andM;The burden on this system is also eased by having other documents that weregenerated during the day scanned during nonpeak hours, when they can then bemore efficiently written to disk.andP;  To reduce retrieval time, the systemallows a file's contents to be written to only one side of a disk.andM;Word-processing capabilities will be integrated into the TSBI's imageprocessing, allowing users to access form letters or even particularparagraphs or free-form text contained in those letters.andP;  The system is alsoslated to incorporate other special features that users will undoubtedly findhelpful.andP;  For example, letter generation will be linked to a suspense system,which will send the file back to the sender when a response is received orwhen there is no response after a predetermined period of time.andM;In addition to automating the clerical environment, the image-processingsystem will also help the Workers' Compensation Division automate the work ofthe department.andP;  For instance, division staffers will be able to monitorinsurance industry activity via reports that are generated from thedocuments.andP;  A subsystem currently under development will also enable staffersto track insurance companies' compliance to a state regulation requiring themto submit statistical loss data.andM;All of the basic and additional advantages of the new image-processing systemare expected to accrue once it becomes fully operational sometime during thefourth quarter of this year.andP;  This summer, the system will be extended toanother TSBI division to automate insurance agent license renewals.andM;Despite the extensive benefits anticipated, image processing will not solveall of the TSBI's information problems.andP;  In some cases, it actually hascreated new ones in terms of managing decentralized systems and multivendornetworks.andP;  It has also proved to be especially challenging since the TSBI didnot have in-house IS personnel knowledgeable in this emerging technologyfield.andM;That knowledge base, however, should expand as the agency gets moreexperience with image processing.andP;  It's already clear that this technologyhas refocused the strategic direction of information systems at the TSBI.andO;But the focus has not been dictated by technology.andP;  It has been dictated bythe need to apply work solutions to actual work problems.andM;Nancy Hollen Black is a member of the project team that is implementing theTexas State Board of Insurance's image-processing system.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
