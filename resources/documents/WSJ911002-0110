Lastmonth, the commission recommended the Governor be prosecutedon felony charges of using his office for personal gain.   Governor Hunt denies he violated the law and points to twoprevious Ethics Commission advisory opinions which statedthat the state Legislature had &quot;not seen fit to place anyrestrictions on the use of a State aircraft by the Governorand his family.&quot; As an ordained minister in the PrimitiveBaptist Church he has delivered sermons for 33 years. Stillhe has written the state a check for $9,724, the sum total ofall the donations he collected after 18 sermons. But thatdidn't satisfy the commission, which held there was reason tobelieve the Governor &quot;knowingly and willfully&quot; used hisposition for financial gain.</LP><TEXT>   Governor Hunt isn't a typical public official. Asmall-business man, he was elected Alabama's first RepublicanGovernor in 1986 after a Democratic Party civil war. His onlyprevious office was that of county probate judge. Many peopleexpected this political novice to fall flat on his face.   He didn't. He compiled a respectable record, held taxesdown and attracted new business. Last year, he confounded thepundits and won narrow re-election by defeating the head ofthe state's teachers union.   It's no secret that Governor Hunt has made powerfulpolitical enemies, especially in organized labor. The mainethics complaint against him was filed by a lobbyist for thecoal miners union. Rather than send the case to a local DA,the Ethics Commission has referred it to the Democraticattorney general, who will decide whether to prosecute.   American politics has recently seen many examples ofpublic officials being hounded from office on dubious ethicscharges. It has become another way of disposing ofpoliticians who couldn't be defeated at the ballot box. Nodoubt Governor Hunt should not have continued to acceptdonations for his preaching once he took office. He onlyfueled the controversy by arrogantly dismissing questionsabout the donations; he apologized for an error in judgmentonly this week. But there is no evidence the people ofAlabama want to void last year's election and turn Mr. Huntout of office.   Mr. Hunt isn't the only state executive who deserves afair hearing. Oklahoma's Democratic Governor David Walters isbeing investigated on charges that his campaign offered statejobs in return for campaign contributions. If direct promiseswere made there are indeed genuine legal concerns, but careshould be taken so that foolish discussions bestcharacterized as stupid, rather than illegal, aren'tcriminalized.   To remove a sitting Governor because he accepted a fewhundred dollars on occasion to promote spiritual valuesstrikes us as absurd. Until this year, Members of Congressfrequently padded their salaries by using corporate jets todeliver brief, canned remarks to lobbying groups. And whilethe Alabama Ethics Commission carefully tallies GovernorHunt's collection-plate money, the Senate Ethics Committeestill can't bring itself to discipline Senator Alan Cranstonfor his role as a ringleader of the Keating Five. When ethicsis allowed to become a political weapon, there is no limit tothe hypocrisy with which the rules are enforced.</TEXT></DOC>
