According to State Department officials, auditorsdiscovered that U.S. arms can easily be diverted to thirdcountries, in part because department officials haven'testablished procedures to prevent such unauthorized sales.</LP><TEXT>   Officials said that auditors for the inspector general,Sherman Funk, also concluded that the State Departmentdoesn't have sufficient resources to police exports and that,in some cases, officials in overseas posts don't want to beresponsible for checking up on arms transactions.   Mr. Funk is expected to recommend in a public report thatapplicants for U.S.-origin arms be checked more carefully andthat department licensing officials step up efforts to verifyhow exported items are put to use, officials said.   &quot;We are sitting on our hands while, at the same time,we're complaining that other countries are not controllingtheir military and technology exports,&quot; said a senior StateDepartment official.   Mr. Funk's public report is to be released this month.Classified information detailing Israel's activities, as wellas problems involving exports to several other countries,will be made available to Secretary of State James Baker andleaders on Capitol Hill.   By far the most interest in Mr. Funk's report concerns hisfindings on Israel. Mr. Funk has amassed formidable evidencefrom U.S. intelligence reports indicating that Israelre-exported weaponry and technology without first obtainingWashington's approval for the sales, as the U.S. requires.   Officials who have reviewed intelligence reports said theresales included air-to-air missiles to China, anti-tankmissiles to South Africa, and cluster bombs to Ethiopia andChile, as well as sophisticated electronic equipment.   After disclosure of the Funk inquiry, the Israeli Embassysaid in a statement Friday that the government adheresstrictly to U.S. procurement and technology-transferregulations. But at the same time, the statement said thatnews reports about unauthorized sales &quot;are sensitive matterswhich are subject to negotiation&quot; between the U.S. andIsrael.   Senior officials of the State Department and the Pentagonwill meet this week with Israeli government and industryofficials in Tel Aviv to discuss U.S. licensing requirements.   Officials said the U.S., for one thing, wants Israel tospecify more clearly what use is being made of U.S. partsobtained under export licenses. In some cases, the so-calledend-use is described as military research and development,without specifying the type of weapons system, U.S. officialssaid.   Export licenses for items on the U.S. Munitions List areissued by the State's Department's Office of Defense TradeControls. That office is responsible for enforcing exportlaws, but Mr. Funk's auditors found that, along with othersin the State Department, the office repeatedly has failed todetect unauthorized arms diversions.   Last year, for instance, the office issued a license forthe sale of 20,000 rounds of ammunition for grenade launchersto a company in Singapore. When auditors for Mr. Funk checkedon the case, they found that some of the ammunition had beenaddressed to a North Korean embassy, according to officials.   In another case, 2,000 military pistols were exported to aprivate company in Israel. But auditors found the Tel Avivaddress where the pistols were supposed to be delivered was,in fact, a boarded-up building, the officials said.   The trade controls office was reorganized in January 1990after Mr. Funk criticized its operations. The office is partof the Bureau of Politico-Military Affairs, which is headedby Richard Clarke, an assistant secretary of state. Mr.Funk's report will recommend that Mr. Clarke be disciplinedfor failing to act on intelligence reports primarilyinvolving Israel.</TEXT></DOC>
