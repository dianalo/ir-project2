Gilbert, its president, chief executive officer and a board member, resigned all three posts.    Richard A. Berreth, executive vice president, operations, also resigned, the mobile-home maker said. Both resignations were effective immediately.    A Winnebago spokesman wouldn't comment beyond what was included in the company's brief announcement of the resignations. Mr. Gilbert couldn't be reached for comment. Mr. Berreth, reached at home last night, declined to comment.    A seven-person &quot;management council,&quot; headed by Bryan A. Hays, vice president, sales and marketing, was formed to manage the operations of the company, Winnebago said.    Richard Hanley, an independent securities analyst in New York, said the company was rumored to be suffering production problems in July and August that &quot;held up deliveries in August in particular.&quot; He said that apparently Mr. Gilbert and Mr. Berreth were taking &quot;too technologically advanced&quot; an approach to a production process that remains very much a labor-intensive operation.    &quot;They've got the worst behind them now, but it will take several months to get fully back on track,&quot; Mr. Hanley said.    In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Winnebago shares closed at $9, up 25 cents.    Mr. Gilbert, 55 years old, joined Winnebago 2 1/2 years ago as part of a management shakeup aimed at improving the company's profitability. Before coming to Winnebago he was vice president, operations support services, at Control Data Corp.    Winnebago chairman and founder John K. Hanson, who controls just under 50% of the company's stock, is known as a relatively volatile executive, analysts said, and reportedly had a direct role in pressuring Mr. Gilbert and Mr. Berreth to resign.    Mr. Hanson couldn't be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
