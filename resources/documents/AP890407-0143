State officials said they welcomed help to move equipment, butsaid beach cleanup was futile now. They also said they worked outan agreement between Exxon and the Coast Guard to transfer moremanagement responsibility to the federal agency.   Exxon will handle contracts and purchases and the Coast Guardwill direct field activity, said Dennis Kelso, commissioner of theDepartment of Environmental Conservation.   ``It's a resolution of what we thought was a real logjam,''Kelso said.   With the nation's worst crude oil spill in its third week, Exxonmade a second public apology and the tanker's captain made bail oncharges that he was drunk when his ship went aground.   The Good Friday spill of 10.1 million gallons has killedthousands of seabirds and otters in the snowy landscape on thecentral Alaskan coast. Fishermen have lost millions of dollars.   And despite cleanup efforts by industry, government and privatecitizens, the spill has spread to more than 2,600 square miles.   ``It's just immense,'' Jim Hayden, who is coordinating thecleanup for the state, said Thursday. ``I don't think a spill ofthis size is controllable.''   Bush today directed Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to ``makeavailable U.S. military forces personnel and equipment to assist inthe cleanup.'' The president also directed Transportation SecretarySamuel Skinner to oversee the cleanup effort, but he said, ``We arenot federalizing this operation.''   ``This should not relieve Exxon from any of its responsibilitiesor liabilities,'' Bush said in the White House briefing room,accompanied by Cabinet members and Alaska's congressionalcontingent.   He conceded the job of cleaning up the oil that has washed upalong the Alaskan coast with devastating effect on wildlife ``willbe massive, prolonged and frustrating. Nothing we can do willresolve this problem in the short term.''   Kelso said the military was welcome to help move equipment, butthere was no need to line the shore with troops.   ``We think that deployment of equipment and material that arepromised are the key elements right now,'' Kelso said. ``Morepeople will be needed for shoreline cleanup but that is not whatthe proper focus should be right now.''   Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., the consortium of oil companiesthat owns and operates the 800-mile trans-Alaska oil pipeline andthe Valdez terminal, announced Thursday that it would immediatelybegin requiring random drug and alcohol testing aboard all vesselsusing the terminal.   Alyeska also said it would require tugboat escorts for allentering and departing vessels to a point beyond Bligh Reef, wherethe Exxon Valdez ran aground.   Late Thursday the oily sheen was reported lapping at the rockson islands near Kenai Fjords National Park, a remote refuge 100miles southwest of Valdez. Ron Smith, a spokesman for afederal-state cleanup effort, said new booms were being put up toprotect the area of inlets and fjords.   Closer to the spill site, local fishermen continued their fightto save the salmon fishery at three-mile-long Sawmill Bay, usingfishing nets to corral the oil and ``super sucker'' vacuum trucksto remove it and protect millions of salmon fry.   Rand Little, product manager for the Prince William SoundAquaculture Corp., said oil breached one of three booms protectingthe young salmon. Fishermen were able to repair the breach beforedamage was done.   But fishermen worried about high tides this weekend that couldlift the oil over the booms and complained that they couldn't emptytheir oil-filled barges because of a lack of pumps.   The frustration with the slow cleanup wasn't confined to areafishermen. Alaska legislators have introduced several billsdesigned to better prepare the state in the event of future spills.And Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., said his two-day tour of PrinceWilliam Sound convinced him oil industry contingency plans for aspill were ``essentially a fraud on the public.''   ``The industry effort to clean up this spill ... is almostnonexistent,'' said Miller, head of the congressional subcommitteeoverseeing oil exploration.   Exxon Chairman L.G. Rawl issued a second apology for the spill,caused when the tanker Exxon Valdez struck a reef outside thenormal shipping channel, but said the company's response to theaccident was ``immediate and thorough.''   On the East Coast, the captain of the tanker that spread theoily disaster was free after his bail was reduced to $25,000 from$1 million. The judge said the former skipper, Joseph Hazelwood ofHuntington, N.Y., was unlikely to flee.   Hazelwood, 42, faces charges in Alaska of operating a ship whiledrunk, reckless endangerment and negligent discharge of oil; anextradition request from Alaska is pending. The misdemeanors carrya maximum penalty of 2\ years in prison and a $10,000 fine uponconviction.   Hazelwood had turned over control of the tanker to a third mate,who was not certified to pilot the boat in the sound.   Bodies of birds and otters are sinking below the surface andwashing out to sea, fish and game department spokeswoman SheilaNickerson said. One survey vessel counted 200 dead birds along oneshore, she said.   The Animal Rescue Center has received 138 birds, mostly loons,ducks, mergansers and cormorants. Four birds have been cleaned andreleased, 43 have died. About half the 68 otters brought in havedied.</TEXT></DOC>
