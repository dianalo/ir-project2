Wells Rich and France's Boulet Dru Dupuy Petit, whichbought its stake a year ago, are expected to announce theirplans on June 11, the executives said, likely adding the BDDPname to Wells Rich's. The two companies would combine tooperate much the way global agencies such as BBDO orMcCann-Erickson operate now.</LP><TEXT>   Terms of the transaction couldn't be learned, though BDDPisn't expected to buy all of the remaining 60%. Industryexecutives believe the total value of that stake is $25million to $30 million.   Executives at both BDDP and New York-based Wells Richdeclined to comment on the talks. Wells Rich Chairman,Kenneth Olshan, said he would have &quot;an extensive announcementwith several pieces&quot; on June 11, but &quot;it would be premature&quot;to comment now. Jean-Claude Boulet, who heads up BDDP, saidof the majority stake, &quot;It could happen, but it's too earlyto talk about it.&quot;   Wells Rich, known for ads for International BusinessMachines Corp. and Sheraton hotels among others, had billingsof $845 million last year, according to Advertising Age.BDDP, with billings of $1.49 billion in 1990, shares severaladvertising clients with Wells Rich including Hertz, Midasand Tag-Heuer S.A., a Swiss watch maker. Mr. Olshan alreadyis vice chairman of BDDP and would remain in charge of U.S.operations.   Some executives familiar with the talks painted a visionof a sweeping world-wide network that would go far beyondWells Rich's current status as a primarily American agency.Unlike American-based networks, such as Omnicom Group's BBDOor Interpublic Group's McCann-Erickson, this network would bemultinational, the executives said.   Other networks &quot;are dominated by one culture -- in mostcases an American culture,&quot; one of the executives said. BDDPand Wells Rich &quot;are building the first truly multinationalcompany. It's a natural evolution of the association thatstarted a year ago.&quot; The only other agency group thatattempted to forge a &quot;multicultural&quot; network was theill-fated HDM, a joint venture unit of agencies in the U.S.,Japan and France. It has since merged to become Lord Dentsu,a joint venture between Young andamp; Rubicam and Japan's Dentsuagency.   BDDP is expanding its control of Wells Rich at a time whenthe 25-year-old agency's fortunes have been fading. Just lastmonth, the agency lost one of its best-known accounts, the$20 million Benson andamp; Hedges cigarette account from PhilipMorris Cos. Last fall, the agency suffered a major blow whenMCI Communications Corp. pulled its $50 million-plus account.And even one of its big wins from last year has become aheadache, as Continental Airlines Holdings Inc. has run intosevere financial problems.   But Wells Rich remains a strong agency name with a rosterof blue-chip clients. Perhaps partly because of its recentsetbacks, executives on both sides of the Atlantic areapprehensive about the appearance that the French firm mightbe gobbling up its American partner. &quot;It's much more like amerger or partnership,&quot; one executive stressed, &quot;than anacquisition.&quot;   ---   Product Placement Petition                                                                                                          Several public-interest groups petitioned the FederalTrade Commission to require that notices be shown beforemovies that contain so-called &quot;product placement&quot;advertising.   In such advertising, companies pay Hollywood studios tohave their products displayed prominently in films. Thepetition, filed by the Center for the Study of Commercialism,the Consumer Federation of America and other groups, alsoasks the FTC to investigate what they called widespreadadvertising in five recent box-office hits. They include&quot;Ghost,&quot; &quot;Pretty Woman,&quot; &quot;Home Alone,&quot; &quot;Teenage Mutant NinjaTurtles&quot; and &quot;Total Recall.&quot;   For example, &quot;Total Recall&quot; focuses on the far-off futureand trips to Mars -- but it, nonetheless, contains &quot;at least55 references to 28 brand-name products,&quot; the groupscontended. &quot;Home Alone&quot; includes some 42 references to 31brand names; a reference can mean simply showing a producton-screen.   But the solution proposed by the groups may only end upgiving the sponsors a double-dose of exposure, by requiringstudios to list them by name before the start of each film.The proposed on-screen notice would read: &quot;The motion pictureyou are about to see contains advertisements for thefollowing products, paid for by the following companies . ..&quot;   ---   Ad Notes. . . .                                                                                                          NEW ACCOUNT: British Sky Broadcasting namedMcCann-Erickson's London office to handle the creativeportion of its estimated $42 million ad account.

BACKER SPIELVOGEL: Jerrold H. Gottlieb left his post asgeneral manager of Hal Riney andamp; Partners's New York office tojoin Backer Spielvogel Bates as executive vice president withresponsibility for the Mars account.

CONDOMS: A Boston television station has refused acommercial from convenience-store chain Store 24 because thead mentions condoms. The ad doesn't show condoms and mentionsthem only in the context of other items such as Twinkies andFroot Loops.
