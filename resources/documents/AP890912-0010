JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Three federal agencies are denouncing anenvironmental group's campaign against the use of pesticides onfood, saying it pressures grocers to make regulatory decisionsbetter left to the government.   The effort by the National Toxics Campaign ``appears to attemptto put the onus for pesticide regulation inappropriately on the U.S.grocery industry,'' said a joint statement by the EnvironmentalProtection Agency, the Food and Drug Administration and theAgriculture Department.   The Boston-based environmental group on Monday announcedagreement with a small number of grocery chains to sign a pledgedesigned to reduce pesticides on fresh fruits and vegetables.   However, the federal agencies said the government seeks ``tobalance the benefits and risks of pesticides,'' and accused theenvironmentalists of ignoring the fact that pesticides rid foodproducts of diseases that could pose serious health concerns.   The grocery industry also attacked the effort, saying theenvironmental group was ``seeking to create a major crisis ofconfidence'' in the nation's food supply. Industry spokesmen accusedthe group of trying ``to pit company against company and retailersagainst their suppliers.''   The use of pesticides on food has gained widespread attentionfollowing the uproar earlier this year over Alar, which ultimatelywas pulled off the U.S. market by its manufacturer after sales ofapple products plummeted, costing the industry an estimated $100million.   Craig Merrilees, director of the environmental group's ConsumerPesticide Project, expressed surprise at the strong industry andgovernment reaction, but said the group is enlisting grocers asallies in the war against pesticides because government regulationhas not done the job.   ``We've given up on our government's ability to deal withpesticides,'' said Merrilees.   The companies that signed the agreement represent fewer than 200stores in the United States, but Merrilees called theirparticipation ``a major breakthrough'' in getting supermarkets tobreak ranks with most of the industry on the pesticide issue.   Signing the agreement were four regional U.S. grocery chains anda large Canadian chain, and Merrilees' group said it hopes toconvince other chains to join. According to industry figures, thereare more than 35,000 supermarkets in the United States.   Dr. Samuel Epstein, a professor of environmental medicine at theUniversity of Illinois and persistent critic of the widespread useof pesticides, maintained there has been a ``virtual total failureof the regulatory system'' in protecting consumers againstpesticides in foods.   ``We're now seeing the emergence of market force pressures,''said Epstein, who participated in the environmental group's newsconference Monday.   The agreement announced Monday commits the retailers to littlebeyond general goals of seeking a reduction in pesticides on foods.   In the agreement, the grocers pledge to ``request'' growers todisclose what pesticides were used on produce; to ``activelyencourage'' the phasing out of cancer-causing chemicals on produceby 1995, and to, ``whenever economically feasible ... carrycertified organic produce and produce certified to contain nodetected pesticide residues.''   Nevertheless, spokesmen for distributors, processors andretailers of fruits and vegetables denounced the campaign.   ``We do not want to be the nation's food police,'' declared KarenBrown, a spokeswoman for the Food Marketing Institute, a trade grouprepresenting more than 1,500 grocery chains and stores.   ``These organizations are seeking to create a major crisis ofconfidence in the food supply ... (and) coerce supermarket retailersinto assuming the job of government,'' said Robert Carey, presidentof the Produce Marketing Association.   The five retail grocery chains that are participating in theNational Toxics Campaign program are: Provigo Inc., the secondlargest grocery chain in Canada with more than 1,000 stores; PetriniSupermarkets, a subsidiary of Provigo, 23 stores in the SanFrancisco area; Raley's Supermarkets, 57 stores in the Sacramento,Calif., area; ABCO Supermarkets, 87 stores in Arizona; and Bread andamp;Circus, a chain of five natural foods supermarkets in the Bostonarea.</TEXT></DOC>
