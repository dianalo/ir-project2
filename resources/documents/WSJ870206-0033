As a result, the company posted a net loss of $238,000 for the third quarter ended Dec. 31.    The company said the two nonrecurring charges totaled $589,000 before taxes and represented non-cash settlements.    In last year's third quarter, Odetics had net income of $181,000, or five cents a share. Revenue rose 19% for the third quarter to $9.7 million from $8.2 million a year earlier.    The firm's products include robotic systems and subsystems and information-processing products that record digital, video and audio information.    Odetics said it will pay plaintiffs Class A common stock in the out-of-court settlement.    The suit charged that the company, certain officers, directors and selling shareholders violated federal securities laws by failing to disclose material information about the company's business, operations and financial condition. A court hearing on the settlement has been set for Feb. 20. The specific number of shares will be determined later, a spokesman said.    Joel Slutzky, Odetics chairman, said that the proposed settlement doesn't constitute an admission of liability or wrongdoing, and that it was agreed to &quot;in order to avoid the continuation of costly, time-consuming litigation.&quot;    Odetics said it wrote off its entire investment in Infodetics, a closely held, Anaheim-based maker of data storage and retrieval systems, which filed Jan. 28 for court protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code. Under Chapter 11, a company continues operating with protection from creditors' lawsuits while working out a plan to pay debt.    Odetics had owned 60,000 of the company's 1.1 million shares and was owed $150,216 in loans from Infodetics.    A company spokesman declined to break down the specific loss from each of the two items.    For the nine months, the company had a net loss of $165,000, compared with a net loss of $307,000 a year earlier. Nine-month revenue rose 17% to $28.3 million from $24.3 million a year ago. </TEXT></DOC>
