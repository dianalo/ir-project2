<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-15-0751 </DOCNO><TEXT>A method has been incorporated into the Westinghouse advanced nodal code.(ANC) to account for isotopic variations due to changes in local spectrumconditions from reference conditions. Correction factors are generatedat each burnup step by comparison of the actual and reference conditionsduring the depletion. The method requires very little additional corestorage and negligible computation time. Tests of the method by varyinglocal core conditions, e.g., moderator density, soluble boron concentration,core power, far from their reference values showed that it can trackthe microdepletion-induced reactivity changes with sufficient accuracy,especially in the important burnup range of 10 to 30 GWd/tonne U, where90% of the reactivity changes are captured.</TEXT></DOC>
