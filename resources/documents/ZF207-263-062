(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Steve HigginsandM;As delays from chip developer Texas Instruments Inc. promise to keepthird-party 16M-bps Token-Ring products off the shelf until the fall at thevery earliest, two other chip makers are laying the foundation for morewidely available, competitively priced products, according to industrysources.andM;Toshiba Electronic Components Inc. and Western Digital Corp., both of Irvine,Calif., are working on their own versions of 16M-bps Token-Ring controllers,sources close to Toshiba and officials at Western Digital said.andP;  TexasInstruments (TI) announced its offering late last year, one month after IBMlaunched the technology.andM;Western Digital officials said the firm's chip would not be available untilsometime next year, citing the large amount of software that must be writtento make the chip work.andP;  An early version of the Toshiba chip was displayed ata circuit conference in February, sources said, but Toshiba officials wouldnot comment on the chip.andM;The commercial release of TI's chip, currently available only in samplequantities, had been slated for next month but is now planned for Septemberwhile TI runs further tests, said a spokesman for the Houston-based firm.andP;  Asa result, the release of hardware from about 20 third-party vendors won'tbegin at least until the fall.andP;  IBM is shipping its own $900 Micro Channeladapters for the 16M-bps Token-Ring.andM;Availability of the Western Digital and Toshiba chips is expected to increasethe options for third-party vendors and possibly lower the cost of theirproducts, the developers said.andM;''It will improve the pricing overall,'' said Phil Edholm, director ofmarketing for Hughes LAN Systems in Mountain View, Calif., which is workingon a backbone product based on the TI chip.andP;  If there are no alternatives toTI's chip, TI will charge hardware developers whatever it can, he said.andM;Other vendors developing 16M-bps Token-Ring hardware are skeptical that theWestern Digital and Toshiba offerings will have a significant impact.andM;''A second or third chip, unless it was totally compatible with TI, wouldhave to go through extensive product qualification,'' said Mike Morris, aproduct marketing manager for Pure Data Inc., a Carrollton, Texas, maker ofadapter cards.andP;  Pure Data plans to offer a 16M-bps adapter after TI's chip isreleased.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
