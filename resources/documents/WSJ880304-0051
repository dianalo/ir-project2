Tisch &quot;maliciously and fraudulently&quot; underpaid records executives by more than $1.5 million in agreed-upon bonuses.    The lawsuit was filed yesterday in New York state court on behalf of more than 100 executives of CBS Records Inc., now owned by Sony Corp. of Japan but still based at the New York headquarters of its former parent. It seeks the bonus money plus $3 million in punitive damages and additional legal costs.    The suit is the latest salvo in an escalating spat between CBS and the former unit. Since the Nov. 19 agreement to sell the group for $2 billion and the Jan. 5 completion of the deal, records executives have charged that CBS is intentionally withholding financial data affecting the final price Sony will pay and their bonuses.    &quot;CBS won't even tell us the numbers to this day -- what are they hiding?&quot; says Walter Yetnikoff, president of CBS Records. Mr. Yetnikoff personally made millions of dollars as a finder's fee in the Sony sale, and he isn't a party in the suit. </TEXT></DOC>
