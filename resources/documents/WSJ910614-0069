Funds specializing in Europe have eked out average gainsof just over 2% this year, compared with almost 21% for theaverage stock fund tracked by Lipper Analytical Services.These lousy returns haven't been lost on investors, who arenow shunning funds that specialize in European securities.</LP><TEXT>   But some investment advisers think these funds are a goodbet, partly because European stocks look cheap and partlybecause they believe the dollar's rally is petering out.   &quot;People have been scared away by the rising dollar,&quot; saysDavid Tepper, a San Francisco investment adviser specializingin publicly traded mutual funds. &quot;I'm looking for relativevalue, and these {funds} are cheaper on a relative basis thanthey've been in a long time.&quot; Publicly traded European stockfunds, which last year traded at premium prices, can today bebought for less than 85% of the value of their stockportfolios.   According to Morgan Stanley Capital International, bothEuropean stocks and U.S. stocks are up slightly more than 20%so far this year. But because the dollar's rally has slashedthe value of European investments when translated into U.S.currency, an American investor with money in European stocksprobably hasn't earned anything like 20%.   &quot;It's important to distinguish between what has happenedto these markets in local currency terms and what they havedone in U.S. dollars,&quot; says John Ford, a portfolio managerwith the $98 million T. Rowe Price European Stock Fund. Afterfactoring in the dollar's rise against other currencies,European markets are up just 7% so far this year.   Most mutual funds that specialize in European stockshaven't even done that well. According to Lipper Analytical,the average European stock fund is up just 2.5% in the firstfive months of 1991.   T. Rowe Price's Mr. Ford figures that -- in terms of thedollar's rally -- &quot;most of the damage has been done. Over thenext six to nine months, we think the dollar will be firmagainst the {German} mark. Longer term, we see the mark as astrong currency.&quot;   Mr. Ford also thinks that, despite this year's stockmarket rally, &quot;the European markets are not very expensive --they're reasonable value.&quot;   Morgan Stanley keeps tabs on how global stock pricescompare to four key yardsticks, book value, earnings, cashflow and dividend yield. According to each of these measures,European stocks are cheaper than U.S. stocks.   For people given to bargain-hunting, one way to play theEuropean markets is through publicly traded mutual funds.Unlike a regular mutual fund, these so-called closed-endfunds only issue a fixed number of shares, which then tradepublicly just like any other stock.   Closed-end fund shares are initially sold at a premium tothe value of the fund's portfolio. But soon after, theseshares tend to fall to a discount, so that investors can buya fund for less than the value of the fund's portfolio.   That is just what has happened with the closed-end fundsthat specialize in European stocks. Scudder New Europe Fund,for instance, closed yesterday at $8.625, an 18% discount toits $10.53 per-share portfolio value.   New York investor Michael Meer actively trades closed-endfunds for his own account. Right now, he is hanging onto afistful of European single-country funds, as well as ScudderNew Europe. &quot;It's a way to play a weakening dollar,&quot; says Mr.Meer.   Those wanting to bet against the dollar -- and bet onEuropean stocks -- should pick their fund carefully.Closed-end funds like Scudder New Europe and GT GreaterEurope Fund are heavily invested in smaller company stocks,which tend to be riskier investments, while mutual funds suchas Financial Strategic's European Portfolio and T. Rowe PriceEuropean Stock Fund are largely invested in bigger companystocks.   These funds also have widely varying exposure to currencymovements. Scudder New Europe has never used currencyhedging, which can be costly, so the fund should benefit fromany slip in the dollar's value relative to Europeancurrencies. Similarly, Europe Fund -- another closed-end fund-- isn't hedged at all right now.   Among mutual funds, the T. Rowe Price European Stock Fundhas just 5% of its currency exposure hedged, and FinancialStrategic's European Portfolio is 30% hedged. VanguardGroup's European Portfolio -- which is an index mutual fundthat simply buys and holds most of the 600 stocks that makeup Morgan Stanley's European stock-index -- never usescurrency hedging.   By contrast, GT Greater Europe currently has 80% of itscurrency exposure hedged away, so the fund's portfolio won'tsuffer much if the dollar rallies further. Portfolio managerNigel Ledeboer reckons that European stocks are far frombeing overvalued. But for a U.S. investor, he says, &quot;thecurrency play is likely to go the wrong way.&quot;   Mr. Ledeboer thinks that the dollar is undervalued basedon its purchasing power compared with the German mark. Hethinks that the dollar -- which currently trades at less than1.8 marks -- could rise to 1.9 or 2 marks by year end.</TEXT></DOC>
