To reach thefinancial optimum for the municipality, one condition is a 'pay-back'for the service to the recovery sector. It is also necessary to examinethe effects of a generalisation of the pay-back solution at a macro-economiclevel. The result also depends on the practical rules of auction andcollection (selective and extensive, or exhaustive). In addition theintegration of the recovery with the disposal, and vice versa, is examined.</TEXT></DOC>
