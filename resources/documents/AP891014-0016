(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The country's top business leaders aretrying to explain the deepest dive in the stock market since theOctober crash of 1987 while they look with concern to the effectthe plunge will have on their companies.   ``The thing you think about right away is what is going tohappen on Monday,'' said David T. Kearns, the head of Xerox.   The nearly 191-point plunge in the Dow Jones industrial averageon Friday was an unwelcome and surprising intrusion into the fallmeetings of the Business Council at a posh resort in the Virginiamountains.   Many of the executives learned about the market's nose divewhile they were on the golf course or playing tennis.   Many executives, who were wrapping up their sessions today,suggested that the drop was the result of spreading problems in the``junk bond'' market. Junk bonds, used to finance leveragedbuyouts, have been a driving force behind the market's rise thisyear.   Searching for a silver lining to the sell-off, some businessleaders said it could end up a positive development if it moderatesthe frenzy of corporate takeovers which are leaving many U.S.companies burdened with heavy debt loads.   Allen Murray, chairman of Mobil Corp., said the market plungecould turn out to be a good thing if it ``leads to a flight toquality'' stocks and away from heavy speculation about takeoverpossibilities.   John Akers, the head of IBM Corp., said he was concerned atakeover epidemic had left many corporations so deeply in debt theycould be in serious trouble the next time interest rates increase.   After surveying the damage, the business leaders are wonderingwhether the market will stabilize on Monday or continue falling.   ``Anytime you have the market drop by (191) points, if youaren't concerned, there's something wrong with you,'' said JohnMcGillicuddy, head of Manufacturers Hanover Corp.   Still, many are sticking to the upbeat forecast of economicprospects for next year that the business leaders had offeredbefore the stock market plunge.   They had said economic growth would slow significantly next yearbut that the country should be able to avoid a recession. Theyforecast growth would rebound in 1991.   Some, noting the sharp economic rebound following the 508-pointplunge of Oct. 19, 1987, dismissed the new dive as a one-day shockwhich did nothing to shake their belief in continued prosperity.   ``I don't think this says anything about the overall economy,''said General Motors Chairman Roger B. Smith. ``This was a reactionto leveraged buyouts.''   Rand Araskog, the chairman of ITT, said he hoped the market'splunge signaled politicians that more government regulation isneeded to curb the wave of corporate takeovers.   ``The whole thing is a lot of nonsense and it should bestopped,'' he said. ``We have a very nervous marketplace.''</TEXT></DOC>
