SEWARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>GDANSK, Poland (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Leaders of a one-day strike were firedWednesday for organizing the walkout to protest a governmentdecision to close Lenin Shipyard, the birthplace of Solidarity,state media reported.   The announcement came hours after strikers at two shipyards endedtheir protests at the request of Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, whoargued that there was ``no other path than reconciliation.''   The state-run PAP news agency said the director of the RepairShipyard in Gdansk ``sacked the inspirators of the strike action''at the 4,500-worker yard.   It did not mention firings at the other yard that was struck, the1,000-worker Wisla Shipyard.   On Thursday, ``all employees will be admitted to work with theexception of those who have been given notice,'' PAP said. It didnot say how may workers were dismissed.   The immediate publicity given the firings seemed to signal thatauthorities are taking a tough line against strikers. The move alsoseemed likely to undercut Walesa, who had urged strikers to moderatetheir actions.   Hundreds of mainly young workers went on strike Tuesday, withoutWalesa's approval, demanding reversal of a government order to beginliquidation of the Lenin Shipyard on Dec. 1. They ended the strikesafter repeated appeals from Walesa and a threat of dismissals frommanagement.   ``I would like to thank very much all the striking people, theyouth, for subordinating to my request,'' Walesa said at St.Brygida's Church, a headquarters of the banned trade union, soonafter hearing of the end of the second strike.   Solidarity was crushed in 1981 with the imposition of martial lawand outlawed the following year.   ``I hope in the future, if there is such a necessity, we willfight together,'' Walesa said.   Walesa argued that striking was counterproductive at the moment,and attention should be focused on starting blocked talks withauthorities and the opposition on Poland's future.   ``For Poland there is no other path than reconciliation, meetinghalfway to solve our problems, including social, political andeconomic pluralism,'' he told reporters.   But he added: ``We will fight for the shipyard sooner or later,and we will regain it.''   An undetermined number of workers gave up a strike Wednesdaymorning at Wisla Shipyard, which makes yachts and small river craft,after being promised that those who took part in the strike wouldnot be fired, the yard's strike leader Jan Stanecki said. He saidseveral hundred workers supported the strike.   At the Repair Shipyard, 200 workers who rallied Wednesday morningended their strike at around 1 p.m., one hour after management saidthey must leave or be fired, said Krzysztof Kamolak, one of thestrike committee members.   ``We decided to leave because it made no sense to fight,'' hesaid.   Walesa said he continues to face resistance from young workerswho are impatient for promised round-table talks to begin. The talkswere offered by the government in August, in exchange for whichWalesa ended Poland's worst labor unrest in seven years.   ``I can't complain about the youth, who are fed up with theconditions in which they live,'' Walesa said.   Preparations for the talks broke down when Walesa refused topurge from Solidarity's proposed delegation two people whom thegovernment has deemed extremist. Solidarity also says it will nottalk until authorities hire back about 100 coal miners fired forstriking in August.   Walesa said Tuesday he was not as concerned about an immediatereversal of the closure decision as before, and that he might talkto authorities even without a guarantee of the yard's future.   The government announced Tuesday that the Lenin Shipyard'sdirector, Czeslaw Tolwinski, who previously protested the closure,has been put in charge of the liquidation. Solidarity activists saidTolwinski assured Walesa that the closure will not be abrupt.   But Walesa complained he still has had no reply to a letter hesent Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak last week calling onKiszczak to remove the obstacles to the talks.   The government also claims it wants the talks to begin, but itsays it would be useless to talk to extremists. Officials object tolongtime Solidarity advisers Adam Michnik and Jacek Kuron.</TEXT></DOC>
