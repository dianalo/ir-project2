The Justice Department is slowly moving toward bringing anindictment in the December 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103,which killed 270 people -- including 189 Americans -- overLockerbie, Scotland.</LP><TEXT>   Whether that indictment emerges, and just whom it names,will be important clues to how much the U.S. is prepared tosacrifice foreign-policy considerations to fight terrorism.   The Lockerbie massacre is unique in terrorist annalsbecause, according to the best information available toWestern intelligence, it was a joint effort by the world'sthree leading state sponsors of terrorism: Iran, Syria andLibya.   The intelligence agencies' working theory is that Iranpaid for the bombing, possibly to retaliate for the U.S.Navy's downing of an Iranian airliner. They believe the crimewas masterminded on Iran's behalf by a Syrian-basedPalestinian terror group close to President Hafez Assad. Theyfurther believe that the terror group, the Popular Front forthe Liberation of Palestinian-General Command, hired Libyanoperatives to assemble and plant the bomb by concealing it ina suitcase on a connecting flight from Malta.   Officials hint that the lowest-level thugs involved, theLibyans, are likely to be indicted. The key question iswhether their Syrian masters or Iranian financiers will alsobe charged. If they aren't, suspicions will run strong thatthey were spared because President Bush and Secretary ofState James Baker are forging an alliance with SyrianPresident Assad and looking for improved relations with Iranas well.   Kathleen Flynn, a Washington woman who lost her son, John,in the bombing, says she has told Federal Bureau ofInvestigation Director William Sessions: &quot;I don't want justthese low-life Libyans. I want them to go all the way.&quot;   Rosemary Wolfe, a government employee whose stepdaughter,Miriam, died in the blast, says: &quot;I'm worried that they'llonly indict the Libyans. They may not name the people reallyresponsible: Syria and Iran.&quot;   Nobody knows how the investigation will end. It ispossible that Syrians and Iranians won't be indicted becauseof the difficulty of building a case against them, as much asbecause of diplomatic pressures. It's far easier for spyagencies to sketch out a theory than for law enforcementagencies to make it stand up in court.   On April 8, Mr. Sessions wrote to Susan Cohen, anotherparent of a Pan Am 103 victim, that &quot;the FBI remainssteadfastly committed to bringing those responsible for thisheinous crime to justice.&quot; But he added that &quot;no decision hasbeen made as yet with regard to public indictments&quot; andhinted that any indictments might be handed down secretly,under seal. He said such secrecy might make arrests morelikely. But it also could spare embarrassment to the threecountries believed to have been involved.   The key to the case is a paunchy, mustachioed killer namedAhmad Jibril, boss of the PFLP-GC and President Assad'sresident Palestinian leader. Mr. Assad contends he has no wayof knowing what Mr. Jibril's group does, but U.S.intelligence officials scoff at that. Mr. Jibril, a formerSyrian army officer, leads a group that was created andnurtured by Syria and is carefully monitored by PresidentAssad's security apparatus. He has long been Syria'scandidate to supplant Yassir Arafat as leader of thePalestinians.   &quot;Jibril doesn't make a move without Assad knowing,&quot; saysone intelligence source. &quot;Assad had to at least wink at PanAm 103, if not encourage it.&quot;   President Assad has refused U.S. demands that he expel theJibril group. If Mr. Jibril or his henchman were indicted inthe Pan Am case, Damascus would be very reluctant toextradite them, especially now that Mr. Arafat's power iswaning. That could well wreck the U.S.-Syrian ties born inthe war against Iraq and now being used by Mr. Baker to tryto get Arab-Israeli talks going.   So far, the administration's conduct toward Syria doesn'tseem wholly reassuring. During Mr. Baker's first visit toDamascus last September, he was irritated that reporters keptasking about Pan Am 103. He, in turn, irritated intelligenceagencies by appearing to take seriously Mr. Assad's claimsthat Syria wasn't acting against the PFLP-GC because itlacked convincing evidence against the group.   When the long-awaited indictment materializes, Mrs. Flynn,Mrs. Wolfe, Mrs. Cohen and others will be watching.</TEXT></DOC>
