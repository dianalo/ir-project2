The latest monthly survey by the National Association of Purchasing Management reported that the growth rate of new orders in April kept pace with the previous month while production expanded at a sharply faster rate. Prices also gained sharply, according to the purchasers.    Their views come as economists worry that too much growth may fuel inflation and prompt the Federal Reserve System to tighten credit.    &quot;The economy began the second quarter with continuing moderate growth,&quot; said Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the association's business survey committee. &quot;New orders remain very healthy, particularly export orders,&quot; and almost ensure &quot;another modest but respectable quarter of economic growth,&quot; said Mr. Bretz, who also is director of materials management at Pitney Bowes Inc.    The purchasing managers' index rose 1.6 percentage points in April to 54.9%, reaching the same level as in February. The index measures new orders, production, vendor deliveries, inventory and employment.    April marked the 21st consecutive month the index topped 50%. A reading above 50% is said to indicate the economy is generally expanding while one below 50% suggests it is declining.    For the year through April, the index averaged 55.1%. The group figures that if that average holds for the rest of 1988, it would be consistent with real, or inflation-adjusted, growth in the gross national product of about 3.4%.    According to the survey, 37% of the purchasers believed new orders were better in April -- the most since September 1987. The association said the rate of growth should all but ensure &quot;continued growth in production over the next 30 to 60 days.&quot;    The survey is compiled from data provided by more than 250 purchasing managers. It looks at several economic measures and asks whether each category strengthened or weakened from the previous month.    Production expanded for the 16th consecutive month, with 37% of the purchasers indicating higher output. The proportion of purchasers reporting higher prices rose to 70%, the largest response since March 1980. &quot;The signs of price plateauing noted in the past three months disappeared in April,&quot; the association said.    Mr. Bretz said the number of members reporting higher prices &quot;isn't a comforting sign, and one we have to watch very carefully.&quot; He added inflation unquestionably is heating up in some basic materials, which would eventually be passed on in higher prices for finished goods.    Reports of higher employment also edged up, although the group noted that excluding seasonal increases, the move could be viewed as a small decline.    The survey found that prices continued rising for scores of commodities and materials such as paper products, metals and chemicals. The only price declines noted were in fuel oil, natural gas, coal and vegetable oils. The purchasers said lead times shortened considerably on many products in April. But the group added that several metals and chemicals remained in short supply. </TEXT></DOC>
