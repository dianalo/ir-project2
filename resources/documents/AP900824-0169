Today's generation of stock traders and analysts is by no meansunaccustomed to to the phenomenon of falling markets. Most of themwere around for the Crash of 1987, which provided all theconditions you could want for a baptism of fire.   That debacle produced a 36 percent drop in the Dow Jonesindustrial average, enough to rank prominently on any list ofmodern-day market declines.   But almost all the carnage occurred in a span of less than twomonths, and stocks began to recover quickly thereafter en route tonew highs.   Many an investor, it appeared, was still numb from the shockwhen the wounds began to heal.   For an undisputed example of the kind of long, debilitatingslide for which classic bear markets are famous, one has to go backto 1981-82, before the big boom of the '80s on Wall Street wasready to start.   From April 27, 1981 to Aug. 12, 1982, the Dow Jones industrialstumbled from 1,024.05 to 776.92 as the economy struggled through arecession exacerbated by rapid inflation and high interest rates.   Instead of the sudden jolt of a crash, the market in those daysexperienced a kind of slow, steady erosion that gave investorsplenty of time to think about how much money they were losing andhow bleak the outlook seemed.   The question of the moment now, of course, is whether stocks arein for a similar malaise, or just undergoing one of the periodic``corrections'' that have punctuated the long bull market since '82.   Simple to ask, not so easy to answer. Incipient bear markets arenotoriously cunning at disguising themselves as short-termcorrections, and vice versa.   On the optimistic side, however, analysts point out thatauthentic bear markets have seldom begun with a single event thatserves as an ``explanation'' for the decline _ in this case, Iraq'sinvasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.   Indeed, many veteran market-watchers worry more when declinesset in that have no readily discernible cause.   ``Past major confrontations such as the Cuban missile crisis orother military squabbles that were resolved favorably proved to bejust a blip in the stock market's general trend,'' observes GregSmith, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities.   ``We could be in one of those blips, or this could be somethingmuch more significant.''   Norman Fosback, editor of a group of investment advisory letterspublished by the Institute for Econometric Research in FortLauderdale, Fla., plants himself squarely on the ``blip'' side ofthe argument.   ``Price weakness touched off by the geopolitical crisis does NOTconstitute a bear market,'' he declared in the firm's Mutual FundForecaster. ``It does appear to be the 10 percent to 15 percentcorrection that has been long overdue.   ``Midstream bull market corrections are nearly always abrupt.They shake out the market's weak participants by leading them tobelieve, falsely, that a bear market has begun.''   One big risk behind this view is the chance that the market haslooked beyond the Persian Gulf showdown and correctly discerned theapproach of a recession.   It will take a good while for these overlays of uncertainty tosort themselves out, observed Morton Silverman, portfoliostrategist at Piper, Jaffray andamp; Hopwood in Minneapolis.   Silverman concluded, ``it's a time for prudence, notopportunism.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Monday, Aug. 27</NOTE></DOC>
