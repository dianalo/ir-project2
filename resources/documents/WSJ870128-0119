The coalition government that voters returned to power Sunday includes Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union, the Bavarian Christian Social Union and Foreign Minister Hans Dietrich Genscher's Free Democratic Party. The CDU/CSU bloc won only about 44.3% of the vote, its worst showing since 1949. Mr. Kohl said the results were &quot;gloomy and marked a painful loss.&quot;    We've little doubt the economy is the message to be found here. For several years Mr. Kohl and his finance minister, Gerhard Stoltenberg, have been unwilling either to speed up tax cuts scheduled for later in the decade or to consider the kind of sharp reduction in top marginal rates that ignited and sustained the economic boom of the Reagan years. The Bundesbank under the direction of Karl Otto Poehl has declined to use monetary policy to help transfer to the domestic economy the vim that exporters have been enjoying. It has allowed the mark to soar not only against other currencies but also against gold.    This is little more than antique mercantilism, but its inevitably lopsided results have somehow bred an unfortunate arrogance in the West German government and many of its supporters. For example, in the midst of the recent European currency crisis one West German paper, Bild, published an open letter to the French that said &quot;the truth of the matter is that we've simply been better than you.&quot;    The election results suggest that many West German voters feel otherwise. That's not surprising: The government has been paying for its super-strong mark, its massive trade surpluses and its negative inflation rate with unemployment of 9%. Nothing before the election suggested the government was concerned with turning this around. The Bundesbank did notch down its discount rate a half a point, but it sterilized this measure with a 10% rise in the minimum reserve requirements for banks while estimates for growth in 1987 were recently revised downward to 2.5% from the earlier 3% prediction.    Voters saw through all this and pulled back votes from Mr. Kohl's party. As expected, they gave a sharp boost to the radical left-wing Greens party, which has made hay both with the Soviet Union's Chernobyl disaster and Switzerland's Rhine River chemical spill. And they took votes out of the hide of the Bavarian CSU, displaying their apparent distrust of arch-statist Franz Josef Strauss. But more significantly for Mr. Kohl, voters gave a sharp boost to his coalition partner, the Free Democratic Party.    The FDP is the one party that has at least been grappling seriously with the concept of supply-side tax cuts. The FDP's Otto Lambsdorff, a former economics minister, has helped move the FDP ahead of the Kohl-Stoltenberg combine on this issue. In an interview last month, Mr. Lambsdorff called for &quot;considerable tax cuts, which hopefully can begin in 1987.&quot; Ideally, Mr. Lambsdorff would be given an opportunity to argue his views inside the government.    As Mr. Kohl begins his second term he'd do well to harken to what the voters are saying -- they want more growth and more jobs. </TEXT></DOC>
