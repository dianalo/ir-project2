Nevada and Arizona will show the fastest growth rates inpersonal income, jobs and population between 1988 and 2000,the department predicts in a new report. One of every sixjobs created during that period will be in California, thereport says. And Florida, Utah and Hawaii also are expectedto grow rapidly.</LP><TEXT>   The report points to continued softness in northeasternstates. While total personal income is expected to grow 46.2%after inflation in Nevada and 40.6% in Arizona, it isexpected to expand only 21.6% in New England. Nationally, thedepartment expects personal income to grow 26.2% by 2000.   New England surged ahead of most of the country ineconomic growth through much of the 1980s. But in 1988, itsfortunes began to turn. Also during the past decade,increasing numbers of people and companies began to move tothe Sun Belt, which stretches from the Southeast to theSouthwest.   Kenneth Johnson, a Commerce Department analyst, saidArizona and Nevada &quot;have exhibited strength already over thelast few years. They have shown a competitive {growth}advantage over the other states and we expect that tocontinue into the year 2000.&quot;   In particular, growth in the transportation equipment andservice industries will drive economic gains in the twostates, said another department economist, Hugh Knox.   According to the report, four states -- California, NewYork, Texas and Florida -- will account for one-third of thenation's projected $4.1 trillion total personal income by2000.   While California will continue to have the highest totalpersonal income in the country, Connecticut will continue tohave the highest per capita income, rising a projected 10.8%by the end of the century to $20,503 after adjusting forinflation.   That would be 34% above the national average of $15,345.New Jersey, Massachusetts, and the District of Columbia alsoare projected to have per capita incomes 20% above thenational average.   Of the 18.9 million new jobs expected to be created in theU.S. by the end of the century, 3.4 million will be inCalifornia. Florida and Texas are projected to add more thana million new jobs each.   The projections suggest that Texas will continue torecover from the downturn caused by a plunge in oil prices inthe 1980s. Its per capita income is expected to increase18.2% between 1988 and 2000, compared with a meager 3.7% risebetween 1979 and 1988.   Nevada is projected to experience the fastest populationgrowth -- 29.8% -- followed by Arizona's 21.4% growth andFlorida's 18.2%. In Wyoming, West Virginia, and Louisiana,population is predicted to fall slightly.   ---                          Job Growth                                                                                                          Percent change in total employment, by region                                                                                                                                          1979-88     1988-2000*                                                                                                        Total United States                 18.7%        14.3% New England                         24.9         12.3 Mideast                             16.0         11.0 Great Lakes                          8.0         11.8 Plains                              11.2         11.8 Southeast                           24.2         14.9 Southwest                           21.9         15.2 Rocky Mountain                      16.9         17.0 Far West                            27.1         20.8                                                                                                          *Estimate and Source: U.S. Dept. of Commerce</TEXT></DOC>
