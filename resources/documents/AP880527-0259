Trusteeship Council on Fridaybrushed off Soviet warnings of impending U.S. militarization of theSouth Pacific territory of Palau and approved progress towardPalau's adopting a Compact of Free Association with America.   Britain, France and the United States voted in favor of a reporturging approval of the compact and recommending that any disputesin interpretion be resolved between Palau and America. The SovietUnion voted against the report.   Soviet delegate Dmitri V. Bykov also said the report failed tomention racism in the South Pacific. The British delegate, J.Stephen Smith, had accused the Soviets on Thursday of ``trying tomake twisted allegations of racism where none existed.''   Bykov said Thursday that America's true intention was to``dominate the people of the Trust Territory in order to maintainUnited States strategic dominance in the area.'' He accused theUnited States of ``planning to continue to strengthen and broadentest areas for missile technology and other military bases'' in theregion.   On Friday, U.S. Ambassador Patricia M. Bryne retorted that``contrary to the assertions of a few, the United States has notturned the Trust Territory into a military base ... and has nointention of doing so. Those who condemn the `militarization' ofMicronesia seek to mislead the world in order to advance their ownagenda in the region.''   The Soviets have sought in recent years to negotiate fishingrights with several South Pacific island nations. Since World WarII, the region had been mainly regarded as an American preservefree of Soviet influence.   In March, Adm. William Crowe, chairman of the U.S. joint chiefsof staff, told the House Foreign Affairs Committtee that Palauwould be ``one of the first ... areas that we would have to lookat'' if America could no longer keep military bases in thePhilippines, where treaty rights are under renegotiation.   The United States has administered Palau under a U.N.trusteeship since World War II, when U.S. forces drove Japaneseoccupiers from the region.   The Compact of Free Association for Palau would grant the groupof islands self-government in economic, social and educationalaffairs. The Palau Islands, with a population of about 12,000, arelocated about 500 miles east of the Philippine island of Mindanao.   In April, a court in Palau invalidated a 1987 referendum inwhich 73 percent of the voters approved the compact, ruling that a75 percent majority was required to adopt it. Palau's government isexpect to appeal the ruling.   Moscow says the U.N Security Council can dissolve thetrusteeship.</TEXT></DOC>
