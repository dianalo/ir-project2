The latest polls show the opposition Liberal Party leading the ruling Conservative Party. But Conservative strategists predict that internal squabbling over trade with the U.S. and other issues will be the Liberals' undoing by election time. The Liberals, formerly headed by Pierre Trudeau, governed Canada for most of this century and had been regarded as the free-trade party. But the current Liberal leader, John Turner, says he would &quot;tear up&quot; a pending U.S.-Canada free-trade agreement signed in January by President Reagan and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.    Leftist politicians oppose the trade pact because it is expected to give less scope for government intervention in the economy. Mr. Turner says the accord would &quot;deny the use of government as an agent of economic growth, as the cushion of social transformation and as the shield for social justice.&quot;    The Liberal Party's stand has upset many businessmen. Former Liberal fund-raiser Milton Harris recently quit the party because of its opposition to the trade accord. Mr. Harris, chairman of Toronto-based Harris Steel Group Inc., says he will work for the Conservatives in the election. Michel Drouin, another former Liberal fund-raiser, says he became disenchanted with the federal Liberals because of their &quot;move to the left under pressure from unions.&quot; The Quebec insurance executive says Liberal spending plans on social programs such as day care for children would worsen Canada's already-serious debt.    When the 58-year-old Mr. Turner, a former corporate lawyer, succeeded Mr. Trudeau as party leader in 1984, some Liberals accused him of being too right wing for the party, which has usually tried to hold the middle ground between the Conservatives and the socialist New Democratic Party.    After the Liberals lost the 1984 election, Mr. Turner shifted to the left. He no longer demands big cuts in the government deficit, instead urging a &quot;full employment strategy,&quot; and &quot;income support for all Canadians.&quot; He rejects U.S. economic and social policy. &quot;I have nothing against the American dream,&quot; he says. &quot;It works for them and I respect it. But I am not part of it and I don't want to be part of it.&quot;    Prime Minister Mulroney claimed in a recent interview that Mr. Turner has &quot;taken the Liberal Party to the left of the NDP. . . . a repudiation of all of the roots of the traditional Liberal Party.&quot;    Mr. Turner's leftward move hasn't generated as much enthusiasm from left-wing Liberals as might be expected. Some question his sincerity and some challenge his support for constitutional reforms that would recognize Quebec as a &quot;distinct society&quot; within Canada. These proposed reforms are strongly opposed by former Prime Minister Trudeau.    Mr. Turner has attracted to the party some former NDP supporters, including Maude Barlow, who advises him on &quot;social-justice issues.&quot; Ms. Barlow praises Mr. Turner for his grasp of issues such as poverty and child care.    The Liberal leader's personal standing hasn't been improved by his leftward shift. Polls show him trailing both Mr. Mulroney and NDP leader Ed Broadbent. Many people think Mr. Turner &quot;looks out of sync&quot; because of his big-business background, says Lorne Nystrom, an NDP member of Parliament.    Hugh Thorburn, a Queen's University political scientist, says he has never seen the Liberal Party so riven but adds he isn't surprised by the party's leftward shift. At election time, he says, the Liberals try to outbid the New Democrats, but when they win they govern more conservatively.    Some political analysts say Mr. Turner, once in office, will soften his stand against the U.S.-Canada trade pact, which still requires approval by the Canadian Parliament and the U.S. Congress. But Mr. Turner has left himself little maneuvering room. Prof. Thorburn calls Mr. Turner's threat to tear up the accord &quot;extremely irresponsible.&quot;    Mr. Turner advocates a much more limited trade arrangement with the U.S. that would free up trade only in certain specified sectors. The existing pact, which is to take effect Jan. 1, would gradually remove all tariffs and many other obstacles to U.S.-Canada trade.    The Liberal leader would take a tough line toward the U.S. on other issues. He wouldn't allow the U.S. to continue testing cruise missiles in northern Canada and would demand a clean-air treaty with the U.S. to deal with transborder pollution blamed for much of Canada's acid rain.    Canada must &quot;make it clear to the U.S. that our cooperation on other issues will be conditional on their cooperation toward the successful completion of such a treaty,&quot; he says. The U.S. and Canada usually try to avoid linking issues to keep their close, complex relationship manageable. </TEXT></DOC>
