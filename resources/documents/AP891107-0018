WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Congress is giving federal agencies ``an openmoney sack'' to hire private consultants and contractors, and theEnergy Department even lets them perform sensitive work on nucleartechnology, a Senate report says.   The Department of Energy relies on private consultants ``toperform virtually all basic governmental functions,'' according toa report released Monday by Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., chairman of aSenate subcommittee.   The number of Energy Department employees has declined from20,000 in 1980 to 16,000, the report said, adding that contractorshave in effect become part of its permanent work force.   ``It relies on contractors in the preparation of its mostimportant plans and policies, the development of budgets and budgetdocuments, and the drafting of reports to Congress andcongressional testimony,'' the report said.   ``It relies on contractors to monitor arms control negotiations,help prepare decisions on the export of nuclear technology, andconduct hearings and initial appeals in challenges to securityclearance disputes,'' it said.   Pryor said the department was unable to say how many contractorsand consultants it has, or how much it is spending on them. But hesaid the department pays more for work by consultants than it wouldfor the same work by employees.   ``We spend in the Congress weeks debating whether governmentemployees should get a 2 percent or a 3.6 percent pay raise, but weprovide literally an open money sack to agencies to hire privatecontractors,'' Pryor said.   Donna R. Fitzpatrick, assistant energy secretary for managementand administration, defended the use of consultants and contractorsas necessary to provide technical expertise that the governmentcannot obtain from its own employees.   She said the department's employees ``are stretched very thin,''and that government salaries are too low to keep employees who canbe hired at higher salaries by the contractors. But she said thedepartment uses only its own employees to make policy decisions.   Fitzpatrick acknowledged the panel's finding that remarks byEnergy Secretary James Watkins to a House panel in April on nuclearfacilities had been written by a private defense contractor, BDM.But she said that was an ``isolated'' incident.   The report was written by the staff of Pryor's SenateGovernmental Affairs subcommittee on federal services, post officeand civil service, which has been looking into use of consultantsby the Energy Department and other agencies.   Pryor said many of the consultants and contractors also dobusiness with private energy companies or foreign governments andcompanies.   ``The potential for a conflict of interest is unchecked,'' hesaid.   David O'Connor, director of procurement and contract managementfor the Environmental Protection Agency, defended EPA's use ofoutside contractors in testimony before the panel. He said EPA'sbudget for contracts tripled during the 1980s.</TEXT></DOC>
