(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Staley Continental Inc., seeking tothwart a $1.42 billion takeover bid by British sugar refiner Tate andamp;Lyle PLC, said Monday it was negotiating with at least one otherparty interested in acquiring part or all of the company.   Staley, the nation's second-largest refiner of corn syrup and aleading producer of food-service supplies, said last week it haddiscussed selling all or part of the company to third parties andexpected to enter into such negotiations.   David Satterfield, a spokesman for Staley, would not identifythe parties.   ``The significance here is that we've commenced negotiations,''he said. ``There is a significant difference between discussionsand negotiations.''   The company also said it would continue to explore other optionsto enhance shareholder value, including a financial restructuringor recapitalization, a joint venture or a leveraged buyout. In aleveraged buyout, the acquirer finances the purchase of the targetcompany with sales of assets of the target or from its cash flow.   Also Monday, Staley officials said the Delaware Chancery Courthad upheld the validity of the company's shareholder-rights planand other measures taken to defend against the Tate andamp; Lyle takeoverbid.   Company officials also said a U.S. District Court in Delawareupheld the constitutionality of the Delaware anti-takeover statuteas it applied to Staley.   Industry analysts have mentioned Chicago-based Kraft Inc. as acompany that may have an interest in acquiring Staley's CFSContinental Inc. food-service division. Staley defeated Kraft in abidding war for CFS Continental in October 1984.   But several analysts refused to speculate Monday on whichcompanies might be talking with Staley.   ``Everything that can be said has been said,'' said Richard Elamof Blunt Ellis andamp; Loewi Inc. ``I'm just waiting for something tooccur that's concrete and palpable, and I don't know what it'sgoing to be.''   Staley's board of directors last week advised the company'sshareholders to reject Tate andamp; Lyle's second cash tender offer,which totals about $1.42 billion, or $35 a share.   Analysts have said Staley has a market value of about $40 ashare.   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Staleyclosed up 50 cents to $38.75 Monday.   London-based Tate andamp; Lyle, Britain's second-largest sugarrefiner, owns about 5 percent of Staley's stock and wants toacquire the entire company for its A.E. Staley Manufacturing Co.subsidiary, which produces corn sweeteners.   Staley was based in Decatur, Ill., until about three years ago,when it moved its headquarters to Rolling Meadows in suburbanChicago.   Tate andamp; Lyle has promised to move Staley's headquarters back toDecatur, in central Illinois, if its takeover attempt succeeds.</TEXT></DOC>
