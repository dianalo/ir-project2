But the U.S. official stressed that the plan for elections amongPalestinian Arabs on the West Bank and in Gaza has the endorsementof the Israeli Cabinet and the Bush administration and stillprovides ``the most realistic way to advance the peace process.''   Boucher called on Palestinians to accept the proposal and to opentalks with Israel `'to flesh out the details of the initiative andto make elections and negotiaqtions work.''   The election would choose Palestinian leaders to negotiatetemporary, local self-rule with Israel. After five years, Israel,Palestinians, Egypt and Jordan would hammer out an overallsettlement.   The conditions set Wednesday by Shamir did not represent anychange in the Israeli leader's position. And the Bush administrationis in accord with one of th major terms _ no Palestinian state to beestablished on Israeli-held territory.   Still, approval of the terms appeared to bind them more tightlyto any negotiations that might be held. They included a statementthat Israel would not give up territory and that Jews could keepsettling on the West Bank and in Gaza.   Ahmed Abdul-Rahman, spokesman for the Palestine LiberationOrganization, said in Tunis that the conditions approved by Shamirand the Likud closed the door to peace.   The PLO official said the nearly 19-month-old uprising byPalestinians against Israeli control would be ``escalated becausethis is the only answer to intransigence.''   But the State Department, through spokesman Boucher, said it wasbasing its policies on the plan approved in May by the IsraeliCabinet and not by ``domestic Israeli politics.''   The statement suggested a U.S. view that Shamir had compromisedwith hard-liners in his party without really changing the proposalitself.</TEXT></DOC>
