 Falcon also has provided trainingand an extended warranty.andM;The maintenance documentation under the command's control amounts to abouthalf a million pages, said Bill Cuneo, the command's technical manuals editorand the project officer in the technical publication system project.andP;  Eachyear, Cuneo and his staff must make revisions to about 15 percent of thedocumentation, he said.andM;Before installing the Macintosh system in January, the command had to hirecontractors to make revisions to its technical maintenance manuals.andP;  Thisprocess proved to be both costly and time consuming, Cuneo said.andP;  The commandis responsible for the documentation on more than 2,000 types of equipment,he said.andM;Falcon proposed the Macintosh IIcx as the basic platform for the Army systemand added full word processing, technical publishing and computer-aideddesign capabilities, Cuneo said.andP;  The Internal Publisher for the Macintosh,from Interleaf Inc. of Cambridge Mass., lies at the heart of the system, hesaid.andM;Heart of the SystemandM;Each of the 54 Macintoshes comes with 8M of RAM, a 100M hard drive and a 40Mtape backup system from Apple.andP;  The system also includes 54 Radius 19-inchcolor monitors from Radius Inc. of San Jose, Calif.; scanners from MicrotekLab Inc. of Gardena, Calif.; and four Varityper VT600P 600-dot-per-inch laserprinters from Varityper Inc. of East Hanover, N.J.andM;In addition to the hardware and peripherals, the system includes WordPerfectCorp.'s WordPerfect for the Macintosh; Illustrator 88 from Adobe Systems Inc.andO;of Mountain View, Calif.; VersaCAD for the Macintosh, computer-sided designsoftware from VersaCAD Corp. of Huntington Beach, Calif.; Digital Darkroomvector tracing and SuperPaint paint software, both from Silicon BeachSoftware Inc. of San Diego.andM;The system also uses Image Studio digital retouching software from LetrasetUSA of Paramus, N.J., and Datacopy Accutext, text scanning and opticalcharacter recognition software from Xerox Imaging Systems Inc. of MountainView, Calif.andM;The system includes the Macintosh version of Oracle Corp.'s Oracle databasemanagement software, Cuneo said.andP;  The command's publication staff will useOracle to create a database of its management information.andM;&quot;We'll use it to create a library of all our information, a management schemefor locating all our data,&quot; Cuneo said.andM;The Oracle system will interact with the command's Equipment PublicationsManagement System.andM;Cuneo said he expects to be able to produce about 40,000 new pages ofdocumentation each year with the new system.andM;Falcon representatives began training the command's 80 system users inJanuary.andP;  The training ended in June.andP;  The publications division already hasproduced about 10,000 to 15,000 pages of documentation using the systems,Cuneo said.andM;&quot;We've produced changes to various technical manuals, covering the gamut ofthe equipment,&quot; he said.andP;  The system will produce new technical manuals butis intended primarily to make changes to existing ones, Cuneo said.andM;All 54 of the Macintoshes are at the command's headquarters.andM;&quot;This system will save us a couple million dollars a year.andP;  &quot;We'll have thewhole system paid back in another month,&quot; Cuneo said, noting that the $1.2million the system costs amounts to almost half of what the command used topay to contractors annually.andP;  Cuneo said he plans to keep the system intactfor at least five years.andM;&quot;We can turn things around much quicker than a contractor,&quot; Cuneo said.andP;  Forinstance, the time it takes the command to put in an emergency change hasdropped from five days under the contracting system, to less than 24 hourswith the Macintoshes, he said.andP;  An emergency change might be required when atechnical manual is found to have a mistake.andM;The Army also has found another benefit of the new system.andP;  The Army rowrequests that all manuals for new equipment be in the form of an &quot;electronicdeliverable,&quot; which can be plugged into the Macintosh system for instantrevision when the need arises.andM;&quot;In the past we'd get camera-ready output and send it to a printer toprocess.andP;  Now we can get an electronic deliverable.andP;  We get the informationon tape or disk, and we're planning to move to optical disk,&quot; Cuneo said.andM;Cuneo also said that the new Macintosh system &quot;will be a central part of ourComputer-Aided Acquisition and Logistics Support solution.andP;  We have thehardware in place, and as we finally go to full CALS we'll just have to getsoftware that conforms to the CALS standard.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
