<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-80-0444 </DOCNO><TEXT>Self-shielding factors of neutron capture cross section have been measuredin the unresolved resonance energy region for Ta-181, U-238 and Th-232,using the standard time-of-flight method at the electron linac facilityof Research Reactor Institute, Kyoto University. The result of Th-232is reported here. A set of transmission and self-indication ratios obtainedfor several transmission samples of different thickness gives a self-shieldingfactor for an arbitrary dilution cross section. Measured self-shieldingfactors are compared with calculations where average resonance parametersare quoted from JENDL-2 and ENDF/B-IV nuclear data files.</TEXT></DOC>
