Reynolds decides how to spendmillions of federal agriculture dollars each year. He implementsfederal policy and sometimes hires or fires a government worker.   Reynolds, however, is neither federal bureaucrat nor politician,but a wheat and corn farmer here in wind-swept Hartley County.   He was elected by his Texas Panhandle neighbors to be chairmanof the three-member committee that runs Hartley County's office ofthe Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service.   Every U.S. county with some agriculture has a three-farmercommittee elected by fellow farmers to direct the local office ofthe ASCS, which runs all the multibillion-dollar federalagriculture payment programs.   It's a job considered unique among government aid programs, withthe very recipients of federal dollars deciding who gets how many.   Potential problems and conflicts are obvious: Would welfaremothers determine their friends' monthly checks or students decideroommates' eligibility for loans? But agriculture officials believethe elected committee members are in the best position to assessfairly the losses suffered by their neighbors _ and to keep themhonest.   ``We have to follow the rules that come down, but we try torepresent the farmer and his needs and what would be best forhim,'' Reynolds said. ``If you don't represent the farmer, who'sgoing to?''   The question of who to protect, the farmer or the government, isat times a difficult one for conscientious committee members. Oneday after Reynolds sided with farmers in an interview, he told areporter he preferred to say committee members have to representboth sides and ``mediate to try to work something out.''   Most committee members interviewed for an Associated Press studyof the 1988 drought relief effort said they voted for the good oftheir neighbors whenever possible.   ``I would say you're representing the farmer _ maybe that's notthe way it's supposed to be,'' said Mike Bouris, chairman of theRiverside, Calif., county committee.   ``You don't want your neighbor to be mad at you because hedidn't qualify,'' said John Rigolizzo Jr., the Camden County, N.J.,committee chairman. ``Yes, you could say he's sticking up for hisbuddy and his neighbor, but when we're in this office, we'regovernment employees.''   Committee members, who are paid small stipends for theirmeetings, take an oath of office pledging to uphold the laws ofCongress. Agriculture Department officials say they expect thecommittees to protect taxpayers as well as be fair to farmers.   ``They represent both, but they have rules and regulations theyhave to obey,'' Dan Shaw, the ASCS deputy administrator in chargeof state and county operations, said from Washington, D.C.   ``They can't just say this is a deprived area so let's take allthe money in the Treasury and throw it out here,'' Shaw said. ``Wefeel peers are the people who can make the really good, accuratedecisions that need to be made.''   Committees have great latitude in administering agricultureprograms, from establishing normal harvests to deciding if a cropwas cultivated properly. They must sometimes analyze farmers'financial standings and sort through corporations, partnerships andtrusts. They also have to interpret an array of laws andregulations.   ``Some guidelines leave a lot for us to interpret. The smartpeople can read that and find ways to get around it,'' said DonGronewald, a hay farmer who is member of the Kaufman County, Texas,committee.   ``All of the programs are good programs, and when they put themout they had good intentions. But you're going to find somebodyabusing and using the program to their benefit, and that makes itharder for the honest Joe,'' Gronewald said.   Agriculture experts say farming in America is so vast that thelocal committee system is the only fair way to administer the aidprograms.   ``There are these glitches. Two counties end up rendering twodifferent decisions,'' said Bob Bergland, agriculture secretaryunder former President Carter. ``But you have to have room forlocal judgment. I'd say it works better than almost any otherscheme you can think of.''   In the case of the drought program, many committees had to setcrop yields and estimate how much would have been harvested in anormal year, as well as decide if a farmer kept his crop properlyfertilized, weeded and, if possible, watered.   And the committees of three had to decide whether each applicantfarmer was eligible.   In some cases, a county committee was more gracious with itsconstituents than either insurance companies evaluating the samelosses or committees in neighboring counties interpreting the sameregulations, the AP found.   A crop insurance company balked at paying one Oklahoma farmer anirrigated yield of 69 bushels per acre on his damaged milo becausehe had watered just once. Insurance paid only the dryland yield of28 bushels. But the county committee granted drought relief basedon the irrigated 69-bushel yield. The farmer received $4,467.   ``The committee made a determination that it was watered,'' saidDavid F. Barnes Jr., director of the Texas County, Okla., ASCSoffice.   The Chaves County, N.M., committee decided to pay a farmer$18,285 for cotton damage caused by ``cold, rainy weather'' and``high winds,'' although the bill contained provision for neitherfreeze-like damage nor wind damage.   The drought relief program was particularly troublesome for somecommittees because it was set up with such haste, officials said.Some farmers harvested their crops before applying for aid, makinglosses difficult to verify.   In Gaines County, Texas, ASCS director John Wayne Hall said hestruggled with 1988 claims for lost winter wheat _ a crop plantedin 1987 and cut months before Congress even considered the droughtlegislation.   ``How can I know what kind of product that boy had out there? Itwas long gone,'' Hall said. ``In '88, we made a lot of judgments.''   A recent General Accounting Office report noted that the 1988relief program was hard to administer because it required countyofficials to determine, on short notice, payments on close to 500crops, from almonds to zucchini. The officials had littleexperience or data on most of tose crops.   ``The program happened awful fast,'' said Steve Verrill,committee chairman in Middlesex County, Mass. ``It was the disasterin the Midwest and everybody, including the politicians, weretalking it up and they were in an awful hurry to get the moneyout.''   Both the elected farmers and the county directors they hire saythe pressure from farmers _ even in more normal years _ can beintense.   ``If I give everybody what they want, I can get along,'' saidHall. ``If I say `Hey, the regulations say you can't do that,' itmakes 'em mad.''   Hall sometimes makes 'em mad anyway.   ``As long as they (the government) pay me, I'll enforce it,'' hesaid.</TEXT><NOTE>NEXT: Keeping North Dakota Alive</NOTE></DOC>
