The bank holding company said the acquisition now must pass a 30-day review by the Justice Department. It said it hopes to complete the acquisition early in the second quarter.    The purchase, for stock, has a current value of $104.8 million. On Dec. 31, United Banks had assets of more than $4.8 billion and IntraWest had assets of $1.2 billion. Both are based in Denver.    To complete the transaction, United Banks agreed to sell its Steamboat Springs bank to a company associated with Western Industrial Bank in Steamboat Springs, and agreed to sell its Montrose bank to local investors. United Banks said both transactions are continuing on schedule. </TEXT></DOC>
