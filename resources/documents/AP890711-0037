Thousands were left without powerand at least 200 people were believed homeless, officials said.   Tornadoes wreaked havoc in two upstate New York towns and a LongIsland village, around three central Massachusetts communities andin northwestern and coastal Connecticut. Twisters, which are unusualin the Northeast, were also reported in northern New Jersey.   Intense thunderstorms boomed over New York's Long Island andWestchester County, producing damaging winds, hail and lightning.Scattered storms also fell over southeastern New York, southernConnecticut and northern New Jersey.   The New York twisters cut a narrow path through the Putnam Countytowns of Carmel and Brewster 30 to 40 miles north of New York City.A separate tornado hit the Long Island village of East Moriches,said Suffolk County fire communications spokesman Jay Sardone.   Two people were treated for cuts from shattered glass and twopeople were injured in separate auto accidents during the storm,said Putnam Hospital Center spokeswoman Marjorie Schneider. One ofthe car crash victims was admitted to the hospital, but his injurieswere not believed to be life threatening; the others were treatedand released.   Both the Putnam and Long Island hospitals were operating onemergency generators.   About 10,000 Long Island Lighting Co. customers were withoutpower, the utility reported. ``It's a complete wipeout,'' saidutility spokeswoman Sue Roschak.   A tornado tore off roofs and walls in a 250-unit condominiumdevelopment in Carmel, severely damaging 35 homes and damaging 35others, said Putnam County spokesman Ken Lott. Red Cross spokesmanLarry Mackler estimated 200 people were left homeless.   ``You're looking at these condos and the front walls are justgone,'' said Eric Gross, a reporter for radio station WVIP who livesin Carmel.   ``You can look in and see their furniture on the second floor,''he said. ``People told me they heard this horrible wind, lookedoutside their windows, grabbed their kids and ran into the basement.There are trees, five, six and seven feet in diameter that snappedlike matchsticks. Cars overturned and others were crushed.''   Gross, who was on the outskirts of Carmel when the tornado hit,said the storm lasted no more than two minutes.   The Red Cross set up an emergency shelter at Carmel High Schoolwith 200 cots, but virtually no one had gone to the shelter by earlyTuesday. People either stayed at the development to keep watch ontheir property or stayed with friends and relatives, Lott said.   Hundreds of Putnam County homes were without power and utilitycrews were out working on downed power lines, said spokesman MarkWelte of New York State Electric andamp; Gas, which serves the area.   The Long Island tornado roared through a private airport,demolishing a trailer that housed a skydiving school and injuring aman inside. A small airplane was destroyed and several were damaged.The man was hospitalized in good condition.   In central Massachusetts, a series of ``mini-tornadoes'' knockedout power and telephones, felled trees and damaged homes in thePrinceton, Steling and West Boylston areas.   Most of the damage, however, was in woods, said Tom Holmes, chiefmeteorologist at the National Weather Service's Worcester station.   No injuries were reported.   About half of West Boylston, a town of about 6,000 people, waswithout electricity or phone service.   More than 3,000 people in western Massachusetts were also withoutpower, said John Gustavsen of Northeast Utilities.   Mini-tornados are small tornados 50 to 100 feet in length thattouch down briefly. Holmes termed the storm a ``super-thunderstorm.''   In 1953, a tornado in Worcester and surrounding areas killed 90people.   In Connecticut, tornadoes were reported in Bantam in the state'snorthwest corner and in the New Haven and Hamden areas, where themayors declared states of emergency. Heavy rain and golfball-sizehail fell in some areas.   Waterbury Mayor Joseph Santopietro imposed a 10 p.m. curfew tokeep curious townspeople from hampering the storm cleanup. The cityalso opened a shelter at Kennedy High School for those whose homeswere damaged.   At least five homes in Hamden were destroyed and an industrialpark damaged when a tornado wound through the town around 5:30 p.m.,police said.   A 12-year-old girl was killed when a tree fell on the tent shewas in at Black Rock State Park in Watertown in west centralConnecticut, state police said. Three other girls in the tent, partof a church group from Stratford, were injured and taken tohospitals in Waterbury.   Thirty-seven people were treated in New Haven hospitals or minorinjuries, and 27 people were treated at Waterbury Hospital formostly minor injuries, although several people suffered brokenbones, officials said.   More than 112,000 people in northwestern and southern Connecticutwere without power, said spokesmen for Northeast Utilities andUnited Illuminating.   ``Every crew we have is on the road and then some,'' said UnitedIlluminating spokesman Robert Fort, who estimated it would take 24hours to restore power to all customers.   Some the approximately 600 National Guardsmen on duty Mondaynight were dispatched to Hamden and Waterbury to help assess thedamage, said Jon Sandberg, a spokesman for Gov. William A. O'Neill.   In northern New Jersey, twisters left behind downed electricalwires and fallen trees, but no injuries were reported.</TEXT></DOC>
