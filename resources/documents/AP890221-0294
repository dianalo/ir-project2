In the survey released Tuesday, 84 percent of the respondentssaid they believed mergers and acquisitions take place in a corruptenvironment, and two-thirds said the government should place morerestrictions on leveraged buyouts. In a leveraged buyout, investorsbuy a company with largely borrowed funds, and then pay off theloans with the company's cash flow or by selling its assets.   The survey, conducted for the National Law Journal and Lexis, acomputerized legal data base operated by the information firm MeadData Central, polled 808 people between Jan. 28 and 30. During thattime, two congressional committees were holding hearings intopossibly restricting LBOs.   Public awareness of and concern about LBOs have increased inrecent months as a result of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co.'s record$24.53 buyout of RJR Nabisco Inc.   In the survey, which has a margin of error of 3.5 percentagepoints, 32 percent of the respondents endorsed restructuring taxlaws to make it more difficult for LBOs to be accomplished, a stepthat has received support in Congress and the Bush administration.   Twenty-four percent of the respondents said consumers are hurtthe most by takeovers. Fifty-four percent said employees are hurtthe most, but one-third also said the gretest benefit of takeoveractivity was the creation of new jobs.   More than one-fifth of the respondents said they or a member oftheir immediate family had worked for a company that was involved ina takeover in the last three years. Of that group, almost 50 percentreported negative consequences of the takeover, including the lossof a job.</TEXT></DOC>
