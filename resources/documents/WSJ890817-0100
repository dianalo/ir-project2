The department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration proposed broadening and stiffening existing requirements, and updating them to encourage the use of newer equipment. The proposal covers helmets, face guards, eyeglasses, safety shoes and other equipment.    OSHA also proposed requiring employers to assess hazards in their workplaces that would necessitate such equipment, and to train workers in its use.    OSHA said it wants to encourage innovation in equipment and to make it easier for employers to accept the equipment and more likely that employees will use it. Newer, more comfortable equipment is available that would encourage more use, OSHA said.    OSHA noted that its existing standards for protective equipment date back to 1971 and 1972; they include requirements for men's safety shoes, for example, but there are no requirements for women's shoes. The proposals are based partly on new standards issued by the American National Standards Institute, a private group.    The agency estimated that increased compliance with existing regulations could eliminate 82,800 of the 411,000 annual injuries caused by failure to use proper equipment. It said the new rules could prevent another 41,000 injuries. Either better compliance or the new rules would save six lives a year, OSHA added.    The agency estimated the annual cost of full compliance with existing rules at $65.3 million, and the added cost of complying with the proposed new ones at $28.3 million. The proposal covers general industry but excludes construction, maritime and agriculture, for which OSHA generally has fewer regulations.    The National Safety Council has estimated that eye, head, face and foot injuries represented 13.8% of a total of roughly 1.8 million disabling work injuries in 1987.    OSHA gave interested parties until Oct. 16 to comment on the proposed rules before it decides whether to hold hearings and whether to adopt the proposal. </TEXT></DOC>
