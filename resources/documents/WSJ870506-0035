The House voted to proceed with deliberations on a bill that would freeze the military budget, but will consider dozens of amendments to alter various military programs. The Senate Armed Services Committee, meanwhile, approved a budget of $303.3 billion, considerably higher than the House bill but still $8.6 billion less than the $312 billion proposed by the administration.    Both measures are subject to further changes. Moreover, the two chambers then will face the task of reconciling major differences in their bills. For example, the Senate version would provide $4.5 billion for the Strategic Defense Initiative, while the House would authorize $3.6 billion. Also, the House would cut all funds for the Bigeye chemical bomb, while the Senate would provide $5 million to begin production of the weapon.    Meanwhile, the Senate panel voted to delay the development of the Army's planned LHX helicopter and to terminate production of the Grumman Corp. A-6 attack planes. The Navy had requested $970 million to purchase 18 of the planes.    The House bill would fund both programs, but at lower levels than the Pentagon proposed. Grumman, based in Bethpage, N.Y., plans a vigorous fight to keep the A-6 program.    The two chambers also are far apart on funding for anti-satellite weapons. The House would provide $50 million, while the Senate would authorize $284 million for such weapons.    The Senate panel voted $1.2 billion for the MX missile, plus $400 million to research a plan to base the 10-warhead weapon on rail cars. In addition, the panel provided $700 million for development of the mobile Midgetman missile.    The Senate panel increased funding for special operations, which include such groups as the Army Green Berets and secret counterterrorist units. It voted $980.7 million for airplanes for special-operations groups, $171.2 million higher than the administration's request.    The Senate panel also voted additional funds for updating conventional-weapons systems. It provided $300 million for new technologies in systems such as anti-tank weapons, and it directed shifting another $200 million from other research and development projects to support such programs.    In addition, the Senate bill would authorize initial work on a new nuclear-materials-production reactor that is expected to cost $3 billion to $5 billion.    Energy Department spokesman Phil Kief said the measure would provide $20 million for planning and design. The money would come from savings derived from keeping closed the agency's N-reactor at Hanford, Wash., the Armed Services Committee said.    The reactor has been shut down for $50 million in safety improvements called for after the Chernobyl nuclear accident. But some nuclear scientists and many lawmakers contend the work on the N-reactor won't adequately cure its safety drawbacks.    The Reagan administration, which had resisted suggestions that it needs to seek funds for a new defense reactor, reversed its position last week. Energy Secretary John Herrington quietly wrote to the Senate panel asking for the funding &quot;in order to provide an assured source of nuclear materials in the long term to maintain our nuclear deterrent.&quot; At the same time, Mr. Herrington is fighting for the reopening of the N-reactor.    Even if the N-reactor is able to reopen, it will have to be replaced or extensively overhauled in the early or mid-1990s when the expanding graphite that moderates its chain reaction is expected to bump up against its roof. </TEXT></DOC>
