Officials said five policemen were treated in hospitals forinjuries and one protester was slightly injured.   As the government held its own parade and rally nearby, thedemonstrators clashed with about 2,000 police clad in riot gear andbacked by water cannons and barbed-wire barricades.   The clashes failed to disrupt the parade and rally, which wereheld to mark the 1911 uprising that led to the fall of China's lastdynasty, the Qing. An estimated 250,000 spectators were on hand.   President Lee Teng-hui briefly addressed the rally, which wasattended by dignitaries from 40 countries.   The demonstrators, waving flag poles and sticks, tried to breakthrough human walls formed by police.   Riot police with shields and truncheons charged them, but theprotesters quickly regrouped to confront the officers again.Television footage showed a man in a yellow shirt running close tothe police line and lobbing a large rock into their midst.   The police charged the man and he fell. Another shot showedblood staining the back of a protester as he was helped away by afriend.   In the afternoon, about 2,000 riot police blocked all threeintersections leading to the jail where dissident publisher HsuHsin-liang is being held.   About 10,000 protesters, wearing yellow headbands, waved bannersthat read ``Release Hsu Hsin-liang.''   Hsu, 48, was jailed in the Taipei suburb of Tucheng after hereturned to Taiwan from the United States in a fishing boat lastmonth. He was wanted by the government for his alleged role inorganizing a 1979 anti-government demonstration in which hundredswere injured.   Hsu and four other executives from the Formosa magazine werecharged with trying to topple the Nationalist government byorganizing the demonstration. Hsu left for the United Statesshortly before the 1979 riot. The other four men were convicted ofsedition and released after serving part of their lengthy jailterms.   Chen Wan-chen, the organizer of today's protest, said thedemonstrators wanted to appeal to Lee to release politicalprisoners.   The detainees include Hsu and two other prisoners who wereconvicted of sedition and sentenced to lengthy jail terms in 1987.All three were accused of advocating that Taiwan no longer consideritself part of China _ an act the Nationalists consider seditious.</TEXT></DOC>
