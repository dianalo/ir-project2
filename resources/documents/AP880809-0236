The increase in the discount rate, to 6.5 percent from 6percent, was made ``to reduce inflationary pressures (and) ... inlight of the growing spread of market interest rates over thediscount rate,'' according to the Fed.   Many economists predicted other interest rates, including thoseon mortgages or home-equity loans, would rise as a result of theFed's credit tightening. And a few market watchers worried aboutthe near-term effects on the already skittish stock market.   The increase in the discount-rate _ the fee the central bankcharges member banks for loans _ was the second since AlanGreenspan replaced Paul A. Volcker at the Fed's helm a year ago. OnSept. 4, the central bank raised the rate for the first time inthree years, to 6 percent from 5.5 percent.   While last September's increase in the rate also was taken inresponse to inflationary fears, analysts later cited it as acontributing factor to the Oct. 19 stock market crash.   ``I just hope history doesn't repeat itself,'' said IrwinKellner, chief economist for Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. ``Idon't look for a market collapse but the cross-currents of thestock market aren't very favorable. It certainly is dangerous.''   On Wall Street, stock prices fell sharply in response to theannouncement, with the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials losingslightly more than 28 points to 2,079.13. It had been down nearly40 points late in the day.   Bond prices tumbled while interest rates rose. The Treasury'sbellwether 30-year issue was off about $10 per $1,000 face amount,while its yield jumped to 9.19 percent from 9.10 percent lateMonday.   In foreign exchange, the dollar advanced strongly against majorcurrencies. Higher interest rates make the dollar more valuable.   The biggest increases came against the Japanese yen and WestGerman marks. By late afternoon Tuesday, the dollar had brokenthrough the psychologically important 135-yen level from Monday'sNew York close of 133.97, and to 1.92 marks from 1.90.   Analysts had expected the Fed to tighten its reins on the moneysupply this week, but few were expecting an increase in thediscount rate, which is the most dramatic move the Fed can take.   Tuesday's increase brings the discount rate to its steepestlevel since April 1986, when it fell to 6.5 percent from 7 percent.   ``The (credit) markets have been screaming for a discount rateincrease for quite some time; the surprise was in the timing ofit,'' said Kellner.   ``Not only is the Republican convention coming up, but we're inthe middle of a Treasury refunding,'' in which the government isauctioning off $22 billion in new three- and 10-year notes thisweek to pay off its old debts.   ``I don't think inflation is any worse today than it was lastyear,'' said Kellner.   But Robert A. Brusca, chief financial economist for NikkoSecurities Co. International Inc., defended the discount rate hike.   ``The economy has been doing well but inflation has ben creepingup,'' he said. ``It's the Fed's job to throw cold water on theeconomy when it starts overheating and that's what it appears to bedoing right now.''   Among the recent signs of strength in the economy was the Julyunemployment rate, which at 5.4 percent was near its 14-year lows.   Concerns about inflation have pushed interest rates higher inrecent months. The federal funds rate, which is the interest onovernight loans between banks, has been on the rise. Elizabeth G.Reiners, an economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said the yieldspread between the fed funds rate and discount rate had been at itshighest level in about a year.   A month ago, major banks boosted their prime lending rates, ahalf percentage point to 9.5 percent from 9 percent.   ``I wouldn't be surprised if we had another prime rate hike byFriday,'' said David Resler, chief economist Nomura Securities Inc.</TEXT></DOC>
