Despite some differences, all 11 voting members of theFed's open market committee agreed that the softening economycalled for cutting rates immediately and for tilting towardlower rates in the following weeks, according to a summary ofthe Nov. 13 meeting.</LP><TEXT>   The Fed pushed down the federal funds rate, the rates thatbanks charge on loans to each other, by 1/4 percentage pointafter the meeting and by another 1/4 percentage point inearly December.   Following a meeting of the committee last week, the Fedpushed down the fed funds rate by another 1/4 percentagepoint, bringing it to about 7%. Also last week, the Fed cutthe discount rate, the rate it charges on loans to banks, by1/2 percentage point to 6.5%. The Fed will release a summaryof last week's deliberations in February.   In mid-November, Fed economists were projecting &quot;a milddownturn,&quot; but they anticipated that economic growth wouldresume during the first six months of 1991. Not all the Fedpolicy makers were so optimistic, though. &quot;Many of the{committee} members noted that, while the most likely outcomewas a relatively mild and brief downturn, there were risks ofa more severe or prolonged contraction,&quot; the summary said.   One continuing concern was the credit crunch or, as theFed put it, &quot;the increased reluctance of institutionallenders to accommodate less-than-prime business borrowers.&quot;Also figuring in the decision was weaker-than-anticipatedgrowth in the money supply.   The summary said that a &quot;few&quot; of the committee memberswere urging the Fed to move gingerly. Though they werewilling to ease credit conditions slightly, they werereluctant to give Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan leeway to makea second move toward lower rates. Still, those who hadobjected earlier in the year to easing credit conditions,including Fed governor Wayne Angell and Cleveland Fedpresident Lee Hoskins, didn't dissent.   The voting members of the Fed's open-market committee arethe six current Fed governors and five of the 12 district Fedbank presidents. The other seven presidents participate inthe discussions.</TEXT></DOC>
