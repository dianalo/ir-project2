The accusation came as Gorbachev welcomed President Reagan tothe Moscow summit with an appeal to end nuclear testing andpreserve the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which would limitthe president's Star Wars plan for a space-based missile defensesystem.   Reagan responded that U.S. and Soviet negotiators are makingprogress toward a treaty reducing strategic weapons by as much as50 percent. Citing other joint efforts to ease East-West tensions,the president said that ``our work has begun to produce results.''   Yevgeny Velikhov, vice president of the Soviet Academy ofSciences, told reporters that American negotiators had rejectedKremlin proposals to ease the two countries' impasse over Star Warsand verify limits on submarine-launched cruise missiles.   The two issues are among the main obstacles to the proposedSTART or Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty being negotiated by U.S.and Soviet experts in Geneva. Defense Secretary Frank Carluccidismissed any attempt to link Star Wars to progress on a STARTagreement.   National Security Adviser Colin Powell held out little hope ofcompleting a treaty before Reagan leaves office next January.   Velikhov, who has advised Gorbachev on the Star Wars issue, saidthe Americans had rejected a Soviet proposal to discuss what typesof testing could be permitted under the 1972 ABM accord.   That treaty limits each side to a missile defense at one site.The joint statement issued after the Reagan-Gorbachev summit inWashington last December said both sides would be allowed to test``as required.'' The United States said that allows tests ofpotential Star Wars weapons but the Soviets disagree.   Velikhov said that ``within the framework of the Decemberstatement, we need to settle some technical questions.'' But hecharged that ``the Americans want to destroy the treaty.''   If the United States deploys ``a nationwide defense, it willviolate the (ABM) treaty, and jeopardizes effort to cut strategicoffensive weapons,'' Velikhov said.   The two sides also agreed in December to negotiate ceilings onsubmarine-launched nuclear missiles, but not to include them in the6,000-warhead limit proposed for the strategic weapons treaty.   The Soviets, said Velikhov, have proposed monitoring thepresence of nuclear warheads on submarine-launched cruise missilesusing devices to detect neutron and gamma-ray emissions.   American officials have rejected that idea. They say it would betoo easy to bypass such devices and that they oppose allowingSoviet inspectors to board American submarines for on-siteverification of any limits on the missiles.   Gorbachev told Reagan that ``it is incumbent on us to discussconstructively the main aspects of disarmament: the set of issuesrelated to 50 percent cuts in strategic offensive arms, whilepreserving the 1972 ABM treaty, problems of eliminating chemicalweapons, reductions in armed forces and conventional armaments inEurope, cessation of nuclear testing.''   U.S. officials have repeatedly rejected Gorbachev`s appeals foran end to nuclear testing, and refused to join an 18-month Soviettesting moratorium.   White House chief of staff Howard Baker said on NBC-TV's ``Meetthe Press'' show that there could be a fifth summit meeting beforeReagan leaves office next January, but ``only if the two sidesreach agreement in START talks.''   Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev, chief of the Soviet general staff,said the two countries might be able to strike a START deal by theend of Reagan's second term.   ``My own personal opinion is that we've covered more than halfthe ground,'' Akhromeyev said in an ABC-TV interview here.   Powell said Reagan ``would certainly like to see the STARTtreaty completed during his term. The broad outlines are there. ...We're now down in the trenches working out the very difficultissues having to do with verification'' and cruise and mobilemissiles.   ``I would like to see some progress this week and progress ispossible, but there is a lot of hard work ahead,'' Powell said.   Georgi A. Arabatov, a Soviet government adviser on Americanaffairs, said on ``Meet the Press'' that Gorbachev ``will welcomeany step towards agreement and if there is an opportunity to havean agreement before the term of President Reagan expires, he wouldbe very glad.''   Powell said agreement on a joint verification experiment for anuclear test ban, which seemed doubtful Saturday, ``may be back inthe cards'' for signing at the Moscow summit.   Carlucci, in an interview with Cable News Network, said``progress is being made'' also on a peaceful nuclear explosivestreaty, although Powell said it wouldn't be ready for signing atthe summit.</TEXT></DOC>
