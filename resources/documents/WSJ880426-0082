The measure, approved 48-30, represents a compromise on rival House and Senate bills. The House is expected soon to approve the legislation, which is estimated to cost $36 million for the year beginning Oct. 1.    Under the bill, the conditions of veterans who developed any of 12 types of cancer within 40 years of their exposure or developed leukemia within 30 years, would be presumed to be the result of military service. About 250,000 members of the military were exposed during nuclear tests in the 1940s and during the occupation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, where the U.S. dropped nuclear bombs, lawmakers said.    Currently, any of those veterans with cancer may receive disability benefits if they can prove their conditions resulted from service-related exposure. Of about 6,000 such claims filed, 40 have been approved, according to Alan Cranston (D., Calif.), chairman of a Senate veterans committee and the bill's sponsor.    The Reagan administration opposes the measure, saying it presumes a connection between cancer and the service-related exposure to radiation without scientific proof. </TEXT></DOC>
