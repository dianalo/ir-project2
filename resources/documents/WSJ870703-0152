The firm dollar was a catalyst for some of the gains, but most market increases were spurred by local factors.    The recent slump in Tokyo shares led to bargain-hunting in financial issues and stocks dependent on exports, and that, in turn, led to a broad rally. The Nikkei stock average surged 384.08 points to 24636.46 as volume expanded to 950 million shares from 850 million shares Wednesday. Gainers outnumbered losers, 698 to 279.    Export-led shares also got a boost from the relative strength of the dollar, which traded around 146.93 yen. Otherwise, market participants said, there weren't any new factors to influence trading.    In Hong Kong, gains in Hong Kong Land spurred a rally in the rest of the market. The stock rose 30 Hong Kong cents to 7.45 Hong Kong dollars (95 cents) on unconfirmed rumors of a buyout by Japanese interests. The Hang Seng index jumped 65.16 points to a record 3229.15.    Sydney stocks climbed sharply as share price index futures contracts shot up for the second consecutive session. At one point, the premium of the futures contracts over the All Ordinaries index was at a record. The index ended up 26.0 points at 1800.0. Dealers said they were surprised at the sharp gains and couldn't identify the sources of the strong buying or the reasons for it. Some speculated foreigners were buying futures contracts as a way of gaining broad exposure to the Australian market.    Singapore shares also ended higher, though trading was moderate. Certain blue-chip industrial and financial shares were in heavy demand.    In Europe, stock prices closed higher in London, Frankfurt, Brussels, Paris, Zurich, Amsterdam and Stockholm.    London stocks broke out of their lethargy, with the 100-share index up 27.6 points to 2297.4. It was the biggest gain in the index since a 40.02-point rise June 12, the day after the Conservative election victory.    The Financial Times 30-share index surged 22.5 points to 1794.6. Volume increased to 687 million shares from 642.1 million Wednesday.    The widespread gains reflected revived interest from domestic institutions following a lull around the end of the first half, dealers said. In addition, the pound's stability in recent days has spawned hopes for renewed interest from foreign investors, dealers said, although they reported few signs of foreign buying.    Another factor was a shortage of stock in leading companies, which sparked strong early markups by market-makers. Those gains triggered institutional buying, dealers said.    Shares posting strong gains included pharmaceuticals, oils, food retailers and stores. Banks and property issues were mostly lower.    Frankfurt shares also broke out, ending broadly higher in active trading after losses earlier this week.    Brokers said investors have digested the news of electronics group Siemens's earnings decline in fiscal 1987 and have turned again to the market's strong fundamentals.    Siemens broke a three-day slide that cut the share's market value 7.7% by rising 4.9 marks to 690.5 marks ($377.90). Brokers said the issue probably will soon trade above 700 marks again despite news that fiscal 1987 earnings will decline from 1.47 billion marks ($804.5 million) a year earlier.    The rise of the dollar to the upper end of its current trading range between 1.82 marks and 1.83 marks gave the market a further boost, brokers said.    Foreign and domestic institutional investors snapped up blue-chip equities, concentrating on stocks in the auto and chemical sectors.    Bayerische Motoren Werke jumped 28 marks to 697 marks; company officials denied reports that the Quandt family, BMW's main shareholder, is about to sell a stake to a foreign auto company.    Volkswagen rose 7.4 marks to 418.9 marks after the company's announcement of a small earnings increase in the first half. Daimler-Benz was up seven marks to 1,097 marks. The company said Wednesday that first-half group sales were up 1% to 31.5 billion marks.    In Brussels, surging share prices pushed up the Stock Index 49.39 points to a record 4829.61. The index had set six consecutive records before falling a bit Tuesday and Wednesday.    Dealers said the foreign buying that has focused mostly on blue-chip issues in recent sessions spread across the market. Traders were surprised by the extent of the gains because there haven't been any major corporate or economic events to spur the market.    &quot;The foreign buying has been accumulating and apparently a lot of orders coincided,&quot; one dealer said.    Shares in Paris were higher on bargain-hunting and a drop in French interest rates. Demand from foreign investors was particularly strong, dealers said. The dollar's firmness helped food shares and other export-oriented issues that had come under selling pressure earlier in the week.    The firm dollar also boosted prices in Zurich and encouraged selective buying by foreign and domestic investors, dealers said. Some financial, chemical and other industrial stocks had the biggest gains. Banks also ended mostly higher.    Amsterdam prices recovered from a bout of profit-taking earlier this week to close higher. But dealers said trading remained selective, with overseas buyers, led by U.S. and British investors, focusing on a few blue-chip issues.    In Stockholm, prices rose in light trading and remained in the same narrow range of the last two weeks. Engineering, forestry and real estate and construction companies had the biggest gains.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end.                                                       % This                                    Jul 1    Jun 30    Year   U.S. .......................... 282.4     283.6   + 23.8   Britain ....................... 681.9     686.1   + 37.0   Canada ........................ 415.6     415.6   + 24.7   Japan ........................ 1215.7    1215.1   + 28.7   France ........................ 411.3     411.0   +  0.8   Germany ....................... 227.9     231.9   - 12.3   Hong Kong .................... 2262.3    2276.4   + 27.2   Switzerland ................... 188.2     190.3   -  6.3   Australia ..................... 332.2     330.3   + 25.9   World index ................... 458.2     459.2   + 28.4</TEXT></DOC>
