<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-96-1002 </DOCNO><TEXT>One component of the neutron source associated with the decay of actinidenuclides in many environments is due to the interaction of decay {alpha}particles in ({alpha},n) reactions on low Z nuclides. Measurements of({alpha},n) thick target neutron yields and associated neutron spectrahave been made for only a few combinations of {alpha} energy and targetnuclide or mixtures of actinide and target nuclides. Calculations ofthick target neutron yields and spectra with the SOURCES code require{alpha}-energy-dependent cross sections for ({alpha},n) reactions, aswell as branching fractions leading to the energetically possible levelsof the product nuclides. A library of these data has been accumulatedfor target nuclides of Z {le} 15 using that available from measurementsand from recent GNASH code calculations. SOURCES, assuming neutrons tobe emitted isotopically in the center-of-mass system, uses librariesof {alpha} stopping cross sections, ({alpha},n) reaction cross reactions,product nuclide level branching fractions, and actinide decay {alpha}spectra to calculate thick target ({alpha},n) yields and neutron spectrafor homogeneous combinations of nuclides. The code also calculates thethick target yield and angle intergrated neutron spectrum produced by{alpha}-particle beams on targets of homogeneous mixtures of nuclides.Illustrative calculated results are given and comparisons are made withmeasured thick target yields and spectra. 50 refs., 1 fig., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
