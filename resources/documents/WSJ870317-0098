As a result, it is targeting a growing proportion of its oil expenditures abroad, though total capital and exploration spending has been sharply reduced since 1985.    Lawrence G. Rawl, Exxon's chairman and chief executive officer, describes the U.S. as a &quot;mature&quot; oil province. &quot;The industry in this country is about 125 years old, and that's a long time in one geological setting with all the wells we have drilled,&quot; he says, noting that today's unexplored areas are largely outside the U.S.    His views are shared by many other American oil executives who have been directing much of their companies' search for petroleum outside the heavily drilled U.S. since last year's oil-price collapse. But Exxon's moves, monitored closely by others in the industry because of the company's size, can have a bigger impact than those of other oil concerns.    A year ago, after oil prices plunged, Exxon began reducing capital and exploration spending. In 1986, such expenditures totaled $7.2 billion, down from nearly $10.8 billion in 1985. Foreign spending related to energy was cut less than domestic spending, however. Energy-related foreign expenditures fell $1 billion, to $3.9 billion, in 1986. Domestic energy-related expenditures dropped $2.5 billion, to $2.8 billion. For this year, world-wide capital and exploration expenditures are budgeted at $6.5 billion.    Exxon's biggest cuts have been in U.S. exploration and production operations. The drop in domestic drilling by Exxon, formerly the premier U.S. wildcatter, is indicative of the changes. At year-end 1985, Exxon was participating in the drilling of 453 oil and gas wells world-wide, including 323 in the U.S. At year-end 1986, it is understood that the number of wells being drilled in which Exxon participated was down 52% world-wide and 63% in the U.S.    &quot;We're a high-cost country now, not only in terms of (oil) production costs but also exploration costs,&quot; says Mr. Rawl. He says he doubts that there are any more giant oil fields to be found in the U.S. -- certainly none the size of Prudhoe Bay, which was discovered in 1968 by Exxon and Atlantic Richfield Co. on Alaska's North Slope. &quot;Not only Exxon and the industry but the politicians and the planners and everybody else ought to recognize where we are in the life cycle&quot; of the U.S. as an oil province, Mr. Rawl says.    But Exxon &quot;will continue to do our fair share of the exploration in this country,&quot; the Exxon chief says. &quot;And,&quot; Mr. Rawl adds, &quot;I see a lot more potential in the U.S. for natural gas.&quot;    Natural gas currently accounts for about one-half of Exxon's proved oil and gas reserves of 15.1 billion barrels, as measured in the oil equivalent. But because of the company's vast natural gas holdings both at home and abroad, Lee R. Raymond, president, says Exxon should become more of a gas than an oil company in the years ahead.    Similarly, he says, Exxon will become more of a coal company because of its large coal resources. Eventually, synthetic fuels including shale oil will also emerge as a factor in the company's energy mix. Meantime, Mr. Raymond says, &quot;We are probably going to become more of an international company.&quot;    Exxon, of course, has been international for many decades. One of the Seven Sisters -- as the biggest international oil companies were known -- it was aggressively exploring for petroleum abroad even in the 1950s and 1960s, when U.S. oil producers seemed to be drowning in a sea of domestic oil. Today, Exxon's units or affiliates are leading oil operators in Canada, Europe, the North Sea, Australia, Malaysia and other Pacific Rim countries.    In the U.S., Exxon produces about 800,000 barrels a day of liquid hydrocarbons. World-wide it produces 1.8 million barrels a day, refines three million barrels a day and markets, as petroleum products, four million barrels a day. Its world-wide output of natural gas exceeds five billion cubic feet a day.    Other companies also have reduced spending in the U.S., many more sharply than Exxon. But, according to Petroleum Information Corp., which tracks well results across the U.S., Exxon ranked No. 1 among leading U.S. operators in 1985 by drilling a total of 1,073 oil and gas wells. Last year, according to the Petroleum Information tabulations, Exxon slipped to No. 3 with 558 wells drilled. In wildcat explorations seeking entirely new oil fields, the company reported, Exxon fell from No. 1 in 1985 with 118 wells drilled to No. 2 in 1986 with only 52 wildcat wells.    For example, along with other oil concerns, Exxon had been spending heavily searching for oil in the Bering Basin and the Beaufort Sea off the coast of Alaska. By 1986, Mr. Rawl says, it was apparent after 33 straight dry holes &quot;that the source rock wasn't very attractive.&quot; Exxon drilled 11 of the dry holes at a cost of more than $1 billion.    Mr. Rawl says Exxon continues to hold its leases in many areas, even though the resources may be non-commercial at today's oil prices. A &quot;significant restructuring of everybody's exploration budgets in 1986&quot; would have taken place in the U.S. even if the price of oil hadn't plunged, Mr. Rawl adds. </TEXT></DOC>
