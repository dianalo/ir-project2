Woods, a white South African journalist forced to flee thecountry in 1978, also said on Monday that he suspectedright-wingers close to the government planted three bombs incinemas to disrupt screenings Friday.   ``There are people on the fringes of the security police who canbe relied upon to do this sort of thing if they get the nod,''Woods told The Associated Press in an interview.   No one was hurt in the three bombings and many white SouthAfricans saw the film before the government seized all copies,several hours after it began showing at 30 cinemas.   Here for a Commonwealth foreign ministers' meeting on counteringSouth African censorship and propaganda, Woods said he neverexpected ``Cry Freedom'' to be shown in South Africa.   The movie tells the story of his friendship with black activistSteve Biko, who died in police custody in 1977.   ``The fact it was shown even for two showings was a bungle. Theyhad been counting on the censorship people reversing theirdecision. When that failed, they were counting on the cinemamanagers to chicken out. When they refused, the government decidedto send in the police,'' said Woods. ``I'm surprised at theineptitude.   ``South Africans are normally unaware of the extent to whichtheir media are censored. But when there's all kinds of controversyabout a film and they see the government crudely taking the filmsaway, that's the most blatant form of censorship and evennon-politicized people might be politicized by that.''   He said South Africans who have seen the movie were staggered.``It's the truth of it that hits them _ to actually see thingsthey've known in their gut were going on,'' Woods said.   He hoped the eight Commonwealth ministers, who meet Tuesday andWednesday under the chairmanship of Canadian Foreign Minister JoeClark, would decide to finance an underground press in South Africaand set up a radio service outside the country to disseminateuncensored news.   Woods said unsigned news reports could be carried out bycouriers to London or Paris and distributed, provided they aremonitored by credible experts.   Asked if he had been asked to play such a role, Woods, 54, said:``I'd rather not say at this stage.''   He will moderate a public forum on South African propaganda onTuesday.   Calling on Canada to take the political lead, Woods said hewants Western nations to sever diplomatic relations with Pretoriabut to maintain indirect links through the black front-line states,such as Lesotho, Botswana, Zimbabwe and Swaziland.   ``There's a myth that white South Africans only get tougher ifyou lean on them,'' Woods said. ``If every South African travelerabroad had to go to Lesotho or Botswana, that would concentratetheir minds.''   The Commonwealth summit in Vancouver in October asked theforeign ministers' panel to review the fight against apartheid. Theministers are from Australia, Canada, Guyana, India, Nigeria,Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Britain declined, because PrimeMinister Margaret Thatcher opposes tougher sanctions againstPretoria.   Woods said Mrs. Thatcher cannot indefinitely defy Commonwealth,European Community and post-election U.S. pressure. ``She'll end upU-turning just as she did in 1978 over Rhodesia becoming Zimbabwe.''   Canada has organized an arts festival, a City Hall exhibition ofphotos and posters banned in South Africa, and a lakefrontcandle-lighting ceremony in conjunction with the meeting. Torontoresidents were asked to show their opposition to apartheid bylighting candles in their windows.</TEXT></DOC>
