Bone scintigraphy was positive in 30 of 42patients (83 lesions), while radiography and symptoms were positive in23 patients (48 lesions), and in 29 patients (44 lesions) respectively.Bone scintigraphy was positive in many lesions with negative radiographyor symptoms. However, approximately half of the lesions in which eitherradiography or symptoms was positive could not be detected by bone scintigraphy.These cases mostly showed radiographic abnormalities such as irregularcalcified areas and ''bone island'' in the cervical regions of the humerus,femur and tibia. Both bone scintigraphy and radiography were positivein most of the patients with symptoms of the bends and there seems tobe a close relationship between the bends symptoms and bone lesion. Weconcluded that bone scintigraphy is useful for the evaluation of decompressionsickness, but it must be complemented by bone radiography to avoid asignificant number of false negative cases.</TEXT></DOC>
