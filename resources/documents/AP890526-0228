Still to be resolved are major differences over wages and acompany demand that workers pay more for health care.   ``We are not as far apart as we were but we're nowhere nearwhere we want to be,'' Ms. Zucker said.   The company, moving to answer some of the unions' job-securityconcerns, amended its contract offer to include limits on the useof temporary workers, an ATandamp;T spokeswoman said.   The company also proposed several changes to its benefitspackage, spokeswoman Edith Herman said as negotiators for thecompany and two unions continued talks aimed at reaching a newcontract before current pacts for about 160,000 workers expireSaturday.   Ms. Herman could not provide specifics of the new companyproposals but said American Telephone andamp; Telegraph was offering toregulate the use of temporary help, improvements to its eye anddental care programs, a more liberal leave policy to care fornewborn babies and a new leave program to care for sick relatives.   Ms. Zucker said those proposals were being reviewed and that theunions likely would make counter offers later today.   On Thursday, the unions renewed their attack on ATandamp;T's healthcare proposal, which would shift some costs to employers but leavein place existing caps on the maximum they would have to pay in agiven year.   ``ATandamp;T spends megabucks urging Americans to reach out and callour relatives to make sure they're OK, but the only reaching thecompany is doing is into its employees' pockets,'' InternationalBrotherhood of Electrical Workers President Jack Barry said as theunions accused ATandamp;T of withholding data on its medical care costs.   But an ATandamp;T spokesman said the company had produced most of theinformation requested by the unions and was in the process ofcompiling the rest.   Despite the public optimism, both sides are making extensivepreparations for a strike. Union leaders have hinted they will notcall a walkout immediately but likely would do so if an agreementis not reached within a week or so after the contracts expire.   ``A strike remains a weapon but it is a weapon of last resort,''Ms. Zucker said.   ATandamp;T, from its New Jersey operations center, is preparingmanagement ``emergency teams'' to fill in for striking workers ifthere is a walkout, and the company has plans in place to completeall major business installations scheduled for the next five weeks,spokesman Herb Linnen said.   Linnen said the breakdown of the workers represented by theunions was:   _21,500 long-distance operators.   _35,500 field and in-house technicians.   _About 37,000 production workers in factories that makelong-distance switching and transmission equipment, the area ofATandamp;T operations likely to be hit hardest in the event of a strike.``It's pretty difficult to run an assembly line if the picket linesare being honored on a high percentage basis,'' said Linnen, whosaid the plants would be kept open nonetheless.   _About 54,000 other union workers in jobs ranging from clerical,administrative and sales staff to sales representatives in ATandamp;Tretail sales outlets.   ATandamp;T's manufacturing of residential phones is done in Singaporeand would not be affected by a strike. Inventory for the equipmentmanufactured in the United States is ``sparse,'' Linnen said.   Linnen sad management personnel would fill in for strikers.However, he would not provide a breakdown of how they would beassigned.   In the event of a strike, customers who directly diallong-distance calls should experience no significant serviceproblems, but those needing operator assistance could face delaysat peak hours, union and company officials said.   ATandamp;T, which holds about 70 percent of the long-distance market,handles about 80 million calls on a normal business day.   Ms. Zucker said during a 26-day CWA strike in 1986 ``some of themanagers who replaced operators proved they could do the job,others did not. They are forced to work double shifts in unfamiliarjobs, and the added stress would have an impact on the quality ofservice.''</TEXT></DOC>
