Five distinct distributionsfor containment failure have been considered, and the release of nuclidesfrom the UO/sub 2/ matrix, gap (including grain boundary), crud/surfacelayer, and cladding has been calculated with the AREST code. Separatescenarios involving incongruent and congruent release from the UO/sub2/ matrix have also been examined. Based on current data, congruent releasefrom the UO/sub 2/ matrix is considered the anticipated condition forall three repository sites. Releases for individual radionuclides havebeen evaluated relative to compliance with allowable NRC fractional releaserates and EPA 10,000-year cumulative release limits. For the expectedcongruent matrix release scenario, spent fuel is predicted to meet allEPA and NRC release criteria for the distributed containment failuresconsidered in this evaluation. However, for the incongruent matrix releasescenario, releases of several nuclides are found to be above their NRClimits. Additional studies, especially to determine whether release ofnuclides from UO/sub 2/ is congruent or not and define anticipated, site-specificdistributions in containment failure, are needed before these generalto conclusions can be further substantiated.</TEXT></DOC>
