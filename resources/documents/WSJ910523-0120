There has been an extensive debate on the issue,but it has centered on the economic interests involved. Ithas never really clarified the enormous stakes involved forforeign policy and the North American destiny.   Technically, the House and Senate will be voting on theextension of the President's &quot;fast-track&quot; negotiatingauthority. Under this procedure the President can submit atrade pact for something close to an up-or-down congressionalvote; he can promise his partners that he has the power tonegotiate; Congress will be consulted as negotiationsproceed, but individual points will not be subject tolast-minute niggling at the Capitol. This procedure has beenused in typical GATT negotiations and in the landmarkfree-trade agreement with Canada. Today's vote also appliesto the Uruguay round of GATT, but anyone who's awake knowsthe big issue is Mexico. That is why some 75 Members of theHouse remain undeclared, and the issue remains in doubt.</LP><TEXT>   So perhaps it's appropriate to state a few facts of simplegeography: (1) We share a 2,000-mile border with Mexico. (2)Mexico is a nation of some 90 million people. (3) Mexico hasvast resources, particularly of oil and gas. (4) Therelationship between the U.S. and Mexico is a permanent one,for better or for worse.   In that relationship, we are at a moment of unparalleledopportunity. Mexico has abandoned its traditional economicpolicy of prickly autarky, and also its traditionalanti-gringo political rhetoric. President Carlos Salinasstands solidly for a free-enterprise opening, and also forfriendship and cooperation with the U.S. It is all the moreimpressive in terms of the old seesaw dynamics of Mexicanpolitics, that in doing this he builds on a foundation laidby his predecessor, Miguel de la Madrid. Polls in Mexico showthe prospect of free trade is overwhelmingly popular.   The Congress votes now on whether to reward this newattitude, or whether to slap our neighbor in the face. If thelatter, Congress would increase the chances of a reversion inMexican politics. The &quot;dinosaurs,&quot; as they are called inMexico, are quite happy with a system in which aproportionally small, protected elite benefits from privilegedenied the majority. These include members of thebureaucracy, the protected business sector, thegovernment-affiliated unions and, of course, traditionalistswithin the PRI. The membership and politics of this groupinggo a long way toward explaining the nature of the U.S.coalitions opposing the agreement. Or why a Senator such asChris Dodd was reportedly preparing yesterday to voteagainst.   Failure to pass would also lose the real opportunity ofjoint economic development. States in the American Southwest,such as Arizona, have already recognized the potentialbenefits of doing business with a large and seriousdeveloping nation. It would be acutely unsettling for theU.S.'s own prospects to discover that Congress cannotrecognize the fundamental legitimacy of this globalizingprocess.   The organized opposition to the agreement in the U.S. isitself revealing on this point. From the outset it hasconsisted of unions, &quot;consumer&quot; groups and environmentalists.Anything that can attract the simultaneous opposition of theAFL-CIO, Ralph Nader's Public Citizen and Greenpeace isalmost by definition an engine of progress. As in other areasof public policy, the word &quot;reactionary&quot; is being reclaimedby the American left, which is fully prepared to consignMexicans to poverty rather than concede the wealth-creatingpotential of private markets for their goods and services.The coalition's position has been revealed as so economicallyand morally unattractive that it isn't surprising that itcould find support only in certain corners of Washington.   A public issue does not often present itself with suchclarity: It would be a calamity if the fast-track to thesetrade negotiations were rejected, but it would be an enormousopportunity if it is approved. There are a great manyintelligent, hard-working people in the United States, Mexicoand Canada who are prepared to take risks and makeinvestments so that the peoples of their nations have themeans to share with each other the benefits of economicprogress through the next century. Rather than retardprogress, the Members of Congress should show by their votestoday that they too wish to contribute to the vitality of theAmerican future.</TEXT></DOC>
