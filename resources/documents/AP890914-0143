One official said his department would license others to use anenginereed chicken even though it wasn't patented.   A bill sponsored by Rep. Robert Kastenmeier, D-Wis., is intendedto respond to concerns among farmers that corporate control ofpatents will lead to corporate control of agriculture, creating amodern version of sharecropping.   A similar bill by Kastenmeier passed the House last year, but theSenate took no action.   Representatives of the Agriculture, Commerce and Health and HumanServices departments told Kastenmeier's House Judiciary subcommitteeon courts, intellectual property and the administration of justicethat patents on so-called transgenic animals are the only way toguarantee that anyone will invest in research on the technique.   The genetically engineered animals are necessary for biomedicalresearch, development of resistant crops and farm animals, andultimately for international competition, the three said.   The exemption in Kastenmeier's bill would allow farmers toreproduce a patented animal through breeding or sell a patentedanimal or its offspring without paying a fee, or royalty, to thepatent holder _ in effect, an automatic license for farmers.   The sale of germ cells, semen or embryos from a patented animalwould remain prohibited as patent infringements.   Daniel Jones, deputy director for biotechnology at theAgriculture Department, said the department has applied for a``statutory invention registration'' with the Patent Office for astrain of transgenic chickens it developed resistant to the poultrydisease avian leukosis.   Such registration preempts others from obtaining patents but doesallow others to use the invention.   ``This arrangement may provide a useful opportunity to gatherdata on the potential economic demand, distribution, and performanceof a transgenic animal before livestock and poultry producers arefaced with an onslaught of new strains and varieties whose economicimpacts cannot now be predicted,'' he said.   Donald J. Quigg, assistant Commerce secretary and commissioner ofpatents and trademarks, told the subcommittee, ``Neither theimposition of compulsory licensing nor a moratorium on the patentingof inventions pertaining to the field of transgenic animals is inthe national interest.''   Compulsory licensing is an idea advanced by a number of ThirdWorld countries who say they can use an invention _ a drug forinstance _ for which a patent exists but the holder does not wish toproduce.   Those licenses, however, would involve some royalty payment.   The world's first animal patent was issued in April 1988 toresearchers at Harvard Medical School for a mouse geneticallyengineered for use in cancer research.</TEXT></DOC>
