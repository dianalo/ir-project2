Section 4(a) of the Act makes it ``unlawfulfor any person to offer to enter into, to enter into, to execute, to confirmthe execution of * * * or otherwise deal[] in any transaction in, or inconnection with, a contract for the purchase or sale of a commodity forfuture delivery'' that is not made ``on or subject to the rules of a boardof trade which has been designated by the Commission as a `contract market'for such commodity.'' 7 U.S.C. 6(a).\2\<NOTE/> Section 4c of the Act generally permits the trading of commodityoptions only pursuant to regulations issued by the Commission and grantsthe Commission the authority to permit the offer and sale of commodityoptions without the requirement of exchange trading ``under such termsand conditions as the Commission may prescribe.'' 7 U.S.C. 6c(b), 6c(c).\3\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The Act provides that the term ``future delivery'' doesnot include any sale of any cash commodity for deferred shipment or delivery.7 U.S.C. 2. This interpretation does not address the scope or content ofthat exclusion.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ This prohibition does not apply to contracts ``made onor subject to the rules of a board of trade, exchange, or market locatedoutside the United States * * *.'' 7 U.S.C. 6(a).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Section 4c(f) of the Act provides, however, that the Actshall not be deemed to govern or apply ``to any transaction in an optionon foreign currency traded <T3>on</T3> a national securities exchange.'' 7 U.S.C. 6c(f). (Emphasisadded).The development of hybrid instruments that couple elements of futures contractsor commodity options with debt or depository obligations is a recent phenomenon.This development reflects commercial interest in offering instruments thatare indexed to or have a return that is otherwise calculated by referenceto the price of a commodity through transactions that take place otherthan on designated futures or option exchanges. The development of thesehybrid instruments with commodity-related components has given rise touncertainty concerning the treatment of such instruments by the Commissionunder the CEA and Commission regulations.\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ The Task Force on Off-Exchange Instruments, in lettersdated September 30 and November 2, 1988, determined that it would not recommendthe initiation of enforcement action under section 4c of the Act, 7 U.S.C.6c (1982), based upon the issuance of notes by two different companies.<T3>See also, e.g.</T3>, CFTC Advisory No. 39-88, June 23, 1988 (InterpretativeLetter No. 88-10); CFTC Advisory No. 45-88, July 19, 1988 (InterpretativeLetter No. 88-11); CFTC Advisory No. 48-88, July 26, 1988 (InterpretativeLetter No. 88-12); CFTC Advisory No. 63-88, September 21, 1988 (InterpretativeLetter No. 88-14); and CFTC Advisory No. 66-88, September 28, 1988 (InterpretativeLetter No. 88-15). In determining whether a transaction constitutes a futures or options contract,the Commission assesses the transaction as a whole with a critical eyetoward its underlying purpose.\5\<NOTE/> Through this interpretation, the Commission is stating itsview that certain categories of hybrid instruments are not within the coverageof the Act and Commission regulations. The Commission's interpretationsaddresses those hybrid instruments that are debt securities within themeaning of section 2(1) of the Securities Act of 1933, or time depositswithin the meaning of 12 CFR 204.2(c)(1) offered by a bank that is a FederalDeposit Insurance Corporation (``FDIC'') member and marketed and sold directlyto a customer.\6\<NOTE/> Treatment under this interpretation is limited to such hybridinstruments that are bona fide debt or depository instruments and that:(1) Are indexed to a commodity on no greater than a one-to-one basis; (2)limit the maximum loss on the instrument; (3) have a significant commodity-independentyield \7\<NOTE/>; (4) do not have a commodity component that is severablefrom the debt or depository instrument; (5) do not call for delivery ofa commodity by means of an instrument specified in the rules of a designatedcontract market; and (6) are not marketed as being or having the characteristicsof a futures contract or commodity option.\8\<NOTE/> These additional criteria are discussed below.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ <T3>See, e.g., CFTC v. Co Petro Marketing Group, Inc.,</T3> 680 F.2d 573,581 (9th Cir. 1982) (transactions held to be futures contracts).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ Under this interpretation, instruments having returnsindexed to or calculated on the basis of the price of a commodity thatare not bona fide debt or depository instruments will not be viewed ashybrid instruments even though they incorporate some features common tosecurities or depository instruments.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ The term commodity-independent yield means the yield tomaturity on the hybrid instrument due solely to commodity-independent payments.As used herein, the term commodity-independent payment means any paymentpursuant to a hybrid instrument that does not result from indexing to orcalculation by reference to the price of a commodity. In addition, as usedherein, the term commodity-dependent payment means any payment pursuantto a hybrid instrument resulting from indexing to or calculation by referenceto the price of a commodity.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ The approach contained in this interpretation is consistentwith Commission and court precedent analyzing the characteristics of futurescontracts and commodity options in other contexts. <T3>See, e.g., Co Petro Marketing Group; Precious Metals Associates, Inc.v. CFTC</T3>, 620 F.2d 900 (1st Cir. 1980); <T3>CFTC v. Wellington Precious Metals, Inc.</T3>, No. 85-3565-Civ-ATKINS(S.D. Fla. July 12, 1988); <T3>CFTC v. American Metal Exchange Corp.</T3>, 693 F. Supp. 168 (D.N.J.1988) (appeal pending); <T3>CFTC v. Trinity Metals Exchange,</T3> No. 85-1482-CV-W-3 (W.D. Mo.Jan 21, 1986); <T3>CFTC v. U.S. Metals Depository Co.</T3>, 468 F. Supp. 1149 (S.D.N.Y.1979); <T3>CFTC v. Morgan, Harris andamp; Scott, Ltd.</T3>, 484 F. Supp. 669 (S.D.N.Y.1979); <T3>In re First National Monetary Corp.</T3>, [1984-86 Transfer Binder]Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) andpara; 22,698 (CFTC 1985); <T3>In re Stovall</T3>, [1977-1980 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep.(CCH) andpara; 20,941 (CFTC 1979).First, the instrument's commodity-dependent payments must be no greaterthan on a one-to-one basis. This means that for hybrid instruments offeringa coupon or interest rate indexed to or calculated by reference to theprice of a commodity, the percentage change in such coupon or interestrate for any payment period may not exceed the percentage change in thecommodity price to which the coupon or interest payment is indexed. Forhybrid instruments having a face value so indexed or calculated, the percentagechange in the commodity-dependent payment may not exceed the percentagechange in the commodity price to which the face value is indexed, provided,however, that the commodity-dependent payment must be adjusted for anyrepayments of the face value prior to maturity. In the case of hybrid instrumentshaving a face value <T3>and</T3> a coupon or interest so indexed or calculated, the percentagechange in each of the commodity-dependent payments must meet the applicablerequirements stated above. Under this test, for example, the change inthe value of a commodity-dependent payment which is indexed to the faceamount of an instrument may not exceed the change in the value of an amountof the commodity whose value at the time of issuance equals the face amountof the instrument.\9\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ <T3>See</T3> CFTC Advisory No. 39-88, June 23, 1988 (Interpretative LetterNo. 88-10, at p. 4), in which the Commission's Off-Exchange Task Forcegranted no-action relief with respect to proposed offering of foreign currency-linkeddebt instruments, where, among other things, the instrument's face valueindexed to the yen on no more than a one-to-one basis. The no-action letterstated that these notes provided both an interest payment denominated indollars and repayment of principal based on yen value ``such that the Notesprovide a fixed interest payment together with a principal return resembling,in many respects, a yen-denominated bond which, when converted into dollars,reflects the prevailing exchange rate.''  Second, the maximum loss of the purchaser on the commodity-dependent componentmust be limited as described below. In the case of a hybrid instrumentoffering a coupon or interest indexed to or calculated by referenece tothe price of a commodity, the maximum loss of each coupon or interest paymentmay not exceed the commodity-indepenent interest. In the case of a hybridinstrument with a face value so indexed or calculated, the maximum lossof the purchaser may not exceed the face value or purchase price of theinstrument, whichever is greater. In the case of a hybrid instrument havingboth a coupon or interest and face value so indexed or calculated, themaximum loss may not exceed the respective limits stated above. In anyevent, the issuer must receive full payment for the instrument upon itsissuance, and the provisions of the instrument cannot require a purchaseror any holder to pay additional ``out-of-pocket'' funds or considerationduring the life of the instrument or at its maturity.  Third, in order to limit the commodity-dependent yield, the commodity-independentyield must equal at least 50%, but no more than 150%, of the estimatedannual yield at the time of issuance for a comparable non-hybird debt ordepository instrument issued by the same or a similar issuer.\1\\0\<NOTE/> As a result of this requirement, for example, no more thanhalf of the issue price of a hybrid coupon par bond of long maturity wouldbe attributable to the value of its commodity-dependent component.\1\\1\<NOTE/> In addition, the commodity-independent yield paid over thelife of the instrumenmt would be at least one half of what would be paidon a conventional debt or depository instrument.\1\\2\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\ Examples of the operation of the commodity-independentyield criterion and other elements of this statement are contained in theattachment to this interpretation.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\1\ Application of this standard under the assumption ofan interest rate of 10% means that coupon instruments issued at par withup to a one year maturity could have commodity components which accountfor approximately 5% of the issue price; such instruments with a maturityof five years could have commodity components which account for approximately20% of the issue price; and such instruments with a maturity of ten yearscould have commodity components which account for approximately 30% ofthe issue price.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\2\ For hybrid instruments designed to afford a real rateof return through indexing to the Consumer Price Index or other broadlybased inflation measures, the estimated annual yield of a comparable non-hybridinstrument would be the estimated real rate of interest, calculated asthe bond-equivalent yeild of the most recently issued one-year Treasurybill less the most recently announced annualized percentage change in theConsumer Price Index.This interpretation is not applicable to any instrument that would permitthe commodity-dependent component to be traded separately.\1\\3\<NOTE/> For example, instruments in which the commodity-dependentcomponent has a longer maturity than the commodity-independent componentwould not be covered by this interpretation.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\3\ However, options on securities are excluded from Commissionregulation. 7 U.S.C. 2a(i).In addition, this interpretation does not apply to hybrid instruments whichsettle by means of a delivery instrument, such as an exchange-approvedwarehouse receipt or shipping certificate, that is specified in the rulesof a designated contract market. This limitation would not interfere withthe ability of issuers to develop hybrid instruments with physical deliveryalternatives to cash settlement, but provides some protection against interferencewith deliverable supplies for settlement of designated futures or optioncontracts.\1\\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\4\ Such protection against interference with deliverablesupplies is vital to the prevention of price manipulation on designatedcontract markets, which is central to the Commission's regulatory mission.<T3>See </T3>7 U.S.C. 5, 7, 7a, 9, and 13(b).This interpretation also would not apply to hybrid instruments that aremarketed as being or having the characteristics of a futures contract ora commodity option, except to the extent necessary to describe the operationof the instrument or to comply with applicable disclosure requirements.The Commission believes that this marketing limitation balances the needto prevent misleading characterizations of the nature of these instrumentsagainst the objective of assuring meaningful disclosure of their actualoperation and risks.Through this interpretation, the Commission is extending the type of analysisunderlying the <T3>de minimis </T3>category suggested in its Advance Notice of ProposedRulemaking (Regulation of Hybrid and Related Instruments) (``Advance Notice''),52 FR 47022 (Dec. 11, 1987) to a broader class of commodity-related instruments.\1\\5\<NOTE/> As such, this interpretation continues the Commission's ongoingefforts to coordinate and harmonize its regulatory framework with thoseof other federal regulators in a manner consistent with Congressional intentand the public interest.\1\\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\ As discussed in the Advance Notice, the Commissionis of the view that, in general, non-transferable annuities or pensionsderived from an employment relationship that are indexed to a commodityor group of commodities, as well as adjustable rate mortgages, employmentagreements, leases and similar agreements, are beyond the purview of theCEA and Commission regulations. Further, the Commission is of the viewthat, in general, lending or deposit instruments in which the interestpayments are measured by reference to published interest rates or indicesof interest rates such as the prime rate, the London Interbank Offer Rate(LIBOR), and Treasury bill rates are beyond the purview of the Act andCommission regulations. Moreover, while this statutory interpretation doesnot expressly discuss loans offered by FDIC member banks, the Commissionbelieves that commerical loans, that is, bank loans directly to a commercialcustomer for the purpose of providing funds for use by the customer inits business (<T3>See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System v. Dimension FinancialCorp.</T3>, 474 U.S. 361 (1985)) as well as loans to foreign governmentsor political subdivisions thereof, would be beyond the purview of the CEAand Commission regulations.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>Commission Regulation 1.17, 17 CFR 1.17 (1988) (Minimumfinancial requirements for broker/dealer futures commission merchants);Commission Regulation andSection; 4.5, 17 CFR 4.5 (1988) (Exclusion fromthe definition of commodity pool operator for certain otherwise-regulatedpersons); Interim Report of the Working Group on Financial Markets (May1988).This interpretation is intended to clarify that hybrid instruments whichprovide a commodity-linked return and meet the criteria described aboveare, when viewed as a whole, more appropriately treated as debt securitiesor bank depository instruments rather than as commodity futures or commodityoption contracts. Issuers of hybrid debt securities instruments would besubject to the Securities Act of 1933 and, as such, would be required eitherto comply with applicable registration requirements or to qualify for anexemption therefrom. Hybrid bank offerings would be subject to the requirementsimposed on the FDIC-Insured offering bank by its Federal regulators.\1\\7\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\ The Commission has received correspondence from thestaffs of the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC''), the Board ofGovernor of the Federal Reserve System, and the Office of the Comptrollerof the Currency reviewing their respective regulatory frameworks as applicablein these areas and recognizing their oversight responsibilities with respectto hybrid instruments. <T3>See </T3>Letter from Richard G.

Such views may be submitted tothe Commission at the address set forth above. Prior to the effective dateof this interpretation, the Commission will not take any enforcement actionregarding offerings which meet the criteria set forth above. The Commissionalso will continue to consider relief on a case-by-case basis for instrumentsnot addressed in this interpretation.\1\\8\<NOTE/> This interpretation supersedes the procedures establishedby Commission Advisories 48-88 (July 26, 1988) and 56-88 (August 19, 1988).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\ The Commission will address swap transactions and otherinterests in later releases.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC, on January 5, 1989, by the Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jean A.

Introduction </ITAG>Provided below are analyses of two hybrid instruments under the followingcriteria discussed in the interpretative statement: One-to-One Indexing,Maximum Loss, Commodity-Independent Yield, and Non-Severability. As discussedin that statement, any instrument which satisfies these criteria also mustsatisfy the interpretation's other criteria to be treated as excluded fromthe CFTC's jurisdiction. Section II of this attachment illustrates an instrumentwith its face value indexed to a foreign exchange rate while Section IIIillustrates an instrument with its interest payment indexed to the priceof gold.<ITAG tagnum="85">II. Bond Whose Face Value is Indexed to a Foreign Exchange Rate </ITAG>The instrument to be examined in this example has the following characteristics:(1) The face value is $1000 and the instrument is issued at par; (2) thecoupon is 12% per annum of the $1000 face value;\1\<NOTE/> (3) assuming a spot exchange rate at issuance of one Britishpound equal to two U.S. dollars, <T3>i.e., </T3>L1=$2, the face value of the bond is adjusted by the changein the dollar value of 500 British pounds, <T3>i.e., </T3>$1000/$2 per L=500L, from the price of pounds at the timeof issuance to maturity; (4) any downward adjustment to the face valuecannot exceed the amount of the face value ($1000); (5) the instrument'scommodity component is not severable. Based upon the above, the <T3>commodity-independent payment</T3> consists of a fixed coupon paymentper annum of $120 and, at maturity, the face value of $1000. The <T3>commodity-dependent payment</T3>, which constitutes the embedded futures-likecomponent, may be represented as follows: <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ It is assumed that a conventional bond by the same orsimilar issuer would have a 10% coupon.Commodity-dependent payment=L500andmultiply;($/L<T2>mat</T2>^$2/L)\2\<NOTE/> Thus, the coupon, face value, and commodity-dependent paymentsat maturity may be represented, respectively, as follows: $120+$1000+L500andmultiply;($/L<T2>mat</T2>^L $2/L).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ If, instead, the exchange rate at issuance were assumedto be L1=$3, then the commodity-dependent payment would be: $1000/$3 perL=L333.33andmultiply;($/L<T2>mat</T2>^$3/L).One-to-One Indexing The description of the instrument's commodity adjustment satisfies theone-to-one indexing criterion: A 1% change in the dollar-pound exchangerate changes the commodity-dependent payment by an amount equal to 1% ofthe $1000 face value. Assume that at maturity there is a 1% rise in thevalue of the pound vis-a-vis the dollar, <T3>i.e., </T3>1L=$2.02. As a result, the commodity-dependent payment atmaturity equals the following:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,aw,30,3,5</C> <H1>L500andmultiply;($2.02/L^$2/L)=L500andmultiply;</H1><H1>$.02</H1><H2>L</H2><H1>=$10</H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">This $10 adjustment to face value, therefore, corresponds to a 1%change as a percentage of face value <T3>i.e., </T3>$1000andmultiply;.01=$10.Maximum Loss The description of the instrument also prohibits a loss greater than theface value. Essentially, a complete loss of the face value requires a changein the exchange rate such that the pound declines to zero dollars. In thiscase, the commodity-dependent payment would be equal to ^$1000. Therefore,the repayment at maturity is zero dollars because the $1000 return of facevalue is offset by the ^$1000 commodity-dependent payment. Note that theinstrument as constructed provides for a coupon payment of $120, nonetheless.Commodity-Independent Yield The coupon payment associated with the instrument is 12% of the face value.Since it has been assumed that the same or a similar issuer of a comparablenon-hybrid bond would issue such an instrument with a 10% yield, the hybridinstrument's coupon is 120% of that estimated yield. Hence, the criterionthat the commodity-independent yield be within the range of 50% to 150%of the estimated yield at the time of issuance is satisfied.Non-Severable Commodity ComponentBy its terms, the instrument examined cannot be severed into a separatecommodity component and non-commodity component. It is important to recognizethat, even though the analysis conceptually decomposes the instrument intocomponent parts, the component parts cannot be decomposed subsequent toor at issuance.<ITAG tagnum="85">III. Depository Instrument Whose Interest Payment is Indexed to thePrice of Gold</ITAG>The instrument to be examined in this example is as follows: (1) The depositedamount or face value is $1000, and the instrument is issued at par; (2)the interest yield is 8% per annum of the deposited amount or face value;\3\<NOTE/> (3) the commodity-dependent interest payment is obtainedby dividing the commodity-independent interest payment by $500. This quantityis then multiplied by the difference between the spot price of gold atthe time of the interest payment and $500, if the spot price of gold exceeds$500; otherwise, there is no adjustment; (4) the commodity-dependent paymentcannot result in a loss that is more than the commodity-independent interestpayment; (5) the commodity component and non-commodity component are notseverable.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ The time to maturity is assumed to be one year with theinterest paid at year end. In addition, the same or a similarly situatedissuer of a one-year $1000 deposit is assumed to pay 10% per annum.Based upon the above, the commodity-independent payment consists of a fixedinterest payment of $80 and the face value of $1000 at maturity (<T3>i.e., </T3>year end). For such a depository instrument, the commodity-dependentpayment, which constitutes the embedded option-like component, may be representedat $80 multiplied by the difference between the spot price of gold at thetime of the interest payment and $500 divided by $500, if the spot priceof gold exceeds $500. If the spot price of gold is less than or equal to$500, the commodity-dependent payment is equal to zero. Thus, the adjustedinterest payment is: $80+commodity-dependent payment, and the total paymentat maturity is: $1000+$80+commodity-dependent payment.One-to-OneThe instrument described above satisfies the one-to-one criterion becausethe indexing feature adjusts the commodity-dependent interest payment asa percentage of the commodity-independent interest payment by the samerate of change as that of the price of gold. That is, a 1% rise in thespot price of gold results in an $.80 commodity-dependent interest payment,which is 1% of the commodity-independent interest payment of $80. To illustrate,assume that the price of gold at issuance is $500. Suppose that by theinterest payment date the spot price of gold increases by 1% to $505. Asa result, the commodity-dependent interest payment is as follows: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>1,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,aw,30</C><H1>$80andmultiply;($505-$500)/$500=$.80</H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">This $.80 commodity-dependent payment corresponds to 1% of the commodity-independentinterest payment, <T3>i.e.</T3>, $80andmultiply;.01=$.80.Maximum LossThe description of the instrument prohibits a reduction in the interestpayment. The adjustment formula only allows increases in payments basedon changes in the price of gold since the commodity component is option-like.Accordingly, the description of the instrument states that an adjustmentcannot reduce the fixed interest payment.Commodity-Independent YieldThe instrument provides an 8% per annum interest payment. This fixed interestpayment equals 80% of the assumed normal interest payment of 10%. As aresult, the commodity-independent yield of the depository instrument iswithin the range of the 50% to 150% commodity-independent yield criterion.Non-Severable Commodity ComponentThe instrument as defined, although examined conceptually by its constituentparts, cannot be severed subsequent to or at issuance.<ITAG tagnum="40">[FR DOC. 89-476 Filed 1-10-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6351-01-M </ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
