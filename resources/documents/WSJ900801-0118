A White House official said President Bush and topcongressional Democrats yesterday tentatively agreed to setfirm dates in September for floor votes on an agreement, eventhough they haven't reached one. But some Democratic budgetnegotiators are resisting what Sen. Wyche Fowler (D., Ga.)termed making any &quot;agreement to agree&quot; on spending cuts andtax increases.</LP><TEXT>   House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta (D., Calif.)said budget negotiators are talking about an ambitiousschedule of resuming talks immediately after Labor Day with agoal of reaching an accord by Sept. 10, the day the rest ofthe Congress returns from its summer recess. The goal wouldbe to get Congress to enact the agreement by Oct. 1.   Mr. Bush and congressional Republicans want the entireCongress to ratify that timetable, but a parliamentarymechanism for that hasn't been agreed to yet.   Preoccupied with tactics, schedules and the pending Augustrecess, budget negotiators have spent little time in the pastweek talking about the substance of what spending to cut orwhat taxes to increase. Nevertheless, the White House so farhas displayed no sign that Mr. Bush has accepted advice fromsome congressional Republicans that he criticize Democratsfor not putting forward a deficit-reduction proposal of theirown.   But a White House official said that Mr. Bush and topDemocrats have agreed to &quot;break the code of silence&quot; that wassupposed to surround the talks. The new posture would allowboth sides to &quot;debate publicly the merits of ideas,&quot; and thatcould open the door to more partisan debate in the next fewweeks.   Mr. Bush invited congressional Republicans to breakfastthis morning, and some of them expect the president to begincriticizing the Democrats soon after that.   Republican budget negotiators continue to insist that Rep.Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.), the House majority leader,indicated to budget negotiators on July 24 that Democratswould present a deficit-reduction plan of their own within afew days. Democrats deny that he made any such promise. &quot;Idon't think there was any reneging,&quot; Rep. Gephardt said.&quot;There may have been some miscommunications about what was tohappen.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
