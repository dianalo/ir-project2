In order to achieve this general goal, three specifictasks are addressed. First, a number of important factors are identifiedin the literature on presidential policy making. Second, the variousroles Congress can play in energy policy making are analyzed, and, finally,key floor votes on energy issues in both the House and Senate from 1977to 1982 are analyzed and explained in terms of party affiliation andideology. Although the primary focus is on the roles played by Congress,the latter is predominantly a reactive institution, and some observationsneed to be made about salient factors in presidential-congressional behavior.</TEXT></DOC>
