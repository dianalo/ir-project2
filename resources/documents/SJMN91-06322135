Baker has one final meeting scheduled with ChineseForeign Minister Qian Qichen this morning.;   Hungry for results;   Theofficial stressed that the Bush administration, which has been criticizedintensely in Congress as too conciliatory toward China, would like to havesome concrete results by the end of Baker's visit.;   The State Departmentofficial suggested that if Baker comes up empty on this trip, relationsbetween the United States and China -- which have been chilly ever sinceBeijing's bloody repression of the 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations inTiananmen Square -- may become still worse.;   The Chinese government wasequally tough in its account of the talks. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesmanWu Jianmin stressed the theme of Chinese nationalism and said the Chineseleadership does not intend to be intimidated.;   Veiled resentment;   At anews briefing, Wu said Premier Li Peng told Baker: &quot;The Chinese nation, with ahistory of more than 5,000 years, has a strong sense of national dignity. Formore than 100 years in recent history, we the Chinese people suffered verymuch foreign aggression and humiliation. So we especially cherish ourindependence and sovereignty.&quot;;   Baker talked to Li for more than two hoursSaturday, and he also met for more than an hour with Chinese President YangShangkun, a military strongman and the most powerful figure among China'sactive leaders. Yang and Li were among the key leaders behind the 1989crackdown.;   He also saw Communist Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin,Justice Minister Cai Cheng and Trade Minister Li Lanqing.;   It was not clearwhether the two sides were hopelessly far apart in their talks, or whethereach side was staking out a tough position as a negotiating tactic.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Los Angeles Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Beijing  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911117  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  15A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  458  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday, November 17, 199100322135,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
