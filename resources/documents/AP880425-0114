(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An explosion and fire struck the submarineUSS Bonefish off Florida, forcing the crew to abandon ship, theNavy said. Three of the 92-member crew were missing today and 23were injured.   Crews from two frigates and a helicopter searched the Atlanticfor the missing men after Sunday afternoon's fire, ``looking andlistening for any kind of sound or indication'' of the men, saidLt. Cmdr. Bill Sonntag of the Norfolk-based Atlantic Fleet.   ``We're doing everything we can to find them out there,'' hesaid.   The submarine was afloat alongside the frigate USS McCloy,officials said.   ``No one has been back on board to assess the damage,'' ChiefPetty Officer Terry Borton said today from Atlantic Fleetheadquarters here. ``At this time, there is no smoke coming fromthe vessel.''   The Bonefish, one of the Navy's last diesel-electric submarines,surfaced Sunday afternoon 160 miles east of Cape Canaveral, Fla.,said Cmdr. Fred Leeder, a fleet spokesman.   The fire was believed caused by an explosion in the 30-year-oldsubmarine's battery compartment, Sonntag said. Because of fire andtoxic fumes, the commanding officer ordered the vessel evacuated,he said.   Of the missing, ``We don't know whether they are still aboardthe submarine or whether they were in the water,'' said Capt. BrentBaker, another fleet spokesman.   The injured were transfered to the aircraft carrier John F.Kennedy and taken to the Naval Hospital in Jacksonville, Fla.,according Borton.   The extent of the injuries were unknown, but ``some of them hadsmoke inhalation,'' Baker said.   A spokesman for the hospital, Nick Young, said that of the 23injured, 20 were ambulatory, but he had no further information.   The remainder of the Bonefish's crewmen were taken aboard thefrigate USS Carr and taken to Mayport, Fla., for a flight back tothe Bonefish's home port of Charleston, S.C.   The solemn-faced crewmen refused requests from reporters toanswer questions about the fire when they arrived in Mayport. Mostwere wearing blue coveralls and sneakers, but many were shoeless. Afew carried small plastic bags, apparently holding a few of theirbelongings.   They were taken to a waiting cargo plane.   Chaplain Bill Perry went aboard the Carr and visited the men.   He said the general mood was ``overwhelming fatigue,'' addingthat most had been up all night and many had been on watch thenight before.   ``They've been through a real trauma,'' he said.   Leeder said the Carr would attempt to tow the submarine eitherto Port Canaveral, Fla., or Charleston. There apparently was noserious problem in keeping it afloat late Sunday, Leeder said.   The submarine rescue ship USS Petrel from Charleston is on itsway and will determine whether the fire is out, the Navy said. ThePetrel is expected to arrive early this afternoon.   ``People from the Petrel will be boarding the sub to make anykind of damage assessment,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Patricia McMillan, alsoa Norfolk spokesman, adding that afterward, a decision would bemade on where to tow the sub.   Leeder said it would take considerable time to tow the Bonefishinto port. It can make about 3 mph under tow, a senior navalofficer said.   The Bonefish had been taking part in routine exercises for abouta week with the Carr and the JFK in what is called the JacksonvilleOperations area, authorities said.   The sub was commissioned in 1959 and is used primarily fortraining, Leeder said.   The 2,895-ton, 219-foot submarine was built by New YorkShipbuilding in Camden, N.J., and launched in 1958. It normallycarries a crew of 82. It is capable of traveling about 15 knots onthe surface and about 21 knots submerged, according to Jane'sFighting Ships.   It is powered by three 1,500-horsepower diesel engines thatdrive a single propeller while traveling on the surface. Oncesubmerged, it is driven by two electric motors.   The Bonefish, like its sister vessels the Barbel and Blueback,is capable of carrying torpedoes, but no missiles.   They were the last diesel-electric combat submarines to beconstructed for the Navy and were expected to be decomissioned inthe '80s.   Navy officials use the diesel-powered subs to simulate Sovietsubmarines because the Soviet Union still operates approximately100 diesel-electric vessels. In all, the United States operatesfour diesel-electric boats.</TEXT></DOC>
