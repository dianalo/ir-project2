One commentator, Stepan Kiselyov, deputy editor of MoscowNews, is even talking about &quot;a coup from within&quot; therepublic.</LP><TEXT>   Over the past two weeks, Russian Prime Minister IvanSilayev and a prominent economic expert, Mikhail Bocharov,have quit their posts in anger after attacks on theirpersonal loyalty and the dismissive rejection of their policyproposals. Several of the most senior remaining officials, inscenes more reminiscent of amateur theater than seriouspolitics, have been trading insults in public and calling foreach other's resignation.   Even Mr. Yeltsin isn't immune to attack. Some officialsare criticizing the Russian president for taking an extendedvacation at a time when key issues about the future of theU.S.S.R. are being decided. And he is under fire forsurrounding himself with cronies from his home town ofSverdlovsk even though many of them have dubious democraticcredentials.   Far more than political ambition and personal jealousy liebehind this disarray. At issue are two fundamental andunresolved questions: what role Russia should play in afuture U.S.S.R., and how to organize a smooth-runningadministration that is both democratic and effective.   Heated debates over these issues have all but paralyzedthe Russian government, sparking alarm among its mostreformminded officials. Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreignminister, warned last week that time is running out forradical democratic changes. If Russia doesn't seize theopportunity for such change over the next few months, hesaid, &quot;the wave of optimism that appeared in August {afterthe coup} will give way to general mistrust followed bychaos.&quot;   Evoking Weimar Germany, Mr. Kozyrev even raised thespecter of a fascist dictator seizing power. While that mayseem farfetched, nobody doubts that there is now a vacuum ofpower in the White House, the Russian Parliament building inMoscow where the opposition to the August coup held out.   The latest manifestation of this void has been a round ofmudslinging over Russia's future role. It started last weekafter Gennady Burbulis, perhaps Mr. Yeltsin's closest aide,told Parliament, &quot;Russia is the only republic that could andmust become the rightful inheritor of the {former U.S.S.R.}and all its structures.&quot; That statement, which sent a shudderthrough other republics already nervous about a revival ofRussian chauvinism, has split Mr. Yeltsin's entourage.   The statement won some support from Sergei Stankevich, theformer deputy mayor of Moscow who is now a Yeltsin adviser.Mr. Stankevich told Tass news agency that Russia shouldbecome an independent state immediately, to put itself onequal footing with other republics that have declaredindependence. While he believes Russia doesn't need to assumeall the functions of the Soviet central authorities, hesuggested that it should take control of all Soviet nuclearweapons.   But Mr. Burbulis ran into fierce criticism from anotherkey figure in the Yeltsin government, Ruslan Khasbulatov,speaker of the Russian Parliament. At a news conference onThursday that was notable for its candor, Mr. Khasbulatovlaid into Mr. Burbulis and another Yeltsin aide, SergeiShakhrai, calling for their resignations.   &quot;Their stance doesn't fit into the framework of astatesman's conduct,&quot; Mr. Khasbulatov said. &quot;They aren'tmature enough.&quot; Among other things, he criticized the way thetwo aides had formulated some of Mr. Yeltsin's most recentdecrees, which have come under fire for being on shaky legalground. His remarks sparked a furor in the Russian ParliamentFriday, prompting Mr. Khasbulatov to announce that he himselfwas ready to resign &quot;at any time.&quot;   Adding to such backbiting is a struggle over how toorganize a democratic government. The issue, which has doggedPresident Mikhail Gorbachev for the past two years, is nowbeing debated in many republics as they struggle through thetransformation from communist totalitarianism to democracy.   Even before the botched coup, Mr. Yeltsin had toyed formonths with changes in the structure of the Russiangovernment. Worried that old-style bureaucrats with closeties to the Communist Party were sabotaging his reformefforts, Mr. Yeltsin resolved to create new political bodiesand pack them with his supporters.   But the State Council he eventually set up in July as acounterweight to the Council of Ministers, which wields allexecutive power, has failed to establish itself as aneffective body. There has been talk for months that areshuffling is imminent.   But Mr. Yeltsin has dithered -- and given reformistcolleagues a glimpse at another side of his political style.In recent weeks, he has surrounded himself with people whoonce worked with him in the Communist Party apparatus inSverdlovsk, where he served as party leader in the 1970s andearly 1980s.   Among those elevated to top positions are Yuri Petrov, whoreplaced Mr. Yeltsin as the Sverdlovsk party first secretary;Oleg Lobov, the city's former second party secretary; andseveral other Communist officials. Reform-minded officials,including deputies from Sverdlovsk who know the new Yeltsinaides, are alarmed.   &quot;Russia is sliding toward a presidential monarchy,&quot; warnedthe liberal newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda in an articleabout Mr. Yeltsin's new entourage. It quoted one Sverdlovskdeputy, Larisa Mishustina, as saying that Mr. Yeltsin's faithin his former Communist cronies &quot;is dangerous not only forthe democratic course of the president, but also perhaps forhis own life.&quot; She suggested that the new advisers could beas unfaithful to Mr. Yeltsin as Mr. Gorbachev's aides were tohim -- it was the Soviet president's advisers who staged thefailed coup.   With recriminations flying, some officials have alreadydecided to throw in the towel. Mr. Silayev, who had served asRussian prime minister for 18 months, stepped down afterfinding himself in the middle of a heated battle overRussia's relations with Mr. Gorbachev's central government.Following the coup, Mr. Gorbachev appointed Mr. Silayev tohead an interim committee managing the economy. Facingpressure from both sides, it became impossible to hold bothjobs. He almost quit the committee post, but decided to dropthe Russian job instead after becoming the target of bitterpersonal attacks.   Mr. Bocharov, a well-known entrepreneur, followed suitlast week. He was chairman of Russia's Supreme EconomicCouncil, charged with devising reforms. But numerousproposals he made were ignored amid the power struggle. &quot;Isimply wasn't listened to,&quot; Mr. Bocharov said, adding that hewill now devote his time to a building concern he foundedthree years ago.</TEXT></DOC>
