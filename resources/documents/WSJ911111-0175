Creditors balked, though, and after months ofnegotiations, Mr. Plaskett had to settle for $1 million whenhe resigned in September.</LP><TEXT>   Still, Mr. Plaskett should consider himself lucky.Generous severance agreements are under attack, and companiesare starting to change their policies. In the last two years,about 10% of Fortune 500 businesses have replaced lucrative&quot;golden parachute&quot; plans with more modest severance programs,estimates Robert Romanchek, an executive compensationconsultant at Hewitt Associates.   Creditors, government officials and stockholdersincreasingly protest when troubled businesses pay departingexecutives big sums. Last summer, unhappy creditors compelledtroubled Continental Airlines Holdings Inc. to stopguaranteeing that 18 officers would get severance payments ifthey quit on their own rather than being axed. Last January,federal bank regulators forced Alan Hoblitzell, ex-chairmanof loss-ridden MNC Financial Inc., to return $915,865 inseverance pay. And seven executives of Mutual Benefit LifeInsurance Co. had to renounce their claims to $3.2 million inseverance and deferred compensation in August after theseized insurer's promised awards drew harsh criticism fromNew Jersey legislators and Mutual Benefit agents.   More clashes erupt over severance nowadays because scoresof corporations are running into financial trouble just aspublic outrage is swelling over soaring executive pay. Bigexit packages often mean management gets &quot;rewarded forfailure. That's very hard to swallow,&quot; says Ralph Whitworth,president of the United Shareholders Association. &quot;It's justpure greed.&quot;   Large companies usually offer terminated top executivesbetween one and two years of salary and bonus as severancepay. Golden parachutes, triggered by a takeover or otherchange in control, are richer: They typically cover aboutthree years' pay and bonus.   More than half of the nation's biggest companies havegolden parachutes, up from 35% in 1987, according toExecutive Compensation Reports. In a recent survey by thenewsletter, five officers at Baxter International Inc., thecompany in the study with the biggest potential payouts,stood to receive a total of $56.8 million. But the popularityof golden parachutes appears to have peaked, and the perkwill probably vanish by decade's end, says Rhoda Edelman, amanaging director of compensation consultants Pearl Meyer andamp;Partners Inc.   The mounting criticism helps to explain why. UnitedShareholders, an activist group, introduced proxy resolutionsat a dozen major companies last spring in a drive to killgolden parachutes that lack shareholder approval. Themeasures won support from an average of 32% of thestockholders voting. Consolidated Freightways Inc., one ofthe group's targets, canceled termination payments valued at$7.4 million for eight senior officers before the resolutioncame to a vote, Mr. Whitworth says.   James R. Allen, a Consolidated Freightways vice president,maintains that the trucking concern acted independently. &quot;Thecompany was currently losing money,&quot; he says, &quot;and we thought{the practice} was inappropriate.&quot;   Meanwhile, attacks on other fronts are increasing. InSeptember, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. suggested arule that would prevent sick banks and savings and loanassociations from paying golden parachutes to exitingexecutives. The ban would cover insolvent institutions andthose close to insolvency.   Without waiting for a specific ban, federal bankingregulators have been cracking down on extravagant severancearrangements. Over the past few years, they have ordereddozens of institutions to reduce their intended largess, haltpayments or seek refunds from former officers.   Some executives refuse to relinquish the money without afight, though. Consider Charles Zwick, ousted in January asthe $500,000-a-year chairman and chief executive of SoutheastBanking Corp. Though its banks have since failed, Southeastwas once Florida's leading corporate lender. Mr. Zwick leftafter signing a severance agreement that gave him 30 monthlypayments of $41,667, or $1.25 million.   Beleaguered Southeast, facing regulatory and shareholderpressure, halted his checks last spring. Mr. Zwick turnedaround and sued his former company for reneging on the pact.&quot;If you have an employment contract with somebody and you areterminated, you should be compensated,&quot; argues Gerald J.Houlihan, Mr. Zwick's attorney. &quot;But in this environment,there is no constituency for executives who make a lot ofmoney.&quot;   Regulators deny that they exceeded their power by blockinga legal contract. &quot;It's a little difficult to justifycomfortable golden parachutes&quot; at a failing institution, saysRalph Sharpe, who heads the enforcement compliance divisionfor the comptroller of the currency.   Pan Am's Mr. Plaskett was a bit more successful inovercoming criticism of the holding company's severance andretention-bonus plan. The February proposal, covering about180 executives, would have cost $14 million. &quot;We expected{the plan} to be in place by March,&quot; Mr. Plaskett recalls.   But creditors wanted 32 top officers to receive sixmonths' salary as severance instead of the one to three yearsof pay proposed by Pan Am. In early July, negotiations aboutMr. Plaskett's own package broke down. &quot;He almost didn't getanything&quot; because he kept making inaccurate projections and&quot;there was arrogance in how he dealt with the committee,&quot;contends Leon Marcus, an attorney for the creditorscommittee.   &quot;I think that's an overstatement,&quot; counters Mr. Plaskett.He adds that he cooperated fully with creditors.   Mr. Plaskett ultimately received a boost from Delta AirLines Inc., which agreed to buy most of Pan Am last summer.Delta threatened to walk out of the deal unless aseverance-pay plan went through. A compromise, cleared by aU.S. bankruptcy judge in September, will cost about $10million and give Mr. Plaskett's senior colleagues severancefor a year.   The flap over severance pay underscores executives'financial risks when a business runs into difficulty. Peoplethink they're protected against corporate failure, notes AlanJohnson, managing director, compensation, at recruiters GKRInternational. &quot;They have no {assured} protection at all.&quot;   To insulate themselves from risk, more executives aredemanding a hefty sign-up bonus, dubbed a &quot;golden hello.&quot;After leaving Chrysler Corp. as vice chairman in May 1990,Gerald Greenwald received $5 million to head a proposedemployee buy-out of UAL Corp. As part of the deal, he got $4million more when the buy-out fell through last fall. AllenI. Questrom won a $2 million sign-up bonus for taking overFederated Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp. justafter the Campeau Corp. units filed for bankruptcy courtprotection last year.   A number of major companies have also begun to buyinsurance policies or set up complex trusts enabling topofficers to collect their promised pensions and deferredcompensation no matter what happens. It's basically costlyprotection against the death of a corporation. TBG Financial,a Los Angeles insurance broker, reports that 10 companieshave bought its &quot;Executive Security Account&quot; and more than 30others are considering the life-insurance arrangement sincethe account was introduced about 18 months ago.   Still, some gutsy executives remain willing to take theirchances. W. John Devine, chief executive of Child World Inc.,and his chief operating officer, Ronald E. Tuchman, could ownabout 17.5% of the stock on a fully diluted basis if thestruggling toy chain recovers. Mr. Devine says he didn't seekany front-end cash or special compensation protection when hejoined Child World last spring. &quot;If I am not successful,&quot; heexplains, &quot;I don't know that I am entitled to much.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
