For this reason,the collection of information contained in these regulations has been reviewedand, pending receipt and evaluation of public comments, approved by theOffice of Management and Budget (OMB) under control number 1545-1131. Theestimated annual burden per recordkeeper varies from thirty minutes to1 hour, depending on individual circumstances, with an estimated averageof 40 minutes.

These regulations are necessary to providetaxpayers with immediate guidance in the application of changes made bythe Tax Reform Act of 1986 (Pub. L. No. 99-514, 100 Stat. 2085). Therefore,good cause is found to dispense with the notice and public procedure requirementsof 5 U.S.C. 553 (b) and (d). <ITAG tagnum="84">Explanation of Provisions </ITAG>The Tax Reform Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-514, 100 Stat. 2085, enactedsubpart J of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to replace an incompleteand sometimes contradictory body of statutory, judicial, and administrativelaw governing foreign currency transactions with a coherent statutory regime.The framework of subpart J, derived in part from the Treasury DepartmentDiscussion Draft on Taxing Foreign Exchange Gains and Losses, Announcement81-4, 1981-2 I.R.B. 37, essentially provides that the tax treatment ofa foreign currency denominated transaction turns on the identity of a taxpayer'sfunctional currency, as determined under section 985. The translation oftaxable income or loss, foreign taxes, earnings and profits, and otheritems is determined under sections 986 and 987. Exchange gain or loss isrealized on a transaction-by-transaction basis in the case of transactionsinvolving certain financial assets, liabilities, or financial products(section 988 transactions) that are denominated in, or determined by referenceto, a nonfunctional currency. These temporary regulations implement section988 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, which defines such financialtransactions and provides rules for the timing (in certain cases), character,and source of gain or loss that generally is due to fluctuations in exchangerates. The temporary regulations also provide rules for certain integratedhedging transactions. Section 1.988-1T defines the financial transactions (section 988 transactions)that are subject to the rules of section 988, and contains certain otherdefinitions and rules of general application. Section 1.988-2T providesrules governing the computation of exchange gain or loss realized on asection 988 transaction. Section 1.988-3T provides rules concerning thecharacter of exchange gain or loss realized on a section 988 transaction.Section 1.988-4T provides rules governing the source of exchange gain orloss realized on a section 988 transaction. Section 1.988-5T provides rulesconcerning integrated hedging transactions. Section 1.988-1T Certain Definitions and Special Rules Section 1.988-1T(a) defines the term ``section 988 transaction'' as a dispositionof nonfunctional currency (the acquisition of nonfunctional currency istreated as a section 988 transaction for purposes of establishing the taxpayer'sbasis in such currency) and the following transactions if any amount whichthe taxpayer is entitled to receive or is required to pay is denominatedin terms of a nonfunctional currency or is determined by reference to thevalue of one or more nonfunctional currencies. The transactions referredto in the preceding sentence are: (1) Acquiring a debt instrument or becoming the obligor under a debt instrument.(2) Accruing, or otherwise taking into account for purposes of subtitleA of the Internal Revenue Code, any item of expense or gross income orreceipts which is to be paid or received after the date on which so accruedor taken into account. Section 1.988-1T(a)(2)(ii) clarifies that an accrualof foreign taxes and a payable or receivable relating to a capital expenditureor receipt are within the meaning of the preceding sentence. (3) Entering into or acquiring any forward contract, futures contract,option, warrant, or similar financial instrument. Section 1.988-1T(a)(2)(iii)(A)describes an important limitation on the scope of section 988. This ruleprovides that a forward contract, futures contract, option, warrant, orsimilar financial instrument is within the definition of a section 988transaction only if the underlying property to which the instrument ultimatelyrelates is a nonfunctional currency or is otherwise described in andSection;1.988-1T(a)(1)(ii). Thus, a forward contract to purchase wheat denominatedin a nonfunctional currency is not a section 988 transaction because theunderlying property to which the contract relates is wheat, even thoughpayments required to be made under the contract are denominated in a nonfunctionalcurrency. On the other hand, a forward contract to purchase a nonfunctionalcurrency is a section 988 transaction because the underlying property towhich the contract relates is a nonfunctional currency. Section 1.988-1T(a)(2)(iii)(B)provides that the term ``similar financial instrument'' includes a notionalprincipal contract if the payments required to be made under the contractare determined with reference to a nonfunctional currency. Adoption ofthis rule results in the clarification of the character and source of gainor loss realized with respect to such contracts.Section 1.988-1T(a) (4) and (5) implement the amendments made to section988 by section 6130 of the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988,Pub. L. No. 100-647, 102 Stat. 3342. Section 1.988-1T(a)(4)(i) providesthe general rule that the term ``section 988 transaction'' does not includeany regulated futures contract or nonequity option which would be markedto market under section 1256 if held on the last day of the taxable year.However, under andSection; 1.988-1T(a)(4)(ii), the taxpayer may elect notto have this provision apply. The time and procedure for making this electionare set forth in andSection; 1.988-1T(a)(4) (iii) and (iv). Section 1.988-1T(a)(5)provides special rules relating to qualified funds. Section 1.988-1T(a)(6) provides that a transaction entered into by an individualwhich otherwise qualifies as a section 988 transaction shall be considereda section 988 transaction only to the extent expenses properly allocableto such transaction meet the requirements of section 162 or 212 (otherthan the part of section 212 dealing with expenses incurred in connectionwith taxes). Section 1.988-1T(a)(7) provides rules concerning intra-taxpayer transactions.The general rule is that transactions between or among branches of thesame taxpayer are not section 988 transactions. Such transactions generallyare governed by the rules of section 987 and the regulations thereunder.However, exchange gain or loss is realized under section 988 upon the transferof certain third party items to another qualified business unit of thetaxpayer. See section 987 concerning the treatment of any gain or lossresulting from a remittance. Section 1.988-1T(a)(8) provides a general anti-abuse rule which allowsthe Commissioner to recharacterize certain transactions if their effectis to avoid section 988. For example, a taxpayer holding an asset subjectto section 988 may transfer such asset to a corporation or partnershipin a transaction in which gain or loss is not recognized and subsequentlysell the stock of such corporation or the interest in the partnership realizingcapital gain or loss. If the Commissioner concludes that the effect ofsuch transaction is to avoid section 988, the Commissioner may recharacterizethe transaction in whole or in part as a section 988 transaction. Similarly,the Commissioner may recharacterize a transaction that otherwise wouldbe a section 988 transaction as one that is not a section 988 transaction.Section 1.988-1T(b) sets forth the definition of spot contract. A spotcontract is a contract to buy or sell nonfunctional currency on or beforetwo business days following the date of the execution of the contract.The operative rules regarding spot contracts are provided in andSection;1.988-2T(d)(1)(ii). Section 1.988-1T(c) defines the term ``nonfunctional currency'' as a currency(including the European Currency Unit) other than a taxpayer's functionalcurrency. The nonrecognition rules of section 988(c)(1)(C)(ii) are setforth in andSection; 1.988-2T(a)(1)(iii). Section 1.988-1T(d) defines the term ``spot rate'', a critical term inmany of the computations required under section 988. Generally, the spotrate is the rate demonstrated to the satisfaction of the District Directorwhich represents a fair market rate of exchange available to the publicfor currency under a spot contract in a free market and involving representativeamounts. However, if a currency has an official government establishedspot rate that differs from a free market rate, the spot rate is the ratewhich most properly reflects the taxpayer's income. Section 1.988-1T(d)(3)in conjunction with andSection; 1.988-2T(c) allows a taxpayer to use a spotrate convention in determining exchange gain or loss with respect to payablesand receivables denominated in a nonfunctional currency so long as themethod is consistent with the taxpayer's financial accounting and the payablesor receivables are incurred in the ordinary course of business with respectto the acquisition or sale of goods or the obtaining or performance ofservices. The spot rate under the convention must be determined at intervalsof one month or less. Section 1.988-1T(d)(2) requires consistency withrespect to the source of market rate quotations.Section 1.988-1T(e) sets forth the definition of ``exchange gain or loss.''The section 988 regulations use this term in place of the statutory terms``foreign currency gain'' and ``foreign currency loss'' to clarify thatsection 988 applies to transactions denominated in the U.S. dollar if thedollar is a nonfunctional currency to the taxpayer. Section 1.988-1T(f) defines ``hyperinflationary currency'' by referenceto andSection; 1.985-2T(b)(2) or its successor. Section 1.988-1T(g) requires that in determining the fair market valueof any section 988 transaction (including any transaction described inandSection; 1.988-5T) that is marked to market (i.e., treated as sold forits fair market value), the time value of money must be taken into accountwhere relevant. Section 1.988-2T Recognition and Computation of Exchange Gain or Loss <ITAG tagnum="81">Nonfunctional Currency </ITAG>Section 1.988-2T(a) provides rules governing the recognition and computationof exchange gain or loss with respect to dispositions of nonfunctionalcurrency. Section 1.988-2T(a)(1) provides the general rule that the recognition ofexchange gain or loss upon the sale or other disposition of nonfunctionalcurrency is governed by the recognition provisions of the Code which applyto the sale or disposition of property. Pursuant to section 988(c)(1)(C)(ii),andSection; 1.988-2T(a)(1)(iii) provides certain exceptions to this generalrule. Section 1.988-2T(a)(2)(i) provides that exchange gain realized from thesale or other disposition of nonfunctional currency is the excess of theamount realized over the adjusted basis of such currency, and that exchangeloss realized is the excess of the adjusted basis of such currency overthe amount realized. Section 1.988-2T(a)(2)(ii)(A) provides that the amountrealized is determined under section 1001(b). Section 1.988-2T(a)(2)(ii)(B)provides a special rule where nonfunctional currency is exchanged for property.An exchange of nonfunctional currency for property (other than nonfunctionalcurrency) is treated as an exchange of the units of nonfunctional currencyfor units of functional currency at the spot rate on the date of the exchangeand the purchase or sale of the property for such units of functional currency.Generally, the adjusted basis of nonfunctional currency is determined underthe applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (<T3>e.g., </T3>sections 1011 through 1024). However, andSection; 1.988-2T(a)(2)(iii)(B)allows a taxpayer to determine the functional currency basis of nonfunctionalcurrency withdrawn from an account with a bank or other financial institutionunder any reasonable method that is consistently applied from year to yearto all accounts of the taxpayer. Section 1.988-2T(a)(2)(iv) provides a special rule for purchases and salesof publicly traded stock or securities by a cash basis taxpayer. Underthis rule, the amount realized with respect to the sale of such stock orsecurities (determined on the trade date under section 453(k)) is computedby translating the units of nonfunctional currency received into functionalcurrency at the spot rate on the settlement date of the sale. Similarly,the basis of stock or securities purchased is determined by translatingthe units of nonfunctional currency paid into functional currency at thespot rate on the settlement date of the purchase. Absent this special rule,a cash basis taxpayer would have to recognize exchange gain or loss onthe payable or receivable that would arise on the trade date and end onthe settlement date. <ITAG tagnum="81">Debt Instruments </ITAG>Section 1.988-2T(b) provides rules regarding the translation of interestincome or expense and the determination of exchange gain or loss with respectto debt instruments. Generally, these rules follow the framework set forthin the Senate Finance Committee Report to the Tax Reform Act of 1986, S.Rep. No. 99-313, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 461. Section 1.988-2T(b)(1) providesa rule for the administrative convenience of both taxpayers and the Servicefor interest income received with respect to a nonfunctional currency denominateddemand account with a bank or other financial institution. Interest incomereceived or accrued with respect to such account is translated at the spotrate on the date received or accrued or pursuant to any reasonable spotrate convention consistently applied by the taxpayer to accounts in thesame financial institution. This rule applies regardless of whether thetaxpayer is a cash or an accrual method taxpayer. No exchange gain or lossis realized with respect to interest income received or accrued with respectto a demand account with a bank or other financial institution. Of course,exchange gain or loss is realized under andSection; 1.988-2T(a) when unitsof nonfunctional currency received as interest are disposed of. Section 1.988-2T(b) (2) through (8) provide the general rules applicableto debt instruments. Under andSection; 1.988-2T(b)(2)(i), these rules onlyapply to debt instruments where all payments are denominated in, or determinedby reference to, a single nonfunctional currency (referred to in this preambleas a ``section 988 debt instrument''). Further, these rules do not applyto a contingent payment debt instrument. For purposes of section 988, adebt instrument is not considered a contingent payment debt instrumentmerely because some or all of the payments are denominated in, or determinedby reference to, a nonfunctional currency. It is anticipated that theserules will be coordinated with temporary or final regulations issued underauthority of section 1275(d) which address contingent payment debt instrumentswhen such regulations are issued. Section 1.988-2T(b)(2)(ii)(A) provides the general rule that interest incomeor expense (including original issue discount) on a section 988 debt instrumentis determined in units of nonfunctional currency and translated into functionalcurrency as provided in andSection; 1.988-2T(b)(2)(ii) (B) and (C). Thus,a section 988 debt instrument is not considered a contingent payment instrumentmerely because the instrument is denominated in a nonfunctional currency.Section 1.988-2T(b)(2)(ii)(A) also provides that, for purposes of sections483, 1273(b)(5) and 1274, the nonfunctional currency in which an instrumentis denominated shall be considered money. Accordingly, section 1274 doesnot apply merely because a debt instrument is issued for nonfunctionalcurrency. Under andSection; 1.988-2T(b)(2)(ii) (B) and (C), interest income or expensethat is not required to be accrued prior to receipt or payment (<T3>e.g., </T3>because the taxpayer is on the cash method of accountingand the instrument does not have any original issue discount) is translatedat the spot rate on the date of receipt or payment. Since the taxpayerdoes not accrue such payments, there is no exchange gain or loss undersection 988(c)(1)(B)(ii). Interest income or expense that is required tobe accrued prior to receipt or payment (<T3>e.g., </T3>under section 1272, 1281, or 163(e) or because the taxpayeris on the accrual method of accounting) is translated at the average ratefor the accrual period. Under andSection; 1.988-2T(b) (3) and (4), exchangegain or loss is realized with respect to such accrued interest income orexpense. Exchange gain or loss is also realized with respect to the principalamount of a section 988 debt instrument pursuant to andSection; 1.988-2T(b)(5) and (6) regardless of whether the taxpayer is on the cash or accrualmethod of accounting.Section 1.988-2T(b)(7) provides payment ordering rules. In the case ofa section 988 debt instrument that is subject to the rules of sections163(e) or 1272 through 1288, units of nonfunctional currency received orpaid are treated first as a receipt or payment of periodic interest underthe principles of section 1273, second as a receipt or payment of originalissue discount to the extent accrued, and finally as a receipt or paymentof principal. A second ordering rule is provided for the case where originalissue discount has accrued for more than one accrual period and the paymentis less than the total amount accrued. Under this rule, the payment isattributed to the earliest accrual period in which original issue discounthas accrued and to which prior payments have not been attributed. In thecase of a section 988 debt instrument that is not subject to the rulesof sections 163(e) or 1272 through 1288, section 163 or other applicablesection shall determine whether payments made or received shall be treatedas interest. Section 1.988-2T(b)(8) implements the statutory ``netting'' rule of section988(b) (1) and (2). See, H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 99-841, 99th Cong., 2d Sess.,Vol. II, pp. 663 through 664. Under the netting rule, exchange gain orloss is recognized upon disposition of a section 988 debt instrument onlyto the extent of the total gain or loss recognized on the disposition.For illustrations of this rule, see Examples (3), (4) and (6) of andSection;1.988-2T(b)(9). Section 1.988-2T(b)(10) provides rules concerning the treatment of amortizabledbond premium with respect to a section 988 debt instrument. Amortizablebond premium is computed in the units of nonfunctional currency in whichthe bond is denominated. Amortizable bond premium properly taken into accountunder section 171 or andSection; 1.61-12 reduces interest income or expensein units of nonfunctional currency. In addition, exchange gain or lossis recognized with respect to such bond premium by treating the portionof the premium amortized as a return of principal. Section 1.988-2T(b)(11) provides rules concerning the treatment of marketdiscount with respect to a section 988 debt instrument. Accrued marketdiscount (other than market discount currently included in income pursuantto section 1278(b)(8)) is translated into functional currency at the spotrate on the date the instrument is disposed of. No exchange gain or lossis realized because such market discount is not taken into income priorto receipt. Accrued market discount currently includible in income pursuantto section 1278(b) is translated into functional currency at the averageexchange rate for the accrual period. Exchange gain or loss is realizedwith respect to market discount currently includible in income. Section 1.988-2T(b)(13) provides rules requiring the recognition of exchangegain or loss by both the holder and the obligor when a section 988 debtinstrument is exchanged for stock, even if the exchange otherwise wouldbe a nonrecognition transaction. Because the sale or redemption of stockis not a section 988 transaction, taxation at the time of the exchangeis necessary to prevent any exchange gain or loss inherent in the debtinstrument from escaping subpart J treatment. Section 1.988-2T(b)(14), dealing with the treatment of exchange gain orloss when nonfunctional currency debt is exchanged for debt of the sameobligor, is reserved. The Service is interested in receiving comments onthe appropriate tax treatment of exchange gain or loss on such transactions,including correlative adjustments to prevent double counting in the computationof bond premium or discount and discharge of indebtedness income, whetheror not the exchange qualifies as a recapitalization under section 368 (a)(1)(E).<ITAG tagnum="81">Payables and Receivables </ITAG>Section 1.988-2T(c) provides rules for the realization and determinationof exchange gain or loss with respect to an item described in andSection;1.988-1T(a) (1)(ii) and (2)(ii) (<T3>e.g., </T3>payables and receivables denominated in a nonfunctionalcurrency). Generally, exchange gain or loss is determined with respectto the movements in exchange rates between the date an item is booked andthe date it is paid. Section 1.988-2T(c) (2) and (3) allows taxpayers touse a spot rate convention in determining the exchange gain or loss withrespect to payables and receivables. <ITAG tagnum="81">Forwards, Futures, and Options </ITAG>Section 1.988-2T(d) provides rules for the determination of exchange gainor loss with respect to forward contracts, futures contracts and optioncontracts described in andSection; 1.988-1T(a) (1)(ii) and (2)(iii) (referredto in this preamble as section 988 forward, futures, and option contracts).Section 1.988-2T(d)(1)(ii)  provides that a spot contract to buy or sellnonfunctional currency is not considered a forward contract or similartransaction unless the spot contract is disposed of prior to making ortaking delivery. Thus, exchange gain or loss is not recognized with respectto such contract when a taxpayer makes or takes delivery of nonfunctionalcurrency under a spot contract. Exchange gain or loss is realized underandSection; 1.988-2T(a) on the disposition of the units of nonfunctionalcurrency. Section 1.988-2T(d)(2)(i) provides that exchange gain or loss with respectto a section 988 forward, futures, or option contract is realized in accordancewith the applicable realization section of the Code (<T3>e.g., </T3>sections 988(c)(5), 1001, 1092, and 1256). Section 1.988-2T(d)(2)(ii) clarifies the rules regarding when an offset is considered to result ina realization event. Generally, exchange gain or loss with respect to asection 988 forward, futures, or option contract is not realized solelybecause such contract is offset by another contract. However, under andSection;1.988-2T(d)(2)(ii)(B), if the taxpayer derives, by pledge or otherwise,an economic benefit from any gain inherent in the offsetting contracts,then exchange gain shall be realized. No inference is intended by andSection;1.988-2T (d)(2)(ii)(B) with respect to the application of prior law tooffsetting contracts where the taxpayer derives an economic benefit fromany gain inherent in such contracts. Exchange gain or loss is realizedwith respect to certain exchange traded contracts if it is the generalpractice of the exchange to terminate offsetting contracts. Section 1.988-2T(d)(2)(iv) provides that an extension of the time for makingor taking delivery under a section 988 forward, futures, or option contractis a realization event. Thus, historical rate rollovers result in the realizationof exchange gain or loss on the rollover date. Exchange gain or loss with respect to a section 988 forward, futures, oroption contract is determined by subtracting the amount paid (or deemedpaid) for or with respect to the contract from the amount received (ordeemed received) for or with respect to such contract. The treatment of an exchange of futures for physicals is reserved. TheService solicits comments with respect to the appropriate treatment ofsuch transactions. <ITAG tagnum="81">Currency Swaps and Notional Principal Contracts </ITAG>In general, exchange gain or loss with respect to notional principal contractsis determined in accordance with the taxpayer's method of accounting, solong as that method clearly reflects income. See generally Notice 89-21,1989-8 I.R.B. 23. Section 1.988-2T(e)(2) provides special rules for determiningexchange gain or loss with respect to currency swaps. A currency swap isdefined by reference to andSection; 1.988-5T(a)(4)(ii). The rules governing the timing and computation of currency swap incomeand expense adopt many of the concepts that are applicable to debt instruments.Thus, under andSection; 1.988-2T(e)(2)(ii)(A), the timing and computationof the periodic interim payments in a currency swap are determined by treatingthe taxpayer as the obligor of a hypothetical debt instrument (the obligationto make payments under the currency swap contract) and the holder of asecond hypothetical debt instrument (the right to receive payments underthe contract). The general rules regarding the amortization of interestand the computation of exchange gain or loss on interest apply to the hypotheticalinterest from such hypothetical debt instruments. These rules apply todetermine the appropriate timing and computation of gain or loss and notfor purposes of characterizing such gain or loss.Under andSection; 1.988-2T(e)(2)(iii), the general rules governing debt instrumentsapply for purposes of determining the amount of exchange gain or loss withrespect to the currency swap principal amount. Exchange gain or loss isrealized on the day the units of swap principal are exchanged (except uponan equal exchange of the swap principal amount at the commencement of theagreement at a market exchange rate). The amount of exchange gain or lossis determined by subtracting the value of the units of swap principal paidfrom the value of the units of swap principal received. Section 1.988-2T(e)(2)(ii)(B)treats certain prepayments as loans for purposes of section 956. Section 1.988-2T(e)(3) provides special rules regarding the amortizationof currency swap premium or discount in the case of an ``off-market'' currencyswap. A currency swap is ``off-market'' if (absent the swap premium ordiscount) the present value of the payments to be made is not equal tothe present value of the payments to be received (generally as a resultof interest rate or exchange rate movements). In order for the partiesto agree to enter into an off-market swap, one party usually pays to anothera premium or receives a discount so that the present values of the amountsexchanged are equal. Under andSection; 1.988-2T(e)(3)(ii)(A), a taxpayerentering into or acquiring an off-market currency swap includes that partof the swap premium or discount that relates to exchange rate movementson the date the swap principal amounts are taken into account. Under andSection;1.988-2T(e)(3)(ii)(B), a taxpayer entering into or acquiring an off-marketcurrency swap amortizes that part of the swap premium or discount thatrelates to interest rate movements in a manner consistent with the principlesof economic accrual. Under andSection; 1.988-2T(e)(3)(iii), a taxpayer disposingof a currency swap treats any gain or loss realized as exchange gain orloss. Section 1.988-2T(f) provides for the recharacterization of transactionsdescribed in andSection; 1.988-1T(a)(1)(ii) where necessary to accuratelyreflect the economic substance of the transactions. See also andSection;1.861-9T(b)(1). Section 1.988-3T Character of Exchange Gain or Loss <ITAG tagnum="81">General Rules </ITAG>The character of exchange gain or loss recognized on a section 988 transactionis governed by section 988 regardless of any other section of the Code.Under section 988, exchange gain or loss is generally characterized asordinary gain or loss. <ITAG tagnum="81">Special Election </ITAG>Under andSection; 1.988-3T(b)(1), a taxpayer may elect to treat any gainor loss on a section 988 forward, futures, or option contract as capitalgain or loss but only if the contract is a capital asset in the hands ofthe taxpayer, is not part of a straddle, and is not a regulated futurescontract or nonequity option with respect to which an election under section988(c)(1)(D)(ii) is in effect. However, if such contract becomes part ofa straddle after the date of the election, the election shall be invalidwith respect to gains from the contract and the Commissioner may invalidatethe election with respect to losses. Section 1.988-3T(b)(3) provides that a taxpayer makes the election by clearlyidentifying the transaction on its books and records on the date the transactionis entered into. No specific language or account is required but the methodof identification must be consistently applied by the taxpayer and mustclearly identify the transaction. A taxpayer that has made an electionmust verify each election as provided in andSection; 1.988-3T(b)(4) by attachingto his income tax return a statement setting forth the information specifiedin such section. <ITAG tagnum="81">Exchange Gain or Loss Treated as Interest </ITAG>Generally, exchange gain or loss is not treated as interest income or expense.However, exchange gain or loss is treated as interest income or expenseas provided in andSection; 1.861-9T, andSection; 1.988-2T(e)(2)(ii)(B), andSection;1.988-5T and in administrative pronouncements of the Service. Further,exchange loss realized by the holder of a nonfunctional currency tax exemptbond is treated as an offset to interest income on the bond and to thatextent is not recognized. Section 1.988-4T Source of Gain or Loss Realized on a Section 988 TransactionSection 1.988-4T(a) provides the general rule that the source of exchangegain or loss is determined by reference to the residence of the taxpayer.Section 1.988-4T(b) provides an exception to this rule in the case of anasset, liability, or item of income or expense that is properly reflectedon the books of a qualified business unit. In such case, the residenceof the qualified business unit, generally the country in which the principalplace of business of the qualified business unit is located, controls.Whether an asset, liability, or item of income or expense is properly reflectedon the books of a qualified business unit is a question of fact. Section1.988-4T(b)(2)(ii) requires consistency in the taxpayer's booking practices.Section 1.988-4T(c) provides a second exception to residence based sourcing.Exchange gain or loss that under the principles of andSection; 1.864-4(c)arises from the conduct of a United States trade or business is sourcedin the United States and treated as effectively connected to the conductof a United States trade or business for purposes of sections 871(b) and882(a) (1). Residence is defined in andSection; 1.988-4T(d). Special rules are providedin the case of a partnership formed or availed of to avoid tax by alteringthe source of exchange gain or loss. The source of such gain or loss isdetermined by reference to the residence of the partners rather than thepartnership.Section 1.988-4T(e) provides rules for certain high interest related partyloans. For purposes of section 904 only, such loans are marked to marketannually on the earlier of the last business day of the taxable year orthe date the loan matures. Any interest income earned with respect to theloan for the taxable year is U.S. source to the extent of any notionalloss attributable to the loan under paragraph (e)(1) of that section. Theoperation of section 988(a)(3)(C) with respect to loans between relatedforeign subsidiaries is reserved. The Service solicits comments with regardto the application of this rule to these transactions. Under andSection; 1.988-4T(f), any gain or loss realized on a section 988transaction that is treated as interest income or expense under andSection;1.988-3T(c)(1) is sourced or allocated and apportioned pursuant to section861(a)(1), 862(a) (1), or 864(e), as the case may be. Section 1.988-5T  Section 988(d) Hedging Transactions Section 1.988-5T implements section 988(d), which provides for integratedtreatment of certain hedging transactions. Section 1.988-5T(a) providesfor the integration of a hedge with a nonfunctional currency debt instrument.Section 1.988-5T(b) provides for the integration of a hedge with an executorycontract. Section 1.988-5T(c) provides integration rules for cash basistaxpayers that hedge exchange rate exposure on stock transactions betweenthe trade date and the settlement date. <ITAG tagnum="81">Integrated Financial Transactions </ITAG>Section 1.988-5T(a) permits integrated treatment only for a qualifyingdebt instrument, defined in andSection; 1.988-5T(a) (3), and certain hedges,defined in andSection; 1.988-5T(a)(4). A qualifying debt instrument is adebt instrument defined in andSection;1.988-2T(b)(2)(i) and does not includeaccounts payable, accounts receivable or similar items. The hedges thatqualify for integrated treatment are certain spot contracts, futures contracts,forward contracts, series or combinations thereof, or a currency swap contract.Section 1.988-5T(a) (4) requires that the hedge mature on or before thedate the debt instrument matures and that the hedge permit the calculationof a yield to maturity in the currency in which the integrated debt instrumentis denominated. Section 1.988-5T(a)(4)(ii) defines a currency swap contract as a contractinvolving two different currencies between two or more parties to exchangeperiodic interim payments on or prior to maturity of the contract and toexchange the swap principal amount upon maturity of the contract. A currencyswap contract may also require an exchange of the swap principal amountupon commencement of the agreement. Under andSection; 1.988-5T (a)(4)(iii),the currency swap contract must clearly set forth certain essential termsof the contract; otherwise the Commissioner may defer any income, deduction,gain or loss with respect to the contract until its termination. A taxpayermay apply this definition of currency swap contract in lieu of the definitionof swap agreement in section 2(e)(5) of Notice 87-11, 1987-1 C.B. 423,to transactions entered into after December 31, 1986. Sections 1.988-5T(a)(2), (5), and (8) impose certain conditions on theavailability of integrated treatment. Section 1.988-5T(a)(2) denies integratedtreatment where the resulting synthetic asset or liability would be denominatedin a currency whose interest rate is at least 20 percentage points higherthan the Federal short term rate (generally, such currencies include hyperinflationarycurrencies) on the date the taxpayer identifies the transaction as a qualifiedhedging transaction. Among other conditions imposed by andSection; 1.988-5T(a)(5), andSection; 1.988-5T(a)(5)(i)requires that all nonfunctional currency payments must be fully hedged.Section 1.988-5T (a)(5)(ii) requires that the hedge be entered on the datethe transaction is identified as a qualified hedging transaction. Noneof the parties to the hedge can be related. Both the qualifyng debt instrumentand the hedge must be entered into by the same individual, partnership,trust, estate, or corporation. Section 1.988-5T(a)(8)(i) requires thata taxpayer establish a separate account in which to enter certain informationrelating to debt instruments and hedges that are integrated. Section 1.988-5T(a)(8)(ii) authorizes the Commissioner to treat a debtinstrument and a hedge as integrated if he concludes that the debt instrumentand the hedge are, in substance, a qualified hedging transaction. Thisauthority exists regardless of whether the requirements for integratedtreatment are complied with, or whether the qualifying debt instrumentand the hedge are held by the same taxpayer. At the discretion of the Commissioner,section 1.988-5T(a)(7) denies integrated treatment to a debt instrumentif it is part of a straddle as defined in section 1092(c) prior to thesatisfaction of the identification requirements.Section 1.988-5T(a)(6) contains special rules for ``legging in'' and ``leggingout'' of integrated treatment. Legging in occurs when the hedge is enteredinto after the date the debt instrument is entered into or acquired. Insuch case, andSection; 1.988-5T(a)(6)(i) provides that the gain or loss inherentin the debt instrument at the time of legging in must be realized on thatdate and recognized on the date that the qualifying debt instrument maturesor is otherwise disposed of. Legging out occurs when the debt instrumentor hedge receiving integrated treatment is disposed of prior to the maturityof the synthetic debt instrument. In such case, andSection; 1.988-5T(a)(6)(ii)provides that gain or loss on the instrument that was not disposed of isrealized and recognized at the time of legging out. The spot rate on thatdate is used to compute exchange gain or loss on the remaining instrumentupon its disposition. The income tax effects of integrated treatment are detailed in andSection;1.988-5T(a)(9). If a debt instrument and a hedge qualify for integratedtreatment, the two are treated as a single synthetic debt instrument thatis subject to the original issue discount provisions of sections 1272 through1288 and 163(e), to the extent applicable. Section 1.9885-T(a)(9)(ii) describesthe denomination, maturity, accrual period, issue price, and stated redemptionprice at maturity of the synthetic debt instrument. If the synthetic debtinstrument is denominated in a nonfunctional currency, exchange gain orloss is computed on the synthetic debt instrument in accordance with thegeneral rules for debt instruments. For the period the debt instrumentand the hedge are integrated, by operation of andSection; 1.988-5T(a)(1),no exchange gain or loss is recognized independently on either the debtinstrument or the hedge, and by operation of andSection; 1.988-5T(a)(9)(i)(A)neither the debt instrument nor the hedge are subject to section 263(g),1092 or 1256. Under andSection; 1.988-5T(a)(9)(iii), the source of interest income fromthe synthetic debt instrument is determined by reference to the sourceof income under sections 861(a)(1) and 862(a)(1) from the debt instrument.The character for purposes of section 904 also is determined by referenceto the character of the debt instrument. Interest expense from a syntheticdebt instrument is allocated and apportioned under andSection; 1.861-8T to-12T, and, if applicable, andSection; 1.882-5. <ITAG tagnum="81">Hedged Executory Contracts </ITAG>Section 1.988-5T(b) provides integrated treatment of an executory contractand a hedge. An executory contract is defined in andSection; 1.988-5T(b)(2)(ii),and generally is an agreement for the purchase or sale of property or theperformance or receipt of a service in the future. Section 1.988-5T(b)(2)(ii)(B)excludes section 988 transactions from the definition of an executory contract.Section 1.988-5T(b)(2)(iii)(A) defines a hedge as a deposit of nonfunctionalcurrency in a separate account with a bank or other financial institution,and certain forward or futures contracts, that reduce the risk of exchangerate fluctuations by reference to the taxpayer's functional currency withrespect to payments made or received under an executory contract. Integrated treatment is accorded only if the executory contract is hedgedin whole or in part through the accrual date. The accrual date is the datewhen an item of income or expense (including a capital expenditure) thatrelates to an executory contract is required to be accrued under the taxpayer'smethod of accounting. Section 1.988-5T(b)(2) (iii)(B) permits hedging witha series of hedges, and andSection; 1.988-5T(b)(2)(iii)(C) provides analogousrules for historical rate rollovers. Because the amount taken into accountunder the executory contract must be fixed on the accrual date in termsof functional currency, andSection; 1.988-5T(b)(2)(iii)(D) provides thatinterest on a deposit of nonfunctional currency is considered part of ahedge only if it accrues on or before the accrual date. The definitionof ``hedged executory contract'' in andSection; 1.988-5T(b)(2)(i) and theidentification rules in andSection; 1.988-5T(b)(3) contain further conditionsto integrated treatment that are analogous to those of andSection; 1.988-5T(a).Section 1.988-5T(b)(4)(i) explains that the effect of integrated treatmentof an executory contract and a hedge is to treat amounts paid or receivedunder the hedge as paid or received under the executory contract, or, ifthe hedge extends after the accrual date, under the subsequent accountpayable or receivable. No exchange gain or loss is recognized on the hedgeor on a subsequent account payable or receivable for the period coveredby the hedge. Section 1.988-5T(b)(4)(v) provides that sections 263(g),1092, and 1256 do not apply to the portion of an executory contract anda hedge that receive integrated treatment. If the executory contract ispartially hedged, andSection; 1.988-5T(b)(4)(ii)  applies the general rulesgoverning exchange gain or loss to the unhedged portion of the executorycontract or subsequent payable or receivable. Under andSection; 1.988-5T(b)(4)(iii), if the taxpayer disposes of the executorycontract prior to the accrual date, the hedge is treated as sold for fairmarket value on such date and any gain or loss is realized. If the hedgeis disposed of prior to the accrual date, any gain or loss from the hedgeis not recognized and is an adjustment to the inclusion, deduction, orbasis under the executory contract. Section 1.988-5T(b)(4)(iv) providesthat, upon legging out of the hedge on or after the accrual date, no gainor loss is recognized on the hedge and the booking date of the payableor receivable for purposes of computing exchange gain or loss on such payableor receivable is reset to the date the hedge is disposed of. <ITAG tagnum="81">Hedges of Period Between Trade Date and Settlement Date </ITAG>Section 1.988-5T(c) offers integrated treatment roughly paralleling theabove described rules in the case of a cash basis taxpayer who hedges exchangerate exposure between the trade date and the settlement date on tradesof certain stocks or securities. <ITAG tagnum="81">Mark-to-Market Method of Accounting </ITAG>The Service is contemplating adoption of a mark-to-market method of accountingfor dealers in nonfunctional currency denominated financial products. TheService solicits comments on the scope and methodology of such a method,and whether such method should be applicable to taxpayers other than dealers.<ITAG tagnum="81">Treatment of Unrealized Exchange Gain or Loss in Certain NonrecognitionTransactions </ITAG>The Service is studying the issue of how to account for unrealized exchangegain or loss with respect to nonfunctional currency or any section 988transaction that loses its character as such after certain nonrecognitiontransactions; for example, a liquidation of a wholly-owned foreign corporationwith a nondollar functional currency and with U.S. dollar denominated financialassets into its U.S. parent.<ITAG tagnum="84">Special Analyses </ITAG>It has been determined that these rules are not major rules as definedin Executive Order 12291. Therefore, a Regulatory Impact Analysis is notrequired. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the AdministrativeProcedure Act (5 U.S.C. Chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5U.S.C. Chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations, and, therefore, aRegulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. <ITAG tagnum="84">Drafting Information </ITAG>The principal author of these regulations is Jeffrey Dorfman with the assistanceof Charles T.

Thus, if the underlyingproperty of an instrument is another financial instrument (<T3>e.g., </T3>an option on a futures contract), then the underlying propertyto which such other instrument (<T3>e.g., </T3>the futures contract) ultimately relates must be a nonfunctionalcurrency. For example, a forward contract to purchase wheat denominatedin a nonfunctional currency, an option to enter into a forward contractto purchase wheat denominated in a nonfunctional currency, or a warrantto purchase stock denominated in a nonfunctional currency is not describedin this paragraph (a)(2)(iii). On the other hand, a forward contract topurchase a nonfunctional currency, an option to enter into a forward contractto purchase a nonfunctional currency, an option to purchase a bond denominatedin or the payments of which are determined by reference to the value ofa nonfunctional currency, or a warrant to purchase a nonfunctional currencyis described in this paragraph (a)(2)(iii).

(3)<T3> Examples. </T3>The following examples illustrate the application ofparagraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section. The examples assume that Xis a U.S. corporation on an accrual method with the calendar year as itstaxable year. Because X is a U.S. corporation the U.S. dollar is its functionalcurrency under section 985. The examples also assume that section 988(d)does not apply.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1). </T3>On January 1, 1989, X acquires 10,000 Canadian dollars.On January 15, 1989, X uses the 10,000 Canadian dollars to purchase inventory.The acquisition of the 10,000 Canadian dollars is a section 988 transactionfor purposes of establishing X's basis in such Canadian dollars. The dispositionof the 10,000 Canadian dollars is a section 988 transaction pursuant toparagraph (a)(1) of this section. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2). </T3>On January 1, 1989, X acquires 10,000 Canadian dollars.On January 15, 1989, X converts the 10,000 Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars.The acquisition of the 10,000 Canadian dollars is a section 988 transactionfor purposes of establishing X's basis in such Canadian dollars. The conversionof the 10,000 Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars is a section 988 transactionpursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (3). </T3>On January 1, 1989, X borrows 100,000 British pounds(andCx.13;) for a period of 10 years and issues a note to the lender witha face amount of andCx.13;100,000. The note provides for payments of interestat an annual rate of 10% paid quarterly in pounds and has a stated redemptionprice at maturity of andCx.13;100,000. X's becoming the obligor under thenote is a section 988 transaction pursuant to paragraphs (a) (1)(ii) and(2)(i) of this section. Because X is an accrual basis taxpayer, the accrualof interest expense under X's note is a section 988 transaction pursuantto paragraphs (a) (1)(ii) and (2)(ii) of this section. In addition, theacquisition of the British pounds to make payments under the note is asection 988 transaction for purposes of establishing X's basis in suchpounds, and the disposition of such pounds is a section 988 transactionunder subdivision (a)(1)(i) of this section. See andSection; 1.988-2T(b)with respect to the translation of accrued interest expense and the determinationof exchange gain or loss upon payment of accrued interest expense. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (4). </T3>On January 1, 1989, X purchases at original issuefor 74,621.54 British pounds (andCx.13;) a 3-year bond maturing on December31, 1991, at a stated redemption price of andCx.13;100,000. The bond providesfor no stated interest. The bond has a yield to maturity of 10% compoundedsemiannually and has andCx.13;25,378.46 of original issue discount. The acquisitionof the bond is a section 988 transaction as provided in paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (2)(i) of this section. The accrual of original issue discountwith respect to the bond is a section 988 transaction under paragraphs(a) (1)(ii) and (2)(ii) of this section. See andSection; 1.988-2T(b) withrespect to the translation of original issue discount and the determinationof exchange gain or loss upon receipt of such amounts. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (5). </T3>On January 1, 1989, X sells and delivers inventoryto Y for 10,000,000 Italian lira for payment on April 1, 1989. Under X'smethod of accounting, January 1, 1989 is the accrual date. Because X isan accrual basis taxpayer, the accrual of a nonfunctional currency denominateditem of gross receipts on January 1, 1989, for payment after the date ofaccrual is a section 988 transaction under paragraphs (a) (1)(ii) and (2)(ii)of this section. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (6). </T3>On January 1, 1989, X agrees to purchase a machinefrom Y for delivery on March 1, 1990 for 1,000,000 yen. The agreement callsfor X to pay Y for the machine on June 1, 1990. Under X's method of accounting,the expenditure for the machine does not accrue until delivery on March1, 1990. The agreement to purchase the machine is not a section 988 transaction.In particular, the agreement to purchase the machine is not described inparagraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section because the agreement is not an itemof expense taken into account under subtitle A (but rather is an agreementto purchase a capital asset in the future). However, the payable that willarise on the delivery date is a section 988 transaction under paragraphs(a) (1)(ii) and (2)(ii) of this section even though the payable relatesto a capital expenditure. In addition, the disposition of yen to satisfythe payable on June 1, 1990, is a section 988 transaction under paragraph(a)(1)(i) of this section. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (7). </T3>On January 1, 1989, X purchases and takes deliveryof inventory for 10,000 French francs with payment to be made on April1, 1989.

On January 1, 1989, X also enters into a forward contract witha bank to purchase 10,000 French francs for $2,000 on April 1, 1989. BecauseX is an accrual basis taxpayer, the accrual of a nonfunctional currencydenominated item of expense on January 1, 1989, for payment after the dateof accrual is a section 988 transaction under paragraphs (a) (1)(ii) and(2)(ii) of this section. Entering into the forward contract to purchasethe 10,000 French francs is a section 988 transaction under paragraphs(a) (1)(ii) and (2)(iii) of this section. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (8). </T3>On January 1, 1989, X acquires 100,000 Norwegiankrone.

OnAugust 1, 1989, X sells the 1,000 shares of common stock and receives 120,000krone in payment. On August 30, 1989, X converts the 120,000 krone to U.S.dollars. The acquisition of the 100,000 krone on January 1, 1989, and theacquisition of the 120,000 krone on August 30, 1989, are section 988 transactionsfor purposes of establishing the basis of such krone. The disposition ofthe 100,000 krone on January 15, 1989, and the 120,000 krone on August30, 1989, are section 988 transactions as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(i)of this section. Neither the acquisition on January 15, 1989, nor the dispositionon August 1, 1989, of the stock is a section 988 transaction. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (9). </T3>On January 1, 1989, X issues a 3-year bond with anissue price of 7,260 Australian dollars (equal to U.S. $5,000 translatedat the spot rate on the issue date). The instrument bears interest on theU.S. dollar equivalent principal amount (<T3>i.e., </T3>U.S. $5,000) at 15 percent per year payable semiannuallyin U.S. dollars. The stated redemption price at maturity is 7,260 Australiandollars. With respect to X, this transaction is a section 988 transactionbecause the principal is payable in nonfunctional currency. Further, theresult would be the same if the principal were payable in U.S. dollarsin an amount determined by multiplying 7,260 Australian dollars by theU.S. dollar spot rate on the maturity date. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (10). </T3>On May 11, 1989, X purchases a one year note atoriginal issue for its issue price of $1,000.

The acquisition of the poundson January 3, 1993, under the spot contract is a section 988 transactionfor purposes of establishing X's basis in the pounds. The disposition ofthe pounds and the acquisition of the bond by X are section 988 transactions.These transactions are not excluded from the definition of a section 988transaction under paragraph (a)(6) of this section because expenses properlyallocable to such transactions meet the requirements of section 212.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2).</T3> X is a U.S. citizen who therefore has the dollaras his functional currency.

(iii) <T3>Example_</T3>(A) X, a corporation with the U.S. dollar as its functionalcurrency, operates through foreign branches Y and Z. Y and Z are qualifiedbusiness units as defined in section 989(a) with the LC as their functionalcurrency. X computes Y's and Z's income under section 987 (relating tobranch transactions). On November 12, 1988, Y transfers $25 to the homeoffice of X when the fair market value of such amount equals LC120. Y hasa basis of LC100 in the $25. Under paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of this section,Y realizes foreign source exchange gain of LC20 (LC120-LC100) as the resultof the $25 transfer. For purposes of determining whether the transfer isa remittance resulting in additional gain or loss, see section 987 andthe regulations thereunder. (B) If instead Y transfers the $25 to Z, exchange gain is not realizedbecause the $25 is nonfunctional currency with respect to Z and if Z wereto immediately convert the $25 into LCs, the gain would be foreign source.For purposes of determining whether the transfer is a remittance resultingin additional gain or loss, see section 987 and the regulations thereunder.(8) <T3>Transactions having the effect of avoiding section 988_</T3>(i) <T3>In general.</T3> The Commissioner may recharacterize a transaction(or series of transactions) in whole or in part as a section 988 transactionif the effect of such transaction (or series of transactions) is to avoidsection 988. In addition, the Commissioner may exclude a transaction (orseries of transactions) which in form is a section 988 transaction fromthe provisions of section 988 if the substance of the transaction (or seriesof transactions) indicates that it is not properly considered a section988 transaction. (ii) <T3>Example.</T3> B is an individual with the U.S. dollar as its functionalcurrency. B holds 500,000 Swiss francs which have a basis of $100,000 anda fair market value of $400,000 as of October 15, 1989. On October 16,1989, B transfers the 500,000 Swiss francs to a newly formed U.S. corporation,X, with the dollar as its functional currency. On October 16, 1989, B sellsthe stock of X for $400,000. Assume the transfer to X qualified for nonrecognitionunder section 351. Because the sale of the stock of X is a substitute forthe disposition of an asset subject to section 988, the Commissioner mayrecharacterize the sale of the stock as a section 988 transaction. Thesame result would obtain if B transferred the Swiss francs to a partnershipand then sold the partnership interest. (b) <T3>Spot contract.</T3> A spot contract is a contract to buy or sell nonfunctionalcurrency on or before two business days following the date of the executionof the contract. See andSection; 1.988-2(d)(ii) for operative rules regardingspot contracts. (c) <T3>Nonfunctional currency.</T3> The term ``nonfunctional currency'' meanswith respect to a taxpayer or a qualified business unit (as defined insection 989(a)) a currency (including the European Currency Unit) otherthan the taxpayer's or the qualified business unit's functional currencyas defined in section 985 and the regulations thereunder. For rules relatingto nonrecognition of exchange gain or loss with respect to certain dispositionsof nonfunctional currency, see andSection; 1.988-2T(a)(1)(iii). (d) <T3>Spot rate_</T3>(1) <T3>In general.</T3> Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, theterm ``spot rate'' means a rate demonstrated to the satisfaction of theDistrict Director to reflect a fair market rate of exchange available tothe public for currency under a spot contract in a free market and involvingrepresentative amounts. In the absence of such a demonstration, the DistrictDirector, in his sole discretion, shall determine the spot rate from asource of exchange rate information reflecting actual transactions conductedin a free market. For example, the taxpayer or the District Director maydetermine the spot rate by reference to exchange rates published in thepertinent monthly issue of ``International Financial Statistics'' or asuccessor publication of the International Monetary Fund; exchange ratespublished by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System pursuantto 31 U.S.C. section 5151; exchange rates published in newspapers, financialjournals or other daily financial news sources; or exchange rates quotedby electronic financial news services. (2) <T3>Consistency required in valuing transactions subject to section 988.</T3>If the use of inconsistent sources of spot rate (or other market rate)quotations results in the distortion of income, the District Director maydetermine the appropriate spot rate (or other market rate). (3) <T3>Use of certain spot rate conventions for payables and receivables denominatedin nonfunctional currency.</T3> If consistent with the taxpayer's financialaccounting, a taxpayer may utilize a spot rate convention determined atintervals of one month or less for purposes of computing exchange gainor loss with respect to payables and receivables denominated in a nonfunctionalcurrency that are incurred in the ordinary course of business with respectto the acquisition or sale of goods or the obtaining or performance ofservices. For example, if consistent with the taxpayer's financial accounting,a taxpayer may accrue all payables and receivables incurred during themonth of January at the spot rate on January 31 (or at an average of anyspot rates occurring during the month) and record the payment or receiptof amounts in satisfaction of such payables and receivables at the spotrate on the last day of the month in which paid or received (or at an averageof any spot rates occurring during the month). The use of a spot rate conventionis a method of accounting under section 446 and cannot be changed withoutthe consent of the Commissioner.(4) <T3>Currency where an official government established rate differs froma free market rate</T3>_(i) <T3>In general.</T3> If a currency has an official government establishedrate that differs from a free market rate, the spot rate shall be the ratewhich most clearly reflects the taxpayer's income. Generally, this shallbe the free market rate. (ii) <T3>Examples.</T3> The following examples illustrate the application ofthis paragraph (d)(4).<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1).</T3> X is an accrual method U.S. corporation with thedollar as its functional currency. X owns all the stock of a Country Lsubsidiary, CFC. CFC has the currency of Country L, the LC, as its functionalcurrency. Country L imposes restrictions on the remittance of dividends.On April 1, 1990, CFC pays a dividend to X in the amount of LC100. Assumethat the official government established rate is $1=LC1 and the free marketrate, which takes into account the remittance restrictions and which isthe rate that most clearly reflects income, is $1=LC4. On April 1, 1990,X donates the LC100 in a transaction that otherwise qualifies as a charitablecontribution under section 170(c). Both the amount of the dividend incomeand the deduction under section 170 is $25 (LC100 andmultiply; the free marketrate, $.25). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2).</T3> X, a corporation with the U.S. dollar as its functionalcurrency, operates in foreign country L through branch Y. Y is a qualifiedbusiness unit as defined in section 989(a). X computes Y's income underthe dollar approximate separate transactions method as described in andSection;1.985-3T. The currency of L is the LC. X can purchase legally United Statesdollars ($) in L only from the L government. In order take advantage ofan arbitrage between the official and secondary dollar to LC exchange ratesin L: (1) X purchases LC100 for $60 in L on the secondary market when theofficial exchange rate is $1=LC1; (2) X transfers the LC100 to Y; (3) Ypurchases $100 for LC100; and (4) Y transfers $65 ($100 less an L tax withheldof $35 on the transfer) to the home office of X. Under paragraph (a)(7)of this section, the transfer of the LC100 by X to Y is a realization event.X has a basis of $60 in the LC100. Under these facts, the appropriate dollarto LC exchange rate for computing the amount realized by X is the officialexchange rate. Therefore, X realizes $40 ($100^$60) of U.S. source gainfrom the transfer to Y. The same result would obtain if Y rather than Xpurchased the LC100 on the secondary market in L with $60 supplied by X,because the substance of this transaction is that X is performing the arbitrage.</ITAG>(e) <T3>Exchange gain or loss.</T3> The term ``exchange gain or loss'' meansthe amount of gain or loss realized as determined in andSection; 1.988-2Twith respect to a section 988 transaction. (f) <T3>Hyperinflationary currency.</T3> For the definition of hyperinflationarycurrency see andSection; 1.985-2T(b)(2) or its successor. Unless otherwiseprovided, the currency in any example used in andSection; 1.988-1T through-5T is not a hyperinflationary currency. (g) <T3>Fair market value.</T3> The fair market value of an item shall, whererelevant, reflect an appropriate premium or discount for the time valueof money (<T3>e.g., </T3>the fair market value of a forward contract to buy or sellnonfunctional currency shall reflect the present value of the differencebetween the units of nonfunctional currency times the market forward rateat the time of valuation and the units of nonfunctional currency timesthe forward rate set forth in the contract). Unless otherwise provided,the fair market value given in any example used in andSection; 1.988-1T through-5T is deemed to reflect appropriately the time value of money. (h) <T3>Interaction with sections 1092 and 1256 in examples.</T3> Unless otherwiseprovided, it is assumed for purposes of andSection;andSection; 1.988-1T through-5T that any contract used in any example is not a section 1256 contractand is not part of a straddle as defined in section 1092. No inferenceis intended regarding the application of section 1092 or 1256 unless expresslystated. (i) <T3>Effective date.</T3> Except as otherwise provided in this section,this section shall be effective for taxable years beginning after December31, 1986. Thus, except as otherwise provided in this section, any paymentsmade or received with respect to a section 988 transaction in taxable yearsbeginning after December 31, 1986, are subject to this section.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1.988-2T</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89"> Recognition and computation of exchange gain or loss (Temporary regulations).</ITAG>(a) <T3>Disposition of nonfunctional currency_</T3>(1) <T3>Recognition of exchange gain or loss_</T3>(i) <T3>In general. </T3>Except as otherwise provided in this section, andSection;1.988-1T(a)(7)(ii), and andSection; 1.988-5T, the recognition of exchangegain or loss upon the sale or other disposition of nonfunctional currencyshall be governed by the recognition provisions of the Internal RevenueCode which apply to the sale or disposition of property (<T3>e.g., </T3>section 1001 or, to the extent provided in regulations,section 1092).

(B) <T3>Example. </T3>X is a corporation on the accrual method of accountingwith the U.S. dollar as its functional currency. On January l, 1989, Xacquires 1,500 British pounds (andCx.13;) for $2,250 (andCx.13;1=$1.50). OnJanuary 3, 1989, when the spot rate is (andCx.13;1=$1.49, X deposits the(andCx.13;1,500 with a British financial institution in a non-interest bearingdemand account. On February 1, 1989, when the spot rate is (andCx.13;1=$1.45,X withdraws the andCx.13;1,500. On February 5, 1989, when the spot rate is(andCx.13;1=$1.42, X purchases inventory in the amount of (andCx.13;1,500.Pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, no exchange loss isrealized until February 5, 1989, when X disposes of the andCx.13;1,500 forinventory. At that time, X realizes exchange loss in the amount of $120computed under paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

(C) <T3>Example</T3>. G is a U.S. corporation with the U.S. dollar as its functionalcurrency. On January 1, 1989, G enters into a contract to purchase a papermanufacturing machine for 10,000,000 British pounds (andCx.13;) for deliveryon January 1, 1991. On January 1, 1991, when G exchanges andCx.13;10,000,000(which G purchased for $12,000,000) for the machine, the fair market valueof the machine is andCx.13;17,000,000. On January 1, 1991, the spot exchangerate is andCx.13;1=$1.50. Under paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(B) of this section,the transaction is treated as an exchange of andCx.13;10,000,000 for $15,000,000and the purchase of the machine for $15,000,000. Accordingly, in computingG's exchange gain of $3,000,000 on the disposition of the andCx.13;10,000,000,the amount realized is $15,000,000. G's basis in the machine is $15,000,000.No gain is recognized on the bargain purchase of the machine. (iii)<T3> Adjusted basis</T3>_(A) <T3>In general. </T3>Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(B) ofthis section, the adjusted basis of nonfunctional currency is determinedunder the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (<T3>e.g., </T3>sections 1011 through 1023). A taxpayer that uses a spotrate convention under andSection; 1.988-1T(d)(3) to determine exchange gainor loss with respect to a receivable shall determine the basis of nonfunctionalcurrency received in satisfaction of such receivable in a manner consistentwith such convention.

(B) <T3>Basis. </T3>If stock or securities traded on an established securitiesmarket are purchased by a cash basis taxpayer for nonfunctional currency,the basis of the stock or securities shall be determined by translatingthe units of nonfunctional currency paid into functional currency at thespot rate on the settlement date of the purchase. (C) <T3>Example. </T3>On November 1, 1989 (the trade date), X, a calendar yearcash basis U.S. individual, purchases stock for andCx.13;100 for settlementon November 5, 1989. On November 1, 1989, the spot value of the andCx.13;100is $140. On November 5, 1989, X purchases andCx.13;100 for $141 which X usesto pay for the stock. X's basis in the stock is $141. On December 30, 1990(the trade date), X sells the stock for andCx.13;110 for settlement on January5, 1991. On December 30, 1990, the spot value of andCx.13;110 is $165. OnJanuary 5, 1991, X transfers the stock and receives andCx.13;110 which, translatedat the spot rate, equal $166. Under section 453(k), the stock is considereddisposed of on December 30, 1990. The amount realized with respect to suchdisposition is the value of the andCx.13;110 on January 5, 1991 ($166). Accordingly,X's gain realized on December 30, 1990, from the disposition of the stockis $25 ($166 amount realized less $141 basis). X's basis in the andCx.13;110received from the sale of the stock is $166.

For example, a taxpayer may translate interest income receivedwith respect to a demand account on the last day of each month of the taxableyear, on the last day of each quarter of the taxable year, on the lastday of each half of the taxable year, or on the last day of the taxableyear. No exchange gain or loss is realized upon the receipt or accrualof interest income with respect to a demand account subject to this paragraph(b)(1).

No exchange gain or loss is realized with respectto the receipt or payment of such interest income or expense (other thanthe exchange gain or loss that might be realized under paragraph (a) ofthis section upon the disposition of the nonfunctional currency so receivedor paid). (C) <T3>Translation of interest income or expense that is required to be accruedprior to receipt or payment. </T3>With respect to an instrument describedin paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, interest income or expense thatis required to be accrued prior to receipt or payment (<T3>e.g., </T3>under section 1272, 1281 or 163(e) or because the taxpayeruses an accrual method of accounting) shall be translated at the averagerate for the interest accrual period or, with respect to an interest accrualperiod that spans two taxable years, at the average rate for the partialperiod within the taxable year. See paragraphs (b) (3) and (4) of thissection for the determination of exchange gain or loss on the receipt orpayment of accrued interest income or expense.(iii) <T3>Determination of average rate. </T3>For purposes of this paragraph(b), the average rate for an accrual period (or partial period) shall bea simple average of the spot exchange rates for each business day of suchperiod or other average exchange rate for the period reasonably derivedand consistently applied by the taxpayer. (3) <T3>Exchange gain or loss recognized by the holder with respect to accruedinterest income. </T3>The holder of a debt instrument described in paragraph(b)(2)(i) of this section shall realize exchange gain or loss with respectto accrued interest income on the date such accrued interest income isreceived or the instrument is disposed of. Except as otherwise providedin this paragraph (b) (<T3>e.g., </T3>paragraph (b)(8) of this section), exchange gain or lossrealized with respect to accrued interest income shall be recognized inaccordance with the applicable recognition provisions of the Internal RevenueCode. The amount of exchange gain or loss so realized with respect to accruedinterest income is determined for each accrual period by_ (i) Translating the units of nonfunctional currency interest income receivedwith respect to such accrual period (as determined under the ordering rulesof paragraph (b)(7) of this section) into functional currency at the spotrate on the date the interest income is received or the instrument is disposedof, and (ii) Subtracting from such amount the amount computed by translating theunits of nonfunctional currency interest income accrued with respect tosuch income received at the average exchange rate for the accrual period.(4) <T3>Exchange gain or loss recognized by the obligor with respect to accruedinterest expense. </T3>The obligor under a debt instrument described inparagraph (b)(2)(i) of this section shall realize exchange gain or losswith respect to accrued interest expense on the date such accrued interestexpense is paid or the obligation to make payments is extinguished or transferred.Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b) (<T3>e.g., </T3>paragraph (b)(8) of this section), exchange gain or lossrealized with respect to accrued interest expense shall be recognized inaccordance with the applicable recognition provisions of the Internal RevenueCode. The amount of exchange gain or loss so realized with respect to accruedinterest expense is determined for each accrual period by_ (i) Translating the units of nonfunctional currency interest expense accruedwith respect to the amount of interest paid into functional currency atthe average exchange rate for such accrual period, and (ii) Subtracting from such amount the amount computed by translating theunits of nonfunctional currency interest paid (or, if the obligation tomake payments is extinguished or transferred, the units accrued) with respectto such accrual period (as determined under the ordering rules in paragraph(b)(7) of this section) into functional currency at the spot rate on thedate payment is made or the obligation is extinguished or transferred.(5) <T3>Exchange gain or loss recognized by the holder of a debt instrumentwith respect to principal. </T3>The holder of a debt instrument describedin paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section shall realize exchange gain or losswith respect to the principal amount of such instrument on the date principal(determined under the ordering rules of paragraph (b)(7) of this section)is received from the obligor or the instrument is disposed of. For purposesof this paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the principal amount of a debtinstrument is the issue price in units of nonfunctional currency if theholder acquired the instrument at original issue, or the adjusted issueprice in units of nonfunctional currency on the date acquired if the holderacquired the instrument after the date of original issue.

Units of nonfunctional currency (oran amount determined with reference to nonfunctional currency) treatedas a receipt or payment of original issue discount under the precedingsentence are attributed to the earliest accrual period in which originalissue discount has accrued and to which prior receipts or payments havenot been attributed. No portion thereof shall be treated as prepaid interest.These rules are illustrated by Example (9) of paragraph (b)(9) of thissection.

However,pursuant to section 988(b) (1) and (2), the sum of any exchange gain orloss with respect to the principal and interest of any such debt instrumentshall be realized only to the extent of the total gain or loss realizedon the transaction. The gain or loss realized shall be recognized in accordancewith the general principles of the Code. See Examples (3), (4) and (6)of paragraph (b)(9) of this section.

X is on the accrual method of accounting. OnJanuary 15, 1989, X sells inventory for 10,000 Canadian dollars (C$). Thespot rate on January 15, 1989, is C$1=U.S.$.55. On February 23, 1989, whenX receives payment of the C$10,000, the spot rate is C$1=U.S.$.50. On February23, 1989, X will realize exchange loss. X's loss is computed by multiplyingthe C$10,000 by the spot rate on the date the C$10,000 are received (C$10,000andmultiply;.50=U.S.$5,000)and subtracting from such amount, the amount computed by multiplying theC$10,000 by the spot rate on the booking date (C$10,000andmultiply;.55=U.S.$5,500).Thus, X's exchange loss on the transaction is U.S.$500 (U.S.$5,000^U.S.$5,500).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2).</T3> The facts are the same as in Example (1) except thatX uses a spot rate convention to determine the spot rate as provided inandSection; 1.988-1T(d)(3). Pursuant to X's spot rate convention, the spotrate at which a payable or receivable is booked is determined monthly foreach nonfunctional currency payable or receivable by adding the spot rateat the beginning of the month and the spot rate at the end of the monthand dividing by two. All payables and receivables in a nonfunctional currencybooked during the month are translated into functional currency at therate described in the preceding sentence. Further, the translation of nonfunctionalcurrency paid with respect to a payable, and nonfunctional currency receivedwith respect to a receivable, is also performed pursuant to the spot rateconvention. Assume the spot rate determined under the spot rate conventionfor the month of January is C$1=U.S.$.54 and for the month of Februaryis C$1=U.S.$.51. On the last date in February, X will realize exchangeloss. X's loss is computed by multiplying the C$10,000 by the spot rateconvention for the month of February (C$10,000andmultiply;U.S.$.51=U.S.$5,100)and subtracting from such amount, the amount computed by multiplying theC$10,000 by the spot rate convention for the month of January (C$10,000andmultiply;U.S.$.54=$5,400).Thus, X's exchange loss on the transaction is U.S.$300 (U.S.$5,100^U.S.$5,400).X's basis in the C$10,000 is U.S.$5,400.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (3).</T3> The facts are the same as in Example (2) except thatX has a standing order with X's bank for the bank to convert any nonfunctionalcurrency received in satisfaction of a receivable into U.S. dollars onthe day received and to deposit those U.S. dollars in X's U.S. dollar bankaccount. X may use its convention to translate the amount booked into U.S.dollars, but must use the U.S. dollar amounts received from the bank withrespect to such receivables to determine X's exchange gain or loss. Thus,if X receives payment of the C$10,000 on February 23, 1989, when the spotrate is C$1=U.S.$.50, X determines exchange gain or loss by subtractingthe amount booked under X's convention (U.S.$5,400) from the amount ofU.S. dollars received from the bank under the standing conversion order(assume $5,000). X's exchange loss is U.S.$400.</ITAG>(d) <T3>Exchange gain or loss with respect to forward contracts, futures contractsand option contracts_</T3>(1) <T3>Scope_</T3>(i) <T3>In general. </T3>This paragraph (d) applies to forward contracts, futurescontracts and option contracts described in andSection; 1.988-1T(a)(1)(ii)and (2)(iii). For rules applicable to currency swaps and notional principalcontracts described in andSection; 1.988-1T(a)(1)(ii) and (2)(iii), see paragraph(e) of this section. (ii) <T3>Treatment of spot contracts. </T3>Solely for purposes of this paragraph(d), a spot contract as defined in andSection; 1.988-1T(b) to buy or sellnonfunctional currency is not considered a forward contract or similartransaction described in andSection; 1.988-1T(a)(2) (iii) unless such spotcontract is disposed of (or otherwise terminated) prior to making or takingdelivery of the currency. For example, if a taxpayer with the dollar asits functional currency enters into a spot contract to purchase Britishpounds, and takes delivery of such pounds under the contract, the deliveryof the pounds is not a realization event under section 988(c)(5) and paragraph(e)(4)(ii) of this section because the contract is not considered a forwardcontract or similar transaction described in andSection; 1.988-1T(a)(2)(iii).However, if the taxpayer sells or otherwise terminates the contract beforetaking delivery of the pounds, exchange gain or loss shall be realizedand recognized in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) and (3) of this section.(2) <T3>Realization of exchange gain or loss_</T3>(i) <T3>In general. </T3>Except as provided in andSection; 1.988-5T, exchangegain or loss on a contract described in andSection; 1.988-2T(d)(1) shallbe realized in accordance with the applicable realization section of theInternal Revenue Code (<T3>e.g., </T3>sections 1001, 1092, and 1256). See also section 988(c)(5).For purposes of determining the timing of the realization of exchange gainor loss, sections 1092 and 1256 shall take precedence over section 988(c)(5).(ii) <T3>Realization by offset_</T3>(A) <T3>In general. </T3>Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) and(C), exchange gain or loss with respect to a transaction described in andSection;1.988-1T(a)(1)(ii) and (2)(iii) shall not be realized solely because suchtransaction is offset by another transaction (or transactions). (B) <T3>Exception where economic benefit is derived. </T3>If a transactiondescribed in andSection; 1.988-1T(a)(1)(ii) and (2)(iii) is offset by anothertransaction or transactions, exchange gain shall be realized to the extentthe taxpayer derives, by pledge or otherwise, an economic benefit (<T3>e.g.,</T3> the proceeds from a borrowing) from any gain inherent insuch offsetting positions. Proper adjustment shall be made in the amountof any gain or loss subsequently realized for gain taken into account byreason of the preceding sentence. This paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) shall applyto transactions creating an offset after September 21, 1989. (C) <T3>Certain contracts traded on an exchange. </T3>If a transaction describedin andSection; 1.988-1T(a)(1)(ii) and (2)(iii) is traded on an exchange andit is the general practice of the exchange to terminate offsetting contracts,entering into an offsetting contract shall be considered a terminationof the contract being offset. (iii) <T3>Clarification of section 988(c)(5). </T3>If the delivery date of acontract subject to section 988(c)(5) and paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of thissection is different than the date the contract expires, then for purposesof determining the date exchange gain or loss is realized, the term deliverydate shall mean expiration date. (iv) <T3>Examples. </T3>The following examples illustrate the rules of thisparagraph (d)(1) and (2).<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1). </T3>On August l, 1989, X, a calendar year corporationwith the dollar as its functional currency, enters into a forward contractwith Bank A to buy 100 New Zealand dollars for $80 for delivery on January31, 1990. (The forward purchase contract is not a section 1256 contract.)On November 1, 1989, the market price for the purchase of 100 New Zealanddollars for delivery on January 31, 1990, is $76. On November 1, 1989,X cancels its obligation under the forward purchase contract and pays BankA $3.95 (the present value of $4 discounted at 12% for the period) in cancellationof such contract. Under section 1001(a), X realizes an exchange loss of$3.95 on November 1, 1989, because cancellation of the forward purchasecontract for cash results in the termination of X's contract. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2). </T3>X is a corporation with the dollar as its functionalcurrency. On January 1, 1989, X enters into a currency swap contract withBank A under which X is obligated to make a series of Japanese yen paymentsin exchange for a series of dollar payments. On February 21, 1992, X hasa gain of $100,000 inherent in such contract as a result of interest rateand exchange rate movements. Also on February 21, 1992, X enters into anoffsetting swap with Bank A to lock in such gain. If on February 21, 1992,X pledges the gain inherent in such offsetting positions as collateralfor a loan, X's initial swap contract is treated as being terminated onFebruary 21, 1992, under paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B). Proper adjustment ismade in the amount of any gain or loss subsequently realized for the gaintaken into account by reason of paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(B) of this section.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (3). </T3>X is a calendar year corporation with the dollaras its functional currency. On October 1, 1989, X enters into a forwardcontract to buy 100,000 Swiss francs (Sf) for delivery on March l, 1990,for $51,220. Assume that the contract is a section 1256 contract undersection 1256(g)(2) and that section 1256(e) does not apply. Pursuant tosection 1256(a)(1), the forward contract is treated as sold for its fairmarket value on December 31, 1989. Assume that the fair market value ofthe contract is $1,000 determined under andSection; 1.988-1T(g). Thus X willrealize an exchange gain of $1,000 on December 31, 1989. Such gain is subjectto the character rules of andSection; 1.988-3T and the source rules of andSection;1.988-4T.</ITAG>(v) <T3>Extension of the maturity date of certain contracts. </T3>An extensionof time for making or taking delivery under a contract described in paragraph(d)(1) of this section (<T3>e.g., </T3>a historical rate rollover as defined in andSection; 1.988-5T(b)(2)(iii)(C))shall be considered a sale or exchange of the contract for its fair marketvalue on the date of the extension and the establishment of a new contracton such date. If, under the terms of the extension, the time value of anygain or loss recognized pursuant to the preceding sentence adjusts theprice of the currency to be bought or sold under the new contract, theamount attributable to such time value shall be treated as interest incomeor expense for all purposes of the Code. (3) <T3>Recognition of exchange gain or loss. </T3>Except as provided in andSection;1.988-5T (relating to section 988 hedging transactions), exchange gainor loss realized with respect to a contract described in paragraph (d)(1)of this section shall be recognized in accordance with the applicable recognitionprovisions of the Internal Revenue Code. For example, a loss realized withrespect to a contract described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section whichis part of a straddle shall be recognized in accordance with the provisionsof section 1092 to the extent such section is applicable. (4) <T3>Determination of exchange gain or loss</T3>_(i) <T3>In general. </T3>Exchange gain or loss with respect to a contract describedin andSection; 1.988-2T(d)(1) shall be determined by subtracting the amountpaid (or deemed paid), if any, for or with respect to the contract (includingany amount paid upon termination of the contract) from the amount received(or deemed received), if any, for or with respect to the contract (includingany amount received upon termination of the contract). Any gain or lossdetermined according to the preceding sentence shall be treated as exchangegain or loss. (ii) <T3>Special rules where taxpayer makes or takes delivery. </T3>If the taxpayermakes or takes delivery in connection with a contract described in paragraph(d)(1) of this section, any gain or loss shall be realized and recognizedin the same manner as if the taxpayer sold the contract (or paid anotherperson to assume the contract) on the date on which he took or made deliveryfor its fair market value on such date. See paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of thissection regarding the definition of the term ``delivery date.'' This paragraph(d)(4)(ii) shall not apply in any case in which the taxpayer makes or takesdelivery before June 11, 1987.

On March 1, 1990, when X takesdelivery of the 100,000 NZD, the spot rate is 1NZD equals $.48. Pursuantto section 988(c)(5) and paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section, a taxpayerthat takes delivery of nonfunctional currency under a forward contractthat is subject to section 988 is treated as if the taxpayer sold the contractfor its fair market value on the date delivery is taken. If X sold thecontract on March 1, 1990, the transferee would require a payment of $1,070[($.48andmultiply;100,000NZD)^($.4907andmultiply;100,000NZD)] to compensatehim for the loss in value of the 100,000NZD.

X pays a $285 premiumto Bank A to obtain the option contract. On September 18, 1989, when Xexercises the option and takes delivery of the C$50,000, the spot rateis C$1 equals U.S. $.90. Pursuant to section 988(c)(5) and paragraph (d)(4)(ii),a taxpayer that takes delivery under an option contract that is subjectto section 988 is treated as if the taxpayer sold the contract for itsfair market value on the date delivery is taken.

Accordingly,X is deemed to have received U.S.$2,500 on the sale of the contract atits fair market value. X will realize U.S. $2,215 ($2,500 deemed receivedless $285 paid) of exchange gain with respect to the delivery of Canadiandollars under the option contract.

(2) <T3>Special rules for currency swaps</T3>_(i) <T3>In general. </T3>Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(B)  ofthis section, the provisions of this paragraph (e)(2) shall apply solelyfor purposes of determining the realization, recognition and amount ofexchange gain or loss with respect to a currency swap contract, and notfor purposes of determining the source of such gain or loss, or characterizingsuch gain or loss as interest. Except as provided in andSection; 1.988-3T(c),any gain or loss realized with respect to a currency swap contract shallbe characterized as exchange gain or loss (and not as interest income orexpense). Any exchange gain or loss realized in accordance with this paragraph(e)(2) shall be recognized unless otherwise provided in an applicable sectionof the Code.

The hypothetical stated redemption price at maturity is the totalof all payments (excluding any exchange of the swap principal amount atthe inception of the contract) provided under the hypothetical borrowingor loan other than periodic interest payments under the principles of section1273. For purposes of determining economic accrual under the currency swap,the number of hypothetical interest compounding periods of such hypotheticalborrowing and loan shall be determined pursuant to a semiannual compoundingconvention unless the currency swap contract indicates otherwise. For purposesof determining the timing and amount of the periodic interim payments,the principles regarding the amortization of interest (see generally, sections1272 through 1275 and 163(e)) shall apply to the hypothetical interestexpense and income of such hypothetical borrowing and loan. However, suchprinciples shall not apply to determine the time when principal is deemedto be paid on the hypothetical borrowing and loan. See paragraph (d)(2)(iii)of this section and Example (2) of paragraph (d)(5) of this section withrespect to the time when principal is deemed to be paid. With respect tothe translation and computation of exchange gain or loss on any hypotheticalinterest income or expense, see andSection; 1.988-2T (b). The amount treatedas exchange gain or loss by the taxpayer with respect to the periodic interimpayments for the taxable year shall be the amount of hypothetical interestincome and exchange gain or loss attributable to such interest income fromthe hypothetical borrowing and loan for such year less the amount of hypotheticalinterest expense and exchange gain or loss attributable to the interestexpense from such hypothetical borrowing and loan for such year.

Such gain or loss shall be determined onthe date of the exchange by subtracting the value (on such date) of theunits of swap principal paid from the value of the units of swap principalreceived. This paragraph (e)(2)(iii) does not apply to an equal exchangeof the swap principal amount at the commencement of the agreement at amarket exchange rate. (iv) <T3>Anti-abuse rule. </T3>If the taxpayer's method of accounting for income,expense, gain or loss attributable to a currency swap does not clearlyreflect income, the Commissioner may apply principles analogous to thoseof section 1274 or such other rules as the Commissioner deems appropriateto determine the hypothetical issue price, the hypothetical stated redemptionprice at maturity, and the amounts required to be taken into account withina taxable year.

Accordingly, C will accrue$17.40 (andCx.13;12andmultiply;$1.45) in 1989 and $16.20 (andCx.13;12andmultiply;$1.35)in 1990. C also will compute hypothetical exchange loss of $.60 on December31, 1989 [(andCx.13;12andmultiply;$1.40)^(andCx.13;12andmultiply;$1.45)] and hypotheticalexchange loss of $.60 on December 31, 1990 [andCx.13;12andmultiply;$1.30)^(andCx.13;12andmultiply;$1.35)]. All such hypothetical interest income andexchange loss are characterized and sourced as exchange gain and loss.Further, C is treated as having paid $15 ($150andmultiply;10%) of hypotheticalinterest on December 31, 1989, and again on December 31, 1990. Such hypotheticalinterest expense is characterized and sourced as exchange loss. Thus, Cwill have a net exchange gain of $1.80 ($17.40^$.60^$15.00) with respectto the periodic interim payments in 1989 and a net exchange gain of $.60($16.20^$.60^$15.00) with respect to the periodic interim payments in 1990.Finally, C will realize an exchange loss on December 31, 1990 with respectto the exchange of the swap principal amount. This loss is determined bysubtracting the value of the units of swap principal paid ($150) from thevalue of the units of swap principal reoeived (andCx.13;100andmultiply;$1.30=$130)resulting in a $20 exchange loss. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (2).</T3> C is an accrual method calendar year corporationwith the dollar as its functional currency.

On January 1, 1989, X enters into a three year currency swapcontract with Y with the following terms. The swap principal amount is$100 and the Swiss franc (Sf) equivalent, Sf200 translated at the swapexchange rate of $1=Sf2. There is no initial exchange of the swap principalamount. The interest rates used to compute the periodic interim paymentsare 10% compounded annually for U.S. dollar payments and 5% compoundedannually for Swiss franc payments. Thus, under the currency swap, X agreesto pay Y $10 (10%andmultiply;$100) on December 31st of 1989, 1990 and 1991and to pay Y the swap principal amount of $100 on December 31, 1991.

Z has the dollar as itsfunctional currency, is on the accrual method of accounting, and has thecalendar year as its taxable year. On January 1, 1990, the exchange rateis $1=Sf2.50.The relevant dollar interest rate is 8% compounded annuallyand the relevant Swiss franc interest rate is 5% compounded annually. Becauseof the movement in exchange and interest rates, the agreement between Xand Z to transfer the currency swap requires X to pay Z $23.56 (the swapdiscount as determined under paragraph (e)(3)). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iv) Pursuant to paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section, X may deductthe loss of $23.56 in 1990. The loss is characterized under andSection; 1.988-3Tand sourced under andSection; 1.988-4T. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(v) Pursuant to paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, Z is requiredto amortize the $23.56 received as follows. The amount of the $23.56 paymentthat is attributable to movements in exchange rates ($20) is taken intoaccount on December 31, 1991, the date the swap principal amounts are exchanged,under paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section. This amount is the presentvalue (discounted at 10%, the rate under the currency swap contract usedto compute the dollar periodic interim payments) of the financial assetrequired to compensate X for the loss in value of the hypothetical Swissfranc loan resulting from movements in exchange rates between January 1,1989 and January 1, 1990. This amount is determined by assuming that interestrates did not change from the date the swap originally was entered into(January 1, 1989), but that the exchange rate is $1=Sf2.50. Under thisassumption, a taxpayer undertaking the obligation to pay dollars underthe currency swap on January 1, 1990, would only agree to pay $8 for Sf10on December 31, 1990 and $88 for Sf210 on December 31, 1991, because theexchange rates have moved from $1=Sf2 to $1=Sf2.50. Thus, Z requires $2on December 31, 1990 and $22 on December 31, 1991 to compensate for theamount of dollar payments Z is required to make in exchange for the Swissfrancs received on December 31, 1990 and 1991. The present value of $2on December 31, 1990 and $22 on December 31, 1991 discounted at the ratefor U.S. dollar payments of 10% is $20 ($1.82+ $18.18). This amount isdiscounted at the rate for U.S. dollar payments (i.e., at the historicrate) because the amount of the $23.56 payment received by Z that is attributableto movements in interest rates is computed and amortized separately asprovided in the following paragraph. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(vi) Pursuant to paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, Z is requiredto amortize the portion of the $23.56 payment attributable to movementsin interest rates under principles of economic accrual over the term ofthe currency swap agreement. The amount of the $23.56 payment that is attributableto movements in interest rates (assuming that exchange rates have not changed)is the present value ($3.56) of the excess ($2.00 in 1990 and $2.00 in1991) of the periodic interim payments Z is required to pay under the currencyswap agreement ($10 in 1990 and $10 in 1991) over the amount Z would berequired to pay if the currency swap agreement reflected current interestrates on the day Z acquired the swap contract ($8 in 1990 and $8 in 1991)discounted at the appropriate dollar interest rate on January 1, 1990.Thus, under principles of economic accrual (e.g., see section 171 of theCode), Z will include in income $1.72 on December 31, 1990, the amountthat, when added to the interest ($.28) on the $3.56 computed at the 8%rate on the date Z acquired the currency swap contract, will equal the$2.00 needed to compensate Z for the movement in interest rates betweenJanuary 1, 1989 and January 1, 1990. Z also will include in income $1.85on December 31, 1991, the amount that, when added to the interest ($.15)on the $1.85 (the remaining balance of the $3.56 payment) computed at the8% rate on the date Z acquired the currency swap contract, will equal the$2.00 needed to compensate Z for the movement in interest rates betweenJanuary 1, 1990 and January 1, 1991. This amount is computed assuming exchangerates have not changed because the amount attributable to movements inexchange rates is computed and amortized separately under the precedingparagraph.</ITAG>(6) <T3>Special effective date for rules regarding currency swaps. </T3>Paragraph(e)(3) of this section regarding amortization of swap premium or discountin the case of off-market currency swaps shall be effective for transactionsentered into after September 21, 1989, unless such swap premium or discountwas paid or received pursuant to a binding contract with an unrelated partythat was entered into prior to such date.

A hedge does not include an option or similarinstrument which does not permit the calculation of a yield to maturity.(ii) <T3>Definition of currency swap contract_</T3>(A) <T3>In general.</T3> A currency swap contract is a contract involving twodifferent currencies between two or more parties to_(<T3>1</T3>) Exchange periodic interim payments, as defined in paragraph(a)(4)(ii)(D) of this section, at the swap exchange rate on or prior tomaturity of the contract; and (<T3>2</T3>) Exchange the swap principal amount upon maturity of the contractat the swap exchange rate.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">A currency swap contract may also require an exchange of the swapprincipal amount upon commencement of the agreement. (B) <T3>Swap principal amount.</T3> The swap principal amount is an amountof two different currencies which, under the terms of the currency swapcontract, is used to determine the periodic interim payments in each currencyand which is exchanged upon maturity of the contract. If such amount isnot clearly set forth in the contract, the Commissioner may determine theswap principal amount. (C) <T3>Swap exchange rate.</T3> The swap exchange rate is the single exchangerate set forth in the contract upon which all exchanges of currency aredetermined. If the swap exchange rate is not clearly set forth in the contract,the Commissioner may determine such rate. (D) <T3>Exchange of periodic interim payments.</T3> An exchange of periodicinterim payments is an exchange of one or more payments in one currencyspecified by the contract for one or more payments in a different currencyspecified by the contract where the payments in each currency are computedby reference to an interest index applied to the swap principal amount.A currency swap contract must clearly indicate the periodic interim payments,or the interest index used to compute the periodic interim payments, ineach currency. (iii) <T3>Anti-abuse rule.</T3> If the currency swap contract does not clearlyset forth the swap principal amount in each currency, the swap exchangerate, or the periodic interim payments in each currency (or the interestindex used to compute the periodic interim payments in each currency),the Commissioner may defer any income, deduction, gain or loss with respectto such contract until termination of the contract. (iv) <T3>Retroactive application of definition of currency swap contract.</T3>A taxpayer may apply this definition of currency swap contract in lieuof the definition of swap agreement in section 2(e)(5) of Notice 87-11,1987-1 C.B. 423 to transactions entered into after December 31, 1986. (5) <T3>Definition of integrated economic transaction.</T3> A qualifying debtinstrument and a hedge are an integrated economic transaction if all ofthe following requirements are satisfied_(i) All nonfunctional currency payments to be made or received under thequalifying debt instrument (or amounts determined by reference to a nonfunctionalcurrency) are fully hedged on the date the taxpayer identifies the transactionunder paragraph (a) of this section as a qualified hedging transactionsuch that the cost or return with respect to the qualifying debt instrumentis not affected by movements in exchange rates in the currency in whichsuch instrument is denominated after the identification date. (ii) The hedge is entered into on the date the transaction is identifiedas a qualified hedging transaction. (iii) None of the parties to the hedge are related. The term ``related''means the relationships defined in section 267(b) or section 707(c)(1).(iv) The identification requirements of paragraph (a)(8) of this sectionare satisfied. (v) In the case of a qualified business unit with a residence, as definedin section 988(a)(3)(B) of the Code, outside of the United States, boththe qualifying debt instrument and the hedge are properly reflected onthe books of such qualified business unit throughout the term of the qualifiedhedging transaction. (vi) Subject to the limitations of paragraph (a)(5) of this section, boththe qualifying debt instrument and the hedge are entered into by the sameindividual, partnership, trust, estate, or corporation. With respect toa corporation, the same corporation must enter into both the qualifyingdebt instrument and the hedge whether or not such corporation is a memberof an affiliated group of corporations that files a consolidated return.(vii) With respect to a foreign person engaged in a U.S. trade or businessthat enters into a qualifying debt instrument or hedge through such tradeor business, all items of income and expense associated with the qualifyingdebt instrument and the hedge (other than interest expense that is subjectto andSection; 1.882-5), would have been effectively connected with suchU.S. trade or business throughout the term of the qualified hedging transactionhad this paragraph (a) not applied. (6) <T3>Special rules for legging in and legging out of integrated treatment_</T3>(i)<T3>Legging in.</T3> If a hedge is entered into after the date the qualifyingdebt instrument is entered into or acquired, and the other requirementsof this paragraph (a) are satisfied, then this paragraph (a) shall apply,and_(A) The qualifying debt instrument shall be treated as sold for its fairmarket value on the identification date, and any gain or loss (includinggain or loss resulting from factors other than movements in exchange rates)from the issue or acquisition date to the identification date is realizedon the identification date, and (B) Such gain or loss will be recognized on the date that the qualifyingdebt instrument matures or is otherwise disposed of. (ii) <T3>Legging out.</T3> If a qualifying debt instrument and hedge are properlyidentified as a qualified hedging transaction and the taxpayer disposesof or otherwise terminates the qualifying debt instrument or hedge priorto maturity of the qualified hedging transaction, the following rules shallapply. (A) The transaction will be treated as a qualified hedging transactionduring the time the requirements of this paragraph (a) were satisfied.(B) If the hedge is disposed of or otherwise terminated, the qualifyingdebt instrument shall be treated as sold for its fair market value on thedate the hedge is disposed of or otherwise terminated (the ``leg-out date''),and any gain or loss (including gain or loss resulting from factors otherthan movements in exchange rates) from the identification date to the leg-outdate is realized and recognized on the leg-out date. The spot rate on theleg-out date shall be used to determine exchange gain or loss on the debtinstrument for the period beginning on the leg-out date and ending on thedate such instrument matures or is disposed of or otherwise terminated.Proper adjustment to the principal amount of the debt instrument must bemade to reflect any gain or loss taken into account. The netting rule ofandSection; 1.988-2T(b)(8) shall apply.(C) If the qualifying debt instrument is disposed of or otherwise terminated,the hedge shall be treated as sold for its fair market value on the datethe qualifying debt instrument is disposed of or otherwise terminated (the``leg-out date''), and any gain or loss from the identification date tothe leg-out date is realized and recognized on the leg-out date. The spotrate on the leg-out date shall be used to determine exchange gain or losson the hedge for the period beginning on the leg-out date and ending onthe date such hedge is disposed of or otherwise terminated. (7) <T3>Transactions part of a straddle. </T3>At the discretion of the Commissioner,a transaction shall not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (a)(5) ofthis section if the debt instrument making up the qualified hedging transactionis part of a straddle as defined in section 1092(c) prior to the time thequalified hedging transaction is identified. (8) <T3>Identification requirements_</T3>(i) <T3>Identification by the taxpayer. </T3>A taxpayer must establish a separateaccount into which it must enter for each qualified hedging transactionthe following information_(A) The date the qualifying debt instrument and hedge were entered into;(B) The date the qualifying debt instrument and the hedge are identifiedas constituting a qualified hedging transaction; (C) The amount, if any, that must be deferred under paragraph (a)(6)(i)of this section; (D) A description of the qualifying debt instrument and the hedge; and(E) A summary of the cash flow resulting from treating the qualifying debtinstrument and the hedge as a qualified hedging transaction. (ii) <T3>Identification by the Commissioner. </T3>If_(A) A person enters into a qualifying debt instrument and a hedge but failsto comply with one or more of the requirements of this paragraph (a), and(B) On the basis of all the facts and circumstances, the Commissioner concludesthat the qualifying debt instrument and the hedge are, in substance, aqualified hedging transaction,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">then the Commissioner may treat the qualifying debt instrument andthe hedge as a qualified hedging transaction. The Commissioner may identifya qualifying debt instrument and a hedge as a qualified hedging transactionregardless of whether the qualifying debt instrument and the hedge areheld by the same taxpayer. (9) <T3>Taxation of qualified hedging transactions_</T3>(i) <T3>In general_</T3>(A) <T3>General rule. </T3>If a transaction constitutes a andSection; 1.988-5T(a)qualified hedging transaction as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section,the qualifying debt instrument and the hedge are integrated and treatedas a single transaction with respect to the taxpayer that has entered intothe qualified hedging transaction during the period that the transactionqualifies as a qualified hedging transaction. Neither the qualifying debtinstrument nor the hedge that make up the qualified hedging transactionshall be subject to sections 263(g), 1092 or 1256 for the period such transactionsare integrated. However, the qualified hedging transaction may be subjectto sections 263(g) or 1092 if such transaction is part of a straddle. (B) <T3>Special rule for income or expense of foreign persons effectively connectedwith a U.S. trade or business. </T3>Interest income of a foreign personresulting from a qualified hedging transaction entered into by such foreignperson that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (a)(5)(vii) of thissection shall be treated as effectively connected with a U.S. trade orbusiness. Interest expense of a foreign person resulting from a qualifiedhedging transaction entered into by such foreign person that satisfiesthe requirements of paragraph (a)(5)(vii) of this section shall be allocatedand apportioned under andSection; 1.882-5 of the regulations. (C) <T3>Special rule for foreign persons that enter into qualified hedgingtransactions giving rise to U.S. source income not effectively connectedwith a U.S. trade or business. </T3>If a foreign person enters into a qualifiedhedging transaction that gives rise to U.S. source interest income (determinedunder the source rules for synthetic asset transactions as provided inthis section) not effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business ofsuch foreign person, for purposes of sections 871(a), 881, 1441, 1442 and6049, the provisions of this paragraph (a) shall not apply and such sectionsof the Internal Revenue Code shall be applied separately to the qualifyingdebt instrument and the hedge. To the extent relevant to any foreign person,if the requirements of this paragraph (a) are otherwise met, the provisionsof this paragraph (a) shall apply for all other purposes of the InternalRevenue Code (<T3>e.g., </T3>for purposes of calculating the earnings and profits ofa controlled foreign corporation that enters into a qualified hedging transactionthrough a qualified business unit resident outside the United States, incomeor expense with respect to such qualified hedging transaction shall becalculated under the provisions of this paragraph (a)). (ii) <T3>Income tax effects of integration. </T3>The income tax effects of integratingand treating a transaction as a single transaction are to create a syntheticdebt instrument that is subject to the original issue discount provisionsof sections 1272 through 1288 and 163(e), the terms of which are determinedas follows: (A) <T3>Denomination of synthetic debt instrument. </T3>In the case where thequalifying debt instrument is a borrowing, the denomination of the syntheticdebt instrument is the same as the currency paid under the terms of thehedge to acquire the currency used to make payments under the qualifyingdebt instrument. In the case where the qualifying debt instrument is alending, the denomination of the synthetic debt instrument is the sameas the currency received under the terms of the hedge in exchange for amountsreceived under the qualifying debt instrument. For example, if the hedgeis a forward contract to acquire British pounds for dollars, and the qualifyingdebt instrument is a borrowing denominated in British pounds, the syntheticdebt instrument is considered a borrowing in dollars. (B) <T3>Term and accrual periods. </T3>The term of the synthetic debt instrumentshall be the period beqinning on the identification date and ending onthe date the qualifying debt instrument matures or such earlier date thatthe qualifying debt instrument or hedge is disposed of or otherwise terminated.Unless otherwise clearly indicated by the payment interval under the hedge,the accrual period shall be a six month period which ends on the datesdetermined under section 1272(a)(5). (C) <T3>Issue price. </T3>The issue price of the synthetic debt instrumentis the adjusted issue price of the qualifying debt instrument translatedinto the currency in which the synthetic debt instrument is denominatedat the spot rate on the identification date.(D) <T3>Stated redemption price at maturity.</T3> In the case where the qualifyingdebt instrument is a borrowing, the stated redemption price at maturityshall be determined under section 1273(a)(2) on the identification dateby reference to the amounts to be paid under the hedge to acquire the currencynecessary to make interest and principal payments on the qualifying debtinstrument. In the case where the qualifying debt instrument is a lending,the stated redemption price at maturity shall be determined under section1273(a)(2) on the identification date by reference to the amounts to bereceived under the hedge in exchange for the interest and principal paymentsreceived pursuant to the terms of the qualifying debt instrument. (iii) <T3>Source of interest income and allocation of expense.</T3> Interestincome from a synthetic debt instrument described in paragraph (a)(9)(ii)of this section shall be sourced by reference to the source of income undersections 861(a)(1) and 862(a)(1) of the qualifying debt instrument. Thecharacter for purposes of section 904 of interest income from a syntheticdebt instrument shall be determined by reference to the character of thequalifying debt instrument. Interest expense from a synthetic debt instrumentdescribed in paragraph (a)(9)(ii) of this section shall be allocated andapportioned under andSection; 1.861-8T to -12T or the successor sectionsthereof or under andSection; 1.882-5.

On January 1, 1991, K disposes of the forwardcontracts that were to mature on December 31, 1991, and December 31, 1992and incurs a loss of $3.62 (the present value of $.10 with respect to the1991 contract and $4.27 with respect to the 1992 contract). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(i) The purchase of the franc debt instrument (which constitutes aqualifying debt instrument under paragraph (a)(3) of this section) andthe series of forward contracts (which constitute a hedge under paragraph(a)(4) of this section) are a qualified hedging transaction under paragraph(a)(1) of this section.

Additionally, K is deemed to have soldthe franc debt instrument for $102.86, its fair market value in dollarson January 1, 1991.

(b) <T3>Hedged executory contracts</T3>_(1) <T3>In general.</T3> If the taxpayer enters into a hedged executory contractas defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the executory contractand the hedge shall be integrated as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of thissection. (2) <T3>Definitions</T3>_(i) <T3>Hedged executory contract.</T3> A hedged executory contract is an executorycontract as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section that is thesubject of a hedge as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section,provided that the following requirements are satisfied_(A) The executory contract and the hedge are identified as a hedged executorycontract as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. (B) The hedge is entered into (or in the case of nonfunctional currencydeposited in a separate account with a bank or other financial institution,such currency is acquired and deposited) on or after the date the executorycontract is entered into and before the accrual date as defined in paragraph(b)(2)(iv) of this section. (C) The executory contract is hedged in whole or in part throughout theperiod beginning with the date the hedge is identified in accordance withparagraph (b)(3) of this section and ending on or after the accrual date(but not later than the payment date), and the amount of the executorycontract that is hedged is not decreased during such period (although theamount may be increased). (D) None of the parties to the hedge are related. The term related meansthe relationships defined in section 267(b) and section 707(c)(1). (E) In the case of a qualified business unit with a residence, as definedin section 988(a)(3)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code, outside of the UnitedStates, both the executory contract and the hedge are properly reflectedon the books of the same qualified business unit.(F) Subject to the limitations of paragraph (b)(2)(i)(E) of this section,both the executory contract and the hedge are entered into by the sameindividual, partnership, trust, estate, or corporation. With respect toa corporation, the same corporation must enter into both the executorycontract and the hedge whether or not such corporation is a member of anaffiliated group of corporations that files a consolidated return. (G) With respect to a foreign person engaged in a U.S. trade or businessthat enters into an executory contract or hedge through such trade or business,all items of income and expense associated with the executory contractand the hedge would have been effectively connected with such U.S. tradeor business throughout the term of the hedged executory contract had thisparagraph (b) not applied. (ii) <T3>Executory contract_</T3>(A) <T3>In general. </T3>Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of thissection, an executory contract is an agreement entered into before theaccrual date to pay nonfunctional currency (or an amount determined withreference thereto) in the future with respect to the purchase of propertyused in the ordinary course of the taxpayer's business, or the acquisitionof a service (or services), in the future, or to receive nonfunctionalcurrency (or an amount determined with reference thereto) in the futurewith respect to the sale of property used or held for sale in the ordinarycourse of the taxpayer's business, or the performance of a service (orservices), in the future. (Thus, for example, a contract to sell stockof an affiliate is not an executory contract for this purpose.) On theaccrual date, such agreement ceases to be considered an executory contractand is treated as an account payable or receivable. (B) <T3>Exceptions. </T3>An executory contract does not include a section 988transaction. For example, a forward contract to purchase nonfunctionalcurrency is not an executory contract. An executory contract also doesnot include a transaction described in paragraph (c) of this section. (iii) <T3>Hedge_</T3>(A) <T3>In general. </T3>For purposes of this paragraph (b), the term hedgemeans a deposit of nonfunctional currency in a separate acccount (for eachhedge) with a bank or other financial institution, a forward or futurescontract described in andSection; 1.988-1T(a) (1)(ii) and (2)(iii), or combinationthereof, which reduces the risk of exchange rate fluctuations by referenceto the taxpayer's functional currency with respect to nonfunctional currencypayments made or received under an executory contract. (B) <T3>Special rule for series of hedges. </T3>Except as provided in paragraph(b)(4)(iii)(B) of this section, a series of hedges as defined in paragraph(b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section shall be considered a hedge if the executorycontract is hedged in whole or in part throughout the period beginningwith the date the hedge is identified in accordance with paragraph (b)(3)(i)of this section and ending on or after the accrual date. A taxpayer thatenters into a series of hedges will be deemed to have satisfied the precedingsentence if the hedge that succeeds a hedge that has been terminated isentered into on the business day following such termination. (C) <T3>Special rules for historical rate rollovers</T3>_(<T3>1</T3>) <T3>Definition. </T3>A historical rate rollover is an extension of thematurity date of a forward contract where the new forward rate is adjustedon the rollover date to reflect the taxpayer's gain or loss on the contractas of the rollover date plus the time value of such gain or loss throughthe new maturity date. (<T3>2</T3>)<T3> Certain historical rate rollovers considered a hedge. </T3>A historicalrate rollover is considered a hedge if the rollover date is before theaccrual date. (<T3>3</T3>)<T3> Treatment of time value component of certain historical rate rolloversthat are hedges. </T3>Interest income or expense determined under andSection;1.988-2T(d)(2)(v) with respect to a historical rate rollover shall be consideredpart of a hedge if the period beginning on the first date a hedging contractis rolled over and ending on the date payment is made or received underthe executory contract does not exceed 183 days. Such interest income orexpense shall not be recognized and shall be an adjustment to the incomefrom, or expense of, the services performed or received under the executorycontract, or to the amount realized or basis of the property sold or purchasedunder the executory contract. For the treatment of such interest incomeor expense that is not considered part of a hedge see andSection; 1.988-2T(d)(2)(v).(D) <T3>Interest on deposit of nonfunctional currency. </T3>Interest incomeon a deposit of nonfunctional currency in a separate account for each hedgewith a bank or other financial institution may be taken into account forpurposes of determining the amount of a hedge if such interest is accruedon or before the accrual date. However, such interest income shall be includedin income as provided in section 61. For example if a taxpayer with thedollar as its functional currency enters into an executory contract forthe purchase and delivery of a machine in one year for 100 British pounds(andCx.13;), and on such date deposits andCx.13;90.91 in a properly identifiedbank account that bears interest at the rate of 10%, the interest thataccrues prior to the accrual date shall be included in income and may beconsidered a hedge. (iv) <T3>Accrual date. </T3>The accrual date is the date when the item of incomeor expense (including a capital expenditure) that relates to an executorycontract is required to be accrued under the taxpayer's method of accounting.(v) <T3>Payment date. </T3>The payment date is the date when payment is madeor received with respect to an executory contract or the subsequent correspondingaccount payable or receivable. (3) <T3>Identification rules_</T3>(i) <T3>Identification by the taxpayer.</T3> A taxpayer must establish a separateaccount on its books and records designated ``Executory Contract HedgingAccount under andSection; 1.988-5T(b).'' Before the close of the date thehedge is entered into, the taxpayer must enter into the account a cleardescription of the executory contract and the hedge and indicate that thetransaction is being identified in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) ofthis section. (ii) <T3>Identification by the Commissioner.</T3> If a taxpayer enters intoan executory contract and a hedge but fails to satisfy one or more of therequirements of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section and, based on the factsand circumstances, the Commissioner concludes that the executory contractis hedged, then the Commissioner may apply the provisions of paragraph(b)(3)(i) of this section as if the taxpayer had satisfied all of the requirementstherein, and may make appropriate adjustments. The Commissioner may applythe provisions of paragraph (b) of this section regardless of whether theexecutory contract and the hedge are held by the same taxpayer. (4) <T3>Effect of hedged executory contract_</T3>(i) <T3>In general.</T3> The effect of integrating an executory contract anda hedge is to treat amounts paid or received under the hedge as paid orreceived under the executory contract, or any subsequent account payableor receivable, or that portion thereof to which the hedge relates. No exchangegain or loss shall be recognized on the hedge. If an executory contract,on the accrual date, becomes an account payable or receivable, no exchangegain or loss shall be recognized on such payable or receivable for theperiod covered by the hedge. (ii) <T3>Partially hedged executory contracts.</T3> The effect of integratingan executory contract and a hedge that partially hedges such contract isto treat the amounts paid or received in functional currency under thehedge as paid or received under the portion of the executory contract beinghedged, or any subsequent account payable or receivable. The income orexpense of services performed or received under the executory contract,or the amount realized or basis of property sold or purchased under theexecutory contract, that is attributable to that portion of the executorycontract that is not hedged shall be translated into functional currencyon the accrual date. Exchange gain or loss shall be realized when paymentis made or received with respect to any payable or receivable arising onthe accrual date with respect to such unhedged amount. (iii) <T3>Disposition of a hedge or executory contract prior to the accrual date_</T3>(A)<T3>In general.</T3> If a taxpayer identifies an executory contract aspart of a hedged executory contract as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of thissection, and disposes of (or otherwise terminates) the executory contractprior to the accrual date, the hedge shall be treated as sold for its fairmarket value on the date the executory contract is disposed of and anygain or loss shall be realized and recognized on such date. The spot rateon the date the hedge is treated as sold shall be used to determine subsequentexchange gain or loss on the hedge. If a taxpayer identifies a hedge aspart of a hedged executory contract as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of thissection, and disposes of the hedge prior to the accrual date, any gainor loss realized on such disposition shall not be recognized and shallbe an adjustment to the income from, or expense of, the services performedor received under the executory contract, or to the amount realized orbasis of the property sold or purchased under the executory contract.(B) <T3>Certain events in a series of hedges treated as a termination of thehedged executory contract. </T3>If the amount of the hedge is decreasedduring the period between the identification date and the accrual date,or if the rules of paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(B) are not satisfied, the hedgedexecutory contract shall be terminated and the provisions of paragraph(b)(4)(iii)(A) shall apply to any gain or loss actually realized with respectto such hedge. Any subsequent hedging contracts entered into to reducethe risk of exchange rate movements with respect to such executory contractshall not be considered a hedge as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) ofthis section. (iv) <T3>Disposition of a hedge on or after the accrual date. </T3>If a taxpayeridentifies a hedge as part of a hedged executory contract as defined inparagraph (b)(2) of this section, and disposes of the hedge on or afterthe accrual date, no gain or loss is recognized on the hedge and the bookingdate as defined in andSection; 1.988-2T(c)(2) of the payable or receivablefor purposes of computing exchange gain or loss shall be the date suchhedge is disposed of. See Example (3) of paragraph (b)(4)(iv) of this section.(v) <T3>Sections 263(g), 1092, and 1256 do not apply. </T3>Sections 263(g),1092, and 1256 do not apply with respect to an executory contract or hedgewhich comprise a hedged executory contract as defined in paragraph (b)(2)of this section. However, sections 263(g), 1092 and 1256 may apply to thehedged executory contract if such transaction is part of a straddle. (vi) <T3>Examples. </T3>The principles set forth in paragraph (b) of this sectionare illustrated in the following examples. The examples assume that K isan accrual method, calendar year U.S. corporation with the dollar as itsfunctional currency.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Example (1)</T3>_(i) On January 1, 1992, K enters into a contract withJPF, a Swiss machine manufacturer, to pay 500,000 Swiss francs for deliveryof a machine on June 1, 1993. Also on January 1, 1992, K enters into aforeign currency forward agreement to purchase 500,000 Swiss francs for$250,000 for delivery on June 1, 1993. K properly identifies the executorycontract and the hedge in accordance with paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section.On June 1, 1993, K takes delivery of the 500,000 Swiss francs (in exchangefor $250,000) under the forward contract and makes payment of 500,000 Swissfrancs to JPF in exchange for the machine.

OnSeptember 1, 1993, K takes delivery of the 500,000 Swiss francs (in exchangefor $250,000) under the forward contract and makes payment of 500,000 Swissfrancs to S. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the hedge is integratedwith the executory contract.

In addition,no exchange gain or loss is recognized on the payable in existence fromJune 1, 1993, to September 1, 1993.

K's basis in the machine is $250,000 (the amount fixed by the forwardcontract), regardless of the amount in dollars that K actuallly pays toacquire the Sf500,000 when K pays for the machine. K has a payable witha booking date of August 1, 1993, payable on September 1, 1993 for 500,000Swiss francs.

K's basis in the machine therefore is $250,000.K recognizes no exchange gain or loss on the foreign currency forward contractbut K will realize exchange gain of $500 on the disposition of the Sf250,000purchased on August 30, 1993 under andSection; 1.988-2T (a). In addition,exchange loss is realized on the unhedged portion of the payable in existencefrom June 1, 1993, to September 1, 1993.

Assuming that the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(i) are satisfied,the executory contract to buy steel and the forward agreements are integratedunder paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Because the period from the rolloverdate to the date payment is made under the executory contract does notexceed 183 days, the $890 of interest income is considered part of thehedge and is not recognized. Thus, K is deemed to have paid $524,210 forthe steel and will have a basis in the steel of $524,210. No gain is realizedwith respect to the forward contracts and section 1256 does not apply tosuch contracts.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(v) Assume instead that on January 1, 1990, K purchases Sf952,380.95(the present value of Sf1,000,000 to be paid on December 31, 1990) for$476,190.48 and on the same day deposits the Swiss francs in a separatebank account that bears interest at a rate of 5%, compounded annually.K properly identifies the transaction as a hedged executory contract. Overthe period beginning January 1, 1990, and ending December 31, 1990, K receivesSf47,619.05 in interest on the account that is included in income and thathas a basis of $25,714.29. (Assume that under andSection; 1.988-2T(b)(1),K uses the spot rate of Sf1=$.54 to translate the interest income). OnDecember 31, 1990, K makes payment of the Sf1,000,000 principal and accruedinterest in the account to S. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of thissection, the principal in the bank acccount and the interest constitutea hedge. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the hedge is integratedwith the executory contract. Therefore K is deemed to have paid $501,904.77(the basis of the principal deposited plus the basis of the interest) forthe steel and there is no exchange gain or loss on the disposition of theSf1,000,000. K's basis in the steel therefore is $501,904.77.</ITAG>(c) <T3>Hedges of period between trade date and settlement date on purchaseor sale of publicly traded stock or security in the case of cash basistaxpayers.</T3> If a cash basis taxpayer purchases or sells stocks or securitieswhich are traded on an established securities market and_(1) Hedges all or part of such purchase or sale for the period beginningon the trade date and ending on the settlement date, and(2) Identifies the hedge and the underlying stock or securities as an integratedtransaction under the rules of paragraph (b)(3) of this section,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">then any gain or loss on the hedge shall be an adjustment to the amountrealized or the adjusted basis of the stock or securities sold or purchased(and shall not be taken into account as exchange gain or loss).
