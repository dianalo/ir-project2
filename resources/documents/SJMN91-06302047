If the would-be buyer ofa stock is not matched with a would-be seller, the buyer pays nothing. Ifthere is a match, the buyer pays an average of less than a penny a share --compared with at least six to seven cents a share on the New York StockExchange for institutional investors and substantially more for individualinvestors.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Business Monday  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  FIRM INVENTS INNOVATIVE WAY TO SWAP STOCK  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  See also related stories on page 1D andamp; 9D in this section  </MEMO><TEXT>     The only catch is that investors must confine trading to a specific time ofday. But &quot;if there is no new information out on a stock, why not wait and savea lot of money?&quot; asked David Jeffrey, a Wunsch vice president.;   WunschAuction Systems, which started operating six months ago, is the United States'smallest electronic stock trading network. It has only 48 participatinginstitutional investors and investment firms. In its best month, July, anaverage of only 141,672 shares changed hands daily.;   Still, this system isattracting a lot of attention. Unlike similar competing systems, such as theInstinet Crossing Network, prices are not tagged to the New York StockExchange or any place else. Prospective buyers and sellers, whose creditstanding is cleared through a unit of Bankers Trust New York Corp., simplysubmit whatever prices they want.;   The Wunsch system also appears to be theonly one with an &quot;open book,&quot; which means any participant in an auction canaccess a listing of buy and sell orders entered by other participants and thenwatch prices change in sync with the rate in which buy and sell orders areentered. Participants believe this eliminates an advantage of a New York StockExchange &quot;specialist,&quot; who shepherds orders through the Big Board and is theonly one who knows the relative strength of buy and sell orders in specificstocks.;   The mechanics of the Wunsch auction are simple. Orders pile up atvarious prices. Then, at 9 a.m. and at 5 p.m., buy and sell orders are matchedat prices that meet each side's parameters.;   Jeffrey and founder StevenWunsch said their system is best for trading stocks because it eliminatesmiddlemen -- specialists on the New York and American Stock exchanges and&quot;market makers&quot; on the NASDAQ system -- and thus fetches better prices forstock traders. They said stock prices change mostly because buyers and sellersarrive randomly throughout the day, guaranteeing chronic price swings.;  &quot;Only intermediaries can quickly fill buy and sell orders that are alwaysflowing in haphazardly,&quot; Jeffrey said. &quot;Ultimately, that means money in theirpockets and less money in the pockets of investors.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Steve Kaufman  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911028  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  9D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  492  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday, October 28, 199100302047,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
