Revisionsto the proposed standards were proposed in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on November 8, 1985 (50 FR 46464). This actionpromulgates these standards of performance for FCCU regenerators. Thesestandards implement section 111 of the Clean Air Act and are based on theAdministrator's determination that emissions from petroleum refineriescause, or contribute significantly to, air pollution which may reasonablybe anticipated to endanger public health or welfare. The intended effectof these standards is to require all new, modified, and reconstructed FCCUregenerators to achieve emission levels that reflect the best demonstratedsystem of continuous emission reduction considering costs, non-air qualityhealth, and environmental and energy impacts. The standards define an FCCUto include fluidized bed treatment processes requiring the continuous regenerationof catalyst or contact materials by burning off coke and other deposits.New, modified, and reconstructed process units fitting this definitionwould be required to achieve the FCCU carbon monoxide (CO), particulate,and opacity standards in 40 CFR part 60, subpart J, as well as the SO<T2>X</T2> standards promulgated today.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>This regulation is effective August 17, 1989.These standards of performance become effective upon publication but applyto affected facilities for which construction, modification, or reconstructioncommenced after January 17, 1984. Any FCCU that was constructed, modified,or reconstructed on or before January 17, 1984 to use a contact materialfor removing impurities from feedstock (rather than a catalyst for crackingfeedstock) is not retroactively subject to the FCCU standards for particulate,opacity, and CO emissions.

The Standards </ITAG>Standards of performance for new sources established under section 111of the Clean Air Act reflect:<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * application of the best technological system of continuous emissionreduction which (taking into consideration the cost of achieving such emissionreduction, any non-air quality health and environmental impact and energyrequirements) the Administrator determines has been adequately demonstrated[section 111(a)(1)].</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">For convenience, this will be referred to as ``best demonstrated technology''or ``BDT.'' As prescribed by section 111, promulgation of these standards was precededby the Administrator's determination (40 CFR 60.16, 38 FR 15380 dated June11, 1973) that petroleum refineries contribute significantly to air pollutionwhich may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.The promulgated standards limit SO<T2>X</T2> emissions from new, modified, and reconstructed affected facilities.For the purpose of these standards, the affected facility is identifiedas the FCCU regenerator (or regenerators where an FCCU has multiple regenerators)and air blower. The definition of FCCU in the standards includes unitsthat can process residual feedstocks. These units are commonly referredto as heavy oil cracking (HOC) units and include reduced crude conversion(RCC) units. The definition also includes other process units such as asphaltresidual treatment (ART) units that are similar to an FCCU in equipmentconfiguration, operation, and emissions. An ART unit circulates and regeneratesa contact material for removing feedstock impurities, including sulfur.Such units constructed, modified, or reconstructed after January 17, 1984,are subject to these standards and to the FCCU standards in 40 CFR part60 subpart J for particulate matter, CO, and visible emissions. A refiner can choose from several alternatives to achieve the standards.Each of these alternatives is discussed below. The standard for FCCU's with add-on controls is applicable if a refinerchooses to use an add-on control device, such as a scrubber. This standardrequires that sulfur dioxide (SO<T2>2</T2>) emissions from the FCCU regenerator must be reduced by at least90 percent, or that the SO<T2>2</T2> emissions to the atmosphere must be no greater than 50 partsper million by volume (vppm) whichever is less stringent. The standardfor FCCU's with add-on controls now requires determination of complianceon a daily basis, rather than using excess emissions to identify the needfor a compliance test. Use of continuous SO<T2>2</T2> monitors, located at the control device inlet and outlet, isrequired to determine on a continual basis the compliance status of thefacility. Only a continuous monitor at the outlet of the control deviceis required if the owner or operator seeks to comply specifically withonly the 50 vppm standard. Because SO<T2>2</T2> monitors are now used for compliance determinations, they aresubject to 40 CFR part 60 appendix F, ``Quality Assurance Procedures, Procedure1_Quality Assurance Requirements for Gas Continuous Emission MonitoringSystems Used for Compliance Determinations.'' The compliance averagingtime has changed since proposal from 3 hours to a rolling 7-day average.Minimum data requirements have now been incorporated. The minimum datarequirements require 22 valid days of data out of every 30 successive,rolling calendar days. A valid day of data consists of a minimum of 18valid hours of data, where a valid hour of data consists of at least 2valid data points. If the continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS)does not collect enough data to meet the minimum data requirement, thenother means, such as manual test Methods 6B or 8, or another CEMS mustbe used to obtain sufficient data to meet the minimum data requirements.The standard for FCCU's without add-on controls requires that a refinerlimit SO<T2>X</T2> emissions to the atmosphere from an FCCU to a level less thanor equal to 9.8 kilograms (kg)/1,000 kg coke burn-off without the use ofan add-on control device. Examples of SO<T2>X</T2> control techniques that could be used to achieve this standardinclude SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalysts and feed hydrotreating. Like the standardfor FCCU's with add-on controls, the standard for FCCU's without add-oncontrols now requires daily compliance determinations. Compliance withthe standard is determined by manual stack sampling using EPA ReferenceMethod 1 for sample and velocity traverses, Method 2 calculation proceduresfor velocity and volumetric flowrate, Method 3 for gas analysis, and Method8 for determining the SO<T2>X</T2> content of the stack gases. The compliance averaging time hasalso changed since proposal from 3 hours to 7 days, so that daily compliancedeterminations are made on the basis of a 7-day rolling average. One 3-hourMethod 8 test is required each day. Alternative methods may be approvedon a case-by-case basis if sufficient data are obtained to show that thedata can be used for making compliance determinations on a daily basis.The feed sulfur cutoff states that FCCU's processing feedstocks with sulfurcontents less than or equal to 0.30 percent by weight, averaged over arolling 7-day period, are exempt from both the standard for FCCU's withadd-on controls and the standard for FCCU's without add-on controls. Refinerscan use low sulfur feedstocks or hydrotreating to meet this limit. Compliancewith the feed sulfur cutoff is determined by sampling the fresh feedstockto the FCCU and determining its sulfur content using American Society forTesting and Materials (ASTM) analytical test methods ASTM D129-64 (Reapproved1978), ASTM D1552-83, ASTM D2622-87, or ASTM D1266-87. The results arereported as a 7-day rolling average. This represents a change since proposal,when results were reported as a 7-day calendar average. One sample is requiredper 8-hour period. Each 7-day period during which the owner or operator does not meet theapplicable standards is a violation of that standard. For example, if anowner or operator seeks to comply with the feed sulfur cutoff, each 7-dayperiod for which the average feed sulfur level exceeds 0.30 weight percentis a violation of the standard. Failure to meet the minimum data requirements(that is, 22 valid days of data out of 30 days) during any rolling 30-dayperiod of successive calendar days for the standards for FCCU's with add-oncontrols is also considered a violation of the standards. Quarterly reporting is required for all periods in which a violation occurs.These reports include information on any 7-day period during which a violationof the standard has occurred and any 30-day period during which the minimumdata requirements have not been met. This information includes the datethe violation occurred; an explanation for the violation; whether the violationwas concurrent with startup, shutdown, or malfunction of the FCCU or controlsystem; and a description of the corrective action taken, if any. If noviolations occur during a quarter, then a semiannual report may be submitted.However, if an owner or operator elects to comply with an alternative standard,a quarterly report must be submitted to the Administrator in the quarterfollowing such a change even if no violations of a standard have occurred.Whether or not a violation has occurred, for any single calendar day inwhich 18 valid hours of CEMS data, a Method 8 test result, or 3 test resultsfor feed sulfur content were not obtained as required by these standards,the dates for and brief explanations as to why such data were not obtainedshall still be included in the quarterly (or semiannual) report. Recordsof continuous monitoring data and calibrations, supplemental sampling testresults, Method 8 test results, feed sulfur test results, and each 7-dayaverage compliance determination must be maintained by the owner or operatorof the affected facility and be available for inspection by EPA for 2 years.In addition, the standards require refiners to submit notification andcompliance reports in accordance with the General Provisions (40 CFR part60, subpart A). The promulgated standards would also amend the standards in Subpart J forfuel gas combustion devices by deleting an incorrect duplication of thedefinition of excess emissions of SO<T2>2</T2>, i.e., deleting 40 CFR 60.105(e)(4).<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Environmental Impacts </ITAG>The promulgated standards are based on the application of BDT to controlFCCU SO<T2>X</T2> emissions. The EPA determined, considering costs, environmental,energy, and non-air quality health impacts that scrubbers effectively controlFCCU SO<T2>X</T2> emissions and are BDT. However, refiners may also use SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalysts, naturally occurring low sulfur FCCU feedstocks,or hydrotreated FCCU feedstocks to meet these standards. To estimate the impacts of the promulgated standards, EPA projected that17 newly constructed, modified, and reconstructed FCCU regenerators wouldbe affected by the standards during the first 5 years after the effectivedate of the standards. Assuming that scrubbing systems are used at allaffected facilities processing feedstocks containing greater than 0.30weight percent sulfur, EPA estimates that the promulgated standards wouldreduce fifth year nationwide SO<T2>X</T2> emissions by about 69,000 megagrams per year (Mg/yr). If, instead,these same facilities processing feeds greater than 0.30 weight percentsulfur elected to comply with the standard for FCCU's without add-on controls,fifth year nationwide SO<T2>X</T2> emissions would be reduced by about 63,000 Mg/yr. Application of sodium-based scrubbers to control SO<T2>X</T2> emissions from the affected facilities would increase fifthyear nationwide wastewater discharges by about 2.2andmultiply;10\6\ cubicmeters per year (m\3\/yr). Wastewater from sodium-based scrubbers designedto control both particulates and SO<T2>X</T2> emissions from FCCU's is treated to reduce collected particulatesand chemical oxygen demand. The treated discharge from these scrubberswould contain about 90 Mg/yr of suspended solids and chemical oxygen demand,and about 110 gigagrams per year (Gg/yr) of total dissolved solids in thefifth year of the standards. The discharge from sodium-based scrubbersdesigned to control only SO<T2>X</T2> would not produce significant quantities of solid wastes. The sodium scrubbers that are currently applied to FCCU's control bothparticulate emissions as well as SO<T2>X</T2> emissions. With this type of scrubber, an additional particulatecontrol device would not be required to achieve the current FCCU particulatestandard. Control of FCCU particulate emissions (primarily catalyst fines)by a sodium scrubber does not incrementally increase the dry weight ofsolid wastes over control by a dry particulate control device, such asan electrostatic precipitator (ESP). Therefore, the amount of particulatescollected by the sodium scrubbers are not ``chargeable'' to the SO<T2>X</T2> standards. However, particulates collected in a scrubber wouldbe wet, and thus, weigh more and encompass a larger volume. The increasedue to the amount of water added to the solids is ``chargeable'' to theSO<T2>X</T2> standards. The fifth year nationwide incremental increase insolid wastes produced by application of sodium scrubbers is estimated tobe about 14 Gg/yr. At refinery locations where the disposal of a treated wastestream froma sodium scrubber is not permitted, a refiner would need to use other SO<T2>X</T2> control techniques with minimal wastewater impacts. Alternativescrubbing systems include dual alkali or spray drying scrubbing systems,which produce no significant liquid wastes but instead produce solid wastes.Other alternatives are Wellman-Lord or citrate scrubbing systems, whichproduce no significant liquid wastes but instead produce a salable sulfurproduct. If dual alkali scrubbers are used to control SO<T2>X</T2> emissions from all affected facilities with feed sulfur levelsabove 0.30 percent, solid wastes would increase over baseline by 325 Gg/yrin the fifth year. The use of SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalysts may increase FCCU particulate emissions,and hence, increase solid wastes collected by the particulate control device.It is difficult to approximate this increase, however, because the catalysttechnology is still in the developmental stages. It is unlikely that theuse of SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalysts would significantly increase FCCU solidwaste impacts over current levels. Wastewater discharges would not increasewith the use of SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalysts. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Energy Impacts </ITAG>The promulgated standards would have a small impact on nationwide energyconsumption. Sodium scrubbers would increase FCCU energy consumption fornew, modified, and reconstructed FCCU's by about 0.2 to 2.0 percent, dependingon the regeneration mode of the FCCU and type of venturi scrubber used.Other scrubbing systems, particularly regenerable systems such as Wellman-Lordand citrate scrubbers, would have a greater energy impact. However, EPAexpects few refiners to use regenerable scrubbing systems. No energy increaseis expected from use of SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalysts. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Cost Impacts </ITAG>The costs for these standards have changed somewhat since proposal. Costswere revised to account for inflation and to better reflect the cost ofretrofitting scrubbers at existing refineries. The EPA estimates that ifsodium-based scrubbers are used at all affected facilities with feed sulfurlevels above 0.30 percent by weight, the promulgated standards would resultin a 5-year total nationwide capital cost of $117 million and an annualcost of $45 million (reported in fourth quarter 1984 dollars) in the fifthyear after the effective date of the standards. Units processing feedswith sulfur contents of 0.30 percent by weight would be below the feedsulfur cutoff and, therefore, not need to install a scrubber. Where sodiumscrubbers are not applicable, dual alkali scrubbers could be used at asimilar cost to sodium scrubbers. If all affected facilities used SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalysts, SO<T2>X</T2> emissions control would cost about $20 million to $50 millionin the fifth year of the standards. SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalyst costs are presented as a range because thetechnology is under development. The upper end of the range representsa catalyst formulation that is the earlier stages of development; the developerof this catalyst expects the cost to decrease as the catalyst formulationis produced in greater quantities. The cost of SO<T2>X</T2> control, if all affected facilities with feed sulfur levelsgreater than 0.30 weight percent used scrubbers, would be approximately$660/Mg of SO<T2>X</T2> removed. Based on catalyst developer claims of SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalyst performance and cost, SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalysts, when used at those affected facilitieswith feed sulfur levels greater than 0.30 weight percent but less thanor equal to 1.5 weight percent, are estimated to cost from $320 to $850/Mgof SO<T2>X</T2> removed. Affected facilities processing feeds containing greaterthan 1.5 weight percent sulfur would likely use scrubbers. These affectedfacilities would incur a cost of less than $660/Mg of SO<T2>X</T2> removed. The cost of scrubbing for FCCU's processing feeds containing slightly greaterthan 0.30 weight percent sulfur would be approximately $1,900/Mg of SO<T2>X</T2> removed. However, EPA does not expect refiners processing feedswith sulfur contents slightly greater than 0.30 weight percent actuallyto incur a cost of $1,900 to remove each megagram of SO<T2>X</T2> emissions. This is because these refiners are the ones mostlikely to use SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalysts rather than install a scrubber.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Economic Impact </ITAG>The economic impact of the standards will be small even if all affectedfacilities use flue gas scrubbers. The price increases presented in theproposal BID were all less than 0.4 percent. Using the revised controlcosts and second quarter 1984 product prices, that figure increases toapproximately 0.8 percent in the worst case. Even without passing throughprice increases, the standards are not expected to reduce the profitabilityof FCCU operations to the point where planned investments would be postponed.The EPA does not consider these percentages sufficiently high to detera decision to install an FCCU that is otherwise economically justified.The environmental, energy, and economic impacts are discussed in greaterdetail in the BID for the proposed standards, ``Sulfur Oxides Emissionsfrom Fluid Catalytic Cracking Unit Regenerators_Background Informationfor Proposed Standards,'' EPA-450/3-82-013a. <ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Public Participation </ITAG>Prior to proposal of the standards, interested parties were advised bypublic notice in the <T4>Federal Register </T4> (46 FR 55000, November 5, 1981) of a meetingof the National Air Pollution Control Techniques Advisory Committee todiscuss the standards for FCCU regenerators recommended for proposal. Thismeeting was held on December 1, 1981. The meeting was open to the publicand each attendee was given an opportunity to comment on the standardsrecommended for proposal. The proposed standards were published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4> on January 17, 1984 (49 FR 2058). The preambleto the proposed standards described the availability of the BID, ``SulfurOxides Emissions from Fluid Catalytic Cracking Unit Regenerators_BackgroundInformation for Proposed Standards,'' EPA-450/3-82-013a, which describedin detail the regulatory alternatives considered and the impacts of thosealternatives. Public comments were solicited at the time of proposal andcopies of the proposal BID were distributed to interested parties. TheAgency published a revised proposal in the <T4>Federal Register </T4> on November 8, 1985 (50 FR 46464). Public commentson the revised proposal were solicited at the time of their proposal andcopies of the revised proposal were distributed to interested parties.The public was also given the opportunity for oral presentation of data,views, or arguments concerning the proposed standards in accordance withsection 307(d)(5) of the Clean Air Act. No one requested a public hearing,so a public hearing was not held. The original public comment period was from January 17 to April 3, 1984.This comment period was reopened on November 8, 1985, and extended throughDecember 9, 1985, in order to allow interested parties to comment specificallyon the proposed revisions. A total of 30 comment letters were received.The comments have been carefully considered and, where determined to beappropriate by the Administrator, changes have been made in the proposedstandards. <ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Significant Comments and Changes to the Proposed Standards </ITAG>Comments on the proposed standards were received from industry, State andlocal air pollution control agencies, trade associations, a private individual,and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). A detailed discussion ofthese comments and responses can be found in the promulgation BID, whichis referred to in the <T4>ADDRESSES</T4> section of this preamble. The summary of comments andresponses in the BID serve as the basis for the revisions that have beenmade to the standards between proposal and promulgation. The major commentsand responses are summarized in this preamble. Most of the comment letterscontained multiple comments. The comments have been divided into the followingareas: The Standards, Control Technologies and Economic Impacts, ComplianceTesting and Monitoring, Compliance, and Modification/ Reconstruction. The Standards <ITAG tagnum="81">Applicability </ITAG><T3>Comment (Regulated Pollutant):</T3> In the revised proposed standards(50 FR 46464), the Agency proposed to change the regulated pollutant fromSO<T2>X</T2> to SO<T2>2</T2> for the standard with add-on controls, but keep SO<T2>X</T2> as the regulated pollutant for the standard without add-on controls.Comments were received only on SO<T2>X</T2> as the regulated pollutant for the standard without add-on controls.Several commenters suggested that EPA use SO<T2>2</T2> rather than SO<T2>X</T2> as the regulated pollutant for the standard for SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalysts. Among the arguments presented by the commenterswere that: (1) Emerging SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalyst data indicate that sulfur trioxide (SO<T2>3</T2>) is unaffected by the catalysts; (2) preliminary data previouslysubmitted to EPA from several SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalyst trials at one of their refineries generallyindicate only an insignificant amount of SO<T2>3</T2> in the SO<T2>X</T2> emissions; (3) using SO<T2>2</T2> as the regulated pollutant enables the same monitoring technique(proven SO<T2>2</T2> monitors) to be used as for add-on scrubber technology, resultingin cost savings and sample consistency and reliability; and (4) other refinerysources are only regulated for SO<T2>2</T2> and EPA usually regulates only SO<T2>2</T2>. <T3>Response:</T3> The Agency has considered the arguments presented bythe commenters and reviewed the data available on the composition of SO<T2>X</T2> when using SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalysts. After this review, the Agency still believesthat the most appropriate regulated pollutant for SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalysts is SO<T2>X</T2>, not SO<T2>2</T2>. The Agency recontacted SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalyst vendors to review the mechanism by whichSO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalysts reduce total SO<T2>X</T2> emissions. The SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalyst vendors indicate that SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalysts preferentially remove SO<T2>3</T2>, forming a metal sulfate compound that is much more stable thanthe metal sulfite compound formed when the SO<T2>2</T2> reacts with the catalyst. As the SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalyst picks up more and more SO<T2>3</T2>, the equilibrium balance is disturbed. To regain equilibrium,more SO<T2>2</T2> becomes SO<T2>3</T2>. If the rate of SO<T2>2</T2> to SO<T2>3</T2> is less than the rate of metal sulfate formation (SO<T2>3</T2> plus metal oxide), then the SO<T2>3</T2> percentage in the FCCU emissions will decrease. If the SO<T2>2</T2> to SO<T2>3</T2> rate is faster than the metal sulfate formation rate, then theratio of SO<T2>2</T2> to SO<T2>3</T2> will remain the same. In order for the percentage of SO<T2>3</T2> to increase, other operating parameters of the regenerator wouldhave to change in order to change the thermodynamic equilibrium. To ensuremaximum SO<T2>X</T2> removal efficiency, the owner or operator would likely operatea regenerator, to the extent possible, in such a manner that the SO<T2>2</T2> to SO<T2>3</T2> rate is not limiting; that is, create conditions within theregenerator that increase the SO<T2>3</T2> percentage. The Agency again reviewed the data on the SO<T2>2</T2>/SO<T2>3</T2> ratio in regenerator emissions, including that most recentlysubmitted by several commenters. The Agency requested in the revised proposalthat any data that were available on this be submitted. Very little datawere submitted. The data base, therefore, remains very limited and inconclusive.The more recent data generally tend to have a lower percentage of SO<T2>3</T2> than the earlier data. Some of the recent data still suggest,however, that there is a potential for large amounts of SO<T2>3</T2> to be emitted, which would be undetected by a standard usingSO<T2>2</T2> as the regulated pollutant. Thus, regulating SO<T2>2</T2> only will not necessarily reflect the potential control of SO<T2>X</T2> that can be obtained by SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalysts. The Agency requested, but did not receive, data on the possibility thatthe plume opacity standard for FCCU's may help limit the emissions of SO<T2>3</T2>. Plume opacity is affected by the condensation of SO<T2>3</T2> and, to the extent this condensation affects the ability ofa source to comply with the opacity standard, it may also help limit theemissions of SO<T2>3</T2>. If sufficient data had been presented, the Agency would haveconsidered changing the regulated pollutant for FCCU's without add-on controlsfrom SO<T2>X</T2> to SO<T2>2</T2> so that SO<T2>2</T2> CEMS's could be used for compliance determinations. The arguments relating to the advantages of SO<T2>2</T2> monitoring are outweighed by the need for an SO<T2>X</T2> standard for the reasons described above. The fact that otherrefinery sources are only regulated for SO<T2>2</T2> sheds no light on whether an SO<T2>X</T2> standard is appropriate for this source. <T3>Comment (Affected Facility):</T3> Several commenters stated that thedesignation of the affected facility should be broadened to include theentire FCCU, and that the definition of ``fresh feed'' should be clarified.<T3>Response: </T3>At proposal, the affected facility was designated aseach individual FCCU regenerator and air blower. The rationale for thisselection of the affected facility was presented in the preamble to theproposed standards (49 FR 2060). As stated in the preamble, SO<T2>X</T2> are generated in and emitted from the FCCU regenerator. Thedesignation of the regenerator of each FCCU as the affected facility, ratherthan the entire FCCU, would lead to bringing replacement equipment underthese standards sooner and thus, would adhere to the purpose of section111 of the Clean Air Act. The EPA anticipates that few, if any, FCCU's utilizing multiple regeneratorswill become subject to these standards over the next 5 years. However,identifying each FCCU regenerator as the affected facility for multipleregenerator configurations is unreasonable. If only one regenerator ina multiple regenerator configuration were to become subject to the standards,it would be impossible in some multiple regenerator ducting arrangementsto isolate and measure the SO<T2>X</T2> content of the exhaust gases from the affected regenerator.Furthermore, because the refiner would want to minimize the cost and downtimefor revamping work on the unit, it is unlikely that only one regeneratorin a multiple regenerator configuration would be modified or reconstructedwithout the others. Therefore, the affected facility is now defined toinclude all regenerators serving an FCCU reactor. The proposed definition of ``fresh feed'' specifically excluded those petroleumderivatives recycled within the FCCU. To ensure that a refiner would notcircumvent the feed sulfur cutoff by adding low-sulfur content recyclefrom the fractionator and gas recovery unit, EPA has revised the definitionof ``fresh feed'' in the regulation. The revised definition specificallyidentifies petroleum derivatives from the FCCU, fractionator, and gas recoveryunit as recycle, and thus excludes them from the definition of ``freshfeed.'' <T3>Comment (RCC/ART Units): </T3>One commenter stated that the proposedstandards should not apply to RCC process or ART units, because the RCCunit is designed to process residual feedstocks, and the ART unit is afeedstock upgrading unit, and, therefore, these units are not FCCU's. <T3>Response: </T3>To upgrade residual feedstocks and to increase gasolineand middle distillate product yields, new processes termed HOC, which includesRCC, and ART are being installed at refineries. The HOC units are FCCU'sthat process residual and other heavy oil feedstocks. As in a conventionalFCCU, emissions occur as a result of catalyst regeneration. Sulfur oxideemissions may, in fact, be greater from HOC units than from other FCCU'sbecause HOC feedstocks have a higher coke make rate than gas oil feedsand a greater portion of the sulfur in HOC feedstocks forms coke than thatin gas oil feeds. The EPA's analysis of SO<T2>X</T2> emissions, control costs, and cost effectiveness for HOC unitsshowed that the proposed standards for FCCU's are achievable and affordablefor HOC units. The results of this analysis were presented in AppendixF of the proposal BID. Emissions, emission control, and control costs for the ART process werefurther evaluated by EPA. The differences stated by the commenter betweenan ART unit and an FCCU do exist: The ART process does not employ a catalyst,but rather uses an inert microspheric contact material that collects contaminants;the objective of the ART process is feedstock upgrading, not processing;and some of the operating conditions may vary significantly. Nevertheless, important similarities in regenerator configuration, operation,and emissions exist that warrant the regulation of an ART unit under theFCCU new source performance standards (NSPS). For both an ART unit anda conventional FCCU, regeneration is performed to burn off coke from thecatalyst or contact material, thereby restoring it for reuse in the unit.Opacity and emissions of CO, SO<T2>X</T2>, and particulate from an ART unit regenerator during normaloperation are expected to be within the range of emissions from all typesof FCCU regenerators, including those from HOC units. The EPA evaluatedcontrol feasibility and cost for an ART unit based on reported emissionsand determined that control of an ART unit by a scrubber was applicableand had a reasonable cost. Based on a scrubber SO<T2>X</T2> efficiency of 90 percent, the scrubber cost effectiveness calculatedfor the ART unit is below the range of cost effectiveness expected forFCCU's. In addition, costs to control CO emissions, if necessary, and particulateemissions are estimated to be reasonable. The similarity in emissions from the regenerator and the availability ofcontrol equipment at a reasonable cost indicate that the ART unit regeneratorcan meet the FCCU standards. The facts that the objective of the ART processis different than that of the FCCU and that the material being regeneratedis not a catalyst are not significant reasons to support the contentionthat an ART unit should not be subject to the FCCU NSPS. Therefore, thefinal standards require, as proposed, that an ART unit, HOC unit, or anyother similar type of fluidized bed treatment unit regenerator achievethe FCCU particulate, opacity, CO, and SO<T2>X</T2> standards. <ITAG tagnum="81">Format of the Standards </ITAG><T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters stated that EPA should establish asingle SO<T2>X</T2> standard for FCCU's because it would allow refiners the optionsand flexibility of determining the most cost-effective method of meetingthat limit and it would comply with Section 111(h) of the Clean Air Act,which implies that the Administrator should prescribe a performance standardrather than a work practice or equipment standard, where feasible to doso. <T3>Response: </T3>To develop SO<T2>X</T2> emission standards for FCCU's, EPA evaluated all available techniquesfor controlling FCCU SO<T2>X</T2> emissions. Upon thorough consideration of the availability,SO<T2>X</T2> emission reduction capability, and impacts associated with eachof these techniques, EPA determined that scrubbing systems effectivelycontrol SOT2X emissions from all types of FCCU applications, and representBDT for FCCU SO<T2>X</T2> and SO<T2>2</T2> emissions. The percent reduction format was selected because it best reflects theperformance of add-on controls for all expected feed sulfur levels. Thisis consistent with section 111(a)(1), which requires that the standardreflect application of BDT. However, for many FCCU applications, SO<T2>X</T2> emissions can be reduced effectively and continuously withoutthe use of add-on controls. This can be achieved by using SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalysts or low sulfur FCCU feedstocks obtained byeither hydrotreating high sulfur feedstocks or processing naturally occurringlow sulfur crude oils. Although these techniques may be less effectiveat reducing SO<T2>X</T2> emissions than scrubbers for some FCCU applications, they havelower costs and smaller non-air environmental impacts than scrubbers. TheEPA judged that it is reasonable to give up some emission reduction byestablishing a standard without add-on controls in return for the otherbenefits afforded by using SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalysts, hydrotreating, or low sulfur feedstocksinstead of scrubbers. Therefore, EPA has established alternative standardsfor the sources that can effectively and continuously reduce SO<T2>X</T2> emissions without the use of add-on controls. If a refiner believesthat using SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalysts, hydrotreating, or low sulfur feedstocksfor his particular FCCU application will not achieve the standard withoutadd-on controls, then the refiner can still install and operate an add-oncontrol device that achieves 90 percent reduction of SO<T2>2</T2> emissions. The standards are performance standards and are consistent with section111 of the Clean Air Act. Neither the add-on control standard nor the standardfor FCCU's without add-on controls specifies the type of controls thatmust be used or exactly how the controls are to be operated to achievethe standard. One commenter noted that by partial scrubbing of the FCCU regenerator exhaustgases, the emission level represented by the standard for FCCU's withoutadd-on controls could be achieved for some FCCU applications. However,the 90 percent standard is intended to reflect the capability of scrubbers,which can achieve 90 percent control of the entire exhaust stream. A relaxationof the standard to 9.8 kg SO<T2>X</T2>/1,000 kg coke burn-off would cause it to no longer reflect thecapability of scrubbers. <T3>Comment: </T3>Commenters questioned the coke burn-off format proposedby EPA for the standard for FCCU's without add-on controls. They notedthat the coke burn-off format does not allow for variation in coke sulfurcontent and will discourage process improvements. They stated that EPAshould consider a percent reduction format and a format in kilograms ofSO<T2>X</T2> per thousand barrels of feed. <T3>Response: </T3>Based on a sensitivity analysis presented in AppendixF of the proposal BID, EPA concluded that the coke burn-off format relateswell to normal fluctuations in SO<T2>X</T2> emissions from FCCU's processing a variety of feeds. This isbecause SO<T2>X</T2> emissions are related directly to the coke sulfur content. Normally,FCCU's are operated to limit the amount of coke that can be burned offin the regenerator. Process improvements that reduce the coke make rateare made to allow the refiner to process more feed through the unit untilthe unit is again limited in the amount of coke it can burn off. An exampleof a process improvement that results in reduced coke make is high temperatureregeneration (HTR). The initial result of HTR would be reduced SO<T2>X</T2> emissions from FCCU's on a mass basis. However, SO<T2>X</T2> emissions in terms of coke burn-off would remain the same becauseSO<T2>X</T2> emissions are related to the sulfur on coke. Thus, the refinercould increase throughput until the unit is again coke burn-off limitedand still be within the standard even though emissions would increase.This format offers greater refining flexibility than a mass of SO<T2>X</T2> per unit of feed basis. The commenters provided no new informationto refute this conclusion.<T3/>A sliding scale format that allows for variation in coke sulfur contentwould be difficult to enforce because the sulfur content of the coke oncatalyst is not readily obtainable. For this reason, EPA considers a slidingscale format unreasonable. The EPA considered a percent reduction format for the standard for FCCU'swithout add-on controls, but rejected it because of compliance considerations.With SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalysts, there is no uncontrolled or inlet SO<T2>X</T2> concentration to measure. Thus, it would be impossible to determinethrough stack testing the percent reduction being achieved by the catalysts.An alternative method would be to estimate the percent reduction achievedby SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalysts using EPA's correlation of feed sulfur withSO<T2>X</T2> emissions. However, EPA's correlation represents an averagefor all FCCU's and feedstocks. While the correlation is useful for analyzingthe overall impact of the standards, inlet SO<T2>X</T2> concentrations may be lower or higher than the level predictedby the correlation for a specific FCCU and feedstock. Thus, the correlationcannot be used on a case-by-case basis. The cost to develop a separatecorrelation for each feedstock and FCCU affected by the standards is unreasonable.Because there is not a practical method for determining the SO<T2>X</T2> inlet concentration when using SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalysts, EPA did not select a percent reductionformat. The EPA considers the coke burn-off format reasonable because of its directrelationship to the sulfur-on-coke relationship. The coke burn-off formatis identical to the format selected for the NSPS particulate standard;the coke burn-off rate can be recorded reasonably and would be readilyavailable. <ITAG tagnum="81">Level of Standards </ITAG><T3>Comment (Without Add-On Controls): </T3>Many commenters stated thatthe standard for FCCU's without add-on controls should be set at 13 kgSO<T2>X</T2>/1,000 kg coke burn-off because 80 percent reductions by SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalysts are not supported by the limited commercialtests cited by EPA. Also, a 13 kg SO<T2>X</T2>/1,000 kg coke burn-off emission limit would allow more refinersto use the catalysts rather than add-on controls. The commenters believethat SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalysts are the only cost-effective and environmentallyacceptable control alternative. One commenter stated that the emissionreduction required by the standard for FCCU's without add-on controls isessentially equivalent to the level of control required by the Texas AirControl Board (TACB) to control FCCU SO<T2>X</T2> emissions. <T3>Response: </T3>The EPA disagrees with the comment that SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalysts are the only cost-effective and environmentallyacceptable control alternative. The EPA determined, considering costs,environmental, energy, and non-air quality health impacts, that scrubberseffectively control FCCU SO<T2>X</T2> emissions and are BDT. Furthermore, as an alternative to usingSO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalysts, refiners may use hydrotreating or low sulfurfeedstocks to achieve compliance with the 9.8 kg SO<T2>X</T2>/1,000 kg coke burn-off level. The level of the standard (9.8 kg SO<T2>X</T2>/1,000 kg coke burn-off) was selected to allow refiners flexibilityto use SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalysts with best currently available performance,and to encourage the further development of the catalyst technology. Formany feedstocks, especially those with lower sulfur content, the emissionreduction needed to achieve the level of the standard is less than 80 percent.For example, a feedstock with 0.5 weight percent sulfur would need approximately50 percent reduction in SO<T2>X</T2> emissions to achieve the level of the standard. In responseto the comments, EPA contacted a number of companies known to be developingSO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalysts to request updated information on the performanceand availability of developmental SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalysts. Based on a survey of SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalyst developers, current commercial SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalyst test data have been reported by the developersto reduce FCCU SO<T2>X</T2> emissions by 65 to 75 percent. The test data reported by thedevelopers span a wide range of catalyst performance; some data pointsshow catalyst performance as high as 90 percent. As the technology continuesto develop, refiners will be able to use the catalyst technology to achievethe standard for a greater range of feedstocks. Based on the results of SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalyst tests, EPA believes the level of the standardfor FCCU's without add-on controls is reasonable. The determination ofthe level of this standard included consideration of the benefits of SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalysts and the increase in SO<T2>X</T2> emissions compared to the BDT of scrubbing. Because the primarypurpose of the standards is to reduce future FCCU SO<T2>X</T2> emissions, and scrubbers can achieve cost-effective emissionreductions, EPA concluded that it is not reasonable to further increaseallowable emissions by raising the level of the standard. Should a refinerfind that SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalysts will not reduce emissions sufficiently toachieve the 9.8 kg SO<T2>X</T2>/1,000 kg coke burn-off level, the refiner still has the flexibilityto use hydrotreating alone or in combination with SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalysts, to choose a lower sulfur content feedstock,or to install a scrubber. <T3>Comment (Feed Sulfur Cutoff): </T3>Two commenters stated that an arbitraryfeed sulfur cutoff of 0.30 weight percent sulfur is too restrictive, suggestingthat a feed sulfur cutoff equivalent to 9.8 kg SO<T2>X</T2>/1,000 kg coke burn-off be established by developing a correlationbetween feed sulfur content and SO<T2>X</T2> production based on test data.<T3>Response:</T3> The selection of the feed sulfur cutoff level of 0.30weight percent was not arbitrary. As was discussed in the preamble to theproposed standards, the feed sulfur cutoff level was selected based onconsideration of the costs for application of scrubbers to control SO<T2>X</T2> emissions from FCCU's processing low sulfur feedstocks, andthe feedstock sulfur levels refiners are expected to be processing if theyelect to use naturally occurring low sulfur feed or to hydrotreat highsulfur feeds. A correlation between FCCU feed sulfur content and SO<T2>X</T2> emissions is presented on p. 3-18 of the proposal BID. The correlationis based on test data for a large number of FCCU's and feedstock types.Based on this correlation, an FCCU SO<T2>X</T2> emission level of 9.8 kg SO<T2>X</T2>/1,000 kg coke burn-off corresponds to a feed sulfur level ofapproximately 0.3 weight percent. Thus, the feed sulfur cutoff level establishedby EPA is approximately equivalent to the standard for FCCU's without add-oncontrols. <ITAG tagnum="81">Averaging Times </ITAG><T3>Comment:</T3> Commenters stated that the averaging time for the standardsshould be increased. Several commenters suggested a 7-day averaging periodfor compliance because it would be consistent with the averaging time forthe feed sulfur cutoff; no process variables could be adjusted in a 3-hourperiod to regulate SO<T2>2</T2> emissions when using SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalysts; and 7 days would account for variationin SO<T2>2</T2> inlet concentrations to the control device whereas 3 hours wouldnot.<T3>Response:</T3> After assessing the long-term variability by statisticallyanalyzing in a times series analysis of the continuous SO<T2>2</T2> monitoring data from an EPA study of a sodium scrubber appliedto an FCCU, the EPA agrees that the averaging time for compliance withthe standards for FCCU's with and without add-on controls should be lengthened.The revised proposed standards included a revision of the compliance averagingtime from 3 hours to 7 days. Six commenters agreed with EPA's revision.No commenters disagreed. <T3>Comment:</T3> Two commenters stated that the averaging period for thefeed sulfur cutoff should be a 30-day rolling average period. The use ofthe 30-day period would be appropriate because a 30-day rolling averageperiod is used for the fossil fuel-fired steam generator NSPS. <T3>Response:</T3> Whenever practical, EPA determines NSPS regulatory requirementson an individual source category basis. It is not appropriate to use a30-day rolling average period for the FCCU feed sulfur cutoff standardsimply to copy the fossil fuel-fired steam generator NSPS. The proposed7-day averaging period was selected by EPA after careful considerationof a range of averaging periods. A daily averaging time was judged by EPAto be too short to account for sampling variability. Also, a daily averagingtime would constrain a refiner's flexibility in blending different typesof feedstocks for processing in the FCCU. A 7-day averaging time wouldreduce sampling variability and increase refiner flexibility in selectingthe FCCU feedstock mix. However, increasing the averaging time beyond a7-day period would allow feedstocks with sulfur contents significantlygreater than 0.30 weight percent to be processed in the FCCU during a portionof the sampling period. Consequently, a refiner would be able to processhigh sulfur feedstocks without having to use any SO<T2>X</T2> controls. This would be inconsistent with the intent of thestandards to apply BDT to control emissions from the regenerator of FCCU'sprocessing feedstocks with more than 0.3 weight percent sulfur. Therefore,EPA selected the 7-day averaging period to allow reasonable flexibilityto the refiner for processing different sulfur content feedstocks. Control Technologies and Economic Impacts <ITAG tagnum="81">SO</ITAG><T2>X</T2> Scrubbers <T3>Comment (Performance):</T3> Some commenters challenged EPA's assessmentof the performance of scrubbers as applied to FCCU's. These commentersexpressed the opinion that scrubbers should not be considered BDT becausethey are not demonstrated on high sulfur feeds and have poor operability.Another commenter supported EPA's statements that scrubbers can achieve90 percent reductions in SO<T2>2</T2> emissions over the expected range of inlet SO<T2>2</T2> concentrations. <T3>Response:</T3> Scrubber SO<T2>X</T2> control is a function of the scrubbing liquor sorbent and goodcontact between the SO<T2>X</T2>-containing flue gas and the scrubbing liquor. Based on engineeringjudgment, scrubbers applied to higher SO<T2>X</T2>-containing gas streams would be expected to operate as wellas those scrubbers applied to lower SO<T2>X</T2>-containing gas streams. However, because scrubbers have notbeen applied to FCCU's processing high sulfur feeds, none was availablefor testing by EPA to confirm scrubber performance. Therefore, EPA comparedthe composition of FCCU exhaust gases to industrial boiler flue gases todetermine if the performance of sodium scrubbers for industrial boilersis applicable to FCCU's processing high sulfur feedstocks. This comparisonshowed that the coke formed on the FCCU catalyst is a carbonaceous materialsimilar to the coal used in solid fuel-fired industrial boilers. The catalystcoke is burned off the catalyst during regeneration by adding air to theregenerator. The regeneration process is thus similar to the combustionprocesses that take place in boilers. Given the similarities between catalystcoke and other solid fuels, the combustion process that takes place inthe FCCU regenerator is expected to yield exhaust gases that are similarto those derived from coal-fired boilers. A comparison between FCCU regeneratorexhaust gases and industrial boiler flue gases was presented in Table 4-3in the proposal BID. The comparison showed that the ranges in concentrationof most FCCU regenerator exhaust gas constituents (nitrogen (N<T2>2</T2>), oxygen (O<T2>2</T2>), carbon dioxide (CO<T2>2</T2>), SO<T2>X</T2>, nitrous oxides (NO<T2>X</T2>)) are similar to the boiler flue gas concentrations. Scrubbersystems installed on FCCU regenerators will thus experience similar inletconcentrations as boiler scrubber systems. The primary difference between FCCU regenerator exhaust gases and boilerflue gases is the particulate emissions. Boiler particulate emissions arehigher and composed primarily of fly ash. Catalyst fines comprise the majorityof regenerator particulate emissions. In an industrial boiler application,fly ash is typically collected upstream of a non-venturi type scrubber.A similar type of scrubber applied to an FCCU would require particulatecontrol upstream from the scrubber. According to scrubber vendors, theparticulates that pass through the particulate control device would notaffect the design of the scrubber regardless of the application. This isbecause catalyst fines are no more erosive than fly ash and neither typeof particulate would interfere with the scrubbing reaction. Thus, the differencein particulates from an industrial boiler and an FCCU are not expectedto affect scrubber performance. A second, less important difference is that hydrocarbon emissions fromFCCU regenerators may be higher than those from boilers. The presence ofhydrocarbons in the FCCU gas stream will not affect scrubber operationor performance. Due to the low solubility of hydrocarbons in the aqueousscrubbing liquor, the hydrocarbons will not be absorbed, but will passthrough the scrubber to the atmosphere. Other differences in gas compositionsare minor and are not expected to invalidate the applicability of scrubbersystems for FCCU regenerators. The similarities in flue gas flow rates and characteristics between industrialboilers and FCCU's and consideration of their differences support the reasonableconclusion that industrial boiler sodium scrubber performance is applicableto FCCU's. The commenter did not provide any information to show that scrubberperformance for industrial boilers would be different than scrubber performancefor FCCU's. Source test results for a sodium scrubber applied to an industrial boilerburning a high sulfur fuel show that sodium scrubbers can achieve at least90 percent reduction in SO<T2>X</T2> emissions at high inlet SO<T2>X</T2> concentrations. Therefore, in consideration of the above mentionedsimilarities, EPA has reasonably concluded that the FCCU standard is achievableand that scrubbers are applicable over the expected range of FCCU regeneratorexhaust gas sulfur concentrations. At proposal, sodium scrubbing systems had been effectively applied to sevenFCCU regenerators at five refineries to control SO<T2>X</T2> emissions. Since proposal, to the Agency's knowledge, two otherscrubbers controlling FCCU's at two refineries have begun operation. Thereis no information to show that the operation of these sodium scrubbershas increased FCCU shutdowns, reduced refinery capacity, or reduced refineryprofitability. Rather, the sodium scrubbers applied to FCCU's have operatedcontinuously with no failures between FCCU turnarounds. The commenter providedno data to support his claims that scrubbers have poor operability. Thus,EPA continues to believe scrubbers are an effective control method forreducing FCCU SO<T2>X</T2> emissions. <T3>Comment (Water Impacts):</T3> Five commenters stated that the wastedisposal aspects of the proposed standards are more complex than shownby the analysis presented in the proposal BID. Commenters stated that inlandrefiners would not be able to obtain a permit for the discharge of wasteliquids from sodium scrubbers and would need to install expensive additionalwastewater treatment systems to meet permitted discharge levels.<T3>Response:</T3> The petroleum refining effluent guidelines (40 CFR Part419) <T4>Federal Register</T4> technically apply to all wastewater from airpollution control devices when these wastes are treated with the main refinerywastewater or are discharged from the main refinery wastewater treatmentsystem. The costs for the treatment of these wastes are accounted for underthe Part 419 regulations. If the scrubber wastes are processed, treated,or discharged separately from the main refinery wastewater collection,treatment, or disposal system, then case-by-case determinations would bemade to regulate them. However, the major polluting characteristic of thetreated sodium scrubber wastestream is its high dissolved solids content,about 6 percent solids by weight, which consists primarily of sodium sulfates.There are currently no Federal regulations applicable to the dissolvedsolids content of the sodium scrubber wastestream. Instead, limitationson dissolved solids, where appropriate, would be developed on a case-by-casebasis outside of the Federal effluent guidelines. Such limitations shouldbe based on whether the receiving water body can still meet the relevantwater quality standard. For many refineries, the sodium scrubber wastewaterwould constitute a small portion of the total refinery wastewater flow.Thus, the dissolved solids content of the combined scrubber and treatedrefinery wastestreams may be within permit levels. All seven sodium scrubbers operating at the time of proposal to controlSO<T2>X</T2> and particulate emissions from FCCU's are located at coastallocations where no requirements exist for the discharge of sodium scrubberwastes to brackish or salt water. Further, at least one of the two scrubbersapplied to FCCU's since proposal discharges to brackish water. However,sodium scrubbers have been used extensively at inland locations to controlSO<T2>X</T2> emissions from industrial boilers. Waste disposal methods usedinclude discharge to a sewer, discharge to surface water, evaporative ponding,deep-well injection, and recycle. If a refiner elects to install a sodiumscrubber but cannot obtain a discharge permit, he will need to use oneof these disposal methods. These methods may be costly and have limitedavailability. However, other SO<T2>X</T2> scrubber systems with minimal wastewater impacts are applicableto FCCU's at a reasonable cost. These include dual alkali and spray dryingscrubbers, which have no significant liquid waste but instead produce solidwaste. There are also Wellman-Lord and citrate scrubbers, which have nosignificant liquid waste and produce a salable sulfur product. These scrubbingsystems have demonstrated removal efficiencies of 90 percent on industrialboilers. Due to the similarities between industrial boiler and FCCU fluegases, these scrubbing systems are applicable to FCCU's. The costs andcost effectiveness of these scrubbers were evaluated by EPA and are judgedto be reasonable. Alternatively, the refiner may choose to demonstratecompliance with the standard for FCCU's without add-on controls by usinghydrotreating or SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalysts, or by complying with the feed sulfur cutoffusing low sulfur feedstocks. <T3>Comment (Solid Waste Impacts):</T3> Two commenters questioned EPA'sassessment that sodium scrubbers would have no added cost impacts for solidwaste disposal. One commenter asked how EPA determined that sodium scrubberwaste is 50 percent water and felt that this increase in weight of totaldischarge would result in an incremental waste disposal cost ``chargeable''to this standard. The other commenter stated that scrubbing systems couldgreatly increase the amount of solids generated, and thus increase disposalcosts, provided disposal locations are available. <T3>Response:</T3> The sodium scrubbing systems that are currently appliedto FCCU's control both particulate emissions as well as SO<T2>X</T2> emissions. With this type of scrubber, an additional particulatecontrol device would not be required to achieve the current particulatestandard. Control of FCCU particulate emissions (primarily catalyst fines)by a sodium scrubber does not incrementally increase the dry weight ofsolid waste over control by a dry particulate control device, such as anESP. Therefore, the amount of particulate matter collected by the sodiumscrubbers are not ``chargeable'' to the SO<T2>X</T2> standards. However, solids collected in a scrubber would bewet and, thus, weigh more and encompass a larger volume. It will cost moreto transport and dispose solids collected in a scrubber to a landfill thandry solids. The increase due to the amount of water added to the solidsis ``chargeable'' to the SO<T2>X</T2> standards and is included as a solid waste cost (at $20.13/Mg)in the analysis of sodium scrubber costs. In addition, a ``liquid waste''disposal cost was added as a conservative estimate of the costs to disposetreated liquid scrubber waste to the sewer (see response to the commenton scrubber costs below). To determine the additional solid waste disposal cost due to the watercontained in settled scrubber solids (sludge), it was necessary to determinethe percent solids content of the scrubber solids. However, EPA had noinformation regarding the water content of the settled particulates (sludge)because none of the settling ponds used for sodium scrubbers applied toFCCU's had been emptied. Instead, EPA had information regarding the solidscontent of wastes for other scrubbing systems, such as dual alkali scrubbers.For these other systems, the percent of solids in the scrubber waste ishigher than that from sodium scrubbers, being typically 60 percent solids.The EPA assumed for cost purposes that the settled sodium scrubber wastewould be approximately 50 percent solids, by weight. Other types of nonregenerable scrubber systems, such as dual alkali, spraydrying, or lime/limestone scrubbers, generate greater quantities of solidwaste than generated by sodium scrubbers. A dual alkali scrubber controllingSO<T2>X</T2> emissions from an FCCU processing a 1.5 weight percent sulfurfeedstock will produce approximately 7,700 Mg/yr of solid waste for a 2,500m\3\/stream day (sd) FCCU and 25,000 Mg/yr for an 8,000  m\3\/sd FCCU.The EPA considers the solid waste impacts for these systems reasonable.Should solid waste disposal locations not be available, the refiner wouldneed to consider control techniques that do not produce solid waste, suchas regenerable scrubber systems (e.g., Wellman-Lord or citrate scrubberswhich produce salable sulfur products), hydrotreating, SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalysts, or low sulfur feedstocks.<T3>Comment (Air Impacts): </T3>Commenters questioned the appropriatenessof using scrubbers if they increase ground-level SO<T2>x</T2> concentrations and one commenter suggested that EPA requirereheating the scrubber exit gases to reduce ground-level concentrationsand to include reheat in the sodium scrubber cost analysis. <T3>Response: </T3>Scrubbing a gas stream lowers the temperature of thegas stream. Unless the gas stream is reheated downstream of the scrubber,the plume emitted from the scrubber stack will be cooler than the plumeemitted from an FCCU regenerator not using a scrubber. Lowering the temperatureof the plume reduces the effective height above the ground to which theplume will rise. The results of dispersion modeling performed by EPA and presented in theproposal BID were used to analyze the air quality impact of the proposedstandards. In all cases ground level SO<T2>x</T2> concentrations are within the national ambient air quality standards.For all the model plant scenarios except the one processing a low sulfurfeedstock, the ground level SO<T2>x</T2> concentrations predicted for implementation of the proposedstandards are lower than the baseline (uncontrolled) concentrations. Inthese cases, the decrease in SO<T2>x</T2> emissions afforded by implementation of scrubbers offsets thelower plume rise. The EPA agrees that if a control technique other than a scrubber was usedto achieve the same emission reduction as the scrubber would achieve, theresulting maximum ground level concentrations may be less than if a scrubberwere used. However, the application of SO<T2>x</T2> reduction catalysts to meet the standard for FCCU's withoutadd-on controls would provide less emission reduction than the applicationof scrubbers. The additional emission reduction provided by scrubbers wouldlikely compensate for the lower plume rise, so that the use of scrubberswould result in lower ground-level concentrations than the use of SO<T2>x</T2> reduction catalysts. The stack temperatures, heights, and exit velocities used in the modelinganalysis were selected as average values from data for actual FCCU scrubbers.Only one of the seven FCCU sodium scrubber installations existing at proposalis equipped with scrubber stack reheat. Reheat is used only occasionallyto reduce the visible steam plume during certain weather conditions. Forthis reason, EPA believes that the modeling input parameters selected andthe assumption of no reheat are appropriate. <T3>Comment (Scrubber Costs): </T3>Five commenters stated the opinion thatthe scrubber costs presented in the proposal BID are unrealistic and aresignificantly underestimated. The commenters claimed that the scrubbercost estimates should be 2.2 to 7 times higher. The commenter's specificcomments are identified in the response below. <T3>Response: </T3>To respond to these comments, EPA decided first to solicitmore detailed cost data for single alkali scrubbers from vendors and thento perform a general reevaluation of the cost data presented in the proposalBID. Concurrently, EPA solicited supplemental cost data from commentersand then addressed the individual comments pertaining to specific costitems. A. <T3>General Cost Review. </T3>First, EPA solicited data from scrubber vendorsother than the vendor who provided the costs on which the proposal BIDcost estimates were based. This vendor is the only one whose scrubber hasactually been installed on an FCCU. The EPA received detailed cost datafrom two other scrubber vendors, one of which has served as a subcontractorto the primary vendor in the installation of several of their scrubberson FCCU's, and, therefore, is familiar with FCCU operation, refinery codes,and equipment specifications. The other vendor that supplied cost datahas considerable experience with the design and application of scrubbersto industrial boilers, but not to FCCU's. The analysis of these data showed that the costs provided by the primaryvendor of single alkali scrubbers applied to FCCU's, were the highest ofall the vendor cost estimates and are conservative due to more stringentdesign specifications than other vendors use and the use of redundant equipmentthat serve to provide the scrubber with the reliability that petroleumcompanies believe is necessary in the refining industry. In particular,the primary vendor's system design specifications call for vessel designcoded by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), and designof pumps, piping, and electrical equipment coded by the American PetroleumInstitute (API); one of the other two vendors that provided cost data didnot specify such coded design. Vessels on scrubbers designed by the primaryvendor are larger than those designed by the other two companies, and usespecial refractory linings to protect the steel shell from the abrasiveeffects of catalyst fines in the refinery flue gas. Further, the primaryvendor's design requires sparing of all rotating equipment and criticalanalyzers, and specifies multiple venturis, rather than a single variablethroat venturi as specified by the other vendors. Fluid catalytic crackingunits may be in continuous operation for about 3 years nonstop, or significantlylonger in some cases, and the primary vendor designs their scrubbers tomaintain safe and reliable operation for time periods equal to that ofthe FCCU's the scrubbers control. B. <T3>Review of Specific Cost Comments. </T3>Second, EPA considered the specificcost comments provided by companies. One commenter stated that EPA's costs were low, in part, because of erroneousassumptions of FCCU exhaust gas volumes. The EPA concluded that the exhaustgas volumes used for the cost analysis for FCCU's using HTR are appropriate.Model plant FCCU exhaust gas volumes were developed based on stoichiometricrelationships between the coke composition, the amount of air necessaryto burn the coke, and typical levels of excess air. The calculated exhaustgas volumes were compared to actual exhaust volumes reported for FCCU regeneratorsand were found to be reasonable. Furthermore, the values used for the modelplant regenerator exhaust gas volumes were sent to industry representativesfor review prior to beginning the impact analyses, and no comments werereceived by EPA indicating that the exhaust gas volumes were not representativeof actual conditions. During these cost evaluations, EPA revised the exhaust gas volume for FCCU'soperating with jet ejector venturis (JEV's) to include the flue gas contributionfrom the CO boiler. As a result, EPA also revised the capital and annualcosts for JEV scrubbers installed on FCCU's. Fluid catalytic cracking unitsusing CO boilers must install the JEV-type scrubber. The JEV costs presentedin the proposal BID did not account for the additional flue gas volumethat would enter a JEV scrubber because of the combustion air requiredin the CO boiler. The EPA determined that flue gas volume to a JEV scrubberwould be about 10 percent higher than the volume of gas from an FCCU toa high-energy venturi scrubber. This increased volume resulted in abouta 3-percent increase in the cost of the JEV scrubber over that previouslycalculated. Several commenters stated that EPA used erroneous assumptions for scrubberwaste disposal costs. The EPA, therefore, reviewed the waste disposal costsused in the proposal BID. The cost values used in the proposal BID representthe cost for the transport to and disposal of collected catalyst finesin a landfill. This solid waste disposal cost is based only on the additionalmass of solid wastes to be disposed due to the use of a wet scrubber asthe collection device instead of an ESP. In the proposal BID, no costswere credited to the disposal of the treated liquid wastes because EPAassumed that the treated liquid wastes were disposed to surface water.Upon review, EPA decided that it is appropriate to provide a more conservativeestimate of liquid waste disposal costs by assuming that all affected facilitieswould discharge to sewers. Some refiners, especially in coastal locations,will likely be able to discharge the treated scrubber liquid wastes tosurface waters without incurring a sewer discharge cost.Two commenters questioned EPA's assumptions of off-site costs. Two othercommenters stated that EPA did not consider site space or equipment variability,soil conditions, FCCU turnaround schedule, start up costs, or constructionclimate. The EPA has considered specific costs for off-sites, soil conditions,turnaround schedule, equipment availability, climate, and startup in thecosts estimates. Off-sites include electricity, water, fire protection,steam, compressed air, and other utilities. The scrubber costs used byEPA to evaluate cost impacts include the cost of connecting utilities tothe scrubber provided the utilities are located within the battery limitsof the FCCU. The battery limits refer to that portion of the refinery associatedwith a particular process unit and its supporting equipment. Where utilitiesare not available or insufficient capacity is available within the FCCUbattery limits, the refiner will incur a cost greater than that assumedin the cost estimates. However, a 20-percent contingency is provided ineach capital cost estimate. The EPA considers the site-specific costs relatedto soil conditions, turnaround schedules, site space and equipment availability,climate, startup, and the expense of off-sites to be included in this contingencyand, therefore, to have been considered by EPA. In support of the comments on costs of construction climate, space andequipment availability, and pond and treatment system requirements, onecommenter provided capital costs for the retrofit installation of a sodiumscrubber to control both particulate and SO<T2>X</T2> emissions from an FCCU at an existing refinery. The single alkaliscrubber is sized for a flue gas volumetric flow rate similar to the 8,000m\3\/sd model plant used by EPA in developing costs. A comparison of thecommenter's cost estimate with EPA's revised cost estimate shows that thetotal direct cost for both estimates is about the same. The commenter applieda 60-percent factor to account for indirect costs compared to the 40-percentfactor used by EPA. The commenter also applied to this base cost estimatean additional 27-percent cost adjustment, which included labor productivity,design allowance, and construction climate. The EPA evaluated the commenter'scost factors and believes that these factors are adequately accounted forby EPA's 20-percent contingency cost factor. When adjusted to equivalentdollars, the commenter's cost estimate is approximately 50 percent higherthan EPA's revised cost estimate for a single alkali scrubber of a comparablesize installed on an existing FCCU. The commenter's scrubber costs were developed from a preliminary factor-typecost estimate provided by a vendor. This type of cost estimate is developedin the early stages of a construction project when the project specificationsare not very well defined. A factor-type estimate will typically containseveral generous cost allowances to account for uncertainties in equipmentspecifications and construction. As a project becomes more defined, thefinal cost estimate normally is lower, and closer to the actual cost ofthe project. The EPA's costs are based on a vendor's experience with scrubberapplications to FCCU's, and EPA believes that these costs are more representativeof the actual cost of this scrubber design than the cost estimate providedby the commenter. Thus, the difference between the commenter's cost estimateand EPA's revised costs is largely due to the preliminary nature of thecommenter's cost estimate. One commenter indicated that EPA's cost estimates should more appropriatelybe based on the use of dual alkali flue gas desulfurization systems, becausesingle alkali systems may not be applicable in areas where water availabilityor wastewater discharge is restricted. The commenter provided cost datato show that dual alkali systems are more expensive than single alkalisystems. A dual alkali scrubber consists of two parts, the ``front half''and the ``back half.'' The front half of a dual alkali scrubber resemblesa single alkali scrubber without a wastewater treatment unit and performsthe same function_removing SO<T2>x</T2> from a gas stream by contacting it with a caustic or soda ashscrubbing liquor. In the back half of a dual alkali scrubber, however,the purge is treated to regenerate the scrubbing liquor for reuse; a singlealkali scrubber simply treats and discharges the purged liquor. The EPA agrees that, where direct discharge of scrubber wastewater is notpermitted, dual alkali scrubbers would be a viable alternative to singlealkali scrubbers because dual alkali scrubbers produce a calcium sulfatesludge that would be more readily disposed than wastewater, but disagreesthat dual alkali scrubbing systems would be more expensive than singlealkali. The commenter compared capital costs for dual alkali scrubbers to EPA'sproposed single alkali scrubber costs. The commenter's cost estimates werebased on proprietary actual scrubber cost information provided by the commenter'scontractors. For each of the model plants presented in the proposal BID,a computer cost model was used by the commenter to estimate dual alkaliscrubber costs assuming 90 percent SO<T2>x</T2>. reduction. The commenter's dual alkali scrubber costs are afunction of volumetric gas flow rates and sulfur loading. The commenterscost estimates for dual alkali scrubbing were significantly higher thanEPA's proposal estimates for all dual alkali model units. Because these differences existed, EPA performed a further evaluation ofdual alkali costs based on data from vendors of dual alkali systems. Specifically,costs from the primary vendor of single alkali scrubbers to FCCU's wereused to develop costs for the front half of both sizes of a dual alkaliscrubber. Another vendor provided back half costs for both sizes of dualalkali scrubber. The primary vendor also provided EPA with a cost estimateprovided to them by an independent vendor of dual alkali scrubbers forthe back half of a dual alkali scrubber applied to the 8000 m\3\/sd FCCUonly. The commenter's and EPA's costs are based on a scrubber design thatwould control both FCCU particulate and SO<T2>X</T2> emissions. The EPA's revised capital cost estimates for dual alkali scrubbers aregreater than those in the proposal BID, but less than the capital costestimates for single alkali scrubbers provided by the primary vendor. Thisis because the back half of the dual alkali scrubber, where the purgedscrubbing liquor is treated to regenerate it for reuse, was found to beless costly than the wastewater treatment system needed to treat the purgedscrubbing liquor before discharge from a single alkali system. Constructioncosts for the in-ground ponds specified by the primary vendor for wastewatertreatment are greater than the cost of the dual alkali sludge dewateringand disposal facilities. A comparison of EPA's revised dual alkali costs with those provided bythe commenter shows that the commenter's total dual alkali costs remainedsignificantly higher than EPA's revised dual alkali total cost estimate.However, because the commenter's cost information is based on proprietaryactual cost data developed by contractors of dual alkali scrubbers andprovided to the commenter, detailed cost information was not provided toEPA by the commenter, and a comparison of EPA's individual capital coststo those provided by the commenter was not possible. The EPA's analysis of data supplied by vendors of dual alkali systems indicatesthat total single alkali scrubber costs are more costly than total dualalkali scrubber costs rather than less costly as the commenter believes.Therefore, EPA's current cost estimates for model plants, which reflectthe use of only single alkali scrubbing, represent a conservative estimateof nationwide costs; dual alkali cost estimates applied to the model plantswould only decrease the national costs. Therefore, it was decided not torevise costs of SO<T2>2</T2> control of model plants to reflect the use of dual alkali atsome facilities. This commenter also provided cost data for single alkali systems. The EPAperformed an analysis of this single alkali cost data for comparison tosingle alkali cost estimates in the proposal BID. The commenter's costsfor single alkali scrubber systems are similar to EPA's revised costs forthe low sulfur model plants, but are significantly higher than EPA's revisedcosts for the 1.5 and 3.5 weight percent sulfur model plants. The commenter'ssingle alkali cost estimates assume that single alkali capital costs are93 percent of dual alkali costs. The EPA believes this approach is inappropriatebecause, whereas capital costs for dual alkali systems are a function ofboth waste gas flow rate and feed sulfur content, capital costs for singlealkali systems are a function only of waste gas flow rate. Dual alkalicontrol requires equipment to regenerate the reagent solution, the costof which depends, in part, on the sulfur content of the flue gas. Becausesingle alkali systems do not have such equipment, capital costs of singlealkali control are a function only of waste gas flow rate. Therefore, singlealkali cost estimates derived by applying a constant percentage of dualalkali costs for different sulfur content models would result in erroneousestimates. The EPA believes, therefore, that the accuracy of the commenter'ssingle alkali costs, which increase with feed sulfur content, is doubtful.Two commenters stated that EPA needed to reevaluate the cost of retrofittingexisting FCCU's with scrubbers. The EPA reevaluated these costs. Costsassociated with retrofit will vary widely from one refinery to anotherbased on the refinery configuration and the availability of land. In somecases, space limitations around an existing FCCU may result in relocatingutilities and piping runs, longer ducting runs, and other factors thatmay make scrubber installations more difficult than at a new refinery.Therefore, EPA agrees that retrofit should be included in the cost estimatesfor some model plants. A retrofit cost factor of 20 percent of the scrubbercapital cost (less contingency) was estimated by one commenter. This costwas added to three of the seven modified or reconstructed FCCU's anticipatedto be subject to this standard during the first 5 years after the effectivedate of the standard. One commenter stated that EPA did not consider a cost for business interruptionthat would result from a scrubber malfunction shutting down the FCCU. Althoughsodium scrubbers have demonstrated reliability factors in excess of 95percent, scrubber malfunctions can occur. The General Provisions to 40CFR part 60 states that emissions in excess of an emission limit duringa period of malfunction of a control device are not considered a violationprovided the control device has been properly operated and maintained.During a period of a sudden or unavoidable scrubber failure, the refinerwould still be able to operate the FCCU. Therefore, no business interruptioncost would be incurred. For this reason, EPA did not include a businessinterruption impact when revising the proposal BID costs. One commenter stated that EPA subtracted an ESP cost credit inappropriatelyin the cases of an existing FCCU with an ESP in place if scrubbers arerequired as a result of modification/reconstruction. The EPA agrees thatan ESP cost credit is not appropriate in these cases. The proposal BIDcosts were revised to eliminate the ESP cost credit for the three modifiedor reconstructed FCCU's in which retrofit costs were included. C. <T3>Summary of Cost Changes.</T3> As a result of both the general reevaluationof costs and the review of specific cost comments, EPA revised the capitaland annual cost estimates for FCCU scrubbers. The following changes weremade: (1) Costs of individual components were adjusted based on the datareceived; (2) JEV scrubber costs were revised to account for increasedflue gas volume entering the scrubber as a result of CO boiler combustionair; (3) waste disposal costs were increased to include liquid waste discharges;(4) a cost for retrofit installation was added for the modified or reconstructedFCCU's; and (5) the ESP cost credit was deleted for the three scrubbersthat were installed on modified or reconstructed FCCU's and for which retrofitcosts were included. Costs were then further adjusted to 1984 dollars.After both the general and the specific cost analyses, EPA concluded thatthe proposal BID costs are not understated by a factor of 2.2 to 7. Changesin cost as described above caused nationwide capital costs to increaseby 30 percent (from $72 to $93.6 million); adjusted to 1984 dollars, capitalcosts increased a total of 63 percent from proposal (from $72 to $117 million).Changes in cost caused nationwide annual costs to increase by 5 percent(from $35 to $36.6 million per year); adjusted to 1984 dollars, annualcosts increased a total of 29 percent from proposal (from $35 to $45 millionper year). Thus, these estimates show that the standards would result in a total nationwidecapital cost for SO<T2>X</T2> control for the first 5 years after the effective date of thestandards of $117 million, assuming sodium-based scrubbers are used atall facilities processing feedstocks with sulfur content above 0.3 weightpercent. The fifth year nationwide annual cost is $45 million. Units processingfeedstocks with sulfur contents of 0.3 weight percent would be below thefeed sulfur cutoff and, therefore, would not need to install a scrubber.Where sodium scrubbers are not applicable, dual alkali scrubbers couldbe used at a similar cost to sodium scrubbers. <ITAG tagnum="81">SO</ITAG><T2>X</T2> Reduction Catalysts <T3>Comment (Performance):</T3> Commenters stated that SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalysts are not demonstrated and cannot achieve80 percent reductions in SO<T2>X</T2> emissions. <T3>Response:</T3> The EPA considers SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalysts to be an emerging technology. The standardsallow for their use and thereby encourage their further development. Currentcatalysts show promising results. As described in the ``Level of Standards''section of this preamble, current SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalysts can achieve SO<T2>X</T2> emission reductions of 65 to 75 percent. Additionally, for manyfeed sulfur levels, the standard can be met with less than 80 percent SO<T2>X</T2> emission reduction. <T3>Comment (Solid Waste Impacts):</T3> One commenter stated that, accordingto the preamble, SO reduction catalysts are not expected to have a solidwaste impact. The commenter estimated, however, that the use of SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalysts would increase FCCU solid waste by 11,000Mg/yr. <T3>Response:</T3> The EPA does not believe that the use of SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalysts would result in a significant increase inFCCU solid waste. When used as an additive, SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalysts replace from less than 5 to 10 percent ofthe circulating catalyst inventory. One of the catalyst developers statedthat, due to the softness of their SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalyst (an additive), its makeup rate is greaterthan that for the cracking catalyst. The developer reported that this mayresult in an increase in solid waste of up to 40 percent. Based on recenttests by another developer, solid waste increases of less than 5 percentare anticipated for the newer SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalyst formulations because these are much harderthan earlier formulations. The EPA believes that it would be in the catalystdevelopers' interest to produce a harder reduction catalyst because a harderformulation would have a lower makeup rate and therefore, most likely wouldcost less to use than a softer one. Other recently developed catalyst formulationsincorporate the SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalyst as a constituent of the cracking catalystand consequently, SO<T2>X</T2> control can be accomplished without increasing the total quantityof cracking catalyst used in the FCCU over a period of time. In this case,SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalysts would not increase particulate emissionsor solid waste. In summary, whether the SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalyst is in the form of an additive or a constituentof the cracking catalyst, it is unlikely that the use of newer SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalyst formulations would significantly increaseFCCU solid waste over current levels.<T3>Comment (Air Impacts):</T3> One commenter stated that the preambleto the proposed standards does not adequately address the effect of SO<T2>x</T2> reduction catalysts on NO<T2>x</T2> emissions. The commenter pointed out that the preamble statesthat SO<T2>x</T2> reduction catalysts would not increase NO<T2>x</T2> emissions, while the proposal BID and a docket entry show thatSO<T2>x</T2> reduction catalysts raised NO<T2>x</T2> emissions. <T3>Response:</T3> Most refiners use one of two techniques to control COemissions from the FCCU regenerators: HTR or catalytically promoted COcombustion. Data from some tests of NO<T2>x</T2> emissions from regenerators using both CO combustion promotercatalysts and SO<T2>x</T2> reduction catalysts in combination show an increase in NO<T2>x</T2> emissions. Separate data for regenerators using CO combustionpromoters without SO<T2>x</T2> reduction catalysts suggest that the use of these catalystsmay increase NO<T2>x</T2> emissions. Thus, at this time, it is unclear whether the NO<T2>x</T2> increases observed for SO<T2>x</T2> reduction catalyst tests are due to the reduction catalyst orthe CO combustion promoter. Recent commercial tests of SO<T2>x</T2> reduction catalysts in FCCU's utilizing HTR show no increasein NO<T2>x</T2> emissions. No recent tests of SO<T2>x</T2> reduction catalysts in FCCU's utilizing CO promoters were available.Because most FCCU's subject to the standards are expected to use HTR andbecause newer SO<T2>x</T2> reduction catalyst formulations have not increased NO<T2>x</T2> emissions, EPA believes that the use of the SO<T2>x</T2> reduction catalyst technology will not increase NO<T2>x</T2> emissions. <T3>Comment (Costs):</T3> Three commenters wrote that in certain circumstancesthe SO<T2>x</T2> reduction catalyst technology requires a capital outlay. Thecircumstances identified by the commenters were: (1) Because SO<T2>x</T2> reduction catalysts can only be used in units with HTR, olderunits subject to the standards under the modification or reconstructionprovisions that do not or cannot operate in this mode will be requiredto convert or modify units; (2) small refineries that do not have sulfurrecovery units; and (3) refineries with inadequate sulfur recovery unitcapacities to handle the increased sulfur load due to the SO<T2>x</T2> reduction catalyst technology. In addition, two commenters statedthat annual costs for SO<T2>x</T2> reduction catalysts will likely be at least 2 times higher thanEPA's estimate. <T3>Response:</T3> Many refiners have modified their older FCCU's to HTR;HTR offers advantages over conventional regeneration (e.g., reduced SO<T2>x</T2> emissions, improved yields, and increased throughput). It isunlikely that an older FCCU would become subject to these standards throughthe modification/reconstruction provisions without modifying the unit toHTR. A refiner is more likely to use SO<T2>x</T2> reduction catalysts in an FCCU modified for HTR than to modifyan FCCU solely to use SO<T2>x</T2> reduction catalysts. If an FCCU subject to these standards cannotutilize SO<T2>x</T2> reduction catalysts, the refiner is more likely to select anothercontrol technique than incur a $10-20 million capital expenditure. Use of SO<T2>x</T2> reduction catalysts will increase the amount of hydrogen sulfide(H<T2>2</T2>S) in refinery fuel gas, which is removed from the fuel gas ina sulfur recovery unit. The increase in the amount of H<T2>2</T2>S to a sulfur recovery unit is only about 5 to 10 percent. Sulfurrecovery units generally are overdesigned by much more than this to accountfor swings or surges in H<T2>2</T2>S production from refinery process units. It is doubtful thatthe use of SO<T2>x</T2> reduction catalysts alone would overload a sulfur recovery unit.The EPA contacted companies developing or licensing SO<T2>x</T2> reduction catalysts to obtain current costs for commerciallyavailable SO<T2>x</T2> reduction catalysts. Catalyst developers reported costs forthe technology ranging from $0.60 to $1.60 per cubic meter of fresh feedprocessed. The fifth year cost for SO<T2>x</T2> reduction catalysts was then calculated by multiplying the costfactors provided by the catalyst developers by the total fifth year annualthroughput for all affected facilities processing feedstocks containinggreater than 0.30 weight percent sulfur. The new fifth year cost for SO<T2>x</T2> reduction catalysts ranges from $20 million to $50 million.Costs for SO<T2>x</T2> reduction catalyst are presented as a range because the technologyis under development. The upper end of the range represents a newer catalystformulation; the developer of this catalyst expects the cost to decreaseas the catalyst formulation is produced in greater quantities. <ITAG tagnum="81">Economic Impacts </ITAG><T3>Comment:</T3> Several commenters stated that the proposed standardswould have an adverse effect on the refining industry and the nation'seconomy. Four commenters wrote that the compliance costs are sufficientlyhigh to require the preparation of a Regulatory Impact Analysis under ExecutiveOrder 12291. One commenter wrote that current prices will reduce the attractivenessof FCCU modifications to the point where the additional cost of a scrubberor other SO<T2>x</T2> control device would not be feasible. Three commenters wrotethat the costs of the proposed standards would, in some cases, postponenew investments and would cause a significant economic impact on the profitabilityof FCCU operation and the construction of new FCCU's. <T3>Response:</T3> The cost analysis presented in the proposal BID wasreviewed under Executive Order 12291 by the Office of Management and Budget(OMB). Since that time, in response to comments, EPA has revised thesecosts upward. With these revisions, the fifth year nationwide annualizedcosts are still below the $100 million level that triggers a regulatoryimpact analysis under Executive Order 12291. The price increases publishedin the proposal BID were all less than 0.4 percent. Using the revised controlcosts and second quarter 1984 product prices, that figure increases toapproximately 0.8 percent for the worst case considered (3.5 weight percentsulfur feedstock). The EPA still considers this to be acceptable. The capital required for the control devices will increase the investmentfor a new FCCU by 9 percent for the 8,000 m\3\/sd unit and by 15 percentfor the 2,500 m\3\/sd unit. The EPA does not consider these percentagessufficiently high to deter a decision to install an FCCU that is otherwiseeconomically justified. Compliance Testing and Monitoring <ITAG tagnum="81">General </ITAG><T3>Comment:</T3> Two commenters pointed out that as proposed SO<T2>x</T2> testing would be conducted upstream of the CO incinerator whilevelocity and volumetric flow rates would be determined downstream of theCO incinerator. One commenter pointed out that the regulation indicatesthat sampling for SO<T2>x</T2> concentration ``shall be the same as for determining volumetricflow rate;'' the commenter believed the regulation statement is correct.One commenter stated that it is unsafe to require personnel to conductmanual sampling due to the high flue gas temperatures at this location(650-769 anddegrees;C) and that sampling at extreme temperatures is impracticaldue to frequent sampling train operating problems and rapid sample probefailures. <T3>Response:</T3> The EPA agrees that SO<T2>x</T2> testing should be performed at the same location as the volumetricflow rate measurement, as is specified in the regulation. The EPA recognizes the commenter's concern regarding safety. Sampling eitherupstream or downstream from the CO boiler is acceptable for the standardwithout add-on controls. However, if the owner or operator chooses to testdownstream of the CO boiler, alternative calculation procedures for determiningthe coke burn-off rate and the SO<T2>x</T2> contribution due to the auxiliary fuel burned in the boilermust be submitted to and approved by the Administrator. In addition, therecommended location for the inlet CEMS has been changed to downstreamof the CO boiler for the standard with add-on controls. <ITAG tagnum="81">Add-On Control Devices </ITAG><T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter stated that an operator of an add-on controldevice should be given the flexibility to choose between the original proposal,which would have required using an outlet monitor only, and the operationof a CEMS in which both an inlet and outlet monitor are used. Another commenter stated that after the compliance test, the proposed standardsonly need an ``alerting service,'' which could be provided by an outletmonitor alone. <T3>Response:</T3> The standard for FCCU's using add-on controls is 90percent reduction or 50 vppm, whichever is less stringent. The intent ofmonitoring for the standard for add-on controls is to determine complianceon a daily basis, as described in the revised proposal. To meet this intent,the Agency needs data that show the actual compliance status of the source,not data that simply alert the Agency to potential problems. To make anaccurate determination of compliance with the 90 percent reduction standard,the Agency must have both scrubber inlet and outlet data. Even where feedsulfur is not ``highly'' variable, the outlet concentration may vary dueto FCCU operation or the source of the feed, while scrubber performancemay stay constant. Therefore, measuring only the outlet emissions may leadto an incorrect compliance determination for the percent reduction standard.The Agency recognizes, however, that an inlet monitor is unnecessary formaking continuous compliance determinations in relation to the 50 vppmstandard for add-on controls. Thus, the Agency has modified the regulationso that owners or operators may choose to declare their intent to meetthe standard for add-on controls by limiting their outlet SO<T2>2</T2> emissions to 50 vppm and install a CEMS at only the outlet ofthe control device to determine compliance. The Agency wishes to pointout that, for such owners or operators, compliance determinations willbe made only on the basis of the outlet SO<T2>2</T2> emissions without regard for the percent reduction being achievedby the control device. Such owners or operators may change their choiceso they would be subject to the whole standard on ``90 percent reductionor 50 vppm, whichever is less stringent,'' provided a CEMS is installedand maintained at the inlet of the control device as well as the outlet.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter felt that because an add-on control deviceachieves greater reductions in SO<T2>2</T2> emissions than technologies meeting the standard without add-oncontrols, ``less drastic'' compliance monitoring requirements for scrubbersare reasonable. This commenter proposed that compliance be determined insteadby an initial performance test, quarterly monitoring of inlet and outletSO<T2>X</T2> concentration using EPA Reference Method 6 or 6B, and continuousmonitoring of wet gas scrubber process variables, such as pH, liquid-to-gasratios, and pressure drop, to evaluate scrubber performance in an ongoingbasis. <T3>Response: </T3>Monitoring and testing requirements are chosen to beappropriate for the control technique and to meet the intent or goal ofthe monitoring and testing. The relative stringency of different controltechniques has no bearing on the selection of the most appropriate monitoringor testing requirement for each control technique. The purpose of monitoring for these standards is determining complianceon a daily basis. The procedure suggested by the commenter does not giveinformation from which the compliance status can be determined daily. <T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters stated that continuous SO<T2>2</T2> monitors are unreliable due to monitor operational problems.One commenter proposed that the requirement for continuous monitoring ofthe inlet and outlet to add-on controls be eliminated, while another commenterrecommended an increased allowance for CEMS downtime and maintenance, suchas requiring data for 15 days per month instead of 22, and 12 hours perday instead of 18. One commenter stated that, to his knowledge, EPA doesnot have CEMS data showing that the device can run 24 hours per day forone full month and give accurate results. He also asked about the frequencyof manual emission testing that would be required when the CEMS fails.<T3>Response: </T3>The EPA extensively studied the reliability of SO<T2>2</T2> and diluent CEMS during the development of subpart D, subpartDa, and appendix F of 40 CFR part 60. Current studies show that state-of-the-artmonitoring systems provide precise and accurate data when proper operationand maintenance techniques are employed on a continuous basis. Experiencehas shown that approximately 2 hours per day of manual attention is necessaryto obtain an 85 percent or greater availability. Further, as discussedin the BID for the proposed standards, Appendix D, FCCU catalyst regeneratorexhausts are similar to those of coal-fired steam generators; therefore,the continuous SO<T2>2</T2> monitoring technology proven acceptable for steam generatorsshould be applicable to FCCU catalyst regenerators. The SO<T2>2</T2> monitors have been installed on some FCCU catalyst regenerators;EPA has gathered information on the operational history of some of theseCEMS but the data were insufficient to compare directly to appendix F to40 CFR part 60, which contains quality assurance procedures for CEMS usedfor compliance determinations. The Agency has, for example, conducted tests at a sodium scrubber on anFCCU using inlet and outlet SO<T2>2</T2> CEMS. The outlet monitor was on a saturated gas stream withoutreheat of the flue gas. There was no particulate removal in the flue gasprior to the inlet monitor. The duration of the testing was about 12 days.Over this time, no difficulty was experienced in obtaining valid data.Some regular backflushing of the outlet analyzer system occurred due tothe saturated nature of the flue gas. This limited time testing suggeststhat with careful maintenance of the monitors, long term use and potentialproblems can be avoided. The difficulty stated with regard to outlet monitorson a saturated gas stream can be overcome through adequate design and maintenanceof the CEMS. (The commenter does not state that the difficulty cannot beovercome, but rather just that it is difficult.) A particular concern of several commenters was particulate plugging. TheAgency does not agree that particulate plugging will be a problem if themonitor is properly designed and operated. In-stack filters have been redesignedwith better shields, and improved outsidestack conditioning systems havebeen developed that allow removal of the in-stack filter, when necessary.Furthermore, technologies are available to circumvent CEMS plugging. Properlydesigned systems usually have back-purge capabilities to prevent particulateplugging of the sampling probe in the stack. Studies have also shown thathigh pressure (greater than 70 psi) air in backflushing sample lines andprobes improves removal of particulate and moisture from the in-stack probesand filters both upstream and downstream of scrubbers. Manufacturers ofthe systems and installation personnel would be responsible for designingeach system for a specific source. Based on these studies, EPA has concluded that continuous SO<T2>2</T2> monitors are reliable and accurate when properly operated andmaintained, and are capable of meeting the minimum requirements for determiningcompliance with these standards. Thus, the promulgated standards retainthe requirement for continuous SO<T2>2</T2> monitors. The EPA does not expect the CEMS to run nonstop for 24 hours per day foran entire month. To allow for periods when CEM's are shut down for variousreasons, minimum data requirements were established. The EPA based itsselection of 18 hours of data in a 24-hour day and 22 days of data outof 30 days on the minimum data requirements for compliance determinationsspecified for utility boilers under subpart Da of 40 CFR part 60. Underthese standards, EPA concluded that the required data to be collected providedsufficient information to characterize emissions, and that properly operatedand maintained CEMS's were capable of meeting these requirements. The operatingconditions at the upstream CEMS at FCCU's are similar to those found ata subpart Da boiler CEMS prior to the flue gas scrubber. The minimum datarequirements (i.e., collection of 18 valid hours of data per day for 22days out of every 30) provide for downtime enabling the owner or operatorto maintain and calibrate the CEMS and correct minor malfunctions. Manual testing is not required when the CEMS fails provided the facilitymeets the minimum data requirements. Malfunctions are not likely to occurevery 30-day period. Thus, EPA expects that most CEMS's routinely willoperate better than the minimum data requirements and supplemental samplingwill be rarely necessary to meet them. Many methods are available for supplemental sampling; each owner or operatorwould develop an approach to obtaining these minimum data in the QualityControl Plan required by Procedure 1 of 40 CFR part 60 appendix F. Anyacceptable sampling scheme would have to obtain data representing at least18 hours of operation daily. If Method 6 is used, the minimum samplingtime is 20 minutes and the minimum sampling volume is 0.02 dry standardcubic meters (dscm) (0.71 dry standard cubic feet (dscf)) for each sample.Samples are taken at approximately 60-minute intervals; each sample representsa 1-hour average. To obtain one valid day from supplemental sampling requires18 valid samples. Method 6B, if used, would also have to collect a samplerepresenting a minimum of 18 hours. If a back-up monitor is used instead,then a minimum of 18 valid hours to obtain a valid day is still required.<T3>Comment: </T3>Two commenters questioned the costs of CEMS's reportedby EPA. One commenter asked whether the sample collecting and conditioningsystems needed to ensure a reliable CEMS were included in the price ofthe CEMS and whether the Agency updated the costs from the original proposal.The other commenter felt the Agency substantially underestimated the costsof a CEMS. <T3>Response: </T3>The cost of the additional CEMS reported in the revisedproposal notice reflected the cost of an extractive analyzer and installation(in February 1981 dollars). The Agency updated the original 1981 costsfor the extractive analyzer system and obtained a revised fourth quarter1984 cost estimate of $69,300 (including installation and data acquisitionsystem (DAS); $46,200 without the DAS). The Agency also recently attempted to obtain updated CEMS cost data bycontacting vendors and source owners or operators using CEMS. The studyfound total worst-case costs for an extractive analyzer (including a DASand installation) to be from $45,000 to $180,000 (1984 dollars). (The worst-casecosts included additional costs for longer sample lines, corrosion-resistantprobes, probe back-flush systems, and computer data acquisition systemscapable of generating emissions reports.) The commenter provides an estimateof about $100,000 (analyzer, sampling system, and installation). Takingout the cost of a DAS (about $23,000) from the worst-case costs, the commenter'sestimate falls in the middle-to-upper end of the worst-case costs. TheAgency notes that its original cost estimate for an extractive analyzer,when updated to 1984 dollars, still falls within the worst-case costs rangereported in the updated study. Updating the across-the-stack cost estimate, which was for a complete outletmonitoring system, to fourth quarter 1984 dollars yields a cost estimateof about $92,900 for the analyzer, DAS, and installation. Data on across-the-stackCEMS gathered more recently show total worst-case vendor costs withouta DAS from $22,000 to $152,000 (1984 dollars). The one commenter estimatedcosts of about $150,000 to $175,000 per analyzer (analyzer, sampling, andinstallation), which falls at the upper range of the worst-case vendorestimates. The annual maintenance costs estimated by the Agency in the proposal BIDappendix D were $11,000 for either an extractive or across-the-stack CEMS.Updating the cost results in an estimate similar to the commenter's estimateof $16,000 for an extractive system and is more conservative than the commenter'sestimate for an across-the-stack system. <ITAG tagnum="81">Without Add-On Control Devices </ITAG><T3>Comment: </T3>Several commenters stated that EPA had underestimatedthe costs of daily Method 8 testing. Commenters estimates ranged from $184,000to $400,000/yr per FCCU. Commenters did not think it was reasonable toclaim the costs to be ``reasonable'' when the costs are based, in part,on a traversing system not yet developed. One commenter believed that insufficientqualified contractor manpower exists to conduct the Method 8 compliancesampling. <T3>Response: </T3>The EPA agrees with the commenters that the assumptionof an automatic traversing system should not be used for evaluating andrecommending daily Method 8 testing, although the Agency still contendsthat it is technologically feasible. Instead, the Agency has revised thecost estimate assuming that a monorail system will be installed at eachof the two sampling ports and that a single sampling train will be used,with manual movement of the sampling train for traversing and changingports. Although not addressed by the commenters, EPA decided that it wasappropriate to also include a cost for an enclosed sampling area to protectthe sampler and equipment from various weather conditions, such as rainand snow. The capital cost of the monorail system and enclosure is estimatedto be $20,000. When the Agency originally estimated the cost using an automatedtraversing system, two sampling trains were assumed, one in each port.With the revised assumptions, only one sampling train is used, and is movedfrom one port to the next. The standard requires one 3-hour sample perday, 365 days per year; this halves the number of samples to be analyzedto 365 (1 per day). The EPA disagrees with the commenters' claim that three or more peoplewould be devoted full-time to this stack testing. Only one 3-hour sampleis required each day. The Agency believes that it would take an averageof 8 labor hours per day to prepare the equipment, conduct the sampling,and perform periodic maintenance on spare equipment, with added labor foranalysis of about 1.3 hours per sample. The revised annualized cost peraffected facility is estimated to be $120,000. The EPA assumed that in-house personnel would be used to conduct the Method8 compliance sampling. The EPA believes there is sufficient lead time totrain such personnel without requiring or solely relying on contractormanpower. <T3>Comment: </T3>Many commenters stated that daily testing should be deletedfrom the standard for FCCU's without add-on controls. The commenters feltthat daily testing was too costly and unduly burdensome, especially, accordingto one commenter, when compared to the costs of monitoring for the scrubberor testing under the feed sulfur cutoff. One commenter stated that thecost of daily Method 8 testing could hamper improvements in SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalyst development. <T3>Response: </T3>The Agency recognizes that daily testing with Method8 is not inexpensive, but that it is also not an unreasonable cost. TheAgency has examined various methods available to show daily compliancewith the standards. For facilities that opt to use SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalysts to meet the standards, the Agency has determinedthat daily Method 8 testing is currently the only viable alternative thatenables the Agency to be sure that the owner or operator is in complianceon a daily basis. The relative costs of the various methods for determining continuous complianceavailable to all affected facilities subject to the standards is not avalid basis for rejecting one method or another. What is relevant is whetherthe total (capital, annual, monitoring, etc.) cost of compliance for meetingthe standards for an affected facility is reasonable or unreasonable. Dailytesting is needed for this standard in order to show dailv compliance,and the cost of such testing, in the Agency's assessment, is reasonable.The Agency disagrees that daily testing is too costly and unduly burdensome.The Agency studied the potential economic impact of the standards on smalland large refineries and reported and discussed the findings in the originalproposal notice to these standards (49 FR 2072). The economic impact tothe small (and large) refiner is expected to be small because most, ifnot all, of the cost should be capable of being included in the pricesof the refined petroleum products and the resulting price impact is reasonable.These results were obtained assuming compliance by all projected affectedfacilities with the standard for FCCU's with add-on controls, which ismore expensive than compliance with the standard for FCCU's without add-oncontrols. Therefore, the economic impacts of complying with the standardfor FCCU's without add-on controls will be smaller. The Agency believes that the monitoring costs associated with daily Method8 testing are unlikely to affect SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalyst development. Even with the higher testingcosts, SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalysts are still likely to be overall less costlyto use than scrubbers. Thus, development on SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalysts will still continue as owners or operatorstry to minimize their costs in meeting these standards. In conclusion, the Agency believes that the cost of daily Method 8 testingis reasonable in order to ensure daily compliance. Less expensive methodsthat allow the Agency to make equivalently accurate daily compliance determinationsare encouraged and may be used subject to the approval of the Administrator.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter stated that the proposed regulation doesnot supply sufficient information (calculation procedures) under Section60.106, ``Test Methods and Procedures,'' to determine total SO<T2>X</T2> emissions. <T3>Response: </T3>The EPA agrees with the commenter. Therefore, the regulationhas been revised to indicate that modification to the calculation proceduresspecified in Reference Method 8 will be required to calculate total SO<T2>X</T2> emissions as SO<T2>2</T2>.<T3>Comment:</T3> Many commenters suggested alternatives to daily Method8 testing for demonstrating continuous compliance. The commenters suggestedthree basic types of alternatives: (1) The use of less frequent Method8 testing, (2) periodic testing for SO<T2>X</T2> until an SO<T2>3</T2> CEMS is developed, and (3) the use of continuous SO<T2>2</T2> monitors with periodic testing for SO<T2>3</T2>. One commenter stated, in general, that the daily applicationof Method 8 is cumbersome, and thus, the proposed rule should contain provisionsto allow the permittee to demonstrate continuous compliance based on abroader spectrum of options. <T3>Response:</T3> The Agency has considered the alternatives suggestedby the commenters. The Agency agrees that any test should not be performedmore frequently than necessary and that a history of test data may showthat daily testing is unnecessary. However, such a ``history of test data''does not exist at this time and without such data, the Agency does notbelieve any of the alternative monitoring or testing schemes suggestedcan be implemented at this time and ensure that accurate continuous compliancedeterminations are made. Further, the commenters provided very little datato support their arguments, and available data show that the SO<T2>3</T2>/SO<T2>X</T2> ratio can be variable. One of the commenters provided literature on an SO<T2>2</T2> monitor that they thought should be able to monitor SO<T2>3</T2> also. The information and literature provided were insufficientfor the Agency to evaluate this potential for this particular monitor.The Agency has examined other monitors for their ability to monitor SO<T2>X</T2>. To date, none of the monitors examined has proven suitable.Therefore, the Agency could not require at this time such a monitor. TheAgency does agree that many of these alternatives may be shown acceptableas more data on SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalyst use and SO<T2>X</T2> emissions are generated. Therefore, the standard explicitlystates that such alternatives supported by sufficient data may be approvedon a case-by-case basis. Some of the criteria that may be considered arethe SO<T2>3</T2>/SO<T2>X</T2> ratio, product feed variability, frequency of product slatechanges, operational variability in regenerator conditions (e.g., excessoxygen, temperature), catalyst addition schedules, and FCCU operating conditions.The development of a successful SO<T2>X</T2> monitor would also be an acceptable alternative, upon approvalby the Administrator, to Method 8 testing. In the meantime, however, theAgency has retained daily Method 8 testing for determining compliance ona continuous basis for the standard for FCCU's without add-on controls.<T3>Comment:</T3> Two commenters expressed concern over the possible interferingeffects of particulates when performing Method 8 or revised Method 8. <T3>Response:</T3> The EPA agrees that the presence of ``other particulatematter'' could invalidate the Method 8 test results. Therefore, appropriatechanges have been made in the regulation to permit the insertion of a heatedfilter and probe in the sampling train, prior to the impingers. The heatedprobe and filter will prevent the particulate matter from getting intothe impinger solution. Filters would be required that are at least 99.95percent efficient, as required in Section 3.1.1 of Method 5. There is noindication or reason to suspect these filters would not eliminate the analysisproblem. If analytical interference because of particulate matter stillexists, then alternative analytical techniques (for example, ion chromatography)are available for use upon approval by the Administrator. The Agency has not conducted testing of Method 8 as modified under thesestandards to specifically address the commenter's concerns. The Agencyknows of no technical reason, however, as to why the modifications to Method8 under this subpart would adversely affect the repeatability, reproducibility,precision, or accuracy of Method 8. In addition, EPA is currently developingtest procedures for minimizing the sulfate interference in particulatematter measurements. The alternative of measuring both particulate matterand SO<T2>X</T2> with the same equipment and analytical techniques will be addressedat that time. The EPA acknowledges that ammonia has known interfering effects on SO<T2>X</T2> determinations. We believe there are alternative techniquesto eliminate the interference and are currently studying potential interferenceproblems with respect to ammonia. Thus, in cases where ammonia and/or aminesare expected or are known to create problems, the owner or operator shouldconsult the Administrator for approval of alternative test methods. <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter stated that the collection of a grab sampleusing Reference Method 8 is less reliable than a continuous on-line analyzer,even though there could be some minor variation in the SO<T2>3</T2> to SO<T2>2</T2> ratio in the stack gas. The commenter believed the use of Method8 could give unrealistic results where an unscrupulous operator could adjustthe operating conditions prior to obtaining the daily sample. <T3>Response:</T3> The revised proposed standards specified that the measurementof SO<T2>X</T2> emissions from FCCU's using SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalysts would be accomplished by conducting revisedMethod 8 for one shift each day. The Agency knows of no evidence that thevariation in total SO<T2>X</T2> through the course of a day is any greater than the variationin the SO<T2>2</T2> to SO<T2>3</T2> ratio in the stack gas and, thus, knows of no evidence for thecommenter's remarks. The EPA assumes that operators will obtain valid samples that are representativeof operating conditions at the facility and, therefore, will not alteroperating conditions prior to sampling. Such deliberate actions on thepart of an owner or operator to obtain unrealistic results clearly constitutecircumvention of the standard and are illegal under subpart A, the GeneralProvisions (40 CFR 60.12). Inspection of plant operating data by EPA andState personnel would lead to detection of such alteration of plant operation.<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter questioned whether 160 anddegrees;C (320anddegrees;F) is the appropriate temperature for the heated probe and filterin the revised Method 8. This commenter also asked how the 160 anddegrees;C(320 anddegrees;F) temperature at the probe is reached if the stack temperatureis hotter, or if it is colder. This commenter stated that if a ``probecatch'' is a deposit in the probe, the probe would soon plug up. <T3>Response:</T3> The EPA based the selection of the temperature for theheated filter and probe in the revised Method 8 on the temperature specifiedin the proposed Method 5B and 5F (50 FR 21863, May 29, 1985), which arethe methods for sampling particulate matter at FCCU's. The dew point forSO<T2>3</T2> may be higher than the temperature of the heated filter andprobe (160 anddegrees;C). In such instances, the filter would pick up condensedSO<T2>3</T2> (most likely, though, as sulfuric acid mist), thereby leadingto a low estimate of SO<T2>3</T2> as measured in the impingers. The Agency believes that thisproblem is small because the filter would pick up only a small part ofthe sulfuric acid mist, and the rest would pass through the filter andbe collected in the impingers. Thus, the Agency recognizes that, in suchsituations, a potential bias exists to underestimate emissions, but believesthat it is small provided a temperature of 160 anddegrees;C is maintained.The materials used (glass and stainless steel) in the probes and filterholders are not subject to corrosion from sulfuric acid. Further, the probesand filter holder are removed each day (after the 3-hour test) for cleaning.In addition, FCCU operators would be required to conduct periodic leakchecks. If leaks are detected in the system, or if the sampling systemfails, then the system would need to be repaired. With regard to the stack temperature being different from the probe temperature,if the stack temperature is hotter, there is no problem from an SO<T2>X</T2> enforcement standpoint_more SO<T2>X</T2> will be trapped in the impingers_and, thus, no temperature adjustmenthas to be made at the probe. However, if the stack temperature is colder,less SO<T2>X</T2> will pass through the filter and a temperature adjustment hasto be made. It is common practice to electrically heat the probe to attainthe desired temperature. Finally, with regard to plugging of the probe, as part of normal operatingprocedures, sampling conducted using revised Method 8 requires that theprobe be cleaned out after each run and that the collected sample be discardedfrom the analysis. This procedure eliminates the potential problem broughtup by the commenter. <T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter asked why the isopropanol (IPA) impingerwas deleted from Method 8.<T3>Response:</T3> Method 8 was designed primarily for the separate captureand measurement of sulfuric acid and SO<T2>2</T2>. The IPA impinger is used to collect sulfuric acid and SO<T2>3</T2>, while the hydrogen peroxide impinger is used to collect SO<T2>2</T2>. In the absence of the IPA impinger, the hydrogen peroxide impingerwill collect all the SO<T2>X</T2> compounds together. The current standards for SO<T2>X</T2> reduction catalysts are based on total SO<T2>X</T2>; there is no need to separate SO<T2>2</T2> from other sulfur emissions. Therefore, EPA eliminated the IPAimpinger from Method 8, the effect of which is to simplify the test procedure,analysis, and calculations. <ITAG tagnum="81">Feed Sulphur Cutoff </ITAG><T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter felt that the cost of testing the feedsulfur at FCCU's using the alternative feed sulfur cutoff is too expensiveto be performed more often than is necessary and suggested that such testingshould be required once per week if the feed is previously found to containbelow 0.3 percent sulfur in every sample for a week. <T3>Response: </T3>For these standards, owners and operators are requiredto determine compliance on a continuous basis (i.e., on a daily basis).As described in the proposed standards, most refiners manually sample theFCCU fresh feed once per day. Fresh feed sulfur content, however, may changeon an hourly basis. Requiring samples to be collected once per hour isnot practical using manual sampling techniques. Therefore, the Agency selecteda sampling frequency of one sample per 8-hour shift. This frequency wouldmeasure major fluctuations in fresh feed sulfur level and is reasonableconsidering current refinery sampling practices. The sampling program suggestedby the commenter would not allow the Agency to be sure that the owner oroperator is in fact meeting the standard on a daily basis. Furthermore,past feed usage is not a good indicator of future use; many refiners usedifferent feeds or feed blends for short periods of time. Therefore, theAgency has retained daily testing for feed sulfur content for those operatorsusing this alternative standard. Compliance <ITAG tagnum="81">Source Operation During Malfunctions </ITAG><T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter requested that EPA consider establishingstandards that allow a certain amount of scrubber downtime without requiringan FCCU shutdown. <T3>Response: </T3>The General Provisions in 40 CFR part 60 provide formalfunction of control equipment. ``Malfunction'' means only sudden andunavoidable failure of air pollution control equipment, process equipment,or of a process to operate in a normal or usual manner. Failures that arecaused entirely or in part by poor maintenance, careless operation, orany other preventable upset condition, are not considered malfunctions.As stated in andSection; 60.8(c), emissions in excess of a standard due toa malfunction do not represent a violation of the standard. In addition,scrubbers currently applied to FCCU's have demonstrated reliability levelsin excess of 95 percent. Thus, it is unnecessary to provide a provisionin the standards for scrubber downtime. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter asked if the affected facility is allowedto continue operating during continuous emission monitor malfunctions.<T3>Response: </T3>An affected facility may continue to operate duringcontinuous emission monitor malfunctions. However, as prescribed under40 CFR 60.7(b) and (c)(3) of the General Provisions, the owner or operatorshall maintain records of any periods during which a continuous monitoringsystem or monitoring device is inoperative, and the quarterly (or semiannual,if no exceedances have occurred during a particular quarter) compliancereport shall include the date and time identifying each period during whichthe continuous monitoring system was inoperative, except for zero and spanchecks, and the nature of the system repairs or adjustments. It shouldbe noted that failure to properly operate or maintain a continuous monitoringsystem would be considered as a violation rather than a malfunction (see40 CFR 60.105 and 60.13). <ITAG tagnum="81">Changing Compliance Method </ITAG><T3>Comment: </T3>Four commenters wrote that the 90-day notification priorto changing from one method of compliance to another should be modifiedto allow for an immediate change in emergency cases. Two of these commentersstated that no prior notification should be required provided that recordsappropriate to demonstrate compliance are maintained, and EPA is notifiedin writing of the change in compliance method. <T3>Response: </T3>The regulation now requires that daily compliance determinationsbe made for all of the standards. Thus, EPA agrees with the commentersand has removed the requirements for prior notification provided that recordsappropriate to demonstrate compliance with the regulation are maintained.Additionally, a quarterly report with notification of the change must besubmitted to the Administrator in the quarter following such a change evenif no violations of a standard have occurred. Modification/Reconstruction <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter stated that routine maintenance items shouldnot be included in determining if a facility is modified or reconstructedbecause many of these items are frequently repaired without a resultantemissions increase. Another commenter stated that the affected facilityshould be redefined to include the fractionator and gas plant because rebuildingwork in a single turnaround of an affected facility can commonly exceed50 percent of the cost of a new unit. Also, the cost of rebuilding workon an affected facility can represent 20 percent of the new unit cost ofan entire FCCU. To a refiner, an entire FCCU includes the fractionatorand gas plant. These two units usually do not require any significant rebuilding.<T3>Response: </T3>The reconstruction provision (40 CFR 60.15) cannot beinvoked until 50 percent of the ``fixed capital cost'' to replace the existingfacility with a comparable, new facility has been incurred by the owneror operator. The period in which the FCCU is shut down for maintenanceand repair is called a turnaround. During a typical turnaround, regeneratorrefractory linings, cyclones, and other internal components are inspectedand repaired or replaced as required. Based on information from the refiningindustry, regenerator components have a useful life ranging from 10 yearsto an indefinite period of time when they are repaired and maintained duringturnarounds. The costs used in the summation to determine the total fixedcapital cost incurred are those costs incurred to replace components. Thecosts incurred during maintenance and repair of the existing facility'scomponents (assuming components are not replaced) are not included in thesummation of expended fixed capital costs. Thus, there is no need to specificallyexempt routine maintenance items from the reconstruction provisions. The EPA disagrees with the comment that rebuilding work typically can exceed50 percent of the capital cost of a new affected facility. The EPA examineddata from section 114 letter responses, trip reports, literature articles,and companies who provide turnaround services to refineries. These dataled EPA to conclude that routine rebuilding is less than 50 percent ofthe cost of a new affected facility. As discussed above, this is becauseregenerator components are typically repaired rather than replaced duringa turnaround. If several major changes, such as increasing the FCCU capacity,changing to a heavier or more sour crude oil, or converting to HTR, occurduring a single turnaround, the cost may approach or surpass the 50 percentpoint. Such major changes are not, however, a typical turnaround occurrence.The possibility that rebuilding work may exceed 50 percent of the costof a new unit is an inadequate reason to broaden the definition of theaffected facility (i.e., restrict invoking the reconstruction provision).The modification provision (40 CFR 60.14) is invoked when any physicalor operational change to an existing facility results in an increase inthe emission rate to the atmosphere of any pollutant to which a standardapplies. As the actions described by the commenter do not increase emissions,the modification provision would not be invoked. In addition, paragraph(f) of andSection; 60.14 specifies that routine maintenance, repair, andreplacement by themselves, shall not be considered modifications. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter stated that a 1-calendar year or a 12-month``inclusion period'' for reconstruction is more logical than a 2-year period.A refiner with a normal 2-year turnaround could be affected by the reconstructionprovisions of the standards if a shutdown began 1 or 2 months prematurely.A refiner would not install a sizeable process modification during a routineshutdown period due to the excessive downtime incurred. <T3>Response: </T3>The EPA considered again the 2-year period and concludedthat a 1-calendar year or a 12-month ``inclusion period'' for reconstructionis not more logical than a 2-year period for FCCU's. Information from industryand literature (see proposal BID, p. 5-3) indicates that the normal turnaroundschedule for revamping FCCU regenerators is every 3 years (i.e., a maximumof one turnaround would occur during each 2-year period of operation).A process unit turnaround typically includes maintenance and repair itemsthat do not qualify as fixed capital costs and therefore, a turnaroundis not likely to be a ``reconstruction.'' The Agency also does not expectthat the 2-year period will alter decisions by an FCCU's owner or operatoron when to replace equipment; that is, the FCCU owner or operator is notlikely to prolong the useful life of the regenerator components with theintent of avoiding the NSPS. Therefore, for this particular NSPS, EPA believesthat the 2-year period provides a reasonable, objective method of determiningwhether an owner or operator of an FCCU regenerator is actually ``proposing''extensive component replacement, within the original intent of andSection;60.15.Recordkeeping and Reporting <T3>Comment:</T3> The OMB commented that quarterly reporting was too frequent,and that semiannual reporting would allow the Agency to obtain the necessaryinformation. <T3>Response:</T3> For FCCU's, EPA has concluded that quarterly reporting(or semiannual reporting if no exceedances have occurred during a particularquarter) is the appropriate reporting frequency for the following reasons.The major reason is that the reports contain direct compliance informationrather than indicators of the source's performance. Therefore, enforcementaction can be taken quickly because no further testing is necessary fordocumentation. The FCCU is one of several significant emission sourcesin petroleum refineries, so periods of excess emissions could have a significantimpact on the environment. This is particularly true because refineriesgenerally are located in clusters near industrial, urban, populated, nonattainmentareas. Because the refinery generally does not save money by operatingthe control techniques correctly and the pollutants cannot be recoveredfor resale, there is little incentive for this source category to be self-regulated.Therefore, to ensure that sources are not out of compliance for long periodsof time during which significant environmental impacts could occur, quarterlyreporting is appropriate for quarters when facilities have had a periodwhen the standard has been exceeded. In addition, the amount of data tobe provided in these cases is reasonable. Sources complying with the proposedrevised standard would need to supply only a semiannual negative declarationstatement. Only noncompliant sources would be required to provide additionalinformation in the quarterly compliance reports. <ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Administrative </ITAG>The docket is an organized and complete file of all the information consideredby EPA in the development of this rulemaking. The docket is a dynamic file,since material is added throughout the rulemaking process. The docketingsystem is intended to allow members of the public and industries involvedto readily identify and locate documents so that they can effectively participatein the rulemaking process. Along with the statement of basis and purposeof the proposed and promulgated standards and EPA responses to significantcomments, the contents of the docket, except for interagency review materials,will serve as the record in case of judicial review (section 307(d)(7)(A)).The effective date of this regulation is August 17, 1989. Section 111 ofthe Clean Air Act provides that standards of performance or revisions thereofbecome effective upon promulgation and apply to affected facilities ofwhich the construction or modification was commenced after the date ofproposal (January 17, 1984). As prescribed by section 111, the promulgation of these standards was precededby the Administrator's determination that petroleum refineries contributesignificantly to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endangerpublic health or welfare. In accordance with section 117 of the Act, publicationof these promulgated standards was preceded by consultation with appropriateadvisory committees, independent experts, and Federal departments and agencies.This regulation will be reviewed 4 years from the date of promulgationas required by the Clean Air Act. This review will include an assessmentof such factors as the need for integration with other programs, the existenceof alternative methods, enforceability, improvements in emission controltechnology, and reporting requirements. Section 317 of the Clean Air Act requires the Administrator to preparean economic impact assessment for any new source standard of performancepromulgated under section 111(b) of the Act. An economic impact assessmentwas prepared for this regulation and for other regulatory alternatives.All aspects of the assessment were considered in the formulation of thestandards to ensure that cost was carefully considered in determining BDT.The economic impact assessment is included in the BID for the proposedstandards and the promulgated standards. During the first 3 years that the proposed standards would be in effect,the public reporting burden for collection of information, including timefor reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gatheringand maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collectionof information is estimated to be 4,360 averaged annual hours. The estimatedburden for a typical respondent (including initial reports) ranges fromabout 660 hours per year for complying with the feed sulfur standard toabout 980 hours per year for complying with the standard for add-on controls.The resources required by EPA and State and local agencies to process thereports and to maintain records for the first 3 years would be about 0.15person-years per year. Information collection requirements associated with this regulation havebeen approved by OMB under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Actof 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3> and have been assigned OMB control number 2060-0061. Under Executive Order 12291, EPA is required to judge whether a regulationis a ``major rule'' and therefore subject to the requirements of a regulatoryimpact analysis (RIA). The Agency has determined that this regulation wouldresult in none of the adverse economic effects set forth in Section 1 ofthe Order as grounds for finding a regulation to be a ``major rule.'' Thefifth-year annualized costs of the standards are expected to be $45.8 millionfor the projected 17 newly constructed, modified, and reconstructed FCCUregenerators that could be affected by the standards during the first 5years after the effective date of the standards. The economic analysisshows that the standards would not have a significant impact on petroleumrefineries if all FCCU owners or operators subject to these standards usedscrubbers. The standards would have a small effect on profitability (aprofit decrease of 0.8 percent). The Agency has, therefore, concluded thatthis regulation is not a ``major rule'' under Executive Order 12291. The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires the identification of potentiallyadverse impacts of Federal regulations upon small business entities. TheAct specifically requires the completion of a Regulatory Flexibility Analysisin those instances where small business impacts are possible. Because thesestandards impose no adverse economic impacts, a Regulatory FlexibilityAnalysis has not been conducted.
