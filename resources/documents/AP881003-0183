The foreign minister, Farouk al-Shara, told a midday newsconference at the United Nations he had ``good news for theAmerican people. ...   ``One of the American hostages will be released within one hourfrom now. He can be released any minute.''   He spoke shortly after 1 p.m. EDT. There had been no report ofany hostage freed as of two hours later.   Kidnappers holding three American professors and one Indianeducator said today they will free one hostage at the west Beirutheadquarters of the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestinianrefugees.   The announcement from Islamic Jihad for the Liberation ofPalestine came in a 36-word handwritten statement in Arabicdelivered to a western news agency in Beirut.   The Syrian foreign minister said the hostage, whose name he saidhe did not know, ``will be released in Lebanon, where he waskidnapped, and the Syrian security forces will bring him toDamascus to hand him over to the American ambassador.   NBC News and CBS News and, in Beirut, the Voice of Lebanon radiostation reported that Alann Steen, 49, of Boston, was beingreleased. State Department officials said they could not confirmthe report.   Steen's wife, Virginia, told The Associated Press in a telephoneinterview that she had talked with the State Department hoursearlier.   ``We're just waiting and watching like everybody else. ...There's nothing confirmed yet,'' she said.   President Reagan, asked during a picture-taking session if hethought a hostage was about to be released, replied:   ``It's hard to tell with what little information we have. As faras we know, no hostages has been released yet. We have no word onthat.''   Earlier, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the UnitedStates had been told by another government that a hostage held byIranian sympathizers was being released imminently.   Fitzwater said U.S. government officials ``received reports''this morning that a hostage would be set free, and said that thereports came from a ``third-party government in the region.''   At the State Department, an official who spoke on condition ofanonymity said the latest report came from the Islamic Jihadthrough the Syrian government.   He said that was the group holding four American educators andany release was likely to come from those four hostages. A total ofnine Americans are held hostage in Lebanon.   The four educators believed held by Islamic Jihad, all capturedJan. 24, 1987, are:   Steen, a journalism professor at Beirut University College;Jesse Turner, a visiting professor at the school; Robert Pohill, anassistant business professor, and Mithileswar Singh, an Indiancitizen holding resident alien status in the United States.   Nearly four months after they were taken captive, Turner said ina videotape released by Islamic Jihad that Steen was suffering fromhigh blood pressure, was in ``pitiful'' health and was expected todie at any moment despite being under a doctor's care.   At the White House, Fitzwater said, ``We have received reportsthat a hostage would be released,'' the presidential spokesmansaid. ``But we have not received a name, and I cannot comment anyfurther.'' He said he did not know if the hostage purportedly to bereleased is an American.   During his daily White House news briefing, Fitzwater said thetip off to a hostage release was relayed to U.S. officials inWashington by an American embassy overseas.   Last Friday, Reagan, while on a campaign trip to Chicago, deniedthat the administration was steeped in negotiations with Iranianofficials in Geneva aimed at securing the release of at least fiveAmerican hostages by Oct. 7, as a report published in Israel held.   Earlier in the week, however, the president, during a meeting inNew York with representatives of Persian Gulf states, toldreporters he was optimistic about the hostage situation. He alsosaid, however, that he didn't want to talk about it.   In Beirut on Saturday, kidnappers holding three Americaneducators and an Indian professor said they would release onehostage as a goodwill gesture.   The group, the Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine,did not say in its statement which of the hostages it would free,or when.   Fitzwater said, ``Our situation is the same. Our policy is thesame. No deals. No quid pro quos.''   ``First of all, we need to wait and see that it does happen,''he said, noting that ``we have had some similar kinds of reports inthe past ... that fell through. ... There is a concern, in thesense that we don't know what their motives are in any of theseactions.''   In an interview published today, the spiritual leader of anumbrella group for kidnappers holding foreign hostages said hethought the problem was nearing an end.   ``When the hostage question shifts to high-level talks betweenbig powers, and they start speaking of deadlines, that means thequestion is nearing its end,'' Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah,spiritual head of Hezbollah, was quoted as saying in the weeklyMonday Morning magazine.   The Christian al-Markazia news agency carried advance excerptsof the interview on Sunday.   Hezbollah, or Party of God, is believed to be the umbrella groupfor kidnappers holding most of the 17 foreign hostages in Lebanon.

He was taken prisoner June 9, 1885; IslamicJihad claimed responsibility.   _Joseph James Cicippio, acting comptroller of the university,captured Sept. 12, 1986.
