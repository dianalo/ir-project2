Company Makes Embroidered Patches That Reach The Stars</HEAD><DATELINE>WEAVERVILLE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Pride, not profit, inspires ConradIndustries Inc. to embroider the patches that adorn the space suitsof the astronauts, the company's president says.   Conrad has embroidered the patch for Discovery, designed intribute to the seven Challenger astronauts, as it has for everymanned mission since Apollo 12, the second moon landing.   The Discovery patch shows a stylized shuttle rising into the thesky on a plume of fire and smoke and streaking through a red,V-like vector. A multi-rayed sun creeps over the horizon and theBig Dipper hangs in the sky.   NASA said the sunrise represents a new beginning; the launch, asafe mission; and the red vector, the symbol of aeronautics, thetraditional strength of the space agency.   The seven stars of the dipper symbolize Challenger astronauts.   The patch has five colors, but such emblems can have up to 19,compared with three colors in a typical commercial or militarydesign, said company president Bernhard Conrad.   ``We sometimes spend a dollar and charge a dime. But we do itfor the prestige, the satisfaction and the chance to sell tocollectors,'' he said, adding that the emblems represent only asmall part of its $11 million annual volume.</TEXT><HEAD>DeWitt Plans Vigil For Home-Town Astronaut</HEAD><DATELINE>DeWITT, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Clinton County residents will gatherThursday morning for a prayer vigil as David Hilmers climbs intothe space shuttle Discovery for the first U.S. space mission sincethe Challenger disaster.
