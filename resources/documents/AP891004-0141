Fawaz Younis, grabbed by FBI agents aboard a yacht in 1987 andbrought to the United States to stand trial, told U.S. DistrictCourt Judge Aubrey Robinson that ``I am not a member'' of anyterrorist group.   Younis said the two Americans on the Jordanian airliner were``treated as friends'' by the hijackers during a 30-hour ordealover the Mediterranean Sea that ended with the 70 passengers andcrew members being freed. The hijackers then blew up the aircraft.   The judge ordered Younis to serve 30 years for hostage taking,20 years for aircraft piracy and five years for conspiring to takehostages, following his March 14 conviction by a jury on three ofsix criminal charges. The sentences are to run concurrently.   After the sentencing, Younis's attorney, Frank Carter, promisedto appeal the case on ``20 different issues.'' He said that thequestion of U.S. jurisdiction is a critical one and that ``I don'tthink it (the hijacking) had anything to do with Americanswhatsoever.''   Assistant U.S. attorney Ramsey Johnson urged Robinson to imposea sentence of life imprisonment, but the judge said he wouldn'tbecause no one was killed in the hijacking. Jordanian sky marshalsaboard the plane were beaten, but there was testimony at Younis'strial that he ordered the violence stopped.   But the judge said a lengthy sentence must be imposed becausetime ``will never wipe out in the minds'' of the passengers andcrew the ``terror'' they experienced.   U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens called the sentence ``substantial''and ``fair,'' adding that it ``vindicates the victims'' and sends a``clear message'' to anyone ``who would engage in acts ofinternational terrorism.''   Having spent the last two years in custody, Younis will beeligible for parole in eight years, said Stephens.   But Carter predicted that Younis ``will never be paroled'' andthat he will have to serve at least 20 years of his sentence, withcredit for the two he already has served. Federal prisonersgenerally serve out two-thirds of their terms unless paroled.   Carter said the federal law giving the government authority toprosecute Younis focuses on taking into custody someone who has``slipped into the United States'' after committing an illegal actabroad. In this instance, the FBI ``reached out and dragged'' himhere, said Carter.   Younis was lured aboard a yacht in the Mediterranean on Sept.13, 1987, with the prospect of a drug deal and a party, accordingto testimony at his trial.   A member of the Lebanese Amal movement, Younis told the judge hehad been ``kidnapped'' by FBI agents. He carried out the hijackingbecause he ``received an order'' from his military commander, whois ``neither a terrorist nor a blood-thirsty beast,'' Younis saidin a statement he read to the judge.   ``I exerted maximum effort to guarantee safety and return'' toBeirut, said Younis.   At his trial, Younis testified that he was instructed by hissuperiors to fly the plane to Tunis, Tunisia, where a meeting ofArab League representatives was in progress.   During the hijacking, he read a declaration demanding the leaguedecide that one Arab nation allow all Palestinians to settle thereand that Palestinians be removed from Lebanon.   ``Had I been with the Contra forces in Central America, wouldthat be terrorism'' or would he be considered one of the``freedom-fighters?'' Younis asked the judge.</TEXT></DOC>
