<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-64-0319 </DOCNO><TEXT>The Cadotte Member (Albian) of northwestern Alberta Peace River Formationis a clastic shoreline to offshore progradational sequence, with an unusualprominent erosional scour surface that subdivides this sequence intolower and upper units. The lower unit is finer grained and consists ofa coarsening-upward offshore to middle shoreface shale, siltstone andsandstone sequence. The offshore facies consists of interbedded shale,siltstone and sandstone, representing deposition below storm-weatherwave base. The overlying lower shoreface facies consists of interbeddedsandstone and shale with a moderate amount of bioturbation. Depositiontook place below the average storm-weather wave base. The gradationallyoverlying middle shoreface facies consists of cross-stratified sandstone,bioturbation restricted to a thin agillaceous zone near its top. Depositionoccurred below fairweather wave base where severe storms reworked bottomsediments. The upper unit, erosionally overlying the lower unit in over80% of the wells studied, comprises the following facies. The upper shorefaceconsists of medium to coarse grained sandstone, pebbly sandstone andconglomerate. Macaronichnus segregatis occurs at the top of this faciesand into the base of the overlying facies. Deposition occurred in currentswept longshore troughs and rip channels of a barred high-energy shoreline.Gradationally overlying is the foreshore consisting of medium grainedsandstone deposited by the action of swash and backwash on high-energybeaches. A rooted and highly homogenized sandstone representing the backshoregradationally overlies the foreshore facies. This sequence resulted fromthe seaward progradation of a high-energy barred coastline. The seawardmigration of the longshore trough and rip channel created the erosionalscour surface and eroded the longshore bar. 11 refs., 8 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
