For ``Bigg Regg'' and a growing number of other barbers thesedays, a little art school training is about as useful as abilitywith the clippers. They don't just cut hair _ they sculpt scalps.   ``I've seen some crazy haircuts,'' Potts said as he chiseledshortwaves, or vertical lines, into the hair of 18-year-old LorenzoDavis.   ``Kids come in here showing me pictures of some rap star orsomething they drew at school and say `Can you do this?'''   Other popular scalp designs include nicknames and shoe emblems.Potts said he always has a customer in his chair and a customerwaiting.   In Mount Clemens, barber Darren Campbell said he sculpts about80 ``line dimension'' haircuts a week, charging up to $20.   ``I do it all freehand. That's the art of it. And if I make amistake, there's no erasing,'' Campbell said. ``If I make onemistake I have to cut it all off.''   ``That's why it's an art form, and that's why there are not toomany barbers who will do it,'' he said.   Keith Bell, 16, a Mount Clemens High School freshman, said hisNike gym shoe logo haircut got mixed reactions at home.   ``My mother didn't like it. She said it was stupid,'' Bell said.``But my dad liked it. He said it was different.''</TEXT><DATELINE>TONKAWA, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Lester ``Junior'' Gorman never liked a bigcrowd, and that kept him from getting his diploma when he refusedto go to his high school graduation ceremony a half-century ago.   He was missing again this year when the names of the TonkawaHigh School Class of 1939 were listed for a reunion. But this timethe gap did not go unnoticed.   Gorman, who now lives in Pharr, Texas, will get his diploma inthe mail this week, 50 years after he graduated.   ``Back in those days, if you didn't go through the ceremony andwear the cap and gown, you didn't get a diploma,'' said Mary LouGorman, his sister-in-law. ``Junior was pig-headed enough not to doit, and he didn't like crowds.''   Mrs. Gorman said her husband, Lee, realized some months ago thathis brother never received his diploma when his name was not on thelist of graduates for a 50th class reunion.   Before he died May 6, Lee Gorman told Superintendent Ron Hodgesabout the missing diploma, and Hodges presented the diploma to Mrs.Gorman last week.   ``The brothers hadn't seen each other for 30 years,'' she said.``When I sent the diploma to Junior, I included a letter sayingthis was the last thing your brother did for you.''</TEXT></DOC>
