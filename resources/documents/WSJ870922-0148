When he goes to the movies, he is likely to see a U.S.-made film. When he strolls down the street, there's country singer Johnny Cash in life-size cardboard cutouts directing customers to Canada Trust Co.'s automatic teller machines. When he reaches into the refrigerator during halftime of a Denver Broncos football game, out comes a bottle of Miller beer. Then at day's end, who's on the evening news? None other than Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney cozying up to President Reagan.    It is all a far cry from the vision of Pierre Trudeau's Liberal government. During the 1970s, it was Trudeau who tried to reduce Canada's dependence on the U.S. by promoting trade with other countries and by restricting U.S. investment in the country. But the strategy didn't work because other countries didn't buy enough Canadian goods or invest heavily in Canada. Now Canada is more Americanized than ever. Now, also, the old angst is rising again, sparked in part by Mr. Mulroney's plan to forge a trade agreement with Washington that would open the way to new incursions from the south.    To an extent, Canadians themselves are to blame for the rampant Americanization because they succumb to U.S. attractions. But often Canada has no choice but to keep in step with the U.S.    No other country is such a hostage to U.S. policy. When the U.S. revised its tax system last year, Canada had to follow suit or lose important businesses. When the U.S. deregulated its airline industry, Canada had to take similar action because so many Canadians flocked to U.S. border cities to take advantage of lower fares. Canada was even forced to tighten its immigration rules this year when a tough new U.S. policy prompted hundreds of Latin Americans working illegally in the U.S. to head for the Canadian border.    So dependent is Canada on the U.S. that, in projecting Canadian market trends, economists like Sherry Atkinson spend most of their time analyzing U.S. data. Ms. Atkinson, the chief economist at the Toronto securities firm of Burns Fry Ltd., was recruited from the U.S. Federal Reserve Board four years ago because of her U.S. training.    While Canada's huge trade with the U.S. gives it one of the world's highest standards of living, it also puts it on a tightrope. U.S. trade actions can devastate Canadian industries that rely heavily on the U.S. market. The potash industry, for one, is reeling from stiff anti-dumping levies that were provisionally slapped on its shipments to the U.S. last month.    No two other countries do so much business with each other. But the trade is much more important to Canada. U.S. imports of goods and services from Canada account for more than a fifth of Canada's economic output, but U.S. exports to Canada amount to just 1% of U.S. output.    Now Prime Minister Mulroney's Conservative government is embarking on a different strategy from the Trudeau strategy that failed. It is trying to move closer to the U.S. by negotiating a pact that would eliminate trade barriers on both sides. In addition, Canada wants the pact to set up a new, binding arrangement to referee trade disputes between the two nations.    The initiative has divided the country. Nationalists warn that by eliminating Canada's own barriers -- mainly investment controls and subsidies -- such a pact would lead to a U.S. takeover of Canada. Even now, despite measures to protect Canadian culture, 70% of English-language television is American. About 80% of the movies that Canadians see are American, and 75% of their book publishers are foreign-owned. Pierre Berton, Canada's best-known popular historian, warns of &quot;a slow, subtle crumbling of the nation through American influence.&quot;    In upstate New York, a new U.S. religious radio station transmits a largely fundamentalist message into the mostly Catholic, French-speaking province of Quebec. TV signals from Detroit are relayed by Canadian satellite to the most remote corners of the Arctic.    The Canadian beer market had once been considered impregnable because of national pride in local brews and an outspoken disdain for weaker U.S. beers. But in the past five years, Budweiser, Coors and Miller brands, produced under license by Canadian breweries, have captured almost a fifth of the Canadian market. When Miller High Life was offered in a long-neck bottle in 1983, almost the entire Canadian beer industry decided to scrap its traditional stubby beer bottles in favor of the sleeker American shape.    Because of fans like Ottawa barman Tim Hogan, who won't cross town to see the local Rough Riders but drives 6 1/2 hours to Buffalo twice a year to see the Bills, the Canadian Football League is on the ropes. Its Montreal franchise, the Alouettes, folded this summer because of poor crowds.    So familiar are U.S. celebrities that Canadian companies often use them for promotions. Actress Bea Arthur promotes the country's largest drugstore chain, Shoppers Drug Mart.    Some Canadians complain that Prime Minister Mulroney has &quot;gone American,&quot; too. Only after widespread grumbling about his &quot;presidential style&quot; did he abandon a lectern like the one used by President Reagan. When Mila Mulroney became the first prime minister's wife to hire personal staff and use government offices, government critics rebuked her for having &quot;First Lady&quot; pretensions.    The Mulroneys also are taken to task for their frequent vacations in Florida. But, in that respect, they are no different from many other Canadians. Six percent of all Canadians (locally dubbed Snowbirds) went to Florida last winter. In December alone, more than 5.5 million Canadian dollars ($4.2 million) of social-security pension checks were mailed to Canadians in Florida.    Canadian nationalists object most vigorously to U.S. ownership of Canadian industry. Canada has more of its economy foreign-owned than any other industrialized nation. Before becoming prime minister, Mr. Mulroney, like millions of other Canadians, worked for a U.S.-controlled company, in his case Iron Ore Co. of Canada.    Pressured by the U.S., Canada's Conservative government in recent years largely scrapped discriminatory laws aimed at increasing Canadian ownership of the country's industries. Lately U.S. firms have moved into sectors that were formerly off limits, such as hospital management, utilities and stockbroking.    &quot;It's a sad day when the federal government abandons Canadian ownership of public utilities,&quot; declares Charles Caccia, who was a Trudeau cabinet minister. He notes that the U.S. restricts foreign ownership of its utilities.    Washington is pressing Canada to remove remaining curbs on U.S. investment to ensure that U.S. companies are treated just like locally owned firms in Canada. Mr. Mulroney welcomes U.S. investment and is trying to make Canada as hospitable as possible to foreign investors. Over strong opposition -- party objections, for example, the Mulroney government is pushing through Parliament legislation strengthening drug patent laws as urged by brand-name drug firms -- the big ones in Canada are all foreign-owned -- and by the Reagan administration. The current law favors generic-drug companies, which in Canada are largely Canadian-owned.    But Mr. Mulroney's boldest initiative has been the proposed trade pact. Whether it will be reached in the current negotiations may be known in a matter of days. If the talks fail, many Canadians feel, Canada can't turn elsewhere. &quot;I don't believe anyone else gives a damn about Canada outside of the U.S.,&quot; says William Deeks, the president of the mineral marketing arm of Toronto-based Noranda Inc.    Canada can't afford trade quarrels with the U.S. Ottawa slapped tariffs on books and other U.S. goods last year to retaliate for a 35% U.S. levy on cedar shakes and shingles. The Canadian sanctions were recently lifted because they were hurting sales of Canadian booksellers but hardly making a dent on U.S. publishers.    The Mulroney government believes that a trade pact could avoid such quarrels and help relieve Canadian unemployment, currently 8.8%. The government's stand is supported by a major economic inquiry, which had been commissioned by the Trudeau government and was submitted to the Mulroney government in 1985. Without a trade deal, &quot;Canada will be worse off compared with everybody, even Britain, over time,&quot; says Donald Macdonald, a former Trudeau finance minister, who headed the inquiry.    Public-opinion polls show that about half of Canadians favor free trade with the U.S., anticipating economic benefits. Canadians are mostly better off as a result of their country's close links with the U.S. But one recent government survey found that 70% of Canadians believe that the Mulroney government is &quot;sacrificing&quot; Canadian interests to maintain close links with Washington. Another government survey found that 65% were worried that Canadians would &quot;gradually lose our ability to make our own economic decisions.&quot; The government acknowledges that if all trade barriers were removed, jobs would be lost in some protected industries, such as furniture, shoe manufacturing and toiletries.    Another Canadian fear is that by moving closer to the U.S. Canada will absorb U.S. problems, such as the high U.S. crime rate. Canada's homicide rate is a third of that of the U.S. &quot;We like our system of government, our spirit of tolerance, safety in our streets, our way of doing things,&quot; said opposition Liberal Party leader John Turner. &quot;We do not intend to become the 51st state of the American union.&quot;    Labor unions, churches and others have warned they won't accept any tampering with Canada's social-security programs, which provide a much more generous safety net for the poor, the sick and the elderly than the U.S. Social Security system. Fred Litwin, a Canadian securities analyst working in New York, says, &quot;If I should become sick with something like AIDS, I could go back to Canada and get treatment. The idea of guaranteed free medical care for the rest of my life is too appealing to give up.&quot;    Some Canadians worry, too, that a closer relationship with the U.S. could jeopardize Canada's independent foreign policy. Currently, Canada provides aid to Nicaragua and Cuba and takes a much tougher line than Washington toward South African apartheid.    The country's socialist party, the New Democrats, has capitalized on Canadian fears of U.S. domination. The party, which is highly critical of U.S. domestic and foreign policies, is leading the polls for the first time in its history.    The New Democrats are supported by the country's major unions. The Canadian wing of the United Auto Workers broke away to form a Canadian union two years ago, and Canadian members of the International Longshoremen's Association are considering similar action.    Fears of U.S. domination are as old as Canada itself. In 1881, Canada, then a 14-year-old dominion, began building an east-west railroad. One big reason: to satisfy British Columbia and prevent its welcoming a threatened U.S. annexation.    John Halstead, a former Canadian diplomat who opposes the trade pact, says: &quot;Canada has never made economic sense, and Canadians have always had to pay an economic price for their political and cultural identity. The question now is whether Canadians are prepared to continue paying such a price.&quot;    ---                 Canada's 10 Largest Companies          (By 1986 Sales, in billions of U.S. dollars)    COMPANY                                          SALES    General Motors of Canada Ltd.
