In a separate vote, the commission adopted final rulesthat will make it tougher for brokerage firms to publishquotes on risky, low-priced stocks. Before quoting prices ona penny stock, firms will be required to review financialdata about the company issuing the security. Brokers alsowill be required to keep on file any SEC orders issued duringthe previous year suspending trading in the security.</LP><TEXT>   The package of rules put out for comment by the SEC wouldrequire penny-stock firms to disclose to investors thepotential risks they face if they buy penny stocks. Inaddition, firms would be prohibited from selling a pennystock without first disclosing the current market price andthe commission structure. Firms also would be required toprovide customers with a monthly report on the value of theirholdings.   The proposed rules were mandated by legislation pushedthrough Congress last year by Rep. Edward Markey (D., Mass.),chairman of a House subcommittee that oversees the SEC. In astatement, Rep. Markey praised the SEC's action, saying: &quot;Ourintent in passing that bill and requiring new SEC rules wasto clamp down on penny-stock fraud in the most comprehensiveand dramatic fashion possible.&quot;   Sarah Ackerson, who heads the SEC's market-manipulationprogram, said the rules are designed to protect investorsfrom unscrupulous penny-stock salesmen who drop out of sightonce a sale is completed. &quot;Just from a fundamental investorinformation level, this {package of rules} will make atremendous difference,&quot; she said.   The rules also take aim at abusive &quot;blank-check&quot;offerings, in which a broker sells stock in a company with nodefined business. Under the proposed rules, investors wouldhave to be informed before their money is invested and wouldthen have at least 20 days to get their money back.</TEXT></DOC>
