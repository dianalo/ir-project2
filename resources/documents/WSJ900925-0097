Preliminary population figures, the first census reportsso far, show West Virginia with a 9% drop since 1980, thelargest for a state. As coal mechanization sped on, 143,000people left the Mountain State by 1989, an earlier reportsaid. The employment slump ended recently, but &quot;our bigconcern now is what a national recession will do&quot; to thestate's jobs, says Edward Merrifield, a state labor researchofficial.</LP><TEXT>   Analysts warn that steady out-migration from an area cancause a downward job spiral, deterring new business as thelabor supply dwindles. Industrial states like Michigan,Illinois and Pennsylvania also lost people, the early 1990figures suggest. But a combined 7.1 million people migratedto sunny California, Arizona, Texas and Florida between 1980and 1989, many taking new service jobs.   The worker migration means &quot;another union organizing task,in a more hostile location,&quot; complains AFL-CIO economist JohnZalusky.                                                                                                          UNIONS ESCALATE efforts to influence reapportionment inwake of census.   The American Federation of Federal, State, County andMunicipal Employees leads a drive to help Democrats control16 key state legislatures and win hot gubernatorial contestsin California, Texas and Florida Nov. 6. The governors' vetopower will give them a &quot;key role&quot; when state lawmakers startcongressional redistricting in 1991, notes AFL-CIO politicalchief John Perkins. &quot;This is when your investment paysdividends for five elections {through the year 2000},&quot; a FoodWorkers official adds.   Some 45 unions, including auto, steel and communicationsworkers, teachers and letter carriers, contributed over halfof $5 million raised for the Democrats' five-year &quot;Project500,&quot; and unions &quot;give us the bodies&quot; for polling andresearch, a party spokesman says.                                                                                                          SEX, AGE AND SKILL factors loom large for the future workforce.   The Bureau of Labor Statistics sees an increase of olderworkers by 2000. Of men over 54 years old, 68% will beworking, up from 67% in 1988, and of women in the same agegroup, 49% will be working, up from 43.5%. But with newcensus data, the agency may boost those numbers even further,showing more oldsters on the job, BLS statistician HowardFullerton says. By 2000, the median worker age will rise to35, and 85% of new workers will be less technically trainedwomen and minorities, concludes a Purdue University study.   The census reports will show a sizable widening of the paygap between high-school and college graduates, reflecting thedecisions of many to skip college in the 1980s, saysUniversity of Maryland economist Frank Levy.   That gap rose from a median $2,659 for men and $5,486 forwomen, ages 25 to 34, to an inflation-adjusted $9,089 and$7,812, respectively, from 1979 to 1987.                                                                                                          STATES LOSING JOBS get some advice from Hudson Instituteofficial William Johnston: Don't try to lure new factories inthis service economy. Instead, &quot;visit {Disney Chairman}Michael Eisner to see if he wants to locate a theme park&quot; inthe area.                                                                                                          UNDERCOUNTING could fuel legislative moves to boostimmigration quotas by showing an excessive labor shortage,says National Planning Association economist Richard Belous.If short counts are concentrated in certain immigrant-heavy,low-income localities, they could also reduce federaljob-training grants.                                                                                                          DOWN ON THE FARM: They aren't keeping them there. About3.7 million people were working on more-mechanized farms andranches in mid-July, down 3% from the same 1989 week and 19%from 1980, the Agriculture Department said. But hired handsare on the rise, supplanting many farm-family workers.                                                                                                          POPULATION AGE CHANGES have a marked effect onunemployment rates.   So concludes a new study by Paul Flaim, BLS chief of laborforce statistics. An influx of post-World War II baby boomersinto the job market helped push the jobless rate upward inthe 1960s and 1970s. &quot;Short on skills and work experience,youths could not readily substitute for older workers,&quot; soemployers were less eager to hire them, Mr. Flaim says.   But maturing and even &quot;graying&quot; of the boomers sparked the1980s decline in the rate. So did a drop in the number ofteenagers, along with a shrinkage in the size of the workforce. Changing age demographics, not any rise in the demandfor labor, explain a 10-year drop in the jobless rate from5.9% to 5.3% by 1989, Mr. Flaim argues.   In the '90s, a further shrinkage of young job seekers isexpected, but many employers will stiffen demands to showskills.                                                                                                          THE CHECKOFF: Noting that no labor-market data will emergefrom the 1990 census until 1992 or later, economist SarLevitan muses, &quot;The more advanced the technology, the slowerthe data publication.&quot; . . . No solace here: For those whowonder about domestic energy capacity with Iraqi-held oilshut off, the Census Bureau says oil and gas extractionemployment is down 25% from 1980.</TEXT></DOC>
