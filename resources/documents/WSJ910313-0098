Separately, Genetics Institute said it will request arehearing by the full Court of Appeals of the recent decisioninvalidating Genetics Institute's patent coveringerythropoetin, or EPO, products. Analysts said the requestisn't expected to change the decision.</LP><TEXT>   The Washington court's decision last week, favoring rivalAmgen Inc., sparked a 35% plunge in Genetics Instituteshares. The stock closed yesterday before the expected losswas announced at $39.875, up 87.5 cents, in nationalover-the-counter trading.   Genetics Institute said the $18.3 million first-quartercharge includes $11 million related to the EPO case and $7.3million for possible losses in the NeoRx investment. GarenBohlin, executive vice president, added that the EPO-relatedcharge &quot;is meant to cover all future liabilities&quot; that mayresult from losing the patent appeal, including potentialdamages Genetics Institute might have to pay to Amgen.   The company said that it wrote down the NeoRx stakebecause &quot;it no longer necessarily expects to maintain itsinterest as a long-term investment.&quot; Analysts said NeoRx, ofSeattle, was overextended by too many long-term researchprojects. Its research on potential antibody-based agents forcancer diagnosis and treatment has been funded by severalconcerns, including Genetics Institute and Eastman Kodak Co.Earlier this year, NeoRx announced plans to cut its workforce by 40%.   Genetics Institute said it acquired the NeoRx stock for anaverage of $10 to $12 a share about five years ago. Innational over-the-counter trading yesterday, NeoRx sharesclosed at 93.75 cents, unchanged.   Linda Miller, a PaineWebber Inc. analyst, said thedecision to write off the investment is &quot;an attempt to make aclean sweep.&quot;   Mr. Bohlin said the company decided to &quot;put less emphasison certain programs,&quot; including those with NeoRx, &quot;in aneffort to focus on the key programs,&quot; such as experimentaldrugs to promote bone healing. He added that GeneticsInstitute retains rights to certain NeoRx antibodies and isstill conducting research with them as potential anti-cancerdrugs.   In the year-ago first quarter, Genetics Institute had aloss of $7 million on revenue of $8.6 million.</TEXT></DOC>
