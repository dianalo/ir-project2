The offer originally was scheduled to expire at 6 p.m. EDT yesterday.    The oil and natural gas company reiterated that it is actively discussing the possibility of a merger or acquisition that could result in the consolidation of its operations. Consequently, if an agreement concerning these matters isn't reached by July 24, Summit said it may push back the deadline further to permit preferred shareholders to be fully informed before they decide whether to exchange their stock.    Summit said its management, directors and employee profit-sharing trust may decide to withdraw preferred shares tendered previously, depending on the outcome of talks. As of the close of business Monday, Summit said 373,494, or 66.2%, of the 569,200 preferred shares outstanding were tendered. The exchange offer began Feb. 12.    Separately, the company said it sold some of its oil and natural gas properties in Kansas and California to two unrelated parties for a total of about $1.2 million in cash. Summit didn't identify the buyers. It said it will use some of the proceeds to reduce bank debt. </TEXT></DOC>
