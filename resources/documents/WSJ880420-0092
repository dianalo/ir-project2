Earnings at Bankers Trust New York Corp. were nearly flat and Mellon Bank Corp. returned to profitability, but losses widened substantially at Dallas-based MCorp.    The 34% earnings climb at New York-based Citicorp, the nation's largest banking concern, came on improved results for all of its core businesses: consumer, institutional and investment banking. On the other side of the continent, Wells Fargo andamp; Co. did even better, with a 54% rise. Earnings rose 19% at Bank of Boston Corp. and 18% at First Fidelity Bancorp.    Citicorp   Citicorp Chairman John S. Reed told shareholders at the annual meeting that the company's results are &quot;very much on a trajectory&quot; to meet its goals of 12% to 18% annual growth in earnings per share and 16% return on equity.    Net interest income, excluding operating costs and provisions for credit losses, totaled $1.69 billion, a 10% increase over a year earlier.    Total non-interest revenue rose 6% to $1.35 billion. Sharply lower foreign exchange results and fees collected on mortgage securities depressed non-interest income. Citicorp executives said that 1987 results in those two categories were unusually strong and that the 1988 first-quarter results were more normal.    Citicorp's operating expenses dropped 6% from the fourth-quarter 1987 level. Citicorp's addition to its loan-loss reserves fell 40% from the year-earlier level to $283 million. Credit quality continued to improve as net write-offs dropped 8% from the 1987 first quarter to $336 million.    Citicorp's common stock fell 25 cents to close at $19 a share in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.    Bankers Trust New York   In reporting nearly flat earnings, Bankers Trust New York said increased net interest income and a smaller provision for credit losses were offset by higher non-interest expense and lower non-interest income.    Fully taxable net interest income grew 19% to $238.3 million from the year-earlier quarter. The increase stemmed from a higher contribution from factors including an improved interest rate spread, or the difference between what the bank pays for funds and what it charges.    Net interest income was reduced about $15 million in the first quarters of both 1988 and 1987, because Bankers Trust placed on non-accrual status about $580 million in medium-term and long-term loans to borrowers in Brazil and Ecuador during the first quarter of 1987. Loans on non-accrual status aren't currently earning interest.    The provision for loan losses for the latest quarter fell to $10 million from $22 million a year earlier. Net write-offs dropped to $6.8 million from $20.4 million. The allowance for loan losses rose to $1.3 billion, or 5.08% of total loans, compared with $592.3 million, or 2.26% of loans, a year earlier.    The provision is the latest amount set aside for loan losses; the allowance is the total set aside to date.    Non-interest expense grew 14% to $355.2 million. Bankers Trust attributed the increase to investments in new business opportunities and to a weaker dollar.    Non-interest income fell 3% to $330.8 million because of lower profit from trading activities.    Profit from trading activities fell 52% to $48.2 million. Foreign-exchange trading resulted in a loss of $19.4 million, compared with profit of $82.8 million a year earlier. Trading account profit and commissions more than tripled to $67.6 million.    Assets advanced 3.1% to $59.7 billion.    Bankers Trust common stock edged down 12.5 cents to close at $30.75 in Big Board composite trading yesterday.    Mellon Bank   Mellon Bank's return to profitability was aided by one-time gains and reduced loan problems at the Pittsburgh-based company.    The latest quarter included a $9 million gain from consolidating its CashStream automated teller machine network with a system owned by CoreStates Financial Corp. and a $7 million gain from the sale of lease residuals and other assets.    Mellon's provision for possible loan losses was $45 million, down from $175 million in last year's first quarter. Net loan write-offs were $44 million, down from $95 million in the first quarter of 1987. (Included in the credit write-off in the latest quarter was a loss of $11 million that Mellon incurred when it exchanged $26 million of Mexican public-sector loans in that country's debt-exchange program.)    As of March 31, Mellon's total reserve for possible credit losses was $1.13 billion, or 5.53% of total loans, compared with $574 million, or 2.57% of total loans, a year earlier.    Net interest income, on a taxable equivalent basis, fell 17% to $205 million in the first quarter. On this basis, income from tax-exempt and tax-favored assets is inflated to a level that would produce the same net income if the assets were fully taxable. Service revenue rose 4.6% to $158 million.    At the end of the first quarter, Mellon Bank had assets of $30.9 billion, down from $34.4 billion at the end of the first quarter 1987.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Mellon common shares rose 50 cents to close at $28.    Wells Fargo   San Francisco-based Wells Fargo's strong earnings gains continued in the first period, as the profitability of its lending operations increased and non-interest income showed a substantial jump.    The bank's returns on assets and equity for the period rank it among the half-dozen top-performing large banks in the country. Its return on equity jumped to 24.2% from 15.1% in the year-earlier quarter, partly because its equity has decreased as a result of foreign loan-loss reserves taken last year. Wells Fargo has also been among the most effective banks in controlling non-interest expense, mainly through continued cost-reductions associated with its 1986 acquisition of Crocker National Bank.    Net interest income rose 6.2% to $478.6 million, Wells Fargo said, primarily because the bank's interest spread opened up to 4.76% from 4.61% in last year's quarter. The bank's return on average assets grew to an extremely robust 1.10%, from 0.72% in the year-earlier period.    Non-interest income rose 33% to $156.2 million; last year, the category was trimmed by a $20.1 million special charge. The year-earlier charge didn't affect earnings, however. The latest period's non-interest income was boosted by sizable increases in earnings from service fees on accounts and from trust and investment services.    Non-interest expenses declined 2.2% to $371.6 million. Wells Fargo reduced its net loan write-offs by 31%, to $55.3 million.    The common stock rose 12.5 cents yesterday to close at $50.50 a share in Big Board composite trading.    First Fidelity Bancorp.    Newark, N.J.-based First Fidelity, reporting its first results following the merger of Fidelcor Inc., Philadelphia, and the previous First Fidelity Bancorp., said its higher profit mainly reflected a 14% gain in non-interest income and significant increases in commercial and consumer loans.    Despite the profit climb, First Fidelity's common stock fell 75 cents to close at $36 a share in Big Board composite trading yesterday.    In the latest quarter, the regional banking company had narrower interest rate spreads, a modest increase in expenses and a higher loan-loss provision. The company has $29.4 billion in assets.    Bank of Boston   Bank of Boston's earnings increase was bolstered by strong interest income and an increase in non-interest income.    The company said that during the first quarter it changed its accounting for credit-related fees. As a result, certain fees formerly recognized as income have been deferred, which reduced first-quarter earnings by about four cents a share on a fully diluted basis.    Wall Street reacted coolly to the company's results. The common stock fell 37.5 cents to close at $23.625 in Big Board composite trading yesterday.    Non-interest income for the quarter was $173.1 million, compared with $135.6 million a year earlier, the company said. The increase reflects higher financial service fees, improved trading profit, higher investment portfolio gains and gains from the sale of venture-capital investments, Bank of Boston said.    Nonperforming assets totaled $1.31 billion as of March 31, compared with $886.7 million a year earlier. The company said its provision for credit losses for the quarter fell to $36 million from $45 million last year. The reserve for loan losses was $711.7 million as of March 31, or 2.88% of loans and leases outstanding.    MCorp   As expected, MCorp, Texas's second-largest bank holding company, said its net loss widened as a dismal real estate market and weak credit demand continue to hammer away at Texas banks.    MCorp, with $20.6 billion in assets at March 31, said its $58.2 million loss for the quarter included profit from discontinued operations of $4.2 million. Its $10.2 million loss in the year-earlier period included income from discontinued operations of $2.9 million.    Separately, the company said it completed the sale of its 80.1% stake in MTech Corp., a bank data-processing concern, for $281 million in cash and stock to Electronic Data Systems Corp., a General Motors Corp. unit.    The MTech sale, which will bring MCorp a $190 million gain in the second quarter, is the cornerstone of the troubled bank company's efforts to raise new equity and restructure the bank.    As reported earlier, MCorp had hoped to raise about $250 million through a new preferred stock offering, allowing the company to restructure by creating a separate entity to house a major portion of its problem loans. However, it is understood that the company is having trouble placing the new equity and has lowered its goal to $200 million from $250 million.    MCorp declined to discuss the planned offering of preferred.    MCorp said its nonperforming assets were $1.62 billion, or 7.8% of assets, at March 31, up slightly from $1.59 billion, or 7.9% of assets, at Dec. 31. But it said it expects the nonperforming assets to begin to decline during 1988.    MCorp common stock closed at $3, unchanged, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.    ---                         1988            1987                     in      per      in       per     %                  millions  share   millions  share   chg.
