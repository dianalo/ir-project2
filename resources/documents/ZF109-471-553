 400on Reader Service CardandM;From the way it was reported in the trade press-not to mention The New YorkTimes and The Wall Street Journal--you'd think Moses had come down from themountain again.andP;  But this time the tablets had only one line: &quot;IBM RISCSystem/6000.&quot;andM;IBM's first serious foray into the workstation world, known internally asRIOS, has emerged with the monikers Powerstation and Powerserver, though mostpeople refer to them collectively as the RISC System/6000.andP;  In thisacronym-happy business, &quot;Power&quot; of course has to stand for something:performance optimization with enhanced RISC.andM;The number of applications for the RISC System/6000 is still relatively small(albeit growing quickly) compared with Sun Microsystems and DEC.andO;Nevertheless, the RISC System/6000 boasts an excellent design with phenomenalprocessing power at a very aggressive price.andM;The series comprises four workstations and five servers.andP;  Although they sharethe same system architecture, they do differ in CPU clock speed, memorycapacity, cache size, bus width, I/O expandability and physical packaging.andM;The workstations are the Powerstation 320, 520, 530 and 730.andP;  ThePowerstation 320 is a desktop unit; the other machines are deskside models.andO;The 320 and 520 run at 20MHz and the 530 and 730 run at 25MHz.andM;The servers are the Powerserver 320, 520, 530, 540 and 930.andP;  The 320 is adesktop unit, the 930 resides in a 59.05-inch-high rack, and the other threecome in deskside packages.andM;All the machines are uniprocessor and use an enhanced Micro ChannelArchitecture (MCA) bus as the I/O bus.andP;  IBM says that cards for the MCA andenhanced MCA will be, for the most part, interchangeable.andP;  However, becausethe RISC System/6000 MCA cards can be larger than IBM PC AT form-factorcards, some RISC System/6000 cards (or MCA cards) may not fit into some MCAconfigurations.andM;The high-end Powerstation 730 includes graphics hardware based on chips fromSilicon Graphics.andP;  All the workstations support Silicon Graphics'GL graphicslibrary.andM;Of the nine models that IBM announced for its RISC System/6000 lineup, DRLabs picked the three most representative family members for testing.andP;  (Thedesktop 320 and deskside 520 have identical processing architectures; the 730and 930 were not available for testing at press time.)andM;Our tests confirmed what we had expected: These machines are screamers (Fig.andO;1, Fig.andP;  2).andP;  The Powerserver 540 clocked in with 42.80 MicroVAX II units ofprocessing (MVUPs), followed closely by the Powerstation 530 at 35.75 MVUPs.andO;The Powerstation 320, with its 20MHz chip set, came in at 27.86 MVUPs.andM;We also examined the X windows performance of the two Powerstations (Fig.andO;3).andP;  We used the X11perf benchmark version 1.2.andP;  On general graphicsoperations, each of the Powerstations was more than twice as fast as theDECstation 3100, DR Labs' standard workstation for measuring X windowsbenchmark comparisons.andP;  In the other tests, which include operationsimportant for terminal emulation, window management and X windows-specificitems, the Powerstations were about as fast as a DECstation 3100.andM;The IBM machines' terminal-operations performance was neck and neck with aDECstation 3100--0.94 DECstation 3100 X units of processing (DXUPs) for thePowerstation 320 and 1.03 DXUPs for the 530--but for window operations andX-specific operations, the geometric mean fell below that of a DECstation3100.andP;  For a machine with substantially more COU power than the DECstation3100, the Powerstation showed disappointing X11perrf results.andM;Thanks to the Powerstation 320 and 530's Motif graphical user interface(GUI), however, we found the workstations a pleasure to use.andP;  Theirinteractive graphics capabilities were excellent.andM;What may prove more interesting to watch than applications running on theRISC System/6000 is the fancy footwork IBM will need to position thesemachines withoiut threatening the high-end PS/2 PCs and low-end AS/400s.andO;Right now, the RISC System/6000 clearly is targeted at the technical andscientific markets, but its relatively rich instruction set includes featuressuch as string manipulation and other attributes that definitely indicatefuture commercial applications.andM;IBM  has also indicated some database development work for AIX, its flavor ofUnix.andP;  Furthermore, IBM has promised a fiber-optic connection between theRISC System/6000 and the recently announced System/390 mainframe architectureand its Enterprise Systems Connection (Escon) channel architecture.andP;  (See&quot;IBM decision to bank on clusters could put DEC behind eight ball,&quot; DR, Sept.andO;10, page 1.)andM;Armonk will have to be quite careful to avoid sabotaging some of its otherproduct lines with these introductionsandM;Also of note is the fact that, at present, the RISC System/6000 machinescontain no provision whatsoever for multiprocessing.andP;  Multiprocessing is alsoa problem for DEC, whose line of RISC-based Ultrix systems currently cannothandle effectively the interrupts generated in a multiprocessing scenario.andO;At a time when multiprocessing is coming into vogue, especially withworkstations, this is a significant shortcoming.andM;AT the heart of each of the machines is the superscalar CPU of the RISCSystem/6000 architecture.andP;  One of the basic tenets of the RISC philosophy asthe execution of one instruction per clock cycle, as opposed to the severalclock cycles often required to execute an instruction in CISC designs.andP;  TheRISC System/6000 takes that further, however, by permitting the execution ofmore than one instruction in one clock cycle.andM;It is, to a degree, parallel processing at the chip level.andP;  The RISCSystem/6000 can execute four instructions simultaneously: a branchinstruction, a condition-register instruction, a fixed-point instruction anda floating-point instruction.andP;  IBM attributes this capability to the highdegree of independence between the functional units of the CPU, as well asthe high bandwidth of the paths between them.andP;  The RISC System/6000's 184instructions are distributed among the functional units, enhancingparallelism and independence.andM;The CPU chip set include nine semicustom chips: an instruction cache unit, afixed-point unit, a floating-point unit, four data cache units, a storagecontrol unit, and a serial link and system bus adapter.andP;  (The Powerserver andPowerstation 320 and 520 models have only two data cache units.)andP;  Each chipset contains a minimum of 500,000 transistors.andP;  The chips are all joined withdata buses of 32, 64 or 128 bits (Fig.andP;  4).andM;The instruction cache unit is key to the RISC System/6000's high instructionexecution rate, for it's actually both an instruction cache and a branchprocessor.andM;The instruction cache portion has a twoway, set-associative 8KB cache with achache directory and a 32-entry, two-way, set-associative instructiontranslation look-ahead buffer.andM;The branch processor handles the incoming stream of instructions and providesthe fixed-and floating-point units with a steady supply of instructions.andO;This unit performs all the branch, interrupt and condition code instructions,and it has six registers: machine state, save, restore, condition, link andcount.andP;  The branch processor handles the seven branch instructions and ninecondition-register instructions of the RISC System/6000 instruction set.andM;The branch processor unit can fetch four instructions per cycle from theinstruction cache and can also dispatch four instructions per cycle, twointernally (branch and condition-register instructions) and one each to thefloating-and fixed-point units.andM;The instruction cache unit is connected to both the floating-and fixed-pointunits by two 64-bit data buses; a 12-position instruction buffer sits betweenthe instruction cache unit and the floating-and fixed-point units.andP;  Eightpositions of this buffer contain sequential instructions for dispatch to thefloating-and fixed-point units, and the other four positions hold prefetchedbranch target instructions.andP;  If the branch is taken, these four positions arewritten to the sequential buffer and dispatched for execution in turn.andM;The instruction cache and floating-and fixed-point units operateindependently of one another in large part, though this independence isrestricted if there are inter-instruction dependencies or pending interrupts.andO;The floating-and fixed-point units are also restricted in that thefloating-point unit cannot get ahead of the fixed-point unit by more than sixinstructions, and the fixed-point unit cannot get ahead of the floating-pointunit by more than two instructions.andM;The fised-point unit executes the 79 fixed-point and logical instructions and55 data reference instructions of the RISC System/6000 instruction set.andP;  Ithas 32 32-bit general-purpose registers and five special-purpose registers.andO;The instruction set is a comparatively rich one, including support forreferences to misaligned operands and, most interestingly, five stringinstructions to copy and compare null-terminated and length-specifiedstrings.andM;The floating-point unit has 32 64-bit registers and one status and controlregister.andP;  The floating-point unit supports 13 arithmetic instructions, sixstatus and control register instructions, and two floating-point compareinstructions.andM;A few of the more interesting instructions in the floating-point unit are thefour multiply/add instructions that multiply two operands, add the product toa third operand and store the result in a fourth operand with a singlerounding error.andP;  (Performing the same operations with multiple instructionswould possibly introduce multiple rounding errors.)andM;The multiply/add instruction is behind IBM's occasional claims that theRISC-System/6000 executes four instructions per clock cycle; IBM likes tocount this instruction as two instructions.andP;  The effects of this multiply/addinstruction are evident in a number of DR Labs' CPU 2 benchmark kernels.andP;  Forkernels such as LINPAC, LAMAPR, LUDD and LUSD, the RISC System/6000 machinesperformed at two to four times the power of their rated geometric means.andM;The data cache chip is a four-way, set-associative, 64KB store-back cachewith a synchronous 128-bit interface to main memory.andP;  (In the Powerstationand Powerserver 320 and 520, the data cache is 32KB with a 64-bit memoryinterface.)andP;  It has a 64-bit path to the floating-point unit, a 32-bit pathto the fixed-point chip, a 64-bit path to the instruction cache and a 64-bitpath to the storage control unit.andP;  The directories, status arrays andtranslation look-ahead (or look-aside) buffer for the data cache are in thefixed-point unit.andM;The data cache unit uses cache reload buffers that let the CPU access cachedata before an entire 128-byte cache line is brought in from main memory; ona cache miss, the line is brought into the cache reload buffer first and madeimmediately available to the floating-or fixed-point unit, and then loadedinto the cache.andM;The data cache supports memory scrubbing, double-bit error detection andsingle-bit error correction, and bit steering.andP;  The unit accomplishes memoryscrubbing by periodically passing through all the memory locations andcorrecting any correctable errors before they accumulate and possibly becomeuncorrectable errors.andP;  Bit steering is a technique by which the data cacheunit substitutes a good bit for a bad one that has been brought in frommemory.andM;The storage control unit arbitrates all communication between the CPU complex(instruction cache unit, fixed-point unit and data cache unit), main memoryand the I/O subsystem.andP;  This unit is the bus master for the memory and systemI/O bus, and it manages much of the interaction between the systemcomponents.andM;The RISC System/6000's main memory is four-way interleaved so that it canprovide 64 bits of data every machine cycle.andP;  Each memory card can have 8MB,16MB or 32MB of memory (or, with the Powerserver 540's 4Mbit dynamic RAM,64MB).andP;  Each memory card also includes two data-multiplexing chips and acontrol chip, and can buffer four instructions and 16 words of write data.andM;The serial link and system bus adapter contains an I/O channel controllerthat provides the Micro Channel interface, and two serial-link adapters thatfunction as an interface to two 220Mbit-per-second fiber-optic links.andP;  Theselinks can be almost 1.25 miles long.andP;  Although these fiber-optic links arenot yet implemented in the RISC System/6000, IBM has indicated it will usethem in the future for high-speed data storage and multiprocessing.andM;The Micro Channel bus includes some enhancements, the most important of whichis the data streaming procedure.andP;  Data is transferred in a stream; only theaddress of the data is required at the beginning of the stream, and the restof the data follows contiguously.andP;  This feature, according to IBM officials,boosts the peak Micro Channel bandwidth to 40MB per second, and thesustainable bandwidth to between 20MB and 25MB per second.andM;Drives that are currently available for the RISC System/6000 are all SCSI,and a SCSI Micro Channel adapter comes with all packaged systems.andP;  Incontrast to other workstation vendors that include an Ethernet interface, IBMdoesn't offer the RISC System/6000 systems with any networking hardware.andO;Customers must specifically order Ethernet, Token-Ring or X.25 Micro Channeladapters.andP;  It is especially strange that the Powerserver packages do not comewith LAN hardware.andM;All the systems come with a 1.44MB 3-1/2-inch internal micro floppy diskdrive.andP;  The Powerstation and Powerserver 320 have a directly attached 120MBdisk drive and can accomodate one additional 3-1/2-inch disk drive.andP;  ThePowerserver and Powerstation 520 and 530 each come with one 355MB 5-1/4-inchdisk drive and can accommodate two additional 5-1/4-inch drives.andM;Alternatively, a maximum of six 3-1/2-inch disk drives can be installed inpairs; each pair occupies the same space as one 5-1/4-inch drive.andP;  The diskdrives available include a 355MB 5-1/4-inch drive, a bundled pair of3-1/2-inch drives that provide 640MB, a 670MB 5-1/4-inch drive and an 857MB5-1/4-inch drive.andM;External SCSI storage is available for all the units.andM;Each 520 and 530 has three half-height bays in its enclosure for either aCD-ROM drive or a 2.3GB 8mm tape drive.andP;  The 320 offers the option of havingthese drives installed externally.andM;All the units have two serial ports and one parallel printer port.andP;  A bevy ofasynchronous adapters for various terminals and printers are also available.andM;Three graphics options are available for each Powerstation except the 730.andO;The monitors for all these adapters must be purchased separately.andM;At the low end is the Grayscale Graphics Display Adapter, which at $1,395drives a 19-inch monochrome monitor and provides a 1,280-line-by-1,024-pixel,67Hz non-interlaced display of 16 concurrent shades of gray from a palette of256.andP;  The adapter has four bit planes and a two-plane cursor.andP;  This PC ATform-factor card takes up one Micro Channel slot.andM;The Color Graphics Display Adapter, priced at $2,225, supports1,280-line-by-1,024-pixel, 60Hz analog monitors (16-, 19- and 23-inch) andprovides 256 simultaneous colors from a palette of 16.7 million.andP;  It haseight bit planes and a programmable two-plane cursor.andP;  It also occupies oneMicro Channel slot.andM;The High-Performance 8-Bit 3-D Color Graphics Adapter, which lists for$4,000, is similar to the Color Graphics Display Adapter but providesexpandability and a much higher level of performance.andM;A 24-bit Z-buffer Solid Rendering option, priced at $3,000, and a 24-BitColor Graphics Frame Buffer upgrade for $6,500 are also available for it.andM;With this upgrade and option, the adapter has 8-bit, 12-bit and 24-bit colormodes; a 24-bit Z-buffer; two or four overlay planes; two or four windowcontrol planes; support for arbitrarily shaped windows; and support formulticolored, local and infinite light sources.andP;  Customers have a choice ofdiffuse, ambient or specular lighting models.andM;This configuration also offers flat and Gouraud shading, dithered RGBshading, anti-aliased lines, backface polygon removal, six-axis clipping,depth cueing, image pan and zoom, a programmable two-plane cursor, andinteger and 32-bit floating-point coordinate systems.andP;  (The more basic modelshave only integer coordinate systems).andM;Finally, IBM plans to release the Hig-Performance 24-Bit 3D Color GraphicsAdapter sometime this quarter.andP;  This option bundles the frame buffer upgradewith the previously described model, offering 24-bit true color and 16 setsof 256 simultaneous colors.andM;The RISC System/6000 runs AIX, IBM's version of Unix.andP;  The machines we testedwere running version 3.1.andP;  AIS is based on Unix System V Released 2 andincludes 4.3BSD Unix compatibility.andP;  It also conforms to the 1988 Posix IEEE1003.1 specification.andM;AIX has just about everything one expects in a Unix system these days, andthen some.andP;  It has TCP/IP, NFS and NCS as well as shared libraries, and itcan boot remote diskless Sun-3 and Sun-4 workstations.andP;  (The RISCSystem/6000s cannot as yet run as diskless workstations.)andP;  The usual Unixtool set is there, from the Bourne, C and Korn shells to vi and IBM's INededitor.andM;We found AIX's menu-based System Management Interface tool to be more helpfuland easier to use than other menu-based system management programs we'veencountered.andM;AIX manages physical disk space by implementing logical volumes that can spanmultiple physical disks and are dynamic in size.andP;  According to IB, officials,this logical-volume scheme will support mirroring--whereby one logical volumeis an exact duplicate of another, increasing reliability and responsetime--by year's end.andM;For real-time laboratory and process-control applications, where workstationsare finding a home, AIX offers a number of features not now found in DEC'sUltrix.andP;  AIX provides enhanced real-time support, including 128 processpriorities, 20 ow which are for real-time user processes; preemptivedispatching of processes; a pre-emptable kernel; and timer control to aresolution of 10 times the processor cycle.andM;An optimizing C compiler is included.andP;  Fortran, Pascal and Cobol compilersare also available from IBM.andP;  Other languages are available or expectedshortly from third-party vendors.andM;Although much has been made of IBM's licensing of NextStep, a GUI and GUIbuilder from Next Computer, NextStep is not yet available.andP;  We used the AIXwindows Environment/6000, IBM's name for OSF/Motif, for a GUI.andP;  Of theOSF/Motif applications included with the system, the only one we used was thexde front end to the dbx debugger.andM;AIX includes one-byte national language support for Western languages as wellas optional Shifted-Japanese Industry Standard, available only in Japan, andthe double-Byte Character Set for Japanese Kanji.andM;Users can set national language sustitution on a per-process basis.andP;  Clibrary subroutines are available for processing extended characters fornational language support.andP;  It's possible to define messages, panels andprompts separately from applications so that translation can be useds withoutmodifying source code.andM;DEC, Sun and the Apollo Division of Hewlett-Packard would do well toconsolidate their positions in the coming months.andP;  Granted, some in theindustry have voiced doubts about the Micro Channel bus' ability to supportthe RISC System/6000 series adequately, and competitors quickly point to therelatively small number of applications now available.andP;  But there is littlequestion that the superscalar design of the Power architecture deliversexemplary CPU performance, and the pricing of all this compute power putsothers to shame.andM;TRULY SECOND-GENERATION RISCandM;A standing rule in MIS shops has always bee,&quot;You can't get fired for buyingIBM.&quot;andP;  now that IBM has something for us to really salivate over, thepressure on the other workstation vendors is going to be speciallysignificant.andM;IBM has finally delivered a real, true-to-life technical workstation with areal, true-to-life RISC processor.andP;  More than a decade after IBM exploredRISC with the never-released 801, and four years after the release of thatcasualty of benign neglect, the RT/PC, IBM has designed a series that trulycan be called second-generation RISC technology.andM;TEST MODELandM;Because the IBM RISC System/6000 workstations and servers are directed at thetechnical and scientific markets, their CPU power must be substantial.andM;To gauge how well the series satisfies this requirement, we used our CPU 2benchmark suite to test two of the family's four workstations, thePowerstation 320 and 530, as well as one of the series' five servers, thePowerserver 540.andM;The CPU suite evaluates a system and its Fortran compiler's ability to handleoperations typically required of scientific and engineering applications.andO;The suite's results reflect the raw speed of the CPU, the efficiency of theFortran compiler and, to a lesser extent, the speed of memory access.andM;Because many workstation applications are extremely graphics-intensive, wealso evauated the X Windows System performance of the Powerstation 320 and530 using the X11 version 1.2 benchmark suite.andP;  The X11 perf test carries oura wide range of common X windows operations, which we categorize as generalgraphics, terminal emulation, window management and X-specific operations.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
