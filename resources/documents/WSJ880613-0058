The biggest issue -- which hasn't even been formally discussed since the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries opened the conference Saturday -- involves the cartel's production ceiling for the rest of this year.    Meanwhile, the ministers have become deadlocked over the very definition of &quot;oil production,&quot; as used in calculating quotas for the 13 member nations. This split has pitted Venezuela, supported by seven other OPEC members, against the five Persian Gulf Arab members.    &quot;We are going to have some bilateral discussions to try to have a consensus for definitions,&quot; said Arturo Hernandez Grisanti, Venezuela's oil minister, after yesterday's two-hour session. &quot;It is not easy to have a consensus,&quot; he said, &quot;because it is technically a complex problem.&quot;    The issue of reducing, maintaining or increasing the cartel's production ceiling has divided the ministers along the same lines as the production-definition issue, with a majority of eight clearly in favor of some action to prop up weak oil prices. There were indications yesterday, however, that several countries that had favored production cuts are willing to let quotas remain where they are -- for at least the third quarter.    &quot;We would change nothing,&quot; said one minister, &quot;but would come back in September to decide on the fourth quarter.&quot; An Arab delegate said continuing the present quotas for the entire second half has &quot;a 60% to 70% probability.&quot;    At a time of weak world-wide oil markets, further delays in setting production quotas for the second half could drive down oil prices even further, said some oil company officials in Vienna for the meeting. On Friday, doubts about the effectiveness of the meeting in curbing excess production sent the spot price of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, tumbling 30 cents a barrel, to $16.75.    &quot;Each day's delay costs them 25 cents a barrel,&quot; said the chief economist of one major oil company.    The side issue of defining oil &quot;production&quot; has political overtones, pitting Venezuela against Saudi Arabia and Kuwait -- three nations at odds over a number of other issues in OPEC. The contention involves Venezuela's definition of condensates, which are light, oil-like liquids excluded from OPEC production quotas. There are other definition issues, as well, such as the crude oil that is &quot;lost&quot; during processing -- oil that Venezuela also excludes from its quotas.    Venezuela, for its part, is pressing the Arab countries -- particularly Saudi Arabia and Kuwait -- to count oil produced in the so-called Neutral Zone as &quot;production&quot; for quota-setting purposes. The Neutral Zone is an area of land administered by Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. This oil, produced as war-relief crude for Iraq, normally would be included in the Iraqi quota under OPEC rules. But Iraq refuses to accept a quota unless the allotments equals the 2.4 million barrels a day of Iran, its war foe.    As a result, Neutral Zone production of more than 300,000 barrels a day escapes the OPEC quota system and is likely to remain controversial until Iraq is brought back into the system.    The quotas of the 12 members of OPEC other than Iraq total 15.1 million barrels a day. If Iraq were included with a quota equal to Iran's, the total would be 17.5 million barrels daily. But current production of OPEC, including Iraq, is more than 18 million barrels a day.    The Iranians have bitterly opposed quota parity for Iraq. But they have been very low-key at this meeting, closeting themselves in the Intercontinental Hotel much of yesterday. As the morning session broke up, Iran's oil minister, Gholamreza Aqazadeh, was asked what he would like to see emerge from the talks. He replied: &quot;To improve the prices (and) to curb overproduction of other countries.&quot;    At the opening session Saturday, Rilwanu Lukman, Nigeria's oil minister, was re-elected OPEC president despite his reported reluctance to continue in that capacity as long as the cartel is operating without a secretary general. However, the Indonesia delegation plans to nominate Subroto, that country's former oil minister, as the new secretary general, who probably would be approved by the others.    Mana Said Otaiba, the United Arab Emirates oil minister, had been mentioned as the possible new president. He has held the position three times in the past and was believed eager to head OPEC again. He left early from the short morning session and then, late yesterday, departed from Vienna, saying he had to consult with his government. </TEXT></DOC>
