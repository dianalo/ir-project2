With the exception of funds that invest only in Treasuryand government agency securities, money funds open toindividual investors shrank during the third quarter, figurescompiled by the Donoghue Organization show.</LP><TEXT>   And any investors hoping for a quick end to decliningyields are in for a disappointment.   &quot;So long as there's no life in the consumer sector -- andthere is no life in the consumer sector -- rates are going tokeep going down,&quot; says Walter Frank, Donoghue's chiefeconomist. Short-term interest rates could fall half apercentage point over the next few months, he says, pushingmoney-fund yields below 5% for the first time since 1977.   The average seven-day compound yield for all taxable fundsis currently 5.29%, the lowest in more than a decade,according to Donoghue, a Holliston, Mass., firm that tracksmoney funds. Compound yields assume reinvestment ofdividends. The overall average includes funds open only toinstitutions, which typically have higher yields than thoseopen to individuals.   The third-quarter average yield for funds open toindividuals was 5.28%, compared with 5.57% for the secondquarter, according to annualized yield calculations byDonoghue's that don't take into account the effects ofcompounding.   Even the top-yielding funds currently offer compoundreturns of barely more than 6%.   In an effort to slow the yield decline, fund managers havestretched the average maturity of the taxable funds'investments to 61 days -- the longest in more than a decade.Money-fund investments include commercial paper (short-termcorporate IOUs), Treasury bills and bank certificates ofdeposit. Most of today's top-yielding funds have portfoliomaturities that are even longer than 61 days.   But many discouraged investors aren't waiting to see justhow far and how fast money-fund yields will fall. They'vebeen putting their money elsewhere.   After two years of double-digit growth, increases inmoney-fund assets have slowed nearly to a halt, and somefunds are reporting declines. Assets of funds open toindividual investors have fallen about $5 billion since theend of the second quarter -- to $334.5 billion for taxablefunds -- and fund managers expect further outflows as yieldsdecline.   Some of the cash that isn't going into money funds isclearly going into bond funds. Just last week, the InvestmentCompany Institute reported that almost $7 billion poured intobond funds in August alone.   The exception to the stagnation in money-fund growth isthe &quot;government-only&quot; category. According to Donoghue,investors added about $2 billion to such funds during thequarter, raising the total to $77 billion.   For now, investors aren't giving up much yield for theadded safety of these funds. Their average seven-day compoundyield this week is 5.19%, a tenth of a percentage point lowerthan the average for all taxable funds, and income from fundsthat invest only in Treasurys is generally exempt from stateand local taxes. There are three government funds among thequarter's top 10 taxable funds.   The top-yielding funds have a few things in common. Eightof the top 10 are currently waiving part of their expenses,which has the effect of boosting yield. Most also havelonger-than-average maturities. Indeed, Olde Premium MoneyMarket Series, which ranks second for the third quarter, hasan average maturity of 88 days, close to the 90-day maximumpermitted under Securities and Exchange Commissionregulations.   But there also are some significant differences among thetop funds. Some of those funds are among the largest --Dreyfus Worldwide Dollar with assets of nearly $9 billion andFidelity Spartan with assets of just under $6 billion. Butthere also are some small funds -- Alger Money MarketPortfolio has just $159 million in assets.   Even some of the top funds showed declines in assetsduring the quarter. Fidelity Spartan, for instance, hadassets of about $6.7 billion at the end of the secondquarter. Fidelity is coping with asset outflows by &quot;trying tostay as liquid as possible in a liquid environment,&quot; saysNeal Litvack, marketing vice president. The Fidelity fundshave increased their investments in Treasurys, for instance,which he says &quot;are as liquid as you can get.&quot;   Other funds have different strategies. Joseph DiMartino,president of Dreyfus Corp., says investments in WorldwideDollar form &quot;a barbell rather than a ladder,&quot; with maturitiesat both the short and long ends. There's more than enoughmaturing every day to meet redemptions, he says.   Some funds see a silver lining. &quot;Up until four or fivemonths ago, we were having trouble finding sufficientsecurities that met our quality standards,&quot; says IanMacKinnon, senior vice president of Vanguard Group. &quot;We lookat the shrinkage in cash flows as beneficial.&quot; Vanguard'sMoney Market Reserve Prime fund now has almost half itsassets in dollar-denominated European bank obligations, hesays, because credit ratings agencies have downgraded so manyU.S. banks.   Many funds upgraded the credit quality of theirinvestments during the third quarter, followingimplementation of new SEC regulations last June. The newguidelines, imposed after commercial-paper defaults forcedseveral mutual fund companies to buy the defaulted paper fromtheir money funds to avoid shareholder losses, limit funds'holdings in less than top-quality paper to a maximum 5% oftheir total portfolio.   Only 12 funds of the 405 open to individual investorsreported holding any such &quot;second-tier&quot; paper at the end ofthe third quarter, compared with 21 funds, out of a total of394, at the end of June. All the current holdings are belowthe 5% limit, and several funds have said they plan to phaseout second-tier paper entirely.   ---               Monitoring Money-Market Funds                                                                                                          A look at consumer-oriented money funds and some of theirholdings at the end of the third quarter.
