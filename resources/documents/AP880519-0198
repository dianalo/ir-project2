The debate centers on a geologic event that occurred at what iscalled the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary. This rock formation, laiddown about 66 million years ago, marks some event that culminatedin a major extinction of plants and animals. Among the creatureswiped out during, or perhaps just before, this era were thedinosaurs.   In 1980, a group of scientiests at the University of California,Berkeley, led by Luis Alvarez, proposed that the extinctions werecaused by the impact on Earth of a massive meteorite. The impact,they suggested, vaporized the space boulder and threw vast amountsof fine material into the atmosphere. This material shaded the sunand caused plants to die, disrupting the food chain and wiping outhundreds of species.   A competing theory proposes that the extinctions were caused byvolcanic eruptions that darkened the sun. The action caused a majorchange in the Earth's weather, created a vast amount of acid rainand diminished the ozone layer of the atmosphere.   Scientists favoring the volcano theory have proposed that thekiller volcano was in what is now India and formed a lava depositcalled the Deccan, a formation that covers thousands of miles to adepth of hundreds of feet.   In a paper presented to the geophysical union, VincentCourtillot of the Institute of Geophysics in Paris, said thatsamples of the Deccan show that it was laid down at about the timeof the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary. This supports the contention,Courtillot said, that the volcano occurred at the time of the majorextinctions.   ``This is an important finding for the vulcanism side of thedebate,'' said Charles Officer of Dartmouth. ``There are fivestudies now that show the Deccan formed during the time of theextinctions 64 to 69 million years ago.''   But proponents of the impact theory said the volcano studies donot explain the presence at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary of anelement called iridium. This element is rare in ordinaryformations, but is found in abundance at the CT boundary. Iridiumalso is found in abundance in meteorites.   Courtillot admitted Thursday that iridium is not found in theDeccan   Orth, however, said he has found an abundance of iridium atformations he studied all over the American Southwest.   In areas such as the Raton Basin in New Mexico, theCretaceous-Tertiary deposits have lain almost undisturbed for 66million years. Samples show a clear, clean and significant level ofiridium precisely where the Alvarez theory said it should be, hesaid.   ``That iridium is not native,'' Orth said. ``It had to fall infrom somewhere.'' And the most likely source is from comets ormeteorites that fell to Earth 66 million years ago, he said.   Orth said he first favored the volcano theory of extinction, butfeels the growing body of evidence ``now favors the impact theory.''   But both sides, he said, still have fundamental flaws thatcannot be resolved yet.   ``More study is needed,'' said Orth, ``but it's something thatwill be argued for many, many years.''</TEXT></DOC>
