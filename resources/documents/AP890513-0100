Gen. Prosper Avril has firedtwo widely criticized Cabinet ministers in his first high-levelpersonnel move since rank-and-file soldiers brought him to powereight months ago.   The government decree, read Saturday on state radio, came lessthan six weeks after the Haitian leader narrowly escaped an attemptby some officers to oust him.   The two Cabinet members, Foreign Affairs Minister Serge Charlesand Information Minister Anthony Saint-Pierre, caused a publicoutcry for their role in granting a safe conduct pass out of Haitiin December to former Mayor Franck Romain. Romain was indicted formasterminding the massacre of at least 12 parishioners in a slumchurch.   The Sept. 11 massacre outraged soldiers and spurred the ousterof former ruler Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy a week later. Both Namphy andRomain now live in the neighboring Dominican Republic.   Namphy ruled this impoverished Caribbean nation after dictatorJean-Claude Duvalier fled to France in 1986. Namphy turned overpower to civilian Leslie Manigat in February 1988 but deposedManigat in June.   Opposition leaders have persistently demanded the removal ofSaint-Pierre, considered one of Avril's most influential advisers.   In a memorandum to Avril leaked to the press in January,Saint-Pierre encouraged the government to repress ``perhaps withbloodshed'' the Peasant Movement of Papaye in central Haiti, whichhe accused of subversion.   The decree announcing the Cabinet changes, dated Friday, wasread by state-run Radio Nationale, privately owned Radio Metropoleand Radio Soleil, run by the Roman Catholic Church.   The decree said the new information minister was Ms. RosemarieNazon, Avril's sister-in-law and previously a civil servant in theministry.   It said the new foreign affairs minister was Yvon Perrier,formerly the ministry's general director.   Soldiers loyal to Avril blocked an attempted coup bypro-Duvalierist army officers on April 2. The ringleaders wereexiled to the United States. The coup attempt came four days afterAvril fired four officers accused of drug-running.   A crackdown on drug trafficking in the army is one of theconditions for the resumption of U.S. aid.   The United States suspended $60 million of a $90 million annualaid package after thugs protected by soldiers massacred at least 34voters at polling stations during elections on Nov. 29, 1987. Thoseelections were canceled.   Avril has pledged to allow free elections, though not for atleast two years, and has partially restored Haiti's 1987constitution.</TEXT></DOC>
