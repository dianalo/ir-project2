Primerica said it expected to complete the Musicland sale in thesecond quarter of 1988.   A one-time, after-tax gain of $130 million was anticipated as aresult of the leveraged buyout of Musicland by an investor groupheaded by Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette and Musicland's seniormanagement, Primerica said in a statement.
