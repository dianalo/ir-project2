(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Civil rights leaders said Wednesdaythey've made progress in this northeast Florida city, but themailing of a bomb to NAACP headquarters recalls recent racialtensions that had begun to fade.   The bomb disarmed here Tuesday was similar to devices whichkilled a federal appeals court judge and a Savannah, Ga., civilrights leader.   Bombs mailed to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta andto the Jacksonville office of the National Association for theAdvancement of Colored People were disarmed without causing anydamage or injuries.   Possible links to NAACP school desegregation efforts have beenidentified in all four cases, leading to theories that a racistgroup may be responsible.   Racial tensions were heightened here in September when threeblack City Council members were ordered arrested after they walkedout of a meeting to protest lack of funding for predominantly blackareas in the city budget.   One of them, attorney Deitra Micks, was arrested in a City Hallwomen's room and hauled back to the council meeting in handcuffs.The arrests were ordered by City Council President Tillie Fowler,who is white, so the council would have a quorum.   ``And all of a sudden this happened, so it just brings up thiswhole issue of race again,'' the Rev. John Newman, a blackminister, said Wednesday. ``Jacksonville is sitting on a racialpowder keg, I'm sorry to report.''   Black leaders said they were angry about Tuesday's discovery ofthe bomb, but it will not deter them from their work.   ``We will go on with our business as usual. We will not let thisincident stop us from doing the job we have set out to do,'' saidWillye Dennis, the local president of the NAACP. She received theexplosive package Monday, but didn't have time to open it then.   She had a more optimistic view of racial tension in the city.   ``We've come a long way in Jacksonville, but we have a long wayto go,'' she said.   City Council member Terry Wood, who is white, said he believestensions have eased since the walkout. ``But there are elements onboth sides who can point to certain events and say improvements aresuperficial,'' said Wood.   Newman, pastor of the Mount Calvary Baptist Church, said theorganization has received criticism from both whites and blacks forits positions.   ``On one hand we have threats from whites, perhaps racists, whowant to destroy us because of positions of ideology ... and on theother hand, to try to stop drugs we have threats from blacks whohappened to be drug dealers who want to blow us away,'' Newman said.   The FBI said Wednesday that all four bombs had Georgia postmarksor return addresses.   FBI agent William Hinshaw, in charge of the Atlanta office, saidthe first parcel bomb, addressed to federal Judge Robert S. Vance,was mailed last Thursday from Newnan, Ga., to Vance's home inMountain Brook, Ala., a suburb of Birmingham. Vance was killed andhis wife was seriously injured.   The bomb that killed Savannah, Ga., alderman and attorney RobertE. Robinson on Monday is believed to have been mailed Friday fromMacon, Hinshaw said. The bomb found in Jacksonville also was mailedFriday from Macon, he said.   Another bomb was mailed Saturday from the Atlanta area to the11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals clerk's office in Atlanta,Hinshaw said.   The investigation is concentrating in part on possible links toNAACP school desegregation efforts:   _ The 11th Circuit hears federal appeals from Georgia, Floridaand Alabama, including desegregation cases.   _ Vance, an 11th Circuit judge, wrote the court's Septemberruling in favor of the Jacksonville NAACP in its desegregation suitagainst Jacksonville schools.   _ Robinson was the Savannah NAACP's local counsel and helpedwith an NAACP suit against the Savannah schools. The NAACP lostthat case at the 11th Circuit, and the three-judge panel did notinclude Vance.   _ Robinson also had advised the Jacksonville NAACP chapter inits desegregation case, according to a Jacksonville activist, theRev. Fred Newbill.</TEXT></DOC>
