Bennett LeBow, is still trying to gobble up Prime Computer.andP;  Obviously, nocompany or sector of the economy is safe from Wall Street's takeover sharksthese days.andM;But don't let this episode delude you into thinking that the takeover artistsare interested only in computer industry giants.andP;  With their stocks tradingat attractively low prices, small information systems companies make equallyjuicy takeover targets.andM;If a Wall Street marauder comes sniffing around your company, is thereanything you can do to prevent a hostile takeover?andP;  You bet! In this columnand the next, I'll give you some ideas for keeping the takeover artists atbay.andM;First, you should determine if there's truly a reason to panic by takingfollowing test.andP;  If you answer &quot;yes&quot; to at least half of these questions, youcan assume that your company is a sitting duck for a takeover:andM;* Does the company hold a key position in the computer industry?andM;* Does the company offer a unique product or service?andM;* Does the company have above-average growth potential?andM;* Are the company's assets understated?andM;* Does the company have a high liquidity?andM;* Does the company have a low price/earnings multiple?andM;* Does the stock trade at below its book value?andM;* Does the company have serious, perennial employee problems?andM;* Is management out of touch with industry changes?andM;* Are stockholders frustrated and dissatisfied with management's policies?andM;* Has the company been the target of previous takeover attempts?andM;If you scored poorly on this little quiz, you need to know how takeoverartists operate.andM;A takeover attempt begins with a &quot;suitor&quot; targeting several companies withinthe same industry and then zeroing in on one whose stock trades below bookvalue.andP;  After selecting the target, the suitor starts purchasing large blocksof that company's stock.andM;To throw the target company off the scent, the takeover artist carries outthe stock purchases through &quot;nominee accounts&quot; in the names of associates orfront organizations.andP;  This way, the suitor can control the stock-buyingtransactions without having to bank the money in his or her own account.andM;Once the stock purchases reach the legal 5 percent threshold, the suitor mustreport them to the U.S.andP;  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).andP;  In theSEC paperwork, the takeover artist states the purpose for buying the stock invery general terms.andM;If all goes as planned, the takeover artist successfully buys a large chunkof the target company's stock, thus gaining a powerful voice in the company'saffairs.andP;  now he or she can begin to put pressure on management forconcessions.andM;For instance, the takeover artist might ask management to yield one or moreseats on the board of directors; the suitor may then propose its own slate ofcandidates for the board.andP;  The suitor may also try to pressure management toapprove a merger, or even to liquidate the company.andP;  (In the event of a&quot;feigned takeover,&quot; management will get the chance to buy off the suitor atthe so-called right price.)andM;At first, the suitor generally tries to woo the target company into makingthe required concessions.andP;  He or she may attempt to win over other largestockholders, perhaps by offering them high prices for their stock.andM;Takeovers are unsavory affairs, however, so it's hardly suprising thattakeover artists sometimes resort to slimy tactics to force the targetcompany to give in to their demands.andM;Hiring private detectives to get the dirt on key officers of the targetcompany is common.andP;  If the private eyes turn up any skeletons in managementclosets, the takeover artist may use blackmail, threaten a criminalinvestigation or mount a publicity campaign to discredit the key officers inthe eyes of the stockholders.andM;Still not sure whether your company is a potential takeover target?andP;  Here aresome indicators to watch for:andM;* unusual trading activity in the company's stock that is not connected toany internal company developments;andM;* unexplained price fluctuations in the stock;andM;* trades carried out by unknown persons; andandM;* trading concentrated in one or two geographic areas.andM;Be especially careful if these things have been going on when there's been nopublic takeover bid, and pay attention to rumors that trading floorspecialists pick up from the Wall Street grapevine.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
