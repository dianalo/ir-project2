The widespread perception among officers of favoritismundercut attempts to impose discipline and set standards of conduct within thedepartment.;   Now, investigators for both the FBI and the district attorneysay the widening schisms within the department have given them their bestopportunity to build cases against individual officers that prosecutors may bewilling to take to trial.;   At the same time, Burnham Matthews, the city'senergetic new police chief, has revamped the department's discreditedprocedures for investigating misconduct. He already has backed up his toughnew approach by disciplining one officer.;   The efforts come none too soon.The grand jury's report recommended the East Palo Alto Police Department bedisbanded if the problems cannot be corrected quickly.;   &quot;We're cautiouslyoptimistic that the citizens of East Palo Alto will be getting a better dealout of their police department,&quot; said an FBI agent who asked not to beidentified. &quot;They deserve competent cops just as much as the citizens ofAtherton or Woodside.&quot;;   But some officers who are targets of renewed effortsby prosecutors say they are the victims of an orchestrated vendetta by otherofficers in the department. Those officers, they say, have deflected inquiriesinto their own conduct by helping investigators build cases against theircolleagues.;   And they contend the fact they are black and their accusers arewhite has fueled the campaign against them. In East Palo Alto, a traditionallyblack enclave with a growing Hispanic population, such claims can beexplosive. The grand jury's report simply noted that &quot;racial and politicalovertones add to the difficulty&quot; of investigating the department.;   Officerfaces hearing;   Acting Lt. Rahn Sibley, the city's former acting policechief, was acquitted this month on an assault charge stemming from anallegation that he punched a handcuffed prisoner in a police station holdingcell. But he still faces a hearing this week on the department'srecommendation that he be fired for his actions.;   Also this week, the U.S.attorney in San Francisco is expected to present testimony to a federal grandjury, seeking an indictment of former acting Sgt. Benny Pugh, who resigned inSeptember. Last May, Pugh allegedly beat one man with his nightstick andpunched another man who was handcuffed in separate incidents on one night.;  &quot;I'm wondering why it's me and Sibley and not the others, when the others arefar worse,&quot; Pugh said in an interview last week. He denied that he usedexcessive force in either incident.;   Both Pugh and David Washington,Sibley's attorney and a former police officer in East Palo Alto, said thedriving force behind the complaints against Pugh and Sibley is Sgt. NickBennett, the longtime president of the East Palo Alto Police Officers'Association.;   Bennett, who is white, denied that he orchestrated either thePugh or Sibley investigations, but makes no secret that he supports the recentefforts to clean house.;   &quot;(Excessive force) has been condoned or swept underthe carpet in the past,&quot; Bennett said in an interview. &quot;It's been allowed tooccur. There was no command, there was no accountability, none whatsoever.&quot;;  Calls at home;   After the incidents involving Pugh last May, Bennett said,other officers called him at home for advice on whom to contact about whatthey had seen. He said he shared their distrust of the department's internalaffairs procedures and gave the officers the telephone numbers ofinvestigators with both the district attorney's office and the FBI.;   &quot;Theydidn't trust the chain of command,&quot; Bennett said.;   Pugh said he is ready todetail misconduct within the department if it becomes necessary for hisdefense. For example, he said, he witnessed a half-dozen incidents at whichBennett was present when excessive force was used but Bennett took no actionto stop it. Bennett acknowledged he was reprimanded in one such case, butdenied there were other incidents.;   Bennett also led a team of officers whoconducted numerous &quot;30-minute evictions&quot; -- warrantless raids in whichheroin-dealer suspects were threatened and rousted from apartments inviolation of legal procedures, according to other officers. Chief Matthewsrecently demanded an end to the practice. Bennett acknowledged his role in theraids, but said no rules were broken.;   'Beat and release';   Inside thedepartment, the commonplace use of excessive force has been well known foryears, according to some officers. Former Detective Reginald Brown, who wasfired for using excessive force, said in a 1988 deposition that supervisorscondoned an unofficial policy of &quot;beat and release&quot; -- to physically abusesuspects without arresting them in order to avoid leaving a trail of evidence.Suspects often were brought to the station bloody and beaten, he said.;  Rufus Cole, a San Francisco attorney who has reached out-of-court settlementswith the city in several civil lawsuits alleging police brutality, said he isconvinced the misconduct was condoned by department officials and was notlimited to a few &quot;bad apples.&quot;;   &quot;Based on (police department) internalaffairs files that we were able to examine, I believe there was ample evidencethe higher echelon of officers were not only aware, but participated in, theabuse of arrestees and didn't take any steps,&quot; Cole said.;   Because thedepartment lacked the personnel for a separate internal affairs unit,colleagues were assigned to investigate each other. Some officers hoardeddamaging information on their colleagues as ammunition in case they came underfire themselves.;   The lack of internal discipline in turn made oversight byoutside agencies difficult. The district attorney's office relies on thepolice department to refer cases for criminal prosecution, District AttorneyJames Fox said.;   In addition, he said, prosecutors must rely on policeofficers' cooperation to win convictions in other cases.;   &quot;It is awkward atbest for a prosecuting agency to maintain a relationship with a policedepartment and at the same time prosecute those officers,&quot; Fox said. &quot;Itstrains a working relationship, to say the least.&quot;;   FBI called in;   As aresult, Fox preferred to refer cases of alleged brutality to the FBI, whichinvestigates possible federal civil-rights violations.;   The FBI launched itsfirst investigations of East Palo Alto police officers in 1987, and has spentnearly four years looking into numerous allegations. No indictments have beenreturned.;   With recent developments, that may soon change. FBI officialshave vowed to work closely with Chief Matthews to reform the department.;  &quot;Walking into this awesome and challenging situation, that chief can rely onany effort we can give him,&quot; said Edward J. Appel, the assistantspecial-agent-in-charge of the FBI's San Francisco office. &quot;That includescleaning up old business.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DAVID BANK, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Peninsula/Am  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911215  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,313  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday, December 15, 199100350082,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
