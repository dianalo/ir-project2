Today, Congress is pouring similarfeeling into a fight with President Bush over whether Chinadeserves an extension of its &quot;most-favored-nation&quot; tradingstatus. President Bush wants MFN renewed, arguing in hisspeech at Yale University last Monday that &quot;It is wrong toisolate China if we hope to influence China.&quot; A vocal crowdin Congress says that Mr. Bush is too soft on China, thatthere should be no renewal of MFN without strict human-rightsconditions attached. Senate Majority Leader George Mitchellaccused Mr. Bush recently of a double standard, &quot;one forother nations and another for China.&quot;   No doubt there are parties to this debate who trulyunderstand the disgusting intricacies of China's communistregime and honestly care whether China's 1.1 billion peopleachieve the freedom some died for in 1989. But if America'spolitical leaders want to advance freedom in China, it's timethey began plastering large-character posters on Capitol Hillwith slogans reminding themselves that the matter at hand issupposed to be China, not power games between Congress andthe President.                                                                                                       </LP><TEXT>   Who Should Be Favored                                                                                                          From that base line, there might be a chance of sortingout the real issues. America's puzzle from the beginning hasbeen how to punish China's government for remainingcommunist, while at the same time supporting China's peoplein their desire for freedom. The Chinese communist state hassnaked its way so deeply into most aspects of Chinese privatelife that separating the despots from the repressed is adelicate job. Fortunately, there are finer policy tools forthis task than the baseball-bat thwack of revoking MFN -- ifonly the politicians would stop emoting long enough to think.   Rather than trashing trade, America would do better toreconsider its role in direct handouts to the Chinesegovernment, such as multilateral aid. America would also dobetter to remind Beijing that there are increasinglyattractive rivals in Asia for Washington's favors --especially the fast-reforming Nationalist Chinese governmenton Taiwan.   Among the problems with the MFN approach is that it isperilous for America even in the clearest cases to invoketrade sanctions as tools for the political reform of foreigntrading partners. And in the China MFN debate it is hard totrack the fine line between the lofty moral urge and thedreary self-serving demands of protectionist Congressmanplaying to their local lobbyists.   Well before Tiananmen there was already a protectionistfervor to some of America's dealings with China. The U.S. hasfor years imposed quotas on Chinese garment imports at thebehest of the U.S. textile lobby -- and the expense of theAmerican consumer. Currently there are quotas on such goodsas yarn, fabrics, shoes and umbrellas. American quotas applyalso to many such items made in Hong Kong. These policieshave nothing to do with U.S. concern for human rights or thegeneral prosperity -- except to undermine them.                                                                                                          The Meaning of MFN                                                                                                          A glance at the U.S. tariff schedules confirms thatwithdrawing MFN would hurt the freest parts of China, whichare the small private enterprises along the southern coast.It is important to understand that MFN, despite its name, isnot a status conferred on a favored few. MFN is simply theodd label for routine trading status with the U.S., conferredon all but about a dozen hostile countries such as NorthKorea, Vietnam and the Soviet Union. Any country selling itsgoods into America under MFN is basically competing in theworld market. That means any huge tariff increase for Chinesegoods would translate in effect into a blockade.   Should America withdraw MFN from China, the new tariffschedule applied to Chinese imports would rise mostdrastically for the light consumer goods that make up thebulk of China's sales to the U.S. Tariffs on cotton T-shirtswould rise to 90% from 21%. Tariffs on toys and music boxeswould rise to 70% from 6.8%. Cotton petticoats would take a90% tariff hit, up from 17%.   Manufacturing for the export of such discount-storeproducts is precisely what has in recent years brought awestward-looking boom to the coastal Chinese provinces ofGuangdong -- next to Hong Kong, and Fujien -- across thestrait from Taiwan. Guangdong alone, with some 65 millionpeople or 6% of the Chinese population, accounted last yearfor about $22 billion in sales abroad, or more than one-thirdof China's exports.   Revoking MFN would also deeply damage free-market HongKong, which handles some 70% of China's exports and stands asAsia's greatest monument to the benefits of trade.   Some may consider all this worth the cost if China'sleaders comply with demands to release various jaileddissidents, end slave labor in prison and generally desistfrom the more visibly foul practices that come with thecommunist system. Problem is, that's hostage-politics. Thesignal it sends to Beijing is that it's all right to jail andtorture people, as long as you eventually and publiclyrelease some of them.   The human-rights issue should not be whether China at anygiven moment holds six political prisoners or 60,000, butwhether the government wields the power to jail people atwhim. The Communist Party's control does not depend ondriving tanks through Beijing every day; only on being in aposition to order in the tanks when it feels the urge. Thatmust change if China is truly to reform. For that, it isprobably necessary for the Beijing communist rulers not justto display better manners, but to surrender power.                                                                                                          Better Options                                                                                                          Rather than rant about MFN, perhaps both Congress and theadministration should take another look at policy optionsthat would be felt foremost by the top cadres in Beijing.   A beginning, unorthodox but direct, would be to renew MFN,but rename it. If we're going to send messages with thisdevice, call it Capitalism Requires Democracy status.   A deeper reprimand would be to lobby against multilateralaid and comfort to the Chinese government. The U.S. may notunilaterally control disbursements by the World Bank, theAsian Development Bank and United Nations' charityorganizations, but it has a strong voice. Any funds orprograms these outfits administer must be filtered throughthe control of China's central government, which shores upthe state institutions that do the filtering.   The amounts involved are relatively minor compared withChina's commercial trade. But the mere willingness of theseinstitutions to deal with China provides a seal of approvalthat is grossly inappropriate. The Asian Development Bank,for example, has dumped $11.5 million in technical-assistancegrants into China since the People's Republic joined the ADBin 1986 -- about half of that since Tiananmen -- and isscheduled this month to consider the multimillion-dollarfinancing of a state railway project. The World Bank earlierthis year approved a $168.4 million loan to China to helpimprove living conditions in three Chinese cities.   What would best improve living conditions in Chinesecities would be the disappearance of the communist party.That seems an appropriate measure of when it would make senseto resume the supply of any funds that originate withAmerican taxpayers and flow through the hands of China'sgovernment.                                                                                                          Don't Punish Consumers   Though cutting off a $600,000 grant such as that approvedthis past January by the ADB for &quot;Environmental ImpactAssessment Training&quot; might sound like small stuff, it will befelt immediately by the cadres on the receiving end -- whereit translates into big money. If the aim is to train Chineseofficials, the money could better be spent offeringscholarships to come to the U.S. and return home spirituallypolluted and schooled in the daily ways of a democracy. ForAmericans, taking this approach rather than slamming shuttrade has the added advantage that it doesn't punish U.S.consumers.   If anything, it would either save them tax money, or putit to better use in countries where aid at least stands abetter chance of serving decent ends -- such as the newlynoncommunist countries of Eastern Europe.   Want another productive policy initiative? Lobby loudlyfor the admission of Taiwan ahead of Communist China to boththe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the newlyformed Asian-Pacific Economic Conference. That would leave iteven less ambiguous that America likes to recognize andreward the achievements of democratizing Chinese governments-- but has less time for people who drive tanks throughTiananmen Square.   It may be too much to hope that Congress can resist cheapshots at George Bush over MFN, or that the administrationwould actually throw its full weight into swaying thebureaucrats of the World Bank, ADB and U.N. There would bestiff resistance from the staffers of these organizations --who are important in China only as long as they tender thecommunists money and respect. But by leaving trade to takecare of itself and by focusing directly on Beijing's moreobvious vulnerabilities, the parties to the MFN debate wouldbetter help both China and America, which is presumably thepoint of the exercise.</TEXT></DOC>
