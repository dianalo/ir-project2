Pham Ngoc Quang and the other 6,650 Vietnamese at the camp wantto take the flights to the United States and other Westerncountries. That is why they suffered the long, hazardous journey byboat to Hong Kong.   Hong Kong wants to fly them all back to Vietnam.   Pham, who paid a smuggler eight gold rings for the boat passage,insists he left Vietnam ``not to be fed ... but to find freedom.''   He is among the growing number of Vietnamese who fled theirhomeland not because of political persecution but because ofeconomic hardship. They have overwhelmed refugees facilities in HongKong and elsewhere and prompted demands they be forcibly repatriated.   Pham fought for the army of communist North Vietnam, whoseoverthrow of the U.S.-backed South Vietnam government in April 1975began the boat exodus. More than a million Vietnamese have left, butWestern nations are increasingly reluctant to resettle them.   Boats carrying 369 Vietnamese arrived in Hong Kong on Saturday,bringing arrivals this year to 20,327, compared with 19,000 in 1988,a government spokesman said on condition of anonymity. In all, some44,000 illegal immigrants from Vietnam live in refugee camps in HongKong.   On Friday, local police in Tokyo said 105 people found on awooden boat near a southwestern Japanese island were Vietnamese wholeft home in search of a place where they could ``enjoy a higherstandard of living.''   For 14 years, much of the world considered anyone fleeing Vietnama legitimate refugee, and they were entitled to quick resettlementin the West. But as more peasants flooded out in recent years,officials began considering sending them back.   ``Now many countries are sick of the refugee problem, especiallywhen faced with people who are not real refugees,'' said PrachyadaviTavedikul, deputy spokesman of Thailand's Foreign Ministry.   The anger over boat people is not limited to governments.   About 700 people marched through Hong Kong's Yuen Long districton Sunday to protest the opening in their neighborhood of a new campfor boat people. They called on authorities to stop allowingVietnamese into this British colony.   At an Indochinese refugee conference in Geneva recently, Britainand Hong Kong called for the forced return of those not fleeing forpolitical reasons. Hong Kong Governor David Wilson said this was thehumane course, because they would otherwise continue to sail inunsafe boats only to suffer prolonged detention in camps.   But Vietnam, with Soviet backing, repeated it will not acceptthose forced to return.   The United States said it opposed forced repatriation unlesseconomic, social and political conditions in Vietnam improvedramatically.   The conference did not endorse forced repatriation, but itadopted a plan to screen all new arrivals. The plan called forencouraging voluntary return and said if this did not succeed,alternatives would be examined.   Some officials in Thailand and Malaysia have said privately thatforced repatriation is the only solution and that screeningprocedures don't deter the arrivals.   Under screening procedures adopted by Hong Kong last June, only143 Vietnamese have returned voluntarily, even though the UnitedNations gives financial aid for people to return.   The harsh boat journey and pirate attacks also have not stoppedthe boat people.   According to Suvit Yodmani, Thailand's government spokesman, twoVietnamese women arriving there May 30 said pirates attacked theirboat and killed the other 18 passengers. On June 1, fishermen pickedup three Vietnamese after their boat carrying 40 people capsized,Suvit said.   Hong Kong, Malaysia and Thailand will, however, benefit from thepledges at Geneva to resettle 53,500 Vietnamese refugees over thenext three years. The United States pledged 22,000 places.   In Hong Kong, some relief officials say conditions are worse thanever and government detention sites are inhumane. With no room left,this week 4,500 refugees were living on a remote island in spartan,filthy conditions with no electricity.   Chris Bale, the director of the relief agency Oxfam Hong Kong,said many Vietnamese were suffering psychological problems frombeing confined in camps for years.   Many Vietnamese appeared dejected and listless in the Sham ShuiPo detention center, a former army barracks surrounded by a highmetal wall topped with barbed wire.   Across the street, a billboard advertising American cigarettesfeatures a huge picture of the Statue of Liberty.   In the camps, northern and southern Vietnamese clash and refugeesstage daily hunger strikes to protest their classification asillegal immigrants.   ``Just be careful when you walk by. Some may be very violent,'' agovernment worker warned a reporter visiting Sham Shui Po on Friday.   Bale said few solutions were offered in Geneva to the root of theproblem _ the conditions in Vietnam that prompt flight.   ``We're talking about one of the world's poorest countries,ostracized by the world community for 10 years, still bearing thescars of a very long and bitter war,'' he said.   He urged the United States to free trade and aid for Vietnam bynormalizing diplomatic relations. Washington has said it won't dothat before Vietnam resolves the conflict over its decade-oldmilitary occupation of Cambodia.</TEXT></DOC>
