<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-48-0767 </DOCNO><TEXT>The main feature of the planar gauge, apart from the decoupling of ghosts,is the nontransversatility of the Yang-Mills self-energy with the resultingappearance of a pincer diagram in the Ward identity. The authors employthe general prescription for axial-type gauges, recently developed byone of the authors, to check this Ward identity and derive BRS-invariantcounterterms in the planar gauge.</TEXT></DOC>
