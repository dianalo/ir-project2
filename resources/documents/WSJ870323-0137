He said SAS also wants to determine the outcome of talks that could lead to the liberalization of air travel between the U.S. and Scandinavia.    SAS hopes to receive approval from U.S. authorities to fly to an unlimited number of American destinations, instead of the four U.S. cities it currently can serve. But Mr. Abrahamsson denied that SAS was trying to use the jet order to pressure the U.S.    SAS signed a letter of intent last December to purchase 12 McDonnell Douglas MD-11 jets for an estimated $1.6 billion. But in January it received a proposal from Airbus that it buy the European consortium's A-340 jets. It said then that it would make a final decision by late March.    However, Mr. Abrahamsson said Friday that the decision will be put off for &quot;a number of months.&quot;    The new planes, which would be delivered in the early 1990s, are to replace SAS's fleet of DC-10s, which at decade's end will total 11. </TEXT></DOC>
