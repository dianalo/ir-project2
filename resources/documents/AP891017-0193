They said that elsewhere, rebels have blockaded the 75-milehighway linking Kabul, the capital, to the eastern city ofJalalabad and that the government has launched heavy air attacksand armored assaults trying to open the road.   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said guerrillaforces have moved within three miles of Khost airport. The townlies about 10 miles from the border with Pakistan. Guerrilla groupslong have used Pakistan as a base.   The rebels have been trying for weeks to take the heavilyfortified town. The capture of Khost would allow them to opendirect supply lines to bases in central and northern Afghanistan.   Diplomatic sources, presumably with access to satellitepictures, said photographs show parachutes inside the Khostperimeter. ``There is clear visible evidence of air drops'' bygovernment forces, one diplomat said.   Rebel sources said planes parachuted 44 barrels of fuel abouttwo weeks ago, but eight reached the target and the rest landed inguerrilla-controlled areas.   The last attempt to resupply Khost by land was in December 1987,when 20,000 Soviet soldiers reportedly helped out. The attemptsucceeded after six weeks.   Diplomats said a 200-vehicle convoy left Kabul late last weekand was moving slowly toward Gardez, about 45 miles northwest ofKhost.   Moscow sent more than 103,000 soldiers into Afghanistan in 1979to back up the Marxist government. But the last Soviet soldiersleft last Feb. 15 in keeping with a U.N.-brokered accord.   However, the Soviet Union has airlifted millions of dollars inmilitary aid to the government in Kabul since then, diplomaticsources say.   Washington is a major backer of the Afghan rebels, who have beenfighting for more than a decade to oust successive communistgovernments.</TEXT></DOC>
