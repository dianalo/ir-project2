Purpose and Background </ITAG>In his February 9, 1989, budget address to Congress, President  Bush announcedthe establishment of a cabinet level Task Force to  review environmentalconcerns in three Outer Continental Shelf (OCS)  oil and gas lease salesthat were scheduled for Fiscal Year 1990:  Sale 91, Northern California,Sale 95 Southern California, and Sale  116, Part II, Eastern Gulf of Mexico.The President ordered that  preparations for the three lease sales by theMinerals Management  Service (MMS) be postponed.  Since its formation, the Task Force has held a number of public meetingsand workshops to obtain technical information and public views on thesesales. Purpose of this Notice The purpose of this Notice is twofold: 1. To provide a summary of the environmental concerns presented to dateto the Task Force, including possible ways of addressing these concerns,and 2. To solicit any additional concerns not yet identified and any new ideason how to resolve them. This information will be used by the Task Force in developing recommendationsto be sent to the President by January 1, 1990. Background On March 21, 1989, the White House announced the structure of the President'sOCS Leasing and Development Task Force (Task Force). The members of theTask Force include: the Secretary of the Interior, who serves as Chairman;the Secretary of Energy; the Administrator of the National Oceanic andAtmospheric Administration (NOAA); the Director of the Office of Managementand Budget (OMB); and the Administrator of the Environmental ProtectionAgency (EPA). In addition, the National Academy of Sciences is providingthe Task Force with a technical review of the information about environmentalconcerns and petroleum resources. The general location of the three lease sales under review is shown onFigure 1: <G/><ITAG tagnum="7"> insert illus 522A</ITAG>Sale 91, Northern California (Figure 2)_Approximately 1.1 million acreslocated offshore portions of Mendocino and Humboldt Counties in the NorthernCalifornia Planning Area.

The area is about 25 miles fromthe Dry Tortugas at its closest point to land. <G/><ITAG tagnum="7"> insert illus 528A</ITAG>Based on the President's direction, the Task Force decided to pursue  thefollowing six objectives:  1. Review environmental concerns over adverse environmental impacts  ineach of the three sale areas.  2. Identify and investigate environmental concerns.  3. Explore leasing proposals (including no leasing) for the three  saleareas that might resolve environmental concerns.  4. Review the Administration's energy goals, environmental goals,  andocean management goals as they relate to OCS leasing.  5. Review the question of leasing and operations in the three sale  areasand make recommendations to the President.  6. Review and monitor information available about the <T3>Exxon Valdez</T3> oil spill and cleanup effort which may aid the TaskForce in  accomplishing the five previous objectives.  Since May 9, 1989, nine public workshops have been held. In  California,they were held in Carlsbad, Los Angeles, Arcata, Santa  Barbara, and Sacramento.In Florida, they were held in Tallahassee,  Fort Myers, Miami, and KeyWest. The Task Force heard from over 650  experts, elected officials, andmembers of the general public during  the workshops and received approximately11,000 written comments. The  Task Force also met twice with Members ofCongress who wished to express their views. The Task Force conducted fieldtrips to examine  directly some of the resources that could be affectedas a result of  oil and gas leasing in the proposed sale areas. It alsovisited a  variety of oil and gas facilities.  This Notice summarizes environmental concerns, and options to  resolvethose concerns, which the Task Force has heard over the course  of itsbriefings, workshops, field trips, and meetings with Members of  Congress.The Task Force has not, at this point, developed any  judgments on thevalidity of conflicting claims about environmental  and economic effectsor environmental protection capabilities. Nor  has the Task Force attemptedto evaluate the environmental or economic  consequences of options or screenout any options. In fact, options  are included in this Notice even ifthey have already been  implemented. In the interests of brevity, thissummary of  environmental concerns and options does not attempt to coverthe full  technical detail which was presented to the Task Force.  This Notice is a continuation of the Task Force's information  gatheringprocess. All of the Task Force's workshops and meetings  with Members ofCongress have been transcribed and all written  comments and materialssubmitted to the Task Force have been retained.  Because the Task Forcewill continue to review and analyze these  materials, there is no needfor workshop participants and those who  have already corresponded withthe Task Force to repeat comments or  proposals already made to the TaskForce. Comments in response to  this Notice should identify additionalenvironmental concerns and  options that should be considered.  The Task Force will accept comments on environmental concerns and  optionsfor 30 days_until September 11, 1989.  Comments should be sent to: Robert E. Kallman, Executive Director, President'sOCS Leasing and Development Task Force, 18th and C Streets NW., Washington,DC 20240.    <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Environmental Concerns and Options Common to All Three Sales </ITAG>A. Concerns About the Environmental Effects of OCS Oil and Gas  ActivitiesExpressed in All Three Sale Areas  The Task Force has learned first hand that many residents of the  coastalregions bordering the three sale areas are concerned about the  potentialfor substantial and costly degradation of the coastal and  marine environmentas a result of OCS activities. These concerns were  expressed by the vastmajority of those who participated in the Task  Force workshops.  Many people expressed the view that, while they would suffer the  lossesfrom any environmental effects of oil and gas development, they  standto gain few, if any, of the potential benefits. Moreover, many  suggestedthat the national benefits of a lease sale would be small.  Oil industryrepresentatives and some other workshop participants  expressed a contrastingview that development would provide  substantial benefits in the form ofincreased domestic economic  activity, increased Federal and State revenues,lower oil imports, and enhanced national security. The Task Force has been told by local officials and residents  that theenvironmental effects that can result from OCS exploration  and development,followed by the production and transportation of oil  and gas, are realand concrete. Air and water can be polluted;  plants, fish, birds, andmarine mammals can be hurt; beaches can be  fouled; access to fishing groundsmay be reduced; local land use  patterns may change; and ocean vistas canbe marred by industrial  facilities.  Several representatives of the oil and gas industry participated  on panelsduring the workshops in Florida and California. Their  comments addressedthe safety and environmental record of offshore  development and contradictedmany of the environmental concerns raised  by other panelists. For example,they repeatedly stated that oil  spill risks from offshore oil and gasexploration and development are  significantly lower than risks from tankertraffic. Industry  representatives also described the technology that hasbeen developed  and used to prevent blow-outs, to allow drilling operationsto proceed  with zero discharge into the water and to withstand seismicshocks.  A number of the environmental concerns that were expressed to  the TaskForce are common to the three sales under review. These will  be brieflysummarized in this section while concerns that are unique  or specificto one of the sales will be discussed in a subsequent  section devotedto that specific sale.  <ITAG tagnum="81">Oil Spill Risk  </ITAG>The Task Force heard people strongly express their concerns about  thedamaging effects of oil spills that could result from OCS oil and  gasproduction and transportation in each of the three sale areas.  These concernswere clearly heightened by the catastrophic oil spill  from the <T3>Exxon Valdez</T3> and the extensive damage to Alaskan coastal  resourcesthat it caused. Concerns were expressed about the adequacy  of oil spillprevention, containment, and cleanup equipment and  procedures. Many coastalresidents also expressed strong apprehension  about the damages an oilspill would cause to the beaches, shoreline,  and marine resources whichthey use and value highly. The Task Force  learned in its workshops thatpeople seem to be particularly averse to  risks over which they have littleor no control. Many expressed the  view that, with certain coastal andmarine resources, no risk is  acceptable.<ITAG tagnum="81">Effects on Tourism and Recreation  </ITAG>In all three areas, people expressed the concern that recreation  and thetourism industry, which are important parts of their local  economy, wouldbe harmed by the conduct of oil and gas operations  offshore. They believethat many tourists will choose other areas to  visit because of the riskof an oil spill, the esthetic effects of  seeing oil rigs and platformson the ocean, the reduction in the  quality of marine resources which supportcoastal tourism, and the  construction and operation of industrial supportfacilities onshore.  <ITAG tagnum="81">Effects on Commercial Fishing  </ITAG>Members of the fishing industry in all three areas told the Task  Forcethat they believed their livelihood could be diminished or  threatenedby oil and gas activities. The causes of such interference  include theeffects on fish eggs, larvae, and the dispersion of fish  schools fromthe percussion used in seismic surveys; the exclusion of  fishing fromareas near rigs and platforms; damage to fishing gear  from seismic arrays,anchor scars, and debris left on the ocean floor;  and competition fordock and harbor space.  <ITAG tagnum="81">Effects on Protected Lands  </ITAG>Each of the three areas is near important lands that are included  in Nationaland State Parks, Wildlife Refuges, and other public  recreation areas.Many commenters expressed concern that these  resources and their valuewould be degraded by oil and gas operations.  In many cases the concernedspeakers highlighted the national and  international importance of theseprotected lands.  <ITAG tagnum="81">Effects on Protected Species and Other Wildlife  </ITAG>All three areas provide habitat to species that are endangered  or threatenedas well as many other species of marine mammals,  waterfowl, and fish.Wildlife experts and members of the public told  the Task Force of theirconcerns that wildlife populations would be  reduced if oil and gas activitieswere allowed in the area.  <ITAG tagnum="81">Effects on Water Quality  </ITAG>Discharges into the ocean from drilling rigs and production  platformscould affect water quality in an area undergoing exploration  and development.The Task Force heard many people express particular  concern about thedischarge of drilling muds and cuttings as well as  water produced fromoil and gas reservoirs. The effects of such  discharges on fish, bottomdwelling organisms, coral, and vegetation were of concern.  <ITAG tagnum="81">Changes in Onshore Infrastructure and Land Use  </ITAG>At workshops in all three sale areas, participants expressed  concern aboutthe additional demands for public facilities and  services onshore thatwould be needed to support oil and gas  activities and the resulting populationgrowth. Concern was also  expressed about the location of onshore oil andgas support areas,  processing facilities, and transportation systems.These industrial  facilities were frequently viewed as incompatible withexisting or  planned land use patterns. Many commenters feared that oiland gas  activities could affect coastal property values.  B. Options Applicable to All Three Sale Areas  The Task Force has organized the options and recommendations it  has receivedinto those that apply to all three sale areas and those  that apply toonly one or two of the three. For the options that  apply to all threesales, the Task Force recognizes that the most  fundamental choice is betweenleasing and not leasing in one, two, or  all three of the areas.  <ITAG tagnum="81">Options for Not Leasing  </ITAG>The Task Force has grouped the options for not leasing in each of  thethree sale areas into categories as follows:  1. Establish a permanent ban on oil and gas activities within  the salearea, as has been proposed by advocates of Ocean Sanctuaries.  2. Cancel the lease sale and all subsequent sales scheduled for  the samearea in the 1987-1992 5-Year Leasing Program.  3. Cancel the lease sale and proceed with the next sale in the  same areaonly after selected additional control and mitigation  measures have beendeveloped and adopted to resolve environmental  concerns.  <ITAG tagnum="81">Options for Leasing  </ITAG>The Task Force has grouped the options it has identified for  moving forwardwith leasing in one or more of the lease sale areas  into the followingtwo categories:  1. Continue the status quo, in which the Department of the  Interior (DOI)would resume its normal preparations for the lease  sale, make decisionson sale configuration and stipulations for  protection of the environmentusing existing procedures and policies,  and apply existing regulationsand procedures in overseeing oil and  gas activities.  2. Proceed with leasing after deleting selected areas and/or  adoptingfurther environmental controls and mitigation measures to  resolve environmentalconcerns.  <ITAG tagnum="81">Options for Resolving Environmental Concerns Common to the Three Sale Areas  </ITAG>In order to make the fundamental choice between leasing and not  leasing,it is necessary first to develop various alternatives for  leasing subjectto additional restrictions designed to reduce the  environmental impactsof oil and gas development. These alternatives  can then be compared againstthe no leasing option.  This section is intended to present an array of alternatives or  optionswhich have been suggested as ways to address environmental  concerns. Theorder in which these options are addressed below does  not necessarilyreflect either the public's or the Task Force's view  on the merits ofthe alternatives presented. From the briefings,  workshops, and writtencomments, the Task Force has heard a wide  variety of options for avoiding,postponing, controlling, or  mitigating the effects of offshore oil andgas activities. It is  clear that many of the options could be implementedconcurrently  while others are mutually exclusive. The options common toall three  sale areas are summarized below.  Sale Configuration Options  Exclude tracts near certain marine or land resources in order to  protectthem from the effects of oil and gas activity.  Offer a limited number of tracts to reduce the overall level of  explorationand development activity in one or more of the sale areas.  Options for Controlling the Timing of OCS Activities  Defer the lease sale until certain conditions are met such as the  completionof environmental studies, the development of a needed  environmental protectiontechnology, or the completion of exploration  and development on existingleases in the area.Proceed with leasing and exploration in the area, but allow developmentto be deferred until certain conditions are met such as  demonstrationof improved environmental protection measures or  substantial increasein oil prices.  Proceed with exploratory drilling under Federal management, but  postponeleasing and development until environmental concerns have  been resolvedand energy production benefits are higher.  Environmental Control and Mitigation Options  <ITAG tagnum="74">Oil Spill Risk  </ITAG>At the Task Force briefings and workshops a number of  possibilities weresuggested for reducing the risk of damages from oil  spills. Many of thesecould apply to all sources of oil spills  affecting the marine environmentor all OCS operations. Such options  are summarized in Section VI addressingprogrammatic changes.  The following options for reducing the risk of oil spill damages  in oneor more of the three sale areas reflect the fact that tanker  transportationis a primary source of oil spill risk and that systems  for the prevention,containment, and cleanup of oil spills from  tankers and from OCS facilitiescan be coordinated to achieve  efficient reductions in the risk of damagingoil spills from both  sources:  Improve oil spill prevention, contingency planning, trajectory  analysis,containment, and cleanup drills and capability in the sale  area. Thiscould be required of industry through several possible  mechanisms includinglease stipulations.  Adopt and make mandatory the use of U.S. Coast Guard (USCG)  designatedvessel traffic lanes in the sale area.  Allow State and local governments a greater role in establishment  of vesseltraffic lanes in the sale area.  Install a USCG radar or Global Positioning System  traffic-control systemto monitor vessels in areas near the coast in  the sale area.  Require more frequent, realistic exercises to test OCS lessees'  contingencyplans for spills from rigs, platforms, and tankers  carrying OCS oil. Require pipelines instead of tankers for transportation of OCS  oil toshore and subsequently to refining areas. This might be  required as astipulation for all leases in the sale or for leases  where the oil discoveryon the tract or in nearby tracts exceeds a  level determined accordingto a formula which takes into account the  economics of producing and transportingoil under specific oil  prices.  Limit the total size of tankers used to transport oil from leases  in thesale area; require them to be double-bottomed; limit the size  of individualtanks; require tankers to have special  maneuverability-enhancing features(e.g., bow thrusters).  Encourage or require lessees in the sale area to relocate non-OCS  tankertraffic generally away from stationary OCS rigs and platforms.  Require lessees to permanently staff pre-positioned equipment  with trainedpersonnel, and require that the equipment be maintained  always at fullreadiness.  Require OCS development plans in the sale area to include oil  spill riskoffset measures such as capturing oil from natural seeps,  increasing oilspill containment capability in the area, or reducing  the volume of oiltanker transport in the area. (Oil spill risk  offsets could be reviewedby reference to a National Oil Spill Risk  Assessment discussed in SectionVI.)  Pre-approve acceptable dispersants to allow their immediate use  in theevent of a spill involving pre-specified oils, locations, and  conditionsin the sale area, thereby avoiding delays that could result  while testsare being conducted to determine the acceptability of the  dispersants. Include a stipulation in the leases in the sale area requiring a  specialbond or certification of financial responsibility for  mitigation and compensationfor oil spill damages.  Increase MMS capability to monitor and enforce compliance with  existingoil spill prevention regulations on rigs and platforms in the  sale area,and increase frequency of regular and surprise inspections.  Require lessees to conduct oil spill prevention training for new  workerson platforms and rigs in the sale area, and require periodic  refreshertraining of employees.  Fund additional research and development on cleanup and  preservation ofoiled wildlife species present in the sale area. <ITAG tagnum="74"> Effects on Tourism  </ITAG>Require industry to mitigate economic losses from any foregone  tourismcaused by the environmental effects of or by the mere presence  of OCSdevelopment in the sale area. Some suggested that a mitigation  fee couldbe paid to a local organization for developing tourist  attractions andpromoting tourism.  <ITAG tagnum="74">Effects on Commercial Fishing  </ITAG>The following options have been suggested to the Task Force for  reducingeffects on commercial fishing in each of the sale areas:  Establish liaison offices with the fishing industry, to provide a  communications,mediation, or clearinghouse function, to be staffed by  personnel regardedas ``neutral.''  Impose appropriate seasonal or areal limits on geological and  geophysicalsurvey (G andamp; G) work and OCS drilling in or near sensitive  spawningor larvae production zones.  Require drilling rigs and platforms to be placed on the tract in  a locationwhich minimizes interference with any active fishery over  that tract. Revise or reinterpret MMS regulations on ``diligence'' of a lessee  toexplore and develop a tract, to provide flexibility to temporarily  delayG andamp; G or other work until the end of an important fish spawning  season.Require specified traffic corridors for crew and supply vessels  servicingOCS operations, located to avoid fixed-gear fishing areas.  <ITAG tagnum="74">Effects on Protected Lands and Marine Resources  </ITAG>The following options have been suggested to the Task Force for  reducingeffects on protected lands in each of the sale areas:  Require consideration of resource values of protected areas when  determiningwhich tracts to offer for lease.  Require special oil spill contingency plans, trajectory analysis,  containmentdrills, and capability (e.g., pre-positioning extra  equipment) for leasesissued near protected areas.  <ITAG tagnum="74">Effects on Protected Species and Other Wildlife  </ITAG>The following options have been suggested to the Task Force for  reducingeffects on protected species in each of the sale areas:  Impose seasonal or areal limits on seismic data collection and  other OCS-relatedactivity during times or in areas of particular  importance to marine mammals,e.g., near major seasonal haul-out areas  and during whale migration times. Require vessels conducting seismic data collection to stop  immediatelyif they observe marine mammals in the vicinity.  <ITAG tagnum="74">Effects on Water Quality  </ITAG>The following options have been suggested to the Task Force for  reducingeffects on water quality in each of the sale areas:  Require zero-discharge drilling rigs and platforms, through lease  stipulationsor EPA National Pollutant Discharge Elimination Systems  (NPDES) permitsunder the Clean Water Act.  Require lessees to monitor for long-term impacts of drilling muds  andcuttings and chronic operational discharges.  Require further government or industry research on environmental  impactsof drilling muds and cuttings and chronic operational  discharges.  <ITAG tagnum="74">Changes in Onshore Infrastructure and Land Use  </ITAG>The following options have been suggested to the Task Force for  reducingeffects on infrastructure and land use in each of the sale  areas:  Consolidate facilities at onshore locations.  Establish a mechanism for the Federal Government to provide  coordinationor mediation if OCS-related onshore development causes a  serious conflictwith other existing or planned land uses.  Increase efforts to anticipate necessary onshore development, and  requirelessees to finance a larger part of the State and local  planning processrelating to such development.  Establish a mitigation fee program in which OCS companies  contribute toa fund which finances projects that would mitigate OCS  development effectson infrastructure and land use. Examples include:  construction of additionalinfrastructure (sewage and water treatment,  schools), funding social welfareprograms, provision of new  recreation areas.  Prohibit OCS-related onshore development in areas where it does  not nowexist.  Phase OCS activities with the goal of achieving a relatively  constantlevel of loads on environmental resources and demands for  onshore supportfacilities. In general, new oil and gas activities  would be delayed untilexisting projects have been completed or have  at least begun to phasedown their environmental loads and demands for  onshore support.  Phase development activities to also reduce the peak loads  resulting fromoil and gas production by delaying the startup of new  production capacityuntil production from existing platforms and wells  has begun its naturaldecline. In areas with no existing development,  phasing OCS activitiescan slow the buildups in environmental loads  and onshore support demands,providing more time for the preparation  of onshore responses and facilities.Options for achieving such  phasing include controls over the number andlocation of tracts  offered for lease, of leases actually issued, overthe timing of  exploratory drilling permit approvals, or over developmentplan  approvals.  Require the consolidated use of pipelines by lessees of tracts  near eachother.  Allow lessees in the sale areas a longer time to develop a tract  eitherby issuing longer lease terms or by relaxing diligence requirements atthe development stage.  <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Concerns and Options Specific to Sale 91  </ITAG>A. Environmental Concerns  The Task Force conducted a two-day public workshop in Arcata,  California.The following concerns were expressed during the panel  presentations,discussions, and the public comment period:  <ITAG tagnum="81">Oil Spill Risk  </ITAG>The Task Force heard that the oil spill risk in northern  California ishigh due to Alaska North Slope tanker traffic bound for  San Francisco,Long Beach, and the Panama Canal. OCS activity would  add to these risks.The Task Force was told not to ``add new risks on  top of the risks wealready face from Alaska tankers.''   <ITAG tagnum="81">Effects on Tourism  </ITAG>Many speakers stated that heavy industry is incompatible with the  imagelocal communities want to project in order to encourage tourism.  Many also said that visible offshore rigs and platforms would  alter theimage of the spectacular, rugged, and undeveloped coast and  would reducethe number of tourists attracted to the coastal area.Speakers expressed fears that an oil spill would kill marine  life, whichis a primary attraction for people who visit the northern  California coast. <ITAG tagnum="81">Effects on Commercial Fishing  </ITAG>The commercial fishing contributions to the northern California  economy(ex-vessel value $32 million in 1985) could be adversely  affected by OCSdevelopment, according to representatives of local  governments and fishingconcerns.  The Task Force was told that exploration and development of the  OCS wouldeliminate significant portions of the narrow continental  shelf from accessby trawl. Trawling, the fishing method most  susceptible to displacementby offshore oil and gas activities,  accounts for 45 percent of the catch. Some speakers said the oil and gas industry was responsive to  fishermen'sreports of debris left on the ocean floor by removing the  debris.  <ITAG tagnum="81">Effects on Protected Lands  </ITAG>Concerns were expressed that air emissions from OCS development  coulddegrade the air quality in Redwoods National Park, an area  having ClassI status which prohibits degradation.  Workshop participants expressed concern that oil spills would  pose threatsto national conservation system units (Redwoods National  Park, Point ReyesNational Seashore, and Golden Gate National  Recreation Area; Castle Rock,Humboldt Bay, San Pablo Bay, Farallon,  Point Reyes, and San FranciscoBay National Wildlife Refuges; King  Range National Conservation Area;Cordell Bank and Gulf of the  Farallones National Marine Sancturaries)and State parks.  <ITAG tagnum="81">Effects on Protected Species  </ITAG>Speakers stated that several species, including gray and humpback  whales,which reside in and migrate through the proposed sale areas  would be adverselyaffected by chronic pollutants, oil spills, seismic  surveys, and increasedmarine vessel traffic.  <ITAG tagnum="81">Changes in Onshore Infrastructure and Land Use  </ITAG>Some local government representatives stated that the  infrastructure ofthe coast adjacent to the proposed sale area may not  be able to absorbthe influx of workers and their families.  Population increases that typicallyaccompany oil and gas development  may overload existing schools, housing,and water and sanitary  systems. The area may become subject to cyclesof economic boom and  bust which have accompanied oil and gas developmentin other regions.  <ITAG tagnum="81">Rough Seas  </ITAG>Generally rough seas and frequent storms may affect the  industry's abilityto operate platforms and facilities safely and to  effectively containand clean up oil spills, according to many  workshop speakers.  <ITAG tagnum="81">Operations in a Seismically Active Area   </ITAG>Workshop participants expressed concern that earthquakes,  underwater landslides,and tsunamis pose potential threats to offshore  exploration and developmentequipment and facilities. The seismic  risk in the Eel River Basin is ashigh or higher than any part of the  continental margin with the possibleexception of the south coast of  Alaska. The Eel River Basin is locatedat the junction of three  tectonic plates: Gorda Plate, North AmericanPlate, and the Pacific  Plate. The Task Force was told that the associatedseismic activity  does not necessarily preclude eventual offshore development,but it  does require that seismic engineering be incorporated explicitlyinto  the OCS development process.   B. Sale 91 Options  The following options have been presented to the Task Force in  its briefingsor workshops:  <ITAG tagnum="81">Current Sale 91 Proposal  </ITAG>The area studied for potential leasing in the Sale 91 draft  environmentalimpact statement (EIS) included 52 blocks in the Eel  River Basin offshoreHumboldt County (more specifically, offshore  Eureka and Arcata) and 163blocks in the Point Arena Basin offshore  Mendocino County. The study areaencompasses 1.1 million acres, or 4  percent of the planning area. Theavailable acreage generally ranges  from 3 to 27 miles from shore. Theexceptions are buffers adjacent to  Trinidad Head, Fort Bragg, Point Arena,and Point Delgada Areas of  Special Biological Significance (ASBS's). Deferredat the 5-year  program stage were blocks in greater than 900 meters ofwater, acreage  off Punta Gorda, and the buffers for the ASBS's noted above. In addition to specific block deferrals instituted in the 5-Year  Program,the Secretary of the Interior committed to include similar  levels of protectionas were provided in the lease sale stipulations  for Sales 73 and 80, offshoresouthern California. The Sale 91  proposal includes these special protections,which are intended to  address sensitive biological resources, archaeologicalresources,  military use areas, transportation of hydrocarbon products,conflicts  with commercial fisheries, personnel training programs, oilspill  response requirements, onshore facilities, disposal of drilling discharges, and air quality.  The prelease process for Sale 91 was suspended in June 1988 after  thepublication of the draft EIS (October 1987) and completion of the  EIShearings (February 1988). Proceeding with the sale process as  originallyplanned would entail the development of a final EIS (or an  environmentalassessment or new draft or supplemental EIS, if new  information warrants). Under the existing prelease process, the environmental analyses  in thefinal EIS will be synthesized and incorporated into a  Secretarial IssueDocument (SID), which provides additional economic  and qualitative analysesfor the Secretary. Upon completion of  decision materials, decisions onthe configuration, terms, and  conditions of the proposed Notice of Salewould be made. Comments  from the Governor or executives of affected localgovernments on the  size, timing, and location of the proposal are soughtpursuant to the  consultation requirements of the OCS Lands Act. The Secretaryis  required to accept the recommendations of the Governor [and may accept the recommendations of the executives of affected local governments] if they provide for a reasonable balance between the national interest and the well-being of the citizens of the affected State. Based on  theseconsultations and the balancing consideration, the final sale  could besubstantially different in configuration and special  protection than originallystudied as the proposal. The acreage  offered for lease and the conditionsapplying to the leases are  announced publicly in a Notice of Sale.  <ITAG tagnum="81">Sale Configuration Options  </ITAG>Proceed with the usual sale process beginning with the area  studied inthe EIS.  Governor Deukmejian's Proposal: In addition to the areas  deferred fromSale 91 thus far in the prelease process, Governor  Deukmejian's commentson the draft EIS requested extension of the ASBS  buffers to a full 6 milesfrom the seaward boundary of the ASBS's.  (The buffers currently extend6 miles from the shoreline; some of the  ASBS's are located entirely onland while others extend into the State  tidelands.)  Congressman Panetta's Proposal: In addition to the areas  deferred fromSale 91 thus far in the prelease process, Congressman  Panetta's proposalsubmitted during the development of the current  5-year program would createa coastal buffer of about 6 miles from  shore in the northern group ofavailable blocks and over about 15  miles from shore in the southern group.In addition, Congressman  Panetta's proposal limits the offering of selectedblocks throughout  the California OCS to 50 blocks total within the current5-year  program.  Offer ``gas only'' leases in the northern portion of the Sale 91  area.Leases would convey no rights to produce oil should it be  discovered;however, condensate could be produced.Offer only blocks in Eel River Basin.  Offer only blocks in Point Arena Basin.  Defer areas subject to geologic hazards.  Reconfigure sale to avoid commercial fishing conflicts. The Task  Forceheard options which included:  andbullet; Defer blocks to avoid conflicts with Dover and Petrale sole  spawningand fishing grounds;  andbullet; Defer areas near the mouths of important estuaries to protect fish and shellfish resources;  andbullet; Defer blocks in the southern portion of the Point Arena basin to reduce potential oil spill risk to the Farallon Islands/Point Reyes areas.  andbullet; Defer all tracts with annual commercial fishing catches  exceedingone million pounds.   <ITAG tagnum="81">Environmental Control and Mitigation Options  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Oil Spill Risk </ITAG>Require additional protection for Point Reyes National Seashore, RedwoodsNational Park, and Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary throughincreased spill containment capability and buffer zones.  <ITAG tagnum="74">Effects on Commercial Fishing  </ITAG>Limit the timing of seismic surveys to avoid conflicts with  fishing seasonsand to protect Dover and Petrale Sole spawning and  nursery areas.  <ITAG tagnum="74">Air Quality  </ITAG>Require mechanisms to insure air quality is not degraded.  Lease stipulations would require that offshore facilities meet  onshoreair quality standards. Residual emissions could be mitigated  by onshoreoffsets. Special measures should be undertaken to prevent  degradationof Class I air quality areas (e.g. Redwoods National  Park).   <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Concerns and Options Specific to Sale 95  </ITAG>A. Environmental Concerns  The Task Force conducted public workshops in Carlsbad, Los  Angeles, andSanta Barbara. In addition to the general concerns  summarized above, thefollowing specific concerns were expressed  during the panel presentations,discussions, and the public comment  period:  <ITAG tagnum="81">Reductions in Air Quality  </ITAG>Workshop participants were of the opinion that increasing  emissions fromOCS exploration and development would exacerbate the  air quality problemin southern California, which suffers from the  worst air quality in theNation. The majority of the onshore area  adjoining Lease Sale 95 is designatedas nonattainment for the ozone  standard set by EPA. These onshore areasalready implement stringent  emission control standards and are in theprocess of adopting measures  which would cause dramatic lifestyle changesfor southern California  residents.  <ITAG tagnum="81">Oil Spill Risk  </ITAG>Potential effects of a large oil spill on the heavily used  beaches insouthern California, tourism, fisheries, and quality of  life were majorconcerns. Another major concern was the adequacy of  present oil spillcontainment and cleanup techniques in adverse sea  conditions.  <ITAG tagnum="81">Effects on Tourism  </ITAG>Speakers expressed concern that changes in recreation and tourism  patternsand expenditures may occur as a result of OCS development  (for example,according to some witnesses, the mere sight of OCS rigs  may deter tourists)or accidents. Along the southern California  coast, recreation is primarilywater-oriented, from the standpoint of  both active participation and aesthetic,passive aspects.  <ITAG tagnum="81">Effects on Commercial Fishing  </ITAG>The Task Force heard that loss of fishing gear such as crab pots  couldoccur due to entanglement with seismic boat cables. Competition  for berthingspace and support services and potential economic  ramifications couldoccur. Other concerns included reduction in  harvestable fish (albacoretuna, rockfishes, Pacific ocean shrimp,  California halibut, rock crab,and several species of sole) and  invertebrate stocks due to oil spills,man-made structures blocking  trawl areas, debris, anchor scars, and vesseltraffic.  <ITAG tagnum="81">Effects on Protected Lands  </ITAG>Speakers stated that there is a need to place certain areas of  the OCSpermanently off-limits to oil and gas development in order to  protectcertain environmentally sensitive areas of the OCS or the  coast. Areasthat they said should be considered for such protection  include: ChannelIslands National Park and Santa Monica Mountains  National Recreation Area,Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary,  State parks, State Areas ofSpecial Biological Significance, fishery  spawning or nursery areas, andthe mouths of estuaries and rivers.  <ITAG tagnum="81">Effects on Protected Species  </ITAG>Workshop speakers said that the effects of noise from OCS oil and  gasexploration and development may affect behavior of marine mammals  andseabirds. In particular, this could cause abandonment of  rookeries andchanges in migration routes. Physical disruption of  haulout areas androokeries by pipeline construction and oil spill  cleanup operations mightoccur. Seven endangered whale species  inhabit the lease sale area includingthe gray, humpback, fin, sperm,  blue, sei, and right whales. Two threatenedmarine mammals, the  southern sea otter and the Guadalupe fur seal, inhabitthe area.  There are three endangered turtles (leatherback, green and olive ridley) and one threatened species of turtle (loggerhead) in the area. The five endangered species of birds are: California least terns,  Americanperegrine falcon, bald eagle, California brown pelican, and  the light-footedclapper rail.  <ITAG tagnum="81">Effects on Water Quality  </ITAG>Some witnesses expressed concern about degradation of water  quality nearplatforms due to acute and chronic discharges (oil  spills, dispersants,drilling fluids, formation water, and trace  metals). The water qualityof Santa Monica Bay has been seriously  degraded by local municipal discharges.Discharges from OCS  development could impair the recovery of the Bay. <ITAG tagnum="81">Geological Hazards  </ITAG>Southern California is a seismically active area. Some witnesses  expressedconcern about failure of OCS oil and gas related structures  due to potentialearthquakes which could result in release of  hydrocarbons or loss of life.<ITAG tagnum="81">Changes in Onshore Infrastructure and Land Use  </ITAG>Some workshop participants were concerned that further  development inthe areas could result in increased traffic on roads  that already areheavily used, could result in construction of  pipelines and other onshorefacilities that would interfere with  existing land uses; and would resultin increased production of  hazardous and non-hazardous wastes that wouldbe difficult to handle  in existing disposal facilities.  <ITAG tagnum="81">Visual Impacts  </ITAG>Some witnesses were concerned about degradation of the visual  environmentcaused by platform placement offshore scenic and pristine  areas in theSale 95 area.  <ITAG tagnum="81">Marine Transportation  </ITAG>Witnesses expressed concern about increased risk of vessel  accidents,due to additional crew and supply boat and shuttle tanker  transits, andrisk of collision with additional platforms offshore.  Southern Californiawaters are heavily used by recreational and  commercial vessels. Long Beachharbor is an important terminal for  tankers carrying crude oil from Alaskaand other areas as well as  petroleum products.   B. Options for Sale 95  The following options have been presented to the Task Force in  its briefingsor workshops:  <ITAG tagnum="81">Current Status of Sale 95 Planning  </ITAG>The area identified in October 1987 for study for potential  leasing includedapproximately 6.7 million acres offshore southern  California from thenorthern boundary of San Luis Obispo County to the  U.S. Mexico provisionalboundary. This represents 22 percent of the  planning area. Deferred fromconsideration at the 5-year program  stage were the following areas: blocksin greater than 900 meters of  water; Santa Barbara Channel Federal EcologicalPreserve and Buffer  Zone; blocks within 6 miles of the Santa Barbara ChannelIslands  National Marine Sanctuary; blocks offshore Santa Monica from Point Dume to Long Beach; blocks within a coastal buffer offshore Newport  Beachand the Irvine Coast Marine Life Refuges and Heisler Park ASBS;  blockswithin a coastal buffer offshore San Diego Marine Life Refuge  and SanDiego-La Jolla Ecological Reserve ASBS; the area offshore San  Diego; andthe San Nicolas Basin Navy Operating Area. Additionally, at  the initialstages of Sale 95, the Call for Information and Area  Identification, extensivemilitary use areas south of the Channel  Islands were deferred from consideration. As with Sale 91, as part of the decisions on the 5-Year Program,  the Secretaryof the Interior committed to a similar level of  protection for the arearesources as was provided in the Sale 73 and  80 decisions.  The prelease process for Sale 95 was suspended in February 1989.  The acreageoffshore Camp Pendleton and Oceanside was the subject of a  supplementalCall for Information issued in November 1988. Proceeding  with the saleprocess would entail completing the second Area  Identification and continuingtherefrom with the development of a  draft EIS, distribution of the EISfor public review and comment, and  conduct of public hearings. The othersteps of the leasing process  would follow as described above for Sale91.  <ITAG tagnum="81">Sale Configuration Options  </ITAG>Proceed with the usual sale process beginning with the area  studied inthe EIS.  Governor Deukmejian's proposal. In addition to the areas  deferred to datein the prelease process for Sale 95, Governor  Deukmejian, in commentson the Sale 95 Call for Information, requested  deferral of the followingareas (The Governor did note the  opportunity for directional drillinginto some of these areas.):<ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Additional 1-mile buffer zone around the following  ASBS's:San Miguel, Santa Rosa, and Santa Cruz Islands; Santa  Barbara Island andAnacapa Island; San Clemente Island; Santa  Clara Island, Subareas 1-4;San Diego-La Jolla Ecological Reserve;  Heisler Park Ecological Reserve;and San Diego Marine Life Refuge;  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Tracts in the 6-mile buffer from the seaward boundary of the ASBS from Mugu Lagoon to Latigo Point at the border of Ventura  andLos Angeles Counties;  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Tracts in the 3-mile buffer from the seaward boundary of the California oil and gas sanctuaries including portions of areas  offSan Luis Obispo, Orange, and San Diego Counties, as well as  part of SantaCatalina Island;  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Blocks offshore Dana Point, Santa Catalina Island, San  DiegoCounty, San Luis Obispo County, and Santa Monica Bay area,  and the beachesfrom Point Mugu to Point Fermin which had been  deleted from past leasesales;  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Blocks within 12 miles of shore within the range of the southern sea otter;  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Blocks in the vessel precautionary area off the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles; and  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Blocks offshore San Diego.</ITAG> Congressman Panetta's proposal: In addition to the areas  deferred fromSale 95 thus far, Congressman Panetta, during the  development of the current5-Year Program, identified for deferral all  blocks seaward of the southernextension of the southern sea otter  range from San Simeon Point to thenorthern boundary of the planning  area, blocks seaward of the Santa MonicaBay deferral, blocks in the  Los Angeles-Long Beach Harbor area, and blockswithin a coastal buffer  running south from Huntington Beach.  In addition, Congressman Panetta would limit the offering of  specifiedblocks throughout the California OCS areas to 50 blocks  total within thecurrent 5-year program. Included in this category  are blocks adjacentto the buffer at the southern portion of the  southern sea otter range,three blocks at the southwestern tip of his  suggested Santa Monica Bayarea deferral, and blocks beyond his  suggested buffers offshore Dana Pointand from San Clemente to La  Jolla.  Congressman Regula's proposal: In addition to the areas deferred  fromSale 95 to date, Congressman Regula's proposal submitted during  the developmentof the current 5-Year Program includes the six  northernmost rows of blocksin the planning area.  Split the sale in order to offer separately (or in some  combination) blocksin the Morro Bay area, blocks near existing leases  in the Santa MariaBasin, blocks in the Santa Barbara Basin, blocks  near existing leasesoffshore Los Angeles County, and blocks south of  the Los Angeles/OrangeCounty boundary. Because of differences in the  levels of existing developmentand varying environmental concerns,  different timing, deferrals, and mitigationmeasures could be applied  to these separate areas.  <ITAG tagnum="81">Environmental Control and Mitigation Options  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Air Quality Options  </ITAG>Have DOI issue final regulations based on the January 1989 Notice  of ProposedRulemaking, which expanded regulatory controls and  mitigation to all explorationand development activities on the  California OCS and established morestringent compliance requirements  for California OCS activities.  Have DOI issue regulations that assure equivalence in the  requirementsapplicable to OCS facilities/activities, as compared to  facilities/activitiesonshore or in State waters, but do not require  OCS facilities to meetexactly the same standards as for onshore. For  example, the regulationsmight use a ``sliding scale'' system to impose  less stringent restrictionson OCS facilities which are relatively  further offshore.  Have DOI issue regulations which would require OCS facilities and  relatedactivities to meet the same emission requirements as well as  proceduraland enforcement requirements as apply to similar facilities  onshore. Thisapproach might include a requirement for DOI to consult  with EPA or arequirement that DOI obtain EPA certification that the  OCS facility/activitymeets appropriate standards applicable to  onshore and State-waters facilities/activities. Transfer legal jurisdiction over OCS air emissions out of the OCS  LandsAct (administered by DOI) and put OCS facilities and related  activitiesunder jurisdiction of the Clean Air Act (administered by  EPA, the State,and local Air Quality Management Districts (AQMD)).  Establish one or more AQMDs on the Federal OCS, with an  implementationplan to be developed by MMS or EPA. The OCS AQMDs  would negotiate withthe adjacent onshore AQMDs to allocate allowable  emissions within thesame air basin (or emissions which affect more  than one air basin). Theallocation among the various AQMDs would be  subject to approval by EPA. Extend control requirements to crew and supply boats, which  witnessesstated may account for as much as 50 percent of the  OCS-related air emissions.There are two types of controls. One  involves physical changes, such asengine modifications and fuel  switching. The second type of control isoperational, such as a speed  limit, or a boat-pooling requirement.  Require new sources within 25 miles of shore to apply Lowest  AchievableEmission Rate (LAER) or Best Available Control Technology  (BACT), whenoffshore of a nonattainment or attainment area,  respectively. The precedingrequirements could apply to both  stationary and mobile offshore sources. Require new stationary and mobile sources locating offshore of a  nonattainmentarea to offset emissions in the same manner as required  for onshore sources. Require new emission sources locating offshore of a nonattainment  areato offset emissions at a ratio of 1:1 to prevent an increase in  emissions,or to offset emissions at a ratio of greater than 1:1 to  assure a netreduction of emissions. The preceding requirement could  apply to bothstationary and mobile offshore sources. New sources  located offshore ofan attainment area would be required to offset  emissions only when a thresholdemissions limit is surpassed.  Encourage the use of non-traditional offsets, for example,  reduction ofmobile source emissions through fleet conversion and  carpool programs.Carpool programs are an example of an offset that  also could have energyconservation benefits.  Establish a mitigation fee program to provide an alternative  method fornew sources to acquire offsets. The new source would pay a  fee to a designatedagency, such as the AQMD. The Agency would be  responsible to identify,develop, and certify the offsets. This  program would emphasize the developmentof non-traditional offsets.  Require the adoption of an inspection and maintenance plan to  reduce fugitiveemissions from OCS facilities.  Require crew and supply vessels to operate from ports nearer to  rigs andplatforms.  Require all non-emergency pumps, compressors, and other equipment  on OCSplatforms and rigs to be powered by electricity. This option  assumes thatstringent air pollution control equipment would be  installed at the powerplant (whether onshore or offshore) generating  the electricity.  Require DOI to participate in the onshore evaluation and planning  process.Onshore air quality agencies must periodically evaluate  their air qualityprogram to determine whether projected emission  reductions are in factoccurring and whether the reductions are having  the desired effect. AdditionalOCS measures would be adopted if  necessary in light of the review.  Require DOI to issue air quality permits for all existing and new  OCSsources. The permits would be analogous to onshore permits issued  by localair pollution control districts and would specify enforceable  emissionlimits. These permits would also facilitate the use of  offsets from OCSsources because the offsets from other OCS sources  would be more easilyverifiable.  <ITAG tagnum="74">Oil Spill Risk  </ITAG>Encourage or require industry to relocate non-OCS tanker traffic  outsidethe Santa Barbara Channel, and generally away from stationary  oil/gasplatforms.Install a USCG radar or Global Positioning System traffic-control  systemto direct vessels in the Santa Barbara Channel. Move the USCG vessel traffic lanes entirely out of the Santa  Barbara Channel.Move the southbound USCG vessel traffic lane out of the Santa  BarbaraChannel, because that is the lane used most often by laden oil  tankersin this area (i.e., Alaska oil tankers heading for Long  Beach). <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Concerns and Options Specific to Sale 116, Part II </ITAG>A. Environmental Concerns The Task Force held Workshops in Tallahassee, Fort Myers, Miami, and  KeyWest, Florida. The following concerns were expressed during the  panelpresentations, discussion, and public comment period: <ITAG tagnum="81">Oil Spill Risk </ITAG>Citizens and elected officials raised a number of concerns about  the riskof oil spills and the ability of industry or Government to  clean up aftera major spill. Nearly every speaker indicated that any  increased riskof an oil spill is too great to accept in  mangrove-seagrass-coral ecosystems.Speakers said that the oil spill  response to the <T3>Exxon Valdez</T3> spill shows the oil industry is not  really preparedto clean up spills. Speakers noted that current oil spill risks are already high in  southwestFlorida due to existing oil tanker traffic to the south of  the area andthrough the area. The cumulative effect of oil drilling  and associateddevelopment would increase those risks. Speakers pointed out that if oil is developed, it will probably  be broughtashore via tankers. Tankers pose far more significant  risks of oil spillsthan pipelines. Workshop participants expressed concern that attempting to remove  oilfrom mangroves, corals, and sandy- or mud-bottom estuaries would  exacerbateecological damage caused by the spilled oil. The mangrove forests, coral reefs, and seagrass communities  contactedby an oil spill in Panama have suffered extensively and  shown little signof recovery in 2 years since the spill. The same  could happen in southwesternFlorida according to workshop participants. Oil and gas industry representatives stated that drilling and  producingoperations offshore Florida are expected to pose relatively  low environmentalrisk due to shallow water and low pressure and high  viscosity oil likelyto be found in oil and gas reservoirs. <ITAG tagnum="81">Effects on Tourism and Recreation </ITAG>Many commenters stated that tourists would avoid Florida's west  coastand Keys if offshore oil and gas were developed there, which  could substantiallydamage the State's largest industry. Speakers were concerned that corals, which are a major tourist  attraction,are extremely sensitive to pollutants and turbidity from  drilling muddischarges. The Task Force was told that recreational and pleasure craft  would haveto compete for limited dock space with oil and gas  equipment and supplyvessels. <ITAG tagnum="81">Effects on Commercial Fishing </ITAG>Workshop participants raised the following concerns: The commercial and recreational fisheries in Florida, which  generate acombined economic impact of over $1.6 billion annually,  could be adverselyaffected by OCS development.  Eggs, larvae, and juvenile fish are susceptible to chronic  pollutantsand acute oil spills. Development would disrupt productive marine resource habitats  such asestuaries, seagrass beds, and coral reefs. <ITAG tagnum="81">Effects on Protected Lands </ITAG>Federal, State, and local governments as well as private  organizationshave invested millions of dollars to purchase much  of the coastal landsin southwest Florida for nature preserves, public  recreation, and shorelineprotection. The United Nations has  designated Everglades National Parkand Fort Jefferson National  Monument (Dry Tortugas) ecosystem as an ``InternationalBiosphere  Reserve.'' If an oil spill or chronic pollution from oil andgas  drilling operations were to occur and foul these areas, the reasonfor  their designation (i.e., the protection of the Florida Everglades) would be irreparably damaged, according to workshop participants. Numerous citizens and elected officials voiced their concerns  over theimportance of assuring that public and private natural areas  be protectedfrom increased risks of oil spills. They raised issues  over acute andchronic pollution that would result from oil and gas  development. The Task Force heard that designated national parks and  sanctuaries containmany endangered and threatened species that could  be affected by an oilspill. Participants highlighted that Everglades and Biscayne National  Parks,Ft. Jefferson National Monument, and Looe Key and Key Largo  National MarineSanctuaries are likely to be contaminated if an oil  spill occurs fromOCS leases.  Beaches and parks in Florida are one of the State's primary  tourist attractions.There is no proven environmentally sound way to  remove oil from sandybeaches or mangrove roots. <ITAG tagnum="81">Effects on Protected Species </ITAG>Workshop participants stated that increased marine vessel traffic  couldpose threats to sea turtles and manatees. Five species of  endangered andthreatened sea turtles inhabit the area. The  endangered West Indian manateeinhabits coastal mangroves and rivers  in the area. The Task Force was told that drilling muds and other pollutants  wouldreduce viability of sea grasses. Manatees and sea turtles forage  on seagrasses and organisms which inhabit them. Concerns were expressed that an oil spill contacting Ft.  Jefferson NationalMonument could have devastating effects on seabird  colonies. The islandscontain one of the two largest seabird nesting  colonies along the U.S.Gulf of Mexico coast. <ITAG tagnum="81">Changes in Onshore Infrastructure and Land Use </ITAG>Local officials and citizens expressed concern over onshore  impacts associatedwith oil and gas development. Florida has one of  the highest rates ofpopulation increase in the country. The rapidly  rising population placesdemands on natural resources and public  services_roads, water, schools,hospitals_which are currently at  capacity.  Citizens and officials voiced the following concerns to the Task  Force:Solid waste disposal opportunities are extremely limited  throughout thearea. If Government requires companies to use ``zero  discharge drillingrigs,'' companies would have to bring drilling muds  and other pollutants,some of which are toxic, to land. Southwest  Florida has no place to putadditional solid wastes. Harbor space currently used by commercial fishing and  recreational marinasis likely to be most affected by demands from OCS  activity. Since creationof new ports is undesirable in most areas  shortages and conflicts couldresult.Demands for fresh water from onshore facilities supporting OCS  activitywill exacerbate existing shortages and saltwater intrusion,  which arecharacteristic of the area.  The Florida Keys are not capable of supporting onshore staging  and supportfacilities for oil and gas development.  <ITAG tagnum="81">Hurricanes and Emergency Preparedness  </ITAG>The Task Force heard that regular occurrence of hurricanes  increases thepotential for oil spills from platforms and tankers.  The Dry Tortugasis a major hurricane entry point into the Gulf of  Mexico. Over 150 hurricanesswept through the area between 1871 and  1986.  Furthermore, participants pointed out that hurricanes and  tropical stormscould rapidly spread any spilled oil.  The emergency response capabilities of local governments are  already strainedduring and after hurricanes. This would make it  difficult for them todeal with an oil spill at same time.  <ITAG tagnum="81">Submerged Habitats  </ITAG>The numerous corals in the south Florida area are very sensitive  to pollutantsand sediment accumulation.  The Task Force was told that drilling mud discharges can affect  coralreefs, sea grasses, and hard bottom areas, especially in  shallow, clearwater. Recent studies in the Big Bend areas off  Florida have shown thatsea grasses within 300 meters of a drill  platform were completely buriedand killed. Biomass and productivity  were affected out to 3.7 kilometersfrom the drilling facilities.   B. Options for Sale 116, Part II  The following options have been presented to the Task Force in  its briefingsor workshops:  <ITAG tagnum="81">Current Sale 116, Part II Proposal  </ITAG>The area identified as Sale 116, Part II includes about 14  million acresbetween 26anddegrees; and 24anddegrees; North latitude offshore southwest Florida. The northern boundary of the area is just south of Naples.  Theeastern boundary of the area under consideration for lease is  about 30miles from the mainland coast at its closest point. The  southern boundaryis about 25 miles north of the Dry Tortugas.  Unlike Sales 91 and 95, a final EIS for Sale 116 was published  and distributed.Sale 116 was split at the proposed notice of sale  stage in June 1988.Part II was postponed and later, in February  1989, included in the TaskForce effort. While two special  State/Federal task forces conducted reviewsof oil spill trajectories  and potential effects of exploration, the preleaseprocess did not  continue.  <ITAG tagnum="81">Sale Configuration Options  </ITAG>Proceed with the usual sale process beginning with the area  studied inthe EIS.  Allow no leasing or drilling within 30 miles of shore south of 26  degreesnorth.  Lease no areas containing coral reef or other environmentally  sensitivelands.  Delete tracts in any known upwelling areas, submarine canyons,  and ridges. Establish larger buffer zones around the Fort Jefferson National  Monument(Dry Tortugas).  Permit leasing only in the blocks in the Pulley Ridge and/or  Howell Hookareas.  <ITAG tagnum="81">Timing of Leasing, Exploration and Development Options  </ITAG>Cancel Lease Sale 116, Part II and all future lease sales in the  area.This is essentially the only option expressed by the vast  majority ofindividuals at the four workshops in Florida and through  written comments.In addition to canceling Lease Sale 116, Part II,  many expressed the viewthat all existing permits for exploration from  previous lease sales inthose areas south of 26 degrees North be  revoked and leases repurchasedso as to exclude any oil and gas  development activities.  Many expressed a view that there should be no oil and gas  developmentin the entire Florida OCS.  Delay leasing and exploration in the Part II area until  exploration anddevelopment is complete north of 26anddegrees; North latitude.  Delay leasing until additional environmental analysis is  conducted toreflect new information emerging from hydrocarbon  resource evaluationand other task force efforts and studies in  Florida. The additional analysiswould be made available to the  public. Subsequent steps of the leasingprocess would follow as  described above from the point of publishing thefinal EIS for Sale  91.  Allow one (or a few) test wells on existing leases to improve  resourceestimates.Require that all existing leases be explored before leasing  additionaltracts.  Industry representatives stated that exploration and development  of alreadyleased tracts should proceed according the lessee's  schedule.   <ITAG tagnum="81">Environmental Control and Mitigation Options  </ITAG>Require zero discharge drilling and production equipment.  Require pipelines for transport of oil and gas to processing  facilitieson shore (less risk of spill).  Require tankers/barges instead of pipelines to transport oil and  gas toprocessing facilities (less damage to bottom environments).  Prohibit drilling or platform placement within a specified  distance ofcoral reefs, live bottoms, or seagrass beds.  Prohibit drilling mud discharges within a specified distance of  coralreefs, live bottoms, or seagrass beds.  Seasonally restrict seismic data collection and drilling  activities toavoid primary concentrations of ecologically and  commercially valuablespecies.  Require industry to mitigate damage to highly productive areas  such asseagrass beds and coral reefs.  Improve oil spill response capabilities by conducting further  testingof dispersants and their effects on ecosystems of south  Florida.  <ITAG tagnum="81">Changes in Onshore Infrastructure and Land Use  </ITAG>Increase Federal funds to local communities and the State of  Florida todefray costs of planning and providing services needed to  accommodateincreased population and industry needs resulting from OCS  development. Require consolidation of shore-based support facilities at  existing industrialport facilities, e.g., Tampa.  <ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Programmatic Changes Raised by Workshop Participants  </ITAG>The Task Force heard a wide range of options recommending  fundamentalchanges to the OCS leasing program through amendment of  the OCS LandsAct and other statutes, preparation of integrated  national plans relatingto energy and oil spill risk management, and  general practices used bythe Minerals Management Service (MMS) in  leasing and supervision of lessees. A. Changes to the OCS Leasing Program  <ITAG tagnum="81">Development of Next 5-Year Oil and Gas Leasing Program  </ITAG>Many comments addressed the 5-Year Leasing Program. Section 18  of theOCS Lands Act requires the Department of the Interior to  prepare and maintaina 5-Year OCS Oil and Gas Leasing Program designed  to set out the size,timing and location of OCS leasing activities in  such a way as to meetnational energy needs and obtain a proper  balance between the potentialenvironmental damage, the potential for  the discovery of oil and gas,and the potential for adverse impact on  the coastal zone. On July 14,1989, the Interior Department initiated  the public consultation processrequired for the development of a new  program to supersede the current5-Year Program which covers the  period from July 1987 to July 1992. Theprogram development process  takes over two years and is projected to resultin final approval of a  new program by the fall of 1991, covering OCS leasingactivity over  the period from that time until the fall of 1996. The processwill  include participation by the public, State and local governments, environmental organizations, and Members of Congress. Any decisions  whichthe President may make on recommendations of the OCS Leasing and  DevelopmentTask Force which would affect the next 5-Year Program can  be incorporatedas a part of this process.  <ITAG tagnum="81">Exclude Frontier Areas From the 5-Year Plan  </ITAG>It was recommended that frontier areas should be set on a  separate schedulewhich reflects greater demand for research and  public involvement. Analysisand research required to accurately  document resources and potential effectsis more complex in frontier  areas, where leasing has not previously occurred,than in those areas  with a leasing history. It was suggested that morestudy is needed  before the decision is made to include such areas in the5-Year  Leasing Program.  <ITAG tagnum="81">Expand Revenue Sharing with Coastal States  </ITAG>Under Section 8(g) of the OCS Land Act the Federal Government  shares revenuesfrom OCS leasing with the coastal States. At present,  coastal States receive27 percent of the bonus bids, rents, and  royalties from OCS leases inthe first 3 miles of the OCS. The Task  Force heard suggestions to increaseboth the areas subject to sharing  OCS receipts and the percentage. TheTask Force was told that the OCS  Lands Act should be amended to providefor payments of shared revenues  directly to coastal communities affectedby OCS activity, in addition  to States. A variant of this option was presentedto institute  revenue sharing within the 12-mile territorial sea with Statesor to  institute a graduated revenue sharing system that would encompassthe  entire OCS but would reduce the percentage of revenue shared as the distance from shore increases.  <ITAG tagnum="81">Increase States' Involvement in Leasing Decisions  </ITAG>The Task Force was asked to consider ways to increase affected  coastalStates' participation in OCS decisions including whether to  lease andthe timing, extent, and conditions of leasing. For example,  the OCS LandsAct could be amended to require that the Governors of  affected Statesapprove lease sales, plans of exploration, and  development and productionplans.  <ITAG tagnum="81">Amend CZMA to Include Consistency Review of OCS Lease Sales  </ITAG>The Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) provides for State review  of activitiesin plans of OCS exploration, development, and production  for consistencywith State coastal zone management programs. The CZMA  does not, however,authorize State consistency review of lease sales.  The Task Force heardsuggestions that subjecting sales to consistency  review would assure leasingthat is compatible with approved State and  local coastal management plans.<ITAG tagnum="81">Improve Other Federal Agency Involvement in OCS Decisions  </ITAG>In addition to the MMS, several Federal Agencies participate in  the OCSprocess through consultations relating to effects on  endangered and protectedspecies, air and water quality permits,  effects on conservation systemunits, transportation, and oil spill  prevention and containment planningand response. Concern was  expressed that participation of these agencies,which include, the  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Park Service,the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the U.S.  Coast Guard,and the Department of Energy, in the decisions affecting  leasing and developmentin the OCS is not always clearly defined along  established processes.The Task Force was encouraged to recommend  processes through which otherFederal Agencies may formally  participate in decisions.  <ITAG tagnum="81">Increase Public Involvement in OCS Decisions  </ITAG>It was recommended that MMS increase the level of public and  State agencyinvolvement in analysis and decisions affecting the OCS.   B. Integrated Planning  <ITAG tagnum="81">National Oil Spill Risk Assessment and Management  </ITAG>The Task Force heard many comments on the threat of oil spills.  Sourcesof oil spill risk in addition to OCS production and transport  includeforeign tankers in U.S. waters, U.S.-flagged tankers and  barges carryingAlaskan oil and refined products, and offshore  production in State waters.The Task Force has been encouraged to  recommend that a national oil spillrisk assessment be conducted. Such  an assessment would identify the sourcesof oil spill risk nationally  and provide a systematic basis for reducingoil spill risks.  Reductions in the risks from existing sources could offsetthe  additional risk from a new source such as additional OCS development. Furthermore, additional oil spill response capabilities established in an area could be used to contain and clean-up oil spills from both OCS and non-OCS sources. One approach in areas of high oil spill risk  (suchas the areas near major oil tanker ports) is to allow no  additional sourceof risk (such as OCS development) unless the added  risk is offset by otherreductions. Limitations on oil tanker routes  could reduce oil spill riskin an area where OCS development could  occur. A national assessment ofoil spill risk could be used to  identify those areas that would benefitfrom additional oil spill  prevention, containment and cleanup capability. In addition to the potential for large oil spills, significant  amountsof oil constantly enter the marine environment from surface  run-off, municipalwastes, normal vessel operations, and natural  seeps. As with the assessmentof oil spill risk, the Task Force was  encouraged to recommend conductof an inventory of sources of oil in  coastal environments. This inventorycould serve as an additional  basis for offsets. For example, to offsetthe additional risk of oil  spills from OCS development, oil/water separatorscould be installed  in storm sewer outfalls.  The following options have been suggested to reduce oil spill  risk fromtankers, the primary source of large spills:  Improve oil spill prevention, contingency planning, trajectory  analysis,containment, and cleanup drills and capability for tanker  spills. Thiscould be required through several possible mechanisms,  many of which areaddressed in bills now before the Congress.  Coordination with the AmericanPetroleum Institute's  recently-announced ``Petroleum Industry ResponseOrganization'' may also  prove beneficial.  Increase Government funding for the U.S. Coast Guard's (USCG)  oil spillprevention, response, and cleanup functions. This could  include fundingfor additional pre-positioning of current equipment  and for Randamp;D toimprove containment and cleanup technology. Include  more frequent trainingexercises for Government personnel, at all  levels, to heighten readinessand to improve integration of the  various responsibilities carried outby the different levels of  Government in responding to an oil spill. Eliminate or increase limits on liability for damages from oil  spills. Review (and if necessary, revise) the National Contingency Plan  to determineits adequacy to address major spills, with special regard  to Government-industryand inter- and intragovernmental aspects.  Develop deepwater ports for the unloading of tankers to reduce  nearshoretanker operations.  Revise Federal statutes governing design, construction,  operation, manningand piloting of oil tankers.  A number of suggestions were made to the Task Force that would  addressoil spill risk on the entire OCS:  Amend the OCS Lands Act to eliminate or increase limits on  liability fordamages from OCS oil spills.  Provide greater assurance of availability of funds for prompt  responseto an OCS oil spill and for full compensation of injured  parties.  Require special bonds or certification of financial  responsibility formitigation and compensation for damages.  <ITAG tagnum="81">Integrated Environmental Offsets  </ITAG>The Task Force has identified an opportunity to reduce several  differenttypes of environmental loads to which OCS activities  contribute througha program in which OCS lessees would conduct or  finance projects thatwould reduce several different existing  environmental loads. A good exampleof such a project is the  development and operation of a commuter transportationsystem using  alternative fuels. A vanpooling system using alternativefueled  vehicles could reduce onshore air emissions, reduce the risk ofoil  spills from tankers by reducing crude oil demand, and could also reduce congestion on the highways. In southern California for example, many projects that achieve savings in oil consumption will have the  advantageof reducing both air emissions and oil spill risks.  By contributing to such a project, oil companies seeking  approval fora major development project offshore could reduce  existing air emissionsand oil spill risk by more than the increases  caused by the offshore development.Options for implementing this  approach include expanding the existingair emission offsets program  to include non-traditional sources, generalizingit to include oil  spill risk and other environmental loads, and establishinga fund to  finance public projects and programs through mitigation feespaid for  uncontrolled and unmitigated emissions.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. National Energy Policy Options  </ITAG>Development of the National Energy Strategy  The President has directed the Department of Energy to begin  developmentof a comprehensive ``National Energy Strategy.'' This new  policy is intendedto guide the Nation in achieving ample supplies of  competitively pricedenergy in a manner that recognizes the  environmental, economic, health,and safety needs of the American  public. The National Energy Strategywill be an integrated plan that  emphasizes conservation as a key component. Beginning in August, public hearings on the National Energy  Strategy willbe held in locations throughout the country. Comments  will be solicitedfrom public officials, industry leaders,  environmental groups, and concernedcitizens on a wide range of energy  issues and recommended solutions. Theresults of the hearings will be  compiled, and the information will bemade available to the public. A  preliminary draft of the National EnergyStrategy is scheduled for  release in April 1990.  Energy Policy Recommendations Received by the Task Force  At each workshop, the OCS Task Force was told repeatedly that the  proposedlease sales should not be conducted because the Nation does  not have acomprehensive national energy policy. Numerous witnesses  stated that ifsuch an energy policy were developed and implemented,  there would be noneed for oil production from environmentally  sensitive offshore areas.Alternatively, many suggested leasing only  if the national energy policyclearly showed the need for additional  offshore oil and gas production. In general, the contention was made that the Federal Government  shouldtake an aggressive leadership role in establishing a  comprehensive energypolicy with strong emphasis on energy  conservation. Greater reliance onalternative energy sources,  together with a renewed national commitmentto the development of  renewable energy resources, was also recommended.Specific  suggestions for new federal initiatives included the following:<ITAG tagnum="25">Increase fuel efficiency standards for new motor vehicles  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Improve energy conservation in buildings by installing more  efficientlighting and  appliances   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Reduce heat loss in buildings by improving wall insulation and  installingwindows with better heat retention properties  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Reestablish tax credits for investments in energy conservation  measures </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Lower gasoline demand by encouraging the use of alternative  fuels,such as methanol, ethanol, electricity, and compressed  natural gas  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Promote educational programs to create a national  consciousness aboutenergy conservation in daily living </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Increase Federal funding for renewable energy Randamp;D programs,  includingsolar, wind, and ocean energy  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Promote increased use of mass transit in urban areas  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Encourage changes in urban land use planning to reduce  commutingdistances</ITAG>In addition to policies designed to limit oil consumption, the  Task Forcewas provided a number of specific policy  recommendations relating to theOCS areas under consideration.  These suggestions included:<ITAG tagnum="25">Preserve OCS oil resources in their natural state as a reserve  tobe produced in the event  of a future energy emergency  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Instead of seeking new OCS production, revitalize the domestic  oilproduction industry  in well-developed oil producing areas where  explorationand production have been reduced and existing wells  have been pluggedor  abandoned  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Develop fully oil resources in OCS areas that currently have  onshoresupport facilities  and can accommodate further development without  undueenvironmental risks</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-18827 Filed 8-10-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4310-MR-M </ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
