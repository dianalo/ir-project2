The selection of prime contractors is a big step forward for the controversial space station, which will be NASA's biggest and most expensive project. But the future of the proposed station, which carries symbolic as well as practical value for the agency, remains clouded because of federal budget woes and disputes over whether the station is really needed and how it should be used.    The space station, as envisioned by NASA, would function as a giant orbiting laboratory 300 miles from the Earth, and would serve as a jumping-off point for flights to other planets. Construction of the station would begin in 1994, and it would be manned continuously from 1996. The station's basic design -- Phase I -- already has been approved by the Reagan administration, but it isn't clear whether Congress will approve it. Phase II, which would expand the station, would have to be approved by another administration.    The contracts for space-station hardware will total $5 billion for Phase I, and an additional $1.5 billion will be needed if NASA goes ahead with the second phase.    The companies whose proposals were chosen yesterday now enter negotiations with NASA for final contracts covering the first phase. The dollar figures cited reflect the companies' proposals; NASA officials say the final contracts may have different figures.    NASA selected teams led by these companies:    --McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Co. of Huntington Beach, Calif., and Houston, for a $1.9 billion contract to build the framework, propulsion, navigation and communications systems and two air locks for the first phase of the station. The company has proposed doing additional work for the second stage for $140 million.    --Boeing Aerospace Co. of Huntsville, Ala., for a $750 million contract for laboratory and living modules, air lock systems and environmental and life support systems for the first phase. For the second stage of the station, the company proposes a $25 million contract.    --General Electric's Astro-Space Division in Valley Forge, Pa., and East Windsor, N.J., for an $800 million contract for a free-flying, unmanned platform that will carry scientific instruments, and for the development of a satellite-servicing facility. GE has proposed doing additional work for the second phase of the station for $570 million.    --Rockwell's Rocketdyne Division of Canoga Park, Calif., for the station's power system, at an estimated cost of $1.6 billion. Rocketdyne has proposed doing work on the second stage for $740 million.    Martin Marietta Corp. was beaten out by Boeing for the contract for laboratory and living modules, and Rockwell International lost out to McDonnell Douglas for the framework, propulsion and navigation systems contract.    The Louisiana congressional delegation had pushed hard for Martin Marietta, which has a big facility in New Orleans, but NASA Administrator James Fletcher said that Boeing was the &quot;clear winner&quot; when the two proposals were compared. He declined to explain why, saying he owed it to Martin Marietta officials to discuss it with them first. In a statement, Martin Marietta said it was &quot;disappointed&quot; that it wasn't selected, but praised NASA for moving forward with the contract awards.    The contracts announced yesterday are for all major hardware for the first phase of the space station. NASA estimates the first stage will cost a total of $14.6 billion in current dollars, but outside analysts, adding in certain costs that NASA doesn't count, have put the estimate at least $10 billion higher.    Such stratospheric numbers spook some in Congress, which hasn't made a final decision on how much to spend on the station during the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. Some lawmakers say the station should be delayed or scrapped. And the recent budget pact with the White House makes it certain that NASA will get less than the $650 million or so it expected.    Nevertheless, Mr. Fletcher told reporters that &quot;our guess is that there will be enough to go ahead with these contracts,&quot; which could generate as many as 12,000 jobs nationally. But he added that if NASA faces a big cut, all four contracts will have to be reduced by &quot;some percentage.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
