There probably is one each of everything amid the pineywoods and bald mountain reaches of this state, but only that.America's political season starts in a corner of the countrythat is still remarkably homogeneous and still is remote, notonly geographically but culturally.</LP><TEXT>   New Hampshire is, as anyone born, reared or educated herewill tell you, different. That's the magic of the place.There's something in the wolf-winds, or in the stony fields,or in the mountain fastnesses, that sets it apart. Somethingin the tax code, too: There's no broad-based sales or incometax here.   Even so, it's a strange place to hold the preliminaries ofthe presidential campaign. Pretending that New Hampshire islike the rest of the country is a little like pretending --as George Bush is doing up here, to great amusement -- thatthe president is like the common man.   The nation is about 12% black; African-Americansconstitute about half of one percent of New Hampshire'spopulation. Three out of five households are headed bymarried couples here, far above the national average. &quot;Thisis a demographic version of the 1950s Chevrolet ads -- it'swhat a lot of people wish we were but aren't,&quot; says KayMussell, who teaches American Studies at the AmericanUniversity in Washington, D.C. &quot;Demographically it's out ofsynch with the electorate at large.&quot;   But the presidential race starts here, in a setting thatearly explorers noted for its &quot;goodly groves and woods andsundry sorts of beasts, but no people.&quot; The groves, woods andbeasts are still here, only slightly the worse for wear, butnow the state has a million people and it is something of aforce in high technology. Most of the state is now evenwithin range of television signals, though in some housesaround here the ABC station comes in downstairs but notupstairs.   But while it may not be like the rest of the country, NewHampshire isn't what you think either.   In the past two decades the state has grown by about 50%.A decade ago Derry, N.H., had a population of under 20,000and governed itself the traditional way, with a town meetingwhere everyone had the chance to crowd into the hall, raisehis hand, speak his mind and cast his vote on matters big andsmall. Now the city, where Robert Frost himself once livedand farmed, has a population of about 30,000 and hasabandoned the town meeting for a mayor and council.   The workers of Hillsborough County, in southern NewHampshire, used to toil in the mills of Nashua andManchester, one of the most formidable industrial areas inthe world. Now most of them get in their cars and drive intoMassachusetts, many to the technology corridor of Route 128.   The result, says former Republican attorney general ThomasRath, is that the character of the region has beentransformed. &quot;We have changed from a manufacturing economy toa service economy, and a lot of the people who live here areonly in the state during the eight to 12 hours during whichthey eat and sleep,&quot; he says. &quot;They are not part of thetraditional ethos of the state.&quot;   New Hampshire, moreover, is not the insulated ruralredoubt it used to be. In the old days, there were colorfulconservatives such as Meldrim Thomson, who made his mark withhis own maple syrup that he boiled in the sugar house up onMount Cube. Mr. Thomson was elected to three terms asgovernor with his &quot;ax the tax&quot; mantra but is best knownnationally for thinking about equipping the National Guardwith nuclear weapons. The late William Loeb, the fiery editorof the Manchester Union Leader, referred to PresidentEisenhower as &quot;Dopey Dwight,&quot; called President Ford &quot;Jerrythe Jerk&quot; and described Oliver Wendell Holmes as an &quot;oldgoat.&quot;   The growth has had its costs. There are malls in the statenow, though one of the biggest actually has its parking lotin Massachusetts, and there are some truly awful real-estatedevelopments, many of them just about empty right now.Candidates are seldom asked to clutch a squealing roosterclose to their breast, as Sen. Robert Taft was in 1952, anincident that prompted the most searing scowl in the state'shistory.   But not all is lost. The state still has a hometownfeeling to it. A remarkable number of people have their firstnames on their license plates. You can still buy anythingfrom a snow plow to a cutlery set at Nichols Hardware in Lyme-- and come away with advice about how to clean either ofthem. The other day the president of Dartmouth Collegestrolled over to the press room in the state capitol inConcord and told the political reporter for the Union Leaderthat he still remembers his wife as the prettiest girl in hisclass at Manchester Central High.   ---   Mr. Shribman, a member of the Journal's Washington bureau,covers national politics.</TEXT></DOC>
