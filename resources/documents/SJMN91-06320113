Instead of focusing on the controversial discoverer,however, Adams explored the dream of finding a gilded paradise here,implicitly contrasting that dream with the current ravaging of our planet, oneof Adams' stated concerns.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Eye  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  'EL DORADO' LEADS THE WAY TO PARADISE IN DAVIESHALL  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  REVIEW;  PERFORMANCE;  SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT (publ. 11/16/91, pg. 2C); Because of an editor's error, a caption in Friday's eye was incorrect.

It is so beautifully crafted in a style that is both familiar andmonumental that it likely will be performed and recorded often.;    Snobs mayscoff at Adams' tried-and-true writing. There's the familiar crescendoingpulse in the opening movement (&quot;Bolero,&quot; anyone?), and the closing movementforays into Sibelius-tinged orchestration, New Age sounds, and the Steve Reichstyle of phase-shift music begun a generation ago.;    But Adams, 44, remainsone of the champion colorists of the late 20th century. His minimalism formaximum orchestra is awe- inspiring, and in &quot;El Dorado&quot; he creates gildedpyramids of thoroughly consonant sound.;    While most symphonic composers arestill uncomfortable with electronic music, Adams is as much at ease with it aswith the full instrumental array on stage, which, for &quot;El Dorado,&quot; included anarmy of eight percussionists and heavy brass.;    His signal breakthrough inthis piece is the idiomatic integration of two synthesizers into theorchestral texture. They spray their fine mist of exotic timbres and pitchesthrough the hall via 10 loudspeakers.;    Clearly Adams has broken through thecomputer-phobia rampant at symphonies around the country, and it is high time.Now any young symphonic composer who doesn't learn to use the synthesizer willbe ill prepared to create 21st-century music.;    The rest of the programconsisted of an Adams orchestration of a piece by Liszt, and two Stravinskyworks. I was far more impressed with Adams' version of Liszt's &quot;The BlackGondola&quot; this week than in hearing it at the Cabrillo Music Festival threemonths ago. The funereal piece shone Wednesday, illuminated by the expertplayers and a more vibrant hall.;    The original Liszt composition was forcello and piano. Adams' orchestration incorporates a lot of low instruments --English horn, violas and bass clarinet -- and does so exquisitely. Toward theend, it employs a celestial choir of cellos. This highly sophisticated,pictorial piece contrasts markedly with some vacuous Liszt works heard all toooften. It was deliciously chromatic -- and moving, too.;    As a conductor,Adams has his strong and weak points. &quot;El Dorado&quot; seemed by far the mostsuccessful effort Wednesday. In the two Stravinsky pieces, he blunted theaccents and sapped much of their energy.;    In the prickly Stravinsky ViolinConcerto, however, soloist Stephanie Chase, formerly of the Bay Area, gave amore exciting reading than I have ever heard. I'm baffled why Chase has notsoloed with more of our major orchestras. After melting the hall with thesoulful &quot;Aria II,&quot; she gave a masterful version of the tricky finale.;    Thehall needed all the melting it could get. Apparently cool to contemporarymusic this fall, patrons stayed away in droves, just as they did for the&quot;Pulcinella&quot; program conducted by visiting Baltimore Symphony music directorDavid Zinman two weeks ago.;    The other Stravinsky work, the whimsical operaexcerpt &quot;The Song of the Nightingale,&quot; opened the program. But this time thenightingale was sedate, with no punch.;    The concert will be broadcast Nov.26 at 8 p.m. on KKHI radio.;  San Francisco Symphony; World premiere of JohnAdams 'El Dorado,' conducted by the composer; Where: Davies Symphony Hall, VanNess Avenue at Grove Street, San Francisco; When: 8:30 tonight-Saturday;Tickets: $22-$48; Call: (415) 431-5400  </TEXT><BYLINE>  PAUL HERTELENDY, Mercury News Music Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  San Francisco  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911115  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  22  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  695  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday, November 15, 199100320113,SJ1  </DATELINE><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
