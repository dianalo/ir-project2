The progress recently made in East-West relations has given newimpetus to the arms control process and has enhanced thepossibilities of achieving the alliance's arms control objectives,which complement the other elements of the alliance's securitypolicy.</TEXT><NOTE>PRINCIPLES OF ALLIANCE SECURITY</NOTE><TEXT>   Alliance security policy aims to preserve peace in freedom byboth political means and the maintenance of a military capabilitysufficient to prevent war and to provide for effective defense. Thefact that the Alliance has for forty years safeguarded peace inEurope bears witness to the success of this policy.   Improved political relations and the progressive development ofcooperative structures between Eastern and Western countries areimportant components of alliance policy. ...   In underlining the importance of these facts for the formulationof alliance policy, the Allies reaffirm that ... the search forconstructive dialogue and cooperation with the countries of theEast, including arms control and disarmament, is based on politicalsolidarity and adequate military strength.   From its inception the alliance of Western democracies has beendefensive in purpose. This will remain so. None of our weapons willever be used except in self-defense. The alliance does not seekmilitary superiority nor will it ever do so. ...   Consistent with the alliance's defensive character, its strategyis one of deterrence. ... For the foreseeable future, deterrencerequires an appropriate mix of adequate and effective nuclear andconventional forces which will continue to be kept up to date wherenecessary; for it is only by their evident and perceived capabilityfor effective use that such forces and weapons deter.   Within this overall framework, strategic nuclear forces providethe ultimate guarantee of deterrence for the Allies. They must becapable of inflicting unacceptable damage on an aggressor stateeven after it has carried out a first strike. ... The strategicnuclear forces of the United States provide the cornerstone ofdeterrence for the Alliance as a whole.   Nuclear forces below the strategic level provide an essentialpolitical and military linkage between conventional and strategicforces and, together with the presence of Canadian and the UnitedStates forces in Europe, between the European and North Americanmembers of the alliance. The Allies' sub-strategic nuclear forcesare not designed to compensate for conventional imbalances. ...   All member countries of the Alliance strongly favor acomprehensive, effectively verifiable, global ban on thedevelopment, production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons....   The Allies are committed to maintaining only the minimum levelof forces necessary for their strategy of deterrence, taking intoaccount the threat. There is, however, a level of forces, bothnuclear and conventional, below which the credibility of deterrencecannot be maintained. In particular, the Allies have alwaysrecognized that the removal of all nuclear weapons from Europewould critically undermine deterrence strategy and impair thesecurity of the alliance.   The alliance's defense policy and its policy of arms control anddisarmament are complementary and have the same goal: to maintainsecurity at the lowest possible level of forces. There is nocontradiction between defense policy and arms control policy. ...</TEXT><NOTE>ARMS CONTROL AND DISARMAMENT: PRINCIPLES AND OBJECTIVES</NOTE><TEXT>   Our vision for Europe is that of an undivided continent wheremilitary forces only exist to prevent war and to ensureself-defense, as has always been the case for the Allies, not forthe purpose of initiating aggression or for political or militaryintimidation. Arms control can contribute to the realization ofthat vision as an integral part of the Alliance's security policyand of our overall approach to East-West relations.   ...
