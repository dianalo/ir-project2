The government announced Thursday it was willing to talk withstudents about their demands for greater freedom. But studentleaders rejected a stipulation that talks be conducted throughofficial student groups.   Protesters at most schools rejected the groups as non-democraticand formed their own unions, which the government says are illegal.   Student leaders from several schools met today to discussstrategy.   ``We talked about the march but didn't come to any decisions,''one leader at Beijing Normal University said on condition ofanonymity. ``Right now we are savoring this victory. We have madethe Communist Party bend.''   Wang Dan, a student leader at Beijing University, said theyhoped the talks would be held soon and wanted to meet Premier LiPeng.   ``He is the leader of the government, and he should hear all theviews of the citizens,'' he said.   Newspapers throughout China carried a Xinhua News Agency storysaying only 30,000 students marched Thursday.   But the 20-mile march through the streets of Beijing drew morethan 150,000 students, workers and city residents calling for afree press and political reforms. It was communist China's largestprotest in modern times and lasted 15 hours.   The march occurred after an editorial in the People's Dailycalled the student movement a ``chaotic disturbance'' and accusedstudents of being unpatriotic.   The unrest began after the death of ousted Communist Partyleader Hu Yaobang on April 15. The party fired him in 1987 forfailing to crack down on pro-democracy demonstrations in late 1986.   Protesters who led the march Thursday carried a poster saying:``Uphold the righteous leaders of the party.''   Significantly, today's Xinhua report did not accuse the studentsof wanting the overthrow of the government. Most students say theyonly want the leaders to do their job better and respect humanrights.   Television today showed the first footage of the march. Thereport also repeated warnings the protest was illegal andorganizers were breaking the law.   The People's Daily, the official Communist Party newspaper,published an overview of the two weeks of protests, apparently topacify students.   The article denied students had been beaten in Beijing last weekwhen they staged a sit-in at the gates of the Communist Partyheadquarters. An Associated Press reporter saw police hit at leastsix students.   The article also attempted to dispel a rumor that a femalestudent had been killed. The woman, it said, was hit by a car asshe returned from the protest. Many students believe police killedher, although it appeared the newspaper's account was correct.   The country' most liberal newspaper, the Shanghai World EconomicHerald, resumed publication today after the city government firedits chief editor, Qin Benli, and installed in his place citypropaganda official Liu Ji.   Today's issue is an altered version of a withheld April 24edition, which carried six pages honoring Hu.   ``The items the government said were likely to causedisturbances have been taken out,'' one of the paper's editors said.   During Thursday's march, tens of thousands of Beijing residentsescorted students on bicycles and on foot, and tried to shield themfrom soldiers and police.   ``We're opening a road for them,'' said one worker, after hehelped push through a line of officers.   Police had issued harsh warnings against marches, but thesecurity forces were unarmed and they gave up after pushing matchesfailed to stop advancing demonstrators.   Students say they plan another march May 4, the 70th anniversaryof China's first student movement for democracy. The movement grewout of students' opposition to Japan's territorial advances inChina after World War I but developed into a quest for broaderpolitical goals, including democracy.</TEXT></DOC>
