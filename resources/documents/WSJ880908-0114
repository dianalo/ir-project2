As a result, the company said it expects to report a loss for its second quarter ended Aug. 26, instead of the previously expected break-even results. In the year-earlier second quarter, Lillian Vernon earned $356,000, or seven cents a share, on revenue of $20.7 million.    The company said that customer orders are well ahead of those a year earlier, but that a slow start-up at the Virginia facility delayed the rate of order shipments and hurt second-quarter results.    In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Lillian Vernon shares closed at $10.50, down 25 cents. The company went public at $15 a share a year ago.    For its first quarter ended May 27, the company earned $1 million, or 16 cents a share, on revenue of $25.9 million. </TEXT></DOC>
