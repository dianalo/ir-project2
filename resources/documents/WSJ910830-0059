According to numbers releasedyesterday by the Investment Company Institute, $3.7 billionpoured into stock funds during July. That's the biggestinflow in 14 months, and well ahead of June's $967 millioninflow.   (These numbers consist of new fund sales minusredemptions, plus the net result of switches between stockfunds and other funds in the same fund family. Reinvesteddividends are excluded.)   Mutual fund sales numbers are closely watched as a gaugeof small-investor sentiment. When investors buy mutual fundsin large numbers, as they have in recent months, that's seenas a warning sign because small investors are notorious forbuying heavily near stock and bond market peaks.   For market prognosticators, the Investment CompanyInstitute's latest data contains an additional piece ofworrisome information. The cash holdings of stock fundsdropped to 8.6% of assets in July, from 9% in June. The lasttime cash levels got that low was February 1986. Low cashlevels are considered a danger signal, because it meansthere's less money available to push stock prices higher.   &quot;If you're a historian, which many good investors are,then you should be nervous, particularly in a period when itlooks like the economy is in stagnation,&quot; says A. MichaelLipper, president of Lipper Analytical Services, a mutualfund research firm. &quot;If earnings don't improve soon, then theprice-earnings ratios are historically very high. If earningsdon't go up, then prices might come down.&quot;   The bond fund buying binge is being driven by a sharpdiscrepancy between the anemic yields on money market fundsand certificates of deposit and the more generous payoutsavailable on short-term bond funds and Government NationalMortgage Association bond funds.   At Scudder Stevens andamp; Clark, for instance, the company'sbond funds enjoyed record cash inflows during August, withthree-quarters of the money going into the fund group'sshort-term bond fund. The fund, which owns bonds with anaverage maturity of 2.7 years, yields 8.69%, well above the5.51% yield on Scudder's large taxable money fund.   &quot;You're getting very good extra return for yourincremental risk,&quot; argues Gavin Quill, a Scudder marketingresearch analyst. Investors clearly agree: Assets of theshort-term bond fund have ballooned to $1.1 billion from $335million at the end of 1990.   Vanguard Group's bond fund inflows during August surpassedJuly's record level, and Fidelity Investments says it toocould set a record this month. Other fund groups, such as T.Rowe Price Associates and TNE Fund Group, also report strongbond fund inflows, though they say the pace of sales slowedcompared with July.   Where's all the money coming from? National Securities andamp;Research Corp., a Greenwich, Conn., fund group, recentlyconducted a survey of 100 brokers and financial planners.&quot;What the survey bears out is that you have a large group ofpeople bringing money out of banks and insurance companiesand into mutual funds,&quot; says Robert Adler, who is presidentof National's sales organization.   Almost 90% of the brokers surveyed say they have recentlyseen investors switch money out of certificates of depositand into mutual funds. And 50% say their clients have beenmoving money into funds from insurance products. Among thefunds popular with these investors are better-quality bondfunds and the so-called balanced funds, which buy both stocksand bonds.   Major fund groups including Fidelity, T. Rowe Price andVanguard report a pickup in stock fund buying during August.&quot;The major source of sales has been the growth-and-incomefunds,&quot; says Michael Hines, a Fidelity marketing vicepresident. &quot;People are moving out of money funds and startingto get their feet wet in the equities.&quot;   Stock fund buying may slow in the months ahead, accordingto a survey done for Fidelity by the University of MichiganSurvey Research Center. The survey found that 18% of mutualfund investors plan to add to their stock fund holdings overthe next three months, down from 23% in July. These figuresreflect the percentage intending to buy stock funds minusthose planning to sell.   ---   ROGER MCNAMEE, manager of the highflying $160 million T.Rowe Price Science andamp; Technology Fund, is leaving to set up aprivate partnership that will invest in publicly traded andclosely held technology companies.   Since taking over the T. Rowe Price fund in September1988, Mr. McNamee has returned 99.9%, better than any othertechnology fund tracked by Lipper Analytical Services. Thisyear alone, the fund is up 44.1%.   Mr. McNamee was traveling yesterday and couldn't bereached for comment. A T. Rowe Price spokesman said thefund's management would be taken over by Charles Morris, atechnology analyst who has worked with Mr. McNamee for thepast three years.</TEXT></DOC>
