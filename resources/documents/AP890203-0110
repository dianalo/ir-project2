(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Kent County officials had no troubleturning down an offer by the federal government to help house thehomeless _ the government was offering an old military observationtower as a shelter.   The federal Department of Health and Human Services recentlynotified county officials that they could lease the abandoned towerfor the homeless. It's 80 feet tall, devoid of heat, electricity orrunning water and situated in a remote part of the county.   ``It's ludicrous,'' said county administrator William H. Landon.``I can't believe anybody ever bothered to take a look at thething.'' The largely rural county has few problems with homelessanyway, officials said.   ``If we had any homeless, we certainly wouldn't take them downthere and put them in an 80-foot tower, not if we had their bestinterests at heart,'' said county commission President Alexander P.Rasin III.   A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Housing and UrbanDevelopment said Thursday that the notice to the county may havebeen an error.   ``We've been getting a lot of calls about things like this,''said the spokesman, William A. Glavin. ``Either properties are tooremote or they somehow wouldn't work.''   A federal judge in Washington ordered HUD to determine which ofmore than 300 surplus government properties could be used to shelterthe homeless under the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Actof 1987. The ruling resulted from a lawsuit brought by homelessadvocates.   HUD officials had only a month to determine which surplus sitesshould be offered and gathered information by sending questionnairesabout the properties to other federal agencies. It is unlikely thatanyone from HUD actually visited the tower or contacted localofficials about it until now, Glavin said.   The 1940s-era steel tower was used by the U.S. Army as anobservation platform during gun tests at Aberdeen Proving Ground.</TEXT></DOC>
