Klinck andamp;Associates conducted a study of major Centrex users.andP;  In that study 50% ofthe users rated Centrex &quot;excellent.&quot;andP;  And major improvements have been madein Centrex since then, the biggest one being lower prices.andM;The things those Centrex users like back in 1985 are still good reasons tolike Centrex today.andM;* Reliability was the factor most cited in the study.andP;  With certain dramaticexceptions, service from your local telco is pretty reliable.andP;  their switcheshave backups and fail-safes all over the place and they are supposed to beattended 24 hours a day in case of trouble.andM;* Off-Site Support was another popular reason for liking Centrex.andP;  Face it,not every company wants to become expert in telecommunications -- or hireone.andM;* Ease of Expansion/Contraction was another biggie.andP;  Centrex works on the&quot;pay for what you use&quot; principle.andP;  A good idea for rapidly growing companies(and those with uncertain futures).andM;* Effective Service was cited by 20% of the users in the study.andP;  After all,there is someone standing right next to the switch who can fix things theminute they go wrong.andM;* No Capital Investment was listed by 15% of the users as a reason to likeCentrex.andM;* Ease of Use was listed by another 15%.andP;  When you get down to it all youreally need is a plain old 2500 set to use Centrex.andP;  We guess that's prettyeasy to use.andM;* Multiple Building Coverage was cited by 15%, as many as the other two.andO;That's kind of a surprise, since this is one of the really neat things aboutCentrex.andM;As long as all your locations are covered by a single central office you canall share the same Centrex system.andP;  Transfers between building locations aretransparent to internal and external callers alike.andP;  It's just like you wereall under one roof -- for your phone service, anyway.andM;ISDN was barely a twinkle in those users' eyes back in 1985, but it's nowconsidered a good reason to change to or stick with Centrex.andP;  Digital Centrexusers already are using many of ISDN's benefits.andP;  And when ISDN comes to thelocal loop, Centrex users will be sitting in the catbird seat.andM;But Centrex isn't perfect.andP;  (What is?)andP;  Manufacturers of Centrex CPE havebeen busy filling the little gaps and special needs of Centrex users (as youwill see on the following pages).andP;  Here are some common Centrex complaintsand the CPE that can remedy the problem.andM;I can't remember all those feature codes.andM;A feature phone with programmable keys will solve this problem.andP;  Program injust the features you use and forget the rest.andP;  Key systems will also provideyou with the programmable keys or other means to access those features withjust one or two key strokes.andP;  The feature-phone also give you a speakerphoneand other perks.andM;All those unanswered phones just don't cut the mustard in my department.andP;  Wewant to cover each other's phones.andM;This is where the key system behind Centrex comes in.andM;Our main attendant needs to pick up the main company numbers and coverunanswered calls to individuals.andM;Centrex CPE manufacturers have come up with all kinds of Centrex answeringconsoles to fill in this little gap in the Centrex concept.andM;I dread when the company's main attendant answers my calls.andP;  The messages Iget aren't really helpful and my callers get confused by the unfamiliargreeting.andM;There are a couple of products on the market that will deliver all kinds ofinformation about you -- how you like your phone answered, how messagesshould be taken -- to the attendant along with your forwarded call.andM;We would like to put an automated attendant at our main number.andP;  And we'retired of waiting for voice mail.andM;There are a number of companies whose call processing systems are fullyintegrated with Centrex.andM;I want to be able to do my own call accounting.andM;The traditional way to use a call accounting system behind Centrex is to usea tip and ring scanner to create the SMDR data that will be used by the callaccounting system.andP;  This is still a viable solution.andM;There are some manufacturers out there though that are going straight to thesource for the call information.andP;  These packages integrate with the systemsthat create the SMDR at the Centrex switch.andP;  The info is delivered to yourown system with a private line with a modem at both ends.andM;If there is something about your Centrex system that bugs you, study the nextfew pages.andP;  We are willing to bet the someone out there is ready to fulfillall of your Centrex desires.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
