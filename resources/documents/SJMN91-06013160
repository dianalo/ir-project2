Since it's coming to court Tuesday, we'llreplay it: Byron Pipkin and Greg Yoder, two candidates who finished out of therunning for the two four-year seats on the San Jose Unified School Districtboard, have brought the suit. They're alleging that one of the winners, LouisK. &quot;Bud&quot; Towner, should be disqualified. Their reason? They say Towner did notlive in the district -- and that his real home was at 1054 Mitchell Court inCampbell.;    Towner disputes this charge, calling it &quot;sour grapes.&quot; He toldour reporter Bill Romano that he moved to his mother-in-law's home at 1070Glenbrook Avenue in Willow Glen last August. While he acknowledges owning theMitchell Court property, he says his residence is in San Jose. And he haschanged his voter registration to reflect that. But not every authority gotthe message. The DMV still lists Towner on Mitchell Court. County records showhe still enjoys a homeowner's exemption there. The San Jose post office, whichdelivers to Mitchell Court, shows no change of address for Towner. And Pipkinand Yoder say that neighbors have told them that Towner continues to live onMitchell.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Perspective  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  I AIN'T NO WANDERIN' MAN  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  The Insider  </MEMO><TEXT>     Whether this is enough to invalidate Towner's election will depend on thelegal interpretation of residency. But Pipkin, a Sunnyvale public safetylieutenant who finished third after Towner and Rich Couser, says the principleis particularly important with the onset of district elections. &quot;If we can'tkeep out someone who's not even in the district, how are they going to keepfive people in their proper districts?&quot; he asked.; TOLD BRIEFLY;    A few bitsand pieces: Deborah Larson, the City of San Jose's finance director, quit lastweek, saying she had accomplished what she intended and needed time to writeand paint. You may remember that her wedding to chief budget analyst GregLarson was one of City Hall's major social events last year . . . CatherinePandori, the wife of new council member David Pandori, showed up at the year'sfirst council meeting last Tuesday with the couple's 11-day-old son . . .Expect to see a major zoo outside the new Hall of Justice on Hedding Streetwhen it opens tomorrow. The powers-that-be have built the courthouse beforefinishing the parking garage across the street. . . . You may wonder why theSusan Hammer inauguration went off so smoothly last Monday. It's because theceremony was rehearsed word for word. Little circles were even drawn for theparticipants to stand in. A production of Roger Lee and Carol Beddo, who wereeverywhere with their walkie-talkies  . . Wittingly or unwittingly, the newmayor snubbed her predecessor, Tom McEnery. Hammer introduced a host ofelected officials, including San Francisco Art Agnos. She neglected to mentionMcEnery. It couldn't have been a payback for his lack of endorsement. Couldit?; BREACH OF ETIQUETTE;    Has the move for term limits reached a bit of abarrier? After San Jose and the state of California imposed term limits lastNovember, Councilman Norm Shaskey of Mountain View, a self-styled populist,figured he could start a movement to do the same for the Board of Supervisors.He figured wrong. At a council meeting Tuesday, Shaskey put forward aresolution asking the supes to put a two-consecutive-term-limit measure beforevoters. It is an idea that may not sit well with, say, Supervisor Rod Diridon,the senior member of the board, in his fifth term. Shaskey also wanted to askother cities to sign up. But the motion died for lack of a second. SaidMountain View Councilwoman Pat Figueroa: &quot;There was no interest in it. I haveno idea why he chose to put it on. It hit us as a great big surprise.&quot;; BUY ATTHE RACK;    If you've been following the recent musical chairs game with thevalley's bureaucrats, you could make a persuasive case that the move of citymanager Thomas Frutchey from Los Altos Hills to Campbell was simply a careerstep upward. When he took the $90,000 job early this month, Frutchey, 41,praised Campbell as a place that has &quot;has real community feeling and spirit,based on traditional values.&quot; It's no secret in Los Altos Hills, however, thatFrutchey regularly clashed with the Mizz Nordstrom of the town council, ToniCasey. You may remember her as the one who suggested a while back that thetown government should emulate Nordstrom's standard of service. &quot;There's beena feeling that Tom can't get anything done,&quot; said one of our sources. &quot;He'sfrustrated personally.&quot; Frutchey, incidentally, is the second high-rankingtown official to depart recently: City Planner Ann Jamison is also gone.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  The Insider is compiled by Mercury News reporters.
