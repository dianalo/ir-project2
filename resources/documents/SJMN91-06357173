With the defeat of Mayor Art Agnos, SanFrancisco's prospects of building a new stadium are dead for now. And withDenver and Miami acquiring expansion teams, the Giants have few suitorsremaining. That could help San Jose. It also could make Giants owner Bob Lurienervous enough to bolt for St. Petersburg.;   Projecting a $20 million citydeficit for next year and determined to avoid an arena-like cost-overrunalbatross for Mayor Susan Hammer, San Jose officials have a tight grip ontheir checkbook, insisting on stadium revenue to cover the city's ground rentand other costs.;   But the Giants, with player salaries up and attendancedown, are less generous than they were in 1990 with Santa Clara. They want acontract like the Sharks hockey franchise has at the arena, but the city isreluctant to equate the arena with the much larger stadium. Each side saysit's the other's move.;   Time's running out. Hammer andamp; Co. need a deal notmuch later than Jan. 1 if they're to put it before voters in an April specialelection. Voter approval is far from assured, given economic hard times;ironically, the election would occur April 14, the eve of income tax day, whenpeople may be less than eager to saddle themselves with a 2 percent utilitytax or the equivalent -- about $30 a year.;   Or Hammer could wait until June,when the ballot will be more crowded and the turnout higher. Either way, heradvisers are loathe to expose the mayor to a loss at the polls, and the Giantslikewise have no stomach for a third Bay Area rejection. They would wait for aJune vote, but not for an election in November.;   Hammer hopes to sell thestadium as economic development. She can't, without a deal voters willrecognize as favorable for the city. If the Giants want to stay in the BayArea, they need to acknowledge that the city's in a political bind, andbargain accordingly.;   Even if that happens, no one knows whetherrecession-weary voters will pay $2.50 a month to build a stadium.;   Here'shoping it works, despite the odds. San Jose is becoming a major, first-classcity. We don't require the Giants for that, but they certainly would helpstrengthen family entertainment, community identity and civic pride.;   Arethere more urgent needs in a recession? Sure. My colleagues write about someon this page. But I say we can have baseball, too -- and if we don't thistime, it'll be a long, long time before there's another chance.;    (hbox);For regional government, on the other hand, 1992 will not be amake-it-or-break-it year.;   Despite endless talk in 1991, don't expect citiesor counties to vanish in '92, sucked into some monstrous new megagovernment.That's not even under discussion.;   A far less grandiose merger of obscureregional agencies that deal with air quality, transportation and planning maybe in the cards. But it won't happen next year, nor will it mean much unlessthe merged entity gets power to make major zoning decisions, and to imposerevenue sharing on cities -- controversial ideas still on the back burner.;  And yet, despite a thousand obstacles, an impressive assortment of folks arediscussing Bay Vision 2020, the regional proposal for the Bay Area. Theyinclude major corporations demanding more housing for employees, developersdying to build those houses, and environmentalists who'll support urbandevelopment if the plan guarantees open space between cities. Caught in themiddle are city and county politicians, some scared to death of the scheme,others out to co-opt it.;   New for '92 will be the state's ante in this pokergame. Gov. Pete Wilson will play his hand in his State of the State speech inJanuary. He may be so distracted by California's money woes that he folds onthe regional question; or, if he chooses, the governor can lay out a stateframework to which regional efforts would have to conform.;   Meanwhile, StateSen. Rebecca Q. Morgan -- like Wilson a Republican -- is drafting a bill toimplement the BV2020 plan, but doesn't expect a vote until 1993.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Rob Elder column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911222  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7P  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  DRAWING  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  816  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday, December 22, 199100357173,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
