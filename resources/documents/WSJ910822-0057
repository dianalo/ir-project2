He tried first to reach his friend and ally, MikhailGorbachev, but the Kremlin operator was unable to connect theWhite House to the ousted Soviet leader, then under housearrest in the Crimea. Then Mr. Bush called Boris Yeltsin, theoutspoken Russian leader he once wasn't eager to embrace butwho had emerged as the focus of the West's hopes forreversing the &quot;coup d'etat&quot;, then in its second day.</LP><TEXT>   Minutes later, Mr. Bush stepped into the White House RoseGarden and publicly embraced Mr. Yeltsin's effort to turnback the tanks menacing the Russian Parliament building. Thecoup collapsed so quickly in the 24 hours that followed thatMr. Bush yesterday could walk outside his vacation home on awet, gray afternoon and declare with evident relief: &quot;It's avery good day.&quot;   The combination of skill and luck that brought Mr. Bushthrough the crisis in Moscow strengthened his alreadyformidable re-election prospects against a weak potentialDemocratic field, which shrank yet again when Sen. AlbertGore (D., Tenn.) said he wouldn't run for president in 1992.By underscoring the volatility of international events, theepisode further crippled the chances of any Democratsthinking of joining the race.   &quot;The Persian Gulf raised the importance of `commander inchief' in the presidential job description; the Soviet crisisraises the profile of `international statesman,'&quot; says GeoffGarin, a Democratic pollster. &quot;Both of those make it a jobthat is tailor-made for George Bush. More than any presidentsince Richard Nixon, {Mr.} Bush is seen as uniquely qualifiedin foreign affairs.&quot;   Republican Gov. Pete Wilson of California says the crisisshould strengthen Mr. Bush at home. &quot;Though it had a two-daylife, the Soviet coup reconfirmed a very high comfort levelthat people have with {Mr.} Bush as president,&quot; Gov. Wilsonsays. &quot;Nothing is permanent in politics, but this was avalidating and reinforcing time for him.&quot;   To be sure, if the aftermath of this week's Soviet crisisis chaotic and if there is no other big foreign-policy issueover the next year, the public's attention may shift back todomestic matters, where Mr. Bush is the weakest. But, fornow, Democrats are in real political retreat.   &quot;President Bush emerges as leader of the Free World, he'scalling everybody on the phone again, coordinating thestrategy. So it's a political plus clearly for thepresident,&quot; says Sen. Richard Lugar (R., Ind.).   Just two days ago, it wasn't clear that the crisis wouldburnish the president's reputation at all. The coup hadappeared to undercut Mr. Bush's hopes to forge a new worldorder alongside Mr. Gorbachev, and the president's initialresponse from his Maine vacation home was tepid: describingthe &quot;putsch&quot; as &quot;extra-constitutional,&quot; but neithercondemning it nor endorsing Mr. Yeltsin's call for a generalstrike.   As they reconstructed events, White House aides ascribedMr. Bush's initial stance to a lack of information. Thepresident adopted a tougher line after he returned toWashington on Monday afternoon and consulted with nationalsecurity advisers who had been monitoring the Yeltsin-ledopposition. Shortly after 6 p.m. EDT, the White House issueda two-page statement in Mr. Bush's name that condemned thecoup and backed Mr. Yeltsin's call for Mr. Gorbachev's returnto power.   By 7:15 the next morning, aides found Mr. Bush in his OvalOffice study typing a list of things for the administrationto do: assemble a list of U.S. options; include SouthAmerican leaders in consultations to demonstrate consensusthroughout the Western hemisphere; avoid reacting topolitical jibes from Democrats and Republican conservatives.Most important was his decision to call Mr. Yeltsin, who hadearlier appealed for U.S. support in a call to U.S. charged'affaires Jim Collins in Moscow.   Mr. Bush's prior relations with Mr. Yeltsin, a flamboyantleader often viewed as a threat to Mr. Gorbachev's power,were awkward. But Mr. Yeltsin made it easy for Mr. Bush tohelp by declaring that Mr. Yeltsin's effort was in Mr.Gorbachev's name, as well as by climbing a tank to call forpopular resistance. &quot;Flamboyance is a very positive qualityas you climb up there and encourage your people,&quot; Mr. Bushsaid.   After phoning Mr. Yeltsin, President Bush reviewed withtop aides an 11-page, single-spaced list of possible U.S.responses prepared by a committee led by Deputy NationalSecurity Adviser Robert Gates. There was a consensus that allof the economic programs listed would be put on hold. But Mr.Bush cited three areas where he wanted links to continue: Hewanted to proceed with two arms control treaties that thecoup plotters had opposed and he wished to avoid a cutoff ofU.S. grain sales reminiscent of President Carter's 1979embargo following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Mr.Bush then announced the Yeltsin phone call to reporters anddispatched the freshly sworn-in U.S. ambassador, RobertStrauss, to &quot;get the lay of the land&quot; in Moscow.   The landscape shifted with breathtaking speed. Though Mr.Bush and his aides had emphasized the administration'slimited influence, they could hardly have hoped for asmoother end to the crisis. It was capped at 12:19 yesterdayafternoon when Mr. Bush, called home by the Coast Guard froma boat ride, received a call from Mr. Gorbachev expressinggratitude for U.S. support and reporting that &quot;things areunder control.&quot; Aides described the president as moved by the20-minute conversation.   Political analysts predicted that the outcome, just sixmonths after the U.S.-led victory in the Persian Gulf War, iscertain to boost the president's already-high public approvalratings and widen the stature gap over his Democraticopposition. &quot;Bush on foreign policy has been a mountain goat,jumping from one high point to another,&quot; says Stephen Hess ofthe Brookings Institution. &quot;When you think of the need forleadership in a dangerous world, the names of Bill Clintonand Paul Tsongas and Tom Harkin don't come to mind.&quot;   Democrats and Republican conservatives offered somecriticism of Mr. Bush's performance, nonetheless. Rep. DaveMcCurdy (D., Okla.), chairman of the House IntelligenceCommittee, faulted the administration for having ignoredintelligence warnings of the possibility of a coup and forbanking their hopes for Soviet reform on Mr. Gorbachevinstead of Mr. Yeltsin and other leaders of the Sovietrepublics.   &quot;The president has proven that he can manage crises, butit's even more important to be able to prevent them,&quot; saysMark Mellman, a Democratic consultant. Moreover, Democratsexpressed the hope that the short-lived coup would fadequickly from public consciousness, leaving plenty of timebefore November 1992 for the party to shift attention to themore promising terrain of an uncertain economy and socialproblems such as health care.   But Merle Black, an Emory University political scientist,speculated that only a severe economic downturn could makethe president vulnerable. &quot;It will be a slow turn&quot; back topublic attention on domestic issues, concedes Democraticconsultant Harrison Hickman: &quot;Until it does, we'll be at adisadvantage. We've had better days.&quot;   ---   David Shribman contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
