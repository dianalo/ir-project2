It has been less than one year since America's launch industry entered the commercial market, and in that short time, our firms have won seven satellite launching contracts originally booked with Ariane. They also have reservations for 17 additional payloads.    Further, most of Ariane's bookings in 1991 and beyond are on the Ariane 4, a rocket that has yet to make its first operational flight. In fact, since its first mission in 1979, Ariane has achieved an overall success rate of 79% (four failures out of 19) compared with the U.S.'s record of at least 94%, accumulated over almost 30 years and hundreds of launches.    Finally, it is not news that Ariane benefited from the Challenger accident by picking up a number of customers. On the contrary, even when the Space Shuttle was actively competing for satellites at subsidized rates, Ariane maintained almost the same share of the international launch market that it enjoys today.    What is newsworthy is that in the past six months alone, U.S. firms, responding to market forces, are making significant inroads into the commercial market in record time. The only ones not surprised by this are those in the administration who have supported the president's commercial space launch policy all along.    Courtney A.
