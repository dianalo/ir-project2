Seib (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> FREST </CO><G> EXE </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Reagan said the U.S. will accept a plan calling for the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan -- a development that helps clear the way for an upbeat superpower summit in Moscow at the end of May.    The agreement, negotiated by Afghan and Pakistani officials in Geneva, already is being attacked by U.S. conservatives because it doesn't force the Soviets to curb their aid to the Afghan regime, doesn't create a new Afghan government that includes Afghan resistance forces and doesn't call for a cease-fire in the Afghan civil war.    For the time being, Secretary of State George Shultz said, the U.S. will reserve its right to continue sending aid to the Afghan resistance as long as the Soviets continue arming the Afghan government.    But despite such flaws, U.S. officials view the agreement as a significant accomplishment. It achieves the Reagan administration's principal goal -- the quick and complete withdrawal of Soviet troops -- so that the issue of a continuing Soviet occupation won't cloud President Reagan's visit to Moscow.    The president would have found it politically awkward to arrive in Moscow while 115,000 Soviet troops remained encamped in Afghanistan without a firm plan to leave. But now, because the accord calls for Soviet troops to begin leaving May 15, Mr. Reagan will be able to attend the summit at the end of May claiming that the U.S. succeeded in coaxing the Soviets into a withdrawal.    Mr. Reagan, speaking to reporters at the White House, hailed the agreement as &quot;historic&quot; and a &quot;triumph.&quot; He also announced that he is dispatching Secretary Shultz to Geneva to sign the agreement Thursday, making the U.S. a &quot;guarantor&quot; of the accord. The agreement also will be signed by the Soviets, the Afghan government and Pakistan, which has supported Afghan rebel fighters and harbored thousands of Afghan refugees fleeing from Afghanistan's eight-year-old civil war.    Mr. Shultz, at a White House news conference, said the agreement calls for the Soviets to pull out 50% of their forces within three months of the beginning of withdrawal. The U.S. and Pakistan long had sought such a &quot;front-loading&quot; of the agreement to ensure that the Soviets don't reap the political benefits of beginning a withdrawal, and then drag their feet in carrying it out.    The agreement says the withdrawal must be completed by next February. But Mr. Shultz said Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze told the U.S. that the Soviets expect to complete the pullout before year end, and Mr. Shultz pledged that the U.S. will &quot;push for that.&quot;    But while the agreement seems to ensure an end to the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, it is far less certain whether the civil war will end or whether the U.S. will be able to continue helping the Afghan resistance if fighting continues. The U.S. now will have serious problems getting aid to the rebels.    The U.S. has been funneling aid to the rebels through Pakistan. But as part of the Soviet withdrawal agreement, Pakistan will sign a pact with Afghanistan pledging to avoid &quot;intervention&quot; in Afghan affairs -- an undertaking that appears to force Pakistan to stop serving as the conduit for arms shipments to the rebels.    So, while the U.S. reserves the right to continue sending arms, it hasn't any clear-cut way of getting the aid to the rebels without asking Pakistan to violate terms of the agreement.    Mr. Shultz wouldn't explain how the U.S. intends to get around the resupply problem. But he said, &quot;We are confident that we will be able to deliver that support, and we'll do so.&quot; U.S. decisions on aid levels will be affected by the &quot;pattern&quot; of Soviet aid to Kabul, Mr. Shultz said. </TEXT></DOC>
