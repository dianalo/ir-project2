By 1980, it looked as if the organization itself needed help.    CARE Inc., the American arm of the international aid organization, was reeling from a financial crisis that had forced cutbacks in some programs. Employee morale was low. Then, to cap it off, scandal struck: A senior CARE official was convicted of embezzling funds.    The troubles convinced CARE's directors of something they had long suspected: With annual revenue then at $200 million (now at $400 million) and projects in 37 countries, CARE had grown too big for its management systems. &quot;CARE . . . was running on love, compassion and doing the right thing,&quot; says Philip Johnston, executive director, who joined CARE in 1963.    The solution: new management, new computers, a new head office, some new professional staff and the development of financial systems like those used by forprofit companies. After five years of top-to-bottom management shake-ups, &quot;it's unquestionably a stronger and better organization,&quot; says Edwin J. Wesley, a lawyer who in 1980 was chairman of CARE and now is president, both volunteer positions.    While not all nonprofit organizations face the sort of crisis CARE did, many these days are making the same kinds of changes. Facing increased competition for funds, stricter demands from givers and government, and the need for more sophisticated planning, they are borrowing marketing, financial-planning, direct-mail and public-relations techniques from their for-profit brethren.    &quot;Nonprofits have had to become much more professional and exact about managing their resources, and much more sophisticated and aggressive about developing new resources,&quot; says Michael O'Neill, director of the Institute for Nonprofit Organization Management at the University of San Francisco. &quot;It's more than just bake sales.&quot;    CARE was born after World War II as Americans banded together to find ways to send packages of food and clothing to Europe. It was originally very personal, with people designating specific friends and relatives to receive aid.    But CARE gradually expanded, through government grants and private and corporate donations. It started school-lunch and maternal-health programs, and did disaster relief. It pushed into forestation programs, agribusiness development and job training as its focus broadened to include the underdeveloped countries of Asia, Latin America and Africa. The phrase behind the acronym -- originally Cooperative for American Remittances to Europe -- was changed to Cooperative for American Relief Everywhere.    CARE's management and management systems grew as the organization did, without changing fundamentally. But in 1979, donations from corporations, foundations and individuals fell about $5 million short of the projected $24 million. The shortfall caused a crisis. It also drove CARE's directors to conclude that they needed new people and methods.    Mr. Johnston, who was promoted in 1980 from director of CARE Europe to executive director of the U.S. organization, was encouraged by the board to hire outside managers. They found their work cut out for them. &quot;There were management problems throughout,&quot; says John McBride, who was vice president of finance and administration at Barnard College before becoming CARE's deputy executive director. &quot;There were horrible facilities, the wrong people in the wrong jobs, a computer that didn't do any good, no cohesive salary structure, no employment manual and no salary grades.&quot;    Some financial changes yielded quick results. About $1.7 million was moved from a checking account into interest-bearing accounts. Short-term investments were swapped for long-term ones. Such moves increased interest income to over $1 million a year in the past three years from an annual range of $200,000 to $500,000 in the several years before the changes.    CARE hired a professional receiving service to process donations on the same day they arrive; before that change, donations sent for Christmas 1980 weren't all opened until the following April.    CARE bought a new computer system. J. Hampson Skinker, who became CARE's budget director this year after taking early retirement from Westinghouse Electric Corp., says CARE's current computerized accounting system is as good as Westinghouse's.    Although CARE was doing larger and more complex projects, the systems to evaluate them hadn't become more sophisticated. Beryl Levinger, an assistant executive director who joined CARE in 1984, says a water system was funded in the Sudan three or four years ago, without any program for maintaining it. A program to give food aid to mothers and children in Guatemala, Haiti and the Philippines didn't monitor weight gains.    In the past two years, CARE has tried to plan projects in relation to each other, rather than separately, to get better feedback from the field, and to give projects better technical help. For example, the water project in the Sudan now includes a program for maintaining the system and training people in managing it, and a health-education program.    CARE increased management salaries 35% to 75% -- partly to draw more technically trained people. The salaries, which now range from $35,000 to $65,000, aren't lavish, but officials say they are competitive with smaller companies and other nonprofit institutions.    The hardest part was letting people go. &quot;It was a wrenching blow to the ethos of CARE,&quot; says Mr. Johnston. Some people were asked to take early retirement; others quit of their own accord. By the start of this year, about half of the staff from 1980 had left the organization.    Before the changes, &quot;we were more like lovers than workers,&quot; says Franklin Irving, who retired from CARE in 1977 after 30 years with the organization.    Today, Mr. Johnston concedes, &quot;the corporate culture still professes it's a family, but the glue that holds the family together isn't as thick as before.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
