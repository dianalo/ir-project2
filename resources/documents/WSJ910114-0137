Many advocates of term limitations are working to achievetheir goal by amending state laws because changing the U.S.Constitution is far more difficult and time-consuming. It'sunclear if their strategy will work in the long run, though;legal experts say it is unconstitutional for the states tolimit terms of federal legislators.</LP><TEXT>   But the harder issue, legal analysts say, is when and howthe state-imposed restrictions may be challenged in federalcourt. That could take years to resolve, and sow considerablelegal and political uncertainty in the meantime.   Although several states recently passed limits on thetenure of state officeholders, so far only Colorado hasimposed restrictions on membership in the U.S. Senate andHouse. By a majority of 71%, Colorado voters decided inNovember to place a 12-year cap on service in Congress. Thelimit isn't retroactive.   People who support the state legislative approach predictthat voters in some 20 states will consider term limits thisyear and next. Many of the proposals will apply to Congress.Interest in this approach in other states is spreading like&quot;wildfire,&quot; said the sponsor of the Colorado law, Republicanstate Sen. Terry Considine, at a conference last month.   Backers of state-by-state limits argue that theConstitution gives them the authority in Article I, Section4. It says, &quot;The times, places and manner of holdingelections for senators and representatives shall beprescribed in each state. . . .&quot;   But a number of constitutional experts say this viewoverlooks other provisions of the Constitution. In Article I,Sections 2 and 3, the Constitution establishes age,citizenship and residency qualifications for service in theHouse and Senate. Limiting the length of service would add anew qualification for office, they say, not merely change themanner of election. But, they argue, the qualifications foroffice can't be changed without a constitutional amendment.They cite constitutional interpretations as far back as theFederalist Papers, in which Alexander Hamilton wrote that thequalifications are &quot;defined and fixed in the Constitution andare unalterable by the legislature.&quot;   &quot;It is abundantly clear,&quot; says Harvard Law SchoolProfessor Laurence Tribe, &quot;that qualifications for federaloffice are matters of federal law as specified in theConstitution . . . and it is quite doubtful that a state canadd to the requirements for federal office.&quot;   His view is shared by legal experts at the Library ofCongress's Congressional Research Service, who concluded in amemo last summer that state legislation to limit terms offederal officeholders &quot;lacks support from the text of theConstitution, congressional practice and judicial precedent.&quot;   But who may challenge the Colorado law? Supreme Courtprecedents make clear that in order to file lawsuits infederal court, people must establish that they have sufferedor will imminently suffer some harm from the law they arechallenging. In the case of the Colorado law, is the harm tovoters, or to federal legislators? And has the harm occurredyet, since no legislator who is affected by the law will beprevented from running until the year 2002, 12 years fromnow?   These problems are being explored in detail by theAmerican Civil Liberties Union of Colorado, which plans tochallenge the state's law in the next several months,according to David Miller, legal director.   Mr. Miller says he hopes to file the lawsuit on behalf ofa political party, a voter and a candidate, to make sure thatall interests that could be affected by the law arerepresented. He says he is &quot;convinced&quot; that the proceduralhurdles to the lawsuit &quot;aren't a problem.&quot;   Steven Ross, legal counsel to the U.S. House, also saysthe obstacles to a lawsuit can be overcome. &quot;I think anargument can be made that the injury begins for the membersof Congress and their constituents right from the start, not12 years later,&quot; he says.   Prof. Tribe adds that without a court ruling, there may bea &quot;pernicious effect.&quot; The idea, he says, &quot;might spread likea constitutional disease on the false expectation that itwill be upheld by the courts.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
