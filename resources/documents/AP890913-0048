Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., saidTuesday after the decision by the Senate Appropriations subcommitteeon defense. ``You can't procure with the shape that missile is in.''   Without dissent, the subcommittee approved a $288.2 billionmilitary spending bill that eliminates Bush's request of $1.6billion for missile purchases in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1and $216 million for purchases further down the road.   Instead, the subcommittee approved $286 million for research anddevelopment of the missile, a more lethal version of the Trident 1,which is the heart of the Navy's nuclear deterrent. Bush had askedfor $216 million.   ``It's time to regroup,'' said Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska,ranking Republican on the subcommittee. ``It's a matter of caution.The money's there to use it to get more stability in the test.''   The action comes almost one month after a Trident 2 missileexploded seconds after being launched from the nuclear submarineTennessee about 200 miles off the coast of Florida.   At $26.5 million each, the Trident is supposed to be deployed inthe 1990s aboard a new generation of submarines, bolstering thesea-based leg of America's land, sea and air nuclear forces.   Defense Department spokesman Pete Williams, asked at a Pentagonbriefing whether the Navy would meet its operating date for theTrident 2, said the service will ``continue to try to find out thecause of the recent failure of the missile.''   ``There has been no decision to slip the initial operatingcapability date of March 1990,'' said Williams.   The House, in approving its versions of authorization andappropriations bills, and the Senate, which adopted itsauthorization legislation, did not alter Bush's budget request forthe missile. But the two chambers took those steps before the recentfailure of the Trident 2.   House and Senate conferees will begin meeting this week to hammerout an authorization bill. The Senate Appropriations Committee isexpected to vote Thursday on the military spending bill with fullSenate action likely next week.   In other action, the subcommittee left most of Bush's strategicprograms such as the B-2 stealth bomber and the MX and Midgetmannuclear missiles relatively intact, as the full Senate did lastmonth with the authorization bill.   The panel also approved $255 million for the Marine Corps to testthe V-22 Osprey, a vertical-takeoff plane, and accepted thepresident's decision to kill the Navy's F-14D jet fighter.   In addition, the subcommittee included $1.05 billion to helpfinance the war on drugs, including $300 million in cash andequipment for the Coast Guard, $62 million to operate surveillanceplanes and ships and $118 million for existing Defense Departmenteducation and drug-treatment programs.   Bush had asked for spending of $132 million in the legislation.   The panel went slightly beyond the full Senate in trimming fundsfor the Star Wars missile shield. The Senate authorization bill putthe Strategic Defense Initiative amount at $4.5 billion, a cut of$400 million from Bush's budget. The subcommittee cut SD researchand development to $3.7 billion, which, when added to the $355million in Energy Department money and military construction funds,is a total of about $4.1 billion.   In addition to the spending bill of $279.7 billion, thesubcommittee adopted a separate $8.5 billion amendment that includes$1 billion for four cargo ships and two tankers, $1.3 billion toreplace nuclear power reactors on the carrier Enterprise, $1.7billion for 174 Apache helicopters and $3.4 billion for modernizingmajor military components such as ship radar systems.   The House last month approved a $286.5 billion militaryappropriations bill that slashed nearly $2 billion for Star Warsfrom Bush's request, strictly limited the B-2 bomber program andmade drastic cuts in the MX and Midgetman missiles.   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, in a recent letter to the chairmenof the House and Senate Armed Services Committees, said he wouldrecommend that Bush veto any defense bill that resembles the Houselegislation.</TEXT></DOC>
