SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, promising a``more aggressive'' Pentagon role in the international drug battle,is giving regional military leaders a month to come up with detailsto carry it out.   ``I think the relative level of effort _ compared to what hasbeen done in the past _ will be significantly greater,'' Cheneypledged when he announced his project at a Pentagon briefing onMonday.   In an attempt to fulfill the Pentagon role as the nation's leadagency in the drug interdiction effort, Cheney acknowledges that theagency may ``have to make some tradeoffs'' because of ever-shrinkingbudgets.   But he said the new attentiveness toward illicit narcotics as anational security threat should not ``in any way conflict with ourbasic mission of defending the country.''   Cheney said he had told the heads of the various major militarycommands to draw up plans by Oct. 15 to use planes, ships, radar andtroops to help stem the flow of drugs into the United States.   The secretary said he could not estimate the cost of the effort,nor the number of servicemen and women needed, until the commandersreport back to him.   Cheney said the Defense Department will emphasize stopping drugsfrom entering the country, but also will help fight drug abuse andaid other nations in attacking drugs at their source.   ``I hope that our interdiction efforts will be more successful inthe future in part because we've got more aggressive efforts nowunderway in the host countries and a greater willingness for them tocooperate in our efforts,'' Cheney said.   He said the Pentagon planned ``a more aggressive and robustposture'' to help President Bush implement his anti-drug fight inthe Andean nations, as well.   Until now, the Pentagon's role has been to support the efforts ofstate National Guard units, which have been used for such duties asinspecting cargo at ports of entry, taking part in aerial searchesfor marijuana crops and helping transport law enforcement officialsor contraband. Those efforts have varied from state to state.   Cheney insisted that in no case would the Pentagon be drawn intoa law enforcement role.   Nor, he said, will U.S. forces overseas be sent into combat.``There's a clear line out there,'' Cheney said, that the militarywill not cross.   ``It's a dangerous business. I hope nobody's hurt in the process,but I can't guarantee it,'' Cheney said, adding that U.S. personnelare acting under rules of engagement that allow them to defendthemselves.   Asked whether he backed shooting down planes that refuse toidentify themselves and are suspected of smuggling drugs, as some inCongress have suggested, Cheney said the department has no suchauthority and does not intend to ask for it.   Cheney said the department intends to deploy ``appropriateelements of the Armed Forces'' to help reduce the flow of drugs intothe country, but cited no specific numbers or types of militarypersonnel.   Among other things, the secretary said, he has asked thecommanders to:   _Plan for a ``substantial Caribbean counter-narcotics task force,with appropriate planes and ships,'' to cut the drug flow from LatinAmerica.   _Study the use of military forces to support the counter-drugwork of U.S. law enforcement agencies, such as the Drug EnforcementAdministration, and ``cooperating foreign governments,'' inparticular Mexico.   _Examine for the use of high-tech facilities available at NORAD(North American Aerospace Defense Command) to help detect illegaldrug traffic coming across the nation's borders.   _Find ways of combating the production and trafficking of illegaldrugs in conjunction with unnamed ``cooperating host countries.''</TEXT></DOC>
