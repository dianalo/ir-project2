SullivanandM;Market barometers indicating that the Unix market is poised for explosivegrowth were corroborated recently by results from a survey of Dexpo West 88attendees, 57 percent of whom said they use or plan to evaluate the Unixoperating system.andM;The results of the survey were based on the responses of 473 attendees of theAnaheim, Calif., conference, which was geared to users of Digital EquipmentCorp. (DEC) systems.andM;More than 35 percent of these users currently run the Unix operating system,the survey found, and 34 percent of those not using the multitaskingoperating system said they plan to evaluate Unix for future use.andM;Users running Unix said they do so on hardware platforms such as workstations(60 percent), minicomputers (46 percent), multiuser microcomputers (28percent) and PCs (23 percent).andM;Market research from CAP International Inc., of Norwell, Mass., confirms theDexpo findings that the Unix market is surging.andP;  Preliminary figures put the1988 Unix market in the United States at $6.7 billion, a figure expected tomore than double to $14.7 billion by 1991.andM;User demands for computer systems with an open architecture, such as Unix,instead of proprietary environments, such as DEC's VMS, give firms such asDEC the incentive to strengthen support for Unix, according to marketresearchers.andM;Incentive for DevelopersandM;''It's not just that DEC wants to have an architecture that's open, as muchas users demanding Unix [that is fueling the market],'' said Paul Nelson,communications and networking consultant for Venture Development Corp., inNatick, Mass.andM;CAP International estimates that DEC controls 20 percent of the Unix market,even though only 25 percent of VAX workstations currently run Ultrix, DEC'sversion of Unix.andM;DEC's workstation announcements last week show continued support for both VMSand Ultrix by supporting full data interchange between the two environments,said Ajit Kapoor, senior vice president for electronic imaging systems at CAPInternational.andP;  (See related story, Page 1.)andM;DEC is allowing users to ''build on what they have'' with VMS and Ultrix.andO;''If you want Unix, you got it.andP;  If you want VMS, you got it.andP;  If you want totalk to both, you've got that too,'' he said.andM;Many users are replacing proprietary systems with Unix as well as adding Unixto what they already have, according to market-research figures.andP;  Evaluationsare under way at Westinghouse Electric Corp., in Pittsburgh, for example, todetermine if a change to Unix on the firm's supercomputer would bebeneficial.andM;The anticipated switch to Unix at Westinghouse means ''there's a lot ofincentive to go over on the PC as well,'' said Brian Alsop, fellow engineerat Westinghouse.andP;  ''The ideal Unix system is something that does both DOS andUnix well.''andM;While some firms have already made Unix part of their strategic direction,others are waiting for more applications solutions to become available.andM;''If I hear of applications-software vendors developing for Unix, then Iwould be more interested in Unix,'' said Julian Horwich, executive directorof the Chicago Association for Microcomputer Professionals (CAMP) and sectionmanager of office technology at a Fortune 100 company.andP;  Horwich maintainsthat today's DOS environment offers the applications solutions that officeusers need.andM;DEC is not the only minicomputer vendor responding quickly to increasing userinterest in the Unix operating environment.andM;In recognition of Unix's possibilities in the marketplace, Data GeneralCorp., of Westboro, Mass., plans to ship its first industry-standardUnix-based computer, the Dasher/386, in early February.andP;  Data Generalcurrently supports only DG/UX, its proprietary Unix operating system.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
