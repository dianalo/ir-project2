The withdrawals topped the one-month record of $7.0 billion setin November, bringing the net outflow for two months to $15.1billion, said the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which regulates2,955 federally insured savings institutions.   Meanwhile, in a separate development, the Federal DepositInsurance Corp. said Friday it had taken control of six more savingsinstitutions, bringing to 10 the number of Sandamp;Ls brought under theagency's control since President Bush on Monday gave it thatresponsibility under his plan for the Sandamp;L crisis.   The December outflow, the eighth consecutive, was happening at atime of mounting publicity about Sandamp;L problems. Regulators closed ormerged 75 institutions that month.   But, Bert Ely, a financial institutions analyst in Alexandria,Va., said money was moving out of Sandamp;Ls because their interest ratesare moving up more slowing than other investments, not becausedepositors were nervous.   ``I don't think people are losing confidence. ... What this issignaling is we have an industry ... that is under real pressurebecause of these rising rates,'' he said.   Ely noted some accelaration in the increase of interest paid toSandamp;L depositors and said rates would likely be forced higher as theFederal Reserve Board tightens credit in an effort to dampeninflation.   ``They have to start matching the rising rates and, boy, that'shard on the bottom line. This does not bode well for thriftearnings,'' he said. The industry, on the way to a record year ofred ink, lost $9.4 billion in the first nine months of 1988.   According to minutes released Friday of a Dec. 13-14 meeting ofFederal Reserve policymakers, the central bank decided to push upinterest rates. The lone dissenter was Federal Reserve Board memberMartha Seger, who ``expressed particular concern that the higherinterest rates ... would aggravate'' the troubled condition of theSandamp;L industry, the minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee said.   Economist Martin Regalia of the National Council of SavingsInstitutions said the president's effort this week appears to havebolstered confidence in savings institutions.   ``If you look at the stock market, they look at this wholeprocess as being a net plus. Thrift stocks have risen in the lastfew days because I guess they feel the problem is being addressed,''he said.   James Barth, chief economist of the bank board, said a singleinstitution shrank its deposit base by $3.4 billion, on purpose,substituting low-cost borrowing.   He also noted that money normally flows out of savings accountsin December as people spend to celebrate the holidays.   For all of 1988, $8.4 billion flowed out of Sandamp;Ls, compared with$1.8 billion in 1987. The annual record of $25.4 billion was set in1981, when interest rates soared and money flowed into money marketmutual funds and other alternatives to savings accounts.   The six institutions taken over by the FDIC, under a cooperationagreement with Sandamp;L regulators, are: First Federal of Arkansas,Little Rock, Ark.; Savers Federal Savings and Loan Association,Little Rock, Ark; Sandia Federal Savings and Loan Association,Albuquerque, N.M.; Bright Banc, Dallas; University SavingsAssociation, Houston, and Deseret Federal Savings and LoanAssociation, Salt Lake City.   FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman said his agency, which insurescommercial bank deposits, will take control of more than 200insolvent Sandamp;Ls in the next four to six weeks.   In an interview Friday, he confirmed published reports that topadministration officials were worried that a faster takeover couldtrigger a depositor run. He said the Federal Reserve Board puttogether a plan to pump money into the Sandamp;L system in the event of aproblem.   ``There were people inside the government who were veryconcerned,'' Seidman said. `` ... I was on the other side, but I wasjust as eager to have a (contingency) plan just in case.''   He said he believed the danger to the Sandamp;L system had eased nowthat Bush had submitted his Sandamp;L proposal to Congress.</TEXT></DOC>
