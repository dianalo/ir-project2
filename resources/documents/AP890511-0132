Lt. Gen. Abdul Haq Olumy told a news conference the plan was toattack the eastern city of Jalalabad and Kandahar in the south onSunday.   The general is secretary of the National Defense Council and aranking member of the Communist Party Central Committee.   President Najib, who uses only one name, has repeatedly accusedPakistan of armed intervention, which the Pakistanis deny.   Pakistan serves as a base for the guerrillas, who began fightingafter a communist coup in April 1978, and the insurgents get mostof their support from the United States, China and Saudi Arabia.   Olumy said 7,000 Pakistani soldiers and militiamen disguised asguerrillas had been moved to the border or inside Afghanistan forthe new assault on Jalalabad and a smaller force was beingmobilized near Quetter to attack Kandahar.   Jalalabad, the Nangarhar provincial capital 75 miles east ofKabul, has been under siege since March 7. The insurgents made ittheir first major target after the Soviet military withdrawal wascompleted Feb. 15, and they initially predicted it would fallwithin days.   Military officials say the city has been hit by more than131,000 shells and rockets, more than 500 civilians have beenkilled and at least 3,000 wounded.   Earlier this week, the army launched a counterattack and claimedthe guerrillas had been pushed back as much as 25 miles on twofronts.   Kandahar, capital of Kandahar province, has been under sporadicattack for a year.</TEXT></DOC>
