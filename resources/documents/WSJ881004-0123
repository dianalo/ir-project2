The official Saudi announcement didn't surprise traders, who have been watching the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries continue to glut the market with oil in recent weeks. However, the willingness of the Saudis to so openly flout their quota indicated their willingness to expose the market to severe risk -- all in hopes of restoring discipline to the cartel.    &quot;It's a rehash of two years ago,&quot; when Saudi Arabia unleashed millions of barrels of oil into the market to discipline quota-offenders, said Peter Gignoux, manager of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s international energy department in London. &quot;Petromin (the national oil company of Saudi Arabia) is now in the market to do business,&quot; he said, &quot;and it's going to do whatever it takes to sell its oil.&quot;    Crude oil prices plummeted in late trading yesterday, partly in response to the Saudi announcement. At the New York Mercantile Exchange, oil for delivery in November fell 31 cents a barrel to settle at $13.06. Prices had already tumbled 55 cents a barrel Friday when OPEC Secretary General Subroto said that oil prices could skid to $5 a barrel if Saudi Arabia and other quota offenders don't rein in production.    A number of large oil companies in the U.S. and Canada -- Marathon Oil, Phillips Petroleum, Shell Canada, Petro-Canada, Imperial Oil -- cut their posted, or buying, price for crude oil yesterday, generally by $1 a barrel to $13 a barrel, in the case of West Texas intermediate crude. In addition, Pemex, the national oil company of Mexico, lowered the export prices it charges for certain grades of crude oil.    Yesterday's statement by the Saudis followed several days of reports that the kingdom was loosing huge supplies of oil into the burdened world marketplace. The statement declared that the giant Mideast producer won't &quot;freeze&quot; output at its OPEC quota of 4.3 million barrels a day, or act as a so-called swing producer, so long as other OPEC members violate assigned quotas. The kingdom called on the offenders to return to their quotas.    Indeed, industry sources say that Saudi Arabia is pushing between 200,000 and 400,000 barrels a day of extra crude into the market. And this doesn't take into account crude oil already in storage at terminals in the Caribbean, from which the Saudis supply four U.S. customers and from which they will draw oil to supply its newly established joint-venture refining arrangement with Texaco Inc. One individual familiar with the situation said that storage facilities at Bonaire, where the Saudis are known to store crude oil, are full.    In another unusual move, the Saudis have been selling some crude oil on a spot, or non-contract, basis. And Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, an industry newsletter that has been closely monitoring Saudi sales, reported that the Mitsubishi group of Japan has been offered a discount of 25 cents a barrel for every barrel they buy beyond its contractual allotment of 100,000 barrels and 30 cents a barrel for volumes over 150,000 barrels.    Although major oil companies have professed little concern over the short-term slide in oil prices, the industry is starting to get a little &quot;nervous&quot; about the severity of the current decline, said Martin Pranga, director of foreign affairs for Amoco Corp., Chicago. Should prices remain at current low levels, the forecasts on which companies have based their exploration and production plans will have to be recast. &quot;But we're not ready to panic yet,&quot; he insisted.    Just the same, traders said that two failed rallies in the futures market suggest that prices may fall further. &quot;Prices may test $13&quot; today, said John Hill, an analyst for Merrill Lynch.    In the futures market, most of the volume was stirred by traders rather than major oil companies or world oil producers, who generally remained on the sidelines. In the spot market, at least a dozen cargoes of Brent, a widely traded North Sea crude, changed hands. But, traders said, a large Japanese trading company holding a &quot;mega-position&quot; involving as many as 40 cargoes of Brent crude is making the market jittery because tumbling prices could upset the long chain of trading transactions. </TEXT></DOC>
