And in fact, they said, thereis an occasional air pollution problem in the Monterey Bay area asmeasurements of ozone, one of the most dangerous components of smog, exceedthe state standard of 0.09 parts per million.;    Those readings occur about&quot;a half-dozen times a year&quot; in the Hollister area and Carmel Valley, saidJanet Brennan, a planner for the Monterey Bay Unified Air Pollution ControlDistrict.;    The state has identified a &quot;moderate&quot; ozone problem in thisregion, called the North Coast Air Basin, according to Greg Koert, a plannerfor the Association of Monterey Bay Area Governments.;    In order to meet thestate air-quality guidelines, Koert told supervisors, a mix of severalpollution-reducing methods is being considered for the Monterey Bay area.;   Paying for parking;    Some, he admitted, were going to be tough on people --and one that drew fire in a previous presentation to the Scotts Valley citycouncil may be shelved, at least temporarily. That plan, to require stores andshopping centers to charge drivers for using their parking lots, needs to beestablished as a statewide program in order to be equitable, Koert said.;   He told supervisors that charging shoppers for parking has proved to be &quot;veryeffective to encourage car-pooling and use of transit&quot; in other states. But,he agreed, some people would drive out of town to shop in nearby areas thatdidn't adopt the pay-for-parking requirement.;    Other proposals mentioned byKoert included:;    (check) Forcing firms employing 100 or more workers toreduce trips to and from the company -- by requiring car-pooling, for instance-- by 40 percent by the end of 1994. This plan, if adopted for the MontereyBay air pollution district, would go into effect next January, and a similarrule for firms employing 50 or more workers would be mandated as of January1993.;    (check) Creating transportation management associations. Thesegroupings of several businesses, such as stores in a downtown area, would haveto meet similar &quot;trip-reduction&quot; goals as major employers.;    (check)Requiring high schools, community colleges and universities to meet similargoals as businesses.;    Supervisor Jan Beautz was skeptical of that lastproposal, noting that if schools such as Soquel High in her supervisorialdistrict reduce parking facilities students will merely leave their cars inadjacent neighborhoods.;    Supervisor Fred Keeley noted several times duringthe discussion that not only are the air-quality standards mandated fromSacramento but that county supervisors will not be making the decisions onways to meet the guidelines. Rather, he stressed, decisions about which stepsto take to meet the tough standards will be taken by the tri-county AirPollution Control District on a regionwide basis. The district includes SantaCruz, Monterey and San Benito counties.;    Brennan, a planner for thedistrict, also pointed out that &quot;there is no deadline&quot; to meet the standards,although steps to reduce ozone in the atmosphere must get under way soonunless even stricter policies are mandated by the state.;    &quot;We aredesignated as having 'moderate' ozone pollution,&quot; she said. &quot;That means wethink we can achieve the state standards by 1994. If we think it might takelonger, we could be designated as having a 'serious' problem, and therequirements could become more onerous.;    &quot;We want to achieve thesestandards as soon as possible.&quot;;    Comments from the meeting will beforwarded to the air pollution control district, Keeley said.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  LEE QUARNSTROM, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Santa Cruz/Monterey  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910130  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  726  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday January 30, 199100030147,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
