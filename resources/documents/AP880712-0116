Richard L. Thornburgh, tosucceed Edwin Meese III as attorney general.   Thornburgh, a squeaky clean ex-prosecutor with a reputation forstaying cool under fire, declined comment on the troubles of Meese,who has been dogged by questions about his ethics and who announcedlast week that he had been exonerated by a special prosecutor andwould leave office Aug. 1.   Thornburgh said, ``I think it is important to look forwardrather than back. I think what we will try to do is to carry out afull-bore effort in the law enforcement area.''   Asked if he would have to look into investigations of Meese,Thornburgh at first declined to answer, then added, ``My intentionin this as in any areas is to follow the evidence wherever it maylead.''   Meese could still face an internal department review of hisactions.   Reagan, who appeared with Thornburgh in the White House briefingroom, called Thornburgh ``the ideal choice for attorney general.   ``I urge the Senate to move quickly to confirm him as well asour other Justice Department nominees so they can roll up theirsleeves and get to work enforcing the laws of the land.''   Also awaiting Senate confirmation are the deputy attorneygeneral, Harold Christensen; the No. 3 person in the department,Associate Attorney General Francis Keating, and the criminaldivision chief, Edward Dennis.   Christensen and Dennis have been on the job since early June;Keating has been at work about a month longer. All were appointedon an acting basis by Reagan.   There appeared to little opposition in the Senate to thenomination.   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, the No. 2 Demcorat onthe Senate Judiciary Committee, which will review Thornburgh'snomination, said he expected a rapid confirmation.   ``I have the greatest respect for Dick Thornburgh,'' Kennedysaid. ``The state of justice in America would be very differenttoday if Dick Thornburgh had been attorney general for the past 3{years instead of Ed Meese.''   Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, the panel's rankingRepublican, priaded Thornburgh's ``deep intellect and unmatchedintegrity.''   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole proclaimed Thornburgh ``atough man for a tough job'' and said the selection ``deservesspeedy Senate confirmation,''   Reagan told reporters that Thornburgh ``was a prosecutor'sprosecutor for six years as a United States attorney for WesternPennsylvania, a tough-minded crime buster winning an unprecedentednumber of convictions for corruption and against members oforganized crime.''   Reagan said that, as governor for eight years, Thornburgh ``wontough mandatory jail terms for violent and repeat criminals. He wasin the forefront of the war against drugs, cracking down on drugtraffickers and creating preventive eduction programs forPennsylvania school children.''   News of the nomination cheered officials with Vice PresidentGeorge Bush's presidential campaign, who had worried aloud aboutpolitical damage to the certain Republican nominee from thepersistent questions over Meese's ethics.   Thornburgh, 55, earned a reputation for methodical, steadyleadership in 1979 when, after only 72 days as governor, he wasfaced with the nation's worst commercial nuclear accident, at ThreeMile Island near Harrisburg.   Six years later, he said he learned several lessons from theaccident. They included: forget partisanship during crises, don'tbe afraid to ``scramble the organization chart,'' and ``respect butdo not depend on the news media.''   But it is Thornburgh's ability as a prosecutor that set himapart from other attorney general candidates, according to severalof his former aides. As U.S. attorney for western Pennsylvania,Thornburgh's attacks on organized cime, public corruption and drugtrafficking led to his 1975 appointment by President Ford asassistant attorney general in charge of the Justice Department'scriminal division.   At the Justice Department, Thornburgh credits himself in abiography with ``enhancing the effort to combat organized crime andpublic corruption nationwide.'' As a prosecutor, his targetsincluded a U.S. customs agent, a county sheriff and a former GOPcongressman, J. Irving Whalley, who was convicted in a kickbackcase.   Thornburgh's calm handling of the TMI nuclear plant accident wasrecalled Monday by Sen. Alan K. Simpson, R-Wyo., a member of theSenate Judiciary Committee.   ``I saw him handle that with maturity and skill. He dealthonestly with the issue, without emotion or hysteria. He has a finegrasp of government,'' Simpson said.   Barred by law from seeking a third term as governor, Thornburghleft Pennsylvania at the end of 1986 to head the Institute ofPolitics at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government.   In the last several days, Republican Sens. John Heinz and ArlenSpecter of Pennsylvania and others familiar with Thornburgh havebeen questioned about him by White House officials. A formerThornburgh aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, told of beingasked about Thornburgh's views on abortion and replying that thoseviews were not incompatible with the administration's.   Thornburgh vetoed an anti-abortion bill in 1981, saying it wasexcessively restrictive, but later signed a weakened version of themeasure.   As governor, Thornburgh frequently testified on Capitol Hill onbehalf of the president's proposal for line-item veto power and aconstitutional amendment to balance the budget.   He turned down earlier offers from the Reagan White House tohead the FBI and Agency for International Development. Thornburghhad also been mentioned as a possible running mate for Bush.   Meese has been under fire since his arrival in Washington over asuccession of ethical questions. He announced his decision to leavethe Justice Department on the same day last week that independentcounsel James McKay wound up a 14-month criminal investigation ofthe attorney general.   McKay declined to prosecute, but portions of his sealed reporton the investigation reportedly question Meese's candor and ethics.</TEXT></DOC>
