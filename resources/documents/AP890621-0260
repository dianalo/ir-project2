(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A group of semiconductor companiestoday announced the formation of a manufacturing corporation thatexpects to raise more than $1 billion over several years to boostU.S. production of memory chips.   The plan, which sets up a corporation named U.S. Memories Inc.,calls for the venture to be funded by microchip makers and theirmajor customers.   Companies which contributed ``seed money'' to form thecorporation include Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Digital EquipmentCorp., Hewlett-Packard Co., International Business Machines Corp.,Intel Corp., LSI Logic Corp. and National Semiconductor.   ``The time is right for a collective memory manufacturing venturein the United States to improve America's market position in what istruly a critical technology,'' said Sanford L. Kane, president andchief executive officer of the newly formed corporation and a formervice president at IBM.   The venture is aimed at lessening the dependence on Japan forDRAMs, the dynamic random access memory chips that are important tocomputers, consumer electronics and advanced military hardware.   U.S. companies, which once led the DRAM business, account forabout 15 percent of the $12 billion North American market.   Another chip consortium, called Sematech, researches newmanufacturing technologies but cannot build commercial products. Itis funded with $100 million annually from the Defense Department andan equal amount from 14 U.S. chipmakers.   U.S. Memories is expected to begin by setting up a high-volumeplant to make a new generation of DRAM that can store 4 million bitsof information.   Japanese companies are just beginning to ship samples of thefour-megabit varieties that offer four times the storage of theone-megabit chips often found in personal computers.   The Semiconductor Industry Association has been organizing theconsortium.   ``Any consortium that brings together U.S. electronics companiesto further our global advantage is a step in the right direction,''said William Krause, chairman of the American ElectronicsAssociation. ``I find this to be a very positive step.''</TEXT></DOC>
