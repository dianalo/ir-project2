The Chicago-based unit of UAL Corp. called expansion toLatin America an &quot;essential part of United's internationalgrowth strategy.&quot; The carrier is already awaiting approval ofa June request to fly to Brazil from Los Angeles.</LP><TEXT>   United said approval of both the routes would make it a&quot;major competitive factor&quot; in the Latin American market.   Currently, only American Airlines and the troubled PanAmerican World Airways compete in Brazil. When Delta AirLines recently purchased most of Pan Am's operations, thesale left Pan Am with only its Latin American routes, whichhas drawn the interest of other major carriers.   United proposes to join its competitors by providing dailyservice between its new Orlando hub and Rio de Janeiro andSao Paulo.</TEXT></DOC>
