 The NEWS 3710 is a Unix system, based onthe MIPS R3000 Reduced Instruction Set Chip (RISC) and initially targeted atthe electronic design automation, CAD/CAE, CASE, and image processingmarkets.andP;  Sony has also positioned the NEWS 3710 as a file server forMacintosh networks.andM;The workstation was designed according to the &quot;center of gravity&quot; in themarketplace, which indicated that the majority of technical workstation usersneeded something lower-end than the NeXT machine.andP;  sony has positioned theNEWS 3710 as direct competition to Sun Microsystems's SPARCStation, but ispromising higher performance at a lower price.andP;  A basic model NEWS 3710 ispriced at $6,800, compared to $8,995 for a similarly configured SPARCStation.andM;Sony has built networking capability right into its workstation, making itunnecessary to waste expansion slots for LAN adapter cards.andP;  All NEWS 3710workstations include an Ethernet port (as well as a SCSI, parallel, audio,and two serial ports), and TCP/IP and XNS protocols.andP;  The workstations alsosupport Sun's NFS, making it easy to integrate them into a heterogeneousnetworking environment.andM;The workstation is available in a number of configurations.andP;  The barebonesmodel is a 17 MIPS system with a single floppy drive, a black-and-white19-inch monitor, 8MB of memory, and three expansion slots.andP;  Otherconfigurations incorporate a hard disk in either 286MB or 640MB capacities,rewritable optical drives, 4mm tape drives, and 19-inch color Trinitronmonitors.andP;  Memory can be expanded in 4MB increments up to 32MB.andP;  Prices rangefrom $6,800 to $18,200, depending on the specific model.andM;All models come with NEWS-OS, Sony's version of Berkeley Unix with someSystem V extensions.andP;  The NEWS 3710 is also C-source code compatible with theComplete Instruction Set Computer (CICS) family of NEWS workstations.andP;  Thesystem offers the Open System Foundation's Motif graphical user interface anda set of X Window protocols.andP;  Both Motif and X windows have been selected bythe CAD Framework Initiative, a consortium of electronic design automationvendors.andM;Accoring to Toshi Doi, senior general manager of Sony Microsystems andco-inventor of the compact disc, the multimedia features that vendors arestarting to incorporate into their workstations signal a trend wherecomputers will be easier for humans to interact with.andP;  The main stickingpoint, says Doi, is the lack of standards for the different media.andM;The NEWS 3710 is a true, graphics-oriented, multimedia machine.andP;  An audioport for a microphone attachment provides sound quality approaching a CD.andO;The system comes with a sound editor, and both audio and graphics can beincorporated into text documents.andM;Recognizing an existing vacuum, Sony is also going after the Macintoshnetworking arena by positioning the workstation as a Macintosh file server.andO;With one processor functioning as a CPU and the other dedicated to I/Oprocessing, the NEWS 3710 is well-suited to handle the graphics-intensiveapplications that abound on Macintoshes.andP;  The server, though Unix-based, iscompletely transparent to the Macintosh nodes by virtue of its uShare Plussoftware.andM;The software can be loaded, configured, and administered directly from aMacintosh.andP;  The network manager can even reboot or shut down the server froma local node.andP;  uShare Plus is compliant with the Appletalk File Protocol,ensuring that all existing AppleShare applications will work withoutcompatibility problems.andP;  Unix users can also exchange files and data withMacintosh users over uShare.andP;  Users can create virtual drives on the server,so they can boot and run applications from their local node, without a harddisk or system floppy.andM;uShare includes management utilities called Wasy Administrator that allow thenetwork manager to add, modify, and delete users, groups, and volumes.andP;  Italso allows for network reports and user tracking on a daily and monthlybasis.andP;  Local Mac drives can be backed up to the server across the network.andO;uShare also provides network software licensing so applications can be placedin a shared volume and accessed by several users simultaneously.andP;  Finally,uShare also provides e-mail and print spooling.andM;Sony decided to focus initially on the Mac LAN market not only because of itsstrong graphical orientation and the lack of a similarly positioned productin the marketplace, but because the fact is its Motorola-based architecturemakes it incompatible with machines based on the Intel architecture.andP;  DespiteNEWS 3710's RISC roots, basic file layout compatibility problems must beovercome.andM;Sony is unique in the workstation market for several reasons, not the leastof which is its global scope.andP;  As James Mannos, vice president of engineeringat Sony points out, the company is a microcosm of the world, with itsinternational offices and heterogeneous global network.andP;  &quot;Before weintroduced our own workstations we bought them fromeveryone--Hewlett-Packard, Sun, Apollo, and DEC,&quot; says Mannos.andP;  &quot;We had tointegrate them into our own wide area network.andP;  We're our own test bed.&quot;andO;Sony also already manufactured all the necessary peripherals itself, frommonitors to optical disks to DAT drives.andM;Furthermore, Sony has an understanding of the international market.andP;  Europeanmodels of the NEWS 3710 will differ from the American version in size andavailable configurations.andP;  The NEWS 3710 also incorporates full support forKanji ideograms, making an ideal platform on which to develop software anduser interfaces for Japanese-language software.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
