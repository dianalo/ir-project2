Separately, Summit said in Watertown, Mass., that it expects revenue of $4 million to $4.5 million for 1989, up from $1.1 million a year earlier.    During the surgery, called photo-refractive keratectomy, the corneal mask is dissolved by a laser in a process that sculpts the cornea to correct vision, the company said. The masks are expected to be priced at about $200 each, the company added.    Summit is one of several companies developing specialized lasers for corneal sculpting. Summit said that although the procedure isn't yet approved by the Food and Drug Administration, the company is selling its lasers to ophthalmologists while clinical trials are under way. </TEXT></DOC>
