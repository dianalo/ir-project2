After a little more than two months of deliberations, the Presidential Task Force on Market Mechanisms, also known as the Brady commission, has rolled out its proposals. They range from giving the Federal Reserve a bigger regulatory role to introducing &quot;circuit breakers&quot; that can cool the pace of trading before a panic sets in.    Some market professionals are already arguing that the recommendations go too far; others, that they don't go far enough.    Here's a review of the five major recommendations by the presidential task force, in question-and-answer form.    Q: What is the central goal of the task force's recommendations?    A: To take a &quot;one-market&quot; approach toward stock, options and futures. As the task force sees it, a major problem in the October crash was that big sellers in the futures markets didn't realize how much their sales would depress stock prices. In a variety of ways, the task force wants to bring supervision of these markets closer together. That way, it hopes, any subsequent build-up of selling pressure can be better recognized before causing an explosion.    Q: What agency would be the new &quot;super-cop&quot; for the markets?    A: The presidential commission favors the Federal Reserve Board. It would oversee existing regulators, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Fed already sets stock margin levels, and has a stature and impartiality that other candidates can't quite match.    Q. Is the Fed interested?    A. Not really. At a news conference Friday, Nicholas Brady, chairman of the presidential task force, said that Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan &quot;made no commitments about the Fed taking on such a job.&quot;    Q. The Brady report also favors some sort of &quot;circuit breakers&quot; in the financial markets. How would these work?    A. The basic idea is to slow down trading when it gets frenzied. That way, people can pause, reassess prices, and perhaps see buying opportunities where panic might have prevailed otherwise. The October price break was so sudden that many &quot;value-oriented investors&quot; didn't have time to emerge as buyers, the Brady panel contends -- and a potential stabilizing force was lost.    The text of the Brady report alludes to &quot;price limits, position limits, volume limits and trading halts&quot; on securities. But it doesn't say exactly which of these it wants, or how they would be applied.    Q. What sort of circuit breakers currently exist?    A. The main ones are in the futures markets. Speculators aren't allowed to own more than 5,000 contracts each on the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock futures contract. That amounts to about $600 million at current prices. And since late October, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange has limited daily moves in the Sandamp;P futures to 30 points in either direction, about 12% currently. If those limits are reached, trading essentially stops for the day. But there aren't any such limits in the stock market itself.    Q. Are these existing circuit-breakers enough?    A. Experts differ. The Brady panel seems to suggest that something more is needed. But it ran into a firestorm of protests about the idea of price limits on stocks.    Q. What about margin requirements?    A. Here, the Brady commission would like to see stock and futures margin requirements &quot;unified.&quot; Currently, most investors can buy stocks on 50% margin, or down payment, yet can buy stock-index futures on just 8% to 12% margin. That increases leverage for gains in futures, but heightens risks for losses. Before the crash, futures margins were as low as 5%.    At his news conference, Mr. Brady said he didn't necessarily favor 50% futures margins. He hinted that lower margins might be acceptable, perhaps comparable to the 20% to 25% margin allowed in the stock market for certain securities firms' own trading.    Q. Would futures traders welcome higher margins?    A. No. They contend that commodity markets are regulated differently from stocks, and generally work well with lower margins. Some Chicago futures market professionals have complained that studies such as the Brady commission are just plain prejudiced against futures.    Q. What else does the Brady commission recommend?    A. Two things. It would like a unified clearing system to handle stock, futures and options trading. Currently, this function is divided among various New York and Chicago entities. And it would like fuller disclosure of the &quot;ultimate customer&quot; in securities trades. For most trades currently, brokerage firms only need to report that they are acting as agent for an unspecified client.    Q. What would these changes do?    A. Make it easier for regulators to sort out trading debacles after the fact. Perhaps help safeguard against the kind of credit crunch that threatened the markets the morning of Oct. 20. But both changes would be cumbersome to implement, and securities firms aren't likely to embrace them.    Q. What doesn't the Brady commission recommend?    A. It doesn't call for major changes in the New York Stock Exchange specialist system, though it acknowledges that specialists were under severe strain in the October market rout.    It doesn't call for bans or severe limits on computerized trading. The Brady report sees little to criticize in one such form of trading, index arbitrage. The report does blame another computerized strategy, portfolio insurance, for some of the October selling. But since the crash, that strategy has largely fallen out of favor, anyway. </TEXT></DOC>
