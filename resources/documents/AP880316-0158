AGUILAR</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Thousands of demonstrators pouredinto the streets of the capital today after rebellious soldiersfailed to seize the headquarters of the nation's militarystrongman, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.   It was the largest outpouring of opposition to themilitary-dominated government since civilian opponents began tryingto force Noriega's departure as head of the Panama Defense Forceslast summer.   Protesters erected flaming barricades across hundreds of streetsthroughout Panama City. In the capital's financial and touristdistrict, as well as the poorer sections of the downtown businesscenter, people chanted: ``Noriega must go. ... Noreiga, tyrant,your end is near.''   Starting at about 8:15 a.m., nearby residents heard the sharpclatter of light arms fire inside the walled headquarters of thePanama Defense Forces. It continued for at least half an hour.   ``They were kisses,'' Noreiga said in response to reporters'questions about the gunshots about an hour after the firing ended.   Noriega appeared at the top of a stairway on one side of theheadquarters building dressed in civilian clothes and accompaniedby members of his high command. To reporters' shouted questions,the general responded: ``What happened is that you are visiting ushere.''   Boris Moreno, a civilian spokesman for the government, said asmall group of lower-ranking officers had attempted a coup and thatseveral were detained.   A revolt in the military would be a serious blow to Noriega, whoheads the nation's 15,000-member Defense Forces and is consideredto be the real power behind Panama's civilian government.   Washington has been exerting pressure to drive him from power.President Reagan said Tuesday the United States wants him ``out ofthere.'' The economy has been crippled by U.S. sanctions.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater declined comment on thetrouble in Panama. ``I don't have any information to confirm thereport. We are aware there is turmoil in the city.''   In Washington, the Pentagon announced the U.S. Southern Commandhad ordered U.S. servicemen and their dependents ``not to go intopublic areas except for essential business.''   Officials of the Panama Canal Commission in Washington confirmedthat a coup was attempted and said roads leading to the canal hadbeen blocked. The Defense Forces had closed off the entrance to aU.S. air base near the canal administrative headquarters in Balboa,on the Pacific side, they said.   ``The canal area is pretty well isolated,'' William R. Gianelli,chairman of the commission's board of directors, told the HouseTransportation Appropriations subcommittee. ``But it is hard totell from here exactly what that means.''   Dennis P. McAuliffe, administrator of the commission, said he``would not regard (the blockade) as a hostile act at this moment.''   Earlier, two Associated Press reporters and a photographer werestopped by soldiers as they approached the headquarters, forcedfrom their car and marched into the compound at gunpoint.   As they were being held inside, they saw at least one officerwith his hands behind his head being taken into a barracks behindthe headquarters building. But a captain told them the apparentprisoner was simply taking part ``in a simulated exercise.''   The captain, who declined to identify himself and wore no nametag, said units at the headquarters periodically conduct trainingexercises aimed at halting coup attempts.   ``Everything is normal,'' he said.   Hundreds of soldiers in battle gear surrounded the headquarters,in one of the older sections of Panama City. Residents were kept atleast a block away from the compound.   Reports said the coup attempt was led by the 3rd InfantryCompany of the 5th Battallon from Chiriqui Province, borderingPanama's frontier with Costa Rican. The light infantry company isknown as the ``Diablos Rojos,'' or Red Devils.   In Venezuela, Panamanian Roberto Diaz Herrera said today Noreigawas ``very angry'' following the reported coup attempt, but wasstill in control of the situation. Diaz Herrera, a former colonelwho has been in exile since December, said he spoke with Noriega bytelephone at about 10 a.m.   ``He sounded either drunk or drugged and he was very angry,''Diaz Herrera told The Associated Press shortly after theconversation. ``It seems (Noriega's supporters) still have controlof the situation.''   Diaz was second in command to Noriega before accusing thegeneral of having ordered political assassinations and beinginvolved in drug trafficking.   Noriega was indicted by two federal grand juries in Florida lastmonth on narcotics trafficking charges that link him with thenotorious Medellin drug cartel of Colombia. He has denied theaccusations.   On Feb. 25, President Eric Arturo Delvalle announced he wasdismissing Noriega as defense chief and replacing him with Col.Marcos Justines, chief of staff. Justines refused the job.   The Noriega-dominate National Assembly quickly ousted Delvalleand named Education Minister Manuel Solis Palma the new head ofstate.   Widespread protests and general strikes followed.</TEXT></DOC>
