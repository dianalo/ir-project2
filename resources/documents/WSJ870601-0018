The Brits are coming! Hanson Trust is after General Mills. Expect a deal to break any day.&quot;    &quot;Psst! Lockheed's a goner. Chrysler's there with $70 a share. So is Ford Motor. But GE's ready to trump all bids with a $74-a-share offer of its own.&quot;    After a brief silence on Wall Street, takeover rumors are flying about again. There hasn't been a shred of news to justify last week's stock-price gains of 6% for General Mills and 15% for Lockheed. Yet rumors are multiplying, and they are having a spillover effect, buoying the stock prices of whole industry groups.    The General Mills run-up helped boost other food stocks, with Kellogg rising 3 7/8 for the week, Borden 2 1/2, Quaker Oats 3 5/8 and Campbell Soup 1 7/8. Meanwhile Lockheed's take-off helped shares of Boeing, McDonnell Douglas, General Dynamics and Raytheon -- although many food and defense issues eased Friday.    The resurgent speculation comes courtesy of the two-month stall in the stock market's rally. After the first quarter's incredibly broad run-up that made it seem easy to pick a winning stock, market players these days are agonizing about their selections -- and rediscovering their appetite for takeover rumors.    Suddenly eager to feed that appetite are Wall Street's takeover-stock arbitragers. Lately many &quot;arbs&quot; have begun to think the crackdown on insider trading by Rudolph Giuliani, the U.S. Attorney in New York, less threatening than they once judged it.    In the months after Nov. 14, when the feds dropped the net on Ivan Boesky for insider trading abuses, takeover rumor-mongering among the arbs seemed to disappear.    Arbs grumbled that they didn't know whom they could trust anymore after Mr. Boesky and some other felons ran among them packing hidden tape recorders. One arb took to carrying around his passport because, he confided, &quot;these days you never know when you'll have to travel quickly.&quot;    In the dead of winter, one particularly nervous pair of arbs who were swapping notes on deals decided to shiver through their daily post-lunch meetings outdoors. They met on a bench in Battery Park, far away from the madding crowd -- and from any federal wiretaps.    Now such caution is a dimly remembered nightmare, arbs say. Their barely disguised glee reflects Mr. Giuliani's delay in making a case against three arbs accused by Martin Siegel, the former Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. merger whiz who was one of Mr. Boesky's partners in crime.    Mr. Giuliani's recent agreement to drop indictments against the three -- Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co.'s Robert M. Freeman and two former Kidder officials, Timothy L. Tabor and Richard B. Wigton -- &quot;amounts to an admission that he can't make a case against them,&quot; one arb says.    Well, maybe. But the government has said that it will seek to indict the three again on broader charges.    And many traders and other Wall Street professionals fear that other arbitragers, investment bankers, money managers and corporate raiders -- perhaps dozens -- could be hit with federal charges in a stream of new cases &quot;that go beyond the simple game of 'you give me the information, and I'll give you a bag of money,'&quot; says a merger adviser. A new wave of indictments could once again throw sand in the gears of the market's rumor mill.    The merger adviser worries that the feds -- who decline to discuss their strategy -- may suspect a broad Wall Street conspiracy involving coordinated, systematic abuse of inside information. He also wonders if Mr. Boesky, who has been a central witness in the federal investigation, joined in any such scheme.    Perish the thought. Nearly three years ago there was a hot rumor that Mr. Boesky and Mr. Siegel were part of an insider trading ring. Both flatly denied the rumor then.    &quot;How could you think I'd do such a thing (as trade on inside information)?&quot; Mr. Boesky said at the time. &quot;And, if I did, how could you think I'd be dumb enough to do it with other people?&quot;    ---   Friday's Market Activity   Stocks finished the week mixed, with a late-afternoon sell-off depressing some blue-chip issues.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 19.11 to 2291.57. Several sell programs tied to stock index futures accounted for much of the late sell-off, traders said. The Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.66 to 290.10 and the New York Stock Exchange composite lost 0.13 to 163.48. Despite the decline in the leading market indexes, gainers had almost a 9-to-6 lead over losers on the Big Board.    An opening advance on news of a larger-than-expected 0.6% decline in April's index of leading economic indicators turned out to be short-lived. Analysts had interpreted the news as a sign the economy remains sluggish, making the chance of an interest-rate boost by the Federal Reserve Board less likely. Japan's economic stimulus package, released Friday, was generally viewed as positive.    &quot;I don't think there's going to be an assault on the old highs any time soon,&quot; said Jack Baker, head of capital commitment at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.    There was profit-taking in many sectors of the market, such as technology, and in many stocks that had been driven up by takeover rumors earlier in the week, traders said. Lockheed fell 3 1/8 to 50 5/8.    Allegis fell 1 to 86 1/2 after soaring 8 3/8 Thursday on news of its recapitalization plan.    Harcourt Brace Jovanovich eased 1/8 to 55 1/4 on volume of 4.81 million shares. It was the busiest issue on the Big Board Friday.    Harcourt said it bought back about 4.8 million shares in the past three days and plans to offer to sell these shares, on ex-dividend basis, to its employee stock ownership plan. </TEXT></DOC>
