The South Lebanon Army militia, trained and supplied by Israel,helps Israeli soldiers patrol the zone just inside Lebanon and helpsthem fight Moslem guerrillas hostile to Israel.   At least 70 Lebanese have been expelled from the zone in the pastmonth, apparently because they refused to cooperate with the militia.   Marrack Goulding, undersecretary-general in charge ofpeacekeeping operations, complained over the weekend about theexpulsions and tension between peacekeepers and Israel to JohananBein, the Israeli U.N. ambassador, U.N. spokesman Francois Giulianisaid Monday.   No appropriate officials were at the Israeli mission Monday torespond.   Ambassador Rachid Fakhoury of Lebanon released a letter toSecretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar on Monday complaining ofIsrael's activities in south Lebanon.   ``Terrorism, blockade, harassment, deprivation of freedoms,raids, expulsion, demolition of homes, torture, imprisonment andpressures are essential elements of daily life even in the areascontrolled by the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon,'' he said.   ``Not one week goes by without the Israeli army expelling groupsor individuals from the region.''</TEXT></DOC>
