Under the proposal, GSA Administrator Terence Golden said, the government's &quot;commitment&quot; under the contract would end in less than four years, rather than the 10-year period currently envisioned. As a result, he said the government would be committed to spend less than $3 billion with its chosen vendor.    According to some estimates, the federal government would spend as much as $25 billion under the 10-year contract. But most observers doubt the total would exceed about $5 billion.    The contract is for a state-of-the-art telecommunications network for federal government agencies. The network will allow users to communicate on the phone while sending and receiving data on a computer screen.    Mr. Golden's proposal was contained in a letter to House Government Operations Committee Chairman Jack Brooks (D., Texas), who has been pressing him to rewrite the telecommunications proposal to pick two bidders instead of one. Mr. Golden rejected that proposal and offered to slash the guaranteed length of the contract instead.    After the four-year period, Mr. Golden added, the government would evaluate whether to continue service, ask for revisions or open the bid up for a new competition. He further proposed creating an independent panel to advise the GSA and Congress about the best route to take.    Currently, only two teams of companies are preparing bids, which are due at the end of the month. One team includes American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. and a unit of aerospace concern Boeing Co. The other includes Martin Marietta Corp. and MCI Communications Corp.    Jerry Thames, Martin Marietta's vice president, communications systems, said last night that Mr. Golden's proposal about the guaranteed portion of the contract might simply be a restatement of the existing requirements. But the proposal for an independent panel is new, he added.    Mr. Thames didn't indicate whether he would support the changes. But he reiterated that Martin Marrietta will drop out of the bidding if the proposal is rewritten to choose two groups of companies. ATandamp;T has said it will continue to bid regardless of changes. &quot;We'll go with the flow, &quot; an ATandamp;T spokesman said last night, adding that the company wasn't aware of the GSA letter.    Rep. Brooks, who has long favored added competition in government contracts, wants the GSA to select two teams, which would split the revenue on a 70-30 basis. The winners would rebid every three years to see who gets the larger share of the business.    U.S. Sprint Communications Co., which was part of a team of companies that dropped out of bidding for the project, has been lobbying for the Brooks proposal as a way to get back into the bidding. But should Martin Marietta drop out, and MCI not be able to find another company to team with, the government could be stuck with only two bidding teams again. U.S. Sprint is a joint venture of GTE Corp., Stamford, Conn., and United Telecommunications Inc., Kansas City, Mo.    ATandamp;T would benefit from any delay because the government is now paying it higher phone rates than it would under a new contract. ATandamp;T won a one-month delay recently from the GSA after it protested that it was hindered by Federal Communications Commission regulations. It also has asked a federal district court to bar the regional Bell companies from providing routing and switching functions for the Martin Marietta team. Federal Judge Harold Greene hasn't yet ruled on the case.    Mr. Golden has estimated that rewriting the contract for two winning teams would delay the award by a year or two. But Rep. Brooks estimates the delay at about half a year.    Rep. Brooks and Mr. Golden couldn't be reached for comment on the latest proposal, nor could representatives of US Sprint and MCI. </TEXT></DOC>
