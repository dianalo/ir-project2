U.S. District Judge Barrington Parker issued a temporaryrestraining order Thursday protecting information generated on theprofessional office system, or PROFS. The system, put in operationin 1985, is used by NSC personnel and White House staff tocommunicate on an internal electronic mail network.   Former national security adviser John Poindexter and fired NSCaide Oliver North used the system frequently. From it, congressionaland criminal investigators retrieved messages in reconstructing theIran-Contra affair.   Assistant Attorney General John Bolton argued at a hearing thatstopping the ``housecleaning'' process of getting rid of informationwould impair operations of the incoming Bush administration.   But Parker said the decision to block the destruction wasmaintenance of the status quo and questioned whether harm would bedone by keeping information in the system intact.   Parker issued the restraining order at the request of theNational Security Archive, a private repository of governmentinformation, and a division of the American Civil Liberties Union. Ahearing on a request for a preliminary injunction will be heldWednesday before U.S. District Judge Charles Richey.   The groups sued President Reagan, President-elect George Bush andthe archivist of the United States, saying in a statement they aretrying to prevent the destruction of ``historically significantWhite House computer tapes ... during the last three years of theReagan administration.''   The information in the system is contained on magnetic tapeswhich ``we were told the White House destroys from time to time,''attorney Kate Martin said at a hearing where Parker granted therestraining order.   ``The Iran-Contra affair illustrated the importance ofinformation stored in the PROFS system,'' Scott Armstrong, founderof the National Security Archive, a non-profit group, said in anaffidavit. ``Despite repeated attempts by NSC staff to shred thepaper record and delete the computer record, the PROFS backup systemon magnetic tape allowed investigators to reconstruct much of theIran-Contra-related activity.''   The computer tapes ``are the only existing record of manyimportant communications within the White House and specificallywithin the National Security Council at the close of the Reaganadministration,'' Ms. Martin said in a memorandum filed in federalcourt.   Bolton, chief of the Justice Department's civil division said,however, the destruction is ``not some sinister conspiracy.''   ``The archivist has given approval to erase these systems'' andnone of the information has ``any relevance'' or ``anything to dowith the Iran-Contra affair,'' said Bolton.   Bolton compared the system to an electronic mail setup in placeat the Justice Department in which people can play back theirmessages when they return to the office rather than having to play``telephone tag.''   Guidance issued by the archives and White House counsel instructsPROFS users to print out in paper form any significant PROFSmessages for the permanent files, and only those paper records areconsidered presidential records and permanently preserved.</TEXT></DOC>
