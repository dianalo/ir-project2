Now he's got his answer, in the form of ``Par Excellence!'' _ anindoor 18-hole miniature golf course that opened Saturday at agallery owned by the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. It wasdesigned by O'Brien and 21 other Chicago artists.   Gone are the Dutch Windmills and Chinese pagodas. In their placeare wrecked cars, earthquake debris, cemeteries and nuclear weapons.   Players can putt over the bottle-cap strewn floor of a tavern,into a corporate boardroom and through an archway dedicated to``tasteless home improvement materials.''   At the 18th hole, the Grim Reaper gets the ball _ and keeps it.   O'Brien did the 13th hole himself.   ``It's called `In Search of Par Excellence,' after a popularbusiness book,'' said O'Brien as he put the finishing touchesSaturday on his hardwood trimmed miniature executive suite.   ``You shoot through the sales bar graph, and if you hit topsales, your ball goes into the corner office _ the one with thepicture windows and the hole,'' he said. ``If your sales are lower,you wind up in a less desirable office and have to take moreshots.''   The course, playable at $2 a round, will be in place throughAugust 20.</TEXT><DATELINE>BLUEFIELD, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Giving away lemonade is cheaper thangiving away hotel rooms when it's hot. If you have to give awaysomething, that is.   The Chamber of Commerce here feels the obligation whenever thetemperature tops 90 degrees, which is not supposed to happen oftenin ``Nature's Air-Conditioned City.''   ``Lemonade Lassies'' in shorts were set for another giveawaytoday after a weekend on which the town sweltered through itshottest day ever _ 96 degrees _ on Saturday.   Even at $100 a day during this record-setting heat wave, thegiveaway is proving much cheaper than the first ``stunt'' thechamber tried.   ``When we first started, we went to the hotel and theyreluctantly agreed not to charge for rooms whenever the temperaturewent above 90 degrees,'' said chamber member Eddie Steele.   ``By golly, it was within two weeks that the hotel was jammed tothe rafters with a convention of Moose'' when the next heat wavehit. The angry hotel paid off, but ``we only gave away the hotelrooms once,'' Steele said.   That was 50 years ago, and the switch to lemonade was on.   In the past, whole summers have passed without Bluefield givingaway one drop, partly because the temperature of record is at theairport, which generally has lower readings than downtown.   When the mark reaches 90, a lemonade giveaway is set for thenext day, except when it reaches 90 on a weekend, when the giveawayis set for the next workday. After Saturday's 96, the high was``only'' 89 on Sunday.   ``We've had to do it about five or six times, which is the mostwe've had in 10 or 15 years,'' Steele said.   Between 300 and 400 people a day have shown up at the chamber'slemonade stands downtown. Steele is certain townfolk take advantage.   ``They go out of their way to get it,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
