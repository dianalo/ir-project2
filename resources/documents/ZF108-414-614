(Case WesternReserve University experimenting with Synchronous Optical Network)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Wexler, Joanie M.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Case Western Reserve University is installing fiber-optic cabling,based on the emerging Synchronous Optical Network (SONET)protocol, that will allow students and faculty to access voice,data, video, and imaging services simultaneously.andP;  The new systemuses a fiber backbone running at 250M-bps.andP;  SONET is designed toallow interoperability across multiple vendors' high speedcommunications platforms.andP;  Case Western plans to create ametropolitan area network (MAN) on its own property despite thefact that SONET products are intended primarily for telephonecompany central offices.andP;  The university will also install FiberDistributed Data Interface (FDDI) equipment to connect slowerspeed networks.andP;  Its SONET system will eventually link 2,800undergraduates, 7,000 graduate students, and faculty and staff in85 buildings at a cost of $2.8 million.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Colleges and UniversitiesCase StudySONET (Computer Network Protocol)Fiber OpticsEthernetCase Western Reserve University.andM;</DESCRIPT></DOC>
