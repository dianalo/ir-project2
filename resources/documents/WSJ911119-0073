Lawyers and HIV-rights advocates say that people who testpositive for HIV -- such as basketball star Magic Johnson --are thrust into a new legal arena. Nationwide, civil rightsfor people with HIV are still taking shape, and some courtshave begun to carve out loopholes in their legal protections.</LP><TEXT>   The vagaries in the law are bound to affect the growingnumber of people with HIV-related discrimination claims. U.S.health officials estimate that more than one millionAmericans are now infected with HIV.   Attorneys agree that under the Americans With DisabilitiesAct, which starts to take effect next year, it will beillegal for most companies to fire or even reassign anemployee solely because the person is HIV-positive. But manystates have had such laws for years, and HIV positive workersstill face job discrimination. Federal law has banned housingdiscrimination against people with HIV since 1989 -- butcomplaints of illegal evictions are still on the rise.   &quot;The discrimination has remained high and pervasive,&quot; saysEvan Wolfson, an attorney with Lambda Legal Defense andEducation Fund, a gay and lesbian civil rights organizationthat often handles HIV-discrimination cases.   People with HIV are also likely to face other legalproblems, attorneys say. In many states, they face criminalcharges if they don't inform their sex partners of their HIVstatus. And at a much earlier age than most of their peers,people with HIV are seeking legal help to prepare wills,arrange for the care of their children, and turn overpower-of-attorney in anticipation of debilitating illness.                                                                                                          EMPLOYMENT                                                                                                          Many states prohibit employers from discriminating againstpeople with HIV under laws protecting the disabled. The U.S.government and companies that get federal funds also can'tdiscriminate.   The Americans With Disabilities Act will extend thoseprotections, making such discrimination illegal at anycompany with at least 25 employees, starting in July. By1996, the law will apply to companies with at least 15employees.   The law has more teeth than most state laws: Under theact, a person with HIV will be able to sue for punitivedamages in bias cases. Punitive damages, meant to deterwrongdoing, typically exceed actual, compensatory damages.   But plaintiffs' attorneys say that many people with HIVwill be reluctant to pursue such cases. In small cities andrural areas, where there are few cases of AIDS, many peoplefear making their conditions known. The prospect of spendingone's last healthy years in court also discourages somepeople.   &quot;Rather than try and assert their legal rights, they lettheir jobs go,&quot; says Michele Zavos, staff director of theAmerican Bar Association's AIDS Coordination Project.   Attorneys say that a critical but unanswered question indiscrimination cases is whether courts will exempt certainjobs, mainly in the health-care field, from the act. The lawdoesn't apply if the worker's illness poses a significantthreat to others and if the employer can't find a reasonableway to eliminate that risk.   &quot;Just as we're still seeing litigation over the CivilRights Act some 27 years later, we'll be litigating ADAissues well into the next century,&quot; says Michael Soltis, alabor attorney at Jackson, Lewis, Schnitzler andamp; Krupman, NewYork.                                                                                                          HOUSING                                                                                                          Congress amended the Fair Housing Act in 1989 to ban allhousing discrimination against people with HIV. But civilrights attorneys say such discrimination accounts for a largeportion of all HIV/AIDS bias claims, most often involvingrented apartments. They say housing claims are difficult topursue because landlords usually give other reasons forevictions or not making repairs.   In New York, for example, a state administrative law judgerecently ruled against a tenant who claimed he was beingharassed by his landlord because he was HIV-positive. Thejudge found that the landlord had a legitimate reason toevict because the tenant owed $85 in late fees. But attorneysfor the tenant argue that the landlord wouldn't have gone tosuch lengths just because of a relatively small breach of thelease agreement.                                                                                                          INSURANCE                                                                                                          People with HIV haven't had much success challengingrestrictions on insurance benefits. Courts have also clearedthe way for insurers to consider a person's HIV status indeciding whether to approve a policy.   HIV-rights attorneys say smaller companies are more likelyto simply cut an HIV-positive employee's benefits than tofire the worker. &quot;Employment issues are moving more and moreaway from fear of contagion, except in the health-careindustry, to fear of costs,&quot; says William Rubenstein, head ofthe American Civil Liberties Union's AIDS Project.   The attorneys say they are seeing an increase in companiesputting caps on the benefits they will pay for HIV-positiveworkers. Earlier this month a federal appeals court in NewOrleans ruled that a $5,000 lifetime cap on AIDS-relatedinsurance claims was permissible.   HIV-positive policyholders have gone to court to forceinsurers to pay for treatments that the insurance industryconsiders experimental. In one case involving a bone-marrowtransplant, a New York state judge ruled in favor of thepolicyholder, but by then the plaintiff had developed aninfection that made the transplant impossible.                                                                                                          HEALTH CARE                                                                                                          Access to health care is one of the most emotional issuesinvolving the civil rights of people with HIV. Larry Gostin,a Harvard University professor of health law and the directorof the U.S. AIDS Litigation Project, says HIV discriminationclaims are &quot;almost systemic&quot; in the nursing-home industry andare up sharply against dentists.   Usually courts and state regulators have ruled in favor ofpeople with HIV in health-care access cases. And thedisabilities act is expected to make it easier to resolvemany of the disputes, because it clearly establishes thatdentist offices, nursing homes and other medical facilitiesare public accommodations.   Even emergency care has been denied in some cases. Earlierthis year a volunteer fire department near Denver stoppedanswering first-aid calls involving people infected with HIV.The policy was dropped a month later after a flood ofprotests and threats of suits.   Such problems are more common in communities where AIDScases are just now being noticed. Jeffrey Been, director ofthe HIV/AIDS Legal Project in Indianapolis, says he isinvestigating reports of a dentist who charges a &quot;special HIVpreparation fee&quot; to patients infected with the virus, and afuneral home that charges an &quot;extra handling fee&quot; for deathsinvolving HIV or AIDS.                                                                                                          OTHER LEGAL ISSUES                                                                                                          Discrimination isn't the only legal area that HIV carriersmust be concerned about. Several states have laws thatprovide harsh penalties for HIV-positive people who bite orspit upon someone, although medical officials saytransmission in that manner is virtually impossible.   Another growing area of concern is HIV's role in familylaw. As more women become infected, the issue of their HIVstatus is raised more often in custody matters, attorneyssay.</TEXT></DOC>
