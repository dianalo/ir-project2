But Southwestern Bell Co. reported flatearnings, and Pacific Telesis Group posted an 8.9% drop.   Results were generally what analysts anticipated. &quot;Growthis very much in line with expectations,&quot; said FrankGovernali, an analyst with First Boston Corp. &quot;Ameritech wasthe only one with any surprise at all.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Nynex, which took a $39 million onetime charge for anearly retirement program, reported a 7.7% increase in netincome due to gains in its telephone operations, mobilecommunications and software subsidiaries. Revenue rose to$3.44 billion from $3.3 billion. About 4,000 managers of NewYork-based Nynex signed up for the special early-retirementprogram. &quot;It looks like Nynex had slightly more and earliercost reductions than expected,&quot; said Dan Reingold, an analystat Morgan Stanley andamp; Co.   Profit of Chicago-based Ameritech surprised some analysts,surging 11.3% with strong volume growth in access lines, tollcalls and minutes of use. A tight rein on costs helped toboost net income to $352.3 million. During the quarter,Ameritech and Bell Atlantic Corp., along with two New Zealandcompanies, were chosen by the New Zealand government to buythe state-owned telephone company for about $2.4 billion.   BellSouth's net income rose 6.5%, but revenue growth, up5.7%, was damped by rate reductions in several Southeaststates. The Atlanta-based company's cellular unit added62,355 customers in the quarter and reported income of $13.1million compared with a $2.6 million loss the year earlier.   Southwestern Bell's net income edged up 0.4%, despite a1.9% drop in phone company income due to rate cutbacks and aone-time $18.1 million pretax charge for inventory. Resultswere helped by 71,000 new cellular customers added during theperiod, more than twice the number of new customers thatsigned up the year before. Without the write-down forinventory, St. Louis-based Southwestern's earnings would be90 cents a share, compared with 83 cents the year before.   Pacific Telesis blamed a new rate structure in California,investment in network improvements, labor contracts anddepreciation of equipment. Earnings for the quarter were $287million, or 72 cents a share, compared with $325 million, or79 cents a share, the year before. Pacific Telesis, based inSan Francisco, reported revenue of $2.43 billion, vs. $2.4billion.
