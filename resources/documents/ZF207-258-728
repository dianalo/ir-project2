(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>OPERATORS BEING BOMBED THROUGH PRIMARY PORTALandM;It starts with a lowly message, then it graduates to an inference, andculminates in an action.andM;Along the way, some serious systems software expertise must come into play.andO;What better place to find it than at ATandamp;T's MVS service center for the 12ATandamp;T regional data centers nationwide?andM;True, ATandamp;T is the &quot;Unix&quot; vendor, but being the large corporate entity that itis, ATandamp;T is also a significant user of IBM mainframe software.andP;  As such, themainframe systems professionals at ATandamp;T's Orlando, Fla., data center are veryinterested in pursuing the latest in MVS automated operations.andM;The automated operations &quot;platform&quot; being developed in Orlando will be rolledout across ATandamp;T's 11 other data centers in the U.S.andP;  The rollout has startedtaking place, much to the benefit of MVS Software of Los Angeles and Houston,whose OPS/MVS package has been adopted by ATandamp;T as a key tool in this earlystage of automated operations.andM;In a distinction from IBM automated operations directions, as defined byNetview and Netview/PC, the ATandamp;T MVS team plans to design its host automatedoperations to complement the company's Unified Network ManagementArchitecture (UNMA) scheme.andP;  To the extent UNMA and Netview are responsiblefor network management, the two are or will be competitors.andP;  But, since UNMAencompasses the management of data and voice, its design is a bit more grandthan that of Netview to date.andM;However, for the moment, Netview has the numbers.andP;  Jeff Schulman, automatedoperations specialist at the Gartner Group, Stamford, Conn., estimates thatNetview is installed in 50% of IBM MVS data centers in the U.S.andM;But Schulman is no fan of IBMs Netview strategy.andP;  Speaking of the ATandamp;Teffort, he said, &quot;These guys have grabbed the focus and are way ahead of IBMin their network management approach.&quot;andM;Schulman called Netview's penetration rate to date &quot;a tribute to IBM'smarketing power.&quot;andP;  He added, &quot;Users who need to bring heterogeneous networksunder control can probably learn from ATandamp;T about the requiements.&quot;andP;  Withinits data centers, ATandamp;T runs Amdahl and IBM mainframes, Teradata databasemachines, ATandamp;T 3B minicomputers, and various storage and communicationshardware.andM;ATandamp;T's two data centers in Orlando have a total of 145,000 square feet offloor space, which is managed as a single site over 350 mips of processingpower.andP;  The centers have direct access to some 2,500Gb of DASD.andP;  Orlandosupports both application development production and testing users fromacross the U.S.andM;Prior to the evolution of the ATandamp;T UNMA strategy, which has only recentlybegun to be delivered with the announcement of the Accumaster ConsolidatedWorkstation, IBM MVS users in effect had little choice in network management.andM;Perhaps the only straight-on alternative to Netview for the past few yearshas been NetMaster from Cincom Systems, Inc., Cincinnati.andP;  And Cincom hasbeen invited by ATandamp;T to develop a critical piece of the UNMA architecture.andM;MADE THE BUSINESS CASEandM;The author of the business case and the chief architect for MVS automationwithin ATandamp;T has been Jim Vane, senior technical consultant in MVS SystemsSupport, Maitland, Fla.andP;  Maitland houses a central support organization thatfurnishes the 12 ATandamp;T data centers nationwide with operating systems andmajor operational subsystems.andP;  (It does not service Bell Labs.)andP;  It fallswithin the Information Management Services division of ATandamp;T, which isessentially the data processing entity of the corporation.andM;Vane's business case for automated operations was accepted by ATandamp;T managementfor funding.andP;  The thrust of the business case was to simply solve some realproblems in the data centers.andM;ATandamp;T defines automated operations the same way as Dr. Leilani Allen,consultant.andP;  (See box.)andM;The goal of automated operations at ATandamp;T is being met in three phases.andP;  Phaseone is message rate relief.andM;Message traffic in large data centers is becoming impossible for humanoperators to handle.andP;  IBM estimates that 0.2 messages per second per mip ofprocessing power installed arrive at the operator's console, which Vane callsthe &quot;primary portal,&quot; to control the computer system.andP;  This works out to aneffective average rate of 20 messages per second on a 100+ mip processor,such as an IBM 3090 Model 600s, or an Amdahl 5990, Model 1400.andP;  Peak messagerates of 100 per second have been observed in ATandamp;T data centers.andM;Human engineering studies performed by IBM indicate that operators can handle0.25 messages per second.andP;  At rates exceeding two per second, operatorscannot read the messages.andM;&quot;In many cases, operators are coping with this message rate by ignoring theconsoles,&quot; Vane stated.andP;  Operators respond instead to phone calls fromharried users.andP;  This is &quot;reactive mode.&quot;andM;Terry Burnett, the ATandamp;T district manager for MVS Systems Support in Maitland,makes an important distinction that is often repeated by members of hisautomation team: &quot;It boils down to 'proactive' systems management instead of'reactive.'andP;  We're trying to build systems to prevent system failures.&quot;andM;In results from automation pilot applications at ATandamp;T data centers inAlpharetta, Ga., and Fairhaven, Mass., operators have seen a 70% to 75%reduction in message traffic.andP;  The result is not surprising to Vane.andM;In fact, reports of dramatic message reductions were made by several users ofconsole management software users on a panel at AFCOM in San Diego earlierthis year.andP;  But the steps taken before implementing such software seem tovary greatly.andM;The ATandamp;T automation team has been extremely sensitive to the concerns of itsunionized operators.andP;  The automation effort began with a survey of operators,to learn the issues as they saw them, and to help set requirements forautomation applications.andP;  No message is suppressed without the operatorsknowing.andM;Charles Pettitt, MVS systems support manager in Maitland, works closely withthe operations staff in Orlando to develop automation requirements.andP;  He said,&quot;Once the operators understand the needs, they tend to be supportive.andP;  Theytend to feel threatened until they understand the needs.andP;  We've tried to helpthem understand.&quot;andM;Burnett said, &quot;We have attempted to focus on job enrichment.andP;  A reduction ofthe redundant and trivial tasks will help people to grow professionally.andP;  Wedon't view it as threatening.&quot;andM;After evaluating many automation tools available, ATandamp;T chose OPS/MVS from MVSsoftware, Houston, as its automation platform.andP;  (ATandamp;T declined to disclosewhat other products were evaluated.) OPS/MVS uses IBM's SAA-compliant Rexxprocedurall language, seen as the successor to the Clist language long usedby TSO programmers.andM;The open architecture of OPS/MVS, which runs as an MVS subsystem, met animportant ATandamp;T requirement.andP;  Other requirements were 24-hour, seven-daysupport, technical qualifications of the company, and quality of the code.andM;&quot;[MVS software] has satisfied a tremendous number of requirements in shortorder,&quot; Vane said.andP;  OPS/MVS currently runs on 20 MVS/XA machines in ATandamp;T datacenters, and will be installed on the remaining machines over the next fewmonths.andM;OPS/MVS traps data from various data center management packages, such as theUCC-7 job scheduler from Computer Associates.andP;  The trapped data is fed to aninterpreter designed to assist the operator.andP;  The interpreter analyzes themessage, evaluates it, and can delete it, disperse it, or suppress it.andP;  Itcan be dispersed by matching with route codes.andP;  It can be suppressed bymatching against a &quot;suppression list.&quot;andM;The message suppression list was developed by a committee representing all 12ATandamp;T data centers, Vane said.andP;  In addition to the suppression list, the groupdeveloped a list of optional messages (based on data center preference), anda list of required messages.andM;Once the vast majority of routine messages have been filtered out, theremaining messages are the most challenging.andM;This is where phase two of the automation comes in: &quot;automated operatorresponse.&quot;andP;  In this phase, messages are being processed to either issuecommands internally, or gather more information, or generate an &quot;alert&quot; tothe operator.andP;  The alert is generated to an ISPF full screen interface.andM;With the full screen interface, &quot;The operator interacts with automationsoftware to solve the problem, as opposed to issuing system commands.andP;  Thesystem provides options and may solve the problem with the operator'sconcurrence,&quot; Vane said.andM;In early March, the automation team began rolling out the applicationscompleted to date.andP;  They call this the &quot;automation platform&quot; or &quot;staging&quot; onwhich the data centers will standardize.andP;  Each of the 12 ATandamp;T data centerswill build customized applications for their own use.andP;  As of mid-April, abouthalf of 45 defined applications had been completed.andM;EXPERT SYSTEMS, OF COURSEandM;The scenario would not be complete without an expert system tool.andP;  That isthe third phase of the ATandamp;T automation effort.andM;Products being evaluated for this phase include the DASD Advisor from Boole andamp;Babbage, and DASDMON from Duquesne/Legent, Pittsburgh.andM;An internal expert system called &quot;Deadlock Alert&quot; has been built using IBM'sKnowledge Tool.andP;  The system analyzes &quot;cross system lockout,&quot; in which twoCPUs competing for the same resource become locked in a deadly embrace.andP;  &quot;Ourexpert system makes suggestions to the operator for which jobs to cancel torelease the embrace,&quot; Vane said.andM;Other expert system-building tools beingevaluated include IBM's ExpertSystems Environment and the Application Development System from Aion Corp.,andO;Palo Alto, Calif.andM;Automated operations software vendors are starting to pour forth from thewoodwork.andP;  The first products appeared in about 1985.andP;  New arrivals at theAfcom show included two firms from Ontario, Canada: Tango Software, Inc. ofNorth York and Votek Systems of Richmond Hill.andM;&quot;It's the new frontier.andP;  I think you'll see a lot of products in this area,&quot;said Pettitt.andM;Ironically, the small startups have an advantage.andP;  Vendors with a broadproduct line are perceived as trying to lock customers into their ownautomated operations proprietary interfaces.andP;  Users will resist this.andM;As viable alternatives become available, as apparently OPS/MVS is, thepressure will increase for a more open interface between the systems softwareplayers.andM;Asked what message they would like to deliver to the software vendorcommunity, the ATandamp;T MVS team in Orlando was unanimous: more open interfacesand a consistent application program interface.andP;  Pettitt said, &quot;It'ssolvable, but the vendors have to want to solve it.&quot;andM;The first vendors to adopt and win acceptance for a standard interface willhave an advantage, Vane suggested.andP;  He called IBM's SAA &quot;helpful to somedegree,&quot; but anyone from ATandamp;T will only go so far in supporting IBM.andM;As the broader user community gains experience with automation tools,pressure will increase on software vendors to standardize, suggested MichaelCruz, who has been dealing with the incompatibility issues as the DBMSsupport manager on ATandamp;T's automation team.andM;The fortunate fallout for ATandamp;T of the acceptance of Vane's business case hasbeen to help clarify the boundary between automated operations and networkmanagement.andP;  IBM does not appear to make the distinction, choosing toposition Netview as the answer for both.andP;  But ATandamp;T will be able to show whereautomated operations end and where network management--in this case UNMAstrategy--begins.andM;Burnett said, &quot;Strategically, there is a benefit to ATandamp;T in pursuing this.andO;But to get the original business case okayed, we had to equate it to dollars.andO;We approach automation from a customer viewpoint, the automation of themainframe environment.andP;  We are positioning to link with the UNMA strategy.&quot;andM;Vane said, &quot;We've maintained a dialogue all along the way with UNMA.andP;  We'vealways kept in mind that we would eventually merge.&quot;andM;ATandamp;T's agreement with Cincom calls for Cincom to supply the piece that allowsUNMA to talk to the IBM world.andP;  &quot;Cincom will produce the interface to allowSNA traffic to be processed by UNMA,&quot; said Vane.andM;Both the IBM and ATandamp;T approaches do support the centralization of networkmanagement.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
