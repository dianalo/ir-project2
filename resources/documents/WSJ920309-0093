But the high court's recent rejection of a claim on behalfof a municipal worker who died on the job may foreshadow thejustices' unwillingness to expand property rights in thefashion that some conservatives wish they would.</LP><TEXT>   Property rights are explicitly protected by the FifthAmendment's requirement that the government compensate thosewhose property is taken for public use. One property rightscase pending before the high court provides the justices withan opportunity to clarify when the Fifth Amendment obligesgovernment to pay people whose land isn't formally taken butis diminished in value because of environmental regulation.   Another case the court is expected to decide by earlysummer involves a more controversial claim to protection forproperty rights under the 14th Amendment, rather than theFifth Amendment, and it is to this type of claim that thejustices recently appeared unreceptive.   The 14th Amendment case involves a lawsuit by adevelopment company that alleges the government of PuertoRico arbitrarily refused to issue it a construction permitover a period of years. The company, PFZ Properties,complains that Puerto Rico, a U.S. commonwealth that ispartly governed by the Constitution, violated the 14thAmendment's &quot;due process&quot; clause, which states thatgovernment may not &quot;deprive any person of life, liberty, orproperty, without due process of law.&quot;   That provision has been given two meanings by the highcourt. Its explicit, and more common, guarantee is of a fairprocedure whenever government denies life, liberty orproperty. But the court has also inferred a protection of&quot;substantive due process.&quot; Although it may sound oxymoronic,substantive due process has been interpreted to protectindividual liberty against certain government actions,regardless of the type of procedures.   From the early 1900s through 1937, the Supreme Courtinvoked substantive due process to thwart governmentregulation of property rights, wages and workplaceconditions. But in the wake of the Great Depression andPresident Roosevelt's popular New Deal policies, the highcourt reversed itself. It jettisoned the notion that itshould aggressively defend economic liberties and propertyagainst federal and state regulation. Since then, the courthas exercised restraint when reviewing economic, health andsafety regulation challenged under the 14th Amendment.   It is that restraint that some conservatives want to end.They have urged the court to re-embrace economic liberty byruling that PFZ possesses a substantive due process right toget its construction permit. Puerto Rico, which denies anywrongdoing, argues that even if the permit denial werearbitrary, PFZ's problem doesn't rise to the level of aconstitutional violation.   Puerto Rico officials have reason to be optimistic afterthe high court's decision late last month in a case involvingthe death of Larry Collins, a sanitation worker in HarkerHeights, Texas. Mr. Collins died of asphyxia after entering amanhole to unstop a sewer line. His widow sued HarkerHeights, claiming that her husband had a substantive dueprocess right to be free from unreasonable risks and from thecity's policy of not training its workers adequately.   The Supreme Court ruled unanimously that whatever itsmerits under state law, the Collins claim didn't state aconstitutional violation. Writing in sweeping terms, JusticeJohn Stevens said that the court, at least since the 1930s,has been &quot;reluctant to expand the concept of substantive dueprocess because guideposts for responsible decision-making inthis unchartered area are scarce and open-ended.&quot;   &quot;The doctrine of judicial self-restraint,&quot; he continued,&quot;requires us to exercise the utmost care whenever we areasked to break new ground in this field.&quot; The court'srejection of the Collins claim also &quot;rests on the presumptionthat the administration of government programs is based on arational decision-making process that takes account ofcompeting social, political and economic forces,&quot; JusticeStevens wrote.   Donald Ayer, a veteran Supreme Court litigator, observesthat despite the entirely different factual context, theCollins case doesn't augur well for property rights claimsasserted under the theory of substantive due process.   Some justices may be interested in &quot;adding teeth&quot; to theFifth Amendment's explicit protection against uncompensatedtakings, says Mr. Ayer. &quot;But there's a big difference&quot;between enforcing language that is actually in theConstitution and reviving an implicit guarantee under the14th Amendment that went out of style more than 50 years ago.The ease with which the court rejected the Collins claimappears to indicate little interest in such a revival.</TEXT></DOC>
