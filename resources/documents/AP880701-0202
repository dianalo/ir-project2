Newspapers reported that Romania began turning back Hungariantourists. It expelled a group of Hungarian diplomats Tuesday.   A Parliament resolution adopted Friday said the fellowSoviet-bloc nation had violated ``the funamental human, nationaland nationalities-related rights.''   It did not mention Romania's decision to close a Hungarianconsulate and expel its staff, or the Romanian order closing aHungarian cultural center in Bucharest.   The resolution said a planned resettlement project that mayaffect 7,000 Romanian villages, including many where ethnicHungarians live, would be ``contrary to the spirit of humanism aswell as to the concept of socialism.''   Hungary says the plan to move residents of 7,000 villages to newagricultural-industrial centers would destroy the culture andtraditions of Romania's ethnic Hungarian minority. Romania says itwill help villagers by providing services now found only in cities.   Relations reached an unprecedented low this week and Hungarianleaders appealed to Romania not to make the situation worse.   ``We will always be cooperating partners,'' Parliament SpeakerIstvan Szueroes said when he presented the resolution on Romania.``Unfortunately, (relations) are still further deteriorating.''   He said Hungary was prepared to proceed with preparations for aproposed meeting of premiers.   Some newspapers said Hungarians trying to enter Romania werebeing turned back, and at some border points only people in transitthrough Romania were allowed to cross. the evening daily EstiHirlap, however, quoted a Hungarian border official as saying``there is no ban'' on Hungarian travel.   Romania's decision to close a consulate in Cluj inTraynsylvania, where most of the 1.7 ethnic Hungarians live, cameafter 50,000 people marched past the Romanian Embassy in Budapeston Monday to protest the resettlement plan.   In its resolution, Parliament said carrying out the program``would ... impose new burdens on Hungarian-Romanian relations,''the resolution said.</TEXT></DOC>
