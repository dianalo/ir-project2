Negotiators from Washington and Bonn sought to strike aconciliatory deal stressing a united front on protecting tropicalrain forests and playing down their dispute over what should bedone about pollutants that contribute to warming of the Earth'sclimate, summit sources said.   Details of the forest protection accord were unavailable inadvance of an afternoon session of the seven-nation economic summitdealing with the environment. The agreement is to be included inthe final summit communique that will be issued Wednesday.   Word of the negotiating bid for harmony on the environmentalissue emerged one day after West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl andWhite House chief of staff John Sununu exchanged critical jabs overtheir countries' divergent approaches to global warming.   Sununu accused the West Germans of being leaders in globalwarming rhetorics. Kohl took aim at President Bush's call forfurther study of the problem rather than hasty action that mightcause needless economic damage.   U.S. officials had gotten the impression in pre-summit talksthat the Germans might take a flexible stance at the summit ontheir calls for specific goals for reducing emissions of carbondioxide and other ``greenhouse gases'' blamed for an increase inthe Earth's temperatures.   Although environmental policy was not scheduled for summitdiscussion until this afternoon, the French and German leaderspointedly addressed it in their opening presentations on Monday.   And East European environmentalists appealed to the summitleaders at a news conference to help their countries clean up.   ``In the past, money was pumped into the government withouteconomic or environmental concern,'' said Zbigniew Bochniarz, amember of the Polish Ecology Club. ``Now we must create a newapproach and build conditions that will modernize outdatedpollution standards.''   Kohl said in his opening session pitch that ``decisive measuresare needed to reduce the greenhouse effect,'' a term referring tothe gradually warming climates around the world.   ``A lack of scientific knowledge about the causes and effectcannot justify slowing down the taking of concrete measures,'' Kohltold his colleagues at the summit.   The statement was clearly aimed at Bush, who contends that morestudy is needed on global warming before taking dramatic stepsurged by Germany and other Europeans to cut the carbon dioxideemissions from burning of fossil fuels, said to be the principalcause of global warming.   Kohl said, however, that ``what is foremost required is drasticreduction of carbon dioxide emissions ...''   The Houston summit should give ``a clear and concrete signal forthe effective protection of mankind and environment,'' Kohl said.   French President Francois Mitterrand joined Kohl in calling forspecific steps, according to his spokesman Hubert Vedrine.   Mitterrand said the summit leaders should not be satisfied withsimply a general declaration on the environment. ``There should bespecific commitments to reduce pollution and save forests,'' thespokesman quoted Mitterrand as saying.   Earlier, Sununu was asked about an environmental group'sscorecard which rated West Germany much higher than the UnitedStates regarding steps to protect the environment. Sununu repliedthat ``West Germany got a lot of good grades for rhetoric.''   ``If you take a good look at what the United States has actuallydone in terms of cleaning up our environment ... I don't think theUnited States has to take a back seat to anyone,'' he said.   Sununu and others in the administration contend that committingto carbon dioxide reduction goals would devastate the U.S. economybecause of the heavy dependence on fossil fuels.   He told a news conference that the administration is concernedthat specific reduction targets amount to a ``perpetualstabilization,'' and that ``continued economic growth ... requiresthat you continue to use energy, and that any growth at all thenwould not be permitted.''   The Germans have led the way in Europe by pledging to cut carbondioxide releases by 25 percent by the year 2005.</TEXT></DOC>
