The disease is known to affect plants and plantparts, including fruit, of citrus and citrus relatives (Family Rutaceae).It can cause defoliation and other serious damage to the leaves and twigsof susceptible plants. It may also make the fruit of infected plants unmarketableby causing lesions on the fruit. Infected fruit may also drop from treesbefore reaching maturity. Aggressive strains of <T3>Xanthomonas campestris </T3>pv. <T3>citri </T3>can infect susceptible plants rapidly and lead to extensiveeconomic losses in commercial citrus-producing areas. Citrus canker is found in the United States only in Florida. To preventthe interstate spread of this disease, we regulate the interstate movementof potential host material from Florida. The regulations are containedin 7 CFR 301.75 and are referred to below as ``the regulations.'' Since October 21, 1988, we have published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> three documents that changed, or proposed tochange, the regulations. This final rule affirms or adopts provisions inall three documents, with modifications based on comments we received.The specific documents, all modifications, and the comments upon whichour final actions are based are discussed below. <ITAG tagnum="84">Federal Register Documents That Form the Basis of This Final Rule</ITAG>On October 21, 1988, we published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> [53 FR 41538-41549, Docket 88-105] a proposalto make various changes to the regulations. (An error in the proposed fruittreatment requirements was corrected by a document published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on November 9, 1988 [53 FR 45274, Docket 88-174].)We propose to: (1) Relieve some restrictions on the interstate movement of regulated fruitproduced in groves outside the area of Florida under special restrictionbecause of citrus canker caused by the Asiatic strains; (2) Allow calamondin and kumquat plants grown from seeds or rooted cuttingsin nurseries or groves outside the area of Florida under special restrictionbecause of citrus canker caused by the Asiatic strains to be moved interstateunder less stringent conditions than at present and to all areas of theUnited States except commercial citrus-producing areas; (3) Prohibit the interstate movement from Florida of budded or graftedcalamondin and kumquat plants, which may have been grown from rootstocksof plants susceptible to and capable of transmitting citrus canker; (4) Add the species <T3>Clausena lansium</T3> (Lour.) Skeels (common name, wampi) to the listof articles regulated because of citrus canker; and (5) Reduce the area of Florida that is under special restriction becauseof citrus canker caused by the Asiatic strains. We invited public comment on the proposed rule. The initial comment periodwas for 30 days following publication of the proposed rule, with commentsto be postmarked or received on or before November 21, 1988. This commentperiod was reopened and extended by a document published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on December 12, 1988 [53 FR 49885, Docket 88-197]to allow consideration of additional comments if they were postmarked orreceived on or before December 27, 1988. We received 32 comments from individual growers, nursery owners, growerand packing associations, other representatives of the citrus industry,and state government officials in Arizona, California, Florida, Louisiana,and Texas. Twenty-two supported the proposed rule; 10 were opposed. On November 8, 1988, during the comment period for Docket 88-105, we publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> [53 FR 45071-45073, Docket 88-180] an interimrule that changed the requirements concerning nursery inspections. Until that interim rule, certificates could be issued for the interstatemovement of regulated fruit only if all nurseries in the state that containedregulated plants were inspected for citrus canker every 30 days. The interimrule allowed certificates to continue to be issued for the interstate movementof regulated fruit, even if all nurseries in Florida were not inspected,provided the State of Florida prohibited the movement of regulated articlesfrom any nursery not inspected. The interim rule was effective November 2, 1988. We solicited public commenton this action, with deadlines for comments the same as for Docket 88-105.We received 7 comments from state government officials in California, FLorida,Louisiana, and Texas, and from representatives of the citrus industry.Two were in favor; 5 opposed the rule. On January 4, 1989, we published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> [54 FR 97-98, Docket 88-212] an interim rulethat required tree-by-tree inspection of certain groves producing fruitfor interstate movement with a certificate. Groves affected were thosethat may have been exposed to the Asiatic strain of citrus canker by personnel,vehicles, or equipment that were previously in a grove infested with theAsiatic strain of citrus canker. The interim rule was effective December 29, 1988. We invited public commenton this action for 30 days, with comments to be received on or before February3, 1989. We received 5 comments from state government officials in Californiaand Texas and from representatives of the citrus industry. All assertedthe rule did not go for enough in providing protection to citrus-producingstates. <ITAG tagnum="84">Comments and Modifications </ITAG>Grove Surveys A number of commenters criticized the proposed grove inspection proceduresas being inadequate to detect citrus canker. Comments on the interim rule,published January 4, 1989, that strengthened survey procedures for certain``exposed'' groves also were critical: although commenters apparently feltthat a tree-by-tree inspection of these groves was a step in the rightdirection, they stated that our survey procedures continued to provideinsufficient protection against the spread of citrus canker to citrus-producingstates. Specific suggestions for improving these procedures included conductinginspections on foot, with a systematic staggering of middles; inspectingall groves tree by tree; inspecting a heavier sampling of trees that mayhave been exposed to the Asiatic strains by ``common harvesting''; and,for groves producing fruit for interstate movement to citrus-producingstates, conducting the last inspection no more than 30 days before harvest.Some commenters also maintained that inspectors should be better trainedand monitored. Several commenters, citing the detection of citrus cankercaused by the Asiatic strains in a Manatee County grove (the Cemetery Block)in November, 1988, asked that all shipments of regulated fruit to citrus-producingstates be halted until the full extent of any spread of the Asiatic strainsfrom that grove has been determined and all groves producing fruit forcertificate have been reinspected on a tree-by-tree basis. Following the detection of citrus canker in the Cemetery Block in November,we took a number of steps to determine the extent of spread of the disease,if any, and to prevent the disease from being spread interstate. First,in the infested grove itself, more than 90 percent of the infested trees(those located in the area of the grove where the infestation was concentrated)were destroyed, and other infested trees, as well as surrounding trees,were defoliated. Within a mile-and-a-half of the infested grove, surveyteams supplemented by personnel employed by the Animal and Plant HealthInspection Service (APHIS) conducted two inspections of all groves andresidential properties, tree by tree and on foot. No fruit moved interstatefrom this area until the surveys were completed and all suspicious sampleswere confirmed negative for citrus canker. Beyond this area and up to 5miles from the infested grove, the survey crews also inspected every residentialproperty tree by tree, and inspected all groves by walking every fourthmiddle. No additional infestations were found. We also identified all groves that may have been exposed to citrus cankerby the movement of personnel, vehicles, and equipment from the infestedgrove during the 2 years prior to the detection. Survey crews supplementedby APHIS personnel inspected each of these groves, tree by tree. Again,no infestations were found. In addition, scientists employed by the U.S. Department of Agricultureand the University of Florida looked at the potential for natural spreadof the disease as a result of Tropical Storm Keith, which moved eastwardover Florida from the Gulf Coast in late November, 1988. They determined,based upon these surveys and experience with the spread of the diseasein other places, that viable bacteria from the infested grove could havespread only a short distance, and not beyond the area already under specialrestrictions because of the Asiatic strains (the A-strains area). Further,there is a sufficient buffer between the area where the bacteria couldhave spread and the boundaries of the A-strain area. Any bacteria thatmay have been spread by the storm are unlikely to infect any citrus plantson which they may have been deposited at least until spring weather producesa flush of new growth on the trees. Fruit on the trees when the storm hitwas not at risk of becoming infested, since it was beyond the susceptiblestage of development, and our regulations require that this fruit be treatedto destroy surface bacteria. Based on our surveys, and other information cited above, it does not appearthat additional infestations are present at this time. Consequently, allfruit that has qualified for a certificate or limited permit based on grovesurveys completed in accordance with regulations in effect before thisfinal rule may be moved interstate without further grove surveys. However,we agree with commenters that survey procedures must be strengthened toensure prompt detection should any grove become infested in the future.Therefore, this final rule establishes new grove survey procedures, effectiveimmediately, for all groves where surveys to qualify fruit for interstatemovement with a certificate or limited permit have not yet been completed.The new grove survey requirements are as follows: In all groves producing regulated fruit for interstate movement with acertificate: No more than 30 days before the beginning of harvest, an inspectormust walk through the grove and inspect every tree; and, in groves producinglimes, an inspector must repeat the tree-by-tree walking survey at no morethan 120-day intervals for as long as the harvest continues. In all groves producing regulated fruit for interstate movement with alimited permit and located within the area of Florida under special restrictionbecause of citrus canker caused by the Asiatic strains (the A-strain area):No more than 30 days before the beginning of harvest, an inspector mustwalk through the grove and inspect every tree; and, in groves producinglimes, an inspector must repeat the tree-by-tree walking survey at no morethan 120-day intervals for as long as the harvest continues. In all groves of 10 or more trees producing regulated fruit for interstatemovement with a limited permit and located outside the A-strain area: Nomore than 90 days before the beginning of harvest, an inspector must examineall trees on the perimeter of the grove while driving by at no more than2 m.p.h.; examine, while on foot, at least 12 trees in high-risk areasof the grove (such as the grove entrance, the perimeter of the grove, andareas where the movement of people and equipment is concentrated); andexamine, while on foot, a minimum of four mature trees or eight young treesin one location in every 10 acres of the grove, or, for groves less than10 acres, examine, while on foot, a minimum of four mature trees or eightyoung trees in one location. Also, in groves producing limes, as inspectormust repeat this survey at no more than 120-day intervals for as long asthe harvest continues. In all groves of fewer than 10 trees producing regulated fruit for interstatemovement with a limited permit and located outside the A-strain area: Nomore than 30 days before the beginning of harvest, an inspector must walkthrough the grove and inspect every tree; and, in groves producing limes,an inspector must repeat the tree-by-tree walking survey at no more than120-day intervals for as long as the harvest continues. Conducting surveys closer to harvest, on foot, and tree-by-tree in groveslocated within the A-strain area and in groves producing fruit for interstatemovement with a certificate will significantly strengthen our detectionprogram for citrus canker. The additional surveys required for lime grovesthat have extended harvests also will help ensure prompt detection of citruscanker should any lime grove become infested. Unlike other citrus trees,lime trees are susceptible to infection with citrus canker throughout theyear because blooms and flushes occur on lime trees year-round.<ITAG tagnum="21">Note: Because our final rule requires a tree-by-tree survey, on foot,of all groves producing fruit for interstate movement with a certificate,similar survey requirements established by the interim rule of January4, 1989, for exposed groves only are not longer necessary. Therefore, weare not affirming the survey requirements and the related definition of``exposed'' set forth in that interim rule.</ITAG>Treatment of Personnel, Vehicles, and EquipmentIn response to concerns about measures taken in Florida to control anderadicate citrus canker, this final rule also requires treatment of personnel,vehicles, and equipment upon leaving, as well as entering, any grove of10 or more trees located within the A-strain area. This action will provideadditional protection against the interstate spread of citrus canker.A-Strain AreaWe received a number of comments, both pro and con, concerning our proposedchanges to the boundaries of the A-strain area. Some of these were mailedto us before citrus canker was found in the Cemetery Block in November;some were mailed later. Based on these comments, and on surveys that havebeen completed, we have determined that some modification of our proposalis necessary. This final rule retains the proposed changes for Pinellasand Sarasota counties but not for Manatee or Hillsborough counties. Beforethe effective date of this final rule, all of Manatee County, and HillsboroughCounty south of State Road 60 were included in the A-strain area. We proposedto remove Hillsborough County entirely and to remove the eastern portionof Manatee County. However, after reviewing the comments and consideringall data relevant to Cemetery Block infestation, we have determined thatthese proposed changes in the A-strain area would bring the boundary ofthat area too close to the site of the recent infestation. Our final rule,therefore, keeps all of Manatee County in the A-strain area, as well asHillsborough County south of State Highway 672 and west of State Highway39. The boundaries for the A-strain area are based on the following considerations:The size and nature of citrus canker infestations; the distance the bacteriamight naturally move from the sites of the infestations; and the proximityof citrus groves and contiguous, residential properties on which citrusis grown and through which citrus canker could be spread by people, vehicles,and equipment, including lawn services, moving from one property to another.Fruit TreatmentWe received one comment objecting to the proposed use of soap (or detergent)and water to treat fruit produced in groves of 10 or more trees locatedoutside the A-strain area. These groves, first of all, are very unlikelyto be infested with citrus canker. The survey(s) required by our regulationsfurther ensure that fruit produced in these groves is not infested withcitrus canker. Our requirement that the fruit be treated is yet anotherof the multiple safeguards contained in our regulations to prevent theinterstate spread of citrus canker. The fruit treatment reduces the risk,already very low, that the fruit could spread citrus canker interstateby means of undetectable levels of bacteria on the surface of the fruit.As stated in the proposal, treatment with soap (or detergent) and wateris effective in reducing the number of surface bacteria. Furthermore, fruiteligible for this treatment may not be moved interstate to areas wherehost material is available to support an infestation of citrus canker (commercialcitrus-producing areas). Therefore, we have determined that eligible fruittreated with soap (or detergent) and water as prescribed would presenta very remote risk of spreading citrus canker interstate, and we have madeno change to the proposal based on this comment.Relaxation of Requirements Related to Nursery StrainSeveral commenters objected to our proposed relaxation of restrictionsrelated to the Florida nursery strains. They maintained that there hasbeen insufficient time to verify the adequacy of safeguards and that additionalresearch is necessary to support the contention that the Florida nurserystrains are not a serious threat to mature trees and citrus fruit.We agree that research into the Florida nursery strains should continue.However, as stated in previous rulemaking documents, there is still noevidence, more than four-and-a-half years after the Florida nursery strainswere first detected in Florida, that these stains will infest and damagemature trees or fruit in commercial groves. Moreover, as research continuesand additional data is obtained from field observations, there is a growingbody of evidence indicating that this scenario is very unlikely to occur.We have, therefore, made no change to the proposed rule based on thesecomments.Nursery InspectionsWe received a number of comments asking us to reduce the frequency of nurseryinspections. The commenters maintained that inspection of nurseries every30 days was unnecessary, put servere strains on the resources of the state,which provides inspectors, and was a serious inconvenience to nursery owners.Another commenter maintained that some nurseries should not have to beinspected.We have made two changes in response to these comments. This final rulerequires nursery inspections approximately every 45 days, rather than every30 days, and not all nurseries will have to be inspected. Nurseries whereregulated plants are grown for use only in a grove maintained by the nurseryowner will be exempt from the inspection requirements, provided that fruitproduced in the grove is processed within the State of Florida into a productother than fresh fruit. This includes, among other things, fruit processedinto juice, fruit salad, cattle feed, candied fruit, and concentrate. Aninfestation in these nurseries would not increase the risk of citrus cankerbeing spread interstate. Inspection of nurseries every 45 days, ratherthan every 30 days, will still be frequent enough for inspectors to findcitrus canker while innoculum levels are low if a nursery is infested.Several commenters objected to our interim rule that allowed certificatesto be issued for the interstate movement of fruit, even if all nurseriesin Florida are not inspected, provided that the State of Florida prohibitsthe movement of all regulated articles from the uninspected nurseries.Commenters maintained that uninspected nurseries could become infestedwithout our knowing it and that innoculum levels could reach levels highenough to present a threat of spreading citrus canker to adjacent properties.Commenters also expressed concern about plants that may have been movedpreviously from these uninspected, and possibly infested, nurseries, intogroves.Only one nursery in Florida has refused inspection and, subsequently, beenplaced under state quarantine as described above. We are monitoring thissituation for any potential risk of spreading citrus canker interstate,and have determined that this risk is negligible. We will reevaluate ourrequirements concerning nursery inspections if we determine that the diseaserisk presented by this nursery has increased or if the number of nurseriesrefusing inspection increases the risk of citrus canker spreading interstate.In the present circumstances, however, we believe the provision allowingstate quarantine of uninspected nurseries is adequate to prevent the interstatespread of citrus canker, and we have made no changes to the regulationsbased on these comments.Dooryard FruitSeveral commenters were concerned about requirements pertaining to fruitproduced in groves of fewer than 10 trees (dooryard fruit). One commentercomplained that she could not sell fruit from her home. Our regulationsrelate only to the interstate movement of regulated fruit and do not prohibitintrastate sale or movement. Another commenter wanted to be able to shipfruit that had been inspected and found free of citrus canker to friendsand relatives in noncitrus-producing states. Our regulations do allow thisinterstate movement, if the grove has not contained any infested plantsor plant parts, within the past year, if all exposed plants at high riskfor developing citrus canker have been destroyed, and if the grove is notwithin one-half mile of any property where there has been a primary infestationof citrus canker caused by the Asiatic strains within the past 2 years.Fruit grown in the A-strain area also must be treated. Other commentersobjected to the cost and inconvenience of having their fruit treated. Werecognize this problem, and our final rule eases this burden somewhat byeliminating the treatment requirement for dooryard fruit produced outsidethe A-strain area, and, in cases where treatment is required, allowingthe fruit to be treated at any location if treatment is applied in thepresence of an inspector.MiscellaneousOne commenter maintained that we should prohibit interstate movement ofregulated fruit into the Lower Rio Grande Valley in Texas, because grapefruitgrown in this area is particularly susceptible to citrus canker. We believethat fruit moved interstate with a certificate in accordance with thisrule will present an extremely small risk of carrying citrus canker bacteria,and that the risk of this fruit spreading citrus canker into the LowerRio Grande Valley or other commercial citrus-producing areas is remote.Therefore, we have made no changes based on this comment.In addition, we have made minor, editorial changes to clarify the regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Effective Date</ITAG>Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553, we find good cause for makingthis rule effective less than 30 days after publication in the <T4>Federal Register. </T4>This rule establishes requirements necessaryto prevent the interstate spread of citrus canker and removes restrictionsthat are not necessary for achieving this goal. Because the shipping seasonfor Florida citrus is under way, immediate implementation of this ruleis necessary to provide maximum protection against the interstate spreadof citrus canker and to provide relief to those persons who are adverselyaffected by restrictions we no longer find warranted. Therefore, the Administratorof the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that thisrule should be effective upon publication in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4><ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 and Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>We are issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12291, andwe have determined that it is not a ``major rule.'' Based on informationcompiled by the Department, we have determined that this rule will havean effect on the economy of less than $100 million; will not cause a majorincrease in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, federal,state or local government agencies, or geographic regions; and will notcause a significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.Regulated FruitMore regulated fruit is eligible for interstate movement to commercialcitrus-producing areas of the United States as a result of the followingchanges made by this rule: (1) Groves producing fruit for interstate movementwith a certificate no longer have to be at least one-half mile from propertiesthat contained, during the past 2 years, plants or plant parts infestedwith or exposed to the Florida nursery strains; (2) within one-half to5 miles of these groves, the presence of plants infested with or at highrisk of developing the form of citrus canker caused by the Florida nurserystrains no longer disqualifies the fruit for interstate movement with acertificate; and (3) the area of Florida designated as being under specialrestriction because of citrus canker caused by the Asiatic strains (theA-strain area) has been reduced. As a result, we estimate that all butabout 20,000 of Florida's 600,000 acres of fruit-bearing citrus trees willproduce fruit eligible for interstate movement with a certificate, an increaseof about 6 percent over the 1987-1988 shipping season. However, only arelatively small amount of the regulated fruit produced on these acreswill be moved interstate to commercial citrus-producing areas. Most regulatedfruit grown in Florida is used to make juice at processing plants in thestate. Less than 20 percent is consumed as fresh fruit, and much of thisis consumed in the state or is exported to foreign countries. Figures fromthe State of Florida Department of Citrus show that in 1983-1984, the lastcomplete season before Florida was quarantined for citrus canker, the amountof fresh fruit shipped to commercial citrus-producing areas of the UnitedStates was 4.3 percent of the fresh citrus fruit shipped to all statescombined, or about 3 million \4/5\ bushel cartons. Furthermore, most ofthe regulated fruit eligible for interstate movement with a certificateunder this rule was already eligible for interstate movement with a limitedpermit.This rule also establishes several changes in survey requirements for groves.Only one survey will be required for most groves producing regulated fruitfor interstate movement, but inspectors will have to conduct the surveyson foot and look at every tree. In addition, some grove surveys will haveto be conducted closer to the time harvest begins. Also, groves and otherproperties within 5 miles of groves producing fruit for interstate movementwith a certificate will no longer have to be surveyed. Although requiringtree-by-tree surveys close to the time of harvest will increase the manpowerrequired for grove surveys at certain times of the year, the number ofsurveys required will be significantly reduced, resulting in an overallreduction in activities of state and federal offices responsible for conductingthe surveys. The changes in survey requirements will have very little,if any, economic impact on persons involved in growing, handling, or shippingregulated fruit interstate, or on the amount of regulated fruit moved interstate.Our rule requires nursery inspections approximately every 45 days, ratherthan every 30 days, and exempts certain nurseries from inspection. Nurserieswhere regulated plants are grown for use only in a grove maintained bythe nursery owner will not have to be inspected if fruit produced in thegrove is processed within the State of Florida into a product other thanfresh fruit. These changes will reduce demands on the State of Florida,which provides inspectors, and will reduce, and in some cases eliminate,an inconvenience to nursery owners and operators. Since there is no chargeto nursery owners for these inspections, however, these changes shouldhave no economic impact on them.Our rule removes the requirement that personnel, vehicles, and equipmentbe treated upon entering a grove producing fruit for interstate movementwith a certificate. However, we have added a requirement that personnel,vehicles, and equipment be treated upon entering and leaving any groveof 10 or more regulated trees located within the A-strain area. These actionsaffect production expenses for those grove owners. However, the cost ofdisinfecting personnel, vehicles, and equipment is minor when comparedto overall production expenses, and adding or removing this requirementshould have little economic impact on persons producing fruit for interstatemovement.Our rule requires that groves of 10 or more regulated trees producing fruitfor interstate movement with a limited permit obtain regulated plants duringthe year before the interstate movement only from nurseries inspected andfound free of citrus canker. This change would have little economic impacton persons moving regulated fruit interstate with a limited permit sinceall citrus nurseries in the State of Florida are already being surveyedregularly for citrus canker, and Florida regulations restrict the intrastatemovement of plants from infested nurseries.We are prohibiting the interstate movement of regulated fruit from anygrove that is within one-half mile of any property where a primary infestationcaused by the Asiatic strains has occurred within the past 2 years. Thisprovision currently applies only to groves adjacent to two commercial groves(both in Manatee County) and approximately 24,000 residential propertiesin this area. However, no fruit is being moved from these properties nowbecause the State of Florida already prohibits the intrastate movementof fruit from these properties. Therefore, our proposal would have no economicimpact on persons moving regulated fruit interstate.We are allowing a soap (or detergent) and water treatment for fruit producedin groves of 10 or more regulated trees located outside the A-strain areaif the fruit is to be moved interstate with a limited permit. Washing citrusfruit with soap (or detergent) and water is standard practice in packinghouses. Eliminating the need for chemical treatment with chlorine or SOPPwill reduce the cost of processing this fruit. However, expenses associatedwith fruit treatment are not a significant deterrent to the interstatemovement of regulated fruit produced in commercial groves. Therefore, wedo not anticipate that the change in this requirement will have any significanteconomic impact on persons moving regulated fruit interstate with a limitedpermit.When fruit must be treated as a condition of interstate movement, we arerequiring that treatments be applied either in the presence of an inspectoror at a facility owned by a person operating under a compliance agreement.This action will not pose any additional economic burden on persons movingregulated fruit interstate since all fruit treatments now are applied atfacilities operating under compliance agreements.We are allowing certain regulated fruit to be moved interstate withouttreatment to parts of the United States that are not commercial citrus-producingareas. This provision applies only to regulated fruit produced in grovesof fewer than 10 trees located outside the A-strain area. This action willreduce the cost to many individuals of moving regulated fruit interstatewith a limited permit. We anticipate that more individuals will move regulatedfruit interstate as gifts to friends or relatives if treatment is not required.Other individuals and businesses will not be affected, however, since regulatedfruit from groves of fewer than 10 trees may be moved interstate only ifit is sent directly to a household for consumption. Also, the amount ofregulated fruit that may be shipped interstate in this manner will continueto be extremely small when compared to the amount of regulated fruit shippedinterstate in commercial channels. Our final rule allows the interstate movement of regulated seed only fromnurseries or groves that have not contained plants or plant parts exposedto or infested with citrus canker for at least 2 years. This action willhave very little economic impact on persons moving regulated seed interstatesince an insignificant amount of this seed is produced in Florida for interstatemovement. Furthermore, most of that is obtained from groves, which have,with few exceptions, been free of citrus canker.WampiWe are adding the species <T3>Clausena lansium</T3> (Lour.) Skeels (common name, wampi) to the listof regulated articles. This action will have little or no economic impacton persons who move regulated articles interstate since very little wampiis grown in Florida, and at this time, we are not aware of any wampi fruitor plants being moved interstate.Calamondin and Kumquat PlantsWe are reducing restrictions on the interstate movement of own-root-onlycalamondin and kumquat plants grown outside the A-strain area. Also, weare prohibiting the interstate movement of grafted or budded calamondinand kumquat plants and all calamondin and kumquat plants grown within theA-strain area.We are not aware of any nurseries that grow calamondin and kumquat plantsin the A-strain area.Approximately six nurseries produce container-grown calamondin or kumquatplants, nearly all of which are own-root-only. These plants are seasonal,specialty commodities sold as decorative house plants and for use as indoorlandscaping at shopping malls, office buildings, and other establishments.Although we expect sales of the container-grown plants to increase as aresult of this final rule, we do not expect the increased sales to havea significant economic impact on nuseries or other businesses involvedin the sale of these plants. This is because calamondin and kumquat plantsaccount for only a small percentage of these businesses' activities.Individually packaged calamondin plants are own-root-only plants. Theyare sold at many gift shops and roadside fruit stands as decorative indoorhouse plants. Primary purchasers are tourists buying souvenirs before returninghome from the quarantined area. The overwhelming majority of gift shopsand roadside stands selling individually packaged clamondin plants aresmall entities.
