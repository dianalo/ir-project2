Graphitecore is the stiffest nonmetallic honeycomb ever produced. Its shear modulivalues exceed those of aluminum core at comparable densities. Its thermalstability and elevated temperature properties are excellent. Currently,graphite honeycomb (designated HFT-G) is in the process of being scaledup from R and D laboratory production to production at Hexcel's Grahammanufacturing plant. HFT-G is produced from 1 K tow style 6151 fabricwith a phenolic impregnation and dip resin. Future product modificationswill be made using different tows and resin systems.</TEXT></DOC>
