Considerableresearch and development has been carried out on nuclear methods fordetermination of ash in coal. A number of nuclear techniques are nowwell established for coal analysis. In particular, the spectrometricgamma-gamma technique is based on the existence of a simple correlationbetween the ash content and the equivalent atomic number of coal. Thistechnique records and uses the count rates of the backscatter spectrum.These count rates describe the changes in spectral shape which are dueto ash content variations. This method is presented along with a shortreview of the physical background. The report includes the simulationof in situ borehole probe readings using a MONTE CARLO tracking program.Simulating the transport through matter of gamma-rays by MONTE CARLOtechniques essentially attempts to reproduce the actual statistical natureof the interaction processes. Random numbers are used throughout, alongwith known nuclear data, to select the parameters which influence a particle'shistory. Such an approach can deal with complex geometries through whichthe particles move. Biaising or weightening techniques are applied forvariance reduction, so as to minimise the statistical errors. The basicfeatures of biaising as well as the description of the program are given.A semi-theoretical approach is discussed for the determination of ashcontent of coal seam using the simulated spectrum.</TEXT></DOC>
