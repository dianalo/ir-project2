RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The U.S. government is entitled to some of themoney American companies are awarded by an international tribunalcreated as part of the settlement of the 1981 Iran hostage crisis,a unanimous Supreme Court ruled Tuesday.   The justices said the companies' rights are not violated byrequiring them _ rather than all U.S. taxpayers _ to help defraythe costs of the claims settlement process.   The court upheld a 1985 law that allows the U.S. government todeduct 1.5 percent of the first $5 million recovered by any companyand 1 percent of anything exceeding that amount.   Justice Byron R. White, writing for the court, said thedeductions are reasonable even if they do not equal the amount ofmoney the government expended to help the companies win theirclaims.   ``This court has never held that the amount of a user fee mustbe precisely calibrated to the use that a party makes of governmentservices,'' he said. ``Nor does the government need to recordinvoices and billable hours to justify the costs of its services.''   White rejected arguments by Sperry Corp. that forcing companiesto pay the fees is an unconstitutional confiscation of theirproperty and that any costs to the government should be borne bythe nation as a whole.   ``As we see it, Sperry has not identified any of its propertythat was taken without just compensation,'' he said.   The Bush administration said tens of millions of dollars were atstake, including some $12.7 million already deducted by the U.S.government from claims paid to companies.   The financial deal that freed the 52 American hostages from Iranin 1981 included the U.S. government's release of billions ofdollars in frozen Iranian assets and creation of an internationaltribunal to resolve claims against Iran.   The Supreme Court in 1981 upheld the power of former PresidentCarter to approve the settlement, and that was not at issue inTuesday's ruling.   Sperry Corp., which leased computer systems to Iran before the1979 hostage crisis severed relations between the United States andthat country, was awarded $2.8 million by the international claimstribunal.   The U.S. government deducted $42,000 for its expenses in helpingSperry.   Tuesday's decision overturned a federal appeals court rulinglast year that the deduction was an unconstitutional seizure ofprivate property.   The high court ruling is not related directly to recentdevelopments suggesting eased tensions between Iran and the UnitedStates.   The Bush administration announced three weeks ago that theUnited States is returning $567 million in frozen assets to Iran, amove President Bush said he hopes will prompt Tehran to push forfreedom for American hostages in Lebanon.   The $567 million was being held in a fund to back up claims byAmerican banks against Iran.   In another case, the high court ruled, 9-0, that a federal lawaimed primarily at compensating injured dockworkers also applies torailroad employees who clean and repair dockside loading equipment.   It ruled that three injured railroad workers from Virginia arelimited to receiving benefits under the Longshoremen's and HarborWorkers' Compensation Act. They had sought potentially greatercompensation under a disability law covering the railroad industry,the Federal Employers' Liability Act.</TEXT></DOC>
