PICO and its Professionals Insurance Co. unit will cease writing automobile, homeowners and other personal property and casualty insurance. In addition, the company's financial planning subsidiary, SMB Financial Planning Inc., has been purchased by the principals of that unit and a reinsurance brokerage affiliate, American Intermediaries, is being purchased by company managers.    Robert L. Dion, president and chief executive officer of Physicians Insurance, said withdrawal from these businesses will have &quot;a short term, negative impact on consolidated operating results.&quot; In 1987, the company reported a net loss of $2.8 million.    Personal property and casualty premium volume for the company was $12 million, about 18% of its total premium volume of $70 million. Revenue from financial planning and reinsurance brokerage activities didn't contribute materially to total revenue, the company said. </TEXT></DOC>
