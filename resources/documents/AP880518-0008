A communique issued simultaneously in Rabat and Algiers onMonday announced the decision to re-establish full diplomaticrelations immediately and to reactivate all past agreements,including a 19-year-old treaty of friendship and cooperation.   Transport and communications links between the two countries areto be restored without delay.   The communique stressed the determination of the two NorthAfrican Arab neighbors to cooperate toward ``Maghreb,'' or NorthAfrican, unity and toward solving all bilateral and regionalproblems including the dispute over the Western Sahara which hasrepeatedly brought them to the brink of war.   The announcement followed months of secret high-level diplomaticcontacts between the two governments and strong pressure from otherArab countries to put an end to their dispute.   The joint communique said nothing about the concessions believedto have been made by the two sides concerning the Western Sahara _the root of their quarrel.   Morocco annexed Western Sahara, a former Spanish colony, in1975. It was Algeria's military, financial, logistic and diplomaticsupport for a guerrilla group in the territory, the PolisarioFront, that led to the break in relations in March 1976.   Hours before the communique was issued, Polisario's Algiersheadquarters claimed the guerrillas had launched an attack onMoroccan troops in the desert and killed 20 of them. Moroccorefused to confirm or deny the report.   In its first comment on the reconciliation, the Polisario Frontsaid it was ``determined to pursue its legitimate struggle for theconquest of sovereignty over all its national territory.''   The statement said the guerrilla group approved any move towardlessening tension and creating the ``greater Maghreb'' but added:   ``The only just and definitive solution is the recognition ofthe national rights of the Saharan state.''   Algeria had hitherto insisted that relations could only berestored between the two governments after Morocco agreed to opendirect talks with the Polisario leadership.   But King Hassan consistently rejected such talks on the groundsthat this would prejudge the result of a proposed referendum in thedisputed territory.   Polisario, for its part, has insisted the 160,000 Moroccantroops and administrators be replaced by an internationalpeacekeeping force prior to any vote.   Tuesday marked the third day of a major feast ending the Moslemholy month of Ramadan, and most senior officials were unreachablein both countries.   The Moroccan government paper, Le Matin du Sahara, sought todispel speculation that Algeria agreed to resume relations only toensure the participation of King Hassan II of Morocco in the Arabsummit meeting scheduled to begin June 7 in Algiers.   King Hassan said earlier he would not attend the summit whileMorocco had no diplomatic relations with Algeria.   ``The resumption of diplomatic relations is far from a simplearrangement of convenience on the eve of an Arab summit,'' thepaper said. ``The creation of a greater Maghreb ... is a vitalnecessity for the Arab and African peoples.''   Arab League Secretary General Chedli Klibi hailed thereconciliation Tuesday and said that ``in the immediate yourdecision will have a positive effect'' on the summit.   In Washington, the State Department hailed the reneweddiplomatic links.   ``It's a positive step for both countries and for the NorthAfrica region,'' said State Department spokesman Charles Redman.   The restoration of relations between Algeria and Morocco removedthe greatest obstacle preventing further North African unity,however, and the joint communique said this was the objective ofboth governments.   Algeria is linked in a regional friendship and cooperationtreaty to Tunisia and Mauritania. Each of the three countries has aveto over the possible extension of the treaty, and Tunisia haslong blocked Algerian efforts to include Libya because such actionwould leave Morocco isolated in North Africa.   Although the joint communique gave no hint of progress toward asolution of the Western Sahara dispute, it seemed to open the wayto the possible five-nation North African community that has longbeen a professed goal of all the governments involved.</TEXT><TEXT>   Michael Goldsmith has reported on North Africa for TheAssociated Press for 20 years.</TEXT></DOC>
