Systematicinvestigations into the performance and first cost of presently availablesystems are followed by a presentation and discussion of the major parametersinfluencing the utilization of automated peak load control systems (load-orientedrates, structure of load curves, extent and composition of potentialinfluences). The table calculation model developed serves to quantifythe systems' economic efficiency. Examples show the model's applicationtogether with typologically assessed determinant constellations. Theindividual results compiled are scrutinized for their value. (orig.)With 23 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
