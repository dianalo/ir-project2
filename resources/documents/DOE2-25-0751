It is found that the average radius of confinement region withinserted magnetic surfaces is 8.5+-0.5 cm and somewhat changes with thealteration of vertical magnetic field. Inserted magnetic surfaces aresurrounded by an ergodic magnetic field with the average width of 3.5+-0.5cm where magnetic force lines trace 1-10 times around torus. The structureof diverted magnetic field is close to calculated value. The differenceof ideal and actual configuration observed is evidently the consequenceof nonprecise preparation of device magnetic system. 10 refs.; 10 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
