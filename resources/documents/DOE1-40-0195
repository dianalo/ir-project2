Data obtained from experiments performed by othershave been employed for this comparison. For low Reynolds number particlesin air it is observed that the magnitude of the drag is on the orderof 10 to 1000 times greater than each of the other contributing forces.For low Reynolds number particles in water the pressure gradient termbecomes dominant by an order of magnitude over the other forces, andfor intermediate Reynolds number particles, although the drag term increases,the pressure gradient term still exceeds all other forces. For high Reynoldsnumber cases in water, the drag term is larger than all other terms bya factor of 10 to 50. The comparison indicates that in some cases itmay be possible to neglect certain terms that make analytical solutionof the problem quite untractable.</TEXT></DOC>
