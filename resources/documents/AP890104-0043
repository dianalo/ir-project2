WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The arrival of a record 242,000immigrants from Eastern Europe _ more than half from Poland _ hasstrained West Germans' hospitality and ability to integrate so manynewcomers.   The Bavarian culture ministry, meanwhile, announced Tuesday thata Russian-language school will open next fall in Pfarrkirchen tohelp assimilate refugee children from the Soviet Union.   Those making up the largest group of immigrants in 1988 _ 140,226_ came from Poland, followed by 47,572 Soviets of German descent and39,832 people from East Germany.   The increase over the previous record of 90,000 in 1987 reflectsa relaxation of emigration policy in the three Soviet bloc countries.   Even more refugees are expected this year, said HorstWaffenschmidt, the Interior Ministry official responsible forrefugees.   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform efforts have easedrestrictions on those seeking to leave the country, and the moretolerant view has been adopted to some degree by authorities inWarsaw and East Berlin.   Politicians and labor union officials concerned about WestGermany's 8 percent jobless rate have been increasingly critical ofthe government's policy of accepting virtually all ethnic Germansseeking to emigrate to the West.   Many of the newcomers speak little or no German and are alreadynear retirement age or have limited job skills.   The East European refugees usually require government-financedhousing, food, language training and other social services formonths after their arrival.   Saarland state governor Oskar Lafontaine of the left-wing SocialDemocratic Party complained in October that the ethnic Germans weregetting priority over people from Third World countries seekingpolitical asylum.   Waffenschmidt, an influential member of Chancellor Helmut Kohl'sChristian Democrat Party, said the Bonn government is committed todoing all it can ``to ease for these countrymen their new start inour land.''   He said $1.1 billion has been earmarked for aiding East Europeanrefugees in 1989.   Christian Democratic spokesman Johannes Gester on Tuesday urgedthe government to create a fourth reception camp for Soviet blocimmigrants to ease crowding at the three facilities currentlyregistering arrivals and provide initial assistance for them.   Thousands of immigrants are camped in crowded barracks and tentcities throughout the federal republic. Local governments strugglewith short funds and a tight housing market to provide suitabledwellings.   Emigration to West Germany from Romania fell by about 1,000 lastyear to 12,902, according to the Interior Ministry figures. Therewere 959 resettlers from Czechoslovakia, 763 from Hungary and 223from Yugoslavia, the government reported.</TEXT></DOC>
