 DOD officials haveidentified seven function areas for consolidation, and three teams have begunwork.andM;&quot;Eventually, we will address all function areas across the department,&quot; saidCynthia Kendall, DOD's deputy comptroller for information resourcesmanagement, who oversees the working groups.andM;The seven categories targeted for integration are civilian payroll,warehousing, civilian personnel, financial management, materiel management,contract payment and medical systems.andP;  In a recent interview, Kendall saidDOD officials may add military payroll and technical manuals to the list offunctions to be integrated.andM;Kendall said DOD has proceeded cautiously &quot;so we can learn from ourexperiences and not make mistakes that will cost us money.&quot;andP;  DOD officialshave said the CIM initiative will save more than $2 billion over five years.andM;Kendall said DOD officials learned a valuable lesson when they formed thefirst two working groups in December.andP;  &quot;We found that we just needed moreexpertise than we'd put together,&quot; she said of the teams examiningrequirements for civilian payroll and warehousing.andM;Each group is comprised of policy, operations and information systems expertsin the function area from each of the services and relevant agencies.andO;However, &quot;because all of these areas are so complex,&quot; Kendall said thepayroll and warehousing teams were given license &quot;to call out to the field tobring in any experts they need.&quot;andM;DOD financial systems recently have come under the scrutiny of Congress andthe General Accounting Office.andP;  One GAO report said the Air Force's system is&quot;unauditable.&quot;andM;&quot;We have to make sure we get people on these groups who are knowledgeablewithin the individual disciplines of the overall function,&quot; Kendall said.andO;&quot;We don't want to be making guesses about these things.&quot;andM;The working groups examine issues as broad as the policies that distinguishan Army system from a Navy, and as narrow as how individual data elements canbe made standard across the department, Kendall said.andM;A key aspect of the CIM effort is implied in the presence of policy andoperations experts on the groups.andM;&quot;One of the reasons we need this kind of knowledge is that they may lookacross the components of the department and find differences in the waythings are done, differences in their policies, that just might bearbitrary,&quot; Kendall said.andM;&quot;It might be that the Army set a policy one way, the Navy another, but thatthere is no legal reason or any restraint on changing the policies.andP;  So,we've got the right people together to make those judgment calls.andP;  To theextent that we can standardize our policies and practices first, developingstandard requirements and, ultimately, a standard system, is going to be mucheasier.&quot;andM;Although consolidating disparate policies might require political wrangling,other standardization decisions simply will require an authority to enforcethem, Kendall said.andM;In one DOD database, for example, the designation &quot;TK&quot; means &quot;tank.&quot;andP;  Inanother, it means &quot;truck.&quot;andP;  The CIM groups often will boil down the problemto a simple axiom: Choose one way of doing it.andM;The IRM experts &quot;are not there to tell functional people how to do theirjobs,&quot; she said.andM;But DOD officials have found that &quot;a person who has experience in developingand maintaining an information system tends to be very knowledgeable in thespecifics of that particular function,&quot; she said.andM;Because many of the working groups will be together for up to two years,observers have suggested that DOD may use the groups to help acquire ordevelop CIM systems.andM;But Kendall said the working groups will disband once requirements arefinalized.andM;&quot;If you want to envision it, the requirements will be turned over to acentral design activity and a decision has to be made as to what makes themost economic sense,&quot; she said.andM;Options range from merging existing systems to &quot;starting over from the groundup,&quot; she said.andM;One drawback of the CIM is that new requirements may deprive users ofcapabilities they have grown accustomed to.andP;  For example, the CIM workinggroup will merge the core fucntion of as many as 27 different civilianpersonnel systems.andP;  Kendall said such an effort likely will result in theelimination of processing features unique among the systems.andM;On the other hand, cost savings and technology associated with open systemsarchitecture could be such that &quot;we first field a system that meets the corerequirements and then add on as we go along,&quot; Kendall said.andP;  But she alsosaid that open systems capabilities most likely will not be available atfirst.andM;&quot;I'd dearly love to have open systems, but I suspect that's a little furtherdown the road than we're going to see for our early systems in corporateinformation management.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
