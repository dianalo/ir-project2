Customers and suppliers of Santa Fe International Corp.,in Alhambra, Calif., initially expressed concern aboutdealing with the Kuwaiti-owned oil drilling company followingIraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, said Vice President JohnMika.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;They wanted assurance that they were not violating anyfreeze order by continuing their relationship with us,&quot; hesaid.   But the Treasury &quot;cooperated quite well with us&quot; ingranting the exemption, which allows the company to continuewriting checks, making payroll and otherwise operatenormally, he said.   At Georgetown Industries Inc., a Kuwaiti-owned steelcompany in Charlotte, N.C., &quot;our business is very muchbusiness as usual,&quot; said President Roger Regelbrugge. &quot;Wehave no other restrictions than that we are not supposed totransfer assets to the government of Kuwait or to Iraq,&quot; hesaid.   Hilton Hotels Corp., whose Atlanta Hotel andamp; Tower is ownedby the Kuwaiti government, also has had no problems, said aspokeswoman.   Estimates of Kuwait's U.S. investments vary from under $10billion to more than $50 billion because of the nation'spolicy of secrecy.   Kuwait's overall foreign assets last year totaled anestimated $124 billion, according to DRI-McGraw-Hill Inc.Much of that is in Europe, and includes such high-profileinvestments as a 14% stake in Daimler-Benz AG, the Germanauto, electronics and aerospace giant.   Santa Fe International, which state-owned Kuwait PetroleumCorp. bought for $2.5 billion in 1981, is believed to be theMideast nation's largest single U.S. holding.   Other known Kuwaiti government assets in the U.S.,according to the New York-based newsletter MidEast Report andother sources, include:   -- Occidental Geothermal Inc. of Los Angeles, which KuwaitPetroleum bought for $350 million in 1984.   -- About 12% of Corporate Property Investors, which ownsreal estate in New York as well as a number of shopping mallsnationwide.   -- An undetermined stake in First American BanksharesInc., a bank-holding company in Washington.   -- 45% of the Phoenecian resort in Scottsdale, Ariz.,which was controlled by scandal-plagued Lincoln Savings andamp;Loan Association until the federal government took overLincoln's share.   -- 45% of the Crescent hotel in Phoenix.   In addition, private Kuwaiti investors -- not subject tothe asset freeze -- hold an undetermined stake in Investcorp,which owns Saks Fifth Avenue department stores and otherproperties.   MidEast Report estimates Kuwait's U.S. assets at $50billion.   Not even the Treasury Department, charged with enforcingthe asset freeze, has a complete accounting of Kuwait's U.S.investments. The department began a list after Iraq'sinvasion, but had not finished it as of last Friday, aspokeswoman said.   The Treasury wouldn't disclose which companies have beengranted exemptions. The spokeswoman said the exemptions weredesigned &quot;to allow the Kuwati government to conduct itsnormal business in the smoothest way possible while assuringthat no benefits accrue to Iraq.&quot;   The department also has issued general exemptions forcategories of companies, such as telephone and foreignexchange companies that meet certain conditions.   According to one measure by the Commerce Department,Kuwait's direct investments in U.S. companies totaled $4.2billion last year. That figure doesn't account forinvestments made through intermediaries such as Kuwaiticompanies not based in Kuwait.   Nor does it include investments in companies that resultin less than 10% of the voting stock, nor Kuwait's&quot;portfolio&quot; accounts of stocks, bonds and other investmentsbeing managed by U.S. investment houses.   David T. Mizrahi, editor of MidEast Report, estimates 25%of Kuwait's U.S. assets are held in portfolio accounts atfirms including J.P. Morgan andamp; Co., Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. Inc.and Citicorp.   By a broader measure last taken in 1988, the value of allU.S. companies in which Kuwait held at least 10% controltotaled $10 billion.   But since that Commerce Department figure includes thefull value of those companies no matter what the size ofKuwait's stake, it most likely overstates Kuwait'sinvestment.   Former Treasury Secretary G. William Miller helps manageKuwait's U.S. assets, MidEast Report says. Among Kuwait'sU.S. investment groups is the Wafra Investment Advisory Groupof New York, which invests Kuwaiti pension funds.   Much of Kuwait's assets world-wide are managed by theKuwaiti Investment Office in London.</TEXT></DOC>
