StevensStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 07/16/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> CANDA FREST JAPAN EUROPFOREIGN-EXCHANGE MARKETS (FRX)MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)PRECIOUS METALS, STONES, GOLD, SILVER (PCS)COMMODITY NEWS, FARM PRODUCTS (CMD) </IN><TEXT>   News of a widened U.S. trade deficit for May threw the dollar into a steep dive in heavy trading, with the U.S. currency falling 1.6% against the Japanese yen.    The drop reversed the dollar's recent hard-won gains, and some dealers predicted that it will return to the narrow range it has traded in for nearly all of this year.    &quot;The sentiment changed today,&quot; Michael Snow, senior vice president, foreign exchange, for Union Bank of Switzerland in New York said, referring to the response to the trade news. &quot;The dollar will have a hard time rising in the next few weeks,&quot; he said.    &quot;I think it's stable but at lower levels,&quot; Mr. Snow said.    When the Commerce Department said the U.S. merchandise trade deficit widened to $14.4 billion in May from $13.32 billion in April, the dollar dropped like a rock and within minutes stood at its intraday low of 148.35 yen. In late New York trading, the currency was at 148.83 yen, compared with 151.23 Tuesday.    In early trading today in Tokyo, the dollar was quoted at 148.95 yen.    The dollar also fell 1.3% to 1.8293 West German marks from 1.8535. These were the currency's lowest levels since before the July 4 weekend.    The dollar's rapid descent after the trade report partly resulted from the flight of dealers who had taken speculative positions on a widespread rumor Tuesday that the trade deficit had narrowed to $11 billion. Foreign exchange dealers had placed particular importance on the May figure, which could have continued or accelerated the dollar's recent recovery.    &quot;This puts a lid on the dollar for now,&quot; Ronald H. Holzer, vice president and chief dealer at Harris Trust andamp; Savings Bank, Chicago, said. &quot;It identifies the upper end of the trading range.&quot;    Mr. Holzer predicted that the dollar will move lower through the end of next week, when two more U.S. economic indicators -- June durable-goods orders and the second-quarter growth in gross national product -- are expected to show a weak economy.    If predictions of a return to range trading are correct, a well-worn path awaits the currency. Since mid-January, the dollar has traded between its recent highs and its lows of 137 yen and 1.77 marks, but it has spent most of the time in a much narrower range.    Garrett R. Glass, vice president, foreign exchange, at First National Bank of Chicago, estimated that the dollar has wavered in the range of 1.82 to 1.83 marks for about one-third of all trading days in 1987.    &quot;The trend is not your friend this year, because there has been none,&quot; he said.    Much of that stability has been due to the actions of the central banks of the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France and Britain. They spent nearly $40 billion this spring to intervene in support of the dollar under an agreement to police exchange-rate movements.    There were unconfirmed reports yesterday that the U.S. Federal Reserve stepped into the market to brake the dollar's fall. Some traders said the possibility of renewed central bank support, along with a recent influx of foreign capital, makes it unlikely that the dollar will fall to new lows in the near future.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery climbed $5.90 an ounce to $453.20 in brisk trading. Estimated volume was five million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $453.35 an ounce in early trading today in Hong Kong.    ---                   LATE NEW YORK TRADING                  Wednesday, July 15, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
