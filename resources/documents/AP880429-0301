But new forecasts issued Friday painted a different picture forthe coming week. The National Weather Service predicted warmer andslightly drier weather than normal conditions for the region inboth its 30-day and 90-day forecasts.   ``The soybean market is extremely sensitive to weather becauseif we don't have a good crop this year they're going to cut thatcarryover down to the bone,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader forDean Witter Reynolds Inc.

Cattle futures settled steady to slightly higher on the ChicagoMercantile Exchange in light trading that reflected nervousnessabout last week's government reports showing larger-than-expectednumbers of cattle being fattend for slaughter.   ``Based on the cattle-on-feed report, we should see substantialfed cattle marketings coming out,'' said Tom O'Hare, an analyst inNew York with Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. ``If that happensand the market can't handle it, we'll see prices break.''   Pork futures were mixed to lower due to an increase in theaverage daily slaughterhouse kills this week, he said.
