Nitrogen oxides help form ozone, acid rain and the formation ofairborne particles that hamper visibility.   Some of nitrogen oxide compounds also contribute to the globalwarming embodied in the ``greenhouse effect'' theory while othersmay be more damaging to health than previously believed, theassociation said.   ``Aggressive control of (nitrogen oxides) is necessary, feasibleand long overdue,'' said Peg Garland of the association, whichrecommended reducing nitrogen oxide emissions by about 4 millionmetric tons a year, from about 20 million metric tons now. To dothat would cost the economy about $3 per person per year, she said.   Several technologies can reduce emissions; catalytic devicesused in West Germany and Japan are achieving 90 percent reductions.   Nitrogen oxides, which result from any combustion, have longbeen recognized as important pollutants. In recent years, however,congressional attention has been largely focused on sulfurcompounds, which also form acid rain; on EPA policies for dealingwith the failure of many cities to meet ozone standards, and onemissions of industrial chemicals.   About half of all nitrogen oxides come from industrial fuelcombustion, mostly in power plants, while 40 percent come frommotor vehicle exhausts, according to estimates by the EnvironmentalProtection Agency.   If nothing is done, power plant emissions are expected to doublein 30 years and total emissions to increase by 50 percent, theassociation said.   New power plants must meet strict emissions limits, with coalplants achieving a 65 percent reduction from what their emissionswould otherwise be. There are no standards for plants built before1971, however.   The association said that new plants should be forced to reduceemissions by 90 percent and old plants should be required toinstall control equipment achieving 80 percent to 90 percentreductions over the next decade.   Current federal standards for auto exhausts in all states butCalifornia result in about a 75 percent reduction in emissions froman uncontrolled car. California, which has tougher standards of itsown, is tightening its standards to achieve a 90 percent reductionby the 1991 model year.   The association said that Congress, in its debates this year onrevising the Clean Air Act, should extend the new California autostandard to the rest of the country.   Almost 100 cities fail to meet federal ozone standards, and JohnHolmes, chief researcher for the California Air Resources Board,said the EPA's strategies for fighting ozone have losteffectiveness by neglecting nitrogen oxides.   For sustained ozone formation, both nitrogen oxides andhydrocarbon vapors like unburned gasoline are necessary. In someareas, reductions in nitrogen oxides can increase ozone, so the EPAhas stressed to states and cities that they should reducehydrocarbon emissions.   John Bachmann, an EPA environmental engineer, said he believedthe agency's concerns were converging with Holmes'.   ``If the numbers are high enough, there's no question he'sright,'' Bachmann said.   Bruce Jordan of the office said the agency was requiring statesto consider nitrogen oxide reductions in revising their airpollution control plans.   Speaking for himself and not the agency, Bachman said arequirement for a 90 percent emissions reduction in all cases wouldbe ``technically premature.''   The agency's spokesman on air issues did not immediately returna phone call.</TEXT></DOC>
