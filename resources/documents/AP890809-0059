Earlier Tuesday, Rabin told reporters after meeting U.N. envoyMarrack Goulding that confirming the Israelis were alive must be afirst stage in contacts with Shiite radicals believed to hold theIsraeli soldiers and most of the 16 foreign hostages in Lebanon.   As a second step, Rabin added, Israel would provide the Shiiteswith information on the whereabouts of an estimated 300 of theirfollowers imprisoned by Israel.   ``Only then will we negotiate the terms for the exchange,'' hesaid.   Rabin also said Israel considers the International Committee ofthe Red Cross to be ``the most suitable'' channel for negotiating aswap with the pro-Iranian Hezbollah movement, an umbrellaorganization for Shiite fundamentalist groups in Lebanon.   Hezbollah today claimed responsibility for a suicide car bombattack in south Lebanon that injured five Israeli soldiers and aLebanese militiaman. The two suicide car bombers died in the blastfive miles north of the Israeli border.   Rabin indicated there had been little progress made so far inresolving the hostage crisis, by saying, ``Unfortunately until thismoment no Lebanese organization turned to the International RedCross with any proposal.''   ``Whoever wants real business, it's better to turn to theInternational Red Cross with whatever terms he has in mind,'' Rabinadded.   Goulding, who returned to New York after shuttling betweenBeirut and Tel Aviv on the hostage situation, said his meeting withRabin focused on U.N. demands that Israel release a Moslem clerickidnapped by Israeli commandos from south Lebanon on July 28.   Rabin rejected the demand saying 33-year-old Sheikh Abdul KarimObeid would be freed only as part of a swap for Israeli and foreignhostages in Lebanon.   The Israeli leader also differed with Goulding's assertion thatObeid's capture ``does not help'' efforts to free hostages. ``Ibelieve the fact it was done provides a bigger chance to return theIsraeli soldiers missing and the captives home,'' Rabin said.   The three Israeli soldiers believed to be held by Hezbollah areRahamim Alsheikh and Yosef Fink, who were captured in south Lebanonin February 1986, and an air navigator, Ron Arad, shot down whileon a bombing mission near Sidon in October 1986.   Shlomo Alsheikh, the father of one of the Israeli prisoners heldby the Shiites, was quoted today by the Yediot Ahronot daily assaying he learned 10 days ago ``for the first time that he (hisson, Rahamim) is alive.''   ``That's what we were told. We were told that there isinformation our son is alive and well, thank God,'' Alsheikh said.   Alsheikh did not make clear where he received the information,and Israeli officials refused to discuss the report.</TEXT></DOC>
