(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Chrysler Corp. plans to replace itsDodge Spirit and Plymouth Acclaim compact cars in about five years,and is pushing back the introduction of a new luxury car, anexecutive says.   Glenn Gardner, Chrysler's general manager of new platformengineering, said Thursday that a new version of the Spirit-Acclaimhas a potential for more sales than a new luxury car, so theintroduction of the compact car was moved ahead of the luxury car.   Originally, Chrysler's new luxury car, codenamed the LX, was tobe introduced shortly after its new midsize car, the LH, bowed inlate 1992 for the 1993 model year.   Gardner said the company's most pressing product priority wasthe LH. In fact, he said, Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca wants thecar out earlier.   ``Mr. Iacocca said he wants six months (cut from theintroduction schedule). I told him he can't have it,'' Gardnersaid. ``He's a very persistent individual.''   Gardner's comments came during the fourth day of a week-longmanagement conference sponsored by the University of Michigan.   ``An LX is obviously one of those (cars) you have a chance to door not do and not break the corporation,'' Gardner said.``Obviously the LH is critical to the corporation.''   Wall Street analysts have criticized Chrysler for opting tobuild the Viper low-volume, high-performance sports car when thecompany should accelerate development of the LH midsize car.   Between the introduction of the LH and the Spirit-Acclaimsuccessor, Chrysler is expected to bring out a new subcompact car.Chrysler left the subcompact segment when it shut down a Detroitassembly plant that built the Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon lastFebruary.   The Spirit-Acclaim successor will be introduced sometime around1995, Gardner said. The cars originally were introduced in thespring of 1989 and are assembled in Newark, Del.   Chrysler is realigning its vehicle development programs about ayear after Iacocca said a billion-dollar cost-cutting program wouldnot alter new-vehicle development plans.   ``Our $15 billion, five-year program remains intact and we don'tcomment on specific future products that are contained in thatprogram,'' Chrysler spokesman Tom Houston said.   Also at the conference, Ford Motor Co. officially unveiled its4.6-liter, V-8 engine for the 1991 Lincoln Town Car which goes intoproduction later this year.   The engine to be built at Ford's $780 million revamped engineplant in Romeo, Mich., is the first of the company's ``modular''family of engines. Modular engines give manufacturers flexibilityand cost reductions by creating a common basic engine structurewith interchangeable components giving each kind of engine its owncharacteristics.   ``Overall, we estimate the new family of engines will shareabout 350 parts, or about 75 percent of the engine,'' said David F.Hagen, general manager of Ford's engine division. ``New V-8variations will cost about $60 million to develop compared to about$500 million for a typical new engine program.''   He said the modular engine concept will be expanded to Ford'shuge Cleveland engine plant, which will build a new series of V-6engines to go into production in the mid-1990s.</TEXT></DOC>
