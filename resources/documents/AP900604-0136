Lanston andamp; Co.   Increased productivity, or getting each worker to produce morefor each hour he or she works, is vital to increasing Americans'standard of living without inflation, many economists say.   ``The first quarter is a very dismal statement on that score,''said Allen Sinai, chief economist at the Boston Co.   Donald Ratajczak, director of Georgia State University's economicforecasting center, said poor productivity might mean Americans'standard of living ``is going to drift backward.''   It also weakens the nation's ability to compete internationally,analysts said.   While productivity was falling, unit labor costs, a key gauge offuture price inflation, shot up at an annual rate of 7 percent.That's putting a squeeze on profits, Sinai said.   ``Businesses can't keep on employing people at those costs withso little production,'' he said.   The 2.7 percent productivity drop was the worst performance sinceproductivity fell at a rate of 5.5 percent in the fourth quarter of1981, the Labor Department said.   Private analysts said much of the decline was related to theoverall slowdown of the economy and was typical of an economy at theend of expansion.   The gross national product _ the total output of goods andservices _ grew at a sluggish 1.3 percent annual rate for the firstquarter.   Monday's report, which provided revised figures on the firstquarter of 1990, showed the nation's lagging productivity was farworse than earlier reported. Original data showed productivityfalling 1 percent.   The GNP growth of 1.3 percent had also been revised downward frompreliminary data showing 2.1 percent growth.   The 7 percent jump in unit labor costs for the January-Marchperiod compared with a 4.5 percent increase during all of 1989.   Hourly labor costs _ a major inflation measure for businesses _rose at an annual rate of 4.1 percent in the first quarter of 1990.Those costs increased by 5.5 percent for all of 1989.   The report provided one bit of good news _ productivity in themanufacturing sector climbed 4.9 percent so far this year, a hugeimprovement over the 2 percent increase during all of 1989.   Unit labor costs in that sector dropped 1.3 percent, comparedwith the 2.2 percent increase during all of last year.   Jones said factory workers' productivity was encouraging becauseit might mean ``businesses have become leaner and meaner with thefinancial restructuring of the 1980s.''   ``Maybe the one positive fallout of the takeover craze has beenthe cutbacks of excessive management and layoffs of unproductiveworkers,'' Jones said.   Ratajczak said manufacturers ``are feeling the heat of foreigncompetition the strongest.''   ``We don't know what it's going to take for retailers to becomemore efficient,'' he said.   Total business productivity, including farming, fell 2.1 percentfor the first quarter compared with a 1.1 percent gain for all of1989.   Since 1982, productivity growth has averaged 1.8 percent a year.While a slight improvement over the 1.2 percent average growth ratein the 1970s, it was still far below th 3.3 percent rate of increaseposted in the two decades after World War II.   During all of last year, productivity rose just 0.9 percent, thepoorest showing since the 1981-82 recession.   Monday's report showed that output in the non-farm sector rose 1percent during the first quarter of 1990, well below the 3.9 percentincrease in the number of hours worked.</TEXT></DOC>
