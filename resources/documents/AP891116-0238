Get your weight guessed,your fortune told, your arteries clogged, test your strength, win astuffed animal, win two, one for the little lady, scare yourselfwitless on a G-force ride.   Welcome to the 71st trade show of the International Associationof Amusement Parks and Attractions.   Despite all the glitz, bells and whistles at the show, one factshines like a carnival spotlight: Most of what's new on the Midwayhas been there in various forms for a long, long time.   At this year's show, the industry's biggest with more than 600exhibitors, nostalgia runs neck-and-neck with computerized fantasyfor the carnival dollar.   Tom Collins of Niagara Falls, Ontario, is selling aweight-guessing scale for $24,500. It's a reproduction of one atthe Chicago's Century of Progress exposition, held 1933-34 alongthe downtown lakefront.   Weight-guessing has been a carnival staple since the 1890s, hesaid, and is one of the only carnival games the customer doesn'tplay.   ``The guesser does the work,'' he said. ``We think it's a goodidea to dig out an old ideaand redo it.''   Carousel dealers, too, agree that old is in.   Tony Rae of the American Carousel Works of Diamond Bar, Calif.,said the company's craftsmen still carve wooden horses. They don'tcome cheap: $4,400 for the standard carousel horse.   Intamin Service Corp.'s carousels, the brochure correctly notes,look 100 years old. They are replicas of the old steam carousels,and the horses are made from molds of the wooden originals.   Barbara Zaichick and her husband, Gerald, of Miami, haveautomated the Gypsy fortune teller, but they said their artistswere careful to keep the old theme.   She said the newer video attractions and other modernizations ofthe carnival trade ``are getting tired.''   Her coin-operated fortune machines are good at telling you whatyou want to hear.   ``There is enough negative in the world,'' Mrs. Zaichick said.   One taker was pronounced to be cultured, reserved, realistic,ambitious, friendly, aesthetic, energetic, perceptive,individualistic, enterprising, affectionate, sophisticated,courageous, considerate, responsive, conventional, discriminating,self-composed, disciplined and tender-hearted with a keenforesight, quick mind and good memory.   All true, and all for 50 cents.   Another machine offers a sex analysis.   Never mind.   An Italian firm is marketing ``The Mouth of Truth,'' a replicaof a Roman stone museum piece. Put your hand in the mouth, and itreads your hand and tells your future.   The barker, the old-time pitchman and the sleazy looking rideoperator didn't make this year's show.   But their bosses did, and they have their checkbooks. About10,000 people in the industry are registered. More than 150 millionAmericans will visit IAAPA member parks this year.   The dart games, ducking stools and full-sized carnival rideshere are interspersed with the more basic ice machines, ticketprinters, fast-food equipment and carnival insurance companies thatbring it all back to Earth.   But there's always room on the Midway for the novel such as theDenson Funnel Cake Machine. It cranks out one deep-fried cake every18 seconds, a sign notes.   And there's the pigs.   The Bob Hale Pig Racing Stables has 10 mobile units of 20 pigseach and goes around the country to fairs and, increasingly, tocompany picnics and other gatherings. The stables use the AsianPot-Bellied Pig and the Mexican hairless.   ``Thrills, Chills, Spills and FUN!!'' promises the brochure.``Up to 28 races a day!''   Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!</TEXT></DOC>
