ROSENTHAL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   NASA has White House approval to proceed withits much-debated October launch of a nuclear-powered satellite toJupiter.   President Bush's science adviser, D. Allan Bromley, signed theauthorization Friday which is required before a nuclear device isput into space. Bromley had the president's approval, said WhiteHouse spokeswoman Alixe Reed.   NASA Administrator Richard Truly was informed, she said. Themission would have been scrubbed had White House approval beenwithheld.   Critics worried about nuclear fallout in case of an accident willask a court to stop the launch, and promise to try to put theirbodies in the way if that doesn't work.   The Galileo probe will be sent on its eight-year, $1.4 billionmission from the cargo bay of the space shuttle Atlantis _ the firsttime nuclear power has been carried on a shuttle.   The three men and two women who will be on the Oct. 12 missionwere in Washington today for a breakfast with Vice President DanQuayle at his residence.   Quayle, who intends to be at the Kennedy Space Center for theliftoff, heads the National Space Council and was particularlyinterested in meeting the astronauts because shuttle commanderDonald E. Williams is from Indiana, Quayle's home state.   Protesters claim a Challenger-like accident could poison Earth'satmosphere with ``the most toxic substance in the universe.'' Theyare preparing to file suit in federal court to stop the mission anda protest march is scheduled to begin at Cape Canaveral, Fla. onSunday.   Bruce Gagnon, a leader in the Florida Coalition for Peace andJustice, said ``we are going to attempt to enter the launch area andsit on the launch pad.'' He has written that ``Plutonium 238 is themost toxic substance in the universe. If ingested, it concentratesin the bone marrow where it can cause leukemia. If inhaled, itsticks to the lungs, where it can lead to cancer.''   The Galileo spacecraft was originally scheduled for launch inJanuary 1982 but was delayed time and again.   It is outfitted with two radioisotope thermoelectric generatorsto produce the electricity for the spacecraft, science instrumentsand engineering support systems. Of the 22 RTGs used on previousmissions, three have been involved in accidents _ one releasing17,000 curies of radioactive material 75 miles high over the IndianOcean.   The generators use the heat from the radioactive decay ofplutonium-238 dioxide to generate electricity. NASA estimates theprobability of having a launch accident that results in the releaseof plutonium into the atmosphere is one in 2,800.   RTGs similar to the ones on Galileo provided the power forVoyager 2, which recently sent back spectacular views of the planetNeptune. Voyager 2, launched in 1977, was the last spacecraftcarrying a nuclear power source.</TEXT></DOC>
