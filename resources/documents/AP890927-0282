The stock dropped at the opening bell and ended up down $6 ashare to $111.50 on heavy volume of more than 5 million shares.   IBM is the most valuable company in the United States asmeasured by its market value and is a component of the Dow Jonesindustrial average of 30 stocks. The average managed a gain of 9.12points to 2,673.06, but it would have risen more without IBM's drop.   Besides its quarterly troubles, IBM said that if the effects ofthe stronger dollar and the shift to leasing by IBM customerscontinues for the rest of 1989, ``it will also be difficult for IBMto achieve full-year results within the current range ofestimates.''   The rise of the dollar hurts reported earnings of multinationalssuch as IBM by cutting the dollar value of profits that are made inforeign currencies. The shift to leasing from buying cuts intoshort-term revenue by spreading out payments received from placingnew products with customers.   In addition, IBM said profits were being hurt in theJuly-September quarter by the transition to a new range ofproducts, which increases costs and temporarily depresses revenueby interrupting sales of the older lines.   IBM Chairman John F. Akers said demand for IBM products andservices continues to be good worldwide. He said the companyexpects growth in all major geographic areas for the year, with therate of growth continuing to be stronger outside the United States.   IBM had been expected to earn about $2.22 a share in the currentquarter, according to a survey of 23 security analysts by theInstitutional Brokers Estimate System of Lynch, Jones andamp; Ryan. Therange of estimates was $2.14 to $2.28.   Frank Metz, IBM's chief financial officer, told an analyst thatnet earnings in the current quarter would be measurably below the$1.95 a share in operating earnings the company had a year ago,spokesman Peter Thonis confirmed.   For the full year, the average estimate of 42 analysts had been$10.36 a share and the range was $10 to $10.80, the estimateservice said.</TEXT></DOC>
