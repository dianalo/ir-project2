(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Lloyd Bentsen, heaping scorn on GeorgeBush in a must-win state where the Democrats have lost their lead,said Wednesday that only the distortions of the Republican campaigncould allow the vice president to claim he's an environmentalist.   ``Can anyone here give me just one piece of evidence to supportthe claim George Bush made the other day when he woke up andannounced that he's an environmentalist?'' Bentsen asked hisaudience of Stanford University students.   The Democratic vice presidential nominee said Bush ``sat in theCabinet with (former Interior Secretary) James Watt and (formerEnvironmental Protection Agency chief) Anne Gorsuch _ the Bonnieand Clyde environmental wrecking crew.''   Today, he said, Bush is trying to minimize his past support ofoffshore drilling in California while accusing Dukakis of opposinganti-pollution efforts by airing television commercials on thefilth in Boston Harbor.   ``They've been dumping in the Boston Harbor since a group ofpatriots went down one night and threw some tea overboard,''Bentsen said. ``Mike Dukakis is the first governor of thatcommonwealth to do something about cleaning up the mess.''   It was Bush's administration ``that cut off money to clean upBoston Harbor,'' the Texas senator said. ``Mike Dukakis has theendorsement of the League of Conservation voters, and as to GeorgeBush, well, he's no friend of the environment.''   (In Boston, Dukakis picked up an endorsement from Russell W.Peterson, the Republican former president of the National AudubonSociety, who credited the governor with financing programs to cleanup the Charles River and Boston Harbor.)   Quoting Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., Bentsen said that ``GeorgeBush might be an environmentalist ... it just depends on whatenvironment he is in.''   Dukakis' running mate accused Republicans of bending the truthand refusing to make specific proposals on important issues,thereby ``reducing the caliber of a national campaign to that of amid-wrestling festival out at the Cow Palace,'' a sports arenaoutside San Francisco.   ``They have force-fed sound bites to the evening news andlaughed behind the backs of voters demanding some honesty aboutAmerica's future,'' Bentsen said.   ``They have viciously slandered the patriotism and record ofMichael Dukakis and then turned around and whistled sweetness andlight when they are called to account,'' he said.   Later, talking to reporters, Bentsen expressed frustration thatthe GOP campaign was forcing the Democrats to spend their timeresponding to false charges, such as a new TV commercial allegingthat Dukakis was opposed to new military projects.   But Bentsen said it was necessary to respond so long as Bush'speople ``dump these kind of lies'' on the public.   Bentsen spoke Wednesday in the shadow of Stanford's HooverTower, named after Depression-era President Herbert Hoover, on thefirst anniversary of the Oct. 19, 1987, stock market crash.   The tower, he said, ``serves as a warning that this nation'seconomy still hovers precariously in the shadows of a mountain ofinternational and domestic debt.''   Bentsen was defiantly optimistic about the Democrats' chances ofwinning the Nov. 8 election, even after learning that a new FieldPoll showed Bush leading 50 percent to 41 percent in California,whose 47 electoral votes are the most of any state.   The Republicans were trying to ``dig us a grave and tell us tojump in,'' he said. ``Well, let's tell them to jump in the lake.''   ``We're going to tell the experts to eat a little crow on themorning of Nov. 9, and we may let them eat a little quail, too,''he said, referring to Bush running mate Dan Quayle.   Before leaving Stanford to fly to Kentucky, Bentsen visited theStanford Linear Accelerator with Nobel laureate Burton Richter andSally Ride, a former space shuttle astronaut who is a researchfellow at Stanford.   Asked if she supported the Democrats, she told reporters shewould not back either party. ``Astronauts are non-non-partisan,''she said.</TEXT></DOC>
