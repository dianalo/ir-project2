The venture, known as Alliance for Productive Technology,hopes to create a standardized software system to letinsurance agents transmit and retrieve information fromseveral companies without having to re-enter policyholderdata several times.</LP><TEXT>   But consumer groups and insurance-industry criticsexpressed skepticism about the likely benefits of the plannedsystem. Moreover, the approach excludes the direct insurancewriters, companies such as State Farm Mutual AutomobileInsurance Co., Nationwide Insurance Co. and AllstateInsurance Co., a unit of Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co., that havetheir own sales personnel, rather than working throughindependent agents around the country.   Industry studies have found that these companies arealready more efficient than the agency companies and offergenerally better pricing to consumers.   Participating in the network venture are CNA InsuranceCos., Fund America Cos.' Fireman's Fund Insurance unit,Travelers Corp. and New Hampshire Insurance Co., a unit ofAmerican International Group Inc. They will provide some ofthe capital to develop the software link that agents andcompanies will be using.   The aim is to make both the agents and the insurers moreefficient. Automation in the insurance industry remainsfragmented, and no standard for linking companies and agentsexists.   Agents need to be more productive, said Thomas Eustace,chairman and chief executive officer of Applied Systems Inc.,one of the data-management companies involved in the project.He acknowledged that efficiencies envisioned by this softwaresystem will be achieved only if many companies use it. Theother data-management firm is Agency Management Systems Inc.,a Norwell, Mass.-based firm that is jointly owned by CNA,Fireman's Fund and New Hampshire Insurance.   Robert Hunter, head of the National Insurance ConsumersOrganization, said the need to develop such systems is &quot;anadmission that there are some fairly large inefficiencies&quot; ininsurance company operations.   He said he agrees that companies could achieve significantsavings if their back offices didn't have to re-enterinformation they get from agents several times, such aspricing, billing and claims processing. However, consumersmay not see any immediate benefit from this computer link, hesaid.   Unlike the airline reservation systems, which givesconsumers with a personal computer access to airfare listingsand schedules, this system won't be available to the public.Consumers will still have to rely on agents to get pricinginformation.   &quot;If the consumer isn't given good pricing information,then (this system won't) do the consumer any good,&quot; said MarkCooper, an economist with the Consumer Federation of America.   A variety of data management companies already providecomputers and software to automate insurance agents' offices.But some of these systems are incompatible and they forceagents to re-enter the same data for such operations asaccounting and pricing. Also, many of the major insurers, whowork through independent agents, have developed their ownsystems for their agents to use, often making ittime-consuming and cumbersome for agents to deal with morethan a few companies.   &quot;Some companies try to compete for agents based onautomation they can offer. They ought to compete on the basisof price and service,&quot; said Patricia A. Borowski, head ofgovernment and industry affairs for the National Associationof Professional Insurance Agents.   The insurance industry has been trying to establish adata-communications system between agents and insurancecompanies for several years now, but success has beenminimal. &quot;It's not a technology issue,&quot; Ms. Borowski said.&quot;It's a political issue of whether or not (an insurer) wantsto have its agents communicate with multiple companies orgive them a system to communicate with just one company.&quot;   The standardized software being developed by the jointventure will be marketed to all property-casualty companies.Lawrence Bacon, senior vice president for data-processing atTravelers, said the various data-management firms thatspecialize in agency automation should be able to incorporatethis software in the various systems they now sell.</TEXT></DOC>
