Officials were pleased at the number of gators taken and thesafety record among the 230 hunters issued permits for the hunt,which lasted throughout September.   Only two minor injuries were reported. One man shot off hisfinger with a ``bang stick'' on Lake George, and another was bittenon the arm, according to a preliminary report on the hunt.   Commission officials had predicted the hunters would kill 2,600alligators, or about 75 percent of the 3,450 limit. The hunt wascalled to promote interest in state wetlands and to trim thealligator population, which has doubled since anti-poaching measureswere adopted in 1970.   Jennings said regulations governing next year's hunt may bealtered following a study on the 28 areas in this year's harvest.   The hunt will bring the total alligators killed this year toabout 8,000, said John White, a wildlife biologist with thecommission.   Nuisance trappers, who kill alligators that threaten people,destroy about 5,000 animals a year in Florida, where the animal'spopulation is estimated at 1 million.   Louisiana has harvested more than 20,000 alligators every yearsince 1971. In Texas, where hunts resumed in 1984, about 1,500gators are taken annually.   Despite the lure of profits for the gators, which can bring up to$1,000 per foot in meat and hide, the riches came mostly in form ofmemories.   ``This was more for the experience than anything. It was a greatway to see the real Florida,'' said James Gelardi, whose 13-foot-4,770-pound gator was the biggest caught during the hunt.   ``I think the game commission did a great job,'' said JimmyDouglas, a Sumter County nuisance trapper who took his 15-gatorlimit in 2{ nights.   ``But this is the first year, when everybody was real cautious.As time goes on people are going to get more careless,'' he said.``I hear people saying already that getting a gator ain't nothing.Well, I've seen a gator crush my fiberglass boat like it was paper.All I can say is `Be careful.'''</TEXT></DOC>
