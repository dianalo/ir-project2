The following items have been studiedon their current situations: drilling time analysis on 13 geothermalwells drilled by NEDO; questionare to 9 domestic geothermal developerenterprises to obtain information on their bussiness status; to investigatecurrent activities of 5 geothermal well drilling companies in U.S.A.and Italy. Investigations of countermeasures for improving well drillingwork efficiency, such as reducing the time of rig-up and rig-down, preventionand countermeasures against borehole troubles, improvement of rate ofpenetration have been carried out. Furthermore, investigations of organizationfor well drilling work such as education and training of drilling crewand secure of drilling supervisors have been conducted. Having summerizedthe items examined for improving the geothermal well drilling efficiency,the goals of improvement of the efficiency and the future tasks in themainly technical aspect are extracted. Example of the content is as follows,shortening rig-up and down time set to less than 15 days for rig-up andless than 10 days for rig-down, by securing drilling site area.
