The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said it has directed its staffto rewrite the agency's rules to make the hostile intent of an Sandamp;Lstock buyer one of the grounds for denial of an application forthree years after an institution converts from mutal to stockownership. The bank board normally has authority to decide who mayown a thrift institution.   The move comes after the board denied investor groups permissionto acquire more than 10 percent of the stock of two institutions,Gateway Federal Savings and Loan Association of Cincinnati, andHome Unity Savings and Loan Association of Lafayette Hill, Pa. Theinstitutions said the purchase efforts were unsolicited.   The board said hostile takeovers ``divert managerial resources''and would discourage Sandamp;Ls from converting from mutual to stockownership.</TEXT></DOC>
