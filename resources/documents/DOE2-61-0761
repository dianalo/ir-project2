The shrinkage duringsintering tests at a constant heating rate has been measured with a hightemperature dilatometer. For the sake of interpretation of processesoccuring at different temperatures the phase composition has been determinedafter sintering at 1410/sup 0/C, 1610/sup 0/C and 1850/sup 0/C. Moreover,the microstructural observations have been made by means of optical microscope,scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope.</TEXT></DOC>
