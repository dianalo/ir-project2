Boucek</HL><DD> 12/12/86</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> CANDA </IN><DATELINE> TORONTO  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The landslide victory in 1984 of Brian Mulroney and his Progressive Conservative party was widely expected to bring on a new era in Canadian politics. Canada only had to follow the road map drawn by Ronald Reagan, with whom Mr. Mulroney claims a close personal relationship.    Two years later, Mr. Mulroney still trudges along the ruts worn by his Liberal Party predecessors. Rather than cut expensive social programs, his government raised personal, corporate and sales taxes. Today, some 52% of the nation's gross domestic product is usurped by one tax or another, compared with 37% in the U.S. &quot;The government has misjudged the temper of the times,&quot; says Michael Walker, director in Vancouver of the free-market-oriented Fraser Institute. &quot;It may pay a high price for having failed to take a firmer stance on some of the more important social and economic issues.&quot;    Foreign policy hasn't changed much either. The Conservatives led the Commonwealth's imposition of sanctions against South Africa, welcomed a Nicaraguan trade office to Toronto and refused formal participation by the Canadian government in any research or development of America's Strategic Defense Initiative (the government did, however, allow private companies to bid on U.S. contracts).    Canada's small &quot;c&quot; conservatives have little influence over the official Conservative Party. For starters, the Canadian political system has no place for a renegade inside a party -- someone like Barry Goldwater. Traditional party unity in the House of Commons requires every member to support the party line. The surest way to gag an independent thinker is to elect him to Parliament.    Nevertheless, about 30 to 40 Tory members of Parliament (out of 211 Tory MPs in the 282-seat House of Commons) recently formed a conservative caucus to try to influence the Tory program. &quot;We have told the prime minister it is time we kept our promises,&quot; says one member. The group wants sizable cuts in the civil service, support for SDI and a &quot;free vote&quot; -- in which members aren't bound by party discipline -- on the restoration of capital punishment. But the MP confesses the group isn't likely to voice its opinion in public because of the prime minister's extensive control of the federal pork barrel.    Private funding of the conservative agenda is another problem. Six Toronto and Montreal banks control 91% of the banking assets in Canada, while five oil refiners, one state-owned, the others foreign-owned, hold 86% of that market. Nationally, there are two airlines, two railways and two television networks and, in each case, one is government-owned. Says Geoffrey Hale, vice president of the Canadian Organization of Small Business: &quot;There are no thriving, medium-sized businesses, well-distributed throughout Canada, to provide funds for political action.&quot;    Two years ago, the previous Liberal government, unopposed by the Tories, passed legislation restricting spending on political activism to the official parties, preventing the emergence in Canada of U.S.-style PACs. The National Citizens' Coalition, a leading conservative advocacy group, caused a court to strike down the law on constitutional grounds.    Canada has state funding for parochial schools, little crime and relatively discreet pornography, so conservatives haven't had foot soldiers from the religious right to knock on doors and stuff envelopes. Of course, some of that changed in 1982. Prior to that time, Canada didn't have a formal constitution with a bill of rights like the U.S. does; it relied on British common-law tradition. However, the 1982 constitution, with its sweeping Charter of Rights and Freedoms, resulted in a flood of court cases, sending homosexuals, prostitutes and abortionists into the courts to get what legislatures have denied. This, in turn, galvanized social conservatives, bolstering the membership of family-issue groups like The Coalition for Family Values, Choose Life and REAL Women of Canada.    The Canadian media are largely hostile to conservatives: radio, television, magazines, newspapers, book publishers are all either subsidized or protected from foreign competition, and the market is small for specialized conservative publications. In western Canada, the lively and barely profitable weekly news magazine Alberta Report, with 60,000 circulation, covers regional affairs from a conservative perspective. While conceding the need for a national conservative voice, Alberta Report's proprietor, Ted Byfield, says, &quot;I don't think it's what I'm supposed to do. The challenge is to make it work in the west.&quot;    The central issue in Canadian history remains national unity: keeping the country together despite language differences and the economic pull of the U.S. That's why Mr. Mulroney continues to spend billions on liberal bilingualism programs that haven't made the country more bilingual and have turned entire regions into federal-assistance junkies.    Canadians don't want to become Americans. They like national health care and don't envy U.S. crime rates or its defense burden. U.S. politics are too frantic for Canadian sensibilities. Canadian conservatives have yet to explain, even to themselves, how to do away with old liberal policies while still keeping Canada united and distinct from the U.S. If they ever hope to influence the political agenda, they will have to formulate an alternative vision of an independent Canada that keeps pace with U.S. economic growth.    ---   Mr. Boucek is news editor of the Canadian Dow Jones News Service. </TEXT></DOC>
