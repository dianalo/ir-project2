Jackson on Thursday underscored what he considers Dukakis'weaknesses _ domestic economic proposals and the situation insouthern Africa _ and he said that his own platform offers voters aclear alternative to the front-runner. In contrast to theconciliatory tone he has struck throughout the primary campaign,Jackson appears to be taking off the gloves a bit with Dukakis.   In speeches Thursday he also criticized the Massachusettsgovernor for not having a plan to pay for his proposal to providehigher education for every young person.   In an interview with The Associated Press, Jackson said he wantsto keep his campaign issues on his party's political agenda even ifhe does not become the Democratic nominee. But he said he is notconceding the nomination to Dukakis as the governor is pulling awayfrom him in the delegate count.   ``My role now is to raise distinctions and give people achoice,'' he said.   The AP delegate count shows Dukakis has amassed 1,276 delegatesto Jackson's 852, with 2,081 needed to win the nomination thissummer.   ``I've got my second wind,'' Jackson told a gymnasium full offans at the University of Toledo. ``I`ve just begun to fight.''   As for comments attributed to his campaign manager, GeraldAustin, implying that the campaign was now focused less on winningthan on contributing to the party, Jackson told the AP: ``Ourcampaign is a campaign of commitment and content. There is noconflict between campaigning to win and having issues of content tomake a difference.   ``We are trying to win. When you're behind you run a littlefaster.''   Jackson's message on Thursday was that Bush as a member ofPresident Reagan's team wants to continue Reaganomics, while``Dukakis wants to manage Reaganomics. I want to reverseReaganomics.''   He said Dukakis is ``to the right of Reagan'' on South Africabecause Reagan is willing to provide weaponry to Mozambique againstalleged South African-backed rebels, while Dukakis would not do so.   Jackson also lobbed criticism at Democratic party chief PaulKirk, saying in the interview that Kirk should have stepped in whenNew York Mayor Ed Koch was savaging Jackson as an anti-Israelcandidate.   Jackson also indicated unhappiness with the party's oversight ofdelegate selection in some states and in Puerto Rico. He would notsay whether he would challenge any delegate apportionment, but saidthose matters are left to Austin and campaign chairman Willie Brown.   Reflecting on the months of campaigning, Jackson said he feelshe has injected issues that became part of the political dialogue.   ``Our message has been adopted and absorbed,'' he said. ``So nowDukakis is going to schools to speak to students about drugs. He'stalking about reinvesting in America.''   At stake in Tuesday's Ohio primary are 159 Democratic delegates.A Gallup poll this month showed Dukakis with a 2-to-1 lead amongDemocratic voters.</TEXT></DOC>
