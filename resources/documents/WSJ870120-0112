There is little love lost between Helmut Kohl and the West German press. In a country where journalists like to view themselves as sophisticated intellectual commentators, the West German chancellor's homely, often cumbersome style doesn't get much respect.    Reporters mock his long-winded oratory and seemingly provincial manner, and swap unflattering jokes about him such as:    &quot;What's a kohl?    &quot;The shortest distance between two gaffes.&quot;    At times, such as during the news conference at which he announced he wouldn't sack his scandal-ridden defense minister, they openly show their ridicule, laughing out loud to his face.    &quot;Fumbling, irritable, inhibited&quot; is how Stern magazine described him this month, reflecting the view of many.    The antagonism is mutual. Mr. Kohl grows visibly tense and defensive on the rare occasions when he is faced with a room full of reporters. Hunched forward on his seat, he answers often innocuous questions in a vengeful tone. Sensing hostility, he is likely to snap out one of the well-worn phrases he uses to signal his irritation: &quot;Ich denk' nicht dran&quot; (I wouldn't dream of it), or &quot;Aber Sie wissen so gut wie ich&quot; (But you know as well as I do).    &quot;He mistrusts the press and keeps his distance,&quot; says Claus Gennrich, correspondent for the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung and one of just a handful of journalists the chancellor takes into his confidence. &quot;He feels persecuted, and yet stronger than them.&quot;    It's one of the unusual aspects of Mr. Kohl that he feels he can thrive without the media. Unlike many Western leaders and other West German politicians, who do their best to manipulate the press to their advantage, Mr. Kohl barely makes an effort.    He is uneasy in front of television cameras and boasts that he hardly ever reads newspapers or magazines. His press spokesmen are replaced almost as quickly as empty beer mugs at the Oktoberfest. And he has often said that it is the voter, not the media, whose judgment matters. &quot;He's had such a bad press in the past that he thinks he doesn't need them now,&quot; says one chancellery aide.    To get his message across to the public directly, Mr. Kohl sets himself a grueling agenda. During this year's brief winter election campaign, he has been on the road constantly, making more than 60 appearances across the country. When he does appear on television, he tries to ensure that the program will take the form of a long interview or be shown live, not subject to an editor's whim or political shading.    &quot;Those are the chances for him to show himself,&quot; says Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann, head of the Allensbach polling institute and a personal friend of the chancellor. &quot;Kohl feels he must win the election despite the journalists.&quot;    His tactics seem to work -- or at least they don't seem to harm him too much. Opinion polls may show Mr. Kohl's personal standing in the country isn't as high as that of some colleagues, notably his photogenic finance minister, Gerhard Stoltenberg. But the chancellor, helped by a fairly buoyant economy, is nonetheless well set to be reelected in the West German election Sunday.    &quot;The power of the press here isn't big,&quot; concedes Mr. Gennrich, the reporter, &quot;certainly not as big as in the U.S.&quot;    Mr. Kohl may have reason to feel aggrieved. For years he was generally described as a provincial politician who wouldn't go far. Seldom able to answer a question briefly or speak anything other than German, he was rarely depicted as the stuff chancellors are made of, even by journalists who shared his political views.    Of course, not all German journalists are critical or disrespectful of Mr. Kohl, who may be over-sensitive in the matter. (When German television this New Year accidentally played a year-old message from the chancellor, Mr. Kohl's aides immediately termed it a deliberate act of sabotage.)    But some are still downright hostile. &quot;If you listen to your answers, can you be surprised that nobody is asking questions?&quot; one reporter asked him at a news conference some months ago. More recently, another journalist accused him of being &quot;two-faced.&quot;    Mostly, the chancellor tries to ignore the comments. &quot;He muzzles his reactions completely,&quot; says Mrs. Noelle-Neumann. &quot;He's very sensitive. Nobody likes a bad press.&quot;    But the chancellor seems determined to have the last laugh. Der Spiegel this month published campaign advertisements specially commissioned from each of the major political parties. Mr. Kohl's Christian Democratic Union submitted a large photo of the chancellor biting into a pear, his nickname.    &quot;The Germans have a right to smile,&quot; ran the caption. &quot;Not always when they read Spiegel, but certainly when they vote for Helmut Kohl.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
