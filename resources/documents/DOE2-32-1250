In existing data, TeV and sometimes PeV radiationhas been seen episodically; such an episode is connected with the radioflare of Cyg X-3 in October 1985, when PeV radiation with no phase structurewas seen. The PeV pulse was detected 3-5 days after the radio flare.The author proposes a natural explanation for the delay, in which gamma-photonsof PeV energy are absorbed by radio radiation inside the source. Aftera delay, the gamma radiation emerges as the radio flux diminishes andabsorption decreases.</TEXT></DOC>
