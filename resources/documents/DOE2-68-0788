Therefore, according to the ideas of quantum field theory,a nucleon should continually emit and absorb virtual hadrons. The lightestof these are pions: on the whole, the rho and {omega} mesons determinethe dimensions of the physical nucleon and its static characteristics(mass, magnetic moment, and distribution of mesonic matter inside thenucleon). Owing to the great strength of the interaction, hadrons aretransformed virtually into one another, so that the very concept of ahadron as an elementary particle becomes meaningless. The &quot;bare&quot; hadronwithout its &quot;hadronic cloud&quot; does not exist. The internal structure ofthe nucleon can be investigated experimentally by making use of beamsof leptons, which do not participate in the strong interactions. Accordingto contemporary ideas, leptons are structureless (point) particles. Bystudying lepton-nucleon interactions, it is possible to investigate thedistributions of charge and magnetic moment, and other characteristicsof the nucleon.</TEXT></DOC>
