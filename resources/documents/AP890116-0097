Martin Luther King Jr. on Monday andsuggested South Africa could learn from the civil rights leader'sphilosophy of non-violence.   Perkins, the first black U.S. ambassador to South Africa,acknowledged important differences between the two countries. ``Butsearching for non-violent solutions is probably something worththinking about'' in South Africa, he said.   Perkins joined Zenos Frudakis, the Philadelphia sculptor who madethe bronze bust, in unveiling it under a tent at a Pretoria sitewhere a new U.S. Embassy is to be built.   The event coincided with a federal holiday in the United Stateshonoring King, who was assassinated in 1968. He would have been 60years old Sunday.   The 125 onlookers at the bust unveiling included black and whiteSouth Africans prominent in campaigns against apartheid, and alow-level representative from the South African Ministry of ForeignAffairs.   A 30-member choir from the Roman Catholic church of St. PeterClaver in Mamelodi, a black township near Pretoria, sang severalcivil rights hymns. Women in red headscarves and conical hats wovenfrom grass mingled with dark-suited diplomats.   One hymn was ``Senatla Martin Luther King.'' Senatla means leaderin the Sotho language.   Enos Mabuza, chief minister of South Africa's KaNgwane blackhomeland, told the gathering there were striking parallels betweenthe racial separation in South African today and segregation in theUnited States during King's lifetime. A major difference, he said,was that the U.S. Constitution protects individual rights but SouthAfrican laws ``protect white privilege and white-minority rule.''   Mabuza said ``the black people in this country have realized thatthe oppressor will never voluntarily give freedom to the oppressed.The oppressed must demand that freedom.''   Perkins participated later in a ceremony at the U.S. consulate inDurban, where representatives of two feuding black politicalorganizations held hands during the singing of ``We Shall Overcome.''   Archie Gumede, co-president of the banned United DemocraticFront, held hands with Frank Mdlalose, a member of the Inkatha Zulupolitical group and a health minister in the KwaZulu black homelandgovernment. Supporters of Inkatha and the UDF have been fightingeach other in the Natal province townships for more than 18 months,resulting in more than 1,000 deaths.   Standing in the consulate garden overlooking the Indian Ocean,Perkins read most of King's ``Letter from a Birmingham Jail.''Blacks in the audience of about 200 murmured sympathetically atKing's description of police assaults on blacks.</TEXT></DOC>
