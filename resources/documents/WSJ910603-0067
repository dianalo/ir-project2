The main feature of the package was a new attempt, aftertwo previous failures at the polls, to introduce a so-calledvalue-added tax, or VAT, which is applied throughout the12-nation EC.</LP><TEXT>   Early returns in the national referendum showed thatmajorities in more than half the 26 cantons, or states, votedagainst the proposed constitutional amendment.   The vote had been widely considered a first importantpopular test of Switzerland's stance on European integration.The federal government has said that membership in theEuropean Community is the neutral nation's leading long-termoption if current talks on a looser relationship with the ECcollapse.   Under the Swiss system of direct democracy, the peoplewould have the final say on whether the country should jointhe EC.   All four government parties, the trade unions, and theSwiss bankers' association had backed the reform proposal.The VAT would have replaced the current turnover tax, withcoverage extended to include several service sectors, such asthe catering industry, travel agencies and hairdressers.   The turnover tax is levied as a proportion of the price ofa commodity on each sale in the production and distributionchain.   Under the terms of the reform package, Swiss banks, whichface growing competition from abroad, would have receivedsome relief in the form of a reduction in the stamp taxesimposed on various securities transactions.   The tax rate would have remained at 6.2%, the lowest ratein Western Europe, but approval of the reforms would haveallowed the government to increase it temporarily to 7.5% ifthe nation's social security system was ever jeopardized.   The blanket tax-boosting authority and the officialadmission that the reforms would temporarily increaseinflation, now at 5.9%, were among the reasons used byopponents such as the tiny Communist Party and theextreme-right Motorists Party to argue against the proposal.</TEXT></DOC>
