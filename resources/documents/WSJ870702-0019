Garcia</HL><DD> 07/02/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)STOCK INDEXES (NDX) </IN><TEXT>   The long Fourth of July holiday may have started early on Wall Street as stock prices sagged in sluggish trading yesterday.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 8.77 to 2409.76. The industrial average traded in a narrow band throughout the day, showing a loss of about 15 points at its lowest point.    The Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index eased 1.06 to 302.94, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index dropped 0.55 to 170.52.    Traders said many of their big institutional clients showed little interest in stocks yesterday. But few were bent on selling, they said.    As one trader in New York said, &quot;Institutions aren't doing much. There's no rush -- it's the first day of a new quarter and there's a long holiday weekend coming up.&quot;    The dollar and the bond market, which have been the guiding elements for the stock market through the second quarter, provided no help. The dollar was little changed and bond prices firmed, with lackluster trading in both markets.    Volume on the Big Board contracted to 157 million shares from 165.5 million shares Tuesday. Although stock prices were lower, the declines weren't widespread -- 658 issues advanced and 875 issues declined.    The stock market tends to move higher in the subdued trading right before a long holiday break. But this time, some analysts believe, the market might break with tradition.    Alfred Goldman, a technical analyst with A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons in St. Louis, believes investors might be doing &quot;a little anticipatory selling.&quot;    Last year, the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit record levels in some of the sessions right before the Fourth of July holiday. But Wall Street returned from the big weekend in a bearish mood, with stock prices plunging and the industrial average falling nearly 62 points -- then the biggest fall in its history.    Because investors are remembering last year's experience and are trying to prepare for it, Mr. Goldman believes, the stock market may end up doing just the opposite and could rise after the holiday.    Looking a bit beyond the holiday, he believes that the lethargic action in the market in the past few days suggests that the momentum that has carried stocks higher since late May &quot;has peaked.&quot; While rallies rarely stop on a dime, he said, he expects stock prices to slide later this month. He said the industrial average could flirt with 2200 again.    Reichhold Chemicals rose 2 3/8 to 63 1/8 on volume of 442,400 shares. The company rejected a $52.50-a-share tender offer from the Japanese firm Dainippon Ink andamp; Chemicals, saying it was inadequate.    Pay 'N Pak rose 3/8 to 21 1/4. Investor Paul Bilzerian submitted two new proposals to acquire the company, which he has been trying to buy for weeks.    Amgen sank 6 3/4 to 31 1/2 on more than 3.1 million shares in over-the-counter trading. Genetics Institute received a U.S. patent on erythropoietin, a promising drug that controls the production of red blood cells. Amgen was working to develop a similar product. Genetics Institute jumped 4 3/4 to 36 1/4.    Apollo Computer fell 7/8 to 19 3/8 in active trading. The company said a major federal contract for high-performance workstations was awarded to another bidder. The contract went to Sun Microsystems, which rose 1 3/8 to 38 5/8. Other computer stocks were mixed.    Santa Fe Southern Pacific moved up 2 1/4 to 52 1/4 in active trading. The stock rose 3 3/4 Tuesday after the federal government rejected the proposed Santa Fe-Southern Pacific merger and ordered the company to sell one of the two railroads.    Burlington Northern fell 2 5/8 to 80 1/8 and Kansas City Southern Industries dropped 3/8 to 53 3/8. Both expressed interest in bidding for one of the Santa Fe railroads.    Among other rail stocks, Union Pacific fell 1 1/8 to 77 1/4, CSX eased 1/4 to 34 5/8 and Norfolk Southern inched up 3/8 to 33 3/8.    Cyclops Industries rose 1 1/4 to 41. Alleghany distributed to shareholders all of the about 6.5 million shares in its Cyclops unit. Alleghany opened at 72 1/4 and closed at 76, but it was trading minus the distribution of the Cyclops shares. Alleghany fell 36 from its close Tuesday.    E.F. Hutton rose 2 5/8 to 40 3/4 in active trading. Takeover speculation about the brokerage firm resurfaced, with American Express and Yamaichi Securities of Toyko rumored as possible suitors.    Hutton and American Express spokesmen declined to comment. A Yamaichi spokesman in the U.S. said &quot;there was absolutely nothing to (the rumors)&quot; as far as he knew.    Southland rose 1 3/4 to 68 3/4 in heavy volume. Takeover rumors stirred up interest in the stock, traders said. It has been the target of such rumors in recent weeks.    Godfrey slid 3 3/4 to 29 1/2 in over-the-counter trading. Fleming agreed to acquire Godfrey for stock. Godfrey ran up a total of 7 1/2 Monday and Tuesday. Traders said some investors were looking for a higher bid to be made in cash.    GranTree rose 1 5/8 to 9 3/4. The company said it reached a definitive agreement on a leveraged buyout by investors led by Spectrum Group for $10 a share.    Financial Corp. of America sank 7/8 to 3 5/8 in active trading. The thrift anticipates a second-quarter net loss of between $150 million and $200 million for several reasons, including additions to reserves for losses on loans and real estate, recent changes in the interpretation of accounting rules and higher interest rates.    MBIA closed at 22, unchanged from its first trade but down 1 1/2 from its original offering price of $23.50. More than two million shares traded. An initial offering of 5.5 million shares was sold. MBIA insures municipal bonds through its unit, Municipal Bond Investors Assurance Corp.    Maytag fell 1/2 to 52 7/8 in heavy trading of more than 1.1 million shares. The company said it purchased more than one million of its shares yesterday as part of a stock buyback program approved by its board last November.    Niagara Mohawk was unchanged at 16 5/8. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved the company's application to operate the Nine Mile Point 2 nuclear plant at full power. The utility expects the plant will be in full operation by December or early 1988. Long Island Lighting and New York State Electric andamp; Gas each own 18% stakes in the plant. </TEXT></DOC>
