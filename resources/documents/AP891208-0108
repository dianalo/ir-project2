The increase in the civilian jobless rate from 5.3 percent to5.4 percent came despite the addition of 210,000 non-farm jobs lastmonth because of a big jump in the number of Americans looking forwork.   The stock market reacted favorably to the data, taking evidenceof sluggishness as an indication the Federal Reserve would seek tospur the economy by easing its hold on credit before the end of theyear, thus lowering interest rates.   The 210,000 new non-farm jobs reported by the Labor Departmentwas in itself a moderately strong number, but the government alsosharply cut its job growth figures for October from 233,000 to93,000.   That brought the average month-to-month job gain for the secondhalf of the year to about 160,000 _ well off the average monthlygain of 270,000 for the previous 2{ years. All of the new jobs havebeen in the service side of the economy; manufacturing employmentis down 165,000 since March.   ``What it means is the economy is weaker than we had previouslythought,'' said Elliott Platt, a senior vice president atDonaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp. ``We're not in arecession yet but we're perilously close in this quarter andprobably going to be perilously close in the first quarter nextyear.''   Indeed, chief economist Allen Sinai at Boston Co. EconomicAdvisers said the economy might already be in recession and at bestwas ``near and certainly headed'' for one.   They and others predicted the Fed would relax its credit policy,but not all analysts shared that view.   ``The economy is kind of moving along in second gear,'' saidMichael Evans, head of a Washington forecasting firm. ``It's notvery weak and it's not very strong. I don't think these numberssuggest further easing.''   The unemployment rate has not been 5.4 percent since January.The increase came despite the job growth because the civilian laborforce _ those looking for work and those with jobs _ grew by410,000 to 124.5 million, with 117.7 million of them holding jobs.   The Labor Department said the huge revision of the Octoberjob-growth figure stemmed from overestimating the number ofteaching and other school jobs added this fall. That revisioncontributed to the reported decline in the number of localgovernment jobs last month.   Elsewhere in the service sector, which has been carrying theeconomy, wholesale and retail trade posted gains of 18,000 and33,000 jobs, respectively, health services added 40,000 positionsand business services added 13,000 positions.   Employment in business services dipped in October and manyanalysts interpreted the only modest rebound in November asevidence that demand for temporary workers, janitorial and otherservices might be slipping because of the manufacturing slump.   The department said manufacturing employment was down 27,000 inNovember _ with all but 3,000 of the decline coming in thedurable-goods sector. The biggest problem area there is inautomobile manufacturing, which lost 15,000 jobs last month afterlosing 10,000 in October.   Adding to evidence of a severe manufacturing slump, thegovernment said the average factory work week fell from 40.8 to40.7 hours and overtime was unchanged at an average of 3.7 hours aweek.   Mining and construction reported modest employment gains lastmonth, adding 7,000 and 17,000 positions, respectively.   The Fed has been trying to encourage economic growth withoutexacerbating inflation, and Friday's report contained someencouraging data on that front.   Average hourly earnings were unchanged in November, and averageweekly earnings declined by 0.4 percent.   But analysts cautioned against reading too much into the monthlywage numbers, noting that throughout the year there has been asharp upswing in the first month of each quarter followed by a flator moderate increase the following month.   The unemployment rates among major demographic groups were:   _Adult white men, 4.0 percent, up from 3.8 percent in October.   _Adult white women, 4.0 percent, unchanged.   _White teen-agers, 11.2 percent, up from 10.4 percent.   _All blacks, 12.1 percent, up from 11.8 percent.   _Adult black men, 10.7 percent, up from 10.3 percent.   _Adult black women, 10.4 percent, up from 10 percent.   _Black teen-agers, 32.8 percent, down from 34.2 percent.   _Hispanics, 7.8 percent, down from 7.9 percent.   In a separate calculation of unemployment that counts members ofthe armed forces stationed in the United States, the Novemberunemployment rate was 5.3 percent, up from 5.2 percent in October.</TEXT></DOC>
