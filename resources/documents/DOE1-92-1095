Exposure of PCB to a building fire can occur when Askarel-containingtransformers are present at the fire site. Recognition of the risks posedby formation of PCDF/PCDD has prompted most utilities to remove PCB fromactive service by either replacing or retrofilling existing appliances.To demonstrate the environmental safety of a recently designed facilityfor handling large amounts of PCB, a Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA)demonstration test was conducted in September 1986. This paper describesthe sampling and analytical procedures that were used to measure PCDF/PCDDlevels in the liquid process streams handled at the plant and gaseousemissions generated in the decontamination process. Results demonstratethe sensitivity and reliability of ultratrace sampling and analysis methodsfor these levels. 2 references, 2 figures, 6 tables.</TEXT></DOC>
