Czeslaw Kiszczak as prime minister means very little change.   Before the presidential election July 19, the three mostimportant officials were Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, Mieczyslaw F.Rakowski and Kiszczak, the interior minister.   On Wednesday, after the government and Communist Party moveswere completed, the three most important figures were Jaruzelski,Rakowski and Kiszczak.   Now they have different job titles and roles, but the same teamis in place for the Communist Party to continue its contradictorypolicy of ``agreement and struggle'' with the reborn Solidaritytrade union movement.   The party needs agreement with the opposition to cure Poland'seconomic problems. But the party also needs to fight with theopposition for the hearts and minds of at least a part of thepopulation.   Jaruzelski, the author of the policy who has resigned asCommunist Party leader, assumed the newly strengthened office ofpresident with ultimate control of the military and foreignrelations. He is a guarantee to Poland's communist neighbors thatmoves toward democracy demanded by Solidarity won't bring anysudden change in the country's loyalty to the Soviet Union andWarsaw Pact.   He was Poland's top leader before, and he retains that power now.   In addition, he has prolonged his time in power. Party ruleswould have required him to step down as leader after the next partycongress in 1990. Now, he can hold the office of president at leastuntil 1995.   Rakowski, whom Solidarity leaders would like to impeach foralleged mismanagement of the economy during his nine months asprime minister, moves over to Jaruzelski's old office at partyheadquarters.   A strong-willed player of political hardball, he riled theopposition early in his administration with his decision to closeSolidarity's birthplace, the Lenin Shipyard in Gdansk. He riled itagain at the end of his term with spectacular increases in foodprices.   According to one Central Committee member quoted during theparty debate on Rakowski's candidacy, public confidence in thegovernment fell by half during his tenure.   Now that Solidarity holds a good chunk of the National Assembly_ control of the 100-member Senate and 35 percent of the Sejm _ theprime minister by necessity must be able to work with the union.Always more of a fighter than conciliator, Rakowski did not fit thejob description.   In key ways, however, he does fit the needs of the party, itsself-confidence and fighting spirit deflated as the result of itscrushing losses to Solidarity in the June parliamentary elections.Rakowski's most important trait is that he will get the party ``upoff its knees,'' a party spokesman said this week.   Enter Kiszczak. As interior minister since 1981 in charge of anarmy of uniformed and secret police, he knows the opposition betterthan anyone else in government. His agents tapped their telephonesand collected their illegal publications.   During two waves of strikes last year, Kiszczak opened channelsof communication to the opposition and called for the talks thatevolved into the historic ``round-table'' accords that legalizedSolidarity and led to the country's first democratic electionssince World War II.   As head of the police, he had credibility with Solidarity as anegotiating partner and did not risk appearing too soft to hiscolleagues when he made concessions.   In nominating Kiszczak to head the government after Rakowski,Jaruzelski emphasized his proven ability at the round table toreach agreements. Speaking of his relationship with Solidarityleader Lech Walesa last month, Kiszczak himself acknowledged thesame.   ``We differ in many respects and yet, so far, we have alwaysmanaged to come to an agreement when matters of crucial agreementwere concerned,'' he said. ``And this is what counts most.''   Although the job switches undoubtedly suit the current needs ofJaruzelski and the Communist Party, they are bound to disappointmany Poles who expected dramatic changes when they voted in 260 outof 261 Solidarity candidates during the parliamentary elections.   In the end, the same people will be in charge.   ``What kind of new government is that supposed to be?'' said adisgruntled lawmaker from the communist-allied Peasant Party.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   John Daniszewski, the AP correspondent inWarsaw, has covered Poland since 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
