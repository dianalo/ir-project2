The purpose of this action is to promulgate the section of thatregulatory system that permits transfers of allowances (40 CFR 82.12).The regulation promulgated today requires any firm wishing to transferallowances to submit a transfer claim to EPA and substantiate that it hasthe allowances it wishes to transfer. Depending on whether EPA's recordsconfirm that the transferring firm has the allowances, the Agency willissue a notice of no objection to the transfer or a notice disallowingthe transfer. In certain instances, EPA will issue a notice of no objection,but request further information from the transferor. In any event, theAgency will act within three working days of receiving a firm's completetransfer claim.EPA is also considering whether to substitute for the transfer rule promulgatedtoday a system based on certificates or coupons that would not requirethe Agency to determine whether the transferor has sufficient allowances.The Agency is requesting comments on this sytsem.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>This final rule will take effect upon entry into forceof the Montreal Protocol.

Background Information </ITAG>On August 12, 1988, EPA issued its final rule (53 FR 30566) implementingthe Montreal Protocol, an international treaty designed to limit the worldwideproduction and consumption of chloroflourocarbons (CFCs) and halons. The rule requires CFC producers to reduce their production of CFC-11, -12,-113, -114, -115 (``controlled substances'') by as much as 50 percent of1986 levels over the next 10 years. The schedule of the phased reductionsin CFC production is presented in the August 12 final rule (andSection; 82.7).In addition to these production limits, the rule requires reduction inCFC consumption, defined as production plus imports minus exports, accordingto the same schedule (andSection; 82.7). The rule also limits the production and consumption of Halon 1301, 1211,and 2402, another set of ozone-depleting chemicals. Under the rule, productionand consumption of these halons will be frozen at 1986 levels beginningin approximately 1992 (andSection; 82.8). The Agency's August 12 final rule implements these limits by allottingproduction and consumption allowances to producers and importers (andSection;andSection;82.5 and 82.6). Producers must obtain both consumption and production allowancesto manufacture controlled substances while importers need only consumptionallowances to import. Under the August 12 final rule seven producers receivedproduction allowances and seventeen producers and importers received consumptionallowances for these chemicals based on the 1986 production and trade datathey submitted to the Agency (andSection;andSection; 82.5 and 82.6). To monitor compliance by industry with these production and consumptionlimits, EPA requires that producers and importers maintain records of theirproduction and import activities and report quarterly their productionand import levels (andSection; 82.13). EPA may also conduct compliance reviewsand inspections. In addition, EPA requires exporters to report their exportshipments for which they may receive additional consumption allowances(andSection;andSection; 82.10, 82.11 and 82.13). As EPA stated in the preambles to its proposed and final rules, the Agencyintended that consumption, production, authorizations to convert potentialproduction allowances and potential production allowances \1\<NOTE/> be transferable to improve the efficiency of its regulatorysystem. With the addition of the transfer section promulgated today, theregulations permit producers and importers either to use their allowancesto produce or import controlled substances, or to trade their allowancesto other companies which could, in turn, produce or import the chemicalsor trade the allowances. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ (Companies receive potential production allowances conditionsspecified in andSection; 82.9 of the August 14 final rule and can convertpotential production allowances to production allowances when EPA grantsan authorization under conditions specified in andSection; 82.11.)In either case, the company must notify EPA of its activities. If a companyproduces or imports the controlled substances or trades the allowancesneeded to produce or import that company must report quarterly to EPA.This quarterly reporting requirement is specified in andSection; 82.13 ofthe final rule. EPA did not promulgate the transfer section with the rest of the finalrule pending further review of that provision. EPA has completed this reviewand today issues andSection; 82.12 which details the requirements for companiesthat intend to trade allowances. EPA has benefitted, in developing andSection;82.12, from comments submitted in response to the proposed rule publishedon December 14, 1987. In addition to these comments, EPA has consultedwith industry trade groups and other government agencies in developingthis section. The section set forth today provides for prompt processing of transferclaims that will help the U.S. avoid exceeding the production and consumptionlimits set by the Montreal Protocol. Notification of an intended tradethrough a transfer claim will allow the Agency to review the availabilityof allowances for trading. Review of transfer claims will also providea check on the validity of allowances and prevent possible counterfeitingof allowances and fraudulent trades. Further, a system of EPA review willreduce uncertainty that could otherwise discourage firms from trading.EPA believes that only through a system of transfer claims can EPA trackadditional firms which were not allocated allowances initially but whichmay enter the trading market to obtain allowances. Without notificationof such trades EPA would be unable to monitor U.S. compliance with theProtocol and could not resolve future trades between the third party firmand another firm. When EPA evaluates compliance at the end of each controlperiod, knowledge of these third party trades becomes important if companieswhich received traded allowances are found in noncompliance. Finally, submission of transfer claims to EPA may prevent companies frominadvertently trading allowances they do not have. This is most likelyto occur during the last quarter of the control period during which EPAis aware, through quarterly reports and compliance inspections, of thelevel or likely level of unexpected allowances available for trade. A reviewof reported allowances, including those traded, against EPA records wouldprevent inadvertent exceedances of production and consumption limits. EPAbelieves that it is during this period that trades are most likely to occuras companies alter production plans and import activities to ensure compliancewith their production and consumption allowances. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Response to Comments </ITAG>Comments to the December 14 proposed rule expressed concern that approvalby EPA of trades may interfere with the free trade of allowances. Commentersbelieved that andSection; 82.12, as proposed, provided EPA with the roleof approving or disapproving the trades and of acting potentially as athird party within the trade negotiations. This was not EPA's intention.In response to this concern, EPA refers to ``transfer claims'' insteadof ``transfer requests'' within the final andSection; 82.12. This changeis intended to clarify that EPA's role is to keep track of trades and toverify that allowances are sufficient. EPA, acting in a fashion similarto a commercial bank, will disallow transfers if the seller's account showsinsufficient balances to effect the transfer. EPA is also aware of industry's concern that the Agency will not reviewthe transfer claim quickly and could, through delay, disrupt the supplyof the chemicals to necessary markets. It is common practice for a companywhich cannot produce enough chemicals to fill orders to seek to obtainthe chemical from another producer. In that situation a trade of allowanceswould occur. Producers were concerned that EPA may not be able to processthe request for transfer quickly enough, thus hindering the supply of thesechemicals to consumers. EPA believes that most transactions will involvesales or purchases of the chemicals themselves and not of allowances. Nonetheless,in response to this concern, EPA will respond to transfer claims withinthree working days of receipt of a complete claim by the Chief, Regulationsand Analysis Branch, Global Change Division, the Office of Air and Radiation.Three working days are necessary given the uncertainty as to the numberof claims that will be filed, the need to review and assess multiple reportsor claims, and in some cases to evaluate apparent discrepancies. The Agencyintends to take action in fewer than three days whenever possible. Electronic ReportingTo expedite processing and review, EPA encourages firms to submit theirtransfer claims electronically. By sending reports electronically, firmswould be able to avoid delays inherent in using the mail system and possiblemis-direction of the request within the Agency. A firm reporting electronicallymay submit the transfer request through electronic mail, spread sheet,electronic facsimile or through a computer prompt system established byEPA. Although EPA has not mandated electronic reporting, the Agency believesthat such a reporting system will provide for a more immediate responseby EPA to the transfer claim and reduce the need to establish an extensivefiling system by EPA and the firm for hard copy claims.Although EPA encourages firms to report electronically, firms may submittransfer claims through the U.S. mail or a commercial carrier. Ordinarily,it may take one to two days for a letter to reach the Global Change Division,once the submission is delivered to the EPA headquarters. The three workingday response time begins when a completed submission is received by theChief of the Regulation and Analysis Branch, the Global Change Division,within the Office of Air and Radiation. Completeness is to be determinedby the Chief of the Regulations and Analysis Branch. The Agency will developa system to receive both electronic and hard copy submissions and outlineprocedures for submission by firms in a guidance document to be availablebefore the beginning of the first control period.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Penalties</ITAG>Companies submitting or using fraudulent transfer claims are subject tostringent penalties. Companies producing or importing based on fraudulentallowances obtained through a trade would be subject to a penalty undersection 113(b) of the Clean Air Act of up to $25,000 per kilogram of controlledsubstances produced or consumed in excess of the legitimate number of allowancesheld by that company. Transferring allowances without submission of properclaim under andSection; 82.12 constitutes a reporting violation on the partof the transferor subject to a maximum penalty of $25,000 per violationunder section 113(b) of the Clean Air Act. Any person who knowingly misrepresentsany required information under andSection; 82.12 would upon conviction besubject to a maximum fine of $10,000 and/or imprisonment of not more than6 months under section 113(c)(2) of the Clean Air Act. Selling or tradingfraudulent allowances would expose the seller or trader to liability under18 U.S.C. 1001, which prohibits supplying false information to the UnitedStates government. Maximum penalties under this section are $10,000 orfive years imprisonment or both. In addition, such companies are guiltyof mail fraud under 18 U.S.C. 1341 which carries a potential penalty of$1,000 per occurrence or five years imprisonment or both. Producers andimporters which trade allowances and produce or import in excess of theirremaining balance of allowances may be penalized for each kilogram in excessof the allowances they still hold. The maximum penalty for excess productionor consumption is $25,000 per kilogram.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Changes to the Proposed Rule</ITAG>Section 82.12 of the December 14, 1987 proposed rule required companiesintending to trade these allowances to submit a ``transfer request'' toEPA for approval. The proposed rule required that the transferring companysubmit the following information for review by the Agency: The identitiesand addresses of the transferor and the transferee; the names and telephonenumbers of the contact persons; the type of right or allowances (i.e. productionallowances, consumption allowances, or potential production allowances)or authorization being transferred; the group of controlled substancesto which the rights are being transferred; the amount of the rights orauthorization being transferred; the control period for which the rightsor authorization are being transferred; and the amount of unexpended rightsor allowances of the type and for the control period being transferredthat the transferor holds as of the date of the request. The proposed rulestated that the Agency would review the current balances of the firm requestingthe transfer or trade and issue a notice of transfer if a sufficient balanceof unexpended rights or allowances existed to cover the trade.Section 82.12 of the final rule requires similar information from the companytrading the allowances. This information is important for EPA to evaluatethe trade and to contact company representatives if discrepancies occur.However, as previously discussed, EPA has modified the proposed sectionin some areas. The final rule refers to transfer ``claims'' rather thantransfer ``requests'', thus emphasizing that EPA's role is limited to reviewingand determining if sufficient balances exist for a trade rather than asa third party actively involved in the approval of transfers between thecompanies.EPA has revised subsection (b) to state that the Agency will determinewhether its records indicate that the transferor possesses unexpended allowancesor authorizations sufficient to cover the transfer claim. That subsectionalso provides that within three working days of receiving a complete transferclaim, the Agency will take action to notify the transferor and transfereethat its records show (1) that the transferor has either sufficient orinsufficient allowances or authorizations to cover the claim or (2) thatits records are inadequate to make this determination.Where EPA's records show that the transferor has insufficient allowancesor authorizations to cover the transfer, or that the transferor has failedto respond to the Agency's request for information to determine the transferor'scurrent balance, EPA's notice will disallow the transfer. Within ten workingdays of receiving a notice of disallowing the transfer, the transferoror transferee may appeal the disallowance to the Director of the Officeof Atmospheric and Indoor Air Programs in the Office of Air and Radiation.If no appeal is taken, the disallowance will be final on that day.Where EPA's records indicate that the transferor has sufficient allowancesor authorizations to cover the transfer or if review of EPA's records showsthat available information is insufficient to make a determination, EPAwill issue a notice stating that EPA does not object to the transfer. WhenEPA issues a no objection notice, the transferor or transferee may proceedwith the transfer. Transferees may not proceed to produce or consume inaccordance with the transfer claim until EPA has had three working daysto review the complete transfer claim. If EPA does not issue a notice withinthree working days, transferors and transferees may proceed to produceor consume in accordance with the transfer at their own risk. EPA's failureto object to the transfer does not represent a final determination thatthe transfer is valid, however. Accordingly, a no objection notice is notfinal agency action reviewable in court. See, <T3>District of Columbia </T3>v. <T3>Schramm, </T3>631 F. 2d 854, 859-862 (DC Cir., 1980); <T3>Save the Bay Inc. </T3>v. <T3>EPA, </T3>556 F. 2d 1282, 1290-1292 (5th Cir., 1977). By the same token,the failure to object would not bar a subsequent enforcement action if,for example, EPA later finds that the transaction was improper.EPA may ask for additional information where the EPA has not received thequarterly report due under andSection; 82.13 of this part or where the reporthas been received but appears to be inadequate. In addition, discrepanciesmay occur within quarterly reports, compliance reports, or trading claimsfiled by EPA. Where EPA receives a trading claim under such circumstances,EPA will issue a no objection claim but will request that the trading firmssupply the requested information expeditiously. Failure to respond to requestsmay lead to disallowance of future transfer claims submitted by these firms.EPA has also added subsection (c) which provides that if the Agency failsto respond to a transfer claim within three working days of receiving it,the transferor and transferee may proceed with the transfer. However, thatsubsection also states that the transferor and transferee would still beliable for any violations of the regulations of this part if EPA laterdetermined that the transferor had insufficient allowances to cover thetrade. In this respect, transfers completed before the Agency respondedto the transfer claim would be treated like transfers to which the Agencyissues a notice of no objection.Finally, transferors and transferees should act prudently so as not toexceed available allowances or authorizations. If EPA ultimately findsthat the transferor lacked sufficient allowances to cover the claim, thetransferor and transferee will be held liable for any violation of theregulations that occur as a result of the improper transfer.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Coupon Tracking System</ITAG>The Agency today is requesting comments on an approach to streamline furtherthe trading requirements outlined in andSection; 82.12 of the final rule.A coupon system would eliminate the need for trading companies to notifyEPA of transfer claims when the trade occurs. Under a coupon system, EPAwould provide coupons representing their full allotment of allowances toproducers and importers. Each coupon would entitle the holder to produceor import a certain level of controlled substances. Once a specified quantityof controlled substance was produced or imported, then coupons representingthat level of production and consumption would be submitted to EPA. Thesesubmissions would either occur when the production or consumption occurredor quarterly. EPA would continue to maintain production and import recordsand require quarterly reporting as outlined in andSection; 82.13 of the finalrule.As part of a trading transaction, a company would physically transfer thecoupons representing the traded allowances to the recipient company. Companieswould not be required to notify the Agency of the trade immediately orrequire approval. Once the allowances were consumed by the recipient, thecoupons would be sent to EPA or maintained on site for compliance inspections.EPA believes that a coupon system may facilitate allowance trading amongfirms. However, several issues and concerns must be resolved. First, theissue of counterfeiting of coupons (e.g. where a recipient firm must becertain that it receives authentic coupons) must be examined. Another issueinvolves whether the Agency should monitor the activities of new firmswhich enter the market to receive and trade allowances. Absent counterfeitingproblems, such monitoring may not be necessary. EPA is requesting commentson these issues as well as the general structure of the coupon trackingsystem.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>The information collection requirements contained in this rule as wellas all reporting and recordkeeping requirements contained in the finalrule promulgated on August 12, 1988, 53 FR 30566, have been approved bythe Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of the <T3>Paperwork Reduction Act, </T3>44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq. </T3>and have been assigned OMB control number 2060-0170.Reporting burden associated with the preparation and submittal of allowancetransfer claims is estimated to be 2 hours per submittal (on average),including time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources,gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewingthe collection of information.Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of thiscollection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden,to Chief, Information Policy Branch, PM-223, U.S. Environmental ProtectionAgency, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office of Informationand Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork ReductionProject (2060-0170), Washington, DC 20530, marked ``Attention: Desk Officerfor EPA.''<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: February 2, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jack Moore,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Acting Administrator.</ITAG>For the reasons set forth in the preamble, Title 40 Part 82 is amendedto read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 82_PROTECTION OF STRATOSPHERIC OZONE</ITAG>1.
