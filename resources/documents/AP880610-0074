Police in the center of Seoul chased thousands of screamingstudents trying to reach the main train station to take trains tothe border. About 5,000 bottled up by police in Yonsei Universitytried to force their way out.   ``We fight for unification,'' students chanted as they tried tobreak through police lines to make their way to the border 30 milesnorth of Seoul.   Police hit by firebombs screamed with pain as they wereenveloped in orange flames in the fighting around Yonsei. Studentswielding wooden and iron clubs beat troopers trying to ward offblows with shields. Both sides pelted each other with rocks andbricks.   Black police armored cars fired volley after volley of chokingtear gas into the charging students, and police martial arts squadscounterattacked. Students tried to immobilize the vans withfirebombs and clubs.   Police arrested more than 500 students in various parts ofSeoul, and about 40 students who managed to reach Imjingak at theedge of the Demilitarized Zone along the border were immediatelydetained.   Police battled several thousand students who held demonstrationsto support the reunification march in the provincial cities ofTaejon, Iri, Chunju, Chonan and Kongju. Troopers fired tear gas todrive protesters back into college campuses as students hurledfirebombs and rocks.   Protesters at one point dragged a 20-foot baseball backstop tothe main gate at Yonsei to deflect exploding gas bombs fired bypolice. But riot troopers attacked and dragged it away.   Dozens were injured at the university, but authorities had nooverall figures. Police officers and students with burns or bloodpouring from cuts were carried away or staggered to safety. Astudent hit in the head by a teargas shell was in criticalcondition.   Radical students called for the march to force reunification ofthe communist north and the pro-Western south. Radicals claim theUnited States enforces partition of the Korean peninsula to rulethe south, and the protests were vehemently anti-American.   ``Yankee go home'' and ``Skin the Yankees,'' screamed thestudents.   About 60,000 riot police in green combat fatigues and helmetswere deployed in Seoul and on roads leading to the border to blockthe march, banned by the government as a national security risk.   Police guarded train and bus stations to stop students fromslipping through to the border. Riot squads ringed governmentbuildings and U.S. diplomatic facilities to prevent attacks.   Riot squads seized dozens of students in clashes around therailway station. Some students hurled rocks, but most did not fightback as charging police roughly scattered marchers.   Officers were seen brutally punching and kicking students asthey dragged them away. Blood poured from faces of beaten students.   Pedestrians ran for cover or choked and coughed from swirlingtear gas. The running clashes repeatedly brought traffic to astandstill on many main streets.   Fighting erupted around Yonsei today when students attempted tomarch out after a rally at which speakers called for reunificationand denounced the United States. A giant picture of an enragedstudent slashing a U.S. flag was used as a backdrop.   ``We call for struggle of the masses for unification and againstdictatorship,'' a speaker shouted as cheering students waved red,blue and black anti-government and anti-U.S. banners.   Students attacked riot police with firebombs as they marched outof the sprawling campus in the west of Seoul ringed by about 8,000troopers. Other students in nearby sidestreets tried to attackpolice from the rear and seized several high rooftops.   Radical leaders said two representatives were sent to slip pastpolice blocks and reach the border truce site of Panmunjom to meetwith the northern delegates. The heavily-militarized border is offlimits to all civilians.   The North Korean government Korean Central News Agency said in areport monitored in Tokyo that the north's delegates and manystudents had reached Panmunjom and were waiting. The delegateswould be government appointees.   ``The student delegation from our side is now waiting for themoment when it will have an emotion-charged meeting with fellowstudents from the south,'' the report said.   Most South Koreans oppose the radicals' reunification drive.People fear the totalitarian north is as determined to conquer thesouth as it was when it invaded in 1950 to start the Korean War.   The radicals, a small but powerful minority on campuses, claimreunfication overrides any ideological considerations. Radicalsdemand expulsion of the 42,000 U.S. troops based in the south undera mutual defense treaty.   The South Korean government says the radicals are pro-communistor idealists who risk being used by the north. It insists it aloneshould handle contacts with the north and the mainline oppositionparties opposed the student march.</TEXT></DOC>
