The president spoke before a hastily assembled crowd at aceremony at the Iwo Jima Memorial, the statue of five Marinesraising the flag on a Pacific island during World War II.   Bush used the ceremony to register his support for aRepublican-drafted proposed amendment that asserts: ``The Congressand the states shall have power to prohibit the physical desecrationof the flag of the United States.''   ``This flag is one of our most powerful ideas,'' Bush declared.``If it is not defended, it is defamed ... it represents the fabricof our nation.''   Bush said the statue behind him, a huge bronze casting of aphotograph by Associated Press photographer Joe Rosenthal, was``stunning ... even now it humbles us, inspires us.''   Bush said the amendment drafted by Republican congressionalleaders with the support of some Democrats was ``simple, stark andto-the-point.''   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas praised Bush forsupporting the amendment and called it ``a serious step'' tocircumvent last week's 5-4 Supreme Court ruling that said flagburning is a form of free expression protected by the Constitution.   Dole said that people across the nation were speaking out againstthe ruling. ``People are saying, keep your hands off Old Glory,'' hesaid.   Also speaking at the ceremony were co-sponsors of the amendment,House Republican leader Robert Michel of Illinois and two Democrats,Sen. Alan Dixon of Illinois and Rep. Sonny Montgomery ofMississippi, chairman of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee.   Bush announced his support for a constitutional amendmentforbidding flag-desecration at a news conference on Tuesday.Although aides at first said the president would present his ownversion of such an amendment, he later decided to join forces withcongressional leaders.   Michel said today's ceremony at the monument adjoining ArlingtonNational Ceremony ``begins the process of protecting our flag.''   The House leader said the amendment, which needs approval bytwo-thirds margins in both House and Senate and then ratification by38 state legislatures to take effect, ``seeks to protect the flag,nothing more.''   The president said the flag, flying over ``farm houses and statehouses, schools and courts and capitals, is borne on the breeze offreedom.''   ``The surest way to protect liberty is to protect the spirit thatsustains it,'' he said.   Bush denied he was acting in a partisan fashion in pressing hiscampaign for the flag amendment. ``Patriotism is not a partisanissue, it is not a political issue,'' he told the audience, made upmostly of administration officials and Republican members ofCongress.   Both Democrats and Republicans have publicly deplored the SupremeCourt decision, but a spokesman for the Democratic NationalCommittee accused Bush of using the issue for political opportunism.   ``He's running for president instead of being president,'' MikeMcCurry, DNC communications director, said Wednesday. ``The heroesof Iwo Jima didn't die so they could become a backdrop for somepolitical photo opportunity.''   Bush used the flag ceaselessly in his presidential campaign lastyear. He visited a flag factory and attacked Democrat MichaelDukakis, the Massachusetts governor, for vetoing as unconstitutionala bill requiring the Pledge of Allegiance to be recited in schools.   House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., introduced theresolution Thursday before the House adjourned for its holidayrecess.   Michel said he expects Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole ofKansas to introduce it there when that chamber returns from itsextended Fourth of July holiday, which began last week.   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said Thursday the HouseJudiciary Committee will begin hearings on the flag issue in July.   Foley, while condemning flag burning, has urged caution aboutamending the Constitution. Michel said he generally agrees, butbelieves such action is the only answer in this case.   ``I just have to assume we're not going to be thwarted,'' hesaid, insisting he did not view the issue as a Republican attempt topaint the Democrats as less patriotic.   Montgomery joined Michel in introducing the resolution.   Michel said the amendment avoids specific methods of desecrationbecause any list might leave one out. He pointed out, however, thatthe amendment referred only to physical desecration in order toavoid hampering free expression.</TEXT></DOC>
