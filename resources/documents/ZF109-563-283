Wireless Plc's Cable andamp; Wireless Communications Inc is to automate itscircuit design functions with TecNet/Design, a new circuit provisioningsystem launched by Cincinnati Bell Information Systems earlier this year:Cables, which is the only US company other than ATandamp;T to design its ownnetwork architecture and switching technology, was designing an in-housecircuit provisioning system when Cincinnati asked it to serve as theTecNet/Design beta site - Cables accepted the offer as a cost-effectivealternative and was first in line to purchase the system when it was formallyintroduced; TecNet/Design is conceived to aid in determining optimum circuitroutes and automatically assigning facilities and equipment and enables usersto customise design rules and variables unique to the company.andM;- o -andM;In one of the stranger announcements of nuptuals, Sunnyvale, California basedWestern Microwave Inc says that it has &quot;entered into a definitive agreementand plan of merger with Dr Ibrahim Hefni, the company's acting chiefexecutive and a director&quot;: it sounds decidedly uncomfortable having to goaround merged with a company, but Dr Hefni has offered $2 a share for all theshares outstanding; he and Microwave Engineering Corp, where he is ashareholder and director, presently hold 18.6% of Western.andM;- o -andM;Fremont, California-based Sigma Designs Inc is to integrate its proprietarycircuitry used to reduce the electromagnetic field radiation typical to allcathode ray tube-based monitors and display systems into each of itsmonochrome and grayscale display products, without increasing their prices.andM;- o -andM;Stac Electronics Inc, of Carlsbad, California has come out with a datacompression system which it says enables users to double the effectivecapacity of Winchesters on MS-DOS micros: Stacker is claimed to providereal-time lossless compression, reducing most personal computer users' datato half its original volume, with compressions as high as 15:1 or more insome cases, Stac says, noting that real-time means that the compression anddecompression process occurs continuously, totally transparent to the user;it comes as software for laptop, notebook and Micro Channel-based computers;with an add-in board for XT- and AT-alikes; and in co-processors for computermanufacturers to incorporate into new systems; the software version is a 30Kbprogram that can be loaded into high memory using a memory manager utility;the co-processor board goes into an AT slot; the software version is $130,with a coupon entitling the holder to buy the board later for $100; it costs$230 with the board, and both will be available next month in the US.andM;- o -andM;Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based Encore Computer Corp says it has&quot;substantially enhanced&quot; its relationship with Ingres Corp, signing a&quot;strategic account relationship agreement&quot; under which Ingres will now selland support its products on Encore's Multimax parallel multiprocessorcomputers worldwide, and continuously tune, enhance and update its productsfor the Encore machines - so Encore has shipped Multimax systems to Ingres'world headquarters in Alameda, California and to the European headquarters inLondon; Ingres Release 6 is now certified for the Encore Multimax.andM;- o -andM;Legent Corp, Vienna, Virginia is to buy in up to 1m more of its own shares:the company has aleady bought in 800,000 under the programme that itinitiated in April; at September 30, the company's cash and near cashtotalled some $85m.andM;- o -andM;Fujitsu Systems of America, San Diego has introduced the Atrium9000Primary/88, an 8088-based point-of-sale terminal: it runs MS-DOS and usesmost of the modular hardware components such as cash drawer, displays,printers, as the 80286-based model; it will be out this quarter but no pricewas given.andM;- o -andM;Dun andamp; Bradstreet Software has launched Human Resources DB2, which itdescribes as integrated relational payroll and personnel packagesspecifically designed to provide users with precise and easy access to allpersonnel information: it has been completely redesigned to take fulladvantage of native IBM DB2 database capabilities, Dun says, including setprocessing, concurrent processing and referential integrity; it will beavailable in December: components start at $150,000.andM;- o -andM;And Dun andamp; Bradstreet Software has announced FrontLine ViewBuilder, a personalcomputer development tool designed to enable users to build stand-alone orco-operative processing applications: it runs on a PS/2 so is presumably anOS/2 program though Dun doesn't say, and is claimed to work with any hostsystem using the 3270 communications environment, including the DEC VAX; it'savailable now at from $30,000.andM;- o -andM;Unisys Corp has introduced the IR 9210 Courtesy Amount Reader module, ahand-print and machine-print recognition system for financial documentsprocessed the company's InfoImage Image Item Processing System: the optionalmodule, developed with Siemens AG's Computer Gesellschaft Konstanz mbH,recognizes the hand-written or machine-printed numeric amount on cheques,which in banking parlours is apparently known as the courtesy amount orconvenience amount; the module is about $250,000.andM;- o -andM;Irvine, California-based Meridian Software Systems Inc has launched AdaZ,described as the first validated, non-restricted, fully featured Adadevelopment system to be offered for under $500: the company says it has aprogramming environment and tool set similar to many widely-used langaugessuch as Turbo Pascal and Microsoft C, and an MS-DOS like programmingenvironment designed for &quot;exceptional ease of use&quot;, via a menu-driven,multiwindowed interface, from which any tool or compiler operation can beinvoked; the package includes the Ada Compiler Environment; a menu driven,multiwindow interface integrated with the compilation system; the MS-DOSenvironment library; a language sensitive editor; on-line language referencemanual; set of development tools including automatic recompilation tool;source level Ada-specific debugger; library management tools; utilitylibraries; graphics interface; and &quot;friendly&quot; documentation; it needs MS-DOS2.1 up, 640Kb and hard disk and is available till Christmas at $150, afterwhich it goes to $500.andM;- o -andM;US Sprint Communications Co is to market Electronic Data Interchange systemsto large-scale network service providers worldwide, and suggests that itsservice can be used by PTTs to offer public Data Interchange services intheir countries, as they use US Sprint Telenet data network systems toprovide their own public network services: the system system supports &quot;allmajor EDI protocols and mainframe, mini and personal computer interconnectioncapabilities; major companies can interconnect the personal computers oftheir trading partners onto a corporate EDI network via a fully functionalMS-DOS package they can install themselves; the system is based on TandemComputers Inc machines and the core software was developed by Harbinger*EDIServices Inc, of Atlanta, Georgia.andM;- o -andM;DSM Computersysteme GmbH, Munich, Germany has launched the SPC-860 80860RISC-based co-processor for iAPX-86-based micros running Unix, OS/2 orMS-DOS: the company claims the board, which has four Transputer links toconnect to other boards of the same kind, can be addressed as a parallelprocessor, and up to 256 of the boards can be linked to create a parallelsystem theoretically capable of delivering 20 GFLOPS if only all the nodescould be made to go bang simultaneously; the thing comes with an 80860cross-assembler that runs underMS-DOS; no prices were available.andM;- o -andM;Arcaid Design Systems Ltd, based in Edinburgh, has launched an X WindowSystem version of its computer-aided design software for the constructionindustry: X-Board is a WYSIWYG-on-screen representation of a drawing boardfor Sun Microsystems workstations with X-terminals..pl 72andM;- o -andM;The era of open markets for computers resulting from the rusting away of theIron Curtain has proved no more than momentary, and, aghast at the equipmentthat has been shipped to Iraq over the years, the US State Department islooking at calling for sweeping new regulations that would block any exports,including advanced computers, that could be used in clandestine nuclear,missile, chemical or biological warfare research: as many as 50 countriescould end up on the list, most in the Third World, with Libya, Iraq, India,Pakistan, Israel and South Korea expected to be prominent - but according tothe Washington Post, the bar could affect as much as $250,000m of US exports,with violators facing fines of as much as $1m, 10 years in jail and a 10-yearexport ban.andM;- o -andM;Having found no buyer willing to pay its price for its defence units, ThornEMI Plc is restructuring Thorn EMI Electronics by other means and is to buythe net assets and business of MEL, the Crawley, Sussex-based UK defenceelectronics division of Philips Electronic andamp; Associated Industries Ltd, for#9.5m: MEL will be integrated with the Sensors Division of Thorn EMIElectronics, enabling resources to be rationalised; undoubtedly this meansjob losses but Colin Woodley of Thorn said it was too early to speculate; therestructuring of Thorn EMI Electronics, which has involved the closure of itsWoking, Surrey division, and the sale of four of the six divisions ofCalifornia-based subsidiary Systron Donner, has so far entailed a headcountreduction of 1,000 people.andM;- o -andM;A shell company with $74m in cash as at June 30 has spent $10m of that buyingshares representing an 8.2% stake in Zenith Electronics Corp, and it says itis considering acquiring control through a tender offer, merger proposal,proxy solicitation or by other means: the company, Nycor Inc of BaskingRidge, New Jersey, is a former subsidiary of an air conditioning company,Fedders Corp, and currently has no operating businesses; Nycor is controlledby the family of Fedders chairman Salvatore Giordano, also the chairman ofNycor.andM;- o -andM;Milpitas, California-based Quantum Corp reports that Apple Computer Inc isusing its 40Mb and 80Mb 1&quot; high 3.5&quot; ProDrive LPS hard disk drives in the newMacintosh Classic, LC and IIsi; no value given.andM;- o -andM;L M Ericsson Telefon AB has a $14m order for AXE exchnage and transmissionequipment for Hungary's rural telecommunications network: the order alsogives the new Ericsson-Muszertechnika joint venture company &quot;a flying start&quot;says the Swede; Muszertechnika is a 400-employee Hungarian electronicscompany that primarily focuses on the development and production ofcomputerised systems for the Hungarian market; Ericsson has already deliveredan AXE international exchange.andM;- o -andM;Irvine, California-based Corollary Inc reports that it has developed thetechnology to multithread serial input-output device drivers under SCO MPX,the multiprocessor extension to Santa Cruz Operation Inc Unix, also developedby Corollary and marketed by Santa Cruz: multithreading enables the sameprocess to be used by more than one user at the same time, and Corollary willadd support for multithreaded serial input-output to a future release of SCOMPX, at which point the company will begin shipping a multithreaded versionof the device driver for its 8 by 4 and 8 by 2 multiport boards, which itpromises means higher overall performance of SCO Unix-based multiprocessorsystems that use multiport boards to support multiple users; the technologywill also be passed on to other board vendors.andM;- o -andM;WordMarc International Corp has been formed in Palo Alto, California as thesuccessor company to Marc Software, distributor of WordMarc word processingsoftware and related software products: the new company will develop productsfor the multi-user office automation market and continue copying anddistributing the WordMarc program; Programmed Intelligence Corp of Norcross,Geotgia, developer and distributor of the Intelligent Querynon-application-specific query and report writer, is the major shareholder inthe new company.andM;- o -andM;Mediagenic Inc of Menlo Park, California, still better known as Activision,says it will sell its ZSoft Corp subsidiary to EGL Holdings, an Atlanta-basedventure capital firm, for $3.8m in cash, in order to focus on IBM-compatibleentertainment software and Nintendo video games: ZSoft, also based inAtlanta, publishes IBM graphics utilities for MS-DOS and Windows and wasbought in October 1988.andM;- o -andM;IBM has signed a royalty-free licence deal with ParcPlace Systems Inc ofMountain View, California for the use of the SmallTalk language and thedescription of the essential base classes of objects - IBM has used Smalltalkbefore by incorporating Digitalk Inc's SmallTalk/v PM into its range of OS/2tools, to encourage programs to be written for Presentation Manager (CI No1,443): in a separate agreement ParcPlace Systems is working with IBM to makeObjectworks/Smalltalk available for the RS/6000 in February 1991 - thisproduct enables programmers to develop applications on the RS/6000 and deploythem immediately on PS/2 under Windows 3.0; ironically, SmallTalk is one ofthe bulkier object-oriented languages and is not as popular as C++ amongdevelopers - but then C++ is ATandamp;T's baby and so one assumes IBM could notendorse it.andM;- o -andM;On the same day as, and clearly worried by, IBM's endorsement of SmallTalk,and the formation of the C++ Reseller Alliance (CI No 1,542), the fans of theother main object-oriented language, Bertrand Meyer's Eiffel, launched NICE -the Nonprofit International Consortium for Eiffel: Meyer has now turned overthe evolution of the language to NICE and parties interested in participatingshould contact Applied Logic Distribution of London SW15 for membershipinformation.andM;- o -andM;Qume Corp, Milpitas is suing Ultrastor Corp seeking to enforce Qume'sintellectual property and contractual rights and alleging willfulinfringement of copyrighted code in Qume's 15Mbps ESDI disk controller.andM;- o -andM;MGI GmbH, Frankfurt has developed a simulator for training staff to usecomputer commands particular to their company's system configuration: thesimulator, which Computerwoche claims is comparable to a flight simulator,offers task-driven training and the function, syntax and description commandscan also be used as an online refence book; the simulation package can servemultiple users from one installation on the host machine.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
