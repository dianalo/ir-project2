A budgeted 1989current-account deficit of 11.1 billion kroner ($1.64 billion) maybecome a surplus,'' Finance Minister Gunnar Berge said in a statetelevision interview.   Tough government austerity measures, including wage controls,helped cut annual inflation to 4.3 percent in March from a 10.4percent peak two years earlier.   Belt-tightening, improved oil prices and strong markets for itsmetals, timber and shipping industries turned a $44.5 millionfirst-quarter 1988 trade deficit into a $1.4 billion surplus thisyear, said officials.   Experts expect Norway's gross national product to expand 1.9percent in 1989, an improvement on 1988's 0.7 percent rate but welloff 1986's 4.2 percent figure.   While Norway's economy is performing better in some areas thanits main trading partners', Bjoern Skogstad Aamo, the financeminister's deputy, warned that ``economic uncertainty is stillgenuine.''   The country's unemployment rate reached a postwar record _ itdoubled in a year to about 4 percent last year _ as businessbankruptcies soared from 1,426 in 1986 to 3,891 last year andconsumer spending declined.   The minority Labor Government, facing a Sept. 11 nationalelection under its traditional slogan, ``Employment For All,'' hasforwarded the most comprehensive jobs package in Norway's history.   It also cut interest rates, which were hiked in 1987 to morethan 20 percent for some consumer loans, to stimulate the nation'sailing construction, auto sales and other business.   This coastal nation of 4.2 million people was unprepared foroil's boom and bust when the 1969 discovery of rich offshorereserves brought prosperity, nearly full employment and eventuallyan overheated economy.   In 1986, the 840,000 barrels of oil a day plus natural gasNorway pumped represented 43 percent of its exports. Today it isEurope's second-largest oil exporter, after Britain, at 1.4 millionbarrels a day, but low crude prices cut oil's share of 1988 exportsto 35 percent.   Oil wealth, relaxed credit and heavy private borrowing fanned anunprecented consumer spending spree, which was abruptlyextinguished by low oil prices and high interest rates.   ``Norway learned the painful lesson that easy oil money inflateswages and costs ... at the expense of its traditional industries'ability to compete internationally,'' said Roy Halvorsen, of theOslo Stock Exchange.   ``The idealists in business are being replaced by leaders whosegoal is to turn a profit,'' he said.   The business magazine Nordic Economic Outlook said Norway'snon-oil exports have increased 6 percent a year since 1986, partlybecause ``the decline in domestic demand has forced manufacturersto focus on production for export.''   Berge said his 1990-1993 economic plan, due for parliamentaryreview in May, will shield Norway from unstable oil prices anddwindling petroleum reserves with an oil royalties trust, gearedtoward stimulating traditional industry and research and towardeliminating foreign debt by the year 2000.   Any oil revenues exceeding 1989 budget estimates of $8.5billion, based on $14 per barrel of oil, should go towards reducingNorway's foreign debt, which stood at $17.5 billion in 1988, hesaid.   The Oslo Stock Market recovered from the October 1987 globalcrash to set all-time records in April 1989, 10 percent abovepre-crash levels.</TEXT></DOC>
