But her life was saved because one of her physicians had heardabout an experimental drug for Henderson's infection during alunchtime conversation earlier that day. Federal officials gavequick approval for her to be given the drug, and a month later,she's at home.   ``I'm still kind of in a stupor, walking around my apartment,''Henderson, 55, of Santa Monica, said Thursday in a telephoneinterview. ``I'm saying `Hey, I made it.'''   Her doctors said the bacteria infection, called Gram-negativesepsis, developed after Henderson's immune system was weakened bychemotherapy for cancer of the lymph system.   ``She was on the brink of death. There is no doubt about that,''said Dr. George Fareed. It was Fareed who told Dr. Peter Boasberg,one of Henderson's physicians, about the sepsis treatment beingtested by Xoma Corp., where Fareed is director of new productdevelopment.   When Henderson's body began failing the afternoon of April 23,Boasberg called Fareed at his Santa Monica office to ask if hecould get hold of the drug they had discussed at lunchtime,Xomen-E5.   A hurried round of phone calls followed to Xoma's Berkeleyheadquarters and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, seeking awaiver to administer the experimental drug under a ``compassionateuse'' exemption, Fareed said.   Final approvals were given within four hours, and arrangementsmade for a Xoma employee to fly the drug to Santa Monica.   ``It was incredible,'' said another of Henderson's doctors, Dr.Leonard Fromer. ``She was on death's doorstep, and she got this(drug) at midnight and four hours later every objective sign of hercondition was improved.   ``I fully believe she would have died without the drug.''   The infection-causing bacteria _ called Gram-negative becausecells don't hold a dye in a laboratory staining procedure _conventionally have been attacked with antibiotics.   But that treatment, while killing the bacteria, fails to attacktoxins the organism produces. Of 200,000 Gram-negative sepsis caseseach year in the United States, an estimated 80,000 to 100,000result in death, Fareed said.   The new drug from Xoma, and one developed by another company,Centocor Inc. of Malvern, Pa., bind to the toxins and block theireffect.   Xoma and Centocor, which manufactures Centoxin, are seeking FDAapproval for the drugs.   Dr. Harvey Rubin, an infectious disease specialist at theUniversity of Pennsylvania who was involved in trials of Centoxin,called the new treatment exciting but said it requires furtherstudy.   ``The clinical trials were quite small. We have to wait for manymore people in wider trials before we can definitely say this isunequivocally efficacious,'' he said Friday.   Dr. Elizabeth Ziegler, a professor of medicine in the infectiousdiseases division of the University of California, San Diego,worked on the original testing of the antibody used in Centoxin andon clinical trials.   She also said the new approach is promising, but stressed thatit is an adjunct to traditional treatment and that not all sepsisdeaths can be prevented.   Henderson still has a medical battle to fight: She is undergoingtests that could lead to a bone marrow procedure aimed at wipingout her cancer.   But she said her recovery from Gram-negative sepsis has givenher hope.   ``I feel very confident with Drs. Boasberg and Fromer,'' shesaid. ``It's reaffirming that they are committed to their patients.It's a great feeling at this point in my life.''</TEXT></DOC>
