Carlucci saidWednesday he is satisfied with China's assertions that its growingarms trade will not contribute to instability in the Middle Eastand other volatile regions.   He told reporters two days of talks were the ``best discussionswe have ever had'' on the question, he was ``fully usatisfied''with the Chinese explanation and ``I hope we can put this issuebehind us.''   The United States ``will continue to work to expand thetechnology that is being made available to China,'' Carlucci said,adding without elaboration that new technology exchange programsare being discussed in aviation and other fields.   Boeing is negotiating the sale to China of about a dozen CH-47transport helicopters for use by a rapid deployment force. TheUnited States has supplied China with helicopters, technology forfighter jets, torpedoes and other ammunition.   Carlucci met on Wednesday with 84-year-old Deng Xiaoping,China's leader and head of the Central Military Commission.   He conferred Tuesday with Defense Minister Qin Jiwei, Premier LiPeng and Vice Premier Wu Xueqian.   Among matters discussed were U.S.-Soviet arms reduction talks,the Soviet military withdrawal from Afghanistan, the situations inCambodia and Korea, modernization of China's armed forces andChinese domestic policy.   The Chinese ``clearly attach great importance'' to their ownsatellite launching service, which could suffer serious losses ifWashington does not issue export licenses for U.S. communicationssatellites, Carlucci told reporters.   Defense Department officials said the issue was raised by allthe Chinese leaders Carlucci met on Tuesday, and urged the Reaganadministration to approve launching of U.S. satellites by China.   ``I indicated that from my perspective I did not see this as anational security issue,'' the defense secretary said. ``They havegiven us all the assurances we need on the safeguarding of thetechnology. It is not a technology transfer issue. It is a tradeissue.''   The Commerce Department and some U.S. congressmen have arguedthat launching American satellites with the Chinese Long Marchrocket would undermine efforts by U.S. companies to establishcommercial launching services.   Carlucci also was asked about a statement by Deng Xiaoping thathe hoped Vice President George Bush would win the presidentialelection.   Bush headed the U.S. liaison office in Beijing in 1974-75,before full diplomatic relations were established, and has met Dengand other Chinese leaders in frequent visits to China since then.   ``I gave him (Deng) about a billion absentee ballots,'' Carluccisaid jokingly.   Deng generally receives only visiting presidents and premiers.His meeting with Carlucci underscored the importance with whichChina views overall relations and military links with the UnitedStates.   Military ties have developed since diplomatic relations wereestablished in 1979. Exchanges of senior military officials arecommon, the United States sells a small amount of military hardwareto China and U.S. warships made a port call in 1986 at the YellowSea port of Qingdao.</TEXT></DOC>
