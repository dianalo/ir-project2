Garcia (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> ISS </CO><IN> TEX TNM </IN><TEXT>   An investor group led by Steven and Mitchell Rales of Washington, D.C., indicated willingness to sweeten its tender offer for Interco Inc. to $72 a share, or about $2.76 billion, if it can examine certain nonpublic Interco documents.    In an announcement yesterday, the group also said it is extending its $70-a-share bid for the St. Louis-based consumer goods maker.    Officials of Interco, the maker of such well-known brands as London Fog rain gear, Ethan Allen furniture and Converse athletic shoes, couldn't be reached for reaction to the Rales group's announcement. But there were indications that Interco is still working with its Wall Street advisers to thwart the Rales group's unsolicited bid.    Those advisers have been exploring such alternatives as finding a friendly merger partner and arranging a leveraged buy-out. Two weeks ago, Interco said it had begun talks with potential friendly suitors, some of them commercial banks, but didn't identify any of them.    The current offer of $2.47 billion from the Rales group is now scheduled to expire Sept. 22, unless extended again. In an effort to bring Interco's board to the negotiating table sooner, the group also said it is willing to pay as much as $72 a share if it can review the same confidential financial information Interco is making available to other parties. The offer to pay a higher price is on the table until Thursday at 5 p.m. EDT, the Rales group said.    As an additional inducement, the Rales group said it could boost its offer even further if a review of the nonpublic data on Interco showed the company's value is higher than the group has estimated.    In pressing ahead with the bid for Interco, the Rales group could force a test of the capital-raising capabilities of its investment banker, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. Indeed, the Interco battle is one of the most visible projects that Drexel Burnham is working on at the moment. But Drexel Burnham's prowess in the high-yield or &quot;junk&quot; bond market may have been damaged by formal charges of insider trading brought last week by the Securities and Exchange Commission.    Michael Goldberg, a Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher andamp; Flom attorney representing the Rales brothers, said the group is &quot;still confident&quot; that Drexel Burnham can raise the $1.37 billion it had previously promised.    The Rales group also has a commitment from Chase Manhattan Bank to provide as much as $500 million for the Interco takeover. Chase also has said it is &quot;highly confident&quot; that it can form a syndicate of banks to raise a total of $2.25 billion.    Interco shares, which had been trading at more than $72 a share since the Rales group launched its tender offer last month, fell below $70 on the news last week that Drexel Burnham had been charged by the SEC. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday, Interco shares closed at $70.125, up 12.5 cents, on heavy volume of 1.9 million shares.    The Rales group, which already holds an 8.7% stake in Interco, said it is willing to sign a confidentiality agreement to review the company's nonpublic documents. But the group refused to sign standstill agreements, which Interco is requiring of other would-be suitors who are getting a peek at the same information. </TEXT></DOC>
