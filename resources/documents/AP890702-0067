Troops guarded polls in BajaCalifornia and Michoacan, where close races were expected.   Also voting were residents of the states of Campeche, Chihuahuaand Zacatecas.   Polls officially closed at 6 p.m., but some remained open longerto allow people waiting in line at closing time to vote. UnderMexican law, the government has a week to announce election results.   Opposition party members, congressmen and the independent Frontfor the Defense of the Vote monitored the 1,166 polling places inBaja, an opposition stronghold, to see if President Carlos Salinasde Gortari's promise of clean elections was upheld.   ``If he doesn't accomplish this, everybody will see it and peoplewill stop believing in him,'' said Jorge Barnetche of the3,000-member independent citizens' group.   The opposition National Action Party alleged that officials inthe northwestern border state used forged documents to register somepeople more than once. It also said officials burned 24,000 voteridentification cards of purported dead people last week but thatmany of the cards belonged to opposition supporters.   Some of Baja's 882,461 registered voters lined up early to choosea new governor, mayor and state legislature. The other states werechoosing state legislatures. Chihuahua also was electing all 67mayors.   In a hillside neighborhood of tar paper and plywood shacks in theborder city of Tijuana, Baja voters said they began gatheringoutside polling stations at 5:30 a.m.   ``I vote to improve the government. They make promises but don'tlive up to them,'' said Antonia Cerillo, one of dozens waiting inline at one polling place.   The governing party faced tough opposition in Baja Californiafrom conservatives and in Michoacan, the home of leftist oppositionleader Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, who ran for president last year.   Some polls opened late in Michoacan, which was electing a new24-member legislature. The governing party held 18 of these seatsfrom the last election in 1986.   In elections last year, Michoacanos gave 64 percent of their votein the presidential election to Cardenas, heading a leftistcoalition. He recently formed the Democratic Revolutionary Party.   In Chihuahua, congressman Pedro Cesar Acosta of the conservativeNational Action Party, or PAN, said no major incidents had beenreported by late afternoon but there were problems with theindelible ink used to mark voters' fingers, a common complaint inMexican elections.   ``In some cases it works, to the point of burning the finger,''he said by telephone. ``In others it doesn't make a stain untilhours later. In my case, it worked from the beginning and hasn'tcome off and it's been four hours since I voted.''   PAN made substantial gains in Chihuahua in 1983 but lost groundto the PRI three years later in elections marked by allegations offraud. Abel Vicencio Tovar, another PAN congressman, alleged the inkwas part of PRI's ``operation carrousel'' to have voters go from onepolling place to another casting ballots.   In Baja, the latest polls showed a dead heat between conservativeErnesto Ruffo and governing party candidate Margarita Ortega.   Ruffo, 37, a popular former mayor of the Pacific coast city ofEnsenada, said Saturday night that the situation was calm despitehis party's complaints of voter irregularities.   ``We're used to these irregularities. But we will watch officialsand we are confident that the election will be successful,'' saidRuffo. If he wins, he will become the first governor from anopposition party since the governing party was founded and rose topower 60 years ago.   Ms. Ortega, 38, is considered honest even by her opponents and,if she wins, she would become Mexico's third woman governor.   The opposition was hopeful of winning in this prosperous borderstate because its citizens gave Salinas only one third of theirvotes in last year's election.   A poll published Friday in the Mexico City daily La Jornadashowed Ruffo at 33.7 percent and Ms. Ortega with 32.7 percent ofpotential voters.   Opposition parties claimed widespread voter fraud in thepresidential election, but the governing party denied that. Salinashas since campaigned against fraud and corruption.</TEXT></DOC>
