The company said the investigation concerns a product sale valued at about $600,000 by its Ocean Applied Research unit. Five other companies also are targets of the investigation, which pertains to the Foreign Military Sales Program, CompuDyne said. The other companies weren't identified.    CompuDyne, a provider of technological services to government agencies and other customers, said fines could be sought and Ocean Applied Research might be ineligible for government contract awards &quot;for some period of time&quot; if charges are brought and the unit is found guilty.    But the company said it doesn't believe its subsidiary violated any law relating to the arms program and would &quot;vigorously defend&quot; against prosecution of any such charges.    CompuDyne also said it is cooperating with the Justice Department probe and is conducting its own investigation. </TEXT></DOC>
