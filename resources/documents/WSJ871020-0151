In fact, recent evidence indicates that the threshold to achieve and maintain fitness and health for the average adult is far lower than originally thought. Activities such as gardening and walking, if engaged in on a regular basis, can provide health benefits similar to those conferred by traditional exercise programs carried out in health clubs and with less likelihood of injury.    Walt Gardner   Management Fitness Corp.   Los Angeles   ---   Moderation is the rule for the majority of those who have been fortunate enough to experience the health and wellness benefits of regular exercise. Unfortunately, most Americans take better care of their cars than their bodies. With yearly medical costs approaching $400 billion, we must make good health and exercise habits a national priority. Otherwise, Medicare and catastrophic ills will literally bankrupt us. The next generation of elderly Americans deserves this high quality of life.    Albert E. Germain   Pittsburgh   ---   Previously as chief resident at Stanford University and now in a busy sports-medicine practice, I have seen a large spectrum of exercise-related syndromes, from the professional athlete to the &quot;weekend warrior.&quot; No doubt there are those with pathological coping mechanisms resulting in exercise abuse. However, there often is a fine line between the abusers and those individuals striving to enhance the quality of their lives through exercise. My concern arises when the two are confused and a healthy behavior is discouraged.    The majority of overuse injuries, such as shin splints mentioned in the article, are the result of errors in training techniques -- usually too much, too soon. The human musculoskeletal system can withstand tremendous stress, but only if it is properly conditioned. Amateur athletes, including exercise enthusiasts, lack the comprehensive medical support that we give to our professional athletes. With proper medical guidance, these supposed &quot;exercise addicts&quot; would stand a much better chance at decreasing the incidence of their injuries. Let's be very cautious at labeling someone harmfully addicted to exercise simply because they sustain injuries and are eager to maintain their fitness levels and achieve that natural &quot;high.&quot;    A far greater problem in this country is the vast numbers of unfit, out-of-shape and often unhealthy Americans. We must not discourage this group from reaping the many benefits of a well-supervised exercise program.    Todd J. Molnar, M.D.   Sports Medicine Center   San Diego   ---   As a runner, your article about the &quot;sins of running in pursuit of impossible dreams&quot; prompts me to recite the wisdom of Mark Twain who once said, &quot;Few things are harder for people to put up with than the annoyance of a good example.&quot;    John C.
