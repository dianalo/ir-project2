(Or, WhyFinancial Planners May Be Useless)---By Larry ReibsteinStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 01/15/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> TAXES </IN><TEXT>   Would an apprentice auto mechanic study from a Model-T repair manual? Of course not. Would a pre-med student consider using whiskey as an anesthetic? No. Would an aspiring financial planner bone up on last year's obsolete tax law?    Well, yes.    This Saturday some 2,600 people hoping to become certified financial planners will file into classrooms around the country to be tested on their knowledge of tax law and planning. If they pass this test and two others, they can rightly call themselves a Certified Financial Planner, or CFP. It's a cachet worth extra business.    But there's a problem with Saturday's test: It's based on the old tax law. The would-be planners have taken courses and spent hours studying a law that doesn't exist anymore, a law of vastly different tax rates and deductions.    One New Jersey stockbroker who is taking the test agreed to talk about it -- but only after repeated assurances that his name wouldn't be used. Why? &quot;It's embarrassing,&quot; he says. &quot;Do you think I want a client to know that I took a three-day course to study an old law? I have spent a lot of time on a test that will have lots of stuff in it that I will never use again. People are going to read this story and say, 'Look at these jerks.'&quot;    Officials at the College for Financial Planning, the Denver-based group that oversees the certification program, strongly deny that the test-takers are jerks. The fact that the law was enacted relatively late last year left little time to interpret it and write new course materials and tests, says Kenneth Huggins, the program director.    &quot;A lot of the material may not be relevant but you could find the tax laws changed next year again,&quot; he says. &quot;Regardless of the changes, it's important that financial planners have a firm grasp of tax-planning fundamentals.&quot;    Susanne Albert, for one, decided to take the test Saturday and has no regrets. A planner for IDS Financial Services in Morristown, N.J., Ms. Albert figures that understanding a client's investment strategy under the old law will help her do a better job shaping a new financial plan.    And, she confides, she is taking the test because &quot;the CFP is a union card,&quot; an almost indispensable aid in landing clients. Already well-versed in tax planning, Ms. Albert adds, &quot;I'm not there to learn tax law. I'm there to get my union card as fast as possible.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
