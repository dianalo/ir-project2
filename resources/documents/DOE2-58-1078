<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-58-1078 </DOCNO><TEXT>A medium level technology for producing robust high performance steamengines is described, which results in engines in the range of a fewkW to megawatts, being based on converting certain diesel engine blocksto steam operation. Such engines have operated in systems with outputsof 25 kW/sub e/ and 50 kW/sub e/, efficiently and reliably (in the formercase since 1982) with less required attention than for diesel engines.The engines may be employed in various applications, including the useof steam generated from solar energy, biomass (including crop residues),waste heat, and the burning of municipal wastes to produce mechanicaland electrical outputs (and process heat) for electricity generationin remote areas, rural village power supplies, mechanical drives forwater pumping, co-generation and many others.</TEXT></DOC>
