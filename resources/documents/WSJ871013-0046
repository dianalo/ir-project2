So is this it? Is the five-year bull market over?    One indicator with a following on Wall Street is insider buying and selling. The theory is that no one knows more about their companies than the officers, directors and large stockholders who must report their trades to the Securities and Exchange Commission.    Insiders don't act as though the bull market is dead yet, according to several of those who inspect such data. That could be encouraging to other investors, because insiders have been bullish for most of the past year's rally.    Edwin Buck, editor of Vickers Weekly Insider Report in Brookside, N.J., said the last two batches of weekly data improved unexpectedly after 10 weeks of weakening. &quot;I'm very encouraged,&quot; he said yesterday. &quot;I was scared out of my wits like everybody else&quot; by the earlier data and market's recent slump, he said.    Mr. Buck uses an eight-week moving average of the ratio of sales to purchases. Insiders usually sell more than they buy because many get their stock through options or grants from the company instead of market purchases. Since 1971, Vickers says, a ratio under 2.5 generally leads to higher markets. A figure above 2.5 tends to presage lower markets.    Vickers raised a &quot;caution&quot; flag Sept. 23 after the eight-week average rose to 2.06 from a recent low of 1.3 in mid-July, saying it seemed certain the ratio would pierce the dreaded 2.5 mark. But the next two weekly ratios of 1.18 and 1.91 held the increase to the still-favorable current level of 2.26.    For now, Mr. Buck still has the caution flag up. &quot;I would say that another couple of weeks, maybe even one more week of good sell-buy ratios and I would become bullish again,&quot; he says. But for now, &quot;I wouldn't be in a hurry to do anything, sell or buy, right here.&quot;    Among individual stocks, Vickers sees buying in closed-end mutual funds trading at a discount to their asset value, such as the Gabelli Equity Trust, the Zweig Fund, and the Liberty All-Star Equity fund. Insiders have also been buying Fisher Scientific, a Henley spinoff, and Horn andamp; Hardart. Mr. Buck says insiders have been selling Motorola, Du Pont and Digital Equipment.    Norman G. Fosback, editor of Insiders, a newsletter based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., believes insiders &quot;are really very bullish.&quot; He says the indicator &quot;is one of the most strongly bullish factors on the scene.&quot;    Mr. Fosback only counts trades executed within the past 30 days. He says the latest weekly report shows 59% of insider executives were buyers in open-market trades and only 41% were sellers. The normal ratio is 35% to 65% buyers to sellers, Mr. Fosback says.    Mr. Fosback agrees that insider sentiment weakened a bit a few months ago to &quot;moderately bullish, but today it has snapped back to as high as at any time in the last year.&quot;    Mr. Fosback says insiders have been buying three laggard financial stocks, Bankamerica, Financial Corp. of America and Reliance Group. And he sees heavy selling in T. Rowe Price Associates, Management Science America, Federal Express and Wal-Mart Stores.    William Mehlman, editor of New York-based Insiders Chronicle, agrees that the current outlook is neutral to slightly positive. &quot;I don't get any reading of impending disaster,&quot; he said.    But Bob Gabele, president of Invest/Net Group in Miami, noted that the overall volume of insider activity is off, reducing the ratios' significance. &quot;We don't see a wholesale unloading of stocks. But we haven't seen a lot of buying at higher prices either,&quot; he said.    Richard Horowitz, president of Dallas-based Insiders Edge, which sells research to institutional investors, says some important oil-patch insiders have been selling stocks of companies with their names on them, such as Murphy Oil Chairman Charles Murphy Jr. and Helmerich andamp; Payne President Walter Helmerich III.    &quot;We would regard that as being a warning about oil stocks. We would be concerned about that group,&quot; said Mr. Horowitz.    Insiders' buying and selling is only one of many technical indicators that aim to divine the future by close analysis of the past. They include stock charts, breadth ratios, and institutional buying.    Skeptics wonder whether any of these techniques has much validity in a market generally considered efficient -- meaning that its pricing takes into account all known facts and legitimate inferences.    Few skeptics would be persuaded by the recent performance of the only mutual fund that attempts to trade based on insiders' reports. The tiny $3.7 million Insider Reports Fund, based in New York, racked up a total return of only 6.55% in the year ended Sept. 30. That's a long way behind the 33.63% return for the average equity mutual fund, according to Lipper Analytical Services.
