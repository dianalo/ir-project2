The agreement with Spain, which was signed on September 30, 1986,is similar to U.S. social security agreements already in force with eightother countries_Belgium, Canada, the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy,Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Agreements of thistype are authorized by section 233 of the Social Security Act. Like the other agreements, the U.S.-Spanish agreement eliminates dual socialsecurity coverage_the situation that exists when a person from one countryworks in the other country and is covered under the social security systemsof both countries for the same work. When dual coverage occurs, the workerand his or her employer may be required to pay social security contributionsto the two countries simultaneously. Under the U.S.-Spanish agreement,an employee who is sent by an employer in the U.S. to work in Spain for5 years or less remains covered only by the U.S. system. The agreementincludes additional rules that eliminates dual U.S. and Spanish coveragein other work situations. The agreement also helps eliminate situations where workers suffer a lossof benefit rights merely because they have divided their careers betweenthe two countries. Under the agreement, workers may qualify for partialU.S. or Spanish benefits based on combined (totalized) work credits fromboth countries.
