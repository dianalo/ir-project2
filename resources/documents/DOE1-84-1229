We use it to study the SU(3) puregauge theory at both zero and finite temperature. We also compute strongand weak coupling expansions for the density of states and find excellentagreement with our data. Using a specially developed algorithm for solvinghigh-order polynomials, we find the zeroes of the partition function.For lattices with L/sub t/ = 2, we test the finite-size scaling predictionfor the rounding of the transition by following the motion of these zeroesfor L/sub s/ = 6, 8, 10, and 12. We find that the correlation lengthexponent is 1/{nu} = 3.02+-0.05, in excellent agreement with the valued=3 expected for a first-order deconfinement transition.</TEXT></DOC>
