The FMP was developed by the North Pacific FisheryManagement Council (Council) and is implemented by rules appearing at 50CFR 611.93 and Part 675.The total allowable catch (TAC) for various groundfish species is apportionedinitially among domestic annual harvest (DAH), reserves, and the totalallowable level of foreign fishing (TALFF). The reserve and DAH amounts,in turn, are to be apportioned to DAH and/or TALFF during the fishing year,under 50 CFR 611.93(c) and 675.20(b). As soon as practicable after April1, June 1, August 1, and on such other dates as are necessary, the Secretaryof Commerce apportions to JVP the part of domestic annual processing (DAP)that he determines will not be harvested by U.S. vessels and deliveredto U.S. processors during the remainder of the year, unless such apportionmentswould adversely affect the conservation of groundfish resources or prohibitedspecies.The initial specifications of DAP for 1988 were based on the projectedneeds of the U.S. processing industry as assessed by a mail survey sentby the Director, Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Director) to fishermen andprocessors in October 1987. After 15 percent of the Bering Sea and AleutianIslands (BSAI) TAC was placed in the non-specific reserve, as requiredat 50 CFR 675.20(a)(3), the initial specifications for DAP were determined,and the remaining amounts were provided to JVP (53 FR 894, January 14,1988). No initial specification was provided for TALFF because DAH requirementsexceeded TAC.On January 14 (53 FR 894) JVP was supplemented by 804 mt of the non-specificreserve to provide necessary bycatch of Greenland turbot, Pacific oceanperch, rockfish, sablefish, and squid. On April 14 (53 FR 12772, April19, 1988), JVP was supplemented by 24,000 mt of the non-specific reserveto provide additional amounts of yellowfin sole, ``other flatfish,'' andPacific cod in order to allow joint venture operations to continue withoutinterruption. At its April meeting, the Council recommended that the RegionalDirector supplement the JVP for pollock in the Bering Sea by 100,000 mt.On May 5 (53 FR 16552, May 10, 1988), JVP was supplemented by 135,030 mtof the non-specific reserve to provide the recommended amount of pollockand necessary bycatch amounts of Greenland turbot, ``other flatfish,''Pacific cod, and ``other species.''In early May, the Regional Director completed a second survey to determineDAP needs. On May 20 (53 FR 19303, May 25, 1988) JVP was supplemented by96,000 mt of the non-specific reserve to provide additional amounts ofpollock, arrowtooth flounder, and ``other flatfish,'' and DAP was supplementedby 10,000 mt of the non-specific reserve to provide an additional amountof ``other flatfish.'' On June 17 (63 FR 23402, June 22, 1988) JVP wassupplemented by 6,770 mt of the non-specific reserve to provide additionalamounts of Aleutian Islands subarea pollock, and Greenland turbot. On July11 (53 FR 26599, July 14, 1988) JVP was supplemented by 1,200 mt from DAPto provide bycatch amounts of Aleutian Islands subarea Pacific ocean perchand ``other rockfish.''<ITAG tagnum="84">Reapportionment</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table 1._Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands Reapportionments of TAC</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[All values are in metric tons]</ITAG><H1> </H1><H1> </H1><H1>Current</H1><H1>This action</H1><H1>Revised</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Pacific cod<D>DAP</D><D>87,416</D><D>^5,000</D><D>82,416</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">(TAC=200,000; ABC=385,000)<D>JVP</D><D>100,584</D><D>+5,000</D><D>105,584</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Total (TAC=2,000,000)<D>DAP</D><D>801,320</D><D>^5,000</D><D>796,320</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>JVP</D><D>1,171,284</D><D>+5,000</D><D>1,176,284</D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>Reserves</D><D>27,396</D><D/><D>27,396</D></ITAG>The following actions are taken by this notice to reapportion groundfishfrom DAP to JVP fisheries.<ITAG tagnum="84">To the BSIA JVP</ITAG>In the Bering Sea subarea, about 20 U.S. catcher boats delivering fishto a dozen foreign processors are conducting directed fisheries on ``otherflatfish'' and have intermittently experienced high bycatch amounts toPacific cod. At current catch rates, the current JVP of Pacific cod isin danger of being reached in the near future. Should its JVP be reached,Pacific cod would be required to be discarded, resulting in wastage andreduced income to U.S. fishermen who would otherwise be paid for retainedand processed amounts.The current DAP catch (34,542 mt) of Pacific cod is only 40 percent ofthe 87,416 mt DAP quota. The results of the NMPS May DAP survey indicatedan expected catch of 38,015 mt by the end of the second quarter. For thisreason, the Regional Director has determined that the current DAP amountfor Pacific cod is excess to DAP needs in 1988. Therefore, 5,000 mt ofthe DAP amount for Pacific cod is transferred to JVP to provide bycatchin JVP fisheries.This apportionment does not result in overfishing of Pacific cod stocks,as the resulting species TAC does not exceed its ABC.<ITAG tagnum="84">Classification</ITAG>This action is taken under the authority of 50 CFR 675.20(b) and complieswith Executive Order 12291.The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries finds for good cause that itis impractical and contrary to the public interest to provide prior noticeand comment. Immediate effectiveness of this notice is necessary to benefitdomestic fishermen who otherwise would have to discard substantial amountsof Pacific cod if non-retention was required as a result of achieving apreviously specified JVP amount. However, interested persons are invitedto submit comments in writing to the address above for 15 days after theeffective date of this notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 675</ITAG>Fish, Fisheries, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: July 22, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Ann D.
