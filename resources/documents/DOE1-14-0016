The tissue signature is basedon five measured parameters: four describe the tissue structure and scatteringproperties, the fifth is the US attenuation. The patient groups studiedincluded 31 healthy subjects, 97 patients with chronic active hepatitis,62 with Gaucher disease, and 10 with lymphomas. Receiver operating characteristiccurve analysis was used to compare the diagnostic performance of thequantitative method with the clinical reading of trained observers. Thequantitative method showed greater diagnostic capability for detectingand classifying diffuse and some focal disease.</TEXT></DOC>
