RobertsStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 04/21/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> USW BLS BELEARNINGS (ERN)TELECOMMUNICATIONS, BROADCASTING, TELEPHONE, TELEGRAPH (TEL) </IN><TEXT>   Three regional Bell operating companies reported higher first-quarter earnings.    U S West Inc.'s profit in the quarter rose 14%; Bell Atlantic Corp.'s increased 6.1%; and BellSouth Corp.'s climbed 7.7%. The three were the last of the seven regional Bell holding companies to report results, which overall were among the least robust posted since the 1984 breakup of the Bell system.    The earnings growth of Englewood, Colo.-based U S West masked weak performance by its basic telephone operations, which serve a sparsely populated and economically anemic region of 14 Western states, analysts said. The results of Bell Atlantic and especially BellSouth showed solid growth of their basic telephone operations, underscoring the strong regional economies the two companies serve.    All three companies turned in strong performances in their unregulated -- or non-telephone company -- units, according to analysts' estimates and the companies' own general statements. &quot;The unregulated (units) are doing very nicely,&quot; said James McCabe, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp.    U S West posted net income of $204.2 million, or $1.08 a share, compared with year-earlier profit of $179.9 million, or 94 cents a share, adjusted to reflect a 2-for-1 stock split. Revenue was about flat at $2.04 billion, compared with $2.03 billion a year earlier.    Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic reported net income of $307.5 million, or $1.54 a share, compared with $289.9 million, or $1.45 a share, a year earlier. Revenue climbed 4.5% to $2.46 billion from $2.36 billion.    Atlanta-based BellSouth posted profit of $452.4 million, or 94 cents a share, compared with year-earlier net of $420 million, or 91 cents a share, adjusted to reflect a 3-for-2 stock split. Revenue rose 5% to $2.95 billion from $2.81 billion.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, U S West closed at $50.75, up 12.5 cents; BellSouth closed at $38.625, up 87.5 cents; and Bell Atlantic rose $1.125 to close at $65.125.    &quot;U S West is a lot worse than I expected,&quot; said Mr. McCabe. The growth of telephones and use of telephone service were low, analysts noted. Moreover, revenue derived from making interstate long-distance connections declined sharply. The drop, analysts said, reflected a more negative impact than expected from a cut in access charges that went into effect this year. A U S West spokeswoman said the results reflected &quot;a solid quarter.&quot;    The earnings were reduced by $23.6 million in one-time expenses for a plan that encouraged employees to retire. Some 1,400 managers of U S West's three telephone company units took advantage of the incentive plan, the company said. In the year-earlier period, the company's profit was reduced by $43.3 million for a similar plan.    The latest results also included a $6.6 million charge related to a refund to customers ordered by regulators in Oregon. Excluding the one-time expenses and charges in the most recent and year-earlier quarters, the latest results would have shown a 5% increase, U S West said.    Although the spokeswoman provided no details, she said U S West was &quot;pleased by the (unregulated) operations.&quot; As previously reported, U S West said those operations would be profitable for the first time in 1987, and that it is relying on them for any profit gains this year.    Patrick Jurczak, an analyst with E.F. Hutton andamp; Co., estimated that U S West posted losses of $5 million to $10 million in those operations, &quot;a significant improvement&quot; from the $15 million to $20 million in estimated quarterly losses a year earlier.    At Bell Atlantic, revenue at unregulated units rose an estimated 25%, said Mr. McCabe, who added, &quot;they are doing very well.&quot; Thomas E. Bolger, chairman and chief executive officer, cited &quot;the impact of regional business growth on our Network Services companies and the improved earnings of our Enterprise group of unregulated companies.&quot;    Mr. Jurszak said Bell Atlantic's leasing units in particular appear to have posted &quot;nice profits.&quot; The company doesn't report the results of its unregulated businesses.    In Atlanta, John L. Clendenin, BellSouth's chairman and chief executive, said the results &quot;reflect strong growth in both our telephone operating companies and our non-regulated subsidiaries.&quot; While also providing no details of the unregulated businesses, he said BellSouth telephone company units added a record 177,000 new access lines. </TEXT></DOC>
