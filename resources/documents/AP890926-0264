Tuesdayrevealed ambitious plans for Micro Channel Architecture, itspatent-covered design for the way information moves around insideits personal computers.   IBM also said that Micro Channel is theoretically capable oftransferring data at 160 million bytes per second, eight times asfast as its current speed limit. A byte represents one letter ornumber.   The announcements were intended in part to counter the momentumof a standard that is being pushed by the ``Gang of Nine'' _ rivalmakers of personal computers such as Compaq Computer Corp.   Advanced Logic Research Inc. recently said it will beginshipping the first computer built to that rival standard in October.   IBM said it intends to use Micro Channel not only with personalcomputers, but eventually with high-speed workstations and evenmainframe computers _ a landmark in the growing importance ofpersonal computers.   Although IBM's mainframe line uses a different system forinternal data transfer, the company said Micro Channel wouldeventually become the way that mainframes communicate with personalcomputers and workstations.   As a sign of the Micro Channel's importance, IBM said the designwould form the heart of a new line of workstations that willreplace the relatively unsuccessful RT PC late this year or earlyin 1990.   IBM has tried to make Micro Channel into an industry standard,but companies that have come out with compatible machines underlicense to IBM have had limited success. IBM is hoping thatTuesday's announcements will convince customers that Micro Channel,announced in 1987, is the wave of the future.   ``They're trying to show a sense of order in a potentiallychaotic environment,'' said Sam Albert, a former IBM executive whois now a consultant in Scarsdale, N.Y.   IBM's rivals say their personal computer standard is betterbecause there are more add-on devices that will work with it. ButIBM said there are more than 1,000 add-on devices made by othercompanies to enhance the IBM Personal System-2, and more in theworks.   In addition, Intel Corp. and Chips and Technologies Inc. bothsaid Tuesday they were working with IBM on developing sets of chipsthat other companies could use to make compatible add-on devicesfor the Micro Channel.   IBM reaffirmed that it would come out with a personal computerbuilt on Intel Corp.'s latest microprocessor, the high-speed i486,by the end of the year. It cut prices and introduced new variationson several existing models in its Personal System-2 line.</TEXT></DOC>
