(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   If life begins at conception, doesthat mean a fetus cannot be jailed, or that someone can add ninemonths to his age to avoid being convicted of underage drinking?   Some Missouri attorneys are asking such questions after the U.S.Supreme Court upheld key portions of the state's 1986 abortion law.Legal experts say the lawyers are limited only by their imagination.   At issue is the law's preamble that says the life of each humanbegins at conception. It also says a fetus has the ``rights,privileges and immunities available to other persons, citizens andresidents of the state.''   In its July ruling, the Supreme Court did not strike down thepreamble, saying it was not unconstitutional because it has noenforceable restrictions on abortions. It also said state courtsmust decide how it applies to other Missouri laws.   Since the Supreme Court ruling, some lawyers have started usingthe life-begins-at-conception argument for other issues.   For instance:   _A U.S. District Court lawsuit contends a fetus is illegallyimprisoned because the mother is an inmate at a state prison. Itargues the fetus is not charged with a crime, convicted orsentenced. Attorney Michael Box, who filed the suit, said, ``Iflife begins at conception, then fetuses are supposed to be likeanyone else _ they're a person and they have constitutionalrights.''   _A 20-year-old Columbia man, charged with driving whileintoxicated and possession of alcohol by a minor, claimed thestate's law against underage drinking does not apply to him. Hesaid the life-begins-at-conception doctrine adds nine months to hislife, making him 21 _ Missouri's legal drinking age. A trial judgedisagreed, but the man's attorney, Daniel Dodson, plans to appeal.   _Anti-abortion protesters in St. Louis were acquitted oftrespassing charges from sit-in demonstrations at an abortionclinic. They argued they were trying to save lives by preventingabortions. The judge agreed, citing the preamble. Previously,another St. Louis judge used the same legal logic to find otherprotesters innocent of trespassing in a similar case.   While such arguments are inventive, legal authorities say, theystill must show legal merit to prevail.   ``I think you are going to have to make a close relationshipbetween the abortion statute and whatever other statute the courtor the attorneys are trying to apply,'' said Timothy Heinsz, deanof the University of Missouri-Columbia School of Law. ``Theargument is limited only by the creative mind of the attorney.''   Michael Boicourt, the assistant attorney general who helpeddefend the abortion law, said the preamble doesn't create anyrights or privileges for fetuses and merely states legislativepolicy. He said its main effect will be in property rights,personal injury and criminal law cases.   ``I don't think the preamble will ever be interpreted by thecourts to create a ridiculous result,'' Boicourt said.   Referring to attempts to apply the preamble language to theunderage driving and similar cases, he added: ``These cases aren'tserious. They are interesting to the public, but they aren'tlegally serious.''   State Rep. Sue Shear has asked Attorney General William Websterfor an opinion on whether the preamble affects various state lawsinvolving age requirements. Webster argued the case before theSupreme Court.   Ms. Shear said she sought the non-binding opinion because shethought lawyers would have a ``heyday'' with the preamble and itneeded to be resolved. Webster's office says it is researching theissue.   Louis DeFeo, executive director of the Missouri CatholicConference, said many of the issues could be raised under otherstate laws and court decisions.   ``The rights of unborn children didn't originate with this,''said DeFeo, a lawyer and one of the law's authors. ``Lawsuits canbe filed and claims recovered. Trusts and property can go to unbornchildren. There is nothing new with the law recognizing the rightsof the unborn.''   In an unrelated Tennessee case, a judge ruled recently that``life begins at conception'' and awarded temporary custody ofseven frozen embryos to a woman who is divorcing her husband. Thehusband plans to appeal, but legal authorities have said thedecision _ that embryos are persons _ might lead to inheritancedisputes or prompt in-vitro fertilization doctors to fear murdercharges if implanted embryos fail to come to term.   St. Louis attorney Frank Susman, who argued against the Missourilaw before the Supreme Court, said he warned that the ramificationswould be unknown and numerous.   The law, he said, ``demonstrates the total absurdity of what theLegislature did and of not having thought things through on a pieceof legislation.''   As to whether attorneys have any legal basis in some of thecases, Susman said it seems they do. ``The language suggests thatyou are a person from the moment of conception.''   Others say the publicity from the case has drawn lawyers'attention to the life-begin-at-conception argument.   ``It's almost like the Supreme Court put its stamp of appoval onit by not striking it down, and that makes it easier to utilize,''said St. Louis attorney Andrew Puzder, who came up with the idea ofthe preamble.   Even so, Puzder questioned some of the arguments, including theimprisoned fetus lawsuit.   ``It's a silly issue, whether an unborn child has a right to bewhere the mother isn't. That can never be. The legitimate issue isthe quality of pre-natal care and that is a legitimate issue withor without this statute,'' he said.   Puzder said the underage drinking case lacks merit because statelaw says a person's age is calculated from the time they are born.   ``This law was never intended to change the time by which youcompute a person's age by their date of birth,'' he said. ``Nobodyhas the right to have that date moved up or back. Nothing that sayslife begins at conception changes how the state computes age.''   The question of when life begins already has been addessed fortax purposes by state Revenue Director Duane Benton. After thecourt's ruling, some questioned whether a fetus could be claimed asa state tax deduction.   But Benton, a tax lawyer, decided the answer was no. He saidMissouri's tax law adopts provisions of the federal tax code, whichsay an unborn child is not a person for the purpose of a personalexemption.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Oct. 1</NOTE></DOC>
