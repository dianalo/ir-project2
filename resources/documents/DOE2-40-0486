Also included are data from the last quarter(October through December) of 1986. This report divides data collectionactivities into two parts. Part A covers general environmental monitoringwhich includes meteorology, aerial photography, air quality monitoring,water quality monitoring, and wildlife population surveillance. PartB focuses on the special studies being performed to evaluate the impactsof salt dispersal from the site on the surrounding ecosystem. The fourthyear of salt impact monitoring was completed in 1987. These studies involvethe monitoring of soil chemistry, soil microbiota, and vegetation inpermanent study plots. None of the findings indicate that the WIPP projectis adversely impacting environmental quality at the site. As in 1986,breeding bird censuses completed this year indicate changes in the localbird fauna associated with the WIPP site. The decline in small mammalpopulations noted in the 1986 census is still evident in the 1987 data;however, populations are showing signs of recovery. There is no indicationthat this decline is related to WIPP activities. Rather, the evidenceindicates that natural population fluctuations may be common in thisecosystem. 28 refs., 55 figs., 23 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
