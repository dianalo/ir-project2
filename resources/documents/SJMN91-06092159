Hard to say. Maybe not, in some counties. Probably, inothers. But the state wouldn't have to worry about it any more. Having passedthis proposal, Sacramento could wash its hands of mental health programs.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  SHELL GAMECOUNTIES COULD BE LEFT PICKING UP THE TABFOR MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Editorials  </MEMO><TEXT>     Today the state mandates services that counties must provide, and itsupposedly funds those services. But there is never enough money, and thedistribution is unfair: San Francisco and Marin counties each get more than$50 per needy person to spend on mental health care in a year, while SantaClara gets only $27 and San Diego gets $19.;    This year the new governorproposed giving counties more authority over mental health programs and alsogiving them revenue sources, such as vehicle registration fees. But theanalyst's office, working for the Legislature, says the funding is unlikely tokeep pace with the need.;    Some counties might be able to keep up services.But if others offered abysmally poor service to needy clients -- well, itwouldn't be Sacramento's problem.;    Giving counties more power over how tospend mental health funding makes sense; Los Angeles faces far differentproblems from Monterey. But the state should still set standards. People inTulare County should be guaranteed access to mental health care the same aspeople here in Santa Clara.;    And the state should provide the funding, eventhough there is one clear benefit to moving mental health funding to counties.In the state budget, mental health funds have been getting cut to satisfystate budget mandates like Proposition 98's guarantee of funding foreducation.;    Mental health programs would have a better chance competingagainst other county-funded programs.;    But county funding has a drawback.Although it is often unwilling to use it, the Legislature has the power toraise taxes. Counties are severely limited in how they can raise revenue.Authority over programs means nothing if they are bankrupt.;    It's good thatWilson wants to sort out this mess in county funding. But let's not trade oneshell game for another. Hold out for a plan that ensures both adequate fundingand reasonable standards -- accountability -- for mental health care.  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910401  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  392  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday April 1, 199100092159,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
