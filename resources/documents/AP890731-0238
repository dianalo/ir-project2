The rig count remained lower than the comparable period a yearago, when it totaled 894. Last week, the rig count jumped 10 tototal 830.   During the last nine weeks, the rig count has increased eighttimes.   ``About 25 of that increase of 40 was attributed to grounddrying out in the Ark-La-Tex region,'' said Ike Kerridge, BakerHughes vice president. The Ark-La-Tex region includes northernLouisiana and northeastern Texas.   ``Wet grounds makes it impossible to move rigs,'' Kerridge said.``If you're out in the middle of a corn field you just can't movethe rigs and you have to wait for the ground to dry.''   Tropical Storm Allison caused widespread flooding in Texas andLouisiana in June. And Monday, Tropical Storm Chantal was in theGulf of Mexico and could cause more heavy rains in the area,Kerridge said.   The company's rig count _ the widely watched industry index ofdrilling activity _ reflects the number of rigs actively exploringfor oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs activelyproducing oil.   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company thatmerged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kepttrack of the rig count since 1940.   In December 1981, at the height of the oil boom, the rig countreached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse inthe rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughesbegan compiling figures.</TEXT></DOC>
