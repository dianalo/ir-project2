Today it is. Ourobjective is to be the leader in the industry for workstations by1991,'' IBM spokeswoman Linda Dezan said.   Ms. Dezan's comments, based on the official IBM position, werean expansion of remarks by IBM executive Arthur G. Goldberg thatwere quoted in Wednesday's editions of the Wall Street Journal.   Workstations are expensive desktop computers that are typicallyused for work that requires intensive manipulation of numbers orsophisticated graphics, such as science, engineering, design andfinancial modeling.   IBM's RT workstation was widely faulted for being underpoweredand lacking in software when it was introduced in early 1986, andsales lagged badly. But Ms. Dezan said IBM has steadily addedsoftware while doubling the performance of the RT every 12 to 18months.   IBM had 3.9 percent of the worldwide market for workstationsused for science and engineering last year, trailing SunMicrosystems Inc.'s 29 percent share, Apollo Computer Inc.'s 21percent, Digital Equipment Corp.'s 20 percent and Hewlett-PackardCo.'s 12 percent, according to International Data Corp.   Those numbers understate the RT's popularity because they focusonly on machines used for science and engineering. About half theRTs sold are used for general corporate business.   Goldberg said a version of the RT that will be availablerelatively soon will be at least twice as fast as current modelsfor general-purpose computing and many times as fast forengineering and design work.   IBM has devoted a huge effort to improving the RT becauseworkstations are a booming segment of the computer industry, withindustrywide sales growing 30 percent a year.   June was the best month yet for RT sales because of improvementsalready made in the product, IBM says. The RT will get anotherboost from the $3.6 billion contract IBM recently won from theFederal Aviation Administration for an air-traffic-control system.That system will be largely based on the RT and will include 12,000to 15,000 RTs.   ``We have been experiencing much more success with the RT thanwe've generally been given credit for,'' Ms. Dezan said.   IBM says it is spending as much money on development of RThardware as on hardware for its huge personal computer business. Inaddition, it is increasing the number of marketing people for theRT ten-fold, to at least 300.</TEXT></DOC>
