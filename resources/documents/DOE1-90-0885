Analyzing the obtained data from the viewpointof phosphate glass heat resistance increase the additions of SiO/sub2/, Nb/sub 2/O/sub 5/ and fluorides should be singled out as perspectiveones. Preference should be given to silicon dioxide as a common, nonvolatilecomponent, which does not cause glass colouring.</TEXT></DOC>
