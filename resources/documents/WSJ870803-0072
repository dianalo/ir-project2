The 76-year-old president underwent his third excision for basal cell epithelioma, this time on the tip of his nose. The wound, closed with about 20 sutures, was about 12 millimeters in diameter and five millimeters deep, according to his physician, John Hutton.    Mr. Reagan, who received only a local anesthetic during the 45-minute procedure Friday, will be treated with pain medication such as Tylenol as required, Dr. Hutton said. &quot;The surgery went extremely well. President Reagan is in great spirits. He is in excellent health and was laughing and joking with staff upon his return to the White House,&quot; he said.    The president has a light schedule this week as he prepares a televised address for next week summarizing his reaction to the Iran-Contra hearings. On Aug. 13, he leaves for California for a 25-day vacation at his Santa Barbara ranch, with a trip to Los Angeles and possibly some political stops on the way out and back. </TEXT></DOC>
