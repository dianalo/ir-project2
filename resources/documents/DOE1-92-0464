The Khar'kov cokingplant tested an experimental installation for high-temperature conversionof ammonium thiocyanate. Design and operation of the installation withan output of 50 l/h ammonium thiocyanate solution are discussed. Thehigh-temperature reactor with corundum liner has an inner diameter of0.35 m, the reaction zone is 3.5 m high. Investigations showed that reactiontime in the reactor did not influence conversion efficiency. Decompositionof ammonium thiocyanate reached maximum at 900 C. When reaction temperaturedecreased to 600-670 C rate of thermal degradation of ammonium thiocyanatealso decreased. Chemical reactions during thermal degradation of ammoniumthiocyanate were analyzed. 8 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
