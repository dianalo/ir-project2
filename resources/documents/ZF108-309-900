But don't get me wrong: 95% of the usersout there are going to take their [Digital] VAXs, their MVs [Data GeneralCorp.'s line of proprietary systems] and their MVSs [IBM machines running theMVS operating system], and they are going to migrate them towardclient/server computing.andP;  We call it rehabilitating time-sharing systems.andM;Q: Do you expect traditional systems suppliers to radically redesign theirarchitectures?andM;A: Most of the established computer makers are first going to buy servers andnetwork computers from the likes of Auspex and resell them under their ownlabels.andP;  If you talk to Enzo [Torresi, chief executive officer of NetFrame],that's what he's doing these days--talking to companies like Prime.andP;  But overthe next two years, they will eventually build their own machines that arearchitected to run client/server applications.andM;Q: Do you then believe that IBM's next generation of mainframes will bedesigned with such an architecture?andM;A: No.andP;  Keep in mind that we're talking about revolutionaries here.andP;  Thisrevolution is not going to reach the bowels of Endicott IBM [Endicott, N.Y.,andO;is the home of one of IBM's biggest research labs] until three or four yearsfrom now .andP;  .  .  although client/server computing is one of the hottestbattles within IBM right now.andM;Q: Why should users start to compute with client/server systems versus onesthey already are using?andM;A: Technology aside, money is the answer.andP;  Every user we have talked to thatis engaged in client/server computing is doing so for money.andP;  It's cheaper.andO;And in some cases it's half as expensive as a minicomputer.andP;  It's one-thirdthe expense of mainframe computing.andM;Q: Where are the cost savings?andM;A: Number one, the savings are in the actual boxes themselves.andP;  Number two,writing an application under an object-oriented interface will take half aslong as doing it under COBOL or any of the old languages.andP;  .  .  .  Butyou've got to remember that all the client/server applications in use todayare being rolled by the users themselves.andP;  They're not buying theseapplications off the shelf.andM;Q: When will there be an abundance of off-the-shelf client/serverapplications software available to users?andM;A: You'll see it in 1990.andP;  Fourth Shift, for example, is building a materialsresource planning package that's going to be all client/server.andP;  There's ahealth-care software company, whose name escapes me for the moment, that'swriting client/server-based hospital management systems.andP;  The interestingdevelopment is that the early client/server software commercially availablecovers vertical applications, which has completely surprised us.andP;  Anothercommercially available application is from People Soft, which creates humanresources software.andM;Q: Does this trend also suggest that users are implementing client/servercomputing primarily for their own vertical applications rather than forhorizontal ones?andM;A: Right.andP;  Client/server computing is not going to be implemented by Joe ISstanding up one day and announcing: &quot;Today is client/server computing day;we're going to do it.&quot;andP;  It's not going to happen that way.andM;Instead, it's people we call departmental IS who are going to introduceclient/server computing to their organizations.andP;  They are therevolutionaries--people who are 30 years old, whether they are bankers,lawyers, accountants, who believe they can do this thing [automate theiroperations] better on their own.andP;  So they go out to buy their systemsseparately from central IS.andP;  .  .  .andM;I was with a manager from United Technologies a few weeks ago.andP;  He's a supplymanager.andP;  He knows nothing about computing.andP;  He went out and bought 35 Sunworkstations.andP;  He tied them together in a network to create a whole supplysystem.andP;  He was dismissed as a crazy revolutionary by central IS.andP;  But, ayear later, central IS is coming back to him for advice on how to implementhis type of system throughout the whole company.andM;The departmental IS activities are being cross-pollinated back to central IS.andO;.  .  .  The thing about central IS is that a lot of those guys will retirein five years.andP;  They will be gone.andP;  So the resistance to client/servercomputing that you might see from central IS is going to dissipate with time.andM;Q: Could the client/server computing phenomenon have occurred five years ago?andM;A: In the 1980s, a lot of authority and responsibility was dispersedthroughout the corporation.andP;  That dynamic, coupled with client/servercomputing, is creating this departmental IS phenomenon.andP;  .  .  .  It couldn'thave happened five years ago.andP;  Then, departments didn't have the authority tomanage their own IS systems.andP;  They didn't have the budgets to do so.andP;  If yougo back to the United Technology example, that department knows how to matchinformation technology to do its job.andM;Q: How can you say that profitability will increase from client/servercomputing?andM;A: .andP;  .  .  It's still very early for client/server computing.andP;  .  .  .  Trueclient/server computing will not be here for three to four years.andP;  Youcertainly see pockets of it now.andP;  But widespread use is still a ways to come.andO;You are going to see a level of frustration on the part of users as they tryto do this over the next several years.andP;  Some of them may overhang thetechnology--that is, try to do too much with it without the tools.andP;  So youcould see a backlash within 24 to 36 months, when people will be saying:&quot;This client/server stuff is bull.andP;  It's not just going to happen.andP;  We'regoing to back away from it.&quot;andM;That's exactly the wrong approach to take.andP;  What we're recommending toclients is that they go into an aggressive pilot mode on client/servercomputing.andP;  But they shouldn't expect to replace their minicomputers in thenext 24 months.andP;  They should be getting ready to do that in 1993 or 1994.andM;Q: Aren't most of your clients the very central IS directors who may feelthreatened by this trend?andM;A: Generally, central IS has resisted the movement.andP;  IS directors have said:&quot;This is a PC phenomenon.&quot;andP;  In fact, the word toy comes up a great deal inconversations with them about client/server computing.andM;The most enlightened IS executives have embraced the concept of client/servercomputing.andP;  General Dynamics, for example, is a company where central IS isgetting out of the business of acquiring and implementing technology.andP;  Itsrole is to act as consultants to the organization, letting departmental ISmanagers do their own thing.andP;  Most of the departmental IS there--in businessunits that make submarines and F15s, for example--is doing client/servercomputing.andM;You also see it at Ford, General Motors, United Airlines, Hughes, McDonellDouglas.andP;  .  .  .  There's probably a list of 15 companies.andP;  And then youdrop off a precipice, where central IS managers at user organizations say:&quot;Forget client/server computing guys.andP;  We're not doing it.andP;  Just stop.&quot;andP;  Sothere is a tremendous resistance when you get beyond the top 20 companies inthe United States.andM;Q: What characterizes a central IS organization that does supportclient/server computing?andM;A: It's one that sees its role as consultative, defining a very broadtop-down architecture for the company--it's going to be SNA [Systems NetworkArchitecture, IBM's communications scheme].andP;  It's going to be OSI [The OpenSystem Interconnection communications standard]--but not getting any morespecific.andM;Q: Which operating system or systems do you see playing a pivotal role inclient/server computing?andM;A: If you look out to 1992, we believe that 70% of all clients will be usingmachines based on OS/2.andP;  That's an aggressive forecast.andP;  But, remember, we'renot talking about all the PCs in the world; we're just discussing those usedin true client/server environments.andP;  About 10% will be DOS.andP;  The remainder,20%, will be UNIX--that's a lot of UNIX clients.andP;  If you look on the serverside, about 60% will be OS/2; 30% UNIX; and 10% will be VMS, MVS and theother proprietary operating systems of major systems suppliers.andM;So our scenario is very good for Microsoft.andP;  And it's very good for UNIX.andO;We're not going to call it the year of UNIX because we're not that stupid,but we think that UNIX is going to be right in the middle of this wholething.andM;Q: Through what channels will client/server solutions be delivered to users?andM;A: The major hurdle for client/server computing, the killer out there in thedark, is channels of distribution.andP;  That's because you're talking about anarchitecture that needs a lot of support and service, which most retailersdon't have.andP;  Its architecture is multivendor in nature.andP;  .  .  .  So I don'tthink there's a channel of distribution out there today that can handle thisthing.andP;  It doesn't exist.andP;  It's going to have to be invented.andP;  .  .  .  I'llinvent it for you.andM;The guys who will pull off delivery of client/server solutions arevalue-added resellers, VARS.andP;  .  .  .  These guys are going to leave theminicomputer ranks, pounding the last nail in the pine box for theminicomputer guys.andM;Q: Do you see any minicomputer manufacturers moving in this directionswiftly?andM;A: .andP;  .  .  There is a problem for these guys: the economics [of sellingcomputer hardware] has been turned on its head.andP;  You have gone from a worldwhere lock-in was critical, enabling suppliers to migrate customers through anumber of boxes.andP;  That world is completely out the window.andP;  Users can say, &quot;Idon't want your clients, your PCs.andP;  I'm going to buy them instead from, let'ssay, Dell.&quot;andM;The interesting thing is that IBM, DEC and HP could have tremendous strengthin this market because of their service and support capabilities.andM;Q: Do you see any major technology supplier attempting to change itsinfrastructure to meet the challenges of client/server computing?andM;A: You do have vendors that recognize that old world computing is not goingto happen [anymore], so they have to go with new world computing.andP;  DataGeneral, Unisys and Bull come to mind in this respect.andP;  The problem is thatas old world computing is dying, new world computing is not coming on fastenough to make up the difference.andP;  The transition is going to be four years.andO;That's a long time.andP;  .  .  .andM;We call this the &quot;gap scenario.&quot;andP;  Its chief manifestation is.andP;  .  .  .  userhibernation.andP;  There's a frustration among users that, although they'vedecided to abandon old-world computing, there's nothing to make up for it.andO;So what do they do?andP;  They hibernate.andP;  .  .  .  .  Another manifestation hasto do with complexity.andP;  Five years ago, for example, if you worked at DEC youjust worried about VMS, VAX and DECNet; now you have to worry about VMS,OS/2, DOS, UNIX and any bridges to IBM.andP;  So there's a level ofcomplexity--not only on the development side but in understanding well enoughto be able to sell them.andP;  And you also have complexity building on the userside.andP;  .  .  .  It's just increasing the frustration of users because of theinability to get things done; they almost are frozen up.andP;  .  .  .andM;We think this gap scenario is great for DEC and IBM because you are going tofind users retreating back into safe harbors.andP;  And the guys that are going tobenefit are IBM, DEC and Apple.andP;  .  .  .  Those are the suppliers that willbenefit from the gap.andP;  There are also vendors that will help users go throughthe transition during the gap.andP;  Those are people like Oracle, Sybase,NetFrame--the guys that are intimately involved in a lot of the client/serverpiloting going on at user organizations.andP;  Microsoft, Sun and ATandamp;T also are inthe group.andP;  They are helping users make the transition over the gap.andM;Q: On the software side, where is the source of programming productivity inthe client/server world?andM;A: .andP;  .  .  Let's say, for example, you want to write an order/entry softwareprogram for a lumber company.andP;  Now, you have to write a database for such anapplication.andP;  In client/server computing, the database is on the server sothat when you write your order/entry package you write for the client: theuser interface, how the screens are going to look.andP;  And you simply call onthat database when you need it--whether you bought it from Sybase,Ashton-Tate or Microsoft.andM;So what has happened is that programming has been simplified because youripped a lot of your core functions out of the application and placed them onthe server, where they can be called upon when needed.andP;  So the applicationsdevelopment, besides being very different--which requires a tremendous amountof education, will be much faster and cleaner.andP;  There will be a set ofstandards for databases and tools sitting on the server.andP;  So it's going to bea revolution in applications development.andM;The cry from users these days is for tools.andP;  The guys at McDonnell Douglas,for example, are trying to put it all together.andP;  But they lack remoteprocedure calls to link the clients and servers.andP;  They don't have the datadictionaries.andP;  They are missing all those elements needed to buildinterestate highways.andM;For the next few years, however, users are going to have [to take] theirshovels out and build these highways themselves.andP;  So it will be a period ofgreat frustration.andM;Q: After client/server computing does take hold in 1994, what will theindustry look like?andM;A: If you're a supplier, you are going to have to work harder for your money.andO;It's not going to be easy money anymore because it's [going to be] a vastlymore competitive market.andP;  Clients can be bought from anybody.andP;  Servers can bebought from anybody.andP;  So there aren't going to be any more 15% profitmargins.andM;Somebody asked me where I thought Steve Jobs was going to be in 1999.andP;  I saidhe'll be the president of the largest software company in the world becausehe was right when he designed the Macintosh, shifting the focus over tosoftware.andP;  That's where the magic is going to be.andP;  Client/server computing isnot defined by hardware.andP;  It's not two boxes.andP;  It's a software-definedarchitecture.andP;  That's where most of the revenue shift is going to go.andP;  That'swhere the creativity is going to be.andP;  It's going to be in software andnetworks.andM;That's a problem for users because they always have believed that you spend80% of your IS dollars on the box.andP;  That equation is going to flip-flop.andO;You're going to be spending most of your money on the software and thenetwork.andP;  The box is going to be an insignificant price as part of thesystem--maybe 20%.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
