(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The University of Michigan said it wouldhave suspended part of its policy on racial harassment even if a acivil rights group had not charged the policy violatesconstitutional free speech rights.   ``While we believe that the entire harassment policy canwithstand legal scrutiny, we also knew from the beginning that thepolicy would be refined and improved as we gained experience fromits implementation,'' Elsa Kircher Cole, the university's generalcounsel, said Monday.   The policy, which applies to all students enrolled at the AnnArbor school, prohibits harassment or discrimination based on race,ethnicity, religion, sex, sexual orientation, creed, nationalorigin, ancestry, age, marital status, handicap or Vietnam-veteranstatus.   The American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan filed a federallawsuit in May, saying the policy violated constitutional guaranteesof freedom of speech. The case is pending.   The suspended provision prohibits behavior in academic settingsthat creates an intimidating, hostile or demeaning environment foreducational pursuits, employment or participation in Universitysponsored extracurricular activities.   Michigan will continue to enforce its anti-harassment policyagainst behavior that victimizes an individual, the university saidin a written statement.   ``The ACLU suit has probably focused our attention on certainaspects of the policy which would have been discussed during thecontinuing review process this fall, but I have no doubt the reviewwould have led to the same outcome,'' Cole said.   The policy on discrimination was adopted in April 1988 followinga series of racial incidents on campus.   The ACLU said in its suit that the policy was intended ``tocreate a chilling effect on the expression of certain ideas becauseof the content of those ideas,'' and is too broad and vague.</TEXT></DOC>
