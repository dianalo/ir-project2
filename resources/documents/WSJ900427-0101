Even if another captive is let go, U.S. officials say,freedom for the rest remains a long shot. Though Iran'sRafsanjani and Syria's Assad are apparently working torelease others, their control over events may be limited.Officials insist the U.S hasn't pressed Israel and Kuwait tofree Shiites they hold, a major demand of the hostageholders.</LP><TEXT>   Meanwhile, Iranian hard-liners may actually have won newpower in return for Polhill's release. Revolutionary Guardveterans gain top spots in Iran's navy, and America-hatingMohtashemi, promoted to a top policy spot, publicly warnsagainst &quot;any lenient line which would lead Iran towardsurrendering to the U.S.&quot;   Israel appears to be offering to swap Shiite Sheik Obeidfor U.S. and Israeli hostages, but Jerusalem's politicalparalysis could scotch the deal.                                                                                                          EXPORT CONTROLS on Western technology loosen as the Sovietbloc crumbles.   European realignment weakens the once-dominant U.S. rolein Cocom, the body that coordinates the West's export-controlpolicies. Bush aides acknowledge that Germany is the newforce in Cocom. And the Germans' desire to greatly liberalizetrade with the East causes U.S. concern.   Pentagon chief Cheney argues that relaxing Cocom controlstoo soon could play into the hands of a Soviet Union whoseappetite for stolen Western technology isn't sated. But evenhe knows he may be fighting a losing battle. The Pentagon istoning down opposition to exports of certain mainframe andportable computers, and machine tools.                                                                                                          DEMOCRATS POSITION themselves for possible White Housebudget negotiations.   Many view the House package that is likely to pass nextweek as a bargaining ploy, not a realistic plan. Someconservatives grudgingly accept budget chairman Panetta'sargument that his plan for $11.5 billion in defense cuts andincreased domestic spending will strengthen the Houseposition should there be a budget summit. Still, the votecould be close.   House tax writers say they won't begin looking for the$13.9 billion in added taxes the plan calls for until thereis a deal with Bush. In the Senate, meanwhile, the BudgetCommittee flounders as chairman Sasser fails to forge aDemocratic consensus on defense cuts.   But GOP Sen. Grassley hints he may break party ranks andprovide a key vote for Sasser's $15 billion proposal.                                                                                                          FORMER KKK LEADER David Duke, running as a Republicanagainst Louisiana Democratic Sen. Johnston, raised $455,000-- mostly in bits of $200 or less -- during the first threemonths of 1990. But Duke's racial and ethnic views are alsoproviding Johnston with fund-raising fodder; he has retaineda direct-mail firm experienced in wooing Jewish donors.                                                                                                          HOT SEAT? Pentagon aide Craig Fields's abrupt demotionleaves other officials who advocate an activist federalindustrial policy in an exposed position. The mostvulnerable: Deputy Commerce Secretary Thomas Murrin.Presidential science adviser Allan Bromley is said to havesimilar views, but his personal ties to Bush may protect him.                                                                                                          LAWMAKERS BEGIN taking testimony Monday from DuboisGilliam, a former aide to ex-HUD Secretary Pierce. Gilliam,convicted in the housing scandal, is expected to provide newinformation on Pierce's role, and to tell how the ReaganWhite House manipulated urban grants for political friends.He is expected to focus on Pierce aides Lance Wilson andDeborah Gore Dean.                                                                                                          SHORTFALL: The junk-bond market claims another victim: theJustice Department's plan to add antitrust regulators after adecade of staff reductions. Congress cut the agency's budgetfor this year, assuming that new pre-merger filing fees wouldprovide $20 million. But with the slowdown in activity, thedepartment now expects just $13 million to $15 million -- andits hiring plans are on hold.                                                                                                          STATES EXPAND health programs while the federal governmentstalls.   Massachusetts and Hawaii have enacted universal care forthe uninsured, and Washington is experimenting with a pilotproject. About a dozen states -- including Michigan, NewYork, New Jersey, Minnesota and Vermont -- have adopted orare considering significantly broader coverage than Medicaidrequires for women and children.   Connecticut, Massachusetts, Oregon, Washington andWisconsin take the lead in long-term care while looking forways to control costs. One model lumps Medicaid funds andsocial and community service block grants together to providebetter home care.   State pressure for federal action will increase:Washington's Gardner plans to focus on health when he takesover the National Governors Association in July.
