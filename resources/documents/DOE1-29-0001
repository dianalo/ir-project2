Questions are (a) is the technology sufficientlyadvanced to ensure that radioactive wastes can be stored for 300 to 1000yr without entering into any uncontrolled area? (b) since actual experiencedoes not exist for nuclear waste disposal over this time period, canthe mathematical models developed be tested and verified using unequivocaldata? (c) how can the public perception of the problem be addressed andthe potential risk assessment of the hazards be communicated? To addressthe technical problems of nuclear waste disposal in the acid precipitationregions of the Northern Hemisphere, a project was initiated in 1984 toevaluate an alternative method of nuclear waste disposal that may notrely completely on engineered barriers to protect the public. Certainnatural biogeochemical systems have been retaining deposited materialssince the last Ice Age (12,000 to 15,000 yr). It is the authors beliefthat the biogeochemical system of wetlands and peat bogs may providean example of an analogue for a nuclear waste repository system thatcan be tested and verified over a sufficient time period, at least forthe LLW disposal problem.</TEXT></DOC>
