Supermarket shoppers also are likely to see cheese pricesclimb soon. Two of the country's biggest processors, theKraft General Foods Inc. unit of Philip Morris Cos. andBorden Inc., this month notified wholesalers of price boosts.</LP><TEXT>   Pizza makers already are feeling the cheese squeeze. Formore than two years they've battled for business bydiscounting pies while wooing customers with extra layers ofcheese. &quot;Everybody wants more and more and more {cheese}, soit puts strains on capacity,&quot; says a spokesman for Domino'sPizza Inc., based in Ann Arbor, Mich.   But rapidly rising prices for a pizza's most expensiveingredient -- nearly half the cost in many cases -- couldlead to pricier pies. &quot;It's ushering in a new era ofpricing,&quot; says restaurant analyst Caroline Levy of ShearsonLehman Brothers. &quot;Discounting in pizza will mitigate ifcheese prices continue to increase.&quot;   So far, no one wants to raise prices first.   &quot;The competition won't let you,&quot; says Jim Lewis, directorof procurement at Godfather's Pizza Inc., a 525-unit operatorbased in Omaha, Neb. Cheese is costing Godfather's 19% morethan a year ago, which translates into a 9% jump in totalingredient costs per pizza. &quot;We're not about to jeopardizequality by reducing our cheese, so there's not a lot we cando,&quot; Mr. Lewis says.   Nevertheless, if cheese costs remain high, as expected,retail prices eventually are bound to follow. Already somerestaurateurs have capitulated.   &quot;We had to raise prices on anything that has cheese,&quot; saysFrank Palermo, owner of Palermo's Italian Restaurant andamp;Pizzeria in Chicago. Cheese now costs him between $800 and$1,000 more a week. &quot;You've got to sell a lot more pizzas tomake that up,&quot; he says.   Cheese suppliers say they're seeing some pizza-parloroperators switch to imitation cheese or cheaper blends.   Already, profits are plummeting. Just last week, NationalPizza Inc., the nation's largest franchisee of the Pizza Hutunit of PepsiCo Inc., warned investors that earnings in thecurrent quarter would be down because of soaring cheesecosts. Since spring, mozzarella has gone to $1.65 a poundfrom $1.30 -- a 27% jump -- says J.J. Fitzsimmons, NationalPizza's chief financial officer. He holds the governmentlargely responsible.   &quot;Guilty as charged,&quot; replies John Campbell, the deputyundersecretary of agriculture who oversees government cheesepurchases. In fact, prices began rising shortly after thedepartment last May announced intentions to help alleviatewhat it called &quot;hardship for our dairy farmers.&quot;   The price of cheese is largely determined by that of milk-- it takes about 10 pounds of milk (slightly more than onegallon) to make one pound of cheese. Since spring, the pricepaid by cheese plants for milk has jumped nearly 10%, becausethe milk supply is shrinking. Low prices earlier this yearforced some farmers out of business, and others complain thatprices still haven't reached profitable levels.   Among other steps, the government promised to acceleratecheese purchases for the nation's school-lunch programs. Butperhaps because of that announced intention, prices rose sofast that the idea has been shelved.   &quot;We think we've had some impact,&quot; Mr. Campbell says. Whilehe notes that cheese prices typically climb this time ofyear, in advance of the high-use fall-winter holiday season,&quot;the slope is steeper than in the past.&quot; Since early thisyear, the processors' cost of cheddar cheese, a benchmark forother varieties, has climbed about 20%.   Officials say cheese prices last year were &quot;ridiculouslylow,&quot; as one put it, so that the current increase should havebeen anticipated.   Nevertheless, pizza chains weren't prepared for such a bigjump. As a result, &quot;We'll have to exercise very shrewdmanagement,&quot; says a spokesman for Pizza Hut. Similarly,Domino's spokesman, acknowledging &quot;some price pressure&quot;already, predicts more is coming. He says profit margins at atypical store could fall as much as 25% if current priceshold.   Cheese also is a major ingredient in Mexican food. Butwhile a spokesman for Taco Bell, another PepsiCo unit, says,&quot;We certainly have seen an escalation in the cost of cheesein recent months,&quot; it has no plans to pass on higher pricesto customers. A spokeswoman for Burger King Corp., thehamburger chain owned by London-based Grand Metropolitan PLC,expressed similar vows.   But consumers will begin to see higher cheese prices atthe supermarket this fall. Kraft confirms it is raisingprices an average of six cents a pound on 70% of its cheeseline. It says that for competitive reasons it didn't raiseprices on its Velveeta loaf and natural-cheese products.Archrival Borden, citing rising commodity costs, quicklyfollowed suit.   Those increases will &quot;filter down to the consumer,&quot; saysRoger Robbe, corporate director of frozen foods and dairy forSuper Valu Stores Inc., who says the wholesaler'sprivate-label cheese supplier also is raising prices.   For the near term, though, frozen pizzas sold in grocerystores probably won't cost much more. Grand Met's PillsburyCo. unit, producer of Totino's and Jeno's pizza brands, hasno plans to pass on what a spokesman calls the &quot;significant&quot;increase in its cheese costs.</TEXT></DOC>
