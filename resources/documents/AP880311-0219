The bacterium, Rhizobium meliloti, grows naturally on alfalfaroots, and mutant forms have been used to enhance plant growth inthe past.   Using the techniques of recombinant DNA, BioTechnica Inc. ofCambridge, Mass. has re-inserted the genes responsible for nitrogenuse _ nitrogen fixation _ back into the organism, giving it twocopies of the genes.   Lab and greenhouse tests indicate this will enhance alfalfayield, according to an EPA announcement when the company appliedfor permission to test 13 months ago.   EPA has an active regulatory program for genetically engineeredpesticides, but this bacterium is not a pesticide. It is the firstgenetic engineering case under EPA's authority to regulate newchemicals, and the test will precede under approval of thecompany's ``premanufacture notice'' for a new chemical.   The tests will be conducted in Pepin County, Wis., a countylying on the Mississippi River about 20 miles southwest of EauClaire.</TEXT></DOC>
