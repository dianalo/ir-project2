Physicians involved in the managementof such incidents, or in the evaluation of patients who believe theymay have sustained a significant exposure, must proceed methodicallyand with a knowledge of the most likely health outcomes. The first stepis to evaluate the problem, documenting evidence and obtaining accurateinformation on the nature and magnitude of the hazard. The second stepis to contain the problem, coordinating efforts with responsible publicand private agencies.
