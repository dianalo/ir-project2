It was only the third time the committee has rejected one of President Reagan's nominees to the federal courts; he has appointed 340 federal judges.    The committee also recommended confirmation of four district court nominees: Richard Voorhees, for the Western District of North Carolina; Karl Forester, for the Eastern District of Kentucky; Fern Smith for the Northern District of California; and Jan DuBois, for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.    Mr. Siegan, a professor at the University of San Diego Law School, was vigorously opposed by the same coalition that helped defeat Robert Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court last year. Following the Siegan nomination early in 1987, those groups made his defeat a top priority and yesterday were quick to claim victory.    &quot;The committee's action, together with the recent resignation of Ed Meese, marks the end of the Meese era in judicial selection,&quot; said Melanne Verveer, a spokesman for People for the American Way. </TEXT></DOC>
