Shultz said Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government hadpromised the OAS it would maintain a ``pluralistic'' politicalsystem, but that member states had not held the Nicaraguans to theircommitment.   Victor Hugo Tinoco, Nicaragua's vice-minister of foreign affairs,disagreed.   ``The general movement is towards discussion, towardsnegotiation,'' he said during an informal press conference. ``TheOAS has started to take a political role in ending the CentralAmerican crisis.''   Tinoco noted that Secretary-General Joao Baena Soares has agreedto a direct role in monitoring a now-stalled peace agreement betweenthe leftist Sandinista government and U.S.-backed Contra rebels.   The meeting took place under strict security despite a unilateraltruce declared for the duration of the session by leftist Salvadoranguerrillas opposed to the government of President Jose NapoleonDuarte.   Duarte, in welcoming the delegates, condemned the guerrillas andcalled for support for the overall Central American peace process,   Other topics discussed at the General Assembly included LatinAmerican debt, the U.S. concern with drug trafficking and the OAS'sown financial straits.   The OAS is nearly bankrupt because most member nations are behindon their dues. The United States, which provides the OASheadquarters in Washington, owes $41 million.   ``The member governments must decide what they want to do withthe OAS at this critical juncture in the life of the Americas,''said Baena Soares, lamenting the organization's ``critical economiccondition.''   The Brazilian was re-elected by acclamation to a second five-yearterm as OAS secretary-general.   An OAS commission has recommended that the group cut its $66million annual budget by 30 percent and fire a fourth of about 1,000staff members.   Delegates to the General Assembly will decide whether to acceptthat recommendation this week.   Shultz, who will be replaced by James A. Baker whenPresident-elect George Bush takes office in January, said he wouldpress for full funding by the U.S. Congress.   The U.S. failure to pay its full contribution has beeninterpreted by some Latin nations as an effort to reassert itsdominance over the OAS.   ``The OAS's original sin is that it was founded to further U.S.aims in Latin America,'' Tinoco said. ``But other countries aretrying to contribute a little more.''   Bosco Matamoros, a Contra spokesman who came to San Salvador topress the rebels' case, questioned Tinoco's motives.   ``They want negotiations on a biblical time scale _ to last athousand years,'' he told The Associated Press. ``They only want tostretch things out to reinforce their grip.''   At a news conference after his speech, Shultz pointed to theexclusion of Panama from a meeting of Latin American nations lastmonth as an example of the kind of diplomatic sanction that could betaken by OAS nations.   Panama, Shultz noted pointedly, was excluded from the ``Group ofEight'' because it was no longer a democracy while under Gen. ManuelAntonio Noriega's thumb.   In another speech to the assembly, Chile's foreign ministerFelipe Errazuriz reiterated the intention of Gen. Augusto Pinochet'sgovernment to hold elections in 1989. However, he said, terrorismwas the major menace to the democratic process in Chile.</TEXT></DOC>
