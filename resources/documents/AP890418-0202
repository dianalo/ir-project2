One report said 25 people were injured before police restoredorder in Maan, a town of 25,000 people 120 miles south of Amman.   Price increases are part of an agreement with the InternationalMonetary Fund to reduce budget deficits as a step towardrescheduling much of the $6 billion debt.   King Hussein's government has promised to continue low,subsidized prices for such staples as bread, milk and rice. A loafof Arabic flat bread costs less than 4 cents.   Yousef Azem, a former member of Parliament, said the protestbegan among public transport drivers, who went to schools andrallied students to demonstrate. He estimated 3,000 people wereinvolved in the protests.   A merchant said it seemed like ``the whole town participated. Iheard people chanting slogans because of the price hikes andincreases in rent. They were chanting slogans against thegovernment.''   On Sunday, the government raiserd gasoline prices 25 percent tothe equivalent of about $1.65 a gallon, imposed an annual licensefee of $370 on taxis and raised the fees for other vehicles. Pricesof cigarettes, cooking gas, alcoholic beverages and telephone callswent up by 10 to 50 percent.   Jordan imports most consumer goods and those prices have risensharply because of a devaluation early last year that reducedexchange rate for the dinar from about $3 to $1.85.   Many landlords also raised rents because of the devaluation, butmonthly wages equivalent to $185-$370 for most workers have notgone up. The government also has cut overtime and other fringebenefits for public workers.   Unemployment, almost nonexistent five years ago, has risen to 20percent by some estimates.   The crisis arose because of declines in Jordan's main sources offoreign exchange: money sent home by Jordanians living abroad andaid from Arab nations.   Azem said 25 protesters and policemen were injured Tuesday inMaan. He said the crowd stoned or burned five banks and attackedtwo police posts and several government offices.   A hotel worker in Maan said: ``About six cars were smashed. Youcan now see the traces of burned cars.'' He reported seeing severalbanks stoned and a small fire set in the entrance of one.   Officials in Maan insisted it was only a small protest anddenied any buildings had been attacked. ``A few young men afterleaving school before noontime burned tires and demonstrated, butpolice stopped them peacefully,'' said Faheem Nawayseh, deputygovernor of the region.   There was no immediate official word on casualties or arrests.   Crown Prince Hassan, acting as regent during King Hussein'svisit to the United States, flew to the town and met withresidents, advancing a planned visit by one day.   A report by the official Jordan News Agency said representativesof taxi drivers and owners met with Transportation Minister KhaledHaj Hassan in Amman and condemned ``the havoc created thismorning'' by some drivers.   It said Hassan announced that taxi fares would be increasedWednesday to compensate for the increased costs but bus fares wouldnot change.</TEXT></DOC>
