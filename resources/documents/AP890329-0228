The last time automakers' financing companies offered interestrates as low as 2.9 percent was in mid-1987.   Robert Rewey, Ford's vice president for North American sales,said the nation's No. 2 automaker made the move because car andtruck sales during the first 80 days of the year fell belowprojections.   Rewey said Ford had lowered its annual sales prediction for theindustry to 15 million cars and trucks from 15.4 million he talkedabout in early February. Sales during the first 80 days of the yearworked out to an annual rate of 14.6 million vehicles, he added.   Although consumer confidence in the economy remains high, Reweysaid, car buyers have been hesitating because of recent moves bythe Federal Reserve and large banks that have pushed up interestrates.   ``There has to be concern of the very rampant move of interestrates in the first quarter (of 1989),'' he said at a newsconference.   The prime lending rate, a benchmark rate on which many otherinterest charges are based, has increased by 1 percentage point to11.5 percent this year.   Ford's new incentive program, which expires May 31, offersconsumers the option of cash rebates, ranging from $300 to $4,000or financing as low as 2.9 percent for a two-year loan, dependingon model.   The deals are being offered on various cars carrying Ford,Lincoln and Mercury nameplates and on some Ford trucks.   General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp. also offer rebates orlow interest rate incentives on a variety of their cars and trucks.Some of the GM offers expire as early as Monday. Chrysler'sincentives run indefinitely.   There was no immediate move by GM or Chrysler to match Ford'snew incentive package.</TEXT></DOC>
