But it was no Desert Storm. In fact,if one added up all the musicians of Judas Priest, Alice Cooper, Motorhead,Metal Church and Dangerous Toys (who made up the tour) with all of theirroadies and toadies and groupies, the bottom line probably would haveoutnumbered the fans who came out to see the performance.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  METAL SHOW HEAVY ON THE CLICHES, LIGHT ONTURNOUT  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Music Review  </MEMO><TEXT>     Not really. But barely a quarter of Shoreline's 20,000 seats were filled bythe time Metal Church began the metal slugfest at about 5 p.m. And for thenext seven hours, the turnout was roughly proportionate to the quality ofmusic presented onstage.;    What is the Iraqi word for &quot;dismal&quot;?;    MetalChurch had the thankless job of opening this debacle. And it must be said thatthe group did have a raw power and energy that got the crowd -- what there wasof it -- up and moving. Vocalist Mike Howe and his mates have a trace of thepunk-based bite that they did when they started out 10 years ago, and theyused it in a set that was, if nothing else, exciting. But, in fact, there wasnothing else to Metal Church.;    Nor to Dangerous Toys, which displayed theusual metal cliches with an arena-rock slickness that was boring and annoying.The Metal Book says that every group should play noisy rock and have a shrillvocalist and guitarists who squeeze off volleys of notes. And all the troopsof Operation Rock andamp; Roll obviously have been doing their reading.;    One ofthe guys who wrote that book, Lemmy of Motorhead, was on hand for the event.In the '70s, it was Lemmy who helped to reduce metal from a viable creativeform to a sort of tag-team contest of sound. And, at this show, he was inform, shouting out his lyrics like a wino in search of a street corner.Motorhead performed with a monolithic abandon, with guitarist Wurzel providingan errant blues phrase or two to remind us where metal came from eons ago. Butfor the most part its set wasn't about songs as much as sound -- pure,ear-melting sound.;    Cooper's conviction intact;    Alice Cooper came next.Now, Cooper isn't a real metalist. He uses the style as an aural scrim onwhich he projects his theatrical visions. With metal blaring in thebackground, he entered the stage from the gaping mouth of a skull and --depending on one's tastes in such matters -- got either better or worse fromthere. At various points he hugged a snake -- the lovely and talented SaltLake Sidney -- and grabbed a &quot;fan&quot; from the crowd, strapped her onto a&quot;Frankenstein table&quot; and turned her into a monster, which he proceeded toassault and cast aside. During &quot;School's Out,&quot; he kicked a bunch of giganticballoons into the crowd, sticking them with a saber, which made them explodeinto clouds of multicolored confetti.;    Whew!;    Yes, it was silly andhokey. And in his black, studded leather tights, Cooper's stooped posture madehim look like a hilarious version of the Alien (although that creature wouldnever have worn such flashy eye makeup).;    But Cooper's garish set also camewith Cooper's songs, which made the effects worth the time and bother. &quot;I'm18&quot; is one of the teen angst classics of all time, and Cooper sang it with aconviction that masked his 43 years. And 1989's &quot;Poison&quot; was equallywonderful, not metal as much as unalloyed pop. And his new &quot;Hey Stoopid&quot; had ahook-laden grandeur that was smashing; it even survived a thorough trashingfrom guest guitarist Joe Satriani. Cooper endures because his music does thesame, and he and it made his performance a pleasure.;    A tired Judas Priest;   Judas Priest has endured, as well. But not, as it were, well.;    VocalistRob Halford came onstage on his Harley, the way he usually does. And K. K.Downing and Glenn Tipton provided the fleeting and screaming guitar licks thathave provided Priest's punch over its long career. And with its high-tech setand glaring and arcing spotlights and explosions and the rest, Priest did givethe crowd its money's worth.;    But the group seemed archaic and tired, as ifit had done one tour too many along the line. Even newer songs like &quot;A Touchof Evil&quot; and the title cut from its most recent album, &quot;Painkiller,&quot; soundedlike the Priest was playing on the sound of its past instead of tryinganything fresh.;    But then metal has never had much to do with such things.It's about street-warrior poses and the same old licks and a &quot;rebellious&quot;attitude that is oddly conservative in its conformity. In modest doses, itsvarious idiocies can be enjoyable and charming in their way.;    But sevenhours of it at one sitting was too much of a bad thing.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  HARRY SUMRALL, Mercury News Music Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910716  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  833  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday July 16, 199100198166,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
