Financial experts from both the ruling coalition and the opposition Social Democratic Party publicly declared this week that the deficit is likely to reach 40 billion marks ($24.6 billion), about 10 billion marks more than projected in the budget approved by parliament last month.    The increase is due principally to the expected loss of an estimated six billion marks in revenues from the Bundesbank, whose currency reserves have been eroded by the dollar's decline. Other factors include Bonn's increased contributions to the European Community, as well as a general decrease in tax revenues because of the country's sluggish economic growth.    Mr. Stoltenberg has scheduled a news conference for today, apparently in response to the political debate over the swelling deficit. The finance minister, a staunch opponent of budget deficits in principle, is expected to reiterate that the growing deficit is tied to Bonn's commitment to help boost world economic growth and won't expand beyond 40 billion marks.    That link to world growth has been underscored by Manfred Carstens, the chief parliamentary spokesman on budget affairs for Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Socialist Union. Mr. Carstens said on Tuesday that the increased budget deficit would give a boost to the West German economy. He also stressed that the enlarged deficit must be regarded as a temporary phenomenon and mustn't be repeated in 1989.    Nonetheless, the Social Democrats have attacked the widening deficit as symptomatic of economic mismanagement by the government. The party's parliamentary speaker on financial affairs, Dieter Spoeri, stressed yesterday that the expected deficit would exceed the ceiling allowed under German law, which, strictly speaking, limits this year's deficit to 33.4 billion marks. But deficit ceilings have been exceeded routinely in the past, and the special parliamentary authorization needed to permit such overruns has always been granted without difficulty.    Meanwhile, several newspapers usually supportive of government economic policy said yesterday that the widenening deficit is reminiscent of what they characterized as the profligate ways of the former Social Democratic leadership. And even some politicians from the ruling coalition have expressed uneasiness with the size of the deficit. </TEXT></DOC>
