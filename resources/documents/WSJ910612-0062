The Bush administration had hoped that the most urgentpart of the legislation, recapitalizing the dwindling bankinsurance fund, would provide the engine to carry the bill'sbroader, more controversial parts, such as allowing banks tounderwrite securities and insurance.</LP><TEXT>   But after a meeting yesterday afternoon between severalkey legislators and White House officials, including thepresident, several members said they believe the more urgentmatter of the insurance fund should be addressed first, andseparately. The members promised cooperation, but said theywouldn't rush the bill through by September, as PresidentBush has requested.   &quot;It's simpler to divide the question,&quot; said Rep. EdwardMarkey (D., Mass.), who heads the House Telecommunicationsand Finance Subcommittee. &quot;That's the much more desirableapproach,&quot; added Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), chairman ofthe Energy and Commerce Committee. His committee hasjurisdiction over such pivotal questions as whether banks mayunderwrite securities. He listed 11 pages of objections tothe legislation in a letter to House leadership last week.   Adding to the pressure to act on the bank fund is a steadydrumbeat of bleak news from the banking industry. Justyesterday, the General Accounting Office warned that bankinsurance fund may be exhausted in six months. CharlesBowsher, comptroller general of the congressional watchdogagency, also said that the savings-and-loan cleanup is goingto cost more than expected because of slack managementcontrols at the cleanup agency and the poor real estatemarket.   Last month, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. toldCongress that it raised to as many as 440 the number of banksit projects will fail over the next two years. Based on thoseestimates, Mr. Bowsher told the Senate Banking Committee,&quot;There is now the possibility of a negative balance in thefund at the end of the fiscal year,&quot; he said, which ends Dec.31 for the FDIC. &quot;It comes very close to exhausting&quot; thefund.   The House Banking Committee, moreover, has in place theprocedural means to split the bank insurance fund provisionsfrom the broader bill. The committee has before it two bills,both passed by subcommittee. The broader bill, endorsed bythe Bush administration, would permit banks to sell insuranceor securities, and expand branches nationwide. But if thebroader bill bogs down, the committee would quickly pass thenarrower, more urgent bill, which would simply recapitalizethe bank insurance fund. Even if the broader bill passes, itwould still have to go through the Energy and CommerceCommittee.   Meanwhile, House Banking Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez(D., Texas) said he will renew his efforts to restrict theFederal Reserve from helping poorly capitalized banks withloans from its discount window, and will push for the changeas part of a broader banking bill.   He bolstered his plan by releasing Fed data compiled byhis committee. He charged that the Fed loans, which arerepaid by the FDIC if the bank fails, amount to a &quot;backdoorbailout of failing banks.&quot;   The committee's findings showed, for example, that 377banks that received long-term credit from the Fed eventuallyfailed. Although the FDIC repays those loans to the Fed, thebank-insurance agency -- ultimately backed by the taxpayers-- absorbs those losses. The Fed has so far fought off theprovision, saying that it could interfere with its efforts tohead off disruptions in the banking system.   Meanwhile, the FDIC reported that earnings at the nation'sbanks in the first quarter fell 8.8% from a year earlier to$5.66 billion, as banks set aside more for expected lossesand as more real estate loans soured. The latest figurescompared with earnings of $6.2 billion in the first quarterof 1990 and $1.1 billion in last year's fourth quarter.   FDIC Chairman William Seidman didn't forecast quickimprovement, because bank earnings tend to lag behind thebroader economy, which is only beginning to show signs ofrecovery. &quot;I wouldn't be surprised if the second quarterlooks pretty much like the first and we don't see anylikelihood of recovery till the end of the year.&quot;   Moreover, the FDIC's &quot;problem list,&quot; measured by theamount of assets held by banks on the list, increased to $418billion from $408 billion last quarter. &quot;That's an area wewatch very carefully, because it indicates potentialfailures,&quot; he said, calling it the &quot;least favorable item&quot; onthe earnings report.   Regionally, the Northeast still is suffering the most fromreal estate lending. Banks in Washington, D.C., reported that19.32% of all real estate loans are non-current, comparedwith Massachusetts at 17.28%, and Connecticut at 18.38%.   Although not in the worst category yet, California wasamong the states with the biggest jump in troubled realestate loans, to 4.24% of real estate lending, from 2.96% theprior quarter. &quot;The concern in California is that the trendis in the wrong direction,&quot; Mr. Seidman said.</TEXT></DOC>
