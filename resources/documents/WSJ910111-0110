Castro   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>01/11/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A5C</SO><IN>BANKS (BNK)</IN><GV>FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (FDL)CONGRESS (CNG)</GV><LP>   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said it may considermaking full reimbursement of uninsured deposits at FreedomNational Bank of New York, whose liquidation in Novemberraised questions about FDIC policies.   When the FDIC closed Freedom National, one of largestblack-owned banks in the U.S., it only covered deposits of$100,000 or less. About two dozen nonprofit agencies inHarlem and Brooklyn and an unknown number of businesses haddeposits that exceeded the $100,000 insurance limit. Thosedeposits totaled about $15 million. The nonprofit groupsincluded the United Negro College Fund and the National UrbanLeague.</LP><TEXT>   The FDIC later said it would cover 50% of the uninsuredamounts, but demands from members of Congress -- especiallymembers of New York's delegation -- for full coverage grewlouder this week after the FDIC covered all uninsureddeposits in units of the much-larger Bank of New EnglandCorp.   A spokeswoman for the FDIC said the agency told Rep.Charles B. Rangel that it will &quot;try to consider&quot; the FreedomNational reimbursement issue at a board meeting next week.She said the FDIC board is also likely to discuss thepossibility that full coverage for Freedom Nationaldepositors will lead to demands for full coverage fromuninsured depositors at other failed banks.   Last year, depositors were covered in full at 140 of the156 banks that failed. The FDIC has argued that federal lawallows full coverage if the FDIC believes that other banks inthe region and the economy of a community might be in dangerif uninsured depositors, especially other banks, aren'tcovered.   Rep. Rangel, whose district includes Harlem and whosecampaign committee was one of the uninsured depositors, hasrepeatedly asked for reimbursement of all deposits. Rep.Floyd Flake, also from New York, has urged fullreimbursement.   It was unclear whether the FDIC board would consider fullreimbursement of all depositors at Freedom National or justthose who had broken up their funds into several accounts,each with balances of less than $100,000. Under its rules,the FDIC lumped such accounts together and covered only thefirst $100,000. Some nonprofit agency managers have said theybelieved each account was insured in full.   In addition, New York State Attorney General Robert Abramshas argued that accounts set up by nonprofit institutionsshould qualify as charitable trusts that are eligible forfull FDIC coverage.   Rep. Rangel said in an interview that if the FDIC decidesit does not have the authority to fully reimburse allaccounts, &quot;We'll try to legislate to give them the authorityto reverse their decision.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
