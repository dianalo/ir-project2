A prolonged period of peace and stable government holds thepromise of undreamed of prosperity for a people who have known onlyconflict and hardship since winning independence from Portugal in1975.   Angola has abundant reserves of oil, iron ore and diamonds _ manyof them untapped _ and a rich soil that could turn it into abreadbasket of Africa. It is about twice the size of Texas but has apopulation of only 8.9 million, just a million or so more than NewYork City.   But since independence and the installation of a Marxistgovernment, the country has been embroiled in guerrilla warfare thathas made development and exploitation of many of its naturalresources, particularly agriculture, difficult if not impossible.   Rene Pellisier, a French authority on Angola and author ofseveral books on the country, describes the nation's mineral wealthas ``truly astonishing,'' and says it ``should insure a viableeconomy, provided that the country can find investment, technicalskill and can recover its internal peace.''   Even before independence, Angola had been disrupted by ananti-Portuguese guerrilla war since 1961. In 1975, theanti-Portuguese guerrilla organizations split along ideologicallines. The Marxist Angolan Popular Liberation Movement took power inLuanda and the pro-Western National Union for Total Independence ofAngola, also known as UNITA, went into the bush to fight.   The Marxist government won the support of the Soviet Union, whichhas provided military supplies and advisers, and Cuba, which sent introops. UNITA's main support came from the United States and SouthAfrica.   The war has reached a virtual stalemate, and on Dec. 22, Angola,Cuba and South Africa agreed to a phased withdrawal of 50,000 Cubantroops. In exchange, South Africa agreed to grant independence toNamibia on Angola's southern border.   UNITA has vowed to continue its fight but there are signs ofnegotiations that could bring an internal settlement.   Should peace come and stable government take hold, the way willbe open for Angola to prosper as few other African nations can.   Angola's oil sector is the largest in sub-Saharan Africa afterNigeria, and conservative estimates put known reserves at 1.84billion barrels.   The 375,000 barrels a day pumped mainly by an Angolan-U.S.consortium off the Cabinda enclave near the mouth of the Congo Riveraccount for 90 percent of Angola's export earnings.   Under the Portuguese, Angola exported 5 to 8 percent of theworld's diamond production and was Africa's second-largest coffeeproducer.   Proven reserves of a billion tons of high-grade hematite iron oreremain in the Cassinga mines in southern Angola where invading SouthAfrican forces turned much of the area into a no-man's land.   Diplomats and international aid officials say that with thesigning Dec. 22 of agreements by Angola, Cuba and South Africa, afresh start could be at hand.   ``We're hoping that people who have seen Angola as a no-goproposition will come here and see some optimism,'' said Kieran J.O'Cuneen, head of the European Economic Community's developmentprogram, the largest in Angola.   Foreign experts, government officials and local expatriateentrepreneurs all recognize that the obstacles to development areenormous. Peace in the countryside and production centers isconsidered imperative if reconstruction is to begin.   UNITA is not party to the December agreements, in which theUnited States played a third-party role, says it will not lay downits arms until the Marxist government of President Jose Eduardo dosSantos in Luanda agrees to meet at the negotiating table.   The United States, which conditions its recognition of dosSanto's government on a settlement with UNITA and the completewithdrawal of Cuban troops, still is giving UNITA $15 million a yearin military aid.   South Africa says it stopped its aid to UNITA following theDecember accords. But Angola's defense minister, Pedro Maria Tonha,claims South African supplies continue to arrive at UNITA bases inthe southeastern part of the country.   The Cuban troops are to be out of Angola by July 1991. As of Jan.15, about 3,000 had left the country.   Dos Santos recently called for a cease-fire with UNITA and hasoffered a year-long amnesty beginning Feb. 4.   But the 52-year-old Moscow-educated petroleum engineer says UNITAleader Jonas Savimbi, portrayed by some as a pro-Western crusaderagainst the Marxist government, is a special case and must be dealtwith separately.   In early January, before his inauguration, President Bush wroteto Savimbi assuring him of continued U.S. support. President KennethKaunda of Zambia called on Bush to offer political asylum to the54-year-old UNITA chief, who enjoys strong conservative backing inthe U.S. Congress.   Outside experts say neither side can hope for a clear victory.   Continued clashes between the two sides since mid-January haveclaimed a reported 200 lives.   Foreign aid officials say the threat of continued UNITA attacksprevents them from making surveys to determine how much money willbe needed to underwrite key projects, such as the rehabilitation ofthe Lobito corridor.   The corridor includes the strategic Benguela railway running fromthe Atlantic port of Lobito into the heart of Africa and the coppermines of neighboring Zaire and Zambia.   Most of the 809-mile railroad has been out of commission foryears because of blown up bridges, track damage and a lack ofsecurity.   European Economic Community officials said following an aid-donorconference Jan. 26-27b in Luanda on the Lobito corridor that $20million had been earmarked for the project, whose final cost isestimated at $600 million.   Angola, which is expected to join the United Nations-affiliatedInternational Monetary Fund in June, has a $4-billion foreign debt,three-quarters of it to the Soviet Union, mainly for militaryequipment and salaries to Soviet advisers.   The IMF is expected to demand at least a 100 percent devaluationof Angola's currency, the kwanza, as a condition for membership. Butsuch a move could throw into turmoil the vital but fragile localbusiness structure, much of it run by foreigners with assests inblack market kwanzas.   Since independence the official value of the kwanza has beenpegged at 29.62 to the dollar, but the black market rate of 2,200 isthe common denominator in nearly all unofficial transactions.   Fighting in the countryside has disrupted agricultural productionand distribution. The only way to get agricultural produce to Luandafrom the relatively unscathed southwestern corner of the country isby weekly boat from the port of Namibe.   Once an exporter of food, Angola received 187,000 tons ofemergency food aid in 1987-88.   Since the internal guerrilla war broke out in 1975, more than 60percent of what Angola spends on imports has been for militarysupplies.   Not much has been left to invest in infrastructure, education,health care and agricultural and industrial development.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Feb. 5</NOTE></DOC>
