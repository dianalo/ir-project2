In a labor-intensivebusiness, it is having the best labor relations of its30-year history. It has the most efficient and lowest-costplants in the business. And it continues to innovate in plantdesign and equipment technology.</LP><TEXT>   But none of that helped much when a 50.7% stake in IBPInc., the nation's largest meatpacker, was offered to thepublic by Occidental Petroleum Corp. recently. Barely 19% ofthe stock being offered was taken up by outside investors.First Boston Corp. and Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette SecuritiesCorp., the underwriters, had to buy the remaining shares tocomplete the offering. The underwriters sold 17 millionshares to institutional investors for about $14 million, andtheir losses on the deal were estimated at about $5 million.   &quot;The investment community looked at IBP and decided atleast in the near term there's not a whole lot of potential,&quot;says Steve Kay, publisher of Cattle Buyers Weekly.   That's because investors peeked at the other side of IBP'scompetitive balance sheet. The company is in an industry --the red meat business -- that's troubled by a poor image,declining demand and large cyclical price and profit swings.Further, IBP has done little to protect itself against thosecyclical swings.   But now, independent again after nine years as part ofOccidental, IBP must reduce its reliance on the red meatbusiness and its commodity pricing, analysts and otherindustry experts insist. &quot;IBP has big modern facilities, avery sophisticated communications network, the best marketinformation anywhere and good on-line accounting controls,&quot;says a veteran meat industry executive who asked not to benamed. &quot;Their weakness is their vulnerability to commoditymargins.&quot;   IBP, which didn't return phone calls seeking informationfor this story, has always been an innovator. It built plantsfar from big-city slaughterhouses but close to Midwesternfeed yards, a move that cut transportation costs and meantthat cattle arrived heavier and less stressed. And becauseIBP could buy more land for less money in rural areas, itcould build more efficient one-story plants instead ofoperating on several floors.   By 1980, IBP had become the nation's biggest meatpacker,with net income of $53 million on revenue of $4.6 billion.Currently, IBP controls about 32% of the cattle-slaughteringbusiness and 19% of the hog-slaughtering market, estimatesSterling Marketing, a Lenexa, Kan., livestock and meatbusiness consulting and research firm. ConAgra Inc. is adistant second in both markets with 21% and 13%,respectively.   IBP has also been an obsessive cost-cutter, which made itthe low-cost producer in the industry but also led to yearsof labor strife. Between 1970 and 1980, union workers struckthe company's plants seven times. But relations have improvedlately, partly because hard times in the industry made laborunions more conciliatory and brought peace to most companies.At its headquarters plant in Dakota City, Neb., for example,the company negotiated its current three-year contractwithout a strike or lockout for the first time in the plant's24-year history.   Still, IBP's earnings haven't had nearly as much qualityas its beef products. In fact, they've been less than 1% ofsales since 1982. For the first nine months of this year, thecompany reported a loss of $10.6 million, or 22 cents ashare, on revenue of $7.86 billion. High cattle prices andstagnant beef prices squeezed margins. Last year, the companyearned $42.3 million, or 89 cents a share, on sales of $10.2billion.   A big part of IBP's problem, analysts contend, is itssingle-minded strategy: Stick to the red meat processingbusiness and continue to hack away at costs while increasingmarket share. But critics contend that gaining market sharenow costs more than it returns in profit, since weak playershave been knocked out of the business. &quot;It's kind of adeadlock,&quot; says a meat industry executive. &quot;The Big Three arebattling to prevent losing market share. None wants to be thefirst to permanently close a plant.&quot;   The solution, they contend, is product diversification.When a beef packer bragged to him about building a new plant,poultry processor Don Tyson, chairman of Tyson Foods Corp.,told a recent convention of the American Meat Institute, &quot;Iasked him, `Why don't you do more to the beef rather than domore beef?&quot;   That's what others have been doing. Monfort, MBPXL andSwift were swallowed by larger food-processing concerns suchas Cargill Inc. and ConAgra, which have diverse markets anddeep pockets to support them through bad times. Others haveeither eschewed the slaughtering business to concentrate onhigher-margin meat processing or have used the fresh meatbusiness to feed their value-added consumer products.   ConAgra, based in Omaha, Neb., recently introduced afrozen microwaveable hamburger into its Healthy Choice lineof packaged entrees. Geo. A. Hormel andamp; Co., Austin, Minn., hasdeveloped shelf-stable meats, including beef, for its TopShelf line of packaged foods.   Diversification would also help IBP gain access to capitalmarkets and increase its market value, analysts say. &quot;Tomaximize shareholders' value, you have to move up thevalue-added scale where you're working with a bigger marginthan what the commodity market gives you,&quot; says RogerSpencer, a food analyst with PaineWebber in Chicago. Analystspoint out that the high price-earnings ratios commanded byHormel, Philip Morris Cos., ConAgra and Nabisco Brands Inc.are primarily due to their valuable consumer brands.   While the company hasn't given any outward indication thatit plans any strategic changes, analysts hope that its newindependence will prompt a reassessment. &quot;Once I got out ofcollege and didn't have my parents behind me, I had to makemoney,&quot; says John McMillin, analyst at Prudential Bache Inc.IBP, sans Oxy, will have to do the same, he says.   Mr. McMillin insists that IBP can no longer add marketshare at any cost, as exemplified by its construction of twohuge plants in Nebraska and Iowa when the industry wasrunning at only 80% capacity because of low cattle and hogsupplies. &quot;They have to become more rational,&quot; he says. &quot;Youhave an industry running below capacity, and they add 5% tocapacity. It hurts everyone.&quot;   On the other hand, changing a $10 billion commodityprocessing company into a branded products producer won't beeasy, particularly since creating successful brands in acompetitive marketplace isn't a snap. In recent years, bothCargill and Monfort of Colorado (now part of ConAgra) havefailed in attempts to sell branded beef products insupermarkets. Further, with declining supplies of cattle andhogs raising prices, IBP may find such changes expensive. IBPspends 91% of its production costs to buy cattle and hogs.   Before it makes any expensive moves, IBP &quot;needs first toreap profits off its last round of investments,&quot; includingits new slaughtering plants, says William L. Roberts, alivestock industry analyst in Sioux Falls, S.D. &quot;They need toget the cash flow to invest in acquisitions of new product,market development and so on.&quot;   While market potential exists, analysts say IBP probablywon't benefit from the food shortage in the Soviet Union forsome time. If the West finds a way to increase shipments offood, it is most likely that poultry would be the firstprotein choice, says Ron Drain, president of SterlingMarketing. &quot;Poultry delivers the biggest bang for the buck,&quot;he says.   After poultry, pork would be the second choice, and ifpork shipments increase, IBP would be among those benefiting,Mr. Drain says. &quot;But we don't know what we can do and what wecan't do. All we know is their currency isn't any good,&quot; hesays.   IBP may find it difficult to raise the money elsewhere.The company is saddled with negative profit margins, a $500million debt load and annual interest payments of about $60million. &quot;The investment community just turned them down witha big no,&quot; says Mr. Kay, the newsletter publisher, referringto the failed public stock sale. &quot;And now they're so strappedfor cash, I don't know where they will get the investmentdollars.&quot;   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          UNDERWRITERS sold 17 million shares of IBP Inc. stock for$14 a share.
