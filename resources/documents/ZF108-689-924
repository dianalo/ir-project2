relatively easy to use; excellent indexing andcross-referencing; includes equation editor.andM;-Relatively poor color support; demands powerful Macintosh; doesn't importmany text formats.andM;By Bruce FraserandM;Already a best seller in the Unix world, FrameMaker 2.1 from Frame TechnologyCorp. brings to the Macintosh a much-needed level of functionality for theproduction of long documents.andP;  In doing so, it provides the first seriouschallenge to the hegemony of the Mac publishing market's &quot;big three&quot;: AldusCorp., Quark Inc. and Letraset.andM;FrameMaker integrates word processing, drawing, page-layout anddocument-management tools but is less design-oriented than competingapplications.andP;  It uses the familiar metaphor of placing text and graphics inframes, but it focuses on linking components within documents and linkingdocuments together to form books.andM;The most comparable program available for the Mac is Interleaf Publisher fromInterleaf Inc. of Cambridge, Mass.andP;  Interleaf, however, chose to keep acommon user interface across all comput-ing platforms and doesn't takeadvantage of the Mac interface or operating system like Frame-Maker does.andM;Document design.andP;  Frame-Maker separates the tasks of design and creation morethan most page-layout applications.andP;  Its documen-tation and featuresspecifically address two different groups: template users and templatebuilders.andP;  A template, either built from scratch or modified from one of themany supplied with the program, contains complete design specifications for adocument.andP;  Like other publishing programs, FrameMaker uses master pages, butyou can store up to 25 of them in each template, including both tall- andwide-oriented pages.andP;  Master pages hold the page size; margin settings; basiccolumn layout; and repeating text or graphics, such as headers and footers.andO;You can link specific columns so that, for example, the lead story on Page 1jumps to Column 1 on Page 3.andP;  For multicolumn layouts, you can choose betweenfeathering (vertically justifying) adjacent columns or aligning their baselines.andM;To help position elements, Frame-Maker offers on-screen rulers; auser-definable snap-to grid; menu commands to align and distribute objects;and a Properties command that lets you type in the height, width and positionof a frame.andM;Reference pages hold named frames that contain frequently used graphicalelements.andP;  For example, rather than redraw paragraph rules each time theyoccur in the document, you include a reference to the rule as part of aparagraph's format.andP;  FrameMaker allows up to 25 reference pages per template.andM;Templates also contain paragraph-format and character-format &quot;catalogs,&quot;which resemble style sheets but have greater power and flexibility.andO;Paragraph formats apply to whole paragraphs and are used for most formatting.andO;Character formats override the paragraph formatting for selected text.andM;Paragraph tags.andP;  Tagged paragraphs are central to FrameMaker.andP;  Every kind ofparagraph used in a FrameMaker publication should have predefined formattingspeci-fications (tags) associated with it.andP;  By making extensive use oftemplates and the tags, writers can concentrate on writing, editing andcross-referencing while designers work on design.andP;  Final formatting andlayout becomes largely automatic.andM;FrameMaker's paragraph formats contain the usual specifications, such asindents, space before and after, font, font size and leading (in 0.001-pointincrements), alignment, and tabs.andP;  However, FrameMaker's formats also includemore-complex settings, such as starting points for paragraphs (top of column,top of page and top of left page); maximum number of orphans and widows;maximum, optimum and minimum word spacing; shortest word, prefix and suffixpermissible in hyphenation; and maximum number of consecutive hyphens.andM;You can create and name multiple, auto-numbered series and use anycombination of numbers, letters and Roman numerals for numbering paragraphs.andO;FrameMaker updates the numbers when you move or delete numbered paragraphs.andM;Font handling.andP;  FrameMaker's method of handling fonts is unusual.andP;  Fonts arespecified by family, angle, weight and variation separately.andP;  Variation comesinto play with families that have condensed, extended or compressed versions,such as Helvetica or Futura.andP;  FrameMaker can simulate bold and oblique stylesfor fonts that lack them; it won't, however, simulate extended or condensedvariations.andP;  You can choose underline, strikethrough, overline, superscript,subscript, outline and shadow styles, but you can't specify all caps or smallcaps.andM;Some users may find the program's spacing conventions idiosyncratic.andP;  InFrame-Maker, leading is the amount of extra space between lines rather thanthe distance between base lines.andP;  To specify 11-point type on 13 points ofleading, you choose an 11-point font and add 2 points of leading.andP;  You alsocan specify a positive or negative percentage of spread.andP;  (Zero percent isthe font's default spacing value.) Spread serves for both pair kerning andtracking.andM;Intelligent links.andP;  Much of Frame-Maker's power lies in the intelligent linksit allows within and between documents.andP;  Typically, each chapter in a book iscre-ated as a separate FrameMaker document, but lists, indexes,cross-references and tables of contents can be generated for the whole bookby using versatile text links called markers.andM;Markers are special non-printing symbols inserted into text.andP;  The programdefines markers for index, subject, author and glossary lists, and itincludes 15 other markers that you can adapt to your own purposes.andP;  Indexentries can be as simple as a single word followed by a page number, or theycan include multiple entries, multiple levels, page ranges and references toother index entries.andP;  You also can control the sorting order of indexes andset up multiple index streams by using different markers.andM;You mark cross-references similarly.andP;  When you insert other cross-referencemarkers later, they link back to the source marker.andP;  Frame-Maker doesn'tupdate cross-references until asked to do so.andP;  Simple command strings let youspecify formatting for index entries or cross-references as you enter theircontent.andM;Yet another kind of marker is used to anchor frames of graphics or text.andO;When the text to which a frame is anchored moves, the frame moves with it.andO;Anchored frames can be positioned within a line; below the current line; orin the left, right, inside or outside margin.andP;  You can use anchored frames tohold small graphics, to keep figures with their associated text, or to holdcall-outs and subheads in the margins.andM;In addition to markers, FrameMaker uses systemwide and user-definedvariables.andP;  Systemwide variables include page num-ber, page count, date,document creation date, modification date and file name.andP;  User-definedvariables are place holders for strings of text, much like a word processor'sglossary.andM;FrameMaker can create lists, such as tables of contents, indexes and tablesof figures,by using either paragraph tags or markers, but it also cangenerate lists for use in document management, such as lists of importedgraphics or of fonts used.andM;Word processing.andP;  Template users will experience FrameMaker mostly as a wordprocessing and drawing application.andP;  As a word processor, its WYSIWYGenvironment is fast enough to keep up with all but the speediest typists.andO;Formats are easily called up from the catalog windows, menu bar or keyboard.andO;FrameMaker provides a wealth of keyboard shortcuts that makes even Micro-softWord look poor in comparison.andM;The spelling checker and the Find/Change features are particularly strong.andO;The spelling checker not only looks for misspellings and suggestsalternatives but also finds repeated words and misplaced punctuation.andP;  Inaddition to FrameMaker's permanent dictionary, you can create site, personaland document-specific dictionaries.andM;The Find/Change command can search for and replace text, paragraph orcharacter tags, untagged character formats, Clipboard contents, markers,cross-references and anchored frames.andP;  It also allows a wide range ofwild-card searches.andP;  Attention to detail shows in the Clone Case button,which ensures that a search-and-replace operation will maintain correctcapitalization.andP;  Frame-Maker's &quot;smart&quot; quotes feature is also nice because,unlike most others, it's easily overridden when you need to type straightquotes to denote feet and inches or minutes and seconds.andP;  There's also anoption to suppress double spaces as you type.andM;For technical publishing, FrameMaker offers point-and-click equation buildingand editing using a palette of symbols, operators and delimiters.andP;  It alsohas some basic solving capabilities built in: You can combine fractions, addor multiply expressions, and evaluate integrals and derivatives.andM;FrameMaker can import text-only files and files in FrameMaker's own MakerInterchange Format and Maker Markup Language format, but it won't importformatted files from word processors.andP;  It will, however, open MacWrite andMicrosoft Word files directly, preserving formatting information, includingstyle sheets.andP;  Optional filters are available for popular word processingformats on other platforms, including Document Content Architecture, RTF,WordStar and WordPerfect.andM;Graphics tools.andP;  FrameMaker's drawing tools, while more complete than thosein most page-layout programs, are no substitute for a full-blown graphicsprogram.andP;  The drawing palette sports the standard tools, including a Beziercurve, all with line widths from 0.015 to 360 points.andP;  Pens and fills arechosen from eight shades of gray and seven patterns.andP;  Lines can have avariety of arrowheads and butt, round or projecting caps.andP;  Menu commands letyou group and ungroup objects, align or distribute them, change theirstacking order, scale or rotate them in 90-degree increments, and smooth andunsmooth polygons.andM;FrameMaker imports graphics in MacPaint, PICT, Encapsulated PostScript, TIFFand Sun Rasterfile formats.andP;  You can import a copy of the file into thedocument or import only a reference to the file's name and location.andP;  Thelatter method has two advantages: It creates a smaller Frame-Maker file, andany changes made to the graphics file appear automatically in FrameMaker eachtime you open or print the document.andP;  Imported color bit maps will print incolor on a color PostScript printer, but FrameMaker does only spot-colorseparations, so full-color images must be separated and stripped in manually.andM;Conclusions.andP;  Although FrameMaker has a rich and complex feature set, itadheres closely to the Mac user interface; for such a complex product, it'sremarkably easy to use.andP;  Elements that normally would be dialog boxes, suchas those for setting paragraph and character formats, are modeless windowsthat can be left open and on-screen while you work.andP;  However, doing so almostdemands a 19-inch monitor.andM;FrameMaker places other demands on hardware.andP;  While basic word processing andediting can be done on a Macintosh Plus with 2 Mbytes of RAM and a hard disk,building long documents with graphics requires an SE/30 or Mac II-familymachine with at least 4 Mbytes of RAM.andP;  The complete program, templates andsupport files occupy more than 5 Mbytes of disk space.andP;  Versions ofFrameMaker run on a large number of Unix platforms, including workstationsfrom Digital Equipment Corp., the Apollo Systems division of Hewlett-PackardCo., NeXT Inc., Silicon Graphics Inc. and Sun Microsystems Inc., and itoffers file compatibility between platforms.andM;FrameMaker's support of color is rudimentary.andP;  It has spot-color layers forblack, white, red, green, blue, cyan, magenta and yellow, but it's not up tothe color WYSIWYG standards of other Mac page-layout software.andM;FrameMaker is not particularly well-suited to short, design-intensiveprojects such as newsletters and magazines, so it's probably overkill for themajority of layout tasks being done today on Mac.andP;  But for long, highlystructured documents, its capabilities far surpass those of other Macprograms.andP;  FrameMaker isn't for everyone, but on projects that demand thekind of power it offers, it should pay for itself quickly.andM;Frame Technology Corp. is located at 1010 Rincon Circle, San Jose, Calif.andO;95131;
