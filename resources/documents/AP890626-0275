The court unanimously reinstated a lawsuit against NorthwesternBell Telephone Co. by Minnesota consumers. The civil suit accusedthe utility of violating the federal Racketeer Influenced andCorrupt Organizations Act, or RICO.   Congress may have passed the RICO law because of ``the perceivedneed to combat organized crime,'' Justice William J. Brennan saidfor the court. ``But Congress for cogent reasons chose to enact amore general statute, one which, although it had organized crime asits focus, was not limited in application to organized crime.''   In another case, the high court agreed to set guidelines on whenemployers may withdraw recognition of a labor union after hiring newworkers to break a strike.   The RICO case, which accused Northwestern Bell of bribing statepublic utility officials, had been dismissed by the 8th U.S. CircuitCourt of Appeals.   The appeals court ruled that the phone company's customers failedto prove ``a pattern of racketeering activity'' required to make acase under RICO.   The consumers claim that the utility began in 1981 illegalattempts to win rate increases by offering gifts, employment andother favors to members of the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission.   The 8th Circuit said a single fraudulent scheme is insufficient,ruling that at least two schemes must be alleged.   But Brennan rejected that argument, saying that to prove apattern of racketeering activity, a private plaintiff or aprosecutor must show at least two criminal acts ``within a singlescheme that were related and that amounted to, or threatened thelikelihood of, continued criminal activity.''   Other federal appeals courts have allowed civil RICO suits basedon numerous acts advancing only one fraudulent scheme.   RICO claims are often found in lawsuits involving virtually anybusiness dispute. The stigma attached to being linked in publiccourt documents to alleged racketeering can be powerful leverage forout-of-court settlements.   Winners of RICO cases may collect triple damages and lawyer fees,which generally are not available under state anti-fraud laws.   Justice Department lawyers, in court papers submitted last year,sided with the phone customers, urging a broad interpretation of theRICO law.   Also backing the customers were 14 states: Arizona, California,Connecticut, Idaho, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, NorthCarolina, Oregon, Texas, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin andWyoming.   But other interests urged the high court to bar the lawsuit. TheAFL-CIO, for example, said that ``private civil RICO actions havebecome a tool of harassment ... against legitimate businesses andlabor organizations.''   In the strike-breaker case, the court agreed to hear a Bushadministration appeal of a ruling stemming from a 1979 strikeagainst a Texas laboratory supplies company.   Curtin Matheson Scientific Inc. was struck in 1979 by workers atits Houston warehouse after a union contract expired and the companylocked out all 27 Teamsters union members employed there.   Five of the 27 employees crossed the picket line when the strikebegan June 13, 1979, and 12 days later, the company hired 29 newemployees to replace the remaining 22 strikers.   When the union later offered to end the strike under termspreviously offered by management, the company withdrew the offeralong with its recognition of the union as the workers' bargainingagent.   The National Labor Relations Board in 1987 said the companyillegally withdrew its recognition of the union but the 5th U.S.Circuit Court of Appeals overruled the board last November.   In other decisions announced Monday, the high court:   _Ruled, 7-2, that skyrocketing punitive damages awards inpersonal injury lawsuits do not violate the Constitution's ban onexcessive fines. The decision left open the possibility that suchhefty awards violate due-process rights.   _Ordered a lower court to restudy a dispute over drug and alcoholtesting for transit workers employed by the SoutheasternPennsylvania Transportation Authority.   _Decided to review a decision requiring W.S. Kirkpatrick andamp; Co., aNew Jersey corporation, to defend itself against allegations that itbribed Nigerian government officials to win a contract to develop anaeromedical center.   _Let stand a ruling that CBS Inc. no longer enjoys trademarkprotection for the ``Amos `N' Andy'' radio and television shows.</TEXT></DOC>
