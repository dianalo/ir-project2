Meyer, the new chief executiveofficer of Cincinnati Milacron Inc., wants to lead awolfpack.   He holds up the logo for his strategy -- a circle ofwolves, flanked on each side by a fierce wolf's head. &quot;It'snot a joke to us,&quot; he said. &quot;Wolves are survivors. They workin teams, and they go out to kill.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Milacron clearly needs to act more like a wolfpack if itis to regain its position as a world leader in factorymachinery. Japanese producers now dominate the U.S. machinetool industry, which Milacron once led. Foreign concernssupply more than half of the nation's plastics machinery. AndMilacron hasn't earned an acceptable profit since 1981.   Determined to reverse that slide, Milacron executives aimto rebuild the company's ability to manufacture qualityproducts more cheaply than competitors. It's a return tobasics after a decade when Milacron, like some other U.S.manufacturers, tried to rely on old customer loyalties, hightechnology and marketing gimmicks, only to find itself beatenout of traditional markets by foreign competitors.   Operation Wolfpack includes a crash redesign of Milacron'smachines over the next five years to make them cheaper tomanufacture and more reliable. Minimum goal: a 30% costreduction on each machine.   Already, Milacron is achieving some early successes. Aredesigned line of plastic injection molding machinery isreclaiming market share from foreign competitors. ToyotaMotor Corp. will install three of the new machines in itsGeorgetown, Ky., auto plant next year. And a new machiningcenter that costs $74,999 but has more features than the$112,000 machine it replaces is meeting the Japanese head on.   A second part of the strategy, creating &quot;focus factories&quot;that engineer, manufacture and service one product line, hasproved to be harder than expected. So far, the change hascost more in disrupted production than it has contributed insavings, but it appears that it is about to start paying off.   However, it won't be easy to turn Milacron managers intowolves. While the 106-year-old machinery producer is loadedwith competent professionals with a great depth ofmanufacturing expertise, they've operated in a bureaucraticand paternalistic environment for decades. And Milacron'stoughest foes, the Japanese and Germans, are acknowledgedworld masters of manufacturing.   &quot;Operation Wolfpack can produce a terrific company if it'swell-executed, but the results won't be evident until themid-90s,&quot; predicted Eli S. Lustgarten, machinery analyst withPaineWebber Inc. Shareholders will see some disappointmentswhile it's being implemented, as Caterpillar Inc.shareholders have with that company's &quot;Plant With a Future&quot;program, he said. The Peoria, Ill., construction-equipmentproducer has had erratic earnings during a major upgrade offactories.   Erratic earnings wouldn't be anything new for Milacron.The company had losses in three of the last eight years, andprofits in the other five averaged an anemic 2.5% of sales.Management in June had to make a public stock offering torebuild the balance sheet in preparation for the $250 millionit intends to invest over the next five years to implementthe Wolfpack program.   Mr. Meyer isn't promising a quick turnaround, but he doesexpect the 1990 second half to be better than the dismalfirst six months, when profits plummetted 63% to $5.6million, or 22 cents a share. Nonetheless, analysts expect1990 net to drop below 1989's weak $17.5 million, or 72 centsa share, on sales of $850.6 million.   Ironically, Milacron's problems arose in part becausemanagement took too long a viewpoint, unlike many other U.S.companies that worried too much about quarter-to-quarterprofits. A decade ago, the company plunged into robotics andcomputeraided manufacturing when those new technologiesseemed poised to revolutionize manufacturing. Milacronstarted producing computers, wafers for computer chips, andhuge unmanned manufacturing systems.   Milacron's big, beige computer-controlled machinesattended by bright yellow robots were the hit of manyindustry trade shows. Unfortunately, few factory owners couldafford to shell out $10 million to $20 million to buy thesystems, while those who could were reluctant to gamble onthe new technology. The result: Milacron lost millions ofdollars, while the Japanese seized the lion's share of theU.S. market for standard machine tools.   &quot;We abdicated the standard machine tool market that usedto be Milacron's strength,&quot; admitted the 53-year-old Mr.Meyer, who is the first outsider to head Milacron since theGeier family bought a controlling interest in 1887.   In the process, the company also lost the respect of somecustomers. One Midwest manufacturer said the Milacronmachining center he bought several years ago &quot;operated in therange of 30% of the time.&quot; Despite repeated visits fromMilacron repairmen, &quot;the hydraulic system wouldn't work, thetool changer wouldn't change tools, or it would change to thewrong tool. Eventually we sold it to a used machinerydealer,&quot; he said.   Unwilling to risk that &quot;tragic experience&quot; again, themanufacturer earlier this year selected a new lathe made byOkuma Machinery Works Ltd., Oguchi, Japan, without evenevaluating a competing Milacron machine.   To be sure, Milacron's problems weren't all of its ownmaking. A doubling of machine tool demand in 1978 and 1979,when U.S. car makers were downsizing in response to soaringgasoline prices, forced some U.S. manufacturers to tryforeignmade machines for the first time. Then the soaringvalue of the dollar in the first half of the 1980s made iteasy for overseas competitors to expand their beachhead byunderpricing U.S. producers.   In just 10 years from 1976 to 1986, machine tool importssoared sevenfold, seizing half the U.S. market. Japaneseproducers, pricing at whatever level it took to make a sale,bought their way into factories that previously wouldn't evenlook at their machines. The quality of those machines broughtrepeat orders.   Their next step was U.S. production. The Mazak plant inFlorence, Ky., owned by Yamazaki Mazak Corp. of Oguchi,Japan, is more automated than any owned by Milacron. Addinginsult to injury, Mazak and Okuma, which has a new plant inCharlotte, N.C., each regards the other as their primarycompetitor in the U.S. market.   Milacron's new back-to-basics approach emphasizes quality,cost reduction and return on capital. &quot;Profitability is a newreligion around here,&quot; said Raymond E. Ross, senior vicepresident, industrial systems. Indeed, even the company'scafeteria has become a profit center, catering weddings andbanquets. And Milacron's research and development program now&quot;has a small r and a capital D,&quot; said Mr. Ross. Milacron willno longer carry out research simply &quot;because it is a goodthing to do technologically.&quot;   Milacron also has altered its old approach of buildingmachines to a potential customer's wish list. &quot;Ask a customerwhat he wants, and you'll build a Rolls-Royce,&quot; saidChristopher C. Cole, Milacron's group vice president, machinetool products. &quot;But when he looks at the price tag, he maydecide to buy a Chevrolet.&quot;   The product redesign effort was pioneered by Milacron'splastic injection molding machine division. A team thatincluded people from production, purchasing and sales, aswell as engineering, &quot;looked at every competitor in theworld, from design concepts they used to the materialsemployed,&quot; said Harold Faig, vice president and generalmanager of the unit. &quot;We got away from the not-invented-heresyndrome,&quot; borrowing the best concepts found anywhere in theworld. Soliciting assistance from suppliers turned them intopartners.   The effort slashed manufacturing costs 40%, partly byhalving the number of parts required. Now the division isgoing after the production process, trying to take out anadditional 15% of the cost by automating parts-making andstreamlining assembly.   Customers have noticed a real difference. &quot;They've becomevery price-competitive, the machines perform well and theservice is great,&quot; said John Halula, group vice president ofthe plastics unit of Worthington Industries Inc., Columbus,Ohio. &quot;And the machines are U.S.-made, which we like.&quot;   Milacron's focus factory concept attempts to capture theentrepreneurial spirit more common in smaller companies. JohnE. Lower said he runs the 400-person turning machine plantoutside Wilmington, Ohio, &quot;as an autonomous company.&quot; He doeshis own purchasing and controls machine design and pricing.He's also responsible for installing the metal-cutting lathesthe factory produces and for subsequent repair service. Mostof those functions previously were controlled fromCincinnati.   Out in the factory, he has moved 120 machines in 10 monthsto create production cells. Each does all the machining on afamily of parts, which greatly improves efficiency. Nowadays,the facility delivers 90% of its machines on time, double thepercentage of a year ago. And Mr. Lower expects the plant toturn a profit this year, after a lengthy string of lossesthat almost prompted Milacron to close it.   Looking ahead, Mr. Lower plans to broaden the product lineto include smaller, simpler turning machines used by smallfactories, a market Milacron had abandoned.   &quot;That's a wolfpack project,&quot; he said.</TEXT></DOC>
