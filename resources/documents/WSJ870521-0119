The payment settled a claim by Welch that over a 21-month period it had been improperly billed for thousands of uncompleted long-distance phone calls.    Welch's controller, Jack Kuttin, believes many long-distance customers don't realize they may be getting billed for calls they dial that go unanswered. Nationwide, such overbillings &quot;could add up to a lot of change,&quot; he says.    The long-distance phone industry and its customers are in a battle over billing for unconnected phone calls. The issue has produced a spate of lawsuits, claims that individuals and businesses have been taken for millions of dollars, and cries of coverup by some irate customers. California regulators are so concerned that they are considering barring many long-distance companies from billing for perhaps a quarter of their traffic.    The long-distance companies concede there are bugs in their billing systems. But they say that the woes aren't their fault and that the problems are being resolved. Some carriers also argue that they may be the biggest victims of the billing snafus and darkly suggest that some of their customers are robbing them.    The battle stems from the end of American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.'s monopoly on phone service and seems to plague only ATandamp;T's long-distance competitors. Before the breakup, ATandamp;T had developed through its local phone companies a sophisticated system known as &quot;answer supervision&quot; to determine with almost complete accuracy when a ringing phone call was answered. When long-distance competitors started popping up, they weren't able to obtain access from the Bell system to the same answer-supervision capabilities. So each had to come up with its own way of telling when a call was answered.    Methods include setting a time limit on rings -- generally ranging from 30 seconds to more than a minute -- after which the long-distance company assumes a call has been completed. Thus, if a carrier's &quot;ring time&quot; is set at, say, 30 seconds, and the caller lets the phone ring for 31 seconds (about six rings), the caller could get billed for a one-minute phone call -- even if no one answers. (Many major phone companies, including ATandamp;T, round up to the nearest minute when billing.)    The potential for billing errors is huge. One-minute phone calls account for nearly 25% of all long-distance calls, and an even higher percentage of business calls, many of which simply involve leaving a message, says Robert Self, an author and consultant on the telephone business.    How many of those one-minute calls are misbilled is an open question. Long-distance companies say that misbilled calls aren't a big problem, but they add that precise data on error rates, customer complaints and refunds either aren't kept or are proprietary.    Robert Schwartz, vice president of Bill Correctors Inc., a San Rafael, Calif.-based company that tries to get refunds for clients due to billing mistakes, says refunds for ring/no-answer calls range from 3% to 12% of overall charges. &quot;If (phone) companies are willing to give that much, I assume their error rate is even higher,&quot; says Mr. Schwartz. Phone companies say it only reflects a generous refund policy.    A 1983 study by a Washington, D.C.-based consumer group found error rates ranging from 3% to 32% on several hundred brief calls it made through various carriers. In that same study, however, the group found that it wasn't billed for a like number of calls that were answered but lasted a minute or less, apparently due to the same imprecisions in the companies' monitoring systems.    Some carriers argue that errors in the customers' favor may roughly balance out mistakes the other way. &quot;Some people are trying to make a mountain out of a molehill on this issue,&quot; says a spokesman for MCI Communications Corp., the largest of ATandamp;T's long-distance competitors.    Don't tell that to Stan Schuttpelz, who runs an importing business in Rancho Mirage, Calif. He says when he called MCI to question some one-minute phone calls on his bill, a customer-service representative &quot;told me all about this problem the company was having with unconnected phone calls. When I called a second time I was told she no longer worked there and that she had been telling customers things she shouldn't.&quot;    Mr. Schuttpelz says he has dropped MCI as his carrier and is planning to switch to ATandamp;T. &quot;I really hated ATandamp;T's monopoly and rooted for these competing companies,&quot; he says. &quot;But I think I deserve some customer satisfaction.&quot;    Long-distance carriers mention unconnected calls in customer mailings, though critics question the adequacy of such warnings. MCI, for instance, tells a customer to call the company if he or she has been billed incorrectly for any one of a number of things including calls not answered. The message is in very small type at the bottom of the last page of a monthly newsletter mailed with the bill. A similar message, in larger type, is also put in a kit sent to new customers.    Customers who know about the problem can cheat. Mr. Self, the consultant, says a woman he knows brags of getting refunds on short calls completed by her law firm. &quot;She tells her carrier that lawyers are too long-winded to possibly have conversations under one minute,&quot; says Mr. Self.    Chris Hoppin, a spokesman for ITT Corp.'s long-distance unit, U.S. Transmission Systems Inc., says some customers routinely try to get all their one-minute calls credited. &quot;It isn't just a situation of companies ripping off people,&quot; he adds. Companies say their refund policies toughen for customers who make such blanket or repeated requests.    Besides this guerrilla-like warfare with individuals, long-distance companies have been fighting broader battles. An estimated 20 lawsuits have been filed against carriers around the country, seeking refunds and charging them with, among other things, fraud and misrepresentation. Customers have also complained to the Federal Communications Commission. But the FCC has ruled that the carriers' notification and refund policies are adequate to take care of the problem.    Then there is California. Late last year, Harvey Rosenfield, a Santa Monica-based consumer advocate, persuaded the state public-utilities commission to issue a preliminary order stating that if long-distance companies couldn't show the same &quot;error-free&quot; service as ATandamp;T, the companies couldn't bill for any one-minute phone calls within the state. Such a move could drive all of ATandamp;T's competitors out of the state, says a spokesman for US Sprint, a joint venture of GTE Corp. and United Telecommunications Inc. (MCI would say only that substantial revenue could be lost.)    The carriers immediately objected, saying they didn't get a chance to make their case before that ruling. The commission has agreed to gather more evidence before making a final decision.    Long-distance companies say the billing problem is diminishing as so-called equal access spreads across the U.S. Under equal access, local phone companies offer all carriers the same services -- including answer supervision -- that ATandamp;T has. The FCC says about 70% of the country now has equal access, and that number should rise to close to 100% by 1990.    But some critics argue that the problem won't disappear even with equal access. For instance, evidence in the California case indicates that some carriers don't fully use the more expensive answer supervision available under equal access.    Says the US Sprint spokesman: &quot;You can bet the misbilling problem is going to be with us&quot; for a while. </TEXT></DOC>
