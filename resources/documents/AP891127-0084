Final results were not expected until Tuesday, but thepresidential candidate of the ruling Socialist Party, formerly theCommunist Party, conceded that voters Sunday approved thereferendum backed by opposition parties.   ``We can be certain that the number of `yes' votes was higherthan the `no' votes,'' said Imre Pozsgay, the popular Socialistcandidate.   The results would mean that a new democratic Parliament, to bechosen by June, will elect the president of the new Hungarianrepublic. If voters had rejected the referendum, they would haveelected a president directly on Jan. 7.   Opposition groups favored postponing the vote until afterparliamentary elections, saying that otherwise they could notsufficiently organize a serious challenge to Pozsgay. They hope towin strong representation in the new Parliament, giving theircandidate a better chance at the presidency.   They also proposed that the president's powers be curtailed.   With 91.3 percent of the ballots tallied, 50.2 percent favored adirect election before the parliamentary elections and 49.8 percentwere for postponement until afterward, said Pal Kara, secretary ofthe referendum committee in parliament told journalists.   Kara said the voted yet to be counted could swing the vote theother way. Final results were not to be made public before Tuesday,he said.   The turnout represents 58.2 percent of Hungary's 7.8 millioneligible voters, Kara said _ above the 50 percent needed to make tovote binding.   The plebiscite is the first free vote in Hungary sinceCommunists came to power more than four decades ago.   It comes just a month after a new republic was declared in asymbolic rejection of Communist rule and Parliament adoptedlegislation opening the way for the free multiparty elections.   The turnout marked ``an important step'' in the country's drivefor democracy, said Tibor Vidos, the executive director of theopposition Free Democrats. ``It shows people are interested indeciding their own future.''   The ruling Socialist Party _ which replaced the recentlydissolved Communist Party _ and several other opposition groups hadagreed on direct voting for the first president of the republicbefore the parliamentary elections.   However, the League of Free Democrats and three other groupsexpressed concern that if Pozsgay won in early presidentialelections, too much power could be concentrated with the rulingSocialists before a democratic Parliament can been chosen.   They gathered more than 100,000 signatures on a petition callingfor the referendum.   The powers of the new presidency include commanding the armedforces, calling elections and dissolving Parliament.   Three other questions on the ballot dealt with traditionalaspects of the governing party's power.   _ Whether the Workers' Militia, created to protect the party,should be dissolved;   _ Whether the party should remove its organizational cells fromthe workplace;   _ And whether it should make a public accounting of its assets.   With the militia in the process of being dissolved, Parliamentvoting against continued politization of the businesses andfactories and agreement to open Socialist Party books, voting onthe latter three issues was purely symbolic.</TEXT></DOC>
