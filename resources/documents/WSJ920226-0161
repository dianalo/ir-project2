But a Raytheon unit, Amana Refrigeration Inc., is tryingto break its ties to Cooper Distributing Co. And such a movecould devastate Mr. Cooper's firm in Newark, N.J.</LP><TEXT>   Like many other small companies, Cooper Distributing hasbuilt a profitable business by tying its fortunes to a muchbigger company. Mr. Cooper says his company's annual saleshave increased more than sixfold, to $23.5 million for thefiscal year ended last Sept. 30, since 1975. Mostly, he says,that's because of a pact to distribute Amana appliances inparts of New Jersey and New York. Amana accounted for 85% ofCooper's sales last year.   But now, Cooper and Amana are adversaries in Newarkfederal court. Instead of distributing only appliances,Cooper now has a press agent distributing Amana-bashing newsreleases. &quot;The dangling ax remains hanging over my company,&quot;Mr. Cooper says in one. &quot;But I'm determined not to be thenext victim in the bloodletting that Amana has perpetrated onits loyal distributors countrywide.&quot;   Mr. Cooper figures his company, with only 18 employees,stands to win sympathy, at least, in its battle withRaytheon, which had 1991 sales of $9.27 billion. (Of that,$998 million came from appliance lines, including Amana.)   Raytheon, based in Lexington, Mass., is keeping a lowprofile, referring inquiries on the dispute to Amana. Amanasays it &quot;will ultimately prevail&quot; but otherwise declines tocomment.   Last year, Raytheon Chairman Dennis J. Picard said thecompany was moving to strengthen its appliance operations --consisting of Caloric and Speed Queen brands as well asAmana. The group had reported an operating loss of $8 millionin 1990, despite profits at Amana. &quot;We're going toconsolidate, we're going to improve our distributionchannels, and we're going to attack costs for increasedefficiency,&quot; Mr. Picard said. Later, the company reported amodest pretax operating profit of $5 million for appliancesfor 1991.   Until recently, Amana-bashing would have seemed likeself-flagellation at Cooper. For 30 years, the two companieshad enjoyed an amicable relationship -- until Amana last yearannounced a divorce.   &quot;Suddenly, Amana decided it did not need or want Cooper,and terminated it on a few days' notice,&quot; says Judge MaryanneTrump Barry. She has issued a preliminary order preventingAmana from completing the rupture. At issue is whether NewJersey franchise law, which bars terminations of franchiseesexcept for &quot;good cause,&quot; applies to Cooper.   David J. Kaufmann, a franchise-law specialist in New York,says the dispute points up a troubling issue in distributionand franchising: termination rights. Termination ornonrenewal of a franchise can destroy a small business; mostfranchise contracts spell out when and how terminations mayoccur. Yet increasingly, states try to impose their ownrules. New Jersey's franchise law has been held to apply tomany distribution arrangements, but not all, Mr. Kaufmannsays.   Until recently, Mr. Cooper had little reason to fear forhis future with Amana. His late father founded CooperDistributing in 1931; it became an Amana distributor in 1961.In 1982, Amana expanded Cooper's territory to New York City.William Cooper and his wife regularly attended Amanaconventions at Florida and Arizona resorts, and they tooktheir customers to the golf tournaments that Amana, based inIowa, sponsored in that state. &quot;Being an Amana distributorwas like being part of a family,&quot; Mr. Cooper says.   But as Raytheon, which had acquired Amana in 1965, playedan increasingly active role in its operations during the lastdecade, the family feeling diminished, Mr. Cooper says. Soonthere were no more golf tournaments. Mr. Cooper says hewatched this transition for years -- but it wasn't until lastMay that he first felt threatened.   That's when Amana, he says, decided to allow P.C. Richardandamp; Son, a Long Island, N.Y., retailer, to buy appliancesdirectly from the factory, cutting out Cooper as themiddleman and thus keeping more profit for itself. This wasCooper's biggest account, Mr. Cooper says. &quot;We were quiteupset. We had built up the account.&quot; Mr. Cooper says he tooka plane to Iowa and confronted top Amana officials, but gotno concessions. On the way home, &quot;I just felt in a daze, Iwas shocked,&quot; he says. In June, Cooper had a lawyer writeAmana, alleging that it would be unlawful to take awayCooper's account. But Amana disagreed, Mr. Cooper says, andin August it began its direct selling to Richard.   There was worse news brewing. Mr. Cooper says he read aHome Furnishings Daily article in November in which a topRaytheon official heralded major new consolidation moves inthe company's appliance businesses. &quot;Within a week we werenotified that Amana wanted to cancel our distributorship,&quot; hesays. Indeed, Amana wanted to end the relationship on just 10days' notice, according to Cooper. Mr. Cooper says an Amanaofficial told him: &quot;It's not because you're doing a bad job;we just think we can do better.&quot;   By that time, Cooper was on full legal alert. Itdispatched a lawyer to state court in Newark, suing Amana toblock the termination. Amana got the case transferred to thefederal court. There Cooper won the preliminary orderprotecting its business, though it also has to post a$350,000 bond to cover damages that it might have to pay ifAmana wins the case.   Many of Mr. Cooper's customers are squarely in his corner,especially smaller retailers that fear they'd get scantattention from Amana without a go-between. (Mr. Cooperworries that his biggest customers, on the other hand, wouldprefer to negotiate directly with Amana.)   Allen Jacobson, president of Jacobson Distributing Co., anElizabeth, N.J., retailer, says of Amana's termination moveagainst Cooper, &quot;I didn't think Raytheon would be so stupid.&quot;He adds: &quot;It's unfair to Cooper, and it's also bad business.&quot;   Debra Oberg-Kmiecik, treasurer of Oberg andamp; Lindquist Corp.,a Westwood, N.J., retailer, says of the 48-year-old Mr.Cooper's plight: &quot;It's a shame when something like thishappens to a guy who's done a tremendous job all his life. Tous, Amana is Cooper -- it's one and the same.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
