Environmental monitoring including measurementof local doses, local dose rates, and airborne radioactivity in the shafthas been made according to the provisions for radiation protection atthe place of work. Maximum permissible personal doses or activity levelsfor occupationally exposed persons have not been exceeded in the reportingperiod. Exhaust air monitoring detected the nuclides H-3, C-14, Pb-210,and the short-lived daughter products of Rn-222 and Rn-220. The activityconcentrations in the environment, determined from the measured annualrelease values, for some part have been lower than the average of naturalconcentrations of said nuclides. The radiation exposure due to emissions,measured at the least favourable point in the environment, has been farbelow the limits set by the Radiation Protection Ordinance. In conclusion:The radiation exposure of the personnel and of the population in thearea of the Asse shaft plant due to the storage of radioactive is low,compared to the natural radiation exposure.</TEXT></DOC>
