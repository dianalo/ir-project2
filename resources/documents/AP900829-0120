The crash early Wednesday of the huge C-5A transport was thefirst major accident in the nearly 3-week-old, round-the-clockdeployment of U.S. personnel and equipment to the gulf.   ``I don't want to speculate on the cause of this mishap,'' saidBrig. Gen. Richard Swope of the 316th Air Division. ``We don't haveany indication as to what the cause of the accident was.''   Four of the 17 people aboard the cargo plane were injured whenthe massive aircraft tumbled into a field early Wednesday aftertaking off from Ramstein Air Base, a stopover for many U.S.military flights bound for the gulf region.   The plane was bound for Frankfurt carrying medical supplies,food and aircraft maintenance equipment for U.S. troops sent toSaudi Arabia following the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, U.S.Air Force officials said.   Late Wednesday, the Air Force released the names of the victims.No hometowns were listed.   Nine of those killed and one of those injured were reservistswith the 433rd Military Airlift Wing from Kelly Air Force Base inSan Antonio. The four others were stationed at Ramstein or atnearby Hahn Air Base.   Listed as dead from the 433rd were Maj. John M. Gordon, pilot;Maj. Richard W. Chase, pilot; Sgt. Rosendo Herrera, flightengineer; Sgt. Carpio Villarreal, flight engineer; Sgt. Daniel G.Perez, loadmaster; Sgt. Edward E. Sheffield, loadmaster; Maj.Richard M. Price, first pilot; Sgt. Lonty A. Knutson, crew chief;and Sgt. Daniel Garza, crew chief.   Also killed were Capt. Bradley Schuldt and Sgt. Rande Hulec ofRamstein and sergeants Samuel Gardner and Marc Cleyman of Hahn.   Listed as injured were Lt. Col. Frederick Arzt and Sgt. DwightPettit, both of McChord Air Base in Washington state; Capt. CynthiaBorecky of England Air Base, Louisiana, and Sgt. Lorenzo Galvan Jr.of the 433rd.   The four were hospitalized and reported in satisfactorycondition, said Sgt. Rourk Sheehan, spokesman for the LandstuhlArmy hospital nearby.   The 433rd had not been called to active duty, but somereservists with the wing were voluntarily participating inOperation Desert Shield after arranging time off from theircivilian jobs.   The plane was from the 60th Military Airlift Squadron fromTravis Air Force Base in California and was en route to Rhein-MeinAir Base near Frankfurt, authorities said.   It left the Ramstein air base at about 12:30 a.m. and clippedthe tops of trees before crashing and breaking apart.   Twisted chunks of wings, landing gear, fuselage and other debriswere scattered over a wide area. Firefighters were still dousingsmoldering sections of wreckage 12 hours after the crash.   The weather was hazy but visibility was about one mile, saidSwope.   He said the aircraft was just over 20 years old, which he saidis not uncommon for the C-5.   The accident occurred about six miles from Miesau, where U.S.military authorities have been removing a cache of chemical weaponsunder an agreement with the West German government.   The West German Defense Ministry said in a statement Wednesdaythe crash posed no danger to the operation.   Ramstein, the largest U.S. Air Force base in Europe, is 90 mileswest of Frankfurt.   The C-5 is the largest transport plane in the Air Force fleetand costs about $148 million.   It was the first crash of a C-5 in 15 years. On April 4, 1975, aC-5B carrying Vietnamese orphans crashed shortly after takeoff nearSaigon, killing 172 people.   The crash Wednesday occurred a day after the second anniversaryof a collision during an air show at Ramstein which killed 70people.</TEXT></DOC>
