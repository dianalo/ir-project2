After meeting with anti-apartheid activist Albertina Sisulu, Bushissued a statement praising her, saying she ``personifies thestruggle for human rights and human dignity and her presence here isan inspiration to us all.''   ``We believe strongly that apartheid is wrong and that it mustend,'' Bush said. He said the administration would work withCongress to obtain funding for education, housing and communityprograms for South Africa's blacks.   ``Such programs should not be misunderstood as our acquiescing inapartheid, but rather viewed as a determined effort to bring it toan end,'' Bush's statement said.   The president's statement did not refer to Mrs. Sisulu's call forthe United States to impose comprehensive economic sanctions againstSouth Africa.   Mrs. Sisulu, whose family has come to symbolize the struggleagainst South Africa's racial segregation policies, said Bush toldher he was outraged by the apartheid system practiced by 5 millionwhites who rule 23 million blacks.   ``He hopes the (U.S.) administration will be a catalyst forbringing about change'' in South Africa, she told reporters afterthe 20-minute White House meeting.   Bush, at whose invitation Mrs. Sisulu came to the United States,met with her shortly before attending a ceremony to commemorate the25th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.   Mrs. Sisulu, the first South African actvist invited by a U.S.president to Washington, said she had asked Bush to impose``comprehensive, mandatory sanctions'' to force the government tonegotiate with the black majority.   ``He said he had difficulty, but he will see what to do with''the question of tougher sanctions than those already imposed by theUnited States in 1986, she said. Asked whether Bush had ruled outadditional U.S. measures, she said ``No, he didn't.''   Former President Reagan was forced to impose limited economicsanctions against South Africa after the Democratic-controlledCongress overrode his veto.   Liberal Democrats have been pushing this year for toughersanctions after failing to gain passage of such a measure last year.   The White House has said it opposes any congressionalrestrictions against South Africa which would limit theadministration's hands in dealing with the government there.   But Bush has been more active than his predecessor in broadeningcontacts with both sides in order to advance negotiations betweenblacks and whites.   In addition to Mrs. Sisulu, he has met with other leadinganti-apartheid activists. F.W. de Klerk, who is expected to becomeSouth Africa's president later this year, has been invited to visitand will become the first South African leader to have officialtalks in Washington in 30 years.   Assistant Secretary of State Herman Cohen will be in South Africanext week.   Mrs. Sisulu's husband, Walter Sisulu, has been serving a lifeterm since 1964, when he was arrested along with Nelson Mandela andother founders of the guerrilla arm of the outlawed African NationalCongress.   Two of her five children have fled South Africa and she has beenunder house arrest and other restrictions for some 18 years.</TEXT></DOC>
