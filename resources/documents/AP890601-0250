Rep. Newt Gingrich, the Georgia Republican who was elected GOPwhip in large part because of his attacks on Wright, said heinitially refused to comment after Wright's resignation speechWednesday because ``I was so angry at the tone of the speech andsome of the things he said.''   ``I thought the whole thing was designed to blame theinstitution and to blame the press,'' Gingrich said of Wright'sspeech.   Gingrich said there is no ``feeding frenzy'' on ethics in theHouse, as Wright alleged. Instead, he said, there is only an effortto ensure that House standards are upheld.   ``Why is it wrong to insist that the current rules be enforcedagainst gross violations?'' he said. ``Not against nitpicking, orclerical error.''   He said Wright and Majority Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif., whoannounced Friday he was resigning rather than face an ethics probeof his personal finances, are ``the first two guys I know of tohave resigned from high office for corruption in modern times.''   House Democrats filed an ethics complaint against Gingrich inApril, alleging that he violated House rules when a group ofwealthy political supporters formed a partnership in 1984 topromote his book, ``Window of Opportunity.''   That complaint is still pending before the committee, andGingrich acknowledged Thursday that he might be the next target ofa House ethics investigation.   ``I'm counting on the same ethics committee,'' he said. ``Itrust their judgment to be honest. They'll have a good measurement_ they can take my book case, and they can compare it to JimWright's book case.   ``They're totally different ... Where Jim Wright was the exampleof how to do it wrong, I think we're the example of how to do itright,'' he said.   Part of the ethics committee's case against Wright involvedallegations that he used bulk sales of his book, ``Reflections of aPublic Man,'' to evade the House limit on outside income.   Gingrich said he does not believe the investigation of Wrightand the allegations of ethical wrongdoing by other members hasdistracted the House from its real business.   ``If you have a speaker with enough violations that he has toresign, I think that's important,'' he said. ``...Isn't having anhonest House part of the real business of the House?''   Asked if Republicans are planning to take advantage ofDemocratic ethics problems for political ends, Gingrich said bothparties should be ``aggressive in looking for instances of badbehavior and police each other.''</TEXT></DOC>
