I deeplyapologize for causing distrust in politics.''   But Nakasone acknowledged publicly for the first time that since1982 he received a total of $322,000 in political donations fromRecruit Co., an information and publishing conglomerate.   People nationwide turned on their television sets for Nakasone'stestimony, which was broadcast live.   Officials of the governing Liberal Democratic Party said thethree hours of questioning proved Nakasone's innocence in thefinancial scandal, which occurred during his 1982-87 administration.   But opposition leaders said he dodged crucial questions. Theydemanded he testify a second time before Parliament's upper house.   Meanwhile, members of the governing party's Executive Councilwere to meet Friday in their continuing search for a successor toPrime Minister Noboru Takeshita.   The Liberal Democrats have been unable to replace Takeshita, whoannounced last month he would resign in face of widespread distrustin the party and government after the Recruit scandal. Most seniorparty officials have admitted receiving money or stock from thecompany.   Nakasone said contributions he received from Recruit werereported to the government as stipulated by law, but suggested thatsome donations may have been divided among several support groupsto remain below the minimum reporting amount.   Nakasone, 70, is the first politician called to testify underoath in Parliament in the scandal. He had refused earlieropposition demands to testify, leading to a three-month oppositionboycott of debate on the fiscal 1989 budget.   ``I refused to testify earlier because I have never doneanything wrong,'' Nakasone said Thursday.   After the session, a visibly relieved Nakasone told reporters:``Facts are facts. They always prevail.''   But opposition leaders said they doubted his testimony.   ``I regret his testimony was filled with lies,'' said TsuruoYamaguchi, secretary-general of the Japan Socialist Party, thelargest opposition group. ``It amounted to a defense of his seat inParliament.''   In the scandal, Recruit sold highly discounted, unlisted stockto about 160 influential people, including 17 politicians or theiraides. Many recipients sold the stock after it was publicly listedand rose quickly in value, reaping large profits.   Eleven of the politicians were members of Nakasone's Cabinet,and opposition parties have charged that he was at the center ofthe scandal.   Nakasone has acknowledged that three aides bought a total of29,000 Recruit shares, the largest amount of any politician. Hetestified Thursday that they made a profit of about $450,000 andused the money for entertaining political associates.   In his testimony, Nakasone also denied any involvement in theresale of two U.S.-made Cray supercomputers to Recruit by Japan'ssemi-private telecommunications giant, Nippon Telegraph andTelephone.   Former company chairman Hisashi Shinto is among 16 bureaucrats,businessmen and politicians arrested or charged in the scandal.Prosecutors have said he assigned preferential treatment to Recruitin return for stock.   Prosecutors on Monday lodged bribery charges against twopoliticians _ Nakasone's chief Cabinet secretary and the formersecretary general of the opposition Komeito.   The scandal has caused the resignation of three Cabinet membersin addition to Prime Minister Takeshita and led to a sharp drop inpublic support for the Liberal Democrats.</TEXT></DOC>
