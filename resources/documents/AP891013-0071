Lebanese police said they had no information on the case. ``Theabduction was not reported to us in the first place,'' a spokesmansaid.   Reliable Lebanese security sources said the woman, AstridFischer, was released in the port city of Tripoli.   One source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Ms. Fischerleft Tripoli after her release and went to the village of Koubba.The part-time attendant for Swissair has a house in this village inthe Syrian-controlled north.   The security source said gunmen kidnapped Ms. Fischer in KoubbaSunday and that she was ``interrogated in connection with heractivities and stay in Lebanon.'' He did not elaborate and refusedto identify the kidnappers.   Reporters and photographers arriving in Koubba, 31 miles northof Beirut, were told by unidentified armed guards ringing Ms.Fischer's house that she did not want to be disturbed.   The guards, who wore civilian clothes, declined to identifythemselves. They were believed to be either members of the Syrianintelligence service or militiamen of former Lebanese presidentSuleiman Franjieh _ the only paramilitary force allowed to operatein the region.   Franjieh, 79, president when Lebanon's civil war broke out in1975, heads the Marada, or Giants militia, which is allied withSyria.   Christian and Moslem radio stations in Beirut said Franjieh wasinstrumental in Ms. Fischer's release. They did not elaborate.   In Bern, Swiss Foreign Ministry official Francois Chappuis saidMs. Fischer's freedom was gained through contacts by Dino Sciolli,Switzerland's ambassador to Lebanon based in Cyprus.   Chappuis told reporters there never was any indication of apolitical motive behind Fischer's abduction and no demands weremade. He refused to speculate on the motive.   Ms. Fischer was the third Swiss national to be abducted inLebanon in the last week.   Red Cross workers Elio Erriquez and Emmanual Christen, bothSwiss, were abducted in the southern provincial capital of SidonOct. 6. No group has claimed responsibility or made demands fortheir release.   Including the Swiss Red Cross workers, 18 foreigners are missingin Lebanon. They include eight Americans, four Britons, two WestGermans, an Italian and an Irishman.   Most of the foreign hostages are believed held by pro-IranianShiite Moslem underground factions.   Held longest is American Terry Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,1985.   Police blamed the radical Palestinian Fatah-RevolutionaryCouncil faction led by terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal forkidnapping Christen and Erriquez. The group denied involvement.</TEXT></DOC>
