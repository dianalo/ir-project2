It was at Nio in Kagawa Pref. It was run forinvestigation from September, 1981 to March, 1984. Two plants were installed:one was based on curvature collection and the other was based on towercollection. Either was studied while being run. The major point in operatinga solar thermal power plant is reduction of heat radiation loss. In thissense, the operation of the heat storage is important. The capacity ofthe heat storage has proved to be at least the value corresponding toa generator power of 1000 kW-hour. This paper evaluates the performanceof both the curvature-collection and tower-collection based plants. Theevaluation items include the quantity of incident solar radiation, thequantity of generated steam, the generated power, and the relationshipamong them. Evaluation was made using equations obtained through statisticalinvestigation. The percentages of the power generation time, the heatstoring time, plant halt time during the day, and the plant halt timeat night on a day are also evaluated. In addition, the heat radiationloss is evaluated.</TEXT></DOC>
