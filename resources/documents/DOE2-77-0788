<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-77-0788 </DOCNO><TEXT>The present single-frame and multiframe gated X-ray images, whose time-resolutionis as fast as 150 psec, are based on the gating of microchannel platesin a stripline configuration; their gating voltage is derived from theavalanche breakdown of reverse-biased p-n junctions, thereby generatinghigh-power voltage pulses as short as 70 psec. For use on the LawrenceLivermore National Laboratory's Nova apparatus, the microchannel platesare gated at different times and detect four gated images from an arrayof four pinholes. Representative results from direct-drive implosionsare presented. 8 references.</TEXT></DOC>
