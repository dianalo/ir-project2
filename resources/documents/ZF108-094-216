(HP) this week will fire a salvo of new plotters equippedwith a souped-up version of the firm's plotter language, company officialssaid.andM;The firm will launch three additions to its high-end HP 7600 electrostaticplotter line, as well as three new pen plotters in its DraftMaster series,according to Naomi Overton, a spokeswoman for HP, in Palo Alto, Calif.andM;All six plotters sport a new version of HP's Graphics Language, calledHPGL-2, which processes documents four to five times faster than the originalHPGL, Overton said.andP;  HP used a new technique in HPGL-2, called polylineencoding, that compresses data so it flows more quickly to the plotter, shesaid.andM;Although polyline encoding speeds data throughput, it does not affect theplotters' individual output speeds.andP;  Even so, users were impressed.andM;&quot;Any boost in plotter speed is always a welcome sight to CAD users,&quot; saidDave Edwards, president of CAD Consulting Services in Montgomery, Ala.andM;Hewlett-Packard also enhanced the language so that software developers needonly write one driver to support all HPGL-2 plotters.andP;  Previously, developershad to write a different driver for each HPGL plotter, Overton said.andM;Hewlett-Packard plans eventually to replace its HPGL plotters with modelsthat support HPGL-2, Overton said.andP;  The new language is backward compatiblewith software written for HPGL, she said.andM;To bolster current support, HP will announce that third-party CAD vendorsincluding CADKey and VersaCAD Inc. will develop HPGL-2 drivers for softwarecompatibility.andM;The new HP 7600 Model 355 plotter provides color electrostatic plotting on36-inch media.andP;  This high-end model costs $45,900, officials said.andM;A new monochrome model in the HP 7600 series, the Model 250, provides 24-inchoutput and is priced at $25,900.andM;Another monochrome plotter, the Model 255, prints on 36-inch media and ispriced at $29,900.andM;Hewlett-Packard's new pen plotters include the $8,495 sheet-feedingDraftmaster SX and the $9,995 Draftmaster RX, which prints on roll-fed paper.andO;The new Draftmaster MX, a roll-feed pen plotter, is priced at $11,995 andincludes a 20M-byte hard-disk drive and four I/O ports.andM;For smaller images, HP next week will also introduce an HPGL-2 emulationcartridge that lets the HP PaintJet XL color ink-jet printer output HPGL-2files, the officials said.andP;  The cartridge is priced at $995.andM;All of the products will be available upon introduction.andM;Hewlett-Packard can be reached at (800) 752-0900.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
