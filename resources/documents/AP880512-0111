The first spike in the prime rate since the October stock marketcrash was announced Wednesday by major banks. The rise from 8.5percent to 9 percent heralded a period of more expensive loans forpurchases ranging from plant machinery to homes and cars.   The prime rate reflects the banks' costs of borrowing money andtrails more subtle increases in other interest rates. But the rateis watched closely because bankers use it as a basis forcalculating loans to businesses and for determining many types offixed and adjustable-rate consumer loans, including popularhome-equity loans.   Stock traders reacted badly to the rate rise, partly because itrenewed memories of the higher interest rates that preceded thestock market crash. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 37.80points to a three-month low of 1,965.85.   The widely watched index partly recovered by late this morning,up nearly 10 points to the 1,976 level. In the bond market, asensitive barometer of interest rates, prices were little changed.   Many economists said they didn't believe interest rates wouldrise much further, largely because the economy could stumble badlyif borrowing costs increased substantially.   These economists argue that Federal Reserve Chairman AlanGreenspan, a Reagan administration appointee who has wide power toinfluence interest rates, doesn't want to make any sudden move totighten credit, especially in an election year.   But the Fed also wants to heed inflationary warning signs thathave appeared, notably a 14-year low in the unemployment ratereported last week by the Labor Department.   ``It wants to tap the brakes a little bit rather than slam themon in a great fury,'' said Robert Brusca, chief economist for NikkoSecurities International Inc. in New York.   John Wilson, chief economist at Bank of America in SanFrancisco, said ``clearly, we're on an upward move in interestrates and they'll continue to move upward. But I think they'llflatten out.''   David Blitzer, chief economist for Standard andamp; Poor's Corp., theinvestment research and credit-rating concern, said he believed theprime rate would stay at 9 percent, perhaps moving to 9.5 percentby June.   But Blitzer said he didn't believe the Fed would move to nudgerates much higher than they are now.   ``I think this year, the Fed wants to keep the economygrowing,'' he said. The Fed injected billions of dollars inreserves into the banking system after the October crash toforestall a possible recession. But in recent months, evidence ofsurprisingly strong economic growth has shifted concern to risinginflation.   This concern has been most evident in the bond market, whereinterest rates have been rising in anticipation that the Fed wouldtighten its credit policies. Economists say it's clear the Fed hasmoved recently to nudge interest rates higher by controlling theamount of money in the banking system.   Sandra Shaber, an economist at the Futures Group, aWashington-based forecasting firm, said the prime rate increasewould have a broader impact on consumers now than in years pastbecause it no longer is simply a benchmark for loans to bankcorporate customers.   ``Once upon a time, the impact would have been limited,'' shesaid. ``But now, because of the increased use of home-equity loansand other adjustable rates, even people who have current debtoutstanding, they feel the effects. Their financing costs rise. Itsqueezes their discretionary spending in general.''</TEXT></DOC>
