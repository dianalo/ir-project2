The Secretary is further authorized to imposesanctions for the violation of a protective order. <T3>Id. </T3>Current antidumping duty and countervailing duty regulationsprovide that a person against whom sanctions are proposed ``shall be affordeda reasonable opportunity to be heard before the determination is made.''19 CFR 353.30(e)(3), 355.20(e)(2).On July 6, 1987, the Department proposed rules to govern the impositionof sanctions for violation of an administrative protective order (52 FR25246). The Department considered all of the comments received in responseto the proposed rule and request for comments. These comments, and theDepartment's response to them, are summarized below.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>These regulations are effective December 28, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Stephen J. Powell, Chief Counselfor Import Administration, (202) 377-1411.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Classification</ITAG><T3>Executive Order 12291. </T3>The ITA has determined that these proceduresfor imposing sanctions for violations of an antidumping duty or countervailingduty administrative protective order in 19 Code of Federal Regulations(``CFR'') Parts 353, 354, and 355 are not a major rule as defined in section1(b) of Executive Order 12291 (46 FR 13193, February 19, 1981) becausethey will not: (1) Have a major monetary effect on the economy; (2) resultin a major increase in costs or prices; or (3) have a significant adverseeffect on competition (domestic or foreign), employment, investment, productivity,or innovation.<T3>Executive Order 12612. </T3>These regulations do not contain policieswith Federalism implications sufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalismassessment under Executive Order 12612 (52 FR 41685, October 30, 1987).<T3>Paperwork Reduction Act. </T3>These regulations will not impose a collectionof information requirement for purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Actof 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>).<T3>Regulatory Flexibility Act. </T3>The General Counsel of the Departmentof Commerce has certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the SmallBusiness Administration that this rule will not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small business entities because, to theextent it changes existing practices, the rule simply improves the administrationof the antidumping duty and countervailing duty provisions of the TariffAct of 1930, as amended. As a result, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysiswas not prepared.<T3>Changes Required by Departmental Reorganization. </T3>In the proposedrule, the Assistant Secretary for Trade Administration was made responsiblefor deciding whether to initiate proceedings and for taking other actionsfollowing a report of investigation. As we explained in the preamble, ``Personswho make day-to-day decisions under the antidumping and countervailingduty laws * * * would not be involved.''On October 1, 1987, the position of Assistant Secretary for Trade Administrationwas abolished. Consistent with the view expressed in the preamble to theproposed rule, the authority to make decisions during the initial stagesof a proceeding under these regulations has been delegated to the DeputyUnder Secretary for International Trade. This rule has been revised accordingly.<ITAG tagnum="85">Time Limits Imposed on the Investigation and Initiation of ChargingProceeding</ITAG><T3>Comment:</T3> Three parties suggest that the Department impose a timelimit under andSection;354.5 with respect to allegations that the terms ofan administrative protective order have been violated. A reasonable andadequate time frame would maintain the integrity of the protective orderprocess, ensure adequate protection for business proprietary information,and protect the rights of the accused party. Requiring prompt notificationof an apparent disclosure of protective order material would allow someremedial measures to be taken in order to minimize actual harm to the partywhose information allegedly has been wrongfully disclosed.One party believes that an allegation of impermissible behavior shouldnot be permitted more than three months after the action takes place, unlessthe violation could not have been discovered through the exercise of reasonablecare. A second party believes that a one-year limitation should be imposedboth on the investigation concerning the alleged violation and on the possibleinitiation of a proceeding under andSection;354.6.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> We agree that time limits are appropriateand have revised the proposed regulations as follows: First, we modifiedandSection;354.5(b) to provide that the Department will not investigate anallegation unless it is received within 30 days after the violation hasoccurred or could have been discovered through the exercise of reasonableand ordinary care. If necessary, the Director will make a determinationwhether this condition is met before deciding whether to commence an investigation.In addition to the reasons given in the comments, our experience has beenthat stale allegations not only make impossible the taking of prompt remedialaction, if appropriate, but also seriously hamper an investigation becauseof the fading memories and unavailability of witnesses. No investigationthe Department has to date conducted would have been precluded by applicationof this 30-day reporting requirement.We also modified andSection;354.5(b) to state that the Director will conductan investigation and submit a report no later than 180 days after receivinginformation concerning a violation. Upon the Director's request, and ifextraordinary circumstances exist, the Deputy Under Secretary for InternationalTrade may grant the Director up to an additional 180 days to conduct theinvestigation and submit the report.Finally, we changed andSection;354.6 to provide that the Deputy Under Secretarymust decide whether to initiate a proceeding no later than 60 days afterreceiving a report of the investigation.The regulations as originally proposed set forth time limits for the remainderof the sanction procedures, except for the scheduling of a hearing by apresiding official. Under andSection;354.12, the presiding official willschedule a hearing at a reasonable time, date, and place. We have not revisedthe proposal in this respect. This statement thus grants the presidingofficer sufficient discretion to take account both of the presiding officer'sother obligations and of discussions that may be taking place between theparties to narrow the issues. For its part, however, the Department wouldnot intend to continue such discussions for more than 90 days after issuanceof the charging letter.<ITAG tagnum="84">Guidelines for Treatment of Protective Order Material</ITAG><T3>Comment:</T3> Two parties suggest that guidelines defining appropriateor inappropriate behavior in treatment of protective order material beincorporated into these rules. Failure to establish guidelines will resultin serious differences of opinion as to what constitutes a violation andneedless allegations against attorneys trying to comply with the termsof an administrative protective order as they understand them.One party suggests the following guidelines be included in these proceduresas new paragraph (d) to andSection;354.5:<ITAG tagnum="21">(d) In making his investigation and preparing his report, the Directorshall be guided as follows:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Following is a non-exhaustive list of behaviors that constituteviolations of a protective order:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) The wilful disclosure of protective order information to any clientor any other third party not allowed access under the protective order;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) Counsel's taking protective order material out of the United Statesto a foreign country;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(c) The use of protective order information in questioning third partieseven when those parties would not be in the position to pass any informationto an interested party to the proceeding;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(d) Intentional disposal of APO documents not returned to the agencyother than through shredding or tearing (in at least 8 parts).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Following is a non-exhaustive list of behavior that does not constituteactionable violations of a protective order:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) Inadvertent disclosure of protected information, including inadvertentfailure to shred or tear documents not returned to the agency; however,if the Director finds that the individual or firm that has made the inadvertentdisclosure has made similar disclosures in the recent past (preceding 12months), he shall indicate this history in his investigation report;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) Collection of documents from counsel prior to their further disseminationwill not be deemed to be a ``disclosure'' at all; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(c) In the instance where administrative reviews of the same orderfor different time periods are proceeding simultaneously, the use of protectiveorder material received as the result of one review in the other;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(d) The disclosure of such issues (claim for an adjustment for after-salerebates, sales below cost of production, etc.) when such issues are notevident from public information but only from the APO information;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(e) The disclosure of ranges of aggregate values within plus or minus10 percent of the actual values or of sample calculations when the actualvalues appear only in protective order information.</ITAG>Another party supports a distinction between willful and inadvertent disclosuresof proprietary information. The party recommends that when the failureto delete proprietary information from the public version of a brief orother correspondence is found to be inadvertent, the person submittingthe information should be required to demonstrate that the release causedsubstantial harm to its competitive position. If it is determined thatno, or minimal, harm has resulted from the disclosure, the party believesthe Department can reasonably conclude that the proprietary designationwas improperly granted and that no violation of the protective order occurred.A person should not be penalized for the inadvertent disclosure of informationwhere that disclosure did not cause substantial harm to the competitiveposition of the submitter.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> The Department agrees that guidelines defininginappropriate behavior in the treatment of protective order material shouldbe incorporated into the procedures for imposing sanctions. Thus, we haveadded guidelines under andSection;354.5, new paragraph (d), to assist personssubject to an administrative protective order. The guidelines are basedupon the violations described in our September 11, 1987, notice of theStatus of Investigations into Charges of Violations of Administrative ProtectiveOrders in Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Proceedings (52 FR 34399),the comments we received with respect to that notice (which are summarizedand answered here), and the comments we received with respect to theseproposed regulations.The Department chose not to define guidelines for permissible behaviorunder a protective order. We believe that persons subject to an administrativeprotective order may place themselves in greater danger of committing aviolation by attempting to interpret guidelines of permissible behaviorrather than by attempting to avoid impermissible behavior. We urge personssubject to protective orders to contact the Department attorney assignedto the case if they are unable to determine from the guidelines, or fromthe terms of the protective order, whether a contemplated act constitutesa violation. (See, ``Designation of APO Legal Officer,'' <T3>infra.</T3>)The Department also did not include as a violation the suggested exampleof ``[c]ounsel's taking protective order material out of the United Statesto a foreign country.'' We fail to see how the risk of disclosure is increasedby counsel's removal of proprietary material from the United States suchthat the simple act of doing so should be proclaimed, <T3>ipso facto,</T3> a violation. Counsel is subject to the requirementsto safeguard proprietary information at any location, and if the risk ofdisclosure increases from one place to the next, counsel is expected toincrease the steps taken to safeguard this material.In addition, the Department did not include a guideline on the method bywhich the disposal of protective order material must take place. As explainedin response to the next comment, this suggestion is directed more to proceduresfor administering protective orders than to sanctions for violations ofthose orders.We disagree with the suggestion that we should authorize limited use ofproprietary material obtained during one administrative review of an orderin a later administrative review of the same order. (See, ``Use of ProtectiveOrder Material in Other Proceedings,'' <T3>infra.</T3>) While isolated examples can be given of the potentialutility of such exceptions, the increased risk of disclosure and the drainof the Department's limited resources away from the real work of a reviewfar outweigh that potential benefit. In order to implement the comment,protective orders would have to extend in time from the initial investigationthrough all administrative reviews, which means keeping such orders activefor ten years or more in some cases. The chance that proprietary materialcan adequately be managed under those circumstances is slim, and the risk,therefore, of inadvertent disclosure is greatly increased.Moreover, parties could find it necessary to raise again issues resolvedas to the particular facts in prior reviews, thus ensuring that no topicis ever put to rest and distracting Departmental personnel from resolvingthe issues that pertain to the facts in the current review. These dangersare not warranted by the potential benefits identified in the comment.The Department, of course, will have access to proprietary data in priorreviews as part of its investigatory mandate, and will transfer proprietaryinformation into the record of the current review from that of a priorreview when it is appropriate to do so.The recommendation that use of proprietary information when questioningthird parties should be considered a violation is included in the firstguideline, that is, such use would be considered disclosure of protectiveorder information to someone not listed in the guideline. Finally, the Department did not distinguish in its guidelines between willfuland inadvertent disclosures of protected information for purposes of decidingwhether a violation has, in fact, occurred. Disclosure of proprietary information,inadvertent or otherwise, will continue to constitute a violation of theadministrative protective order. We recognize, however, that a willfulor inadvertent violation of an administrative protective order and thedegree of harm caused by a violation should be considered in determiningwhether sanctions are appropriate and, if so, what sanctions to impose.This is why the test for deciding whether to initiate a charging proceedinghas two parts. Before a charging letter is issued, the Deputy Under Secretarymust find under andSection; 354.6 not only that reasonable cause to believea person violated a protective order exists, but also that imposition ofa sanction for that violation is appropriate. If a sanction is not appropriatefor the violation, the Deputy Under Secretary will not initiate a proceeding.If a sanction is appropriate, the gradient of sanctions listed in andSection;354.3 provides the Deputy Under Secretary, the presiding official, or theAPO Sanctions Board sufficient discretion to impose the sanction appropriateto the particular violation. As noted in andSection; 354.6, ``In determiningwhether sanctions are appropriate and, if so, what sanctions to impose,the Deputy Under Secretary will consider the nature of the violation, theresulting harm, and other relevant circumstances of the case.'' A similarstatement is made in andSection; 354.14(b). <ITAG tagnum="85">Handling of Protective Order Material Following a Final Determination</ITAG><T3>Comment:</T3> One party suggests that the Department establish a guidelineas to what documents containing proprietary information must be returnedto the Department or the submitting party and what documents may be destroyed.The party believes that the current policy requires only that the originaldocuments furnished must be returned, while copies of the original documentsand all notes, memoranda, and official submissions containing protectedinformation may be destroyed. If the Department permits destruction ofsuch information, it should clearly indicate how that destruction shouldtake place, specifically as regards an electronic memory or a computerprogram. <T3>Department's Position:</T3> The subject matter of this comment is directedmore to procedures for administering protective orders than to sanctionsfor violations of those orders, which is the subject of this rulemaking.We have, however, deleted ``destruction'' of proprietary information fromthe guideline in new paragraph (d), even though it was included in theproposed rule, because the Department permits destruction, and certificationof such destruction, in accordance with instructions contained in the modelapplication and protective order. <ITAG tagnum="85">Use of Protective Order Material When a Petition Is Refiled </ITAG><T3>Comment:</T3> One party recommends that the Department should presumethat protective order material has not been misused when an antidumpingduty or a countervailing duty case is refiled, provided that the petitionercan demonstrate an independent basis for believing circumstances changedsufficiently to warrant the refiling. Counsel risks a claim that he usedprotective order information submitted in a prior proceeding when refilinga petition following the termination of the earlier proceeding. A guidelineon this subject would significantly reduce any chilling effect upon theparty's right to petition the government for redress. <T3>Department's Position:</T3> The Department agrees with the presumptionenunciated by the party; that is, the Department presumes that protectiveorder material has not been misused when an antidumping duty or a countervailingduty petition is refiled. We did not, however, include this presumptionas a guideline under these regulations because we decided, in responseto an earlier comment, not to establish guidelines for permissible behaviorunder a protective order. Again, the Department is always willing to consultwith any person who requests guidance as to the use of proprietary information.<ITAG tagnum="84">Standard for Allegations </ITAG><T3>Comment:</T3> One party suggests that counsel who allege a violationof an administrative protective order be held to the same standard as thatimposed under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. This standardwould limit frivolous allegations of wrongdoing by other counsel. <T3>Department's Position:</T3> The Department condemns frivolous allegationsof wrongdoing under these regulations, but does not consider it necessaryat this time to impose a standard by which to judge the propriety of anindividual's allegation. Civil remedies allow an accused party an adequateresponse to the more serious charges of frivolity. Our experience alsodemonstrates that the persons who allege a violation impose upon themselvesa rigorous standard by which they scrutinize their decision. If these regulationsgenerate frivolous allegations, we will consider imposing a standard forallegations of violations of administrative protective orders in futurerulemaking, together with appropriate sanctions for failure to meet thatstandard. <ITAG tagnum="85">Repeated Inadvertent Disclosures of Protective Order Material</ITAG><T3>Comment:</T3> One party recommends that the text of andSection; 354.6include the following statement:<ITAG tagnum="21">If the Director has found a repeated history of inadvertent disclosures,the Assistant Secretary will notify appropriate ITA [Department] personneland request that they provide assistance to the offending party in theform of review of the party's APO procedures and the provision of appropriateadvice so that the party may reduce or eliminate his or her inadvertentdisclosures. Failure to adopt the recommendations of the Commerce Departmentpersonnel, where such recommendations are reasonable and do not involvesubstantial additional costs, can be considered by the agency in determiningwhether future APO release should be permitted.</ITAG><T3>Department's Position:</T3> The Department does not consider it necessaryto add the party's recommended paragraph to our regulations. We have alwaysplaced a high priority on educating parties as to the proper use and controlof proprietary information and will continue to provide guidance whenevera misunderstanding develops. Also, the failure of a person to adopt theDepartment's recommendations is, more appropriately, a consideration ofintent to violate a protective order and thus will be reflected in theDeputy Under Secretary's recommendation for sanction. We note that anydisclosure, albeit inadvertent, constitutes a violation and the Departmentmay investigate and take action accordingly.<ITAG tagnum="84">Designation of an APO Legal Officer</ITAG><T3>Comment:</T3> One party suggests that the Department designate an ``APOlegal officer.'' This individual would have the power under the regulationsto issue formal advisory opinions as to the confidentiality of informationderived from protective order materials. The difficult decisions as tomaintenance of a document's confidentiality during an indirect discussionof protective order data, or whether a document's confidentiality has beenwaived by the submitter, should not be left solely to the judgment of opposingcounsel.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> The Department does not consider it necessaryto designate a particular legal officer to answer questions concerningprotective order material. A person may contact the attorney assigned fromthe Office of Chief Counsel for Import Administration to seek clarificationas to whether a proposed act constitutes a violation of an administrativeprotective order. We will continue, however, to evaluate whether it isnecessary to appoint an APO legal officer.<ITAG tagnum="84">Closing Public Hearings</ITAG><T3>Comment: </T3>Two parties recommend that the Department close the administrativehearings in antidumping and countervailing duty proceedings when necessaryto permit disclosure of proprietary information. One of these parties suggeststhat a portion of the hearing be closed only where all parties to the investigationconsent. The other party suggests that the Department withhold copies ofthe transcript from the public for 48 hours to permit counsel to deleteproprietary information from it. The spontaneous nature of testimony ata hearing increases the risk of an inadvertent disclosure of proprietaryinformation. Closed hearings would reduce this risk.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>The subject matter of this comment is moreappropriate for consideration in the context of our current revision ofthe regulations for countervailing duty and antidumping duty proceedingsthan in the context of this rulemaking. Therefore, this comment will beconsidered in our revision of those regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Blanket Administrative Protective Orders</ITAG><T3>Comment: </T3>One party suggests that all counsel to a proceeding becovered by a single, blanket administrative protective order. This approachwould limit the concern of respondents' counsel where multiple source informationis used and reduce the risk of inadvertent disclosure when attempting tomake many versions of the same brief.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>The subject matter of this comment is moreappropriate for consideration in the context of our current revision ofthe regulations for countervailing duty and antidumping duty proceedingsthan in the context of this rulemaking. Therefore, this comment will beconsidered in our revision of those regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Use of Protective Order Material in Other Proceedings</ITAG><T3>Comment: </T3>One party believes that the Department should not artificiallylimit its own factfinding abilities by preventing interested parties anditself from taking cognizance of protective order information in the contextof any ongoing proceeding in which the information is relevant. The statutorylimitation on the use of protective order information is designed to encouragesubmission of such information by giving assurances that the data willnot be used in additional legal proceedings brought by parties given access.This limitation should not bar the use of this material over the courseof a single proceeding as that term is defined in the Department's regulations.This limitation should also not bar the use of this material against anotherparty where that party is involved in the same or a separate investigationof the same product. Finally, this limitation should not bar use of thisinformation in a simultaneous investigation of the same party under anotherunfair trade statute.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>The Department has consistently held thatthe acts described above violate administrative protective orders. Therefore,to clarify our holding, we established under andSection;354.5, new paragraph(d), guidelines to address the use of protective order information forpurposes other than the proceeding for which it was obtained. (See, ``Guidelinesfor Treatment of Protective Order Material,'' <T3>supra. </T3>See also the Department's discussion of this issue in thecurrent revision of the regulations for antidumping and countervailingduty proceedings.)<ITAG tagnum="84">Limit Sanctions to Appearances Before the ITA</ITAG><T3>Comment: </T3>One party suggests that the sanctions barring a personfrom appearing before the Department or any constituent agency or othersub-unit of the Department under paragraphs (a)(1) and (b)(1) of andSection;354.3and paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of andSection;354.8 be limited just to appearancesbefore the ITA. The party believes that a person found to have violateda protective order before the ITA should not be barred from appearing beforeother agencies of the Department, such as the Patent and Trademark Officeor the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which perform servicesdifferent from those of the ITA.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>The Department agrees that sanctions tobar a person from appearing before the Department should be limited justto appearances before the ITA. That is, our proceedings do not considerfactors relevant to the appearance of a person before another agency ofthe Department. Thus, a violation of an administrative protective orderforms no basis for us to decide whether a person should be prohibited frompracticing before another agency. Sections 354.3(a), 354.3(b), and 354.8(c) have been amended to be consistentwith this position. The Department notes, however, that it still retainsthe authority under andSection;354.15(e) to provide such information to theethics panel or other disciplinary body of the appropriate bar associationsor other professional associations whenever the Deputy Under Secretarysubjects a charge or affected party to a sanction under andSection;354.3(a)(1)and to any Federal agency likely to have an interest in the matter andwill cooperate in any disciplinary actions by any association or agency.We would also note that disbarment from practice before ITA could triggerdisciplinary proceedings by other agencies.<ITAG tagnum="84">No Time Limit Imposed on Sanctions</ITAG><T3>Comment: </T3>One party recommends that the seven-year limit placedon sanctions barring a person from appearing before the Department underandSection;354.3(a)(1) and andSection;354.3(b)(1) or denying a person accessto proprietary information under andSection;354.3(a)(2) be lifted. The Departmentshould have the ability to impose sanctions upon a person found to haveviolated a protective order for a period longer than seven years.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>The Department agrees that it should notlimit its ability to impose sanctions upon a person found to have violateda protective order for a period not to exceed seven years. Paragraphs (a)(1),(a)(2), and (b)(1) of andSection;354.3 have thus been amended to be consistentwith this position.<ITAG tagnum="85">Longer Time Limit for the Presiding Official's Initial Decision</ITAG><T3>Comment: </T3>One party suggests that the presiding official be allowedmore than 10 days to file an initial decision after the conclusion of ahearing under andSection;354.14(a). The party notes that it normally takesmore than one day for a hearing transcript to become available and thatto require a transcript in one day significantly increases the costs ofthe proceeding.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>The Department agrees that it should increasethe period in which the presiding official will ordinarily issue a decisionfollowing the conclusion of a hearing. Paragraph (a) of andSection;354.14has thus been amended to allow the presiding official 20 days to file adecision under these circumstances.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note._</T4>The Department added the phrase, ``whenever the Deputy UnderSecretary subjects a charged or affected party to a sanction under paragraph(a)(1) of andSection;354.3,'' to the last sentence of andSection;354.15(e)in order to indicate when the Department will refer a violation under thispart to the disciplinary body of the appropriate professional association.The last sentence of andSection;354.14(e) now reads as follows:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Deputy Under Secretary will also provide such information to theethics panel or other disciplinary body of the appropriate bar associationsor other professional associations <T3>whenever the Deputy Under Secretary subjects a charged or affectedparty to a sanction under paragraph (a)(1) of andSection;354.3 </T3>and toany Federal agency likely to have an interest in the matter and will cooperatein any disciplinary actions by <T3>any </T3>[the] association[s] or agenc<T3>y</T3>[ies].</ITAG>Many bar associations, including that of the District of Columbia, operateunder procedural rules which would require a formal investigation of sucha notice, regardless of its nature. The unintended effect could be theinitiation of an investigation by a bar association for a violation whichdid not warrant further remedial action. We thus decided to limit suchreferrals to the most grievous violations; that is, those that result indebarment from practice before the ITA.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 19 CFR Parts 353, 354, and 355</ITAG>Business and industry, Foreign trade, Imports, Trade practices.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: November 21, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jan W.
