ChairmanHoward Goldfeder and other top executives are expected to leave thecompany soon after Campeau Corp. assumes control, incoming ChairmanRobert Morosky says.   ``Most of the key executives have indicated they will take theirgolden parachutes,'' Morosky, now president of Campeau-owned AlliedStores Corp., said Wednesday.   ``Golden parachutes'' are generous separation benefits commonlygiven senior executives of corporations that become takeovertargets.   While all decisions have not been made, Morosky said ``the topsix or so'' Federated executives will probably depart.   Employment contracts between the company and the top executivesrequire that each receive three years' salary and 20 percent ofindividual pay for incentive compensation upon leaving the company.   For Goldfeder, that amounts to $3.06 million, plus another $3.9million in deferred compensation, or $6.96 million.   Other top executives, their severance payments and deferredcompensation listed in the proxy statement are Norman Matthews,president and chief operating officer, $2.85 million; John W.Burden III, vice chairman, $2.31 million; Will M. Storey, vicechairman, $2.4 million; and Allen I. Questrom, vice chairman, $3.15million.   The figures do not include pensions and other benefits.   During the heat of the takeover battle for Cincinnati-basedFederated in February, the Federated board of directors fundedtrust agreements totaling $28.35 million for top executives withseverance contracts.   Goldfeder had indicated earlier he planned to leave the companyif a competing bid by R.H. Macy andamp; Co. were successful.   A Federated representative said it was premature to comment onwhich of the company's senior managers would leave.   Campeau's $73.30-a-share tender offer for all outstandingFederated stock will expire Friday at 5 p.m.   Completion of the $6.75 billion tender offer will brings to anend Toronto-based Campeau's three-month struggle to acquire thenation's fifth-largest retailer. It also will be the first step inthe merger of Federated into Campeau.   Campeau indicated that completing the merger would take at leasta month, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filingthis week.</TEXT></DOC>
