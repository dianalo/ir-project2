There was no independent confirmation of the reportedabductions, and the guerrillas did not identify the allegedkidnappers.   In Bonn, West German Foreign Ministry spokesman Hans Schumachernoted that two of the alleged victims also disappeared briefly inLebanon a year ago. He said he found their latest 10-hourdisappearance ``a bit strange.''   Lt. Col. Wajih Abu Ali, the commander of the PLO's militarypolice in Sidon, said Heinrich Struebig, 48, Petra Schnitzler, 26,and Markus Michael, 25, were abducted Thursday evening by fivegunmen outside Sidon.   All three work for the ASME-Humanitas relief agency from anoffice near the southern port city.   The Sunni Moslem Nasserite militia, which controls the areaaround Sidon, said Struebig, an administrator at ASME-Humanitas,and Ms. Schnitzler, a nurse, were freed at 5 a.m.   The two met briefly with the militia's leader, Mustafa Saad, athis office in Sidon. Reporters were kept out of the meeting andwere not allowed to speak to either of the West Germans. They hidtheir faces from photographers.   Later, Struebig and Ms. Schnitzler were driven to anASME-Humanitas base. It was closed to reporters.   ``The released two told me they are scared because thekidnappers have threatened to kill their colleague if they revealedany information about their abduction,'' Abu Ali told reporters.   In West Germany, ASME-Humanitas spokeswoman Dagmar Nackunstzsaid the group could not confirm the abductions had taken place.She confirmed Struegib and Ms. Schnitzler work for the organizationand said the group has a worker with the first name of Markus inLebanon, but she refused to give any other details.   A Palestinian officer in charge of security at the office wherethey work quoted Struebig and Schnitzler as saying Michael wasbeing held in connection with the case of Mohammed Ali Hamadi, aShiite Moslem on trial for murder and air piracy in Frankfurt.   The officer, Lt. Maarouf, who uses just one name, did not say ifany demands had been made.   ZDF, a West German television network, said the kidnappers``apparently'' gave the freed histages ``a statement with theirdemands,'' which included a light sentence for Hamadi. Itidentified the man still held as Markus Quint, 24, who joined therelief team in south Lebanon only 10 days ago.   Hamadi faces life in prison if convicted in the June 1985hijacking of a TWA jetliner and the murder of U.S. Navy diverRobert Stethem, a passenger. He admitted taking part in thehijacking but denies killing Stethem.   In January 1987, shortly after Hamadi's arrest in Frankfurt,West Germans Rudolf Cordes and Alfred Schmidt were kidnapped inLebanon. They were eventually freed, and a group that claimedresponsibility for the abductions said the releases were a gestureaimed at winning a lenient sentence for Hamadi.   The chief judge in Hamadi's trial, Heiner Mueckenberger, saidthe proceedings would not be influenced by any kidnapping.   Abu Ali told reporters five gunmen in a BMW stopped thehumanitarian workers' van and ``pointed automatic rifles at themand ordered the three to come out of the van quickly, and lie downspread-eagled.''   ``The gunmen bundled Struebig in the trunk and forced the othersto sit on their laps on the back seat of the BMW and sped awaytoward the south,'' he added.   Abu Ali said Nasserite militiamen manning a checkpoint onSidon's southern edge fired at the car ``because the driver did notstop... The vehicle's left-side mirror was hit, but the drivercontinued.''   He said Struebig and Schnitzler were released outside Sidon andtook a cab to their base.   Abu Ali said PLO chief Yasser Arafat was in ``constant contactwith us by telephone to inquire about efforts to resolve thekidnapping issue.'' He did not elaborate.   Fifteen foreigners are held hostage in Lebanon, including nineAmericans. The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson, chief MiddleEast correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March16, 1985.   Hamadi's elder brother, Abdul-Hadi, heads the security apparatusfor the Iranian-backed extremist group Hezbollah, the umbrella forunderground pro-Iranian factions holding most of the captives.   Another Hamadi brother, Abbas, was convicted in West Germany inthe kidnappings of Cordes and Schmidt.   In April 1988, Steubig and Ms. Schnitzler were thought to havebeen kidnapped after they disappeared in Lebanon for two days.   ASMA-Humanitas later said they had not been taken hostage. Itsaid a pro-Iranian Shiite group involved with their disappearanceapologized to the two after discovering their identities andsheltered them to protect them from fighting in the area.</TEXT></DOC>
