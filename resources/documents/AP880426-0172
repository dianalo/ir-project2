Wage and benefit increases for the 12 months ending in Marchaveraged 4.1 percent, compared with 3.4 percent during the previous12 months, the Labor Department said.   Over-the-year gains of 3.5 percent in basic wage rates fornon-union workers in private industry exceeded those of unionmembers at 2.6 percent, continuing a trend that has dominated mostof the decade, the department said.   But when benefits are included, that gap narrowed considerably:a 4 percent total compensation gain for non-union workers versus3.9 percent for those who belong to unions.   And in the rebounding manufacturing sector, union members withcombined wage and benefit gains averaging 5.5 percent outpacednon-union workers with an average increase of 4.2 percent, theBureau of Labor Statistics said.   The government data reflects what analysts and labor negotiatorsfor both businesses and unions have been seeing as a growing demandfor more untaxed benefits rather than taxable wage increasesdespite nominally lower tax rates.   Just last month, officials of the Teamsters union were told by180,000 members to take back a contract just negotiated with thetrucking industry and swap some of the pay increase for biggeremployer contributions to health and pension plans.   Benefit increases in the past 12 months have averaged 5.8percent overall in private industry, double the 2.9 percent rateduring the previous 12 months, the Labor Department's statisticianssaid Tuesday.   And among blue-collar workers, benefit cost increases toemployers have nearly tripled _ from a 2.3 percent gain a year agoto 6.8 percent that past 12 months. In manufacturing, the averagebenefit increase the past 12 months was 7 percent, compared withjust 1.5 percent a year ealier.   The government said the bulk of the accelerating benefitincrease is represented by escalating health insurance costs with asmaller portion coming from increased Social Security contributionsby employers.   ``Some of these benefits have turned into entitlements, and justlike the government, a lot of businesses have lost control ofthem,'' said Richard Belous, an labor economist for The ConferenceBoard, a business research group.   ``For a while, it looked like many employers were containinghealth care costs but in the last year a lot of the solutions suchas increased outpatient care and requiring second opinions beforesurgery have unraveled,'' he said. ``With mandatory healthinsurance on the horizon, a lot of companies are going to have togo back to the drawing board.''   However, John Zalusky, an economist for the AFL-CIO, said muchof the difference in the benefit increases between union andnon-union workers can be explained by the stock market crash lastOctober.   ``Union employers tend to have defined benefit pension plans,which means that when the market crashed, they had to put moremoney into the kitty,'' he said. ``Non-union employers haveswitched more to defined contribution plans in which thebeneficiaries absorbed the brunt of the crash.''   Zalusky agreed that unions are emphasizing non-pay items more atthe bargaining table, such as profit-sharing, bonus and employeestock ownership plans that don't show up in the government'scollective bargaining or employment cost figures.   ``The worker retraining programs negotiated with Ford, GeneralMotors and ATandamp;T now constitute the largest privately endowededucation program in the country,'' he said, ``and they are nowherereflected in the data.''   In a separate report, the Labor Department said first-year payincreases in major union contracts negotiated the first threemonths of 1988 averaged only 2.1 percent, excluding cost-of-livingadjustments (COLA) and lump-sum bonuses.   However, excluding the 20 percent who agreed to wage freezes _often in exchange for profit-sharing, stock ownership or bonusarrangements _ the average increase under the new contracts was 2.7percent, the department said.   Including the COLA payments and lump-sum or profit-sharingbonuses from other, older contracts, the average effective wageincrease over the past 12 months under collective bargainingagreements has been 3.8 percent, the government said.   That compares favorably with both the 2.4 percent effective wageincrease a year earlier for union members and the 3.5 percent gainthe past 12 months for non-union workers.   Earlier government data showed that union workers last yearmaintained a roughly 36 percent wage advantage over non-unionworkers _ $465 a week vs. $342 in 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
