Usually manufacturers can be sued when theirproducts are defective; under this law providers could be sued when theirproducts perform exactly as intended.;   &quot;It is only fair that those making aprofit from the gun trade should bear some of the costs,&quot; said a supportingorganization, the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence.;   &quot;It's an absurd theory oflaw,&quot; said Richard Gardiner, lawyer for the National Rifle Association, whichstands ready to help defend the first gun dealer sued. &quot;The overall effectwill be to make the District of Columbia look very foolish in the eyes of mostpeople.&quot;;   But Sherman Cohn, a specialist on liability law at the GeorgetownUniversity Law Center, said the measure might pass constitutional muster. Hecompared it to laws holding manufacturers of highly dangerous substancesresponsible for damages even when the substances are not defective.;   The lawwas enacted by a 77 percent majority. The issue reached the ballot through theefforts of the city's black clergy who said the carnage on Washington'sstreets called for a radical remedy. This year's murder pace is approachinglast year's record of 483.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Home  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911112  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  274  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday, November 12, 199100317102,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
