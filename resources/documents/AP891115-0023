Mitchell said Tuesday that the scheduling is a responseaccusations by President Bush that the Democratic-led Congress ofmoving too slowly on the bill.   Bush introduced his clean air proposal in July, calling it oneof his top priorities and promising the plan would sharply reduceurban smog, toxic chemical air pollution and acid rain by the endof the century.   Bush asked Congress to give him a clean air bill by the newyear, but sponsors of the legislation said from the start that thetimetable likely would not be met.   Moments after Mitchell, D-Maine, spoke to his colleagues on theSenate Environment subcommittee on environmental protection, thepanel completed work on clean air legislation and sent it to thefull Environment and Public Works Committee.   Earlier, members of the subcommittee complained the panel wasmoving so fast they lacked time to study last-minute acid rainproposals.   The subcommittee, which previously completed work on the urbansmog and toxic chemical portions of the legislation, approved acidrain language that incorporated much of Bush's proposal.   The full committee will begin work Thursday. While senatorsbegan their consideration later than the House, they have outpacedtheir counterparts. The House Energy and Commerce Committee isunlikely to take up the bill until next year because lawmakers planto begin their recess this month.   The Senate subcommittee accepted these Bush proposals:   _A 10 million ton reduction by the end of the century in sulfurdioxide, the chief ingredient of acid rain.   _A cap that would prevent any growth of acid rain emissions oncereduction targets are met by Jan. 1, 2000.   _Placing the cleanup burden on 107 of the nation's dirtiestcoal-burning utilities, mostly in the Midwest.   _A program of credits for utilities exceeding their reductiontargets, which could then be sold to utilities seeking to expandcapacity.   Other language, authored by subcommittee chairman Max Baucus,D-Mont., would go beyond the administration's proposal.   A second main ingredient of acid rain, nitrogen oxide, would bereduced by 1 million tons by 2000, while the Bush legislation wouldpermit a 1 million ton increase. Also, the Baucus legislation'sreduction deadline is a year ahead of the administration date.   Acid rain is a combination of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxidethat mixes in the atmosphere and is carried for hundreds of milesbefore falling in rain, snow, fog, mist and as dry particles.   The pollution makes lakes and streams acidic, killing aquaticlife; destroys trees, and can be harmful to human health. Much ofthe pollution comes from utilities that burn high sulfur coal, butother industrial facilities also contribute to the problem.   The most controversial language added by Baucus would allow sixstates to postpone meeting acid rain reduction targets, and to beassigned reductions more lenient than the rest of the country.   The language would apply to states that emitted less than150,000 tons of sulfur dioxide in 1985, provided their utilitiesinstalled devices known as scrubbers to cut pollution. The breakwould go to Baucus' state, Montana, as well as North Dakota,Wyoming, Utah, New Mexico and Minnesota.   Another Baucus provision would repeal a 1977 requirement thatnew coal-fired utilities install scrubbers. The purpose is to allowuse of low sulfur coal without requiring this expensive technology.</TEXT></DOC>
