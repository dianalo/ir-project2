Al Swift (D., Wash.) over the shape of a bill it wanted. Meanwhile it paid Mr. Swift $3,500 in personal fees, a practice Rep. Swift concedes is &quot;a little hard to totally justify.&quot;    Mr. Swift isn't alone: the NAB paid more than $100,000 this year to dozens of House and Senate members for attending board meetings in exotic resorts, brief breakfast meetings with Washington lobbyists, and the industry's annual convention, where 38 lawmakers lined up to get $1,500 each. The NAB's president, Edward Fritts, says the policy &quot;helps us become better acquainted personally with the members of Congress. And it's always easier to deal with someone if you're on a first-name basis.&quot;    The NAB is among a swelling list of lobbying groups paying lawmakers to get acquainted. Lawmakers, reluctant to raise their own pay to the levels to which many privately feel entitled, now routinely supplement their salaries by accepting fees from military suppliers, truckers, the billboard industry, cigarette makers, and commodity traders, among others.    Lobbyists are so open about paying such fees to buy lawmakers' goodwill that some Capitol Hill lawyers worry that they might some day attract unwanted attention from the Justice Department. &quot;The federal bribery statute makes it a crime to accept 'anything of value' from anyone in exchange for or on account of an official act,&quot; says Stanley Brand, former counsel to the House of Representatives. Paying lawmakers for a chance to discuss legislation &quot;could be an alluring prospect for a prosecutor looking to make an example,&quot; he says.    But Washington has come to accept such fees as a normal part of doing business.    Lawmakers still call the fees &quot;honoraria,&quot; a relic of the days when they were paid mostly by civic groups, colleges and churches for formal speeches. Now the fees increasingly come from private interests that pay as much as $2,000 -- the maximum allowed by law -- for no more than a few minutes of off-the-cuff remarks followed by a sort of bull session with lobbyists.    Such payments are &quot;a perfectly appropriate way to get members (of Congress) acquainted with your group,&quot; and vice versa, says Penelope Farthing, president of the American League of Lobbyists. &quot;Would I advise a client to set up an honoraria program? Yes, I would. And I have.&quot; She says paying fees is legal and besides, &quot;everybody else does.&quot;    In a recent paper presented to fellow lobbyists, Miss Farthing explained how to get leverage from such a program. She recommended sending invitations first to members of tax-writing committees and to senior &quot;opinion molders&quot; who lobby their colleagues. She also suggested sending a car to fetch the lawmaker &quot;whose goodwill you wish to stimulate,&quot; and making sure that &quot;the check is issued promptly.&quot;    Such payments soared despite limits on totals lawmakers may accept, currently $35,800 a year for senators and $26,850 for House members. Payments have nearly tripled in the Senate and increased almost fivefold in the House since 1980, reaching a combined total that exceeded $7.7 million last year, a record, according to a Wall Street Journal tabulation. About 22% went to charity, but the rest went into lawmakers' pockets. The total probably increased again this year, though recipients aren't required to disclose their 1987 fees until mid-1988.    The broadcasters say they will probably continue increasing their payments even though they didn't get what they wanted this year from Rep. Swift: easier procedures for getting station licenses renewed. Such fees give moneyed interests an unfair advantage, says Andrew Jay Schwartzman, head of the tax-exempt Media Access Project. He opposed the NAB on the station-license issue, and complains, &quot;I can't buy that access.&quot; He says the NAB's fees didn't sway Rep. Swift but adds that not all lawmakers are that scrupulous.    Rep. Swift says he's troubled by the payments, too. Last year he took $3,500 from the broadcasters and a free trip to the Caribbean island of St. Maarten for himself and his wife. This year his office says he took an additional $3,500. The congressman says he returned yet another check after the NAB board rejected the licensing bill he eventually introduced. He says he proved he could take the NAB's money and remain independent, but adds, &quot;I don't think that answers all the questions about the propriety of honoraria, at all.&quot;    Last year the National Restaurant Association more than doubled its payments, laying out nearly $62,000 to 52 House members and nine senators. The money is part of a still-growing program to build up lobbying muscle while lawmakers eye the prospering food-service industry as a source of tax revenue. During 1986 the association lost a fight to keep business meals fully tax-deductible, and this year it has failed to prevent Congress from imposing Social Security taxes on the tip income of waiters and waitresses.    Bill Fisher, the association's executive vice president, says the fees attract lawmakers to speak to industry officials at the association's headquarters three blocks from the Capitol.    Northrop Corp., whose officials wouldn't discuss the payments publicly, more than tripled its payments to $71,000 in 1986. The weapons maker was lobbying furiously to get support for its plan to sell F-20 fighters to the Pentagon, among other things.    Some big payers say their money isn't connected to lobbying. PaineWebber Inc., the securities firm, said the $122,000 it paid last year was intended to cultivate goodwill among its customers. &quot;It's a marketing tool,&quot; says Kristin Mannion, a PaineWebber executive. She says the company pays lawmakers to spend about half an hour at briefings for its most valued customers, including institutional money managers.    Some critics would outlaw the fees. &quot;They have simply become a vehicle for paying members of Congress for access and influence,&quot; declares Fred Wertheimer, president of Common Cause, a self-described citizens lobby which claims 280,000 members.    Most of Congress agrees, but only in private. In a soon-to-be-released survey, the nonprofit, nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics interviewed a random sample of 114 House and Senate members who were promised anonymity. More than half said they thought their job was worth more than the current $89,500 a year, and 67% said they favored raising salaries in exchange for a complete prohibition on gifts or honorariums.    But in public, it's another matter. Last January Sen. Lowell Weicker (R., Conn.), calling the fees &quot;corruption waiting to happen,&quot; forced a vote on a proposal to ban them while raising lawmakers' pay to $120,000. His amendment was rejected 93 to 2.    ---         Organizations Paying the Most Honorariums                                                  CHANGE                                      1986       FROM 1985                                    PAYMENTS   (In percent)    PaineWebber Inc.                $122,200         91%    National Association       of Broadcasters                96,000         27    Outdoor Advertising Association*  87,810         94    American Trucking Association     85,750       - 12    Connell Rice andamp; Sugar              79,000         23    Chicago Board of Trade/       Chicago Merc                   78,500       - 12    Tobacco Institute                 75,000          1    Northrop Corp.                    71,000        255    *Includes affiliates    Source: WSJ Tabulation</TEXT></DOC>
