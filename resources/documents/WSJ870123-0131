The forest products and packaging concern said it will seek shareholder approval for the split at a special meeting Feb. 16. If approved, the split will be paid Feb. 27 to stock of record on that date.    The company also said it plans to raise its quarterly dividend to 25 cents (Canadian) a share from 15 cents, payable March 16 to stock of record Feb. 27. If the split is approved, the new dividend rate will be 12.5 cents quarterly.    The company said that on an annual basis, the increased dividend will be equivalent to the dividend paid by the company in 1980 and 1981.    Timothy Wagg, vice president, finance, said the dividend was increased because of current conditions in the paper industry. The Canadian paper industry is predicting record production in 1987 and analysts are predicting improved profits for paper producers.    Consolidated-Bathurst shares closed yesterday at $30.875, up 87.5 cents, on the Montreal Exchange.    Separately, Consolidated-Bathurst said it advised its Canadian customers that it plans to increase newsprint prices by $50 (Canadian) a metric ton, or 7.9%, to $685, effective April 1. Last week, Toronto-based Abitibi-Price Inc. announced the same increase, also effective April 1. </TEXT></DOC>
