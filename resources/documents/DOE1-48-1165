<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-48-1165 </DOCNO><TEXT>This invention relates to a device for protecting fixed or floating seainstallations, for example artificial islands, against impacting icebergs.This device consists of one of more fenders at least partially surroundingthe installation at a spacing therefrom. In order to achieve that sucha device is as simple and inexpensive as possible and is simple and reliablein its functioning and operation, the fender is constructed from an independentlyfloating buoyant body which is anchored in its floating position to thesea bed and/or marine installation. The anchoring chains or ropes inclinedownwards to the sea bed and to the installation are loosely tensioned.This loose tension should be such that the deflection float is movablefrom its initial position assumed in the absence of external displacementimpact in all six spatial degrees of freedom, but assumes a central symmetricrest position relative to the marine installation to be protected.</TEXT></DOC>
