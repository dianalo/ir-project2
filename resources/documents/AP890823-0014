JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Environmentalists are criticizing a governmentplan calling for all studies on damage caused by the Exxon Valdezoil spill off the Alaskan coast to be completed by February.   ``This plan could lead to a serious underestimation of harm tothe environment and a limited recovery of damages from Exxon,''Sarah Chasis, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council,said Tuesday.   By February, Ms. Chasis said, there still will be oil on Alaskabeaches, causing additional damage.   The extent of damage on species such as the bald eagle and salmonmay not be known for years, she said, because the young born thisyear and exposed to the oil won't return to the region for three orfour years.   ``Only then will the extent of the damage begin to be known,''she said.   The timetable for completion of the studies was included Tuesdayin a 258-page government outline on how it will proceed with thestaggering task of determining how much Exxon Corp. should pay torestore the Alaska environment following damage from the March 24tanker spill that dumped 11 million gallons of oil into pristinePrince William Sound.   The document released by the Interior Department made no dollarassessment of damages and suggested in only broad terms what studiesshould be made to determine the effect of the spill on wildlife,birds, fish and other natural resources.   However, the report directs that all environmental studies to beused in determining damage should be completed over the next sixmonths.   ``No further studies will be conducted after Feb. 28, 1990,''unless a government trustee council and scientific and legal reviewgroups determine they are needed, the report said.   Interior spokesman Bob Walker acknowledged there were discussionson whether to allow longer environmental studies, but that there wasa concern such studies would drag out the process.   ``The trustees wanted to get to restoration as fast as possibleand not take a leisurely approach to studying whatever needs to bestudied,'' Walker said.   The proposed timetable and blueprint for determining damages wasprepared by government trustees _ representatives of three federalagencies and the state of Alaska _ who are charged with making thelong-term damage assessments.   Interested parties were asked to comment before the end ofSeptember, after which the blueprint becomes final. A narrowing ofthe assessment to include damage estimates in dollars and the costof restoration is not expected until late next year.   Ms. Chasis said there also is concern that the plan does not makeclear the role of Exxon in the assessment plan.   Exxon executives have said they want to participate in thedetermination of damage to wildlife and natural resources as aresult of spill. The government document said a decision on whetherto allow Exxon to participate and if so, to what extent, has notbeen made.</TEXT></DOC>
