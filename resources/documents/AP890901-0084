Assistant Transportation Secretary Jeffrey N. Shane said ininterviews this week with The Wall Street Journal and The WashingtonPost that the department ``will take active steps in response to thelevels of debt and levels of foreign ownership.''   News accounts of his remarks caused airline stocks to dropsharply Thursday, but DOT officials declined to comment on the stockmarket development today.   Shane was on vacation today and unavailable for comment. However,a DOT official said Shane's remarks reflect the feelings ofTransportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner, who has written lettersto airline officials expressing concern about leveraged buyouts _the purchase of a company using its own assets as collateral forborrowing money to complete the purchase.   Leveraged buyouts usually result in massive debt, often forcingcutbacks in unprofitable divisions or the selling off of othersdivisions or subsidiaries to help pay off the debt.   Federal officials are said to be concerned that heavy corporatedebts could weaken an airline's financial stability to operatesafely.   In such a case, or if deems management incompetent, theTransportation Department can revoke a carrier's permission to fly.   Shane told the Wall Street Journal that the agency, which wassilent on the recent leveraged buyout of NWA Inc., the parent ofNorthwest Airlines, has decided it was time to ``send a message'' tothe investment community.   ``We want to make sure people don't go off making blindassumptions about the ability of foreign carriers to buy big chunksof U.S. carriers,'' Shane told the Journal in an interview publishedThursday.   Investor Alfred Checchi bought NWA for $3.65 billion in a dealthat also involved KLM Royal Dutch Airlines.   That sale touched off a flurry of airline stock buying, inanticipation of further takeovers or mergers involving UAL Corp.,Pan Am Corp. Trans World Airlines and others.   But Shane said the Transportation Department was still reviewingthe Northwest purchase and could impose conditions that wouldprevent NWA's new owners from restructuring without DOT approval.   Under the law, foreign investors are barred from owning more than25 percent of a carrier, but the department can object to smallerstakes if it believes the foreign carrier is trying to exert control.   DOT officials also say the agency's stance is limited to airlinesand is not the vanguard of a Bush administration policy turnabout onforeign investment.</TEXT></DOC>
