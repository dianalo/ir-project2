These regulations quarantine a portion of Los AngelesCounty, California, because of the Oriental fruit fly and restrict theinterstate movement of regulated articles from the quarantined area.  The Oriental fruit fly, <T3>Dacus dorsalis </T3>(Hendel), is a destructive pest of numerous fruits(especially citrus fruits), nuts, vegetables, and berries. The Orientalfruit fly can cause serious economic losses. Heavy infestations can causecomplete loss of crops. The short life cycle of this pest permits the rapiddevelopment of serious outbreaks.  Recent trapping surveys by inspectors of California State and county agenciesand by inspectors of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS),U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), reveal that a portion of Los AngelesCounty, California, is infested with the Oriental fruit fly. Specifically,inspectors collected 11 male Oriental fruit flies and 4 female Orientalfruit flies in traps in the West Covina area of Los Angeles County betweenJune 16 and July 22, 1989. The Oriental fruit fly is not known to occuranywhere else in the continental United States.  Officials of State agencies of California have begun an intensive Orientalfruit fly eradication program in the quarantined area in California. Also,as explained below, California has taken action to restrict the intrastatemovement of certain articles from the quarantined area to prevent the spreadof the Oriental fruit fly within California. However, it is also necessaryto restrict the interstate movement of certain articles from the quarantinedarea to prevent the spread of the Oriental fruit fly to other States. Accordingly,to prevent the spread of the Oriental fruit fly, this document establishesFederal regulations, which are described below by section. <ITAG tagnum="84">Restrictions on Interstate Movement of Regulated Articles (Section301.93)  </ITAG>Section 301.93 prohibits any person from moving any regulated article interstatefrom any quarantined area except in accordance with conditions prescribedin the regulations. For informational purposes, a footnote (number 1) hasbeen added to reference the authority of an inspector to stop and inspectpersons and means of conveyance, and to seize, quarantine, treat, applyremedial measures to, or otherwise dispose of regulated articles as providedin section 10 of the Plant Quarantine Act (7 U.S.C. 164a) and sections105 and 107 of the Federal Plant Pest Act (7 U.S.C. 150dd, 150ff). <ITAG tagnum="84">Definitions (Section 301.93-1)  </ITAG>Section 301.93-1 contains, for informational purposes, definitions of thefollowing terms: ``Administrator,'' ``Animal and Plant Health InspectionService,'' ``Certificate,'' ``Compliance Agreement,'' ``Core area,'' ``Daydegrees,'' ``Infestation,'' ``Inspector,'' ``Interstate,'' ``Limited permit,''``Moved (Move, Movement),'' ``Oriental fruit fly,'' ``Person,'' ``QuarantinedArea,'' ``Regulated article,'' and ``State.''  <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulated Articles (Section 301.93-2)  </ITAG>The regulations impose conditions on the interstate movement of those articlesthat present a significant risk of spreading Oriental fruit fly if movedwithout restrictions from quarantined areas into or through noninfestedareas. These articles, which are designated as regulated articles, maynot be moved interstate from quarantined areas except in accordance withconditions specified in andSection;andSection;301.93-4 through 301.93-10. Section 301.93-2 designates as regulated articles a number of fruits, nuts,vegetables, and berries, and soil within the drip line of plants that producethe fruits, nuts, vegetables, or berries. Based on research and experience,the regulated articles listed in andSection;301.93-2(a) and (b) are articlesthat are likely to cause the spread of the Oriental fruit fly. In addition,andSection;301.93-2(c) allows designation of any other product, article,or means of conveyance as a regulated article if an inspector determinesthat it presents a risk of spreading the Oriental fruit fly and notifiesthe person in possession of the product, article, or means of conveyancethat it is subject to the restrictions in the regulations. This provisionfor ``any other product, article, or means of conveyance'' allows an inspectorwho discovers a risk of spreading Oriental fruit fly (e.g., a truck withOriental fruit fly pupae in cracks in the floorboards) to regulate theaffected articles immediately, by informing the person in possession ofthe product, article or means of conveyance that it is being regulated.Fruits, nuts, vegetables, or berries that are canned, dried, or frozenbelow ^17.8 anddegrees;C. (0 anddegrees;F.) are not included as regulated articlessince the Oriental fruit fly could not survive under those conditions.<ITAG tagnum="84">Quarantined Area (Section 301.93-3)  </ITAG>As stated in andSection;301.93-3(a), it is necessary to quarantine areasin which the Oriental fruit fly has been found by an inspector, areas inwhich the Administrator has reason to believe the Oriental fruit fly ispresent, and areas the Administrator considers necessary to quarantinebecause of their proximity to the Oriental fruit fly or their inseparabilityfor quarantine enforcement purposes from localities where Oriental fruitflies have been found.  Section 301.93-3(a) further provides that less than an entire State willbe designated as a quarantined area only if the Administrator determinesthat (1) the State has adopted and is enforcing restrictions on the intrastatemovement of the regulated articles that are substantially the same as thosethat are imposed by our regulations with respect to the interstate movementof these articles; and (2) quarantining less than the entire State willprevent the interstate spread of the Oriental fruit fly. These determinationswould indicate that infestations are confined to the quarantined areasand eliminate the need for designating an entire State as a quarantinedarea.       In accordance with these criteria, we are designating as a quarantinedarea an area in Los Angeles County in California. This area is as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Los Angeles County</T3>_That portion of the county in the West Covinaarea bounded by a line beginning at the intersection of Sunset Avenue andSan Bernardino Road, then east along San Bernardino Road to its intersectionwith Grand Avenue, then south along Grand Avenue to its intersection withBadillo Street, then east along Badillo Street to its intersection withReeder Avenue, then south along Reeder Avenue to its intersection withPuente Street, then southeast along Puente Street to its intersection withVia Verde, then east along Via Verde to its intersection with InterstateHighway 210, then south along Interstate Highway 210 to its intersectionwith State Highway 57, then south along State Highway 57 to its intersectionwith Highland Valley Road, then southeast along Highland Valley Road toits intersection with Diamond Bar Boulevard, then southwest along DiamondBar Boulevard to its intersection with State Highway 57, then west alongan imaginary line from this intersection to the intersection of FullertonRoad and Skyline Drive, then northwest along Skyline Drive to its intersectionwith Suncrest Court, then northwest along an inaginary line from this intersectionto the intersection of Colima Road and Stimson Avenue, then north alongStimson Avenue to its intersection with Halliburton Road, then west alongHalliburton Road to its intersection with Hacienda Boulevard, then northalong Hacienda Boulevard to its intersection with State Highway 60, thennorthwest along State Highway 60 to its intersection with 7th Avenue, thennortheast along 7th Avenue to its intersection with Valley Boulevard andSunset Avenue, then northeast along Sunset Avenue to the point of beginning.</ITAG>It is necessary to designate this portion of Los Angeles County as a quarantinedarea because it is an area in which the Oriental fruit fly has been found,or in which the Administrator has reason to believe the Oriental fruitfly is present, or an area necessary to regulate because of its proximityto the Oriental fruit fly or its inseparability for quarantine enforcementpurposes from localities where Oriental fruit fly has been found.There does not appear to be any reason to designate any other quarantinedareas in Califorina other than the area specified above. California hasadopted and is enforcing regulations imposing restrictions on the intrastatemovement of the regulated articles that are substantially the same as thoseimposed on the interstate movement of regulated articles under this subpart.Section 301.93-3(b) provides that the Administrator or an inspector maydesignate an area as a quarantined area temporarily without publicationin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> if there is a basis for listing the area as aquarantined area under andSection; 301.93-3(a) and if the owner or personin possession of the area to be quarantined is given written notice ofthis action. This is necessary in order to prevent spread of the Orientalfruit fly before restrictions can be published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> concerning the interstate movement of regulatedarticles from the designated area.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conditions Governing the Interstate Movement of Regulated ArticlesFrom Quarantined Areas (Sections 301.93-4 through 301.93-10) Section 301.93-4</ITAG>Section 301.93-4(a) requires regulated articles moved interstate from quarantinedareas to be accompanied by a certificate or limited permit issued and attachedas prescribed by andSection;andSection; 301.93-5 and 301.93-8, unless movedas prescribed in andSection; 301.93-4(b).Section 301.93-4(b) allows a regulated article to move interstate withouta certificate or limited permit if the article originates outside of aquarantined area, if it is moved directly through the quarantined areawithout stopping except for refueling or for traffic conditions such astraffic lights and stop signs, if it is shipped in an enclosed vehicleor is completely covered so as to prevent access by Oriental fruit flies,if the point of origin is indicated on the waybill, and if the enclosedvehicle or the enclosure which contains the regulated article is not opened,unpacked, or unloaded in the quarantined area.Also, andSection; 301.93-4(c) allows the Department to move regulated articlesinterstate without a certificate or limited permit for experimental orscientific purposes. However, the regulated articles must be moved in accordancewith a permit issued by the Administrator, under conditions that preventthe spread of the Oriental fruit fly.Section 301.93-4 contains a footnote (number 2) to remind persons thatother applicable domestic plant quarantine and regulation requirementsmay need to be met for interestate movement.Section 301.93-5Under Federal domestic plant quarantine programs, there is a differencebetween the use of certificates and limited permits. Certificates are issuedfor regulated articles upon a finding by an inspector that, because ofcertain conditions (e.g. the article is free of Oriental fruit fly), thereis an absence of a pest risk prior to movement. Regulated articles accompaniedby a certificate can be moved interstate without further restrictions beingimposed. Limited permits are issued for regulated articles when an inspectorhas determined that, because of a possible pest risk, such articles maybe safely moved interstate only subject to further restrictions, such asmovement to limited areas and movement for limited purposes. Section 301.93-5explains the conditions for issuing a certificate or limited permit.Specifically, andSection; 301.93-5(a) provides that a certificate will beissued by an inspector for the movement of a regulated article if the inspectordetermines that the article: (1) is free of Oriental fruit fly, has beentreated under direction of an inspector in accordance with andSection; 301.93-10,or comes from premises of origin free from Oriental fruit fly and has notbeen exposed to Oriental fruit fly; (2) will be moved in compliance withany additional emergency conditions deemed necessary to prevent the spreadof Oriental fruit fly pursuant to section 105 of the Federal Plant PestAct; and (3) is eligible for unrestricted movement under all other Federaldomestic plant quarantines and regulations applicable to that article.A footnote (number 3) is added to provide information on the location ofinspectors.A footnote (number 4) explains that the Secretary of Agriculture may, pursuantto section 105 of the Federal Plant Pest Act (7 U.S.C. 150dd), take emergencyactions.Section 301.93-5(b) provides for the issuance of a limited permit (in lieuof a certificate) by an inspector for movement of a regulated article ifthe inspector determines that the article is to be moved to a specifieddestination for specified handling, utiization or processing, and thatthe movement will not result in the spread of Oriental fruit fly.Section 301.93-5(c) allows any person who has entered into and is operatingunder a compliance agreement to execute a certificate or limited permitfor the interstate movement of a regulated article after an inspector hasmade a determination that the article is eligible for a certificate orlimited permit in accordance with andSection; 301.93-5(a) or (b).Also andSection; 301.93-5(d) contains provisions for the withdrawal of acertificate or limited permit by an inspector upon a determination by theinspector that the holder of the certificate or limited permit has notcomplied with conditions for the use of the document. This section alsocontains provisions for notifying the holder of the reasons for the withdrawaland for holding a hearing if there is any conflict concerning any materialfact.Section 301.93-6Section 301.93-6 provides for the issuance and cancellation of complianceagreements. Specifically, compliance agreements may be entered into byany person engaged in growing, handling, or moving regulated articles whoagrees in writing to comply with the provisions of subpart 301.93. Complianceagreements are provided for the convenience of persons who are involvedin frequent shipments of regulated articles from quarantined areas; theyare written to ensure that persons issuing certificates or limited permitsare knowledgeable with respect to the requirements of Subpart 301.93 andhave agreed to comply with them.Section 301.93-6 also provides that an inspector supervising enforcementof a compliance agreement may cancel the agreement upon finding that aperson who has entered into the agreement has failed to comply with anyof the provisions of the regulations. The inspector will notify the holderof the compliance agreement of the reasons for cancellation and offer anopportunity for a hearing to resolve any conflicts of material fact. Thissection contains a footnote (number 5) to explain where compliance agreementforms can be obtained.Sections 301.93-7, 301.93-8, and 301.93-9Section 301.93-7 provides that any person who desires a certificate orlimited permit to move regulated articles must as far in advance of movementas possible (no less than 48 hours before the desired movement), requestan inspector to issue a certificate or limited permit. This provision ensuresthat persons desiring inspection services can obtain them before the intendedmovement date. A footnote (number 3) is added for informational purposesto indicate how to contact the inspectors for inspection or how to obtainadditional information from offices of the Animal and Plant Health InspectionService.Section 301.93-8 requires the certificate or limited permit issued forthe movement of the regulated article to be attached to the regulated article,or to a container carrying the regulated article, or to the accompanyingwaybill during the interstate movement. This provision is necessary forenforcement purposes.Section 301.93-9 explains the APHIS policy that services of an inspectorthat are needed to comply with the provisions of the regulations in subpart301.93 are provided without cost during normal business hours (8:00 a.m.to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, except holidays), but that we willnot be responsible for any other costs or charges.Section 301.93-10Section 301.93-10 sets forth treatment schedules that qualify cucumbersand soil for the issuance of a certificate as provided in andSection; 301.93-5,and a treatment for premises on which regulated articles are grown. Thissection also identifies treatments for the Oriental fruit fly that arecontained in the Plant Protection and Quarantine Treatment Manual. ThePlant Protection and Quarantine Treatment Manual is incorporated by referencein the Code of Federal Regulations in 7 CFR part 300. Research has determinedthat these treatments would be adequate to destroy the Oriental fruit fly.Section 301.93-10 also includes a footnote (number 6) stating that somevarieties of fruit may be injured by one of the approved treatments (methylbromide) and that shippers should test before making commercial shipments.The treatment schedules for cucumbers, soil, and premises in andSection;301.93-10 are as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">(a) Cucumbers: Fumigation at NAP (chamber or tarpaulin) with 32 g/m\3\methyl bromide for 4 hours at 70 anddegrees;F or above, minimum gas readings26 g/m\3\ at \1/2\ hour, 20 g/m\3\ at 2 hours, 19 g/m\3\ at 4 hours; or,fumigation at NAP (chamber or tarpaulin) with 48 g/m\3\ methyl bromidefor 2 hours at 70 anddegrees;F or above, minimum gas readings 40 g/m\3\ at\1/2\ hour, 30 g/m\3\ at 2 hours.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) Soil: Soil within the drip area of plants that are producing orhave produced the fruits, nuts, vegetables, and berries listed in andSection;301.93-2(a) of this subpart: Apply diazinon at the rate of 5 pounds actualingredient per acre to the soil within the drip area with sufficient waterto wet the soil to a depth of at least \1/2\ inch. Both immersion and pour-ontreatment procedures are also acceptable.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(c) Premises: A field, grove, or area that is located within the quarantinedarea but outside the infested core area, and that produces regulated articles,must receive regular treatments with malathion bait spray at 6 to 10-dayintervals, starting at least 30 days before harvest and continuing throughthe harvest period. The malathion bait spray treatment must be appliedby ground equipment at a rate of 2.4 ounces of technical grade malathionand 9.6 ounces of protein hydrolysate per acre.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Emergency Action</ITAG>James W. Glosser, Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health InspectionService, has determined that there is good cause for publishing this rulewithout prior opportunity for public comment. Immediate action is necessaryto prevent the Oriental fruit fly from spreading to noninfested areas ofthe United States.Since prior notice and other public procedures with respect to this interimrule are impracticable and contrary to the public interest under theseconditions, there is good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553 to make it effectiveupon signature. We will consider comments that are received within 60 daysof publication of this interim rule in the<T4> Federal Register</T4>. After the comment period closes, we will publishanother document in the<T4> Federal Register</T4>, including discussion of any comments we receiveand any amendments we are making to the rule as a result of the comments.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 and Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>We are issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12291, andwe have determined that it is not a ``major rule.'' Based on informationcompiled by the Department, we have determined that this rule will havean effect on the economy of less than $100 million; will not cause a majorincrease in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal,State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; and will notcause a significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived the reviewprocess required by Executive Order 12291.This interim rule restricts the interstate movement of regulated articlesfrom a portion of Los Angeles County, California. It appears that thereis very little commercial activity in the quarantined area that may beaffected by this rule. The small entities that may be affected appear toconsist of approximately 75 nurseries, 2 community gardens, 2 fruit stands,and 25 locations producing cucumbers, tomatoes, and avocados.These small entities comprise less than \1/2\ of 1 percent of the totalnumber of small entities that move these articles interstate from nonquarantinedareas in California. In addition, these small entities sell regulated articlesprimarily for local intrastate, not interstate, movement. Also, many ofthe nurseries sell other items in addition to the regulated articles sothat the effect, if any, of this regulation on these entities appears tobe minimal.The effect on those few entities that do move regulated articles interstatewill be minimized by the availability of various treatments that, in mostcases, will allow these small entities to move regulated articles interstatewith very little additional cost.Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant HealthInspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>The regulations in this subpart contain no information collection or recordkeepingrequirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501<T3>et seq.</T3>).<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12372</ITAG>This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistanceunder No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372, which requiresintergovernmental consultation with State and local officials.
