Capt. Fred P. Moosally also told the Senate Armed ServicesCommittee that allegations of poor training and lack ofqualifications leveled against his crew imediately after theexplosion April 19 were unwarranted.   He said he had no information to dispute the Navy's conclusionthat the blast was ``a wrongful, intentional act.'' But he said hecould not conclude that a single individual was responsible.   The Navy concluded that a depressed Gunner's Mate ClaytonHartwig ``most likely'' caused the explosion by inserting some typeof detonator between bags of gunpowder in one of the ship's 16-inchguns.   Navy officials acknowledged their evidence was circumstantialbecause all the witnesses, including Hartwig, were killed in theblast.   ``I don't think I could definitely say an individual did it,''Moosally said today.   The Navy's report on the explosion acknowledged deficiencies inthe way Iowa sailors were supposed to be certified to carry outtheir jobs aboard ship, but it said these problems did not causethe blast.   In the weeks immediately after the blast, Moosally toldinvestigators that he was concerned about the quality of thepersonnel aboard his ship.   He complained that the sailors assigned to the Iowa were``dopers, marginal performers, constant UA (unauthorizedabsences),'' according to published accounts of his testimony toNavy investigastors.   He has since said he regreted his harsh remarks about his crews,which he said amounted to an emotional outburst after the tragedy.   Asked today about those comments, Moosally told senators:   ``You have before you a paradox, a tale of two ships. One shipyou read about in the newspapers is a ship of laid-back attitudes,failure and ineptitude. The other Iowa is the Iowa that I command:well-trained, well-maintained and professional.''   Moosally said that when he assumed command of the Iowa in May1988, the ship was fraught with problems, including absenteeism anddrug abuse.   But in 19 months the Iowa had become one of the finest ships inthe Navy, and when the explosion ripped through gun turret No. 2,it was ``both a tragedy and the birth of 100 heroes,'' he said.   Moosally said the Navy inquiry into the blast was ``generallyspeaking'' fair.   The captain said he disagreed with some of the charges ofshipboard deficiencies. But when asked if he was aware of anyinformation that would contradict the service's overallconclusions, he said initially, ``Not that I am aware of.''   Shortly after the Iowa returned home to Norfolk, Va., lastThursday, Moosally also told reporters he believes the Navy'sreport on the explosion closes the book on the matter.   But skeptical lawmakers do not see it the same way.   ``We want a resolution to the problems. We want to get to thebottom of it once and for all,'' said Rep. Nicholas Mavroules,D-Mass., chairman of the House Armed Services subcommittee oninvestigations.   That panel has scheduled hearings on the Iowa explosion onTuesday and Wednesday.   Among the witnesses scheduled to appear under oath beforeMavroules' subcommittee are Moosally; Rear Adm. Richard Milligan,who oversaw the technical and criminal study; and Kendall Truitt, asailor on the ship when an explosion ripped through the lowestlevel of the No. 2 gun turret.   Several analysts from the FBI and the Naval InvestigativeService as well as outside experts will be questioned.   In announcing his committee's hearings, Mavroules said the panelhas been reviewing ``several aspects of the Navy investigation _especially its technical competence and psychological analysis.''   The Massachusetts Democrat expressed concern about a ``questionof interpretation'' of the evidence.   In October, Mavroules said he ``seriously questioned'' theNavy's report, and cited an FBI report that said its laboratoryinvestigation on the incident was inconclusive.   ``We didn't find anything that would lead us to conclude that adevice was used to prematurely detonate the charge,'' the FBI saidin October. ``That's not to say something wasn't there. Ourfindings were inconclusive.''   In a Nov. 21 memorandum to members of the subcommittee,Mavroules questioned why the report was described as inconclusive.   ``I do not see it that way. It clearly says they did not findelements that the Navy technicians said they found. Why is therethis discrepancy?'' he wrote.   Mavroules also criticized the use of the FBI psychologicalprofile of the sailors which ``was intended to produce leads;instead, it was used as a key document supporting theinvestigation.''   Despite the skepticism, the Navy defended its findings intestimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee last month.   Milligan said additional technical tests conducted since heissued his report found ``unique foreign material'' on theprojectile from the exploding gun barrel that would not have beenpresent during a normal firing.   The new tests identified the material as iron wires coated withcalcium, chlorine and oxygen, which would be produced by ``sometypes of non-electronic explosive devices,'' Milligan said.</TEXT></DOC>
