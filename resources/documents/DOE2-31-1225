Fifty-four patients in dialysis treatmentfor end-stage renal failure (ESRF) were examined over a six-year periodfor vascular access (VA) complications. Eighty vascular accesses werestudied: 68 arteriovenous fistulas and 12 arteriovenous grafts. The mostfrequent radiological investigation was flebography, followed by arteriographyby direct puncture of the humeral artery, and, in few cases only, byarteriography through femoral approach; the total number of radiographicexaminations performed was 101. The most frequent complications werethromboses (50%) and stenoses (21%); aneurysms, pseudoaneurysms and radialartery steals were observed in 11% of the cases. Findings prove complicationsto depend neither on the type of VA (fistula, prosthesis) nor on itssite (proximal, distal). In 50% of the cases angiography allowed a therapyto be adopted for VA recovery. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty(PTA), performed on 3 patients, failed. Thus, in the authors' opinion,angiography is the method of choice for the most efficient treatmentfor complications. Despite failures, PTA represent a valid alternativein the treatment of stenoses in lager vessels and prostheses.</TEXT></DOC>
