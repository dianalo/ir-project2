Hilder (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> GOVMT </CO><IN> BNK TNM </IN><TEXT>   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board plans to announce today a record-high cash payout of more than $1 billion to liquidate an insolvent thrift, a Bank Board spokesman said.    Bank Board spokesman Karl Hoyle confirmed a report in Barron's Financial Weekly, which said that the record payout was expected this week.    The Orange County (Calif.) Register identified the insolvent thrift as American Diversified Savings Bank of Costa Mesa, Calif. The Register reported that the Bank Board also plans to liquidate this week North America Savings andamp; Loan, also of Costa Mesa. Mr. Hoyle declined to comment on specific institutions.    American Diversified recently advertised that its assets exceed $500 million. However, its negative net worth, or assets minus liabilities, also has been in the range of $500 million. When the Bank Board took over North America in late 1986, its assets were about $200 million.    The most expensive previous thrift liquidation, about four years ago, cost about $300 million. That closure involved Empire Savings andamp; Loan of Mesquite, Texas, a suburb of Dallas.    The Bank Board prefers to merge sick thrifts rather than liquidate them, believing that mergers are less expensive. But some thrifts have too few local depositors to have value for potential merger partners.    Late last month, the Bank Board approved a merger that it expects will cost $2 billion in federal assistance. In that transaction, Southwest Savings Association of Dallas acquired four insolvent institutions in Texas.    American Diversified and North America both relied heavily on broker deposits for their funds, for which they paid premium rates.    Last week, for example, American Diversified was offering to pay 8% on six-month deposits and 8.25% on one-year deposits, requiring a minimum deposit of $90,000.    Both institutions were taken over by the Bank Board more than a year ago.They were put into the Bank Board's so-called Management Consignment Program, under which institutions are managed by executives on loan from healthy thrifts or by private consultants.    In the last few months, members of the Bank Board have on several occasions telephoned managers of thrifts in the Management Consignment Program and ordered them to lower the rates they were offering to attract deposits. The Bank Board's staff members said these calls were part of an overall effort to bring down the thrift industry's cost of funds.    In liquidating the two California thrifts, the Bank Board is attempting to remove high-interest-rate deposits from the market. High rates from such institutions drive up the costs of funds for competing thrifts. This is the strongest initiative to date in the Bank Board's drive to bring down the deposit costs for the entire savings and loan industry.    Under a liquidation, the Bank Board's Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. unit pays depositors for deposits, which it insures at as much as $100,000. </TEXT></DOC>
