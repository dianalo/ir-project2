Any such approval would escalate a trade dispute between theUnited States and the European Economic Community sparked by aEuropean ban on imports of American meat treated with growthhormones.   Nico Wegter, an EEC spokesman, said Thursday that representativesof the 12 nations making up the Common Market trading bloc will begiven a proposal calling for the retaliatory measures.   The plan, drawn up by the bloc's executive body, the EuropeanCommission, will be offered to counter sanctions the United Statesput into effect Sunday to retaliate against the European meat ban.   American officials have raised the possibility of taking moreactions against the Europeans if the trading bloc strikes back.   Wegter said the proposal recommends imposing 100 percent tariffson dried fruit and walnut imports from the United States. An earlierlist had included honey and canned corn.   Total EEC imports of walnuts, mostly to Germany, averaged $58.8million annually over the 1985-87 period, Wegter said. Dried fruitimports, mainly to Germany and Italy, averaged $37.8 million duringthat period. Dried fruit products include apples, pears, apricots,peaches, prunes and papayas.   The commission's proposal does not set a date for application ofthe tariffs but recommends they be put in place as soon as possible.   The trade fight was set off by the enforcement on Sunday of anEEC ban on imports of meat from cattle treated with growth hormones.The trading bloc wants to prohibit for health reasons all meat fromsuch animals.   The ban is expected to halt the importation of about $100 millionworth of beef and beef byproducts from the United States, some ofwhich are used in pates and sausages. Meat used to make pet food isexempted.   U.S. officials contend the use of certain hormones to fattencattle, a common practice among American farmers, does not pose ahealth risk.   The ban was to have taken effect Jan. 1, 1988, but the tradingbloc agreed to delay it for a year. It has since refused Americanappeals for yet another postponement.   The meat imports represent a small portion of the estimated $166billion in trade between the United States and the Common Market.   In retaliation for the meat ban, the United States on Sundayimposed 100 percent duties on boneless beef, hams and porkshoulders, prepared or preserved tomatoes, instant coffee, fermentedalcoholic beverages containing less than 7 percent alcohol byvolume, certain fruit juices, and certain packaged pet food madefrom grains. The sanctions are worth about $100 million.   The Common Market has filed a complaint with the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade to protest the U.S. sanctions. The96-nation GATT is both an agreement and a forum for ensuring thefree movement off goods around the world. The complaint was filed inNovember before the sanctions went into effect.</TEXT></DOC>
