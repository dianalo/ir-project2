It will take at least two weeks for the Democratic-controlledchamber to plow through the huge bill and the 240 amendments whichalready have been proposed.   The Pentagon budget sparks long debate each year, Aspin noted,because House rules require that amendments be germane to thesubject of the bill at hand.   That tends to limit debate on other measures, but Aspin said,``Anyone who wants to offer an amendment on just about anything canfind something in the defense bill that it is germane to.''   The bill authorizes the Pentagon to spend $299 billion in thefiscal year beginning Oct. 1, an amount that was set five monthsago. White House and congressional leaders agreed on the overallfigure in December as part of a package designed to reduce federaldeficits.   The agreement on the overall budget ``left us free toconcentrate on smaller issues,'' Aspin noted. It also speeded upthe process of writing the bill, which normally doesn't go to theHouse floor until June or later.   The $299 billion is $33 billion less than the Pentagon hadexpected to have, and Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci has orderedreductions in a number of programs to meet that goal.   While the total budget is less than the Pentagon wanted, thehuge bill includes money to buy another Trident missile-firingsubmarine, two more attack submarines, the first of a new class ofSeawolf subs, 180 F-16 jets, 42 F-15s, 72 Apache attackhelicopters, 611 M-1 tanks, 550 Bradley Fighting Vehicles, andthree Navy destroyers.   The measure which passes the House will eventually have to bereconciled with the bill the Senate approves. The Senate ArmedServices Committee has just begun the process of writing itsdefense bill, meaning the measure isn't likely to reach the Senatefloor until mid-year or later.   As in past years, one of the major battles will be over thebudget for Reagan's Star Wars program, known formally as theStrategic Defense Initiative.   Reagan sought $4.8 billion for the program, which is receiving$3.9 billion this year. But Aspin's committee cut the figure to$4.0 billion, barely above the current budget and $600 million lessthan the amount set last week by a Senate subcommittee.   ``I expect we'll have moves on the Star Wars budget from boththe right and left,'' said Aspin, explaining that conservativeswill try to increase the SDI budget while liberals will seek to cutit.   During the committee consideration of the bill, there were fouramendments to set the SDI budget and at least that many are likelyto be offered on the floor.   Another contentious issue is the Midgetman versus MX fight. Boththe nuclear weapons are land-based missiles and are designed toreplace the aging Minuteman as part of the nation's atomicdeterrence force.   Reagan originally wanted 100 of the 10-warhead MX weapons, butCongress approved only 50 for basing in western silos and said thePentagon should develop the single-warhead, mobile Midgetmanbecause it would be easier to hide from Soviet attack.   Now, the Pentagon is proposing to build 50 more MX weapons andput them aboard trains to make it tougher for the Soviets to findthe missiles.   Reagan sought $840 million for the railroad version of the MXand $200 million for research into Midgetman. Carlucci said thelatter amount was included only to meet a congressional request tokeep the program alive until Reagan's successor can make a decisionon its future.   But Aspin's committee gave $500 million each to Midgetman and MXand ``you'll see a number of amendments to re-divide that pie onthe floor,'' he said. ``I don't know where we'll come outeventually on that one.''   The House will also consider a variety of arms controlrestrictions, similar to those which were added on the House floorlast year.   One would require continued U.S. adherence to the unratifiedSALT II nuclear arms treaty, a pact that Reagan says he will nolonger follow. Another would block all but the smallest tests ofU.S. nuclear weapons, while a third would continue a 3-year-oldmoratorium set by Congress on testing of anti-satellite weapons.The administration opposes all three measures.</TEXT></DOC>
