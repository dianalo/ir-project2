(Products).andO;Ticker:    IBM.andO;Product:   OS/400 2.1 (Operating system) (Usage)IBM AS/400 (Minicomputer) (Computer programs).andO;Topic:     Operating SystemsUpgradingMinicomputersConnectivityFunctional Capabilities.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>THE APRIL announcement of the AS/400 D models, with performance improvementsfrom 30 to 60 percent over the B and C models, provide an attractive hardwareupgrade path for midrange users.andP;  Along with the introduction of the new Dmodel hardware, however, came the introduction of the OS/400 Version 2Release 1 (V2R1) operating system.andP;  Anyone interested in the benefits of thenew hardware will have to consider an upgrade to V2 as well.andM;V2R1 offers a number of new and enhanced functions that may be an enticementto a software upgrade even without a move to the new hardware.andP;  But like itor not, the future is likely to include an upgrade to V2 for AS/400 users.andM;The new D models require V2R1.andP;  IBM preloads the operating system inRochester, Minn., before the new hardware is shipped to customers.andP;  AllAS/400 B and C models are field upgradeable to D models, but a hardwareupgrade of the older models will require an operating system upgrade as well.andM;Although at the time of its annoucement V2R1 could only be loaded on top ofV1R3, not on V1R2, as of September this restriction no longer held.andO;Modifications to V2 allow it to be loaded on V1R2 as well as R3.andP;  V2R1 can beloaded on any existing AS/400 B or C model.andM;In networked systems, the two operating system versions -- V1 and V2 -- arecompatible.andP;  An AS/400 running under V2R1 can exchange data with an AS/400running under any release of OS/400.andP;  In addition, an AS/400 with V2R1 canexchange data with any System/36 or System/38 running under the lastsupported release of that system's operating system.andM;For V1 users, V2R1 is available for no charge if ordered before September1992 and installed before December 1992.andP;  Support for V1 will be discontinuedin May 1993.andP;  Although IBM representatives have no comment, industryspeculation has it that V3 can be expected in 1994.andP;  When it is announced,users can expect to be charged for it, although until then new releases andmodifications for V2 will be provided at no cost.andM;While users are allowed plenty of time to make the move to V2, IBM clearly isencouraging current V1 users to do so.andP;  And while they can expect to gainsuperior function from the new operating system, being charged for the newversion marks a change in IBM's past policy.andP;  From now on, IBM has addedsystem software to its revenue formula.andM;As Kirk Staff, manager of technical support for Advanced System Concepts(Schaumburg, Ill.), excplains, &quot;In the past, if I bought the hardware on theS/38, I paid one price for the operating system and never paid for theoperating system again regardless of how many hardware upgrades I wentthrough.&quot;andM;He continues, &quot;The difference now is that IBM has decided that the AS/400 isgoing to be around a lot longer than the S/34, S/36 or S/38.andP;  IBM's dilemmais that it will therefore have to provide more system software upgrades, asituation in which there would be no additional revenue generated from thesystems already installed.andP;  This policy change reflects IBM's decision tomake customers pay for more function.&quot;andM;WHAT TO LOOK FORandM;According to IBM pricing information, the normal charge for an operatingsystem upgrade, although waived for V2 until September 1992, will be thedifference between the cost of the software charges for a customer's presentsystem and software charges for the upgraded system -- the cost of the newminus the cost of the old.andM;What improvements will a purchaser of V2R1 buy?andP;  There have been many.andP;  Somenoteworthy examples are in ease of use, connectivity, APIs and improvementsin the S/36 environment.andM;Ease of use has been improved by the integration of the Operational Assistantfeature in V2, an option in V1R3.andP;  From a systems management point of view,Operational Assistant enchancements make it easier to understand devicestatus, simple to enroll and remove users, and less complex to set up afterinstallation.andP;  For end users, Operational Assistance displays can bespecified at three levels: basic, intermediate and advanced.andM;The basic level provides the most assistance.andP;  Computer terminology is notused and only the most common choices and options are available.andP;  Theintermediate level uses computer terminology and displays all availablechoices and options with option key descriptions.andP;  The advanced level is likethe imtermediate level, but key descriptions are not shown.andP;  Users canspecify which assistance level they want, and the system remembers the levelselected.andM;Communications improvements include support for different release levels ofOS/400 on a single network and improved Token-Ring performance permittingfaster data throughput and the connection of more devices.andP;  Improvements toAPPC and APPN have been added as well.andM;The SAA Common Programming Interface (CPI) for Communications is availablefor SAA environments, including OS/2 VM/ESA and MVS/ESA.andP;  CPI Communicationsis available from every SAA language on the AS/400.andM;The APIs include a communications interface to support vendor-specificcommunications protocols such as DECNet, Novell or X.25 packet layer, as longas the the underlying support is X.25 Ethernet or Token-Ring.andP;  Other APIsprovide an interface to allow OEM terminal emulation programs and aninterface to a hierarchical file system.andP;  These provide the ability to accessthe hierarchical file system used in PC Support and Office-Vision/400,permitting such functions as opening and closing folders; read folderentries; and open, read and write documents.andP;  Other APIs support remotedatabase access from SQL allowing DOS and OS/2 developers to writecooperative software applications using SQL to access an AS/400 database.andM;V2 improves the performance of the AS/400's S/36 environment, a benefit forS/36 users moving to the AS/400 platform.andP;  According to Mike Coppert, IBMtechnical marketing support representative for the AS/400 (Rochester, Minn.),andO;&quot;In V2R1 for the S/36 environment, we have provided better performance forthe way programs operate and have changed the way the machine handles asecondary startup.andP;  Both are faster.&quot;andM;He continues, &quot;Another area we have focused on is file management.andP;  TheAS/400 now behaves much more quickly in the way a S/36 application createsand deletes files on the fly.&quot;andP;  Deleted files are cleared and moved to acache library.andP;  When a BLDFILE operation is executed for a similar file, thecomputer selects a file from the cache library rather than creating a newfile.andM;Another improvement, almost by necessity, is data compression.andP;  According toCoppert, IBM has added a lot of new or changed code to this release, to thetune of 1.4 million line.andP;  &quot;As the function of the system grows, we don'tnecessarily want to expand the amount of space required in disk storage,especially in the smaller 9402 and 9404 machines,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;We are shippingOS/400 with a compression algorithm for objects such as programs, panelgroups, and display and print files.&quot;andM;Elements of the operating system are shipped in compressed format.andP;  If 500MBof DASD are available, all compressed objects are decompressed when theoperating system is loaded.andP;  If sufficient space is unavailable, objects aredynamically decompressed when they are first used.andP;  Depending on usage, themachine decides if the decompression is permanent.andM;While compression is a space saver for an operating system as large as V2R1,users still may never use all of V2's functions.andP;  Sheer size may be a drainon performance for smaller AS/400 models.andP;  According to Staff, &quot;It may not betrue in every case, but I have talked to users of smaller AS/400 systems whohave seen poorer performance because they have a larger operating system.andO;Performance is a complex formula and the operating system is just one of thevariables,&quot; Staff says, &quot;but some people feel that there might be aperformance hit if you go to V2 and keep the same hardware.&quot;andM;OUNCE OFandM;PREVENTIONandM;Since the April announcement, industry observers have not seen a rush toupgrade to V2.andP;  Currently, the logical candidates to upgrade from V1 to V2are users who plan an eventual upgrade to D model hardware.andM;According to Len Hutchinson, manager of the IBM Rochester Executive BriefingCenter (Rochester, Minn.), since the V2 operating system will run on theolder V1 hardware, the sequence in an upgrade to a D model from a B or Cmodel should be in two steps.andP;  &quot;If a user is going from V1 to V2 as part ofan upgrade to a D model, the first step would be to install V2 on the V1hardware -- the model B or C.andP;  The second step would be to install the V2hardware.&quot;andM;Judging by input he has received from customers, Staff also believes a futurehardware upgrade is the primary reason for a move from V1 to V2.andP;  &quot;If a useralready has plans to go to a D model processor, the user will benefit byupgrading the software first and hardware later, so he or she won't have todo both at the same time.andP;  In my experience with upgrades, it is helpful tokeep each step as simple as possible.&quot;andM;According to Staff, the actual operating system uprgrade process may takeabout eight hours, depending on the size of the machine.andP;  &quot;It's notdifficult, just time consuming,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;IBM has good instructions.andP;  Itmainly requires changing tapes, diskettes and cartridges when the machinerequests it.andP;  The user will be unaware of any modification of objects orapplications software.&quot;andM;In the opinion of Eduardo Ross, director of Randamp;D at Amalgamated Software ofNorth America (Big Bear Lake, Calif.), many current users of V1R2 havedelayed an upgrade to V2 until the modifications to V2 that allow them tomove to the new version directly become available.andM;When a V1R2 user leapfrogs V1R3 to V2, he or she should be certain thatapplications software is compatible with the new operating system, he says.andO;&quot;A lot of our customers tell me they will not even think about R3, just godirectly to V2,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;But there may be third-party programs for V1 thatneed to be revised to run on the new operating system.andP;  In our case, we hadto make some adjustments in our software products to make them work with V2,but the adjustments were minor.&quot;andM;Ross continues, &quot;V2 users may have to get a new version or release for someapplications, or at least be certain that the version they have works withV2.andP;  Otherwise, after the migration, users may find half their applicationsdon't work.&quot;andM;AS/400 consultants and programmers agree that IBM has made the uprgrade arelatively simple task, provided a knowledgeable systems person or staff isavailable.andP;  Tom Davis, a consultant and DP Labs review editor, mentions threebasic, rule-of-thumb precautions.andP;  First, always make sure there is a backupof the operating system in case the installation doesn't take.andP;  &quot;It'simportant to start with a good save of the operating system in the event youhave a bad tape and can't get another one for day or two.&quot;andM;Second, be sure that user-made changes to file descriptions or defaults aredocumented, since IBM may change the structure of its internal files.andO;According to Davis, users occasionally write their own software to display anobject description or keep track of programs or files on the system.andP;  &quot;Theyforget that IBM has changed the file layouts in a new operating systemversion.andP;  If so, some programs will stop functioning due to a level check.andO;The system recognizes a file has changed, and the machine will prevent theprogram from running.andP;  It's better to find out in advance what has changed soyou can allow for it.&quot;andM;In addition, Davis says, &quot;IBM allows a user to change the default values ofoperating system commands.andP;  If someone changes the default values and writessoftware based on the changes, he or she should document the changes.andP;  In anew release, those original values may not still be there.&quot;andM;Finally, keep up with the Program Temporary Fix (PTF) patches.andP;  &quot;A PTF is areplacement for a program that doesn't function the way it should.andP;  With anew operating system, IBM will send, as the last tape to be installed, acumulative PTF package.andP;  If the package is not installed, a user could be introuble.andP;  With an operating system this complex, there are bound to be bugs,and consequently, lots of patches.&quot;andM;Despite the inconvenience, an upgrade to V2R1 shouldn't be difficult, Davisbelieves.andP;  And as a prerequisite for acquiring the added power of the D modelhardware, the move will be well worth it.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
