Two of the banks -- Security National Bank andamp; Trust Co. of Norman, Norman, Okla., and Bowie National Bank, Bowie, Texas -- are to reopen today as newly chartered institutions. The insured deposits of the third, American National Bank of Grand Junction, Grand Junction, Colo., have been transferred to another bank.    Security National, closed by the Comptroller of the Currency, will retain its name and will be jointly owned by First Commercial Corp., Little Rock, Ark., and Northwest Arkansas Bancshares Inc., Bentonville, Ark. Each holding company will have 50% ownership in the newly chartered bank.    The failed bank had assets of $204.5 million and held deposits of $174.4 million in 31,000 accounts. The new bank agreed to pay the FDIC an $811,002 purchase premium and to buy assets of the failed bank for $113.8 million.    The FDIC will advance the new bank $80.3 million and retain assets of the failed bank valued at $90.7 million.    Last year, 3% of Oklahoma's banks failed, the highest rate in the nation.    Bowie National, closed by the Comptroller, is to reopen today as Bowie State Bank, a newly chartered subsidiary of Montague Bancshares Inc., Weatherford, Texas. The failed bank had assets of $12.6 million and held deposits of $12.6 million in 2,900 accounts.    Bowie State agreed to pay the FDIC a $205,000 purchase premium and to buy assets of the failed bank for $11.5 million. The FDIC will advance $886,000 to Bowie State and retain Bowie National assets valued at $1.1 million.    Last year, 26 Texas banks failed, the highest number in any state.    The insured deposits of American National, which was closed by the Comptroller, will be available beginning today at Intrawest Bank of Grand Junction. The FDIC arranged the transfer because it received no bids for the failed bank.    American National had assets of $7.4 million and held $7.1 million in 1,300 deposit accounts, including $2,000 in four accounts that exceeded the federal deposit insurance limit of $100,000. The holders of those uninsured deposits will share the proceeds from the sale of the bank's assets proportionately with the FDIC.    Intrawest agreed to pay a $1,000 purchase premium to the FDIC and to buy American National assets for $5.4 million.    Seven banks failed in Colorado last year. </TEXT></DOC>
