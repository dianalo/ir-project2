This paper centers on the far zone (early time) planewave active approach to electrical prospecting. A case study of reefexploration on the eastern shelf of the Midland Basin is presented. Thedata from this controlled source electromagnetic (EM) survey are usedto simulate the response of a passive source magnetotelluric (MT) surveyand of a shallow controlled source integrated transient survey. The controlledsource approach to electrical surveying achieves an improved signal tonoise ratio as compared to passive source methods. Such improved dataallow greater resolution of the earth's electrical structure. By usingcontrolled sources in combination with &quot;state of the art&quot; multichannelrecording techniques, data collection with dense spatial sampling canbe achieved. This dense sampling affords a more detailed and a more credibleinterpretation. To be fully effective, electrical prospecting needs toincorporate as many methods as possible into the final interpretation.The need for further development of these methods is discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
