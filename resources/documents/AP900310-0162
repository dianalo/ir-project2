Life sometimes imitates art. With circulation down andpublication schedules scaled back at the 20-year-old humor andsatire magazine, National Lampoon executives decided it was time tolet loose.   This month, National Lampoon is spending $500,000 to promote arevamped look to the college spring break crowd in Daytona Beach.The campaign will include billboards, sports contests, bikinicompetitions and, of course, a toga bash.   ``We're going to the college students and saying, `Take a lookat our magazine. We think you'll like it,''' said Michael Carr, aformer advertising director at Playboy hired last year as publisherof New York-based National Lampoon.   The April issue already shows the new direction of the magazine,which built its reputation in the 1970s on locker room-levelguffaws and a sardonic eye.   For the first time in many years, there is no nudity in themagazine. But it still contains many male-oriented sex jokes, aNational Lampoon staple.   Plans include improved graphics, more short fiction, articles oncomedians and humor and an emphasis on listings and tips. ``We wantto make it a guidebook to your funny bone,'' said Carr.   Carr said none of the spring break promotions will featurealcohol, which showers most other activities for the estimated400,000 college students expected in Daytona Beach this year.   ``The days of the Fort Lauderdale-party-till-you-puke mentalityis gone,'' said Carr. ``We want the kids to go home with goodmemories of spring break.''   ``Spring break is a marketing paradise,'' said James Spanfeller,associate publisher of Playboy magazine, which was launching itsown three-week Daytona Beach promotions.   The 1980s was a boom-time for comedy clubs and films, but theyuppie era was tough for National Lampoon, an outgrowth of TheHarvard Lampoon in Cambridge, Mass.   Circulation, which peaked at nearly 850,000 in 1974, fell to230,000 before a slight rebound last year. In 1986, the magazinestarted publishing every two months, but Carr said monthlypublication will resume with the 20th anniversary issue in October.   Media analysts say part of the magazine's decline stemmed fromits failure to keep pace with the growing sophistication andchanging tastes of its readership _ defined by Carr as 80 percentmale, about 28 years old, college-educated and earning $36,000 ayear.   ``A magazine must continually invigorate to bring in a newaudience,'' said Hollywood, Calif-based producer Daniel Grodnik,who purchased National Lampoon Inc. last year. His partner in theventure is actor Tim Matheson, who played the character Otter in``Animal House.''   On Friday, Grodnik and Matheson announced they had agreed tosell the company to J2, a home-video producer and distributor, inan exchange of stock valued at $4.67 million. Both will continue torun the company as a division of J2, which will provide additionalcapital for the magazine.   The two investors hired Carr, several new writers and BillyKimball, who edited The Harvard Lampoon's 1981 parody of Peoplemagazine.   Carr says advertisers already have begun to respond to theshake-up. In its February issue, the 112-page National Lampoon hadsix pages of advertising. The 96-page April issue, which sells for$3.95, has 40 pages of ads, including big-budget companies such asMolson Beer, R.J. Reynolds and Playboy.   In 1988, the most recent financial reports available, NationalLampoon Inc. reported revenue of about $5 million, slightly downfrom 1987. But the report does not include the third of NationalLampoon's ``vacation'' films, ``Christmas Vacation,'' which grossedmore than $75 million at the box office following its late 1989release.   ``If the Lampoon will tone itself down and have thatsophisticated look and content to match, advertisers will put theirlabel on it,'' said Paul DuCharme, head of print advertising atGrey Advertising.   But analysts note that other publications are competing for thechuckles of U.S. readers.   Four-year-old Spy magazine, which often satirizes modern urbanculture, announced last month it is seeking either a buyer orcash-rich investors for expansion. Time Warner Inc.'s 38-year-oldMad magazine focuses on a school-age crowd and reports a growingcirculation of about 1.4 million worldwide.   Problems, however, may loom for publications that cater to amostly male readership, said David Orlow, chairman of PeriodicalStudies Service Inc. in New York.   ``That usually means a lot of cigarette and alcohol ads,'' hesaid. ``The way things are going with public attitudes, it appearsthat type of advertising is on the decline.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Monday March 12</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
