For the two weeks ended last Friday, an unusual nine seats changed hands, compared with the usual one or two. The latest two sales were Friday, for $210,000 and later in the day for $214,000. Seats are currently quoted at $210,000 bid, $225,000 offered.    Nymex has always had a high turnover rate among traders, about 100 a year. But officials say available seats are at a particular premium now because of the number of oil companies and local brokerage houses that have recently sought memberships.    Volatile oil prices have also made seats more valuable, because it means there's more trading going on. Indeed, traders say Nymex's major markets -- crude oil, heating oil, gasoline and platinum, with natural gas expected to debut late this year -- have almost unlimited volatility potential. In 1987, Nymex volume increased 74% from the previous year, to a record 25.7 million contracts traded. And this year's trading has been running 53% ahead of 1987's pace, the exchange said. </TEXT></DOC>
