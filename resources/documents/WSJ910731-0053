The Benton Harbor, Mich., maker of home appliances postednet income of $58 million, or 83 cents a share, on sales thatincreased a modest 3.5%, to $1.72 billion. In theyear-earlier period, Whirlpool earned $37 million, or 54cents a share, on sales of $1.66 billion.</LP><TEXT>   The earnings performance, which the company characterizedas &quot;strong,&quot; surpassed analysts' projections -- many hadexpected per-share earnings of about 43 cents -- mainlybecause the Brazil operations had been expected to generate aloss. Whirlpool shares were quoted at $34.875, up $2.50, inlate trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume washeavy.   Whirlpool attributed its turnaround in Brazil to thatnation's reinstatement of a previously suspended regulationthat allowed the company to index nonmonetary assets, such asplants and equipment, for inflation. A Whirlpool spokesmansaid the rule &quot;creates higher depreciation expenses and makesfor a reduction in deferred taxes, which manifests itself tothe company as equity earnings.&quot;   The Brazilian operations, which consist of three appliancecompanies, earned $9 million, compared with a loss of $6.2million in the year-earlier quarter and a loss of $17 millionin this year's first quarter. The company hadn't had a profitfrom Brazil since the third quarter of 1990.   Despite equity earnings from its Brazilian affiliates, thecompany said it remains &quot;cautious&quot; regarding the operation'sfuture performance. &quot;While inflation in the country has, atpresent, moderated and some restrictions on the imporation ofmaterials have been eased, Brazil's short-term economicfuture remains uncertain,&quot; said Chairman David R. Whitwam.   Whirlpool also attributed the strong results to the&quot;bottom-line impact&quot; of a series of companywide moves toreduce costs, improve productivity and lower working-capitalneeds. These actions include manufacturing consolidations andwork force reductions.   Mr. Whitwam maintains that the company's improvement isn'tbased on &quot;one-time, short-term gains,&quot; but fundamentalchanges in the way it manages its business. Whirlpool saidinventory levels at the end of the latest quarter were down24% from those of the year-earlier period. The company hasalso cut the number of distribution centers in Europe to 18from 28.   Whirlpool added that it has been successful in gainingU.S. market share, despite a &quot;further slump in the NorthAmerican marketplace&quot; and &quot;relatively flat&quot; European demand.   Whirlpool said its own shipments are &quot;off, but markedlyless&quot; than the about 6% drop in shipments the overall U.S.industry endured. Although the company expects industryshipments to improve in the second half, Whirlpool said itexpects North American industry shipments in 1991 to finishdown about 5% from 1990 levels.   As if to underscore the point, Moody's Investors ServiceInc., which recently put Whirlpool's debt under review forpossible downgrade, yesterday marked down $874 million of thecompany's long-term debt. Moody's cited the &quot;weak returns in{Whirlpool's} core appliance business, which have erodedinterest coverage and discretionary cash flow, and thecontinuing poor operating environment.&quot; And it said&quot;prospects for a near-term rebound in appliance earnings arepoor.&quot;   The rating concern marked down the company's senior debtto single-A-3 from single-A-2, its subordinated debt to Baa-1from single-A-3, and its commercial paper to Prime-2 fromPrime-1.   Whirlpool said in its release yesterday that it considersthe company well positioned for &quot;anticipated North Americanmarket recovery and long-term European growth.&quot;   The company's results weren't affected by its plan to pay$610 million today to buy partner Philips Electronics N.V.'s47% stake in a European joint venture.</TEXT></DOC>
