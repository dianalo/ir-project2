VERNACI</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy pronounced George Bush a ``dead duck'' inthe presidential race, even as the vice president's campaignmanager and former GOP rivals said Saturday they weren't alarmed byhis weakness in the polls.   Bush campaign manager Lee Atwater said he is not worried yetabout Democrat Michael Dukakis' lead in the polls, saying Bush``operates better in the underdog position.   ``He enjoys it more,'' Atwater said. ``I don't care if we'rebehind. We may be behind all along.''   Bush and Dukakis, both of whom are assured of winning theirparties' presidential nominations this summer, stayed close to homeSaturday. The vice president took the day off in Houston, while theMassachusetts governor was in Boston for his home state'sDemocratic convention.   Democrat Jesse Jackson also kept to home turf Saturday with anhour-long speech in Chicago to supporters at Operation PUSH, thecivil rights group he founded. Jackson repeated his claim he shouldbe offered the No. 2 spot on the Democratic ticket and said hewould continue gathering delegates to force the party to accept hisissues as part of its platform.   ``We're going to Atlanta with the ability to help shape theplatform,'' Jackson said. ``Jesse is working on solidifying theRainbow Coalition movement and unifying the Democratic Party.''   Atwater was attending a ``Unity '88'' conference in Denver,where party leaders from Western states heard Bush's vanquished GOPrivals urge them to help defeat Dukakis.   ``It is not for the vice president to win this election byhimself,'' Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole told the conference.``The task is too large, the stakes are too high and the oppositiontoo bitter.''   Dole, the winner of the Republican caucuses in Iowa, said he hasbeen wary of polls since his own loss to Bush in the New Hampshireprimary.   When he looks at the Dukakis poll numbers, Dole said, ``I thinkof New Hampshire, and I think of my pollster. God bless his soul.''   ``I remember coming into the hotel one day, whistling `Hail tothe chief,' but I was the only one there,''' Dole said.   But Massachusetts Democrats were crowing about the politicalstrength their home-state candidate was showing in the publicopinion polls, some of which have Dukakis leading Bush by as manyas 15 percentage points.   ``President Dukakis, it has a nice ring, doesn't it?'' Kennedysaid in his speech to the state convention.   ``Some people say don't count your chickens before they'rehatched,'' Kennedy said. ``Well, I say the Republicans have alreadyhatched their chicken in this campaign _ and George Bush is a deadduck.''   ``You have made me what I am, and I am eternally grateful,''Dukakis told his state convention. ``Nobody has been blessed morethan I.''   But Dukakis, who has been criticized for a lack of experience inforeign policy, was taking heat Saturday for his suggestion earlierin the week that the United States should move its embassy inIsrael from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.   Israel declared its capital to be Jerusalem after seizing theeastern part of the city from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war,but the United States and most other nations continue to keep theirembassies in Tel Aviv.   Dukakis said U.S. embassies should be placed ``where the hostnation says its capital is.''   Dukakis was quickly criticized by Secretary of State George P.Shultz, and on Saturday, Arab League spokesman Clovis Maksoud saidif the governor was indicating the course of his foreign policy``then the U.S.'s future role in assisting to bring about a justpeace in the Middle East will further erode and will be seriouslyjeopardized.''   And Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek dismissed Dukakis' statement asjust election-year rhetoric.   ``It happens every time,'' Kollek said Saturday on Israeliradio. ``Jerusalem is a controversial issue, and thereforeeverybody will try to exploit this in order to attract votes.''   Meanwhile, Democrats drafting the party's platform clashed overwhether to include a call for raising taxes on the rich. Theproposed plank is backed by Jackson's supporters and opposed by theDukakis forces, who want to keep talk of raising taxes out of theparty platform.   Michael Barnes, Dukakis's top emissary to the platformcommittee, said ``The Democratic platform in 1988 is not going tocall for a tax increase.''   ``There's no question we're going to prevail,'' said Barnes, aformer Maryland congressman. ``Bruce Babbitt is a great guy, but hedidn't win the nomination.'' Babbitt had said he would raise taxes.   The drafting committee would hold its third and final day ofmeetings Sunday on Mackinac Island, a posh resort nestled betweenMichigan's upper and lower peninsulas.   Also on Saturday, former Vice President Walter Mondale, theDemocrats' 1984 presidential nominee, announced his endorsement ofDukakis, praising him as a ``brilliant, gifted public servantblessed with a sense of compassion.''   In a letter to the Minnesota Democratic convention, Mondale saidDukakis ``is the person who can bring our party together and wage astrong campaign based on our shared Democratic values.''</TEXT></DOC>
