Ray Mabus said.   ``You've got to start with early childhood education; you've gotto work on things such as life goals, self esteem, hope for thefuture,'' he said. ``You've got to involve the community, you'vegot to involve the parents, you've got to involve the boys as wellas the girls.''   Mabus co-chairs the Southern Strategic Planning Group onAdolescent Pregnancy Prevention, created a year ago by the SouthernGovernors' Association and the Southern Legislative Conference.   The report proposes a detailed blueprint for government,business, church and civic leaders.   ``Adolescents are more likely to get pregnant if they don't havehigh expectations, don't think they will finish their education,don't think there's a good job waiting, don't think their lifeholds a lot for them,'' Mabus said.   The panel proposed teaching life skills at the earliest possibleage through state and federal funding of early childhood educationprograms; family curricula starting in kindergarten; corporateincentives to keep kids in school; expanded public and privateefforts to improve jobs; help for adults who want to be betterparents; and better health care for young people.   The report said 47 percent of the 178,000 births to U.S. girlsunder age 17 in 1985 occurred in 17 Southern states, even thoughonly 37 percent of girls under 17 live in the region. Among girlsunder 17 with second or higher order births that year, 49 percentwere in the South.   New statistics gathered for the Southern Regional Project onInfant Mortality show that Georgia led the region in 1987 with29.62 pregnancies for every 1,000 girls between the ages of 10 and17.   North Carolina was second, with an adolescent pregnancy rate of29.42, followed by South Carolina at 27.76, Mississippi at 26.92,Arkansas at 26.02, Tennessee at 25.32, Alabama at 25.27, Virginiaat 25.18, Maryland at 25.41 and Missouri at 21.20.   In six of those 10 states, the adolescent pregnancy rate washigher in 1987 then in 1986, indicating that the decade-long trendof slowly declining adolescent pregnancy rates in the South may bereversing.</TEXT></DOC>
