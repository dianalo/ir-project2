Also proposed: 200 Abrams tanks, seven multiple-launchedbattlefield rocket systems and 1,500 Tow anti-tank missiles forKuwait; 40 Maverick air-to-ground missiles with an infra-redguidance system and electronic warfare gear for Bahrain; 24 F-16 jetfighters, 100 Mavericks and 100 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles forMorocco, and seven of the battlefield rocket systems for SaudiArabia.   Greece would get 60 M48 tanks and 100 Harpoon anti-ship missilesfor Greece.   If Bush follows through, the proposed Arab sales would seem sureto touch off a battle with congressional supporters of Israel, whichis concerned that sophisticated weapons in Arab hands could beturned against Israel in a Mideast conflict.   The list is classified; a copy was obtained by The AssociatedPress.   Charles E. Redman, the State Department spokesman, declined toidentify the weapons under consideration for sale. He stressed thatthe document did not amount to a ``sale plan,'' but rather to theadministration's ``best estimate'' of other countries' weapons needs.   ``Each item has to be reviewed by this administration,'' Redmansaid.   Congress has the power to block a purchase, but only if amajority of both the Senate and the House reject a formal WhiteHouse notification of intended sale.   The informal list was sent to Congress on Jan. 19 by the outgoingReagan administration. The Bush administration opened talks withCongress last Friday, said a U.S. official who declined to beidentified.   Currently, the United States only shares the Abrams tank, alsoknown as the M1A1, only with Egypt. The two nations have aco-production agreement, but the proposed sale would mean the tankswould be sold to nations other than Egypt.   Under the plan now under discussion, Egypt would be sold 150 Hawkmissiles, 24 helicopters, artillery radar and tank equipment. Israelwould be sold 200 shoulder-fired Stinger missiles, 24 helicoptersand new equipment for its F-15 jet fighters.   Jordan again would receive no American weapons. Since 1985,Congress has prohibited militry aid to the Arab kingdon until itagrees to peace terms with Israel.   Meanwhile, the sources said that the White House, in a coverletter, told Congress that the Saudis are now deciding whether torequest U.S. or European fighters to replace over the coming decadetheir aging fleet of U.S.-made F-5s.   The letter said the Saudis were considering jets to be jointlyproduced by Britain and West Germany along with the French Mirage4000 and U.S.-built F-16s and FA-18s.</TEXT></DOC>
