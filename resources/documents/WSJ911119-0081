Routinely criticized by big-time newspaper and magazineeditors as lightweight editorial products, AdvancePublications Inc.'s Parade and Gannett Co.'s USA Weekend canafford to sneer at detractors. Despite a national advertisingrecession, both Parade and, to a lesser extent USA Weekend,are getting a big lift from direct response, or mail-orderadvertising, one of only two top national ad categories thatare showing growth.</LP><TEXT>   For the first time ever, Parade is expected to finish theyear with more gross advertising dollars than any other U.S.magazine. At the same time, the number of newspapers carryingthe magazines has steadily grown, with Parade carried by 339papers with a combined circulation of 36 million, and USAWeekend inserted in 343 papers reaching 16.5 million readers.   Though Parade ranks low among major consumer magazines intotal ad pages, it charges the most expensive rate in all ofprint media: $460,000 for a single color page. For the first10 months, Parade's ad revenue totaled $318 million, wellahead of such perennial heavyweights as Time and TV Guide.Through October, Parade's ad pages were up 4.5%; USAWeekend's were up 1% for the same period (though ad revenueis up 17%). Gannett expects USA Weekend to finish the year atleast flat in ad pages, a claim few consumer magazinepublishers are able to make.   In large part, the newspaper industry's troubles havefueled the Sunday supplements' gains. With the collapse oflocal retail and department store ad spending, many papershave found it simply too expensive to produce their ownSunday magazines. Since the mid-1980s, at least 15 metroSunday magazines have folded, and those remaining have lostlarge amounts of advertising. Even the highly regarded SundayNew York Times Magazine was off 25% in ad pages throughOctober.   A growing number of publishers have followed the exampleof Times Mirror Co.'s Newsday, which last spring folded itsNewsday Magazine, saving more than $1 million a year. For afar lower cost, Newsday then started to carry Parade. Otherpapers are simply keeping their local magazine but addingParade as a way to build circulation on Sundays, the one dayof the week on which newspaper readership is actuallygrowing.   As the undisputed leader in the Sunday magazine field,Parade's editorial product is decidedly upbeat, with frequentinspirational cover stories on the handicapped and coverlines such as &quot;What America Eats&quot; and &quot;To Give Freedom AVoice.&quot;   &quot;Why can't people have something good to read on Sundaymorning?&quot; asks Parade publisher Carlo Vittorini, pointing tostories that have resulted in spontaneous contributions fromreaders.   For many newspaper executives, Parade's brand ofjournalism is seen as its strength. &quot;The bad news aboutParade is the good news: it's light,&quot; says Robert Johnson,publisher and chief executive of New York Newsday. &quot;It iswritten to reach the broadest common denominator in America.We save the hefty investigative pieces that would have beenin our magazine for pages of our Sunday paper.&quot;   USA Weekend, meanwhile, wins high marks from publisherswho carry it for its appeal to younger audiences. WilliamDean Singleton, vice chairman of MediaNews Group, says hecarries USA Weekend in almost all the papers he owns, such asthe Houston Post and Denver Post. &quot;Older readers generallylike Parade and younger ones are drawn to USA Weekend becauseit has more helpful-hint type of articles,&quot; Mr. Singletonsays. &quot;Newspapers are desperately trying to draw youngreaders. USA Weekend is more on the cutting edge.&quot;   Cutting edge, in this case, is a relative term. USAWeekend is not as fond of tearjerking covers as Parade,instead going for communal events, such as featuring MagicJohnson (before the news of his retirement) on the cover forthe start of the basketball season. USA Weekend covers areoften keyed to what a young family can do with their kids.&quot;We target the baby boomers with how-to articles,&quot; saysBrette Popper, publisher of USA Weekend. &quot;We can keep theyounger reader in the paper.&quot;   Both Parade and USA Weekend in the past relied heavily oncigarette advertising. Parade's Mr. Vittorini says that in1979, Parade carried more than 350 pages of cigarette ads;this year, Parade will carry 50 such pages at most. The slackhas been picked up by the mail-order houses such asknick-knack purveyor Franklin Mint, record club ColumbiaHouse, and retailer Wal Mart. All have increased theirspending as the mass-market Sunday magazines have expandedtheir readership to almost TV-size audiences.   Franklin Mint, once an infrequent advertiser, recentlysigned a two-year contract to run almost every week inParade, says Mr. Vittorini. USA Weekend is making inroadswith the big-spending packaged goods advertisers, recentlyselling special ad sections to Eureka vacuums and Proctor andamp;Gamble.   Expensive as advertising in Parade may be (USA Weekend ispricey too at $225,000 for a page), advertisers will pay forads that move products, especially in a recession. Becausereaders spend more time with Sunday papers, advertisers knowtheir ad has a good chance of being read that day.   &quot;Parade gives you a fast, mass audience,&quot; says BethRockwood, executive vice president at Young andamp; Rubicam, whoseclient Holiday Inn ran ad pages in Parade last summer. ButMs. Rockwood also sounds a note of skepticism about Parade,which measures its audience by counting every reader of eachSunday newspaper that carries it. &quot;Not every Sunday reader isa Parade reader,&quot; says Ms. Rockwood. &quot;It's a concern, butthey can still justify their big audiences.&quot;   ---   Kraft Account to JWT                                                                                                          Kraft General Foods International reassigned some $50million in overseas coffee advertising to WPP Group's J.Walter Thompson, a move meant to &quot;involve them more in thepan-European picture,&quot; said a spokesman for the Philip MorrisCos. unit.   The moves could threaten the position of JWT sister agencyOgilvy andamp; Mather on the $90 million Maxwell House account,industry executives said, because they make JWT one ofKraft's &quot;core&quot; coffee agencies, in addition to Ogilvy andYoung andamp; Rubicam.   Ogilvy andamp; Mather declined to comment, but other executivesdisagreed, noting that Kraft had just assigned Ogilvy thenational advertising for its new Cappio iced coffee.Advertising for the brand in test marketing had been handledby Margeotes, Fertitta andamp; Weiss, New York.   The reassignments include the $40 million Jacobs brand inAustria, Germany and Switzerland, which was previouslyhandled by Saatchi andamp; Saatchi Co.'s German office. Inaddition, the $10 million Cafe Hag and Kenco accounts movefrom Young andamp; Rubicam to JWT in the U.K.   ---   McTelevision                                                                                                          McDonald's Corp. and Turner Broadcasting System Inc. saidthey had reached an agreement in principle to &quot;explore&quot;putting television sets with &quot;exclusive programming&quot; inMcDonald's 8,600 U.S. stores.   Test dates and locations for the advertiser-supportednetwork would be announced in the future, the companies saidin a prepared statement.   The project marks the third &quot;outof-home&quot; medium developedby Turner Private Networks. Turner's Checkout Channel will beintroduced by year end, and Airport Channel is expected todebut in six airports soon. The McDonald's network couldreach an audience of 18 million customers who eat atMcDonald's U.S. restaurants each day.   ---   Ad Notes. . . .
