Computer salespeople andtechnicians routinely tell users that, regrettably, themachines aren't &quot;compatible.&quot;   But such statements are, at best, gross exaggerations -- aclassic case of experts focusing on technical barriers ratherthan practical solutions. In many home and small-officesituations, it's easy to share data among IBM-compatibles andMacs without a network.   The Wall Street Journal office in which this column iswritten features an IBM-compatible and a Macintosh thatroutinely share files on floppy disks that are swappedbetween them. This column was begun on a Mac using Claris'sMacWrite II word processing program and finished on anIBM-compatible using XyQuest's XyWrite III Plus wordprocessing software.   No technical wizardry is needed to create such a setup --just modestly priced off-the-shelf software. Experts deridethis approach as &quot;sneaker net,&quot; because it can requirecarrying disks between computers -- but it works.   It is true that IBM-compatibles and Macintoshes usedifferent &quot;operating systems&quot; -- the special, underlyingsoftware needed to run the machines -- that prevent them fromrunning the same software programs. An IBM PC's operatingsystem software doesn't recognize a data disk formatted on aMac, and vice versa. Techies and salespeople focus on thisfact. But there are clever and inexpensive ways around thatbarrier.   This is a problem with three parts. First, can thecomputers' disk drives physically accommodate each other'sdisks? Second, can the two computers' operating systems betricked into recognizing disks produced on the other? Third,can your application programs -- word processors,spreadsheets and so on -- for one type of computer use filescreated on the other type of computer?   The hardware issue is the easiest one. Today, everyMacintosh comes out of the box with a 3 1/2-inch floppy diskdrive that can physically read disks from IBM-compatibles.Newer IBMs sport the same-sized drives, and adding suchdrives to older IBMs that lack them is inexpensive. Or, youcan buy a special disk drive that permits a Mac to read theolder style 5 1/4-inch IBM-type floppies.   But the computers' operating-system software must still bedeceived into recognizing each other's disks. Luckily, thereare at least three inexpensive (under $100 by mail order)Macintosh software programs that permanently fool the Mac'soperating system into recognizing IBM-formatted data disks.They are: Access PC, by Insignia Solutions; DOS Mounter, byDayna Communications; and Software Bridge/Mac, by ArgosySoftware. These programs need to be installed just once, andthen you can forget about them.   And there's a new utility program for IBM-compatibles thatpermits them to recognize disks from Macs. It's calledMac-to-DOS, from PLI. It isn't as automatic as the three Macutilities, but it does the job with minimal fuss.   So, you've got your computer to &quot;see&quot; the disks and filesfrom its alien cousin. How can your programs use the files?   For word processing documents, programs on both computerscan usually save files as plain text, a universal format thatincludes all the words but excludes special formatting suchas underlining and italics. Just save a file on one computeras &quot;text&quot; or &quot;ASCII&quot; (its technical name), pop the disk intothe other machine, and most word processors will be able tocall it up.   Spreadsheet files can also be saved in universal formats.A common one is the Lotus 1-2-3 format, which mostspreadsheet programs on both types of computers recognize.Graphics files can also be translated into a common formatusable by many programs.   An even better approach is to equip your IBM-compatibleand Mac with compatible versions of the same software. Thatusually allows you to swap files between the machines whilepreserving all of your special formatting and formulas.   Many major business programs are now available in such&quot;twin&quot; versions for IBMs and Macs. They include the MicrosoftWord writing program and Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, theWordPerfect word processor, the Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet andAldus PageMaker desktop publishing program.   There are also special utility programs designed solely totranslate files from one computer to the other. Applesupplies such a program, Apple File Exchange, free with allMacs, and there are commercial offerings, such as MacLinkPlus by DataViz and Argosy's Software Bridge/Mac, whichtranslates files automatically as soon as they're opened.   In future columns, we'll discuss costlier ways tointegrate Macs and IBM-compatibles. These include networks,transferring files over phone lines, and special software andhardware that permit the machines to run programs written foreach other. These solutions may make the best sense for largeoffices constantly sharing lots of files. But for smallershops, remember this: No matter what the experts say, you canshare work between dissimilar computers without a lot ofhassle or expense.</TEXT></DOC>
