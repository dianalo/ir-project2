This condition is caused by changes in filterloading as particulate accumulates over time.Environmental Impacts of the Proposed ActionThe Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed revision toTS and finds that the resulting value of the iodine protection factor (IPF)for use in the radiological dose calculations for control room personnelis not decreased significantly with the proposed increase in flow variationsand lower control room pressurization in comparison to the IPF withoutthese changes. The staff has also calculated the potential radiation dosesto control room operators following a design basis accident and finds themto be within the acceptance criteria of General Design Criterion 19 andStandard Review Plan Section 6.4. Therefore, the proposed changes do notincrease the probability of consequences of accidents, no changes are beingmade in the types of any effluents that may be released offsite, and thereis no significant increase in the allowable individual or cumulative occupationalradiation exposure. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that this proposedaction would result in no significant radiological environmental impact.The Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment and Opportunity forPrior Hearing in connection with this action was published in the<T4> Federal Register</T4> on May 20, 1988 (53 FR 18187). No request forhearing or petition for leave to intervene was filed following this notice.With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed change tothe TS involves systems located within the restricted area as defined by10 CFR Part 20. It does not affect nonradiological plant effluents andhas no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludesthat there are no significant nonradiological environmental impacts associatedwith the proposed amendment.Alternative to the Proposed ActionSince the Commission concluded that there are no significant environmentaleffects that would result from the proposed action, any alternatives withequal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated.The principal alternative would be to deny the requested amendment. Thiswould not reduce environmental impacts of plant operation and would resultin reduced operational flexibility.Alternative Use of ResourcesThis action does not involve the use of any resources not previously consideredin the Final Environmental Statement for the Callaway Plant dated January1982.Agencies and Persons ConsultedThe NRC staff reviewed the licensee's request and did not consult otheragencies or persons.<ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of No Significant Impact</ITAG>The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statementfor the proposed license amendment.Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, we conclude that theproposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality of thehuman environment.For further details with respect to this action, see the application foramendment dated March 25, 1988 and supplements dated December 28, 1988and March 31, 1989, which are available for public inspection at the Commission'sPublic Document Room, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC and at the CallawayCounty Public Library, 710 Court Street, Fulton, Missouri 65251 and theJohn M.
