Solidarity candidates won a decisive majority in the new100-member Polish Senate and virtually all of the 161 seatsavailable to the opposition in the 460-seat legislative Sejm,according to unofficial results of Sunday's balloting.   Bush applauded the results and said, ``I am encouraged by theresponses of both the Polish government and members of theopposition.''   ``The Polish people are now taking steps that deserve our activesupport. We will work in concert with our allies to help Polishdemocracy take root anew and sustain itself,'' Bush said.   The State Department also applauded the outcome, departing fromits normal policy of not taking sides in foreign elections bycalling the results ``victory for all Poles.''   The United States normally expresses support for electoralprocesses in foreign countries without taking sides among competingparties.   While praising the concession statement by Poland's CommunistParty, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Tuesday,``The U.S. regards Solidarity's apparent victory as a victory forall Poles.''   A State Department official, insisting on anonymity, admitted theofficial position prepared for the daily press briefing was notproperly phrased.   ``We had no intention of taking sides,'' the official said. ``Weshould have tightened up the language.''   The official said he did not believe a retraction would be issuedsince only one reporter had asked about the statement.   Another official expressed no misgivings about the statement,saying, ``We feel Solidarity better represents the people of Polandthan the other fellows (the communists).''</TEXT></DOC>
