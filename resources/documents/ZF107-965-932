 The Mississauga, Ontariocompany provides design, production and project management services for theconstruction of a nuclear power plant.andM;Until 1986, Candu used IBM's PMS4 project management software linked to theparent company's mainframe in Ottawa.andP;  A corporate restructuring in 1986 gaveDavid Harrington, Candu's director of project management systems, theopportunity to choose a new system.andM;&quot;We purchased a VAX-based platform that is clustered with our existing VAXesand compatible with our CAD and business management systems,&quot; Harringtonsaid.andM;The software Candu selected is Project Software and Development Inc.'s(PSDI's) Project/2 project management software and Oracle's relationaldatabase management system.andP;  The four-user Project/2 license supports fourmajor projects and 15 smaller projects.andM;The savings were apparent almost immediately, Harrington said.andP;  The companysaved about $500,000 annually by eliminating the need for corporate MIS tosupport the mainframe.andP;  With the first year's savings, the company purchaseda VAX 8700.andM;Candu is saving even more by making long-term strategic use of projectmanagement software and methodologies.andP;  The company recently completedconstruction of the Wolsong-1 nuclear plant in South Korea, in just 56months--16 months earlier than they had projected.andM;&quot;We got dividends within six months of our investment in software andhardware, and we paid off that investment in two years,&quot; Harrington said.andO;&quot;It's not easy and it's not cheap to get started.andP;  But we couldn't afford notto do it.&quot;andM;Candu has linked Project/2 and Oracle with its own document control system,including a CAD system running on a VAX 8700 that handles virtually alldesigns and drawings for the Candu-3 nuclear plant.andM;&quot;We took planning and scheduling functions and integrated them with costcontrol using Project/2.andP;  Then we took the original batch Cobol-baseddocumentation control, rewrote it in SQL for Oracle and linked it via theschedule function to Project/2,&quot; he explained.andP;  &quot;This means no more duplicatedata entry, because the information can be automatically transferred throughOracle.andM;&quot;Data entry used to require about 50 percent of the time of 100 terminals,with 10 percent being duplicate data entry.andP;  Now we save five work-yearsannually,&quot; he said.andM;High-level support can be critical in enabling companies that are new toproject management software reaize return on investment quickly, as managersat ABB Robotics discovered.andP;  ABB, a New Berlin, Wis.-based manufacturer ofindustrial robots, realized a return on its $47,500 investment in just sevenmonths.andM;Dick Titus, ABB's manager of operations planning and standard product, saidABB needed to improve communications both internally and externally and tomanage resources more efficiently.andM;&quot;Senior executives gave us the support we needed to choose and implementproject management and project management software,&quot; he said.andM;With the new system, ABB has won a number of contracts, including a $7million contract and several smaller ones ranging from $300,000 to $500,000.andM;It took only seven months from the time of purchase for the company to recoupits investment in T and B Computing's TrackStar software plus training, Titussaid.andM;ABB Robotics averages, 50 short- and long-term projects in progress at anyone time.andP;  Many of these projects are in the proposal stage, whenclarification of commitments, scheduling, and allocation of resources iscrucial.andM;Before January 1989, &quot;Everyone was managing projects and information in theirown ways.andP;  Some people were even using handwritten notes or keeping all oftheir information to themselves,&quot; Titus said.andM;ABB senior executives chartered a task force to conduct an extensive searchof project management software packages.andP;  This task force set up a list ofbasic criteria, then hired a consultant to help select the package.andM;The selection was TrackStar, which has a menu-driven system that the taskforce found easiest to use.andM;The company uses TrackStar on a VAXstation 3100 in New Berlin, linked toVT240s for graphics and also to VT220s and PCs.andP;  This hardware is connectedvia leased lines to a VAX 11/780 and to two MicroVAX systems at a neighboringfacility in New Berlin.andP;  The company paid $35,000 for an unlimited TrackStarlicense, $7,200 for training and $5,250 for an extended warranty.andM;&quot;The easy part for use was getting the software.andP;  The hard part was gettingeverybody to use it correctly,&quot; Titus said.andM;Key personnel took part in T and B's basic two-day training session, whichcovers project management methodology as well as use of the TrackStarsoftware.andP;  Upon their return, the trained personnel conducted in-housesessions.andM;ESCA of Bellevue, Wash., a leading developer of energy management systems forutility companies, found out the hard way about the need for training.andP;  The250-employee company ran into trouble when it began using PC-based projectmanagement software, PSDI's Qwiknet Professional, to manage a large,long-term contract for Consolidated Edison of New York.andM;&quot;When we first purchased Qwiknet, I tried to use it to manage a three-year,$10 million project for Con Edison,&quot; said Denise Fuentes, manager of projectadministration for ESCA.andP;  &quot;But there wasn't time to get training, so we weretrying to learn and do simultaneously.&quot;andM;The problem with that approach was apparent immediately: &quot;When I made myfirst presentation to the client, some dates weren't right, and theactivities weren't well-organized,&quot; she said.andP;  &quot;The client knew we werespending most of our time entering data, not analyzing information, andsuggested we invest time in learning how to use the project management tool.&quot;andM;Fuentes accepted the suggestion.andP;  She and another ESCA employee went to abasic three-day training session at a nearby PSDI office and learned thefundamentals of using the project management software.andM;It was worth $1,200 investment, Fuentes said.andP;  &quot;Now we have a good grasp ofthe tool and the scheduling capabilities.&quot;andM;The company has since replaced its PC version of Qwiknet with the VAXversion, Qwiknet Professional.andP;  The price for the four-user license for a VAX8530 was $18,900, which included some training.andM;Fuentes said the upgrade was necessary because even though ESCA's four usershad Qwiknet on their PCs, they found it difficult to maintain a standard forreports.andP;  Consequently, managers had problems comparing schedules betweenprojects.andM;Weekly reports can now be produced in one-fourth of the time previouslyneeded, she said.andP;  Yearly savings in administrative costs are approximately$500 per project.andP;  And although the initial time investment to enter costestimates remains the same, the savings in time spent updating information isconsiderable.andP;  Fuentes estimates that with project management software, ESCAwill save 160 hours per year and $2,000 per project in maintenance andmonthly report production costs.andM;In Florida, where state agencies have been under the gun to begin planningfor the state's explosive population growth, project management is playing asignificant role.andM;&quot;The Growth Management Act requires Florida governmental entities to developthe infrastructure and plans necessary to support the state's growingpopulation,&quot; said Tom Conrecode, project management director for the Officeof Capital Projects Management in Collier County.andM;Working with Darryl Lanoue, also a project manager for Collier County,Conrecode selected Primavera Systems Primavera project management software.andM;&quot;The major packages we looked at provided the same scheduling and costtracking capabilities.andP;  We chose Primavera because it is interactive andfairly easy to learn.andP;  Also, a large number of our engineering contractorsalready use it, so in the future it could easily allow us to transfer data,read their output and ask for specifics,&quot; Conrecode said.andM;An unlimited license for Primavera Project Planner, Primavision and Parade ispriced at $30,000.andP;  Also included in that price are installation,orientation, documentation, maintenance and telephone support for one year.andO;Maintenance renewal is priced at $5,400 per year.andM;The office already owned the VAX 6330 on which the software was installed,and bought eight VT340 Colortek graphics monitors with DEC's WPS keyboard at$2,000 each.andM;The office also spent $5,000 on training and six months to get users up tospeed and entering data.andM;&quot;We gave about 30 project managers a total of nine days training on projectmanagement and the scheduling/networking components of Primavera.andP;  Then theygot a two-day session on Parade, Primavera's performance measurementsoftware, which offers reporting capabilities for complex cost/schedulereporting,&quot; Conrecode said.andP;  &quot;Data entry people took a scaled-down, two-daycourse.&quot;andM;The office now uses Primavera to manage more than 150 construction andredevelopment projects, ranging in length from nine months to five years andcosting from $500,000 to several million dollars.andP;  Data entry was achallenge.andM;&quot;We were--and are--very concerned with the integrity of the reportingprocedures,&quot; Lanoue said.andP;  &quot;But we didn't understand what a large task itwould be until we got started.&quot;andM;But with hard work, the office published its first summary-level report onall projects in October.andM;&quot;By summarizing all of our projects in one report, we're getting a bigpicture of what has to be done in the next five years,&quot; Conrecode said.andM;&quot;We're still coming up to speed on the software, still working out bugs, andhave just now accumulated our baseline of information,&quot; Lanoue said.andP;  &quot;[But]most of all, we're finding we should have implemented this three years ago.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
