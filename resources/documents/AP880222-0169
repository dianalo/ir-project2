The pay increases were below the average 5.7 percent raisesreceived by state and local government employees in 1986. But theworkers still fared better last year than federal employees who gota 3 percent pay increase and private sector workers whose wagesrose an average 3.3 percent.   However, the Bureau of Labor Statistics noted that unioncontracts in the public and private sectors differ significantly.   State and local governments, for example, tend to have a higherproportion of professional and white-collar workers. Unioncontracts in the private sector, on the other hand, often includelump-sum bonuses and cost-of-living adjustments excluded from thewage calculations and usually absent in the public sector.   The figures showed that local government workers with wageincreases averaging 5.3 percent outpaced state employees workerswith an average 4.3 percent raise.   Among occupation groups, primary and secondary school teachersgot the biggest raises at 6.3 percent, followed by transit andother transportation workers at 4.8 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
