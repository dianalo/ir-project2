Bruh, director of Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network(FinCEN), said analysts on his staff can help law enforcement agencies detectunusual or illegal transactions and then develop a strategy for catching andprosecuting criminals.andM;&quot;Most criminal acts are committed for profits, and we can pull togetherinformation from various sources and combine information sitting in differentdatabases to prove criminal activity,&quot; Bruh said.andP;  &quot;We can now prove thecrime of narcotics trafficking because financial databases show large,unexpected amounts of cash being moved.&quot;andM;FinCEN, which began operating in April, will assist all federal, state andlocal law enforcement agencies.andP;  Bruh said his staff consists of 200investigators, research analysts and auditors on loan from other agenciesincluding the Justice Department, Drug Enforcement Administration, FBI andFederal Reserve Board.andM;The network still is being developed, but users can check different Treasurysystems such as the Treasury Enforcement Communications System II andConsolidated Data Network for investigative case reports, search warrants,financial statements and public records.andM;FinCEN has an IBM Token-Ring network with file servers that are IBM PS/2Model 80 311s.andP;  A 56-kilobit/sec line links the local area network's userswith the Customs Service's data center in Newington, Va.andM;Bruh said the network can perform up to 80 transactions or searches for 200users at a time.andM;For example, FinCEN analysts may examine currency transaction reports filedby banks, casinos and other financial institutions to determine whetherunusually large cash transfers point to a money laundering operation.andP;  TheInternal Revenue Service collects these reports.andM;The data is manipulated to identify anomalies that could be evidence of acrime.andP;  Bruh said FinCEN eliminates all the anomalies generated by legaltransactions.andP;  Analysts try to determine what crimes may have been committedas a result of the more suspicious actions.andM;Despite FinCEN's obvious benefits, Bruh said agencies are reluctant to sharetheir data.andP;  Bruh said FinCEN's analyses are kept confidential, but manyagencies are worried about network security and enter into access agreementsgrudgingly.andM;&quot;It's not an easy task, because agencies don't like giving up theirdatabases.andP;  We hope to sign up six law enforcement agencies in the next fewweeks, but it's still a matter of grinding it out,&quot; Bruh said.andP;  &quot;They want tomake sure we know what we're doing.&quot;andM;Bruh said the network also poses privacy concerns.andP;  To guard againstunauthorized access, he said, FinCEN accepts requests only from certifiedagency representatives and develops an extensive audit trail for each search.andM;&quot;There are lots of legal and policy questions.andP;  But we've narrowed it down toa limited number of people who can call in requests, and we are looking at anumber of encryption devices,&quot; Bruh said.andP;  &quot;We've limited the access toexternal databases.&quot;andM;Bruh said FinCEN eventually will operate a 24-hour communications centerwhere certified agencies can access the network via telephone.andP;  He said healso is looking at a software product used by the U.S.andP;  Geological Survey tosupport automatic database queries.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
