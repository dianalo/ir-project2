 Approximately200,00 landed immigrants become Canadian citizens, more than two millionpages of text are translated into either official language and hundreds ofminority or cultural groups receive grants or contributions.andM;In such a busy environment, reliable and current information supported byreliable computer systems is essential.andM;To help meet this need, the department has a $6-million Facilities Management(FM) contract with STM Systems Corp., a Toronto-based computing servicescompany, for a five-year term.andM;Facilities Management is a service in which STM provides everything clientsneed for their computing environment -- equipment, software, operations,support and communications -- all of which is managed on an ongoing basis.andM;The Department of the Secretary of State uses an IBM 3083J mainframeprocessor and a database management system from the Computer Corporation ofAmerica.andM;Said Ronald Desormeau, director general, informatics and administrativepolicies and services branch, Department of the Secretary of State:&quot;Facilities Management gave us more opportunities for redeployment ofin-house computer capability.andM;&quot;Because of this redeployment, we were able to save $4 million which hasallowed us to purchase microcomputers and computer-assisted design packageswhich were in demand in some operational areas.&quot;andM;The FM contract supports systems including the Canada Student Loans ProgramSystem, Canadian Citizenship Registration System, the Canadian OfficialLanguage Management Information System for tracking payments to minority andcultural groups, and the Operational Information System for trackingtranslation requests.andM;For the Canada Student Loans Program, the computer system tracks allpayments, calculates the interest relief on unpaid loans, monitors chequesissued to students by the federal government, handles on-line inquiries andso on.andP;  Moe than $2 million in loan payments is processed annually.andM;Official language translation activities are also a major part of the FMcontract.andP;  While 90 per cent of the work is translated from French to Englishand English to French, translation services are also available in 37 otherlanguages from Arabic to Urdu.andM;800 translatorsandM;The department, with 800 translators across Canada, translates texts for theHouse of Commons, the Department of National Defence, Transport Canada andall federal government departments including some agencies of the crown.andO;&quot;The Operational Information System for translation services tracks thequality and quantity of the language services provided and evaluatesproductivity,&quot; said Desormeaux.andM;&quot;The system will tell us if one area in the department is being inundatedwith request for translation services and will identify the special fieldrequired.andP;  We can then re-distribute the work more efficiently.&quot;andM;Programs for citizenship registration and minority and women's group fundingare also supported under the FM contract.andM;&quot;The citizenship registration program provides information on new citizensand landed immigrants who are applying for Canadian citizenship,&quot; saidDesormeaux.andP;  &quot;We supply citizenship courts -- there are 34 such courts inCanada -- with documentation to help judges grant Canadian citizenship statusto landed immigrants.&quot;andM;The major processing user group for this program is located in Sydney, NovaScotia, and is linked from Sydney to STM in Ottawa by dedicatedtelecommunication lines.andM;Documentation is also necessary for the Canadian Official Language ManagementInformation System, which helps track all information when awarding finalpayments to women's groups, minority groups including native, ethnic andcultural groups&quot; or to organizations that promote Canadian unity, nationalismor human rights,&quot; explained Desormeaux.andP;  &quot;We support hundreds of groups ororganizations annually.&quot;andM;The Secretary of State also has a contract with STM to provide data captureservices for the multimillion-dollar Canada Student Loans Program.andP;  More thanone million documents and applications are processed annually.andP;  According toDesormeaux, the equipment is really put to the test during crucial periodssuch as in September when parliament resumes and the House of Commons hasurgent needs for translation services.andM;Critical timesandM;Other critical times are in March and April when grants and applications forCanada Student Loans are received and renewed and in September and Decemberwhen loans are granted.andP;  Peaks also occur at other various times during theyear when landed immigrants are in the final stages of receiving citizenshipcertificates.andM;&quot;Documents are needed immediately and our clients rely on continuous supportfrom the Department of Secretary of State.&quot;andP;  And the department, in turn,counts on STM, added Desormeaux.andP;  &quot;They understand our critical systemrequirements and provide us with ongoing technical support.&quot;andM;Maurice Simms is senior writer with STM System corp. based on Toronto.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
