<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-44-0924 </DOCNO><TEXT>Chief among shearer operational problems identified by US Bureau of Minesare 1) the high percentage of machine down time due to vibrational wearand tear, 2) high cutting tool wear, especially when the shearer mustcut through rock rather than coal, 3) high proportion of product fines,4) unacceptable dust levels. Whilst greater power, precise control offace advance and automated steering are all contributing to greater productivity,optimal performance also requires that the shearer drum and cutting toolsare right for the job. Here are summarised just some of the recent advancesin the field of drum and cutter head technology, which minimise the aboveproblems. 1 fig.</TEXT></DOC>
