To someextent, algorithm performance can be evaluated analytically. Detailedanalysis, however, would be cumbersome, especially if many parameterswere involved. An alternative is the use of a hardware test-bed, whichwould allow hardware and architecture parameters to be directly implementedor efficiently emulated. A program at the NASA Lewis Research Center(an outgrowth of previous work on the Real-time Multiprocessor Simulator)is dedicated to studying the application of parallel processing to CFM/CSM.To facilitate both the investigation of algorithm-architecture interactionsand the evaluation of software, a reconfigurable hardware test-bed isbeing assembled. This article discusses this test-bed.</TEXT></DOC>
