Real economic growth will average 2.4% this year and 3% in 1988, based on information from 27 top financial executives polled by the nonprofit research institute.    Those surveyed said inflation would average less than 3% annually this year and next.    Vincent G. Massaro, a Conference Board senior economist, said panelists lowered inflation forecasts for the third consecutive year, but &quot;since past forecasts have tended to lag behind actual turning points in the rate of inflation, however, we could well see the next major upswing in prices within the next two years.&quot;    The executives also foresee interest rates and the prime rate edging up slightly and stable foreign currency markets. </TEXT></DOC>
