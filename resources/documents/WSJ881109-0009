In Tokyo, trading was locked within a narrow band, but a rumor in the market during the opening of trading in Europe that Japanese Emperor Hirohito had died pushed the dollar higher, particularly against the yen. (Officially, the emperor's condition was reported to have worsened.)    Once the dollar began to move higher, traders who had been holding longer-term, short-dollar positions moved to cover their positions before the election, adding to the slight dollar rally.    Comments by Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, during midday New York trading that U.S. inflationary pressures were subsiding and the U.S. Federal Reserve is conducting monetary policy &quot;in a more neutral mode&quot; proved to be the factor that stopped the dollar's midday rally at its intraday high of 1.7926 marks.    In late trading, the dollar stood at 1.7890 marks, up from 1.7783 marks late Monday, and at 125.73 yen, up from 124.55 yen. Sterling was trading at $1.7700, down from $1.7797 late Monday.    In Tokyo on Wednesday, the U.S. currency climbed. At the close of morning session, the dollar was trading at 125.10 yen, off from 126 yen soon after trading opened, but up from Tuesday's close of 124.73 yen.    Traders, who had gone long on the dollar as it rallied, liquidated their positions and brought the currency back down in New York trading before a second round of short-covering late in trading Tuesday pushed the dollar to its previous intraday high of 125.70 yen and close to its intraday high against the mark.    Assuming a victory in the election by Vice President George Bush, Leslie Puth, corporate foreign exchange manager with Banque Indosuez in New York said once the results are announced, &quot;we may see some further dollar buying, but it won't last long nor will the dollar go much higher.&quot;    After the election results are clear, most traders foresee a further decline in the U.S. currency.    &quot;The market is thoroughly bearish on the dollar at this point,&quot; said a trader with a Japanese bank in New York. &quot;People talk about the dollar going to 120 yen. I think it won't go down that quickly, but it will probably go down. I expect the dollar to stay fairly stable for the rest of the year or maybe go a touch lower but nothing major.&quot;    Andrew Hodge, vice president of corporate treasury services with Bank Brussels Lambert in New York, foresees a changing monetary policy in Japan from an easy-money policy to a tighter-money policy as the cause of a lower dollar before the end of the year.    &quot;What the market has missed is the depth and the extent of G-7 (Group of Seven industrialized nations) cooperation with the dollar being supported by a Japanese easy-money policy all year long,&quot; Mr. Hodge said. &quot;Japanese policy has been so easy, that they have had to compensate in other areas such as credit controls.&quot;    After the U.S. election, Mr. Hodge foresees a tightening of credit by the Japanese that will cause capital to begin flowing toward the yen and away from the dollar.    On the U.S. side of the equation, Mr. Hodge said the improved October U.S. jobs data, the election and an expected improvement in the U.S. September trade deficit over the August report will all lend only temporary support to the dollar on its downward trend.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery dropped $3.70 to $419.10 an ounce. Estimated volume was a moderate 2.8 million ounces.    In Hong Kong early Wednesday, gold was quoted at $416.85 an ounce. </TEXT></DOC>
