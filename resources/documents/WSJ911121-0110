Mr. Milken, who left the company in 1989 and pleadedguilty last year to six securities-related felonies, said inthe court filing that all his investment transactions wereauthorized by Drexel's top executives. Mr. Milken has beenaccused by Drexel of improperly arranging for himself andothers to profit from employee-partnership deals, to thedetriment to Drexel clients and investors.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Milken also claimed that Drexel used him as a &quot;privatebank,&quot; turning to him to commit large amounts of his owncapital to finance Drexel transactions without the firmrisking its own money. Mr. Milken alleged that Drexel evenasked him to help bail out the company just before it filedfor bankruptcy-law protection in February 1990, even thoughsuch aid was barred by Drexel's own settlement withsecurities regulators.   A spokesman for Drexel said company executives wereunaware of any discussions seeking Mr. Milken's help beforethe bankruptcy filing.   Mr. Milken's claims were made in his response to a lawsuitfiled by Drexel in federal court in Manhattan in September.Drexel is seeking the return of more than $1.2 billion incompensation paid to Mr. Milken, plus damages, for allegedbreach of fiduciary duty, racketeering, theft of corporateopportunity and other wrongdoing. Mr. Milken's claims, ifupheld by the court, could be used to offset any damages wonby Drexel.   In his reply, Mr. Milken denied the company's accusationsand said that even the wrongdoing he admitted in the criminalcase last year was done for Drexel's benefit.   &quot;Now he's going to tell his story,&quot; said Mark Belnick, anattorney for Mr. Milken at the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind,Wharton andamp; Garrison in New York. Referring to Drexel's suitagainst Mr. Milken, Mr. Belnick added, &quot;This is clearly acase of someone biting the hand that feeds them.&quot;   David Boies, an attorney for Drexel with the law firmCravath, Swaine andamp; Moore, said, &quot;You know someone is runningfor cover when they bring up the devil-made-me-do-itdefense.&quot;   In its own settlement with the government, Drexel in 1989pleaded guilty to six felonies and agreed to pay $650 millionin fines and other penalties. Mr. Milken, as part of hisseparate settlement, agreed to pay fines and other penaltiestotaling $600 million. Mr. Milken is seeking a reduction ofhis 10-year prison sentence, which he began serving in March.   In his filing, Mr. Milken also alleged that former DrexelChief Executive Frederick Joseph, Mr. Milken's boss atDrexel, gave him the go-ahead in the partnership transactionsthat Drexel now claims were improper. As a result, Mr. Milkensaid in his counterclaims, Mr. Joseph should also be heldliable if Mr. Milken is found to have stolen any corporateopportunities or assets from Drexel.   Bert Rein, Mr. Joseph's attorney in Washington, D.C., saidMr. Joseph was unaware of Mr. Milken's alleged wrongdoing atthe time because Mr. Milken's activities were &quot;surreptitiousand well-disguised.&quot;   In addition to his compensation from January 1988 to June1989, when he left Drexel, Mr. Milken claims he is owed $62.4million for Drexel stock that the company agreed to buy backfrom him in September 1989. No estimate was provided forcompensation, but Mr. Milken made as much as $550 million inhis best year.   &quot;Drexel never informed Mr. Milken or even suggested to himthat, if he was convicted, he would be working for nothing,and would be required to forfeit all of his compensation backto the firm,&quot; the court filing said. &quot;If Michael Milken hadbeen so informed, he wouldn't have continued working for thefirm.&quot;   Mr. Milken also said that top Drexel officials rebuffedhis advice that the company get out of the business offinancing hostile takeovers and risking its capital byoffering so-called bridge loans to clients. He said in thecourt filing that Drexel could have avoided bankruptcy if ithadn't ignored his advice to reduce the risks it was takingin the bridge loans, which are used to tide a borrower overuntil high-risk, high yield &quot;junk bond&quot; financing isarranged.   Lowell Milken, who worked for his brother in the junk-bonddepartment and was named as a co-defendant in Drexel's suit,also filed a response denying the allegations. He alsoaccused Drexel of not paying his 1988 and 1989 compensation,among other things.</TEXT></DOC>
