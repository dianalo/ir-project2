The price moderation reflected the biggest drop in energy pricesin more than two years and the smallest increase in food costs thisyear.   The 0.2 percent June rise in the Consumer Price Index, thegovernment's primary gauge of inflation at the retail level, wasjust one-third the 0.6 percent increase recorded in May.   Even with the slowdown, prices at the consumer level rose at aseasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.9 percent in the first sixmonths of 1989, the fastest pace for the first half of a year since1982.   But the moderate June advance, the smallest increase since asimilar 0.2 percent rise in February 1988, was certain to be seen asgood news at the Federal Reserve Board, which has been concernedthat the country might be on the verge of another inflationaryspiral.   Today's report on consumer prices, coupled with news last weekthat wholesale prices actually fell in June, provided concreteevidence that the spurt in prices in the early part of 1989 wasfinally beginning to moderate.   Patrick Jackman, a Labor Department analyst, said price pressuresover the next several months should moderate enough to keep consumerinflation for all of 1989 down at around 5 percent. Prices rose 4.4percent in both 1987 and 1988.   The trouble at the beginning of the year was that energy prices,driven by the run-up in world petroleum prices, shot up at an annualrate of 40.3 percent.   However, energy prices at the consumer level actually fell by 1percent in June, the biggest decline since a 1.9 percent drop inOctober 1986.   Food costs, which had been climbing at the fastest pace since1980, moderated as well in June, rising by just 0.2 percent,reflecting a declining impact from last summer's drought.   While both food and energy prices moderated in June, other costswere held in check as well. The Consumer Price Index, excluding foodand energy, rose only 0.2 percent in June, down from a 0.5 percentadvance in May.   Food prices edged up just 0.2 percent in June, reflecting inlarge part a sharp turnaround in fruit and vegetable costs. Pricesof these products declined 1 percent in June after surging 3.2percent in May.   Prices also fell for dairy products, beef and pork.   The 1 percent drop in overall energy costs reflected a 1 percentdrop in gasoline prices at the pump and declines for home heatingoil, natural gas and electricity costs.   Clothing costs fell 1.1 percent in June, after increasing 2.3percent in the first five months of the year. The big decline wascredited to larger than usual end-of-season price reductions,particularly in women's clothing.   Medical costs rose 0.7 percent in June, the biggest advance forany of the major categories, with doctors' costs, hospital costs andprescription drug costs all rising sharply.   The various changes in June left the overall Consumer Price Indexat 124.1 of its 1982-84 base. That means that a hypotheticalselection of goods costing $100 during the base period would havecost $124.10 in June.   In a separate report today, the Labor Department said Americans'average weekly earnings, after adjusting for inflation, wereunchanged in June after falling 1.4 percent in May.   Average weekly earnings in June, before adjusting for inflation,were $332.43, up 3.2 percent from a year earlier. Taking the 5.2percent inflation rate for urban workers into account over the12-month period, real weekly earnings were down 1.9 percent.   With back-to-back good reports showing inflation moderating atboth the wholesale and retail levels, many economists are optimisticabout the price outlook for the rest of the year.   ``I think we're past the worst (on inflation) and now thequestion is the running rate'' of where inflation will settle down,said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co.   Donald Ratajczak, director of the economic forecasting project atGeorgia State University, said he was looking for gasoline prices tofall for a couple of months and smaller upward pressure on foodcosts for the rest of the year.   ``The surge in inflation from the drought and oil is now over,''he said.   But not all economists are convinced inflation pressures aremoderating.   Michael Evans, head of a Washington forecasting firm, said thatoutside the favorable developments in energy and food prices, otherareas were still under price pressures.   ``The underlying rate of inflation isn't declining at all. Ifanything, it is getting a little worse,'' Evans said.   The Bush administration, in releasing its mid-year update on theeconomy, predicted Tuesday that consumer prices would rise by 4.9percent this year, up only slightly from last year's 4.4 percentincrease.   ``The administration remains confident of the future course ofthe U.S. economy,'' said Michael Boskin, chairman of the president'sCouncil of Economic Advisers.</TEXT></DOC>
