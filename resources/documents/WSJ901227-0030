Word of the SEC inquiry, which was first reported byDefense Week, a trade publication, comes on the heels of aseparate criminal investigation into the A-12 project. Thatprobe is being led by the U.S. attorney in St. Louis, whereboth companies are based.</LP><TEXT>   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has given the contractorsuntil Wednesday to devise a plan to save the A-12, whichalthough designed to replace the Navy's aging fleet of A-6attack planes, has been plagued by cost overruns, technicalsnags and schedule slips.   &quot;The SEC has informed us that they are conducting aninformal inquiry related to our disclosures about andaccounting for the A-12 program,&quot; a McDonnell Douglasspokesman said.   A General Dynamics spokesman said the company is &quot;awarethere's an investigation going on,&quot; but wouldn't commentfurther. In Washington, an SEC spokesman declined comment.   In the second quarter, General Dynamics registered a $450million charge against earnings on the A-12, while McDonnellDouglas used a different accounting method and didn't take awriteoff. &quot;We believe it's the difference in reporting thatled to the inquiry,&quot; the McDonnell Douglas spokesman said.</TEXT></DOC>
