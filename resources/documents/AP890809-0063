(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   More than 100 Savannah River Site employeesdrank water contaminated with a carcinogenic solvent for 15 months,but an official from the nuclear weapons plant says they were notharmed.   The incident occurred after a drinking water supply line wasmistakenly connected to a system carrying tainted process water,said Becky Apter, a spokeswoman for Westinghouse Savannah RiverCo., which operates the plant for the government.   None of the workers have shown symptoms of illness associatedwith trichloroethylene, or TCE, a potent degreaser and solvent thatwas found in the water, she said.   ``The health effects are nonexistent,'' Ms. Apter said. ``Whatour doctors told us was the level of exposure they consumed was solow that there would be minimal health effects.''   Reactors at Savannah River, the nation's sole source of tritiumfor nuclear weapons, have been closed for more than a year becauseof maintenance and safety problems.   The mistake occurred in March 1988, when a water line was beinginstalled to a new building. Du Pont, which built the facility andoperated it for about 30 years, was plant operator at the time andthe work was performed by a subcontractor Ms. Apter would notidentify.   A Du Pont engineer who was responsible for the job certified ithad been done correctly, Ms. Apter said. But state officials saidthe engineer was working from an erroneous blueprint.   Ms. Apter declined to identify the engineer, who she said wasstill employed at the facility.   Medical records for all the employees were checked after thecontamination was discovered, and physicians found no relatedhealth problems, she said.   The contaminated water was found in only one building, officialssaid after testing water in all buildings in the administrationarea.   ``Although federal drinking water standards were exceeded, thelevels monitored in the service water are well below what would beconsidered dangerous,'' said Jim Hightower, a Savannah Riverphysician. ``However, we will continue to assess any possiblehealth effects as part of the annual medical examination program.''   Samples from the building with the contaminated water showedlevels of TCE averaged 26 parts per billion. The EnvironmentalProtection Agency considers 5 parts per billion a safe level.   TCE has caused cancer in laboratory animals and is suspected ofdoing so in humans. The chemical also has been shown to causedamage to the liver and other organs, as well as sterility,developmental problems in children and damage to the nervoussystem, according to the EPA.   The mixup in the water systems was discovered last month whenrepairs were made to the system, Ms. Apter said. When workers wereunable to turn off the water they realized the two systems wereconnected.</TEXT></DOC>
