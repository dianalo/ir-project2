Amorphous alloy irradiationis found to cause the weakening of the temperature dependence of theelectric resistance in the pre-recrystallization temperature intervaland to expand and shift considerably the temperature region of crystallization.The supposition is made that the character of these changes is determinednot only by the nature of radiation damage, but mainly by the degreeand the character of change in defects distribution spectrum in sizes.6 refs.; 4 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
