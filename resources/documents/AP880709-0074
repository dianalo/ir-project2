Ozone prompted air pollution advisories in Chicago every daylast week and caused standards to be violated in Vermont for thefirst time in recent memory.   Several states and cities warned people with lung problems tocurtail activities and stay inside during the afternoon. New Yorkhad a statewide advisory on Friday.   The new peaks come at a time when the Environmental ProtectionAgency is considering whether new ozone standards are neededbecause of unexpected lung damage under certain conditions.   They also coincide with warnings from some scientists that thelong-predicted ``greenhouse effect'' warming of the earth hasbegun, and hot, dry ozone-prone summers are going to become morefrequent.   James Hansen, a climatologist at the National Aeronautics andSpace Administration, says hot summers _ with ``hot'' defined asthe warmest one-third of all summers in 1951-1980 _ could occurhalf the time in the mid-1990s.   Heat speeds up ozone formation. Temperature inversions may trapozone near the ground and keep it from dispersing.   Though in the stratosphere ozone protects the earth from harmfulultraviolet rays of the sun, at ground level EPA has defined it asunhealthy in concentrations over 0.12 parts per million for anhour. Ozone constricts the air passages in the lung. It is thechemical than makes your chest feel tight in smog.   Three things make ozone: sunlight, oxides of nitrogen fromburning fossil fuels and compounds like those found in unburnedgasoline vapor, which react with the nitrogen oxides.Concentrations peak in the afternoon and decline at night.   The chief weapon for fighting ozone is reduction of gasolinevapors through controls on cars. Some areas require autoinspections and vapor recovery at service stations.   The junking of older, dirtier cars has brought cleaner air tomany cities, but EPA lists 68 cities and rural areas as violatingozone standards.   The latest research, part of a wave of new findings that startedabout two years ago, could mean an additional standard covering alonger period like six or eight hours, said Bruce Jordan, head ofthe standards section in EPA's air program. That could take 18months to develop, he said.   Most ozone research has concentrated on peak exposure, but newwork shows that several hours of exposure at elevated levels meansit takes less exercise to bring on restricted breathing. ``We'veseen an effect at 0.08 ppm for 6.6 hours,'' said Jordan. ``Our realconcern is multiple hits (of peaks and valleys of exposure) ... youseem to get more damage than with a constant exposure.''   Animal studies show that lung damage from high concentrationstends to persist, something the agency hopes to confirm or rule outthrough human autopsy studies.   Some reports from the field:   _At Bennington in the southwest corner of Vermont, a monitorrecorded ozone concentrations of 0.125 ppm on two days in June.``I'm not prepared to say what the origin is, but the majority hasto be interstate transport,'' said Brian Fitzgerald of the stateNatural Resources Agency.   In other words, pollutants emitted in Massachusetts,Connecticut, New York and other upwind points early in the day werestill forming ozone after having been blown into Vermont.   He said no one could remember the last violation, but hebelieved it was three or four years ago.   _Washington, D.C., as of Friday had seen 15 days in which thestandard had been violated, compared with six expected in a normalyear. The peak reading, 0.19 ppm on Thursday, has not been matchedin nine years.   _Chicago has had nine days over the standard, compared with anestimated seven in a normal year. The city issued its first``yellow alert'' in a decade, the first step up from an advisory,for readings at three monitors over 0.20 ppm last Thursday, with apeak of 0.223 ppm.   _Louisville, Ky., has had seven days over the limit vs. six inall of 1987. Gary Wilson, technical services supervisor, said, ``Myonly comment is, Lord, send us some rain.'' But the long-rangeforecast, he said, is ``dismal,'' with the same weather patternexpected for all of July.   _Five cities in Pennsylvania _ Harrisburg, Scanton-Wilkes Barre,Reading, Altoona and Erie _ have had readings high enough this yearalone to win them official designation as ``non-attainment areas,''something EPA does after averaging data for three years.   _Richmond, Va., has had nine days above the standard this year,tying the 1983 record.   _New York City has had 11 days over, compared with 16 in all oflast year.</TEXT></DOC>
