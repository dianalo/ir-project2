As part of a strike, Machinists union officials said they alsowould picket outside Eastern's sister carrier, Continental Airlines,plus other airlines, ships and transportation services covered bythe federal Railway Labor Act.   ``We're talking about a total disruption of transportation inthis country,'' said Frank Ortis, Machinists Local 702 vicepresident.   Machinists leaders have been authorized by their 8,500 members tocall a strike after midnight Friday, which marks the end of a 30-daycooling-off period set by federal mediators.   Ortis and AFL-CIO strike organizer Gary Horton helped lead arally and news conference Tuesday in which dozens of local unionswere represented.   ``We will urge our 14 million members not to cross any picketlines,'' Horton said. ``It means that those members would probablynot fly on Eastern or Continental. Secondarily, they would be out torallies, they would be out to strike sites, they would be out tofinancally support the Machinists.''   Eastern officials have expressed doubt the Machinists can legallyor practically spur a nationwide action.   Eastern, which says it is losing more than $1 million a day,wants $150 million in wage concessions from the Machinists, whorepresent mechanics, baggage handlers and other ground servicesworkers.   The National Mediation Board, which entered the 17-month-oldcontract dispute in January 1988, has asked President Bush toappoint an emergency panel that could delay a strike 60 days.Eastern says it can't afford the delay, but the AFL-CIO andMachinists support the emergency panel.   Separately, the Machinists filed court papers denying thecompany's complaint to U.S. District Judge C. Clyde Atkins that theunion was violating Atkins' injunction against a work slowdown.Atkins scheduled a hearing for today.   Meanwhile, the Eastern pilots union said Tuesday it wascontinuing talks with management on a new contract covering jobsecurity and other issues.   Air Line Pilots Association leaders have urged their 3,500Eastern members to honor Machinists picket lines. However, pilotsunion members indicated last week they might cross picket lines ifEastern granted contract concessions.   Pilots generally are considered the most crucial andhardest-to-replace airline employees in a strike.   Eastern has declined to comment on negotiations this week.</TEXT></DOC>
