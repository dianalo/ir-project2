The aim ofthis work is to show the continuous laser beam welding of long unitson an assembly line, which is essential for an industrial cable production.Preliminary investigations and test results of weld performance obtainedwith different multikilowatt power CO/sub 2/ type laser work stationsare encouraging for a near term use of the laser weld processing in thisparticular aspect. The analysis confirms that laser beam welding hasprospects which makes it feasible for industrial manufacturing processcombined with good economics.</TEXT></DOC>
