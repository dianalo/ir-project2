At Chicago-based Ameritech, profit fell 6.6%, reflecting a loss on the sale of a unit. Earnings increased 71% for Cincinnati Bell Inc., aided by information systems and core-business improvements. Southwestern Bell Corp. profit rose 2.9%, mostly because of new telephone-line growth and tax adjustments. And BellSouth Corp. earnings, meanwhile, were flat despite business growth.    Ameritech   The decline in Ameritech's third-quarter earnings in part reflected increased operating expenses.    But most of the drop was attributed to the sale last month of its Applied Data Research Inc. unit -- which reduced profit by about $8.2 million, or six cents a shareand to accounting changes ordered by the Federal Communications Commission. Expenses climbed 7.6% to $1.98 billion, from $1.84 billion a year earlier.    Revenue rose 3.3% to $2.51 billion from $2.43 billion. Revenue from telephone operations increased 7% to $634.6 million, while long-distance connection services surged 10.5% to $327.9 million.    William L. Weiss, Ameritech's chairman and chief executive officer, said the company had its &quot;largest telephone-line increase ever,&quot; a 2.5% jump for a total of 371,000 lines installed.    Non-telephone operations, including directory publishing, had revenue of $411.1 million, a rise of 4.7%. A segment that continues to grow rapidly is Ameritech's Mobile Communications unit, which doubled its customer base to 130,000 from a year ago.    Earnings for the nine months increased 7.1% to $927.7 million, or $6.80 a share, from $865.9 million, or $6.14 a share. Revenue rose 4.2% to $7.40 billion, from $7.10 billion.    Yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Ameritech shares fell 75 cents to close at $93.75.    Cincinnati Bell   Cincinnati Bell's third-quarter earnings surge came primarily with strong performance in telephone and information-systems operations.    Operating profit from the basic telephone business in the quarter increased 11% to $28 million from $25.2 million, while profits from the information systems unit more than doubled to $8.2 million from $3.7 million a year earlier.    Revenue for the quarter increased 18% to $191.5 million from $162.6 million. Cincinnati's recently acquired Vanguard Technologies International Inc. also contributed to revenue in the third quarter.    For the nine months, earnings rose 44% to $67 million, or $2.11 a share, from $46.5 million, or $1.45 a share. Revenue jumped 18% to $543.3 million from $459.4 million a year earlier.    On the Big Board, Cincinnati Bell closed yesterday at $37.75, up 37.5 cents.    Southwestern Bell   Southwestern Bell's earnings benefited from a tax adjustment of $16 million, or five cents a share.    Revenue rose 7.1% to $2.23 billion, from $2.09 billion. Non-telephone operations of the St. Louis-based company, particularly cellular and paging businesses, contributed about 66% of the growth.    Cellular and paging operations exceeded expectations for customer growth during the third quarter. Cellular operations added about 22,000 new customers, a 40% increase, while paging had 19,000 new customers, a 13% increase.    Zane E. Barns, Southwestern Bell's chairman and chief executive officer, said he expects the company's cellular properties to be profitable by the end of 1989.    In new telephone lines, Southwestern Bell had its best quarterly performance since 1985. New telephone lines quadrupled. The company added 114,866 new lines in the third quarter, up 88,866 from 26,000 a year earlier. About 62% of the growth came from Texas, signaling that the state's economy may be improving.    &quot;We view this growth as an encouraging sign of better economic times,&quot; Mr. Barns said.    For the nine months, Southwestern Bell reported that net income slumped 5.7% to $754.9 million, or $2.51 a share, compared with $800.6 million, or $2.66 a share. Revenue grew 7.1% to $6.27 billion from $5.85 billion. To date, the company has installed a total of 197,000 new telephone lines.    On the Big Board yesterday, Southwestern Bell shares closed at $40.625, down 25 cents.    BellSouth   Expansion expenses and accounting changes eroded earnings for Atlanta-based BellSouth.    The company said overall expenses in the quarter jumped 16% to $2.69 billion from $2.31 billion a year earlier.    Non-telephone operations and growth in new telephone lines helped revenue surge 11% to $3.46 billion from $3.11 billion a year earlier.    Most of the revenue growth came from non-telephone operations. Those revenues increased 45% to $757.6 million from $524.1 million, while revenues from long distance calls made within the same area code rose 8% to $427.1 million from $394.6 million.    New telephone lines continue to grow at a clip of 4.5% annually. The company added 216,000 new telephone lines in the third quarter for a total of 16.3 million. So far this year, the company has added 537,000 lines.    For the nine months, BellSouth earned $1.246 billion, or $2.61 a share, compared with $1.253 billion, or $2.61 a share. Revenue totaled $10.02 billion, compared with $9.08 billion.    BellSouth closed at $41.125, down $1, on the New York Stock Exchange.    ---                         1988             1987                      in      per      in      per     %                   millions  share   millions  share  chg.
