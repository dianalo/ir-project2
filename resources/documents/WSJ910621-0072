The GOP version, put together from proposals made byPresident Bush and by Democratic Sen. Joseph Biden ofDelaware, was defeated 56-40. Democrats declared a politicalvictory, but the fight will continue today and probably nextweek as Republicans attempt to kill some provisions of theDemocratic package sponsored by Mr. Biden.</LP><TEXT>   Just before the vote yesterday, Senate Majority LeaderGeorge Mitchell said in a weary voice that the perennialcongressional debate about &quot;getting tough on crime&quot; haslittle to do with making the nation's streets safer.&quot;Changing the federal law is going to change a minusculepercent of violent crime in our society,&quot; the Maine Democratsaid, as a huge majority of violent crimes are prosecutedunder state laws by state authorities.   Nevertheless, the Senate is expected eventually to pass abill expanding the federal death penalty, curbing federalappeals by death-row inmates and allowing juries to considerevidence gathered illegally but in &quot;good faith&quot; by police.The Senate also is expected to authorize billions of dollarsin new anti-crime spending, with $1 billion intended forstate and local agencies. A separate congressional actionwould be needed to appropriate that money; because of overallbudget constraints, Congress isn't likely to appropriate themoney this year.   Moreover, some lawmakers predicted that even if the Senatepasses some of the anti-crime measures, the provisions won'treach President Bush's desk.   &quot;Whatever bill we pass here has little chance of passingthe House,&quot; Senate Republican leader Robert Dole of Kansassaid before last night's vote. Similar crime legislation diedlast year when a House-Senate conference ended in stalemate.   The rejected Republican alternative would have providedfor stricter curbs on death-row appeals and a more lenientrule on jury consideration of illegally gathered evidence.Acknowledging defeat on another issue, the Democrats alloweda vote that deleted from the Biden bill a legal defenseagainst the death penalty based on the claim that capitalpunishment is imposed in a racially discriminatory fashion.</TEXT></DOC>
