However more efficient greenhouses have introduced anotherenvironmental problem, namely the high internal humidity, which is detrimentalto the greenhouse crop. The use of a heat pump presents an opportunityto control the environment and at the same time to provide the necessaryheat supply to maintain the greenhouse temperature, thereby enablingan energy efficient control strategy to be achieved. A simulation ofa double clad greenhouse structure is developed and a knowledge basedcontrol system that seeks to maintain a specified temperature - humidityprofile, with minimum energy consumption, according to the needs of thegrowth characteristics of a given plant (tomatoes) is setup.</TEXT></DOC>
