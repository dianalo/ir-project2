Expects To Report a Decline In First-Period Profit </HL><SO> </SO><CO> FTK </CO><DATELINE> HEBRON, Ill.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Filtertek Cos. said it expects to report lower first-quarter profit, in part reflecting start-up costs associated with new products and with losses in acquired operations.    The maker of filtration elements used in auto, health care and other industrial and consumer applications also said it suspended efforts to sell the company after receiving several serious inquiries.    Filtertek said it expects to report net income of about $1 million for the quarter, compared with year-earlier net of about $1.6 million, or 23 cents a share. The company didn't estimate per-share net income for the most recent quarter. Sales were about 20% higher than the year-earlier $7.7 million, the company said.    Last July, Filtertek announced it had retained an investment banker to explore ways to increase shareholder value, including possibly selling Filtertek to another concern. Talks with four companies ensued, but those discussions were unsuccessful, a spokesman said. </TEXT></DOC>
