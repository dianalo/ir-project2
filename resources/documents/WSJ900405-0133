It isusually the case that political leaders are not veryknowledgeable themselves, but they have a team of experts whoare. Some highly qualified economists, such as Ambassador andOxford Professor Guido di Tella, Harvard-trained ForeignAffairs Minister Domingo Cavallo and Berkeley's AlietoGuadagni, are currently working for the Argentine government.This was also true of the Alfonsin administration (alsocriticized by Mr. Gallagher): It included very capableHarvard, Chicago and Minnesota economists, yet the result wasdismal.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Gallagher seems to hold a simplistic view in whichcountries do poorly due to the incompetence of their leaders.He even goes into suggesting a rich menu of policies, such aselimination of monopolies, liberation of labor markets,reform of the tax system, etc. Today every person of averageintelligence in Argentina would agree in principle with thosemeasures. Why, then, are they not taken immediately?   To answer that let me briefly review different levels ofeconomic analysis as applied to the problem. The mostsuperficial is macroeconomics, or monetary theory, whichascribes inflation to mismanagement of the money supply. Mr.Gallagher seems to be at what I will call the second level,which goes beyond the monetary veil and observes manymicroeconomic inefficiencies and proposes several measuressuch as those mentioned. My opinion is that the second levelstill fails to understand the political and sociologicalnature of the problem. It is by applying political-sciencetools like Game Theory that one can understand why such&quot;basic&quot; measures are not taken.   Argentina is a complex society, with enough strongpressure groups to make a coordinated action (the only wayout in my view) very difficult. Still, power is not dispersedenough to make it a competitive society. That is whycoordination is necessary. The past decades have seen thosesectors fighting a distributive battle, channeled through apaternalistic state, from which they asked more than theirshare, generating a gap that was financed by inflation.Economists have been asking for measures such as those on Mr.Gallagher's list for a long time. Only now they are startingto understand the Prisoner's Dilemma nature of the problem:Everyone could be better off in the long run if the rightmeasures are taken, but we are afraid that our short-runsacrifice would be futile, given that the others will &quot;cheat&quot;to improve their position.   I consider that, even if Mr. Menem's chances of successare slim, the odds would be even worse were the governmentheaded by someone better trained in economics, but with lesspolitical leverage. Mr. Menem has the advantage of havingmore control over those powerful interest groups than hispredecessor. The Peronist Party traditionally has smootherrelations with trade unions, the military and someindustrialists. The &quot;right turn&quot; taken by Mr. Menem is notonly due to the recognition that market-oriented policies arenecessary, but also to the fact that they can buy the supportof some historical enemies such as agro-exporters.   For a long time economists believed that it waspoliticians' fault not to understand economics well enough.Now we are starting to realize that it is the other wayaround.   Mariano Tommasi   Department of Economics   University of Chicago   Chicago   ---   I was surprised that Mr. Gallagher's otherwise excellentarticle on Latin America's most remarkable politician (MarioVargas Llosa, now the leading candidate for the presidency ofPeru) contained no mention of the man who almostsingle-handedly converted Peruvians to capitalism: Hernandode Soto. In his masterpiece &quot;El Sendaro Otro&quot; (&quot;The OtherPath&quot;), he showed how the small free market, operating withno legal protection, provided the vast majority of Peru'sproduction. He also showed how the current Peruviangovernment works to frustrate any attempt to work within thelaw. If Mr. Vargas Llosa succeeds in turning Peru capitalist,he will doubtless have many to thank, but the greatest thanksof all should go to Hernando de Soto.   Jim Allman   St. Louis</TEXT></DOC>
