PLC to determine whether the investment harmsthe public interest.   The Department of Trade and Industry said it would refer theacquisition, made by the Kuwaiti government's London-basedinvestment vehicle _ the Kuwait Investment Office _ to theMonopolies and Mergers Commission.   Trade Secretary Lord Young said ``the implications of BP comingunder the influence or control of a government with substantial oilinterests and which is a member of OPEC raised questions of publicinterest.''   Britain, the world's fifth-largest oil producer, is not a memberof the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and hasn'tcooperated with the cartel's efforts to control prices viaproduction restraints.   BP shares were down about 9 cents to $4.99 on London's StockExchange at about midday.   The monopolies commission will deliver its report within fourmonths, the trade department said.   The investigation does not necessarily reflect a governmentintention to force the Kuwaiti government to sell any of its stake,but might serve as a warning against further purchases.   The Kuwait Investment Office, which refused to comment on thereferral, has said it is only interested in the BP stake as along-term investment. It has not indicated any plans for a takeoverbid.   Last week, BP Chairman Sir Peter Walters told shareholders attheir annual meeting that the Kuwaiti stake ``is a highershareholding than one would wish to see'' and that it createdpotential uncertainty about the company's future.   Oil industry analysts said the government would be breaking newground in studying the stake. But some discounted the possibilitythat Kuwait would attempt to acquire BP.   ``There's just no great takeover story in this,'' said CarolBell, an oil industry analyst with the London investment firmPhillips and Drew Ltd.   The Kuwait Investment Office has accrued the stake over the lastsix months. It began acquiring BP shares after the government soldoff its remaining 31.5 percent stake in the oil company in the fall.</TEXT></DOC>
