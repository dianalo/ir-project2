GRAY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Wildlife groups say Thailand isdecimating its own once teeming species and those of other nationsthrough bear-feast tours for Koreans, caiman skin smuggling and the``Polish Connection.''   The Swiss-based World Wildlife Fund for Nature and otherenvironmental groups cite numerous examples of wanton destruction:   _South Koreans fly to Thailand on organized tours to feast onbear meat, which they believe enhances vigor and strength,according to Phisit na Phattlung, the Wildlife Fund's head inThailand.   _Thailand was the major link in an operation to illegallysmuggle about 120,000 skins of South American caiman alligators toJapan last year.   _The International Primate Protection League charges that Thaitraders fake permits to send white-handed gibbons and otherprotected species to zoos in Poland. Lacking funds, the Polesobtain the animals on credit, keep about a third of them and sellthe rest to Western zoos.   The Wildlife Fund has recently singled out Thailand and threeother nations _ Indonesia, Spain and Argentina _ as blatantviolators of the Convention on International Trade in EndangeredSpecies of Wild Fauna and Flora. Thailand is a party to the 1975convention, which seeks to halt an illegal worldwide trade valuedat some $5 billion each year.   Frequently cited as reasons for Thailand's poor conservationrecord are its wildly capitalist economy, widespread corruption,poverty in rural areas and inadequate wildlife legislation.   A yawning legal loophole allows the export of even endangeredanimals from other than domestic sources, Phisit notes. Thus Thaitraders obtain wild animals from nearby Laos, Burma and Cambodia orproduce fake documents to show that animals captured in Thailandcame from these countries. This loophole facilitates smugglingconnections from South America, Africa, Australia and other partsof Asia.   Once a tropical wonderland, Thailand has ravaged its own forestsand their once richly varied inhabitants.   ``Everything is for sale,'' said Phisit, who has monitoredwildlife exploitation for two decades.   Elephants, tigers, wild cattle and deer are poached in nationalparks. Rare wild orchids are plucked for unregulated export. Cobrasare slaughtered by the thousands for their skins, meat and thepurported medicinal power of their gall bladders. Eagles, hawks andother birds of prey are sold to visiting Arab falconers.   Stress, poor food and lack of knowledge about animal care taketheir toll during and after capture. In snaring baby gibbons andother primates, for example, the mothers are normally shot byhunters.   Further loss of life occurs during overseas shipment when theanimals are often drugged and smuggled in airless boxes, falsebottoms of containers and empty oil drums.   This year only seven of 114 slow lorises _ small, large-eyedlemurs _ survived a journey via forged export documents fromThailand to Japan.   ``People have been buying and selling animals for centuries,''Phisit told a group of journalists recently. ``It's the cruelty andloss of life along the way that we are against.''   Phisit and other conservationists also assail what they call thelackluster performance of Thai authorities who in turn complain ofinadequate resources and little legal power to move against thetraffickers.   Vendors in areas frequented by foreign tourists try to sell slowlorises sometimes drugged with paint thinner to render themsubmissive, or gibbons whose teeth have been chipped to preventpossible bites.   A local newspaper recently interviewed a dealer who explainedhow some gibbons are decapitated while still alive and their headspreserved for sale as souvenirs at Bangkok's Weekend Market, wherewildlife is frequently on display on Saturdays and Sundays.   ``There are posters at the market asking people to telephone theWildlife Department if they see wildlife traded,'' Phisit said.``But you can call until you drop dead because it's Sunday andnobody works in the office.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Nov. 5</NOTE></DOC>
