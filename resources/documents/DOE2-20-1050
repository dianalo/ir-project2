Large-scale blade production requirementsin support of the expanding market for smaller wind turbines from 1982through 1985, combined with the extensive design and testing programssupporting the large NASA MOD-5A rotor, resulted in an advanced bladetechnology ideally suited for the intermediate-sized wind turbines underdevelopment today.</TEXT></DOC>
