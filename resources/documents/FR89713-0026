The intended effects ofthis rule are to prevent the adverse impacts on the users of traditionalgill net and hook-and-line gear where, under necessary quota restrictionson overfished stocks, the use of drift gill nets would contribute to earlyclosures of the commercial fisheries, such closures being the likely resultof allowing the introduction of drift gill nets into the commercial fisheriesfor overfished stocks of king and Spanish mackerel; and to clarify theregulations. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>August 14, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </T2>Mark F. Godcharles, 813-893-3722.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The fishery for coastal migratory pelagicfish (king mackerel, Spanish mackerel, cero, cobia, little tunny, dolphin,and, in the Gulf of Mexico only, bluefish) is managed under the FMP, preparedby the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic Fishery Management Councils (Councils),and its implementing regulations at 50 CFR Part 642, under the authorityof the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act).Amendment 3 to the FMP, as submitted by the Councils, proposed to: (1)Prohibit the use of purse seines for the Atlantic migratory group of kingmackerel; (2) prohibit the use of drift gill nets for all coastal migratorypelagic species; (3) prohibit the use of run-around gill nets for the Atlanticmigratory group of king mackerel; (4) add an objective to minimize wasteand bycatch in the fishery; (5) update the habitat section of the FMP;and (6) evaluate the effects of the FMP on vessel and crew safety. Backgroundand analysis of these measures were included in the proposed rule (54 FR14256, April 10, 1989) and are not repeated here. Based upon the most recent assessment of the mackerel stocks and commentsreceived during Secretarial review of the amendment and the proposed rule,Amendment 3 has been partially approved. Specifically, NOAA has approveda prohibition on the use of drift gill nets in fisheries for Gulf groupking mackerel and Gulf and Atlantic groups of Spanish mackerel. These threegroups are overfished, necessitating restrictive quotas to protect andrebuild these stocks. Resulting commercial quotas have been so low thatexisting users with traditional gears (hook-and-line and run-around gillnets) already take the entire quota. Under these circumstances, NOAA agreeswith the Councils that it would be unfair to allow the introduction ofdrift gill nets (a gear presently not used in commercial fisheries forthese three groups) in an already stressed industry. Further, the fishingpotential of drift gill nets is such that quota overruns could occur beforeclosures could be effected, thus conservation purposes would not be served.This prohibition is approved with the proviso that the Councils will reconsiderthe use of this gear when the stocks recover and the other gear types cannottake the entire quota. NOAA has also approved the updated habitat sectionof the FMP, as well as the vessel safety considerations. Disapproved measures are those that would prohibit the use of nets forharvesting Atlantic group king mackerel and other coastal pelagic speciesand the addition of a new objective. Disapproval was based upon insufficientjustification for the proposed actions, and non-compliance with the MagnusonAct and other applicable law as discussed below. The disapproved measuresare severable and do not disrupt the continuity of the approved portionsof the amendment. <ITAG tagnum="84">Comments and Responses </ITAG>Seventy-one submissions were received reflecting the comments of 201 people.Sixty submissions supporting the proposed rule were received from constituents,primarily of the recreational sector, including 35 form letters and twopetitions bearing 119 and seven signatures, respectively. A state marineresource department and a state fisheries commission also provided supportingcomments. Eleven submissions opposing the proposed rule were received,primarily from the commercial sector. Non-supportive comments were alsocontained in a letter from a federal agency and in a minority report signedby four members of the South Atlantic and three members of the Gulf ofMexico Fishery Management Councils. Comments are addressed in three categoriesthat follow:<ITAG tagnum="84">Prohibition of Nets </ITAG><T3>Comments.</T3> Opposition to the net prohibitions outlined in the proposedrule focused on the appropriateness of eliminating net gears from the commercialfishery for Atlantic group king mackerel. Collectively, opponents contendedthat removal of net gears from this fishery (1) is inconsistent with thebest scientific information available (national standard 2) because the1989 Stock Assessment Report concluded that the Atlantic group of kingmackerel is not overfished; (2) is unjustified where the commercial quotaproposed for the 1989/90 fishing year is sufficiently high to forestallan early closure; (3) is inconsistent with national standard 1 becausehistorical landings show the hook-and-line sector alone cannot take thecommercial quota proposed, thereby preventing optimum yield (OY) from theresource; (4) unfairly removes net fishermen from competition for an availableresource, contrary to national standard 4; (5) amounts to a reallocationof the available resource among commercial fishermen, which is unrelatedto conservation objectives, also contrary to national standard 4; (6) amountsto an unwarranted regulation against efficiency, thereby depriving thepublic of less expensive fishery products, in opposition to national standard5; (7) ignores reasonable regulatory alternatives that would allow efficientnet gears to continue to operate in the fishery consistent with the objectivesof the current management regime; and (8) eliminates variation in methodsof harvesting Atlantic group king mackerel and selectively inflicts aninordinate economic burden on affected net fishermen, fish houses, andcoastal communities reliant on the resource, contrary to national standards6 and 7. With respect to the drift gill net prohibition in general, commentorssuggested it was inappropriate to extend that prohibition to other coastalmigratory species that are not overfished and to prevent the retentionof such species in other drift net fisheries in implementing a drift netprohibition, a provision which they regarded as wasteful. <T3>Response.</T3> NOAA agrees with the comments received in oppositionto the net prohibitions proposed for the Atlantic group king mackerel commercialfishery. The prohibition of net gears (drift and run-around gill nets,and purse seines) from the Atlantic group king mackerel fishery is notjustified. As reflected in Amendment 3, the prohibition on the use of driftgill nets, purse seines, and run-around gill nets in the Atlantic groupking mackerel fishery was proposed primarily because it appeared that thegroup was overfished and, under necessary quota reductions, the continueduse of these net gears would negatively impact traditional hook-and-lineparticipants by contributing to early closure of the commercial fishery.Subsequent to the formal submission of Amendment 3, the 1989 Stock AssessmentPanel determined that the Atlantic migratory group of king mackerel isnot overfished. Therefore, this part of the supporting rationale is nolonger supported by the best and most recent scientific information available.With respect to the remaining part of the rationale, the Councils' proposedincrease in TAC for the 1989/90 fishing year supports a commercial quotathat appears sufficient to allow harvest by both hook-and-line and netfishermen without an early closure. Last year's estimated total commercialharvest is well below the proposed allocation for 1989/90 fishing year.Absent the unusual environmental conditions that contributed to last year'sheavy commercial catch early in the season, catch returned to normal levelsthis past April. Thus, continued use of net gear would not negatively impacttraditional hook-and-line participants this year. Further, dedicating thecommercial quota to the hook-and-line sector almost assures that the totalcommercial quota will not be harvested, since landings show the hook-and-linefishery has historically been unable to take the amount of fish allottedto the commercial sector. Under the FMP, the TAC from which allocationsand quotas are derived represents the annual specification of OY. Therefore,this is inconsistent with national standard 1 and the FMP in that it wouldprevent achievement of OY. Prohibiting net fishermen from taking what wouldotherwise be surplus fish is also unfair and inequitable as measured againstnational standard 4. Therefore, NOAA has determined that approval of thisban on net fishing would not comply with the provisions of the MagnusonAct. Selective restrictions, instead of an outright prohibition on theentire net fishery appear feasible and would be justifiable on the recorddeveloped by the Councils. Such an action would allow the hook-and-lineand net fishermen to coexist. Such measures, if timely submitted, couldvery well be implemented prior to the commencement of the 1990/91 fishingyear. Therefore, NOAA suggests that the Councils consider this course ofaction. A prohibition against all types of net fishing for Atlantic kingmackerel is not supported by the current record.As noted above, NOAA approves the prohibition of drift gill nets from thefisheries for Gulf migratory group king mackerel and Gulf and Atlanticgroups of Spanish mackerel. Rationale for the prohibitions is essentiallythe same as that supporting the prohibition of purse seines from thesesame overfished resources as approved in Amendment 2 (54 FR 23836, June25, 1987). The approved net prohibitions will not lead to any substantivelosses necessitating action under E.O. l2630 because drift gill nets arenot known to operate in the three overfished mackerel fisheries. In thisregard, it is significant that the public comment on the proposed ruleincluded no criticism by any affected persons of the elimination of thisgear in these three fisheries. In implementing the drift net prohibitionfor these groups, NOAA has maintained the provision that prevents otherdrift net fisheries from retaining incidentally caught king and Spanishmackerel because that provision is necessary for the enforceability ofthe approved measure. <ITAG tagnum="84">New FMP Objective </ITAG><T3>Comment. </T3>The opposition recommended rejection of the newly proposedFMP objective because of its inconsistency with national standard 5. Theybelieved that this new objective to minimize waste would unfairly elevatemarket value of landed fish while removing efficient gears from the fishery.<T3>Response. </T3>NOAA disapproved the addition of the new objective,not because of disagreement with the concept of eliminating waste and bycatchin the fishery, but because of the Councils' characterization of economicwaste in the objective. The amendment describes the differences betweenex-vessel values of catches by hook-and-line and net gears as economicwaste, implying that the price differential is related solely to qualitydifferences. However, the price differential also may be related to short-termsupply fluctuations. In that regard, the implicit assumption that lowerex-vessel prices translate into economic losses is incorrect. Such notiondisregards the concept of consumer surplus and the difference between totalrevenue and producer surplus. In other words, the way the objective dealswith economic waste could lead toward inefficient methods of production,which would be inconsistent with national standard 5 of the Magnuson Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">Other Concerns </ITAG><T3>Comments. </T3>Proponents of the broad prohibition of drift gill netsproposed in the amendment cited numerous other concerns with this gearas generally supportive of the measure, including localized overfishing;negative impacts on endangered and threatened sea turtles; waste of incidentalcatch; bycatch of recreational fishes; disruption of migration, schooling,and spawning behavior; ghost fishing; habitat damage; displacement of traditionalfishermen and gear; navigation hazard; gear conflict; impact on ex-vesselprice; and lower quality of net caught fish. <T3>Response. </T3>As acknowledged in Amendment 3, many of these concernsover the use of drift gill nets are the subject of data which are eitherlimited, nonexistent, or conflicting. NOAA concurs with the Councils' interpretationand therefore concludes that the prohibition of net gear based solely onthese concerns, singularly or collectively, is not justified, particularlywhen alternatives for the reasonable regulation of the gear could resolvemany of these concerns. <ITAG tagnum="84">Changes From the Proposed Rule </ITAG>For the reasons indicated above, (1) prohibitions on the use of purse seines(andSection;andSection; 642.7(e) and 642.24(b)) and on the use of run-aroundgill nets (andSection;andSection; 642.7(y) and 642.24(a)(4)) to fish for Atlanticmigratory group king mackerel are not included in this final rule, (2)the allowance of 0.4 million pounds of Atlantic migratory group king mackerelthat may be harvested by purse seines (andSection; 642.21(a)(2)) is retained,and (3) the prohibition on the use of drift gill nets (andSection; 642.24(a)(3))is revised so that it applies only to Gulf migratory group king mackereland to the Gulf and Atlantic migratory groups of Spanish mackerel. <ITAG tagnum="84">Classification </ITAG>The Secretary of Commerce determined that the approved portion of Amendment3 is necessary for the conservation and management of the coastal migratorypelagic resources and that it is consistent with the Magnuson Act and otherapplicable law. The Under Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere, NOAA, determined that thisrule is not a ``major rule'' requiring a regulatory impact analysis underE.O. 12291. This rule is not likely to result in an annual effect on theeconomy of $100 million or more; a major increase in costs or prices forconsumers, individual industries, Federal, State, or local government agencies,or geographic regions; or a significant adverse effect on competition,employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or the ability of U.S.-basedenterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or exportmarkets. The Councils prepared a regulatory impact review for Amendment 3. A summaryof the economic effects was included in the proposed rule. Those effectsare significantly mitigated by partial disapproval of Amendment 3. An initial regulatory flexibility analysis_part of the Councils' regulatoryimpact review_concluded that the proposed rule, if adopted, would havesignificant effects on small entities. However, in disapproving parts ofAmendment 3, those effects have been substantially reduced. Indeed, becausedrift gill nets have not been used in the fishery for Gulf migratory groupof king mackerel and are not known to be used in the Spanish mackerel fisheries,the General Counsel of the Department of Commerce has certified to theSmall Business Administration that the rule implementing the partial approvalwill not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities. As a result, a final regulatory flexibility analysis wasnot prepared.The Councils determined that the proposed rule for implementing Amendment3 would be implemented in a manner that was consistent to the maximum extentpracticable with the approved coastal zone management programs of NorthCarolina, South Carolina, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana(Georgia and Texas do not have approved coastal zone management programs)and submitted their determination for review by the responsible State agenciesunder section 307 of the Coastal Zone Management Act. North Carolina, SouthCarolina, Florida, and Louisiana agreed with their determination. Alabamaand Mississippi did not comment within the statutory time period and, therefore,consistency is automatically implied. All measures implemented by thisfinal rule were encompassed within Amendment 3 as submitted. Therefore,the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA (Assistant Administrator)finds the determination of consistency remains applicable. The Councils prepared an environmental assessment (EA) for Amendment 3and, based on the EA, the Assistant Administrator concluded that therewill be no significant adverse impact on the human environment as a resultof this rule. This rule does not contain a collection-of-information requirement forpurposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act. This rule does not contain policies with federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a federalism assessment under E.O. 12612. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 642 </ITAG>Fisheries, Fishing.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: July 7, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James W.
