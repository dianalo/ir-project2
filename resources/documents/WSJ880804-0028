Dr. Lee Herron, vice president of product development for the pharmaceutical research company, said CytRx will begin testing of the drug, RheothRx Copolymer, at Emory University Medical Center in January. The drug will first be tested on healthy human beings to evaluate its safety, he said.    If the initial testing is successful, the company plans eventually to use RheothRx on patients undergoing coronary artery balloon angioplasty procedures, Dr. Herron said. </TEXT></DOC>
