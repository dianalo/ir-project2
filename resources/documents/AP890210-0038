Lisa Rawlins, director of the California Film Commission, saidshe had already mounted a campaign seeking waivers in 10anti-assault weapons bills before the state Legislature.   When the California Film Commission meets Wednesday inSacramento, Ms. Rawlins will seek official CFC endorsement of a moveto preserve the right to use or simulate use of assault weapons inentertainment programs. No opposition was anticipated, she said.   The first such waiver was contained in a Los Angeles city banapproved by the City Council and signed Wednesday by Mayor TomBradley.   The ordinance bans the sale of assault weapons and gives owners15 days to render such weapons inoperable or surrender them topolice. Violators face six months in jail and a fine of up to $1,000.   Originally, the law didn't specifically exclude the entertainmentindustry. But Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky revised the proposal at theurging of Charles Weisenberg, the city's director of Motion Pictureand Television Affairs.   ``An assault weapon may be maintained in the possession of anentity or establishment engaged in the business of motion picture,television or video production, but only for the purpose of beingutilized as a prop,'' the city ordinance states in part.   Ms. Rawlins told the industry newspaper Daily Variety she hadalready alerted the legislative unit of the state Department ofCommerce, which will be monitoring the proposed state bills andinduce their authors to offer proposals with industry exemptions.   In addition, she plans to enlist the aid of the California Leagueof Cities and the County Supervisors Association of California.   Los Angeles County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn plans to introduce acounty-wide anti-assault weapons law next week.   The rush to enact assault weapons bans and restrictions followslast month's Stockton shooting in which a gunman with an AK-47 riflekilled five youngsters.</TEXT></DOC>
