Within minutes, crews of a special, super-ready U.S. Army reaction force are in their M-1 tanks, racing to the border.    At least that's how they used to practice it. Now, when Capt. Pat Carroll simulates World War III, his tanks race less than three-quarters of a mile -- then stop for budgetary reasons.    After seven fat years of the Reagan administration, the U.S. Army in Europe has hit a lean one. The defense budget-cutters have slashed its training and operating accounts, creating a situation that is compounded by the decline in the dollar's value and the higher costs of running and fixing the Army's new high-technology weapons. The result: strange military maneuvers or, really, non-maneuvers.    &quot;I used to be able to roll them {the reaction force} any time I wanted,&quot; says Capt. Carroll, commanding officer of this hilly border outpost in Bavaria. &quot;Now the money says I can only roll them one klick {kilometer}.&quot; He worries how he will keep his men trained in map reading and battle maneuvers, skills they practiced during their runs to the border.    In nearby Bindlach, home of the First Squadron of the Second Army Cavalry Regiment, Capt. Carroll's commander, Lt. Col. William A. Barry III, wonders if the thumping 18% training-budget cut will affect his troops' morale. Shipments of expensive M-1A1 tanks, Bradley Fighting Vehicles, Blackhawk helicopters and High Mobility Multi-Wheeled Vehicles (successor to the Jeep) will still arrive, but higher fuel and maintenance costs mean his soldiers can't drive them around as much.    The cuts in front-line operations also will be difficult to explain to West Germans, some of whom see every budget decline as a sign that U.S. troops will eventually go home. Their nervousness hasn't been eased by signs from Washington that more budget cuts are coming. Indeed, the growing expense of supporting troops in Europe increases pressure in the U.S. to bring some or all of the troops home, or at least to make the Europeans shoulder more of the cost.    Construction will continue at Bindlach, a German fighter base in World War II. But maintenance of existing facilities is being cut back sharply as the number of German civilian employees dwindles. A new rule says three civilians must retire before one can be hired.    This is the way defense budgets shrink. Big-ticket items including hardware and construction tend to resist cuts, leaving day-to-day functions, such as operations and maintenance, more vulnerable to the long knives in Washington.    Col. Barry's squadron has priority on new weapons because it would be among the first units to use them if a war began. The squadron's mission is to block the most likely entry points for an armored invasion from the East. The training cuts mean &quot;acceptance of a lesser, but acceptable, readiness standard,&quot; he says.    Free housing and bargains at the base PX help protect most soldiers from the financial strain, but they create a life style largely confined to the base. &quot;The Little America Syndrome,&quot; the Army calls it.    If Spec. 4 Christopher D. Akaret, who is 21 years old, goes to nearby Bayreuth and has a Big Mac ($2.42) and then a beer at a discotheque ($2.66) and misses the bus back to the base, he has to take a taxi ($11). He can't afford many evenings like that, so he spends more of his leisure time in the barracks. &quot;A lot of us want to get out and meet some Germans,&quot; he says.    The relative poverty of American troops has led to some embarrassing situations. Last Christmas, for example, Col. Barry received a bouquet from the mayor of Bayreuth along with an envelope containing 2,000 German marks ($1,180) for needy U.S. troops and their families.    And Ortwin Lowack, campaigning to be the next mayor, wants to set up a program for German families to teach newly arrived U.S. Army dependants how to cope with the hazards of off-base living. &quot;We could do more than we do now to bring the troops and their families out of their isolation,&quot; he says.    The Army says the average U.S. soldier isn't ready for the new austerity. He or she arrives in Germany with $300 in debts. Only one out of 10 has enough money to live off base without taking out a loan. German creditors are hounding 31,461 U.S. soldiers in Germany -- three times the number a year ago.    Yet under the Army's latest budget, life on the base also will lose some of its zip. Bindlach tank gunners, men used to lobbing chest-high shells that obliterate distant targets, will train more frequently with a rifle-like gun attached to their firing system. A tank rumbles onto the range, its big 105mm gun swivels to the proper angle and then: pop. A small bullet makes a hole in a paper target.    There will be days when even that may be too much for Lt. Col. Robert Young, executive officer of the 4,500-man regiment. While his operating budget has been cut 14%, the cost of running an M-1 tank has jumped to $74 from $50 a mile. His new Bradley Fighting Vehicles cost three times as much to operate as the armored vehicles they replaced. &quot;Maneuver is the most expensive thing we do,&quot; he says.    Maj. Gen. Charles J. Fiala, U.S. Army chief of staff in Europe, has come up with a training philosophy to deal with the dilemma: &quot;Train Smarter.&quot; That means commanders should find more opportunities to take their men out of their tanks and helicopters and put them in video-game-like training simulators.    Gen. Fiala says the Army doesn't know what the new austerity will cost it in terms of readiness or morale problems. &quot;Soldiers say hey, the old way {driving and firing the tank} was more fun, but, so far, we've been able to retain high quality soldiers. That's why we'll be watching this very closely.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
