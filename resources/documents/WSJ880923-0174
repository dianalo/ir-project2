Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and his cabinet ministers announced yesterday that the government will make compensation payments totaling about 300 million Canadian dollars (US$246.6 million) to redress injustices to Japanese Canadians during World War II, when many were forced to leave their homes on the Pacific coast. It also will contribute C$150 million toward a proposed natural-gas pipeline between the Canadian mainland and Vancouver Island.    The Conservatives also formally served notice that they will use their big House of Commons majority to push through legislation Monday providing for C$4 billion in government spending on a child-care program over the next seven years.    In recent months the Mulroney government also has announced plans for large-scale spending on environmental cleanup projects, oil development ventures, AIDS research, drought relief for farmers and regional economic-development assistance.    The opposition Liberal Party said cabinet ministers made spending announcements totaling C$12.3 billion between May 20 and Sept. 9. Most of the spending would be over several years.    Canadian business groups and international agencies have been urging the federal government to curb its spending because of the government's sharply rising debt. Net federal government debt has risen to more than 40% of economic output, from about 16% in 1980.    The deficit declined C$2.5 billion in the year ended March 31, to C$28.1 billion, the third consecutive year it narrowed. But critics say the deficit should be much lower for a country in the sixth year of an economic expansion.    The deficit, however, ranks low among election issues. Mr. Mulroney is expected to call an election soon, possibly for late November. </TEXT></DOC>
