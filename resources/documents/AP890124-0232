Technical factors and profit-taking were mostly blamed forMonday's decline, which some analysts called an expected``correction'' following a recent strong rally fueled by confidencein OPEC's production-cutting pact.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the March contract for WestTexas Intermediate _ the benchmark grade of U.S. crude _ plunged$1.06 to settle Monday at $17.33 a barrel, near the low of the day.The February contract, which expired on Friday, had closed down 42cents at the end of the week.   Among refined contracts traded on the exchange Monday, Februaryhome heating oil settled 2.10 cents lower to 50.36 a gallon, afterlosing 1.15 cents on Friday.   The February contract for unleaded gasoline, which declined 0.32cent in Friday's session, settled Monday at 49.57 cents a gallon,down 2.08 cents.   The market started out on a down note, and prices continued todeteriorate as Monday's session wore on.   ``There were just waves of selling ... from everywhere today,''explained Peter Beutel, an energy analyst with Elders Futures Inc.``A lot of people had felt that a correction was long overdue, butthey just didn't want to get out.''   Beutel noted that since early October, West Texas Intermediatehad risen more than $7 to over $19 a barrel on optimism that theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would significantlycut its output to help shore up sagging worldwide prices.   A daily quota of 18.5 million barrels went into effect Jan. 1,and traders said there were indications that OPEC was sticking tothat level.   Bob Baker, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., saidhe didn't feel that the overall market confidence in OPEC'sagreement had changed. ``I really call it a technical correction toa substantial rise.''</TEXT></DOC>
