Attorney General Dick Thornburgh also told Congress that Bushwould veto the proposed civil rights bill. He said in a letter toSenate Republican Leader Bob Dole that changes put forth byHouse-Senate conferees ``do not offer substantial improvement'' and``in some respects they make the bill worse.''   Civil rights forces had hoped that changes adopted by theconferees in the job discrimination legislation would overcome Bushadministration fears that the bill would encourage employers toadopt hiring quotas to avoid lawsuits.   But the attorney general's letter made clear that the changeshad no effect on the Bush administration's position.   ``Accordingly, the president will be compelled to veto S 2104 inits current form,'' Thornburgh said in a letter released by theJustice Department.   Bush has said he wants to sign a civil rights bill this year.But Fitzwater said the White House will not accept the currentversion despite changes that Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins, D-Calif.,said backers hoped were ``more in line with the president'sviews.''   The key change would offer employers greater leeway in defendingagainst discrimination suits. It also would make clear that nothingin the bill was designed to encourage the use of hiring quotas.   But Thornburgh said ``the new language makes no materialchange'' in the bill, which Bush had previously threatened to veto.``The words are different, but the meaning and effect are the same,and there is no improvement.''   ``The trouble with the bill is not that it explicitly`encourages' or `requires' quotas, but that it will inevitablyresult in quotas being adopted surreptitiously to avoid the costand trouble'' of lawsuits, Thornburgh wrote.   ``The assertion that the bill ought not have this effect cannotchange the fact that it will,'' the attorney general said.   The legislation, the top legislative priority of the civilrights movement, would negate six Supreme Court decisions lastyear.   Main features would change complex courtroom procedures in a waythat would make it harder for employers to defend againstdiscrimination suits.   Other provisions range from a ban on racial harassment on thejob to removal of obstacles to reopening court-approved minorityhiring agreements.   Critics in the administration and the business community say thebill would make it so difficult for employers to win discriminationsuits that they would turn to hiring quotas as a way of heading offsuch charges.   A House-Senate conference committee that already had produced acompromise version of the bill went back to work Thursday night andadopted a seven-point package of concessions designed to win Bush'sbacking.   Supporters said that even if the president remains opposed, thechanges might attract the two-thirds congressional support for thebill needed to override his threatened veto.   The package was adopted 11-8 by the conference committee.   Rep. Craig Washington, D-Texas, a strong supporter of civilrights, voted with critics against the package. He said the changesturned the measure into ``the hollow shell of a civil rightsbill.''   Washington said long delays in sending the bill to the WhiteHouse most likely will enable Bush to stop the bill with a ``pocketveto'' if he so desires.   Under a pocket veto, the president is able to kill bills bysimply refusing to sign them when Congress is not in session.Lawmakers are getting ready to leave Washington for a round ofcampaigning before November elections.   ``I'm not criticizing them, they're senators and stuff,''Washington said, nodding toward Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.``But we could have done this three weeks ago.''   Hawkins, also a strong civil rights supporter, said it was timeto ``come up with something we hope is more in line with thepresident's views.''</TEXT></DOC>
