Kemble, Office of theGeneral Counsel, U.S. Department of Education, Room 4121, 400 MarylandAvenue SW., Washington, DC, 20202; (202) 732-2730.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>(a) The PFCRA reflects congressionalconcern about the large number of unchecked false and fraudulent claimsand statements that collectively are causing a substantial loss of Federalfunds and threatening the integrity of Federal programs. To prosecute smallercases in the courts costs the Federal Government more than it can recoverin criminal and civil penalties. Thus, it has not been practical for theGovernment to prosecute all these cases through the Federal court systemunder the applicable pre-existing civil and criminal statutes. The PFCRAis meant to remedy this situation. It does not create new types of violationsbut, instead, provides for administrative rather than judicial enforcementof the smaller cases, which is not as costly or time consuming.(b) On July 22, 1987 the Secretary published a notice of proposed rulemaking(NPRM) for this part in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, (52 FR 27650).(c) These final regulations make several substantive changes, includingthose made because of public comments on the NPRM. In addition, the regulationsmake a number of clarifying and editorial changes to the NPRM.<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Comments and Substantive Changes</ITAG>In response to the Secretary's invitation in the NPRM, three parties_oneof which represented a number of States_submitted comments on the proposedregulations. An analysis of the comments and of the substantive changesin the regulations since publication of the NPRM follows.Definitions. (Section 33.2)<T3>Comment:</T3> All three parties commented on the definitions section.Two of the parties_including the one representing a number of States_arguedthat the proposed definition of ``person'' went beyond the Act by includingStates, other public political entities, and Indian tribes.The commentersrecommended that the Secretary delete reference to these entities.The other party felt that the proposed definition of ``representative,''limiting that term to attorneys, was too restrictive and unfair to personswho could not afford an attorney. The commenter recommended that administrativelaw judges (ALJs) have the discretion to determine on a case-by-case basiswhether a non-attorney was qualified to be a representative.<T3>Discussion:</T3> With regard to the definition of ``person'', the Secretaryhas decided that the commenter has provided the better legal interpretation.As the commenter noted, the governing statute (31 U.S.C. 3801(a)(6)) containsa definition of ``person'' which does not mention States or other publicentities; and the legislative history does not reflect any Congressionalintent to include them. Under these circumstances, the executive branchshould not imply that Congress meant to cover States and other public entities.As to who might be qualified to serve as a representative, the governingstatute (31 U.S.C. 3808(g)(2)(F)) specifies that the Secretary shall byregulation promulgate procedures to permit any person alleged to be liablefor fraud under the Act to be ``represented by counsel or such other qualifiedrepresentative as the authority head may specify in such regulations.''The Secretary interprets this provision to require some regulatory standardsfor representatives other than attorneys. On further reflection, the Secretaryalso agrees with the commenter that the definition should permit a defendantwho might not be able to afford counsel to choose a non-attorney representative,provided that the defendant in making that choice appreciates the natureand serious consequences of a PFCRA proceeding.<T3>Changes:</T3> The Secretary has revised the definition of ``person''to delete States, other public political entities, and Indian tribes.The Secretary has revised the definition of ``representative'' to includea non-attorney designated in writing by a party, if the party certifiesthat he or she understands the nature of a PFCRA proceeding and its consequences,and understands the right to self-representation. See discussion belowof a corresponding change to andSection; 33.18, authorizing an ALJ to disqualifyan ineffective non-attorney representative.Default on Failure to File an Answer. (Section 33.10)<T3>Comment:</T3> One party had two comments regarding this section. Thefirst comment concerned the automatic imposition of the maximum penaltyand assessment allowed under the statute (that is, $5000, and, for a falseclaim, twice the amount of a claim on which the Government has made payment).The commenter asserted that the automatic penalty is not in keeping withthe statute and is too harsh because it could result in liability out ofproportion to the degree of wrongdoing. In this connection the commenterrecommended that the ALJ should be given the discretion to impose a penaltyin an amount that is related to the magnitude of the wrongdoing. The commenteralso criticized_as too vague and too harsh_the proposed requirement thatdefault judgment must be entered unless ``extraordinary circumstances''excuses the default (paragraphs (e), (f), and (j)). The commenter suggestedthat the regulations state a non-exclusive list of circumstances excusingdefault.<T3>Discussion:</T3> The regulations contain ample safeguards to protecta responsible person from default judgment and unfair penalties and assessments.The defendant is formally notified twice before a default judgment canbe imposed (andSection;andSection; 33.7; 33.10(b)). An additional safeguardresults from a change to the NPRM (andSection; 33.9), described elsewherein this preamble. The defendant also has an opportunity to demonstratethat extraordinary circumstances excuse a failure to file a timely answer;and the defendant may appeal to the Secretary an ALJ's decision denyinghis or her motion to reopen for extraordinary circumstances (andSection;33.10(f), (h)). There is also opportunity for settlement or compromisein appropriate cases at any stage of the enforcement process (andSection;33.46).The Congress has determined that $5,000, plus twice the amount of a paidclaim, is not in itself an excessive consequence for a willful false claim.The commenter's recommendation could put ALJs in the untenable positionof having to exercise discretion if a defendant has failed to produce therelevant information. The recommendation could also defeat the intent ofthe Congress by enabling a defendant to gain an advantage by willful default.With regard to circumstances that would excuse default, the regulationscontemplate excusing default only in unusual situations in which the defendant'sfailure to respond is unavoidable. All relevant surrounding factors wouldhave to be considered in determining this question. To attempt to enumeratea list of situations excusing default could be misleading. In addition to studying all public comments, and making appropriate changes,the Secretary has on review made other changes to the NPRM as follows:Definitions. (Section 33.2) <T3>Discussion:</T3> As it was written in the NPRM, the definition of theterm ``Reviewing official'' failed to include the condition stated in section3801(a)(8)(B) of the governing statute, that the ``Reviewing official''must be serving in a position for which the rate of basic pay is not lessthan the minimum rate of basic pay for grade GS-16 under the General Schedule.<T3>Change:</T3> The Secretary has added this condition to the regulatorydefinition. Answer. (Section 33.9) <T3>Discussion:</T3> The Secretary is concerned that, on occasion, a partymight lack sufficient time to file a detailed answer within the establishedperiod. If the party's inability to meet this deadline is based on a validreason, the Secretary feels that an extension may be warranted. <T3>Change:</T3> The Secretary has added to andSection;33.9 a new paragraph(c) giving a party that can demonstrate good cause an opportunity to filea general answer within the prescribed 30-day time limit and to file themore detailed answer within an additional 30 days. Authority of the ALJ. (Section 33.18) <T3>Comment:</T3> In connection with the definition of ``representative''(andSection;33.2), a commenter recommended that the definition should beexpanded to permit non-attorney representation and that ALJs have the discretionto determine on a case-by-case basis whether a non-attorney was qualifiedto be a representative. <T3>Discussion:</T3> The Secretary has expanded the definition of ``representative''(see <T3>``Definitions_andSection;33.2'',</T3> above). The PFCRA does not permitthe Secretary to permit the general standard as to who qualifies as a representativeto be decided by ALJs on a case-by-case basis. To do this would also imposean unwarranted affirmative burden on ALJs. The Secretary, however, believesthat it would be legally sound as well as practical and ethical to authorizean ALJ to disqualify a non-attorney representative who in the ALJ's judgmentis incapable of rendering reasonably effective assistance. The SupremeCourt defined the standard of reasonably effective assistance in the caseof <T3>Strickland</T3> v. <T3>Washington,</T3> 466 U.S. 668 (1984). <T3>Change:</T3> The Secretary has added a new paragraph (b)(2) to andSection;33.18,giving ALJs the authority to determine that a non-attorney representativeis incapable of rendering reasonably effective assistance, and to disqualifysuch a representative. Reconsideration of initial decisions. (Section 33.38) <T3>Discussion:</T3> As written in the NPRM, paragraph (f), read togetherwith andSection;33.39(b)(1), could have been read to preclude appeal by thedefendant to the Secretary during the pendency of a reconsideration motion.<T3>Change:</T3> The Secretary has revised paragraph (f) and added a newparagraph (g) to make it clear that the defendant may appeal an ALJ decisionto the Secretary at any time within during the prescribed time limit forappeal, regardless of whether or not a motion for reconsideration is made(see statement below with respect to ``Appeal to Department head'' (andSection;33.39)).Appeal to Department head. (Section andSection;33.39) <T3>Discussion:</T3> As it was previously written, paragraph (b)(1) couldhave been read to preclude appeal by the defendant of an ALJ decision duringthe pendency of a reconsideration motion. <T3>Change:</T3> The Secretary has revised paragraph (b)(1) to make itclear that a motion by the Department for reconsideration of an ALJ decisiondoes not preclude the defendant from appealing that decision to the Secretaryat any time during the prescribed time limit for appeal. However, a motionfor reconsideration automatically stays consideration of the appeal pendingresolution of the motion. <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 </ITAG>These regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order12291. They are not classified as major because they do not meet the criteriafor major regulations established by that order. <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 </ITAG>The regulations have been examined under the Paperwork Reduction Act of1980 and have been found to contain no information collection requirements.<ITAG tagnum="84">Educational Impact </ITAG>Based on a review of the rule-making record the Secretary has determinedthat the regulations in this document do not require transmission of informationthat is being gathered by or is available from any other agency or authorityof the United States. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 34 CFR Part 33 </ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Fraud, Investigations, Law enforcement,Lawyers, Penalties. <ITAG tagnum="20">(Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Number does not apply.)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: April 7, 1988. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William J.
