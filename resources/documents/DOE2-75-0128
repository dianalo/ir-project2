<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-75-0128 </DOCNO><TEXT>The advent of computed tomography (CT) in the early 1970s greatly facilitatedthe diagnosis and management of stroke and added significantly to ourunderstanding of the pathophysiologic brain alterations it causes inhumans. With CT it is now possible for the first time to noninvasivelyand reliably diagnose and distinguish between stroke resulting from cerebralinfraction and that resulting from cerebral hemorrhage. In addition,other brain lesions that at times may clinically present as stroke-likesyndromes, such as primary or metastatic brain tumor, brain abscess,or subdural hematoma, can usually be clearly differentiated by the CTexamination. In most instances it is no longer necessary to perform cerebralangiography to exclude a possible surgical lesion in patients in whomthe clinical diagnosis of stroke may have been in doubt.</TEXT></DOC>
