The changes are designed to improve the accessibilityof PRO-related policies, the fairness and firmness of PRO-recommended sanctionsimposed on providers and practitioners, and the effectiveness of PRO safeguardsfor beneficiary rights. Recommendation 89-2, Contracting Officers' Management of Disputes, urgessteps to increase the ability and authority of contracting officers toresolve contract disputes. Recommended steps include agency encouragementof the use of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) techniques by contractingofficers in resolving contract disputes and increased training of contractingofficers in ADR techniques. Recommendation 89-3, Conflict-of-Interest Requirements for Federal AdvisoryCommittees, urges Congress to establish special conflict-of-interest rulesfor members of federal advisory committees. First, the Conference recommendsa uniform minimal disclosure requirement for all advisory committee members,whether or not they are classified as special government employees. Second,the Conference recommends that agencies be required to determine whichof their advisory committee members are special government employees whenthey charter a committee, and it recommends new criteria for making thisdetermination. Recommendation 89-4, Asylum Adjudication Procedures, endorses the creationof a new Asylum Board, located within the Executive Office of ImmigrationReview (Department of Justice), which would consist of an adjudicationdivision, an appellate division, and a documentation center. These changesto the process for adjudicating asylum claims are intended to foster increasedexpertise and independence of the adjudicators and to assure fair and expeditiousadjudications. In Recommendation 89-5, Achieving Judicial Acceptance of Agency StatutoryInterpretations, the Conference recommends that agencies use certain procedureswhen they adopt interpretations of statutes that are intended to be definitiveon judicial review under the deference test set forth by the U.S. SupremeCourt in <T3>Chevron U.S.A. </T3>v.<T3> Natural Resources Defense Council,</T3> 467 U.S. 837 (1984). Recommendation 89-6, Public Financial Disclosure by Executive Branch Officials,calls upon Congress to review and amend the Ethics in Government Act'sexecutive branch public financial disclosure requirements, consistent withan appropriate balance of the benefits and costs of such disclosure. TheConference recommends lowering the threshold level for the reporting ofa covered individual's liabilities from the $10,000 to $1,000, which isthe current level for the reporting of assets. Other recommended changesinclude (1) reducing the number of categories of value for the reportingof an individual's assets and (2) requiring that gifts be reported in broadcategories of value instead of precise amounts. A Statement, Mass Decisionmaking Programs: The Alien Legalization Experience,describes the Immigration and Naturalization Services' implementation ofthe Alien Legalization Program authorized by the Immigration Reform andControl Act of 1986. The statement suggests improvements that can be madeby the INS in the remaining phases of the legalization program, and lessonsthat can be applied in future mass decisionmaking programs by the INS orby other agencies. The bylaw amendment authorizes the Chairman of the Conference, subjectto Council approval, to appoint special counsels to advise the Conferencein areas of their expertise. The amendment also specifies the privilegesof Conference senior fellows, special counsels and liaison members.

New andSection;andSection; 305.89-1 through 305.89-6 are added to Part 305,to read as follows: <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 305.89-1 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Peer Review and Sanctions in the Medicare Program (Recommendation89-1). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As the Administrative Conference noted in Recommendation 86-5 \1\<NOTE/>, the Medicare program relies heavily on implementation offederal requirements by localized carriers, intermediaries and, increasingly,peer review organizations (PROs). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ ACUS Recommendation 86-5, <T3>Medicare Appeals,</T3> 1 CFR 305.86-5. <ITAG tagnum="21">The PRO system was created in 1982. It is made up of state-wide, Physician-controlledorganizations under individual contracts with the Department of Healthand Human Services (HHS). These contracts are negotiated pursuant to ageneral contractual ``Scope-of-Work'' promulgated by HHS every three years.PROs are delegated a number of important responsibilities under the Medicaresystem. They identify substandard, unnecessary or inappropriate servicesrendered to Medicare beneficiaries, and oversee education and correctiveactions for substandard providers (e.g., hospitals) and medical practitioners.They also recommend to HHS that it sanction providers and practitionerswhen they find seriously improper practices, deny Medicare payment forinappropriate or unnecessary services, and protect the rights of beneficiaries.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This recommendation follows the suggestion made in Recommendation86-5 that the PRO program was deserving of further study. It recongnizesthe evolutionary nature of the PRO's role in Medicare, and the administrativedifficulties posed for HHS in overseeing this decentralized program_especiallysince new legislative directions affecting the program appear regularly,often contained in year-end omnibus budget reconciliation acts. Nevertheless,the Conference urges the Department (and, where necessary, Congress) tomake changes designed to improve the accessibility of PRO-related policies,the fairness and firmness of PRO sanctions imposed on providers and practitioners,and the effectiveness of PRO safeguards for beneficiary rights. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In Paragraph A of the Recommendation, the Conference urges severalenhancements of HHS' current practices in disseminating, making accessible,and soliciting comments on, PRO program guidelines of general applicability,including the scopes of work, manuals, and the criteria and norms usedto evaluate medical care. Paragraph B seeks to promote improvements inthe PRO's assigned duty of investigating complaints by beneficiaries, andurges Congress to allow PROs to act in response to oral complaints. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Paragraph C recommends invigorating the process of investigating andadjudicating sanctions against health care practitioners and providerscharged with violations of their obligations under the Medicare program.The current sanction process begins when a PRO gives formal notice to thepractioner or provider involved that it considers that poor quality caremay have been rendered or that other violations have occurred. The PROis required to have at least one quite formalized meeting with the practitioneror provider to discuss the allegations that the care rendered either ``failedin a substantial number of cases substantially to comply'' with the statutoryobligations to render proper medical care, or ``grossly and flagrantlyviolated such obligations in one or more instances.'' 42 U.S.C. andSection;1320c-5(b). (In the former type of case, at least two meetings are required.)If, after the meeting, the PRO believes that violations have occurred,it recommends to the HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) that a sanctionbe imposed, either in the form of an exclusion from participation in theMedicare program for some period of time, or a civil monetary penalty ofno more than the amount of the cost of medically improper or unnecessaryservices. If the OIG agrees that violations have occurred, and in additionfinds that the practitioner or provider is unwilling or unable to complywith the obligations to render proper care, the OIG may impose one of thesesanctions. If the sanction is exclusion, it becomes effective fifteen daysafter notice.\2\<NOTE/> The sanction is appealable to an ALJ, then to the AppealsCouncil; judicial review is subsequently available. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Certain practitioners in rural areas are permitted tohave the exclusion stayed, pending OIG proof that the practitioner wouldpose a ``serious risk'' to program beneficiaries if allowed to remain inthe program during the pendency of the administrative appeal. <ITAG tagnum="21">This recommendation seeks to balance the vital interest in protectingthe health and safety of program beneficiaries and the need to assure fairnessto the accused provider or practitioner whose livelihood is at stake andwhose services might be needed. The Conference urges that the current PROsanction process be streamlined. It also urges that all providers and practitioners,not just some, be permitted to seek a stay of an HHS order to exclude themfrom the Medicare program, in a proceeding akin to that of a temporaryrestraining order at the administrative law judge adjudication stage ofthat process. However, the burden would be on the practitioner or providerto show that no serious risk would be posed to beneficiaries during thependency of the administrative appeal. The Conference also urges changesthat, while maintaining the requirement that the OIG prove that violationshave occured, would eliminate the additional requirement of proving thatthe practitioner or provider is unwilling or unable to comply with theobligations to provide quality care. The offenses or oversights, whichhave been found both by peers (PROs) and regulators (OIG) to be substantialor gross and flagrant, already serve as indicators of inability or unwillingnessto comply. Under the current law, before excluding a provider or practitioneron the basis of these findings, the government must bear an additionalevidentiary burden that is inappropriate for this type of proceeding. Itmust prove what amounts to a speculative negative_that violators wouldbe unwilling or unable to comply with the law in the future. The apparentresult of this evidentiary requirement has been to chill the initiationof exclusion proceedings against providers and practitioners who are providingimproper care or otherwise violating the law. Further, the Conference recommendslegislative changes to provide for meaningful civil money penalties, aswell as for the current sanction of exluding providers and practitionersfrom the program. It should be noted that the Conference views the changesin the sanction procedure contained in this paragraph as a unified package,one that in its present form balances conflicting interests but that willbecome unbalanced if any one significant portion were not to be accepted.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Paragraph D urges changes in the PRO statute and regulations to ensurethat beneficiaries are better informed of their rights to appeal decisionsconcerning their lack of coverage or discharge from a hospital or otherfacility, and that they will not be discharged until such appeals are resolved.Paragraph E covers the PRO's role in denials of payment for care determinedto be unnecessary, substandard or rendered in an inappropriate setting.It recommends that HHS implement in final rules 1985 legislation concerningPRO denials for substandard care.\3\<NOTE/> It also urges HHS to amend its rules to require that PROsnot make any final decisions affecting payment without adequate reviewby medical practitioners who are qualified in the relevant area. Finally,Paragraph F urges HHS to take steps to permit PROs to share informationwith provider facilities and state medical boards. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ On January 18, 1989, HHS published a proposed rule coveringthis subject. 54 Fed. Reg. 1956. <ITAG tagnum="84">Recommendation </ITAG>A. <T3>Publication and Dissemination of PRO Program Guidelines.</T3> 1. HHSshould enhance its current practice of publishing and disseminating allPeer Review Organization (PRO) program rules having a substantial effecton providers, medical practitioners and beneficiaries by taking the followingsteps:(a) Notice-and-comment procedures should be used for rulemaking exceptwhen the agency for good cause finds that notice and public procedure thereonare impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.\4\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ See ACUS Recommendation 83-2, <T3>The ``Good Cause'' Exemption from APA Rulemaking Requirements,</T3>1 CFR andSection; 305.83-2. (b) Proposed PRO ``scopes of work'' and any generally applicable modificationsor interpretations of the responsibilities of PROs during a contract cycleshould be published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>and disseminated to relevant interest groups.Interested parties should be allowed 30-45 days of commenting, unless explicitCongressional deadlines would be contravened thereby, or unless there isgood cause for immediate implementation. (c) HHS should make PRO contracts, manual instructions, and other guidelinesof general applicability regarding the PRO program readily available tothe public at convenient locations, including social security offices.HHS should publish an updated list of such materials in the Federal Registerat least quarterly. 2. HHS should encourage PROs to use outreach and consensus-building techniquesanalogous to negotiated rulemaking when they are developing criteria andnorms for PRO review of the quality, necessity and appropriateness of medicalcare.\5\<NOTE/> HHS should further encourage PROs to make these criteriaand norms consistent nationwide. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ See ACUS Recommendations 82-4, 85-5, Procedures for NegotiatingProposed Regulations, 1 CFR andSection; 305.82-4, 85-5. B. <T3>PRO Investigations of Beneficiary Complaints.</T3> 1. Congress andHHS should coordinate the system of PRO review of beneficiary complaintsconcerning quality of services with other federal and state regulatoryschemes. Initially, priority consideration should be given to complaintinvestigations in the hospital setting, where PROs have the most expertiseand where alternative means to investigate complaints are least available.2. Congress should amend 42 U.S.C. 1320c-3(a)(14) to permit PROs to investigateand otherwise act on oral complaints concerning the quality of services.Until it does so, HHS should require PROs to receive such oral complaintsfrom beneficiaries or witnesses, and reduce them to writing, before actingon them. 3. HHS should require PROs to use investigative techniques that, so faras may be feasible, protect from disclosure the identity of complainantswho do not expressly and voluntarily consent to such disclosure. Wherethe identity of a complainant who desires anonymity cannot be kept confidential,the PRO should give the complainant the option of withdrawing the complaintin lieu of disclosure, although the PRO may at its discretion continueto investigate the underlying problem. 4. HHS should amend the PRO Scope of Work to conform to the 1986 OmnibusBudget Reconcilation Act by requiring PROs to inform beneficiaries fullyregarding the final disposition of all complaints, whether involving providersor practitioners. PROs also should be required promptly to inform providersand practitioners of the final disposition of investigations involvingthem. 5. HHS should establish guidelines and a significantly more expedited schedulethan the current several-month process for PROs to complete initial investigationsof complaints of potentially life-threatening quality deficiencies. HHSalso should establish procedures for receiving and acting on requests forintervention in cases where PROs do not process complaints on a timelybasis. C. <T3>Sanctions Against Providers or Practitioners Who Have Provided Improperor Unnecessary Services. </T3>Congress should streamline the sanction processby taking the following interrelated steps to promote heightened enforcement,while preserving fairness to the accused provider or practitioner.1. HHS should seek to ensure greater uniformity among PROs through trainingand the development of a model sanction referral form. To preserve neededhealthcare resources, HHS and the PROs should continue to emphasize educationand corrective action rather than sanctions as the primary means of addressingquality problems. HHS should also amend its rules (a) to require that,once a PRO determines that there is a quality problem for which a sanctionis the appropriate intervention, it immediately start the sanction process,and (b) to provide that, ordinarily, there will be only one formal meetingbetween the PRO and the accused provider or practitioner after the sanctionproceeding has been initiated.2. Congress should amend the PRO statute to offer all providers and practitioners(urban and rural), upon their receipt of an HHS notice of exclusion pursuantto 42 U.S.C. 1320c-5(b), the opportunity for a preliminary hearing anddecision. Such a proceeding would be conducted by an ALJ on the issue ofwhether the provider or practitioner would pose a serious risk to patientsduring the pendency of the subsequent ALJ proceeding on the merits of theexclusion. The preliminary hearing would be in the nature of a temporaryrestraining order proceeding, and would arise and be conducted accordingto the following procedures:(a) If, within 10 days of receipt of notice of the exclusion, the provideror practitioner appeals the decision of the HHS Office of Inspector General(OIG) imposing an exclusion, a preliminary hearing on the ``serious risk''issue should take place before the exclusion takes effect.(b) If the provider or practitioner establishes at the preliminary hearingthat continued participation in the Medicare program pending the ALJ'sdecision on the underlying appeal will not pose a serious risk to patients,or that such participation can be restricted to preclude such risk, theHHS exclusion order shall be stayed or modified by the ALJ until the ALJissues a final decision on the merits of the exclusion.(c) The ALJ must render the preliminary decision on the ``serious risk''issue as quickly as possible but within no more than 30 days after thefiling of the appeal, and a final decision on the exclusion within a timeperiod reflecting assignment of the highest priority to the adjudication.3. Congress should retain the requirement in 42 U.S.C. 1320c-5(b)(1) thatsanctions be based on determinations that a practitioner or provider haseither (A) ``failed in a substantial number of cases substantially to comply''with statutory obligations to render appropriate and quality care, or (B)``grossly and flagrantly violated such obligations in one or more instances.''However, Congress should eliminate the separate and additional requirementin 42 U.S.C. 1320c-5(b)(1) that the OIG must determine the provider's orpractitioner's ``unwillingness or lack of ability substantially to comply''with program obligations before imposing sanctions on the provider or practitioner.4. Currently the PRO statute [42 U.S.C. 1320c-5(b)(3)] limits monetarypenalties to ``the actual or estimated cost of * * * medically improperor unnecessary services.'' In order to provide for a wider range of sanctions,Congress should amend the PRO statute to allow the OIG to assess a substantialcivil money penalty for each violation against providers and practitionerswho are found to have grossly and flagrantly violated their obligationson one or more occasions, or to have substantially violated such obligationsin a substantial number of cases. The OIG should be given the discretionto impose such monetary penalties in addition to an exclusion where appropriate.5. HHS should assign PRO sanction cases to ALJs attached to the DepartmentalAppeals Board (who currently hear other sanction cases in the Department)rather than to Social Security ALJs, as is the current practice.D. <T3>Notice to Beneficiaries of Noncoverage. </T3>1. Congress should amend42 U.S.C. andSection; 1320c-3(e)(3) to assure that hospitalized beneficiarieswho appeal the hospital's notice of noncoverage by noon of the day followingreceipt of the notice, should not have such coverage discontinued untilthe PRO rules on their request for review.2. HHS should amend the PRO regulations to assure that, at the time a hospitalinforms beneficiaries of its decision to discharge them or of the discontinuanceof coverage, they are informed of their discharge appeal rights under thePRO program.3. The notice of a right to appeal should be on a form drafted by HHS (developedin consultation with beneficiary organizations and other interested parties),and should include a concise and easily understood statement of the basicbeneficiary right to a no-liability appeal to the PRO. If the current systemof separate appeal tracks (depending on whether the hospital and attendingphysician concur or not) is retained, separate notices should be givenfor each track to avoid the confusion caused by a notice that describesmultiple procedures.E. <T3>PRO Denials of Payment for Substandard or Unnecessary Care. </T3>1.HHS should proceed expeditiously to final rulemaking to implement PRO authority,contained in 42 U.S.C. andSection; 1320c-3(a)(2), to deny payment to practitionersor providers for care that does not meet professionally recognized standards.2. HHS should require by regulation that PROs not make final utilizationreview denials (denials of payment for care that has been determined tobe unnecessary or rendered in an inappropriate setting) until a proposeddenial and the response to it by the affected provider or practitionerhave been reviewed by at least one practitioner qualified by professionaltraining and experience relevant to the matters in controversy. AlthoughHHS should at a minimum apply the same standard to reviews of denials ofpayment for failure to meet professional standards of care, it may be appropriatein this context to require that the review be performed by a physicianpracticing in the same care specialty.F. <T3>PRO Sharing of Information. </T3>1. HHS should issue PRO manual instructionsand amend the Scope of Work in order to implement the Congressional mandaterequiring the sharing of information among the PROs and state medical boardsand licensing authorities regarding practitioners and providers who violatequality standards, and should modify its current confidentiality and disclosureregulations to require that a copy of any PRO final sanction recommendationbe provided to such bodies. HHS should explore the feasibility of includingsanction recommendations in the National Practitioner Data Bank.2. HHS should amend PRO regulations to require PROs to share with hospitalsinformation about confirmed violations of quality of care standards involvingdoctors on the staffs of such hospitals, including the contents of correctiveaction plans.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 305.89-2</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Contracting Officers' Management of Disputes (Recommendation 89-2).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">An increasing number of problems in the management of government contractsare now referred to lawyers, accountants, and judges for resolution. Thisaccelerating trend has tended to deemphasize the responsibility of theagency contracting officers, who (in most agencies) have traditionallyplayed a key role in the procurement process, including dispute handling.\1\<NOTE/> Many contracting officers (``COs'') today are subject torestrictive regulations and close oversight that can inhibit their willingnessto negotiate settlements. For this and other reasons, many cases proceedto needless litigation that are in fact susceptible to prompt, direct resolutionby COs at an early stage when parties are often less entrenched and morecongizant of program interests.\2\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Conference Recommendation 87-11, <T3>Alternatives for Resolving Government Contract Disputes, </T3>1 CFRandSection; 306.87-11, describes one aspect:<ITAG tagnum="28">``The dispute handling system established by the Contract DisputesAct begins with the contracting officer (``CO''), an agency official whosefunction is to enter into and administer government contracts. Any claimarising out of a contract is to be presented to the CO. The CO has a dualrole: to represent the government as a party to the contract, but alsoto make initial decisions on claims subject to certain procedural safeguards.If the dispute is not amicably resolved, the CDA requires the CO to issuea brief written decision stating his or her reasons.

It identified the decreased authorityof COs as a major factor contributing to the inefficiency and cost of resolvingmany conflicts. Recommendation 87-11 (in pertinent part) calls for (1)legislation, an executive order, by the Office of Federal Procurement Policy,policy statement, and Federal Acquisition Regulation changes to encourageCOs, before issuing a decision likely to be unacceptable to a claimant,to explore use of ADR to resolve their differences; (2) agency adoptionof policies encouraging ADR and regular use of rules or notices to alertCOs and other parties to ADR availability; (3) agency designation of anemployee to serve as an ADR specialist in connection with contract disputes;and (4) agency attention to the need to offer training in negotiation andother ADR skills to COs and others involved in contract disputes.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The instant recommendation seeks to go further to enhance the CO'sability and authority in the resolution of contract disputes. Calling forCO training in negotiation and dispute handling, as well as increased useof ADR techniques as part of a CO's decisionmaking process, it supplementsthe prior recommendation by focusing on the integration of consensual disputeresolution into already existing dispute and training systems at the COlevel, overcoming obstacles to ADR use, and practical guidance in improvingCO-level dispute resolution.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Recommendation</ITAG>1. Agencies with significant acquisition activity, acting in consultationwith expert groups, should encourage COs, and other key personnel involvedin the resolution of contract disputes, to make greater efforts routinelyto consider and utilize ADR to help resolve claims. Since dispute resolutionat the CO level is very much a shared activity, these persons may includeprogrm and project managers, attorneys, auditors, engineers, specialistsin pricing, packaging, production, maintenance and quality control, andother technical experts or contracting officials. These agencies shouldundertake comprehensive programs of promotion ADR at the CO level. Theprograms should include application of ADR techniques in specific testcases, conduct of training, case screening, and information and guidancefor personnel and contractors.2. Agency heads should direct senior officials within the acquisition hierarchyto act as proponents for dispute resolution, with the specific missionof developing more effective contact dispute resolution practices. Agencieswith extensive acquisition activity should designate a senior officialwithin the acquisition hierarchy with the specific mission of developingmore effective contract disputes resolution practices. This official'smission would include challenging barriers to wider ADR use, educatingdisputants in industry and government, and improving understanding anduse of ADR procedures at the CO level.3. The Federal Acquisition Regulation should be amended to describe specificallythe full range of dispute resolution methods available for considerationby the parties at or before the time a claim is presented to the CO forresolution under the Contract Disputes Act.4. COs involved in the disputes process should be specifically evaluated,as part of the annual performance evaluation cycle, on their effectivenessin managing contract disputes.5. In addition to those techniques set forth in Recommendation 87-11, agenciesshould be encouraged to use the following specific methods in CO-leveldisputes:(1) Employing factfinding to offer an advisory decision, or designatinga CO who was not involved in the disputed issues, or a particular distinguishedgovernment official or other knowledgeable person, to make an advisorydecision;(b) Employing minitrial or other processes to permit a structured presentationof facts and arguments to the CO or other government officer with authorityto settle;(c) Agreeing in advance that disputes arising under a particular contractwill be voluntarily submitted to an expert or panel for nonbinding opinionas soon as a disagreement occurs; and(d) Encouraging agency COs to employ the services of mediators or otherneutrals to enhance negotiations to settle contract disputes.6. Board of Contract Appeals judges should take greater advantage of opportunitiesto suggest returning to the CO cases which evidently should be pursuedmore vigorously for settlement.7. ADR training programs, for both industry and government personnel, shouldbe integrated into existing management training programs, as follows:(a) Training should focus on the use of these techniques as tools to improvethe contract formation and contract administration process, so as to abateconditions which later lead to disputes, and to expedite decisionmakingunder the Contract Disputes Act.(b) Training should reflect the fact that negotiation is a key disputeresolution method, and that most COs would become more effective professionalsby devoting increased training and attention to these methods. The FederalAcquisition Institute and other government entities specializing in acquisitiontraining should devote increased attention to listening and communicationsskills, use of ``interest'' and ``principled'' rather than ``positional''bargaining, and systematic attention to negotiation techniques. The trainingshould also enable a CO to engage in meaningful discussion with a contractorby first working as a ``team builder'' to develop a coherent intraagencyposition that takes into account the views and needs of attorneys, auditors,program managers, engineers and others within the agency. Consistent withbest management practice and the Packard Commission Report for greaterefficiency in procurement,\6\<NOTE/> the training should encourage the CO, even without the assistanceof a third-party neutral, to avert appeals by reducing the number of situationswhere disputes, encumbered by internal disagreements or incoherent positions,are passed on to boards of contract appeals.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ <T3>A Qutst for Excellence, </T3>Final Report by the President's Blue RibbonCommission on Defense Management (June 1986).(c) Professional organizations concerned with the public contract disputesprocess, such as the American Bar Association, Federal Bar Association,and National Contract Management Association, should develop and encourageincreased learning opportunities in effective dispute resolution techniquesfor representatives of the government and private sector.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 305.89-3</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Conflict-of-Interest Requirements for Federal Advisory Committees(Recommendations 89-3).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Law and practice regarding conflict-of-interest requirements forfederal advisory committee members have developed from the interactionof three statutory schemes: the Federal Advisory Committee Act,\1\<NOTE/> the conflict-of-interest laws, and the federal personnellaws. However, none of these statutory schemes was drafted to deal specificallywith conflict-of-interest standards for government advisers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ 5 U.S.C. App. I.<ITAG tagnum="21">In 1982 the Office of Government Ethics issued guidance to agenciesthat sought to meld a coherent analytical framework from the three statutoryschemes. In determining whether the conflict-of-interest laws applied,the Office distinguished between those advisers who were selected as committeemembers because of their individual qualifications, and were thus deemedto be special government employees (SGE's), and those who instead wereselected as representatives of nongovernmental groups or organizations(or in some cases, as independent contractors). While this guidance hasreduced the confusion somewhat, the determination of a committee member'sstatus as an SGE or a representative of a nongovernmental group or organizationremains difficult, and agency practice in classifying advisory committeemembers as SGE's or representatives varies greatly and often appears arbitary.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The classification of an advisory committee member as an SGE or arepresentative is significant because only the former are subject to theconflict-of-interest and financial disclosure laws. The most significantof these laws for advisory committee members is Section 208 of Title 18,United States Code, which makes it a criminal offense to participate ``personallyand substantially'' as a government employee ``through decision'', * ** recommendation, the rendering of advice, investigation, or otherwisein * * * any particular matter in which to his knowledge, he, his spouse,minor child, partner, organization * * * has a financial interest.'' Theterm ``particular matter'' in Section 208 has been interpreted broadlyby the Department of Justice and the Office of Government Ethics to extendto all discrete matters that are the subject of agency action, includingrulemaking and general policy matters.\2\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ The test of whether a financial interest exists with respectto the matter is whether the government action in which the employee participateswill have a ``direct and predictable effect'' on the entity in question.Participation in the presence of a known conflict constitutes a violationof Section 208, whether or not the employee's action furthers or is likelyto further his or her financial interest.<ITAG tagnum="21">Section 208 is especially a problem for advisory committee members.Often they have been selected precisely because they are especially wellqualified to provide advice concerning problems in a particular field inwhich they themselves may be active both professionally and financially.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Because of its breadth, Congress provided for agency waivers of Section208's prohibition, either by rule or on a case-by-case basis, where theappointing official makes a determination that the employee's interestis too remote or insubstantial to affect the integrity of his or her services.Agencies, however, may be unable or reluctant under current law to granta waiver where a financial interest is significant, even though the agencyconcludes that any bias arising from that interest will be offset throughcommittee balance, disclosure of the interest, or the individual's statusas only an adviser and not as a decisionmaker.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Faced with the specter of criminal liability and the limitations ofwaivers, or simply for administrative convenience, some agencies have adopteda policy of declaring most or all of their advisory committee members tobe interest group representatives, rather than SGE's, except in the clearestcases. Thus, in practice, agencies may be requiring too little disclosurefrom members who are not SGE's, while imposing significant burdens, principallypotential criminal liability, on those members who are SGE's.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In this recommendation the Conference urges the establishment of auniform minimal disclosure requirement for all advisory committee members,whether or not they are classified as SGE's.\3\<NOTE/> The recommendation seeks to balance the government's andthe public's need for information to evaluate potential conflicts of interestand the burden placed on the individual who agrees to serve on an advisorycommittee, frequently without pay.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ The Conference recognizes that advisory committee memberswho are classified as special government employees may be required to furnishfinancial information pursuant to regulations of the appointing agencyor the Office of Government Ethics. It is further noted that the Officeof Government Ethics has under consideration a proposed regulation governingfinancial disclosure for all government employees, including special governmentemployees.<ITAG tagnum="21">The Conference also recommends that Congress direct agencies to determine,when chartering or renewing the charter of an advisory committee, whetheror not the committee's responsibilities require indentifying its membersas special government employees for purposes of the conflict-of-interestlaws. The recommendation (andpara; 2) includes criteria for making this determination.This approach places the burden of foreseeing and preventing conflictsof interest on the agency that seeks an individual's services on an advisorycommittee, rather than on the individual asked to serve, as does relianceon andSection; 208 waivers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This recommendation does not extend to privately established advisorycommittees that are utilized for advice in particular matters because themembers of these committees are not appointed by a federal agency. Consequently,an agency's relationship with such committees must be considered on a <T3>ad hoc</T3> basis. Nevertheless, the Conference believes agencies shouldbe alert to possibilities for bias or self-interest in the advice of utilizedcommittees and, where appropriate, should request information respectingthe affiliations and interests of the members.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Recommendation</ITAG>1. <T3>Disclosure by Advisory Committee Members.</T3> (a) Congress shouldrequire that each individual selected to serve on a federal advisory committee,excluding a regular government employee, furnish to the agency or appointingauthority at the time of the appointment or designation_(1) The identity of the individual's principal employment;(2) A list of positions held (whether paid or unpaid) and any contractualrelationships for the performance of services with any corporation, company,firm, partnership or other business enterprise, any non-profit organization,any labor organization, or any educational or other institution whose activitiesor purposes may be (or may forseeably become) relevant to the purposesand functions of the advisory committee as determined by the agency orappointing authority and described in the committee charter;(3) The identity, but not value or amount, of any other sources of incomeor any interests in a trade or business, real estate, or other asset heldfor investment or production of income, exceeding $1,000 in value whichare relevant to the purposes and functions of the advisory committee asdetermined by the agency or appointing authority and described in the committeecharter;(b) Advisory committee members should be required to file updated disclosurereports annually.(c) The agency or appointing authority should make publicly available theinformation furnished pursuant to subparagraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) above.The financial information described in subparagraph (a)(3) should ordinarilybe held confidential unless the member consents to its release or the agencydetermines after consulting with the member that public disclosure is requiredin the public interest.2. <T3>Classification of Advisory Committee Members.</T3> Congress, by amendmentto the Federal Advisory Committee Act or other pertinent statute, shouldrequire that each agency determine, when chartering or renewing the charterof an advisory committee, whether its responsibilities are such as to requiresome or all of its members to be identified as special government employeesfor purposes of the conflict-of-interest laws. Congress should requirethe agency to consult with the Office of Government Ethics in making sucha determination, and it should direct the agency to be guided by the followingconsiderations_(a) Ordinarily, where an advisory committee is expected to provide adviceof a general nature from which no preference or advantage over others mightbe gained by a particular person or organization, the members of the committeeneed not be special government employees.(b) The members of an advisory committee which renders advice with respectto the agency's disposition of particular matters involving a specificparty or parties should be considered special government employees.(c) The principal consideration in classifying an advisory committee membershould be the nature of the committee's function rather than whether ornot the member receives compensation.3. <T3>Coverage.</T3> This recommendation applies to advisory committees whichare established and whose members are appointed or designated by the federalgovernment, and to advisory committees whose operations are funded by thegovernment.

It deserves reaffirmation and continuedcommitment. The asylum process, however, can also become a misused exceptionin the nation's immigration laws, especially in a time of improved transcontinentaltravel and communications. Two important public values thus come into conflictin the asylum program. On the one hand stands the promise of refuge tothe persecuted; on the other stands the demand for reasonable assuranceof national control over the entry of aliens. This tension becomes acutewhenever application numbers rise.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In the 1970s, the United States received approximately 2000 applicationsfor asylum each year. By 1988, that number had risen to approximately 60,000applications. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) projects100,000 applications in 1989. Government expenditures for coping with theincrease have risen rapidly, both for adjudication and for detaining orotherwise arranging to shelter and feed the applicants. But this is necessarilyonly a stopgap measure. It would be far more cost effective in the longrun to devote the resources necessary to improve asylum adjudication procedures.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Although it should be possible to distinguish qualified from unqualifiedasylum applicants and thereby both honor the humanitarian tradition andavoid misuse of the asylum provision, several factors hinder our abilityto do so. First, the ``well-founded fear of persecution'' standard, uponwhich asylum is based, is far from self-defining; there is no uniform understandingof its application to particular cases. Second, judgments about the relativerisks faced by asylum seekers upon return to their native countries areunavoidably affected by preconceptions about what conditions may be likein those countries. It may also be misleading to posit a sharp distinctionbetween economic migrants and political refugees. Asylum seekers representa spectrum of motivations, and many leave their home countries becauseof a mix of political and economic reasons. Third, the facts upon whichadjudication must rest are elusive, largely because they turn on conditionsin distant countries. Moreover, the individual applicant, often inarticulateand uneasy, may be the only available witness to the specific events thatunderlie the claim. Therefore, credibility determinations can be crucial,but they are complicated by barriers to effective crosscultural communication.Improvements in the system must make allowance for all these difficulties.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The central standard for determining whether an applicant will begranted asylum derives from the definition of ``refugee'' contained ina United Nations (UN) treaty, the 1951 Convention relating to the Statusof Refugees, amended by its 1967 Protocol. Under section 208 of the Immigrationand Nationality Act (INA), the Attorney General may, in his descretion,provide asylum to applicants who establish that they have a ``well-foundedfear of persecution'' in the home country because of race, religion, nationality,membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. Additionally,section 243(h) of the INA establishes a mandatory country-specific protectionwhich is known as <T3>nonrefoulement. </T3>Section 243(h) provides that the government maynot return an alien to a country where his ``life or freedom would be threatened''on any of the same five grounds. Under current administrative practice,the most important test has become the ``well-founded fear'' standard,because people granted asylum status are necessarily shielded against removalfrom the United States.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Historically, the United States has employed a mix of adversarialand nonadversarial procedures for deciding on asylum and <T3>nonrefoulement</T3> claims. Currently, ``walk-in'' claims are adjudicatedby examiners in the district offices of the INS after an essentially nonadversarialinterview. It typically lasts about twenty minutes as the interviewer reviewsthe application form (I-589) and the applicant's supporting information,and also prepares and issues work authorization papers (provided that theclaim is adjudged ``nonfrivolous''). The file is then sent to the StateDepartment for its advisory views. The applicant is given fifteen daysto respond to any recommendation by the State Department to deny the application.Subsequently, an INS examiner will review the file and issue a decision.This process may take eight months or more. Informal review of districtoffice decisions is provided by the Asylum Policy and Review Unit (APRU),a small office in the Department of Justice created in April 1987.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Denials in the district office are not appealable, but unsuccessfulapplicants may renew the application in adversarial exclusion or deportationproceedings before an immigration judge, who will consider the matter denovo. These judges are officials in the Executive Office of ImmigrationReview (EOIR), which is wholly separate from INS but is also a part ofthe Department of Justice. Aliens who do not file for asylum until suchproceedings have started have no access to the district office; they willbe heard only by an immigration judge. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The immigration judge's ruling on asylum is appealable to the Boardof Immigration Appeals (BIA), which is also located in EOIR. Appeals caneasily consume a year or more, largely because of delays in receiving transcriptsof immigration court hearings. No further administrative appeals are possibleat the instance of the applicant, but on rare occasions, cases are consideredby the Attorney General personally upon certification or referral. Judicialreview of individual asylum denials almost always occurs as part of thereview of exclusion or deportation orders under section 106 of the INA.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Administrative adjudication alone involves five distinct administrativeunits (the District Office, the State Department, APRU, the ImmigrationJudges, and BIA), only two of which see the applicant in person. This multiplicityof agencies spreads resources thin, resources that should be concentratedefficiently so as to improve the quality of the procedure and assure thatgenuine refugees are granted asylum. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Adjudication of an asylum claim through the various administrativeand judicial levels requires several months and often consumes years. Suchdelays increase the attraction for marginal applicants because applicantscan enjoy substantial benefits, including work authorization and freedomof movement, throughout the period their claim is pending. Deterrents suchas detention or limitations on work authorization could be used to minimizethis magnet effect. Those measures, however, carry substantial disadvantages.Primarily, they are indiscriminate in their impact and may fall most heavilyon genuine refugees who have already suffered greatly. These measures alsoentail higher costs for the federal government, especially when asylumclaims remain pending for lengthy periods. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Conference believes that fair but speedy conclusion of adjudication,leading either to a grant of asylum or to an enforceable removal order,is crucial to any healthy asylum adjudication system. This objective canbe promoted through attention to two elements. First, delay derives inpart from the point of two separate rounds of de novo consideration ofasylum claims. One unified initial asylum proceeding should be establishedinstead. (If the alien has other defenses to deportation or exclusion,those other defenses should continue to be heard by immigration judgesin contemporaneous and separate proceedings). Second, additional delayderives from the qualified right to counsel as specified by current statutesand regulations, which provide for counsel in exclusion or deportationcases ``at no expense to the government''. Because so many applicants areindigent, delays often result from the need to accommodate the schedulesof those attorneys who are willing to take the cases on a pro bono basis_aproblem that is compounded when applications increase in a particular geographiclocation. A healthy system of asylum adjudication must be able to schedulehearings expeditiously, even if pro bono counsel are not immediately availablein sufficient numbers. Fairness must be sought, therefore, through hearingprocedures, training, and monitoring that assure a special role for theadjudicator in developing a complete record when the applicant is not represented.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The conference also believes that a healthy asylum adjudication processmust foster the greatest possible accuracy as well as public confidencethat decisions are rigorous, professional, and unbiased. Reliance on aspecialized adjudicative board without routine reference of applicationsto the State Department would serve these ends and minimize any perceptionthat asylum decisions are influenced by political considerations. Additionally,arrangements must be made to provide the adjudicators with informationconcerning foreign country conditions that is as accurate and completeas possible, derived from a wide variety of sources, both to help dislodgeany preconceptions and to foster systematic expertise for use in developingthe record and making the ultimate judgment on the claim. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For several years the Department of Justice has been considering amendedasylum regulations that would serve many of these ends. A version proposedin August 1987 [52 Fed. Reg. 32552] would have established a specially-trainedcorps of adjudicators, responsible to the INS Central Office rather thanto the district directors, and it would have eliminated de novo reconsiderationof asylum claims by immigration judges. These regulations drew criticism,in part because of concern about the professionalism and independence ofthe adjudicators, and the Department responded with modified proposed regulationsin April 1988 [53 Fed. Reg. 11300] that retained the new corps of adjudicatorsbut also restored the availability of de novo consideration before theimmigration judges. Those regulations are still pending in the AttorneyGeneral's office and the Department has encouraged this study and analysis.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Recommendation </ITAG>The Attorney General should adopt regulations creating a new asylum adjudicationprocess that would eliminate much of the duplication and division of responsibilityassociated with the current complicated system. Resources should be appliedto enhance the professionalism, independence, and expertise of the adjudicators,and to assure fair and expeditious adjudications, so that genuine refugeesmay be speedily given a secure status and unqualified applicants, absentcircumstances which would allow them to remain in this country, may bepromptly deported. I. Creation of a New Asylum BoardThe Attorney General should create a new Asylum Board located, for administrativepurposes, within the Executive Office of Immigration Review (EOIR) of theDepartment of Justice and consisting of an adjudication division, an appellatedivision, and a documentation center. The chairperson of the Asylum Boardwould be responsible for administrative support and supervision of theoperation of all three units. A. <T3>The Adjudication Division</T3>_1. <T3>Jurisdiction. </T3>All claims for asylum under section 208 of the Immigrationand Nationality Act (INA) or withholding of deportation under INA section243(h) (hereinafter collectively ``asylum'' claims) should be heard exclusivelyby asylum adjudicators in the adjudication division of the Asylum Board.2. <T3>Nature of the asylum hearing. </T3>Asylum claim proceedings shouldbe recorded.\1\<NOTE/> The asylum adjudicator should be responsible for developinga complete record of the specific facts relating to the applicant's claim,including those which might support a grant of asylum and those which mightcast doubt on the claim or on the applicant's credibility. Care shouldbe taken to assure the service of skilled interpreters. The adjudicatorshould be responsible for most of the questioning, with a reasonable andadequate opportunity for additional questioning and entry of relevant information,including the presentation of witnesses, by the applicant and counsel.The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) should not be representedas an opposing party in the proceedings.\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The Administrative Conference recommends experimentationwith other methods for creating a record that would maintain flexibilitybut preserve objectivity, professionalism, and fairness to the applicant.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ The Administrative Conference takes no position on thepossible application of the Equal Access to Justice Act to asylum proceedings.3. <T3>Representation of applicants. </T3>Applicants should be encouragedto secure counsel (or a qualified nonattorney representative) to developthe initial claim and to provide representation during the asylum proceedings.Although reasonable accommodation should be provided for counsel to beobtained, proceedings should not be unduly delayed, because expeditiousinitial decisions are essential. 4. <T3>Use of official notice of country conditions. </T3>Asylum adjudicatorsshould develop substantial cumulative expertise regarding country conditions,to be used in developing the record, and should be responsible for posingilluminating questions to the applicant and other witnesses, for evaluatingevidence, and for reaching the ultimate determination about likely risksto the applicant upon return to the home country. The accepted standardsfor official notice, in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act,should govern use of such information. Ordinarily, these standards willsimply require an adequate statement of reasons for accepting or rejectingthe asylum claim, reflecting such expertise. In instances when specificand detailed facts developed from the documentation center or other sources(and not from information supplied by the applicant) appear to be crucial,the applicant should be given notice of intent to deny based on such information,along with an opportunity to offer information or argument in rebuttal.5. <T3>The adjudicators. </T3>Asylum adjudicators should be recruited fromamong attorneys possessing adjudicative skills and appropriate judgmentand temperament, with close attention given to those who are familiar withinternational relations and refugee affairs and who are sensitive to thedifficulties of cross-culture communication. Adjudicators should receivesalary, benefits, and guarantees of adjudicative independence equivalentto those of immigration judges, and they should be assigned no other enforcementor adjudication responsibilities. The adjudicators should be given thoroughand ongoing training, especially on techniques for fairly conducting thisspecialized type of proceeding and on conditions in those countries fromwhich a substantial number of asylum applications is received. If, alternatively,a separate Asylum Board is not created and the adjudication assignmentis given to immigration judges, then such judges should be assigned toa separate unit in EOIR. <T3>B. Appellate Division</T3>_1. <T3>Composition and functions. </T3>The appellate division of the AsylumBoard should consist of the chairperson and two additional members, assistedby staff attorneys and other support personnel. The division's principalresponsibilities should be to consider appeals filed by persons deniedasylum at the initial stage, in light of the administrative record compiledbefore an adjudicator, and such other information as the applicant maywish to submit or of which official notice may be taken. The division,however, should also monitor cases, and should have the authority to requirecertification to it of selected cases, either granting or denying asylum,in order to foster consistency, fairness, and political neutrality. Itwill thus absorb the principal functions now performed by the Asylum Policyand Review Unit. 2. <T3>Certification or referral to the Attorney General.</T3> The AttorneyGeneral should retain the authority to review decisions of the Asylum Board,upon formal certification or referral or <T3>sua sponte.</T3>3. <T3>Expeditious completion of appeals.</T3> A high priority should be placedon completing all asylum appeals expeditiously, preferably within threemonths of filing. The Department of Justice should ensure that transcripts,where required, are made from recorded hearings in a timely fashion.C. <T3>Documentation Center.</T3> A documentation center, staffed with regionalspecialists, should maintain current and detailed information on countryconditions, from both governmental and nongovernmental sources, periodicallycompile and publish usable summaries on selected countries, and respondto requests for more specific information received from officials of theAsylum Board. Special effort should be devoted to assuring complete compilationsof ongoing reports from established nongovernmental human rights organizations,and to drawing upon information from documentation centers in other countries.Information and procedures developed by other countries can be particularlyuseful in minimizing start-up costs. The center's collections and publicationsshall be accessible to the public.D. <T3>Role of the Department of State and the United Nations High Commissionerfor Refugees.</T3> The Department of Justice should take advantage of resources,assistance, and information available through the State Department andthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). In particular,arrangements should be made with both to assist in training adjudicatorsand to augment information available through the documentation center.If it so requests, on an across-the-board or country-specific basis, theState Department should receive notice of individual asylum applications,so that it may offer its judgment, in particular, about appropriate responsesin sensitive, such cases, as those involving foreign government officials.II. DetentionWhere detention of asylum seekers is deemed necessary,\3\<NOTE/> the Department should limit it to short-term detention in``asylum processing centers'', as recommended by the Select Commissionon Immigration and Refugee Policy. Such centers should also keep familiestogether wherever possible, minimize the length of detention, provide assistancein securing representation, and otherwise foster conditions which reflectthat the purpose of detention is not punitive.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ The Administrative Conference does not take a positionon the suitability of detention in asylum proceedings.III. DeportationThe Department of Justice should ensure that individuals denied asylumare removed promptly if they are otherwise excludable or deportable, subjectto any policy decision by the Attorney General to grant extended voluntarydeparture to nationals of particular countries.IV. Judicial ReviewJudicial review of asylum denials should be available as part of the reviewunder section 106 of the INA for orders of deportation or exclusion. Appropriatearrangements therefore should be made to combine, for purposes of judicialreview, the record of proceedings before the Asylum Board with that ofthe regular deportation or exclusion proceedings before the immigrationjudges and the Board of Immigration Appeals.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 305.89-5 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Achieving Judicial Acceptance of Agency Statutory Interpretations(Recommendation 89-5).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Agencies continually interpret the statutes they administer. Theirinterpretations are expressed in a great variety of formats_including,among others, legislative regulations, adjudicatory opinions, court briefs,interpretive rules, policy statements, staff instructions, correspondence,informal advice, press releases, guidance manuals, testimony before Congress,speeches, and internal memoranda. This recommendation addresses the relationshipbetween the procedures used by an agency in interpreting a statute andthe role of the courts in statutory interpretation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Interpretation of a statute presents a question of law, traditionallythe province of the judicial branch (see the scope of review provisionof the APA, 5 U.S.C. 706). However, for many years courts have accordedrespectful attention or even controlling effect to interpretations of statutesmade by the agencies that administer them. In some situations, in whichthe courts reserve the power to arrive independently at their own interpretations,they will give respectful consideration to an agency's construction butmay reject it, even if it seems reasonable. In other cases, courts considerthemselves bound to accept an agency's interpretation outright, providedonly that it is consistent with the statute and is reasonable. The lawgoverning judicial acceptance of agency statutory interpretations is nowdominated by <T3>Chevron U.S.A. </T3>v. <T3>Natural Resources Defense Council, </T3>467 U.S. 837 (1984). In thatcase, one involving legislative rulemaking, the Supreme Court laid outa general framework for reviewing agency interpretations of statutes. First,the court is to determine whether Congress has directly spoken to the precisequestion at issue. If the intent of Congress is clear, the court (likethe agency) must give effect to the congressional intent. Where Congress'intent is not clear, however, the court must determine whether the agency'sinterpretation is based on a reasonable construction of the statute. Chevronthus requires a reviewing court to accept an agency interpretation that(a) is not contrary to statute or specific statutory intent and (b) isreasonable.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">When an agency issues a legislative rule or interprets its statutein a formal adjudication, its interpretation of the statute it administersis entitled to judicial acceptance under the <T3>Chevron</T3> standard. Similarly, acceptance under the <T3>Chevron</T3> standard is appropriate if the reviewing court finds acongressional delegation of authority to make definitive interpretationsin an informal format such as the informal agency staff ruling involvedin <T3>Ford Motor Credit Co.</T3> v. <T3>Milhollin</T3>, 444 U.S. 555 (1980). But agencies rarely possess congressionallydelegated authority to make definitive interpretations, carrying the forceof law, by informal means. Thus, when an agency states its interpretationof a statute in an informal format, it should understand that courts ordinarilywill not be bound to accept such an interpretation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This is not to say that reviewing courts may ignore an agency interpretationset forth in an informal format. Numerous decisions of courts at all levelsindicate that the views of the agencies charged with responsibility foradministering a statute are accorded weight and may be highly influentialin shaping courts' decisions. In this way courts retain the advantage ofadministrative agencies' expertise and remain free to adopt agencies' interpretations,even though not required to do so.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Even when interpretations are expressed informally, however, agencieshave in some instances successfully asserted that these interpretationsshould be accepted as definitive by the courts, without consideration ofwhether the agency possesses the authority to make binding interpretationsin the format it has used.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">When an agency interprets a statute without using procedures authorizedby Congress for the development of definitive statutory interpretations,it should not expect that its interpretation will be entitled to judicialacceptance as definitive. Procedures so authorized by Congress, in almostall cases, will be relatively formal ones that ensure some level of publicparticipation and encourage reasoned and thoughtful decisionmaking by theagencies. However, this recommendation is not intended to discourage agenciesand their staffs from using informal means to keep the public apprisedof their views on questions of statutory interpretation. It is often usefuland appropriate for agencies to provide informal guidance of this type.The agency may reasonably expect that interpretations like these are entitledto such special consideration as their nature and the circumstances oftheir adoption warrant.

It thus takes no position concerningany other aspect of the <T3>Chevron</T3> standard.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Accordingly, the Administrative Conference recommends that the followingprocess be observed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Recommendation</ITAG>In developing an interpretation of a statute that is intended to be definitive,an agency should use procedures such as rulemaking, formal adjudication,or other procedures authorized by Congress for, and otherwise appropriateto, the development of definitive agency statutory interpretations.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 305.89-6 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Public Financial Disclosure by Executive Branch Officials (Recommendation89-6).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Public financial disclosure by federal officials is intended to makeit possible to monitor actual or potential conflicts of interest of suchofficials. This, in turn, may deter public officials from even consideringconduct that would present the appearance of a conflict of interest. However,these benefits of public financial disclosure must be balanced againstthe burdens imposed on the federal officials who are subject to them.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Determining appropriate public financial disclosure requirements requiresan assessment and accommodation of three concerns: the relevance of theinformation to conflicts of interest which might be faced by the individualin his or her official capacity; the practical burden faced by an individualwho must assemble and report information accurately (including whethera nominee or employee would reasonably be expected to have at hand theinformation which he or she is required to report); and the psychologicalburden imposed on an individual who must make his or her financial statuspublicly available to others (i.e., whether public disclosure constitutesan excessive invasion of privacy).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Administrative Conference has studied the Ethics in GovernmentAct's executive branch financial disclosure requirements (codified at 5U.S.C. 201-209) and in this recommendation urges Congress to make specificchanges to those requirements, consistent with an appropriate balance ofthe benefits and costs of such disclosure.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This recommendation is not made with the intention of generally requiringeither more or less disclosure of public officials. Rather, the Conference'sgoal is to rationalize the Ethics in Government Act's requirements andeliminate those that appear to bear no reasonable relationship to the Act'spurposes. On the one hand, the recommendation increases disclosure by reducingthe current threshold level for the reporting of a covered individual'sliabilities from $10,000 to $1,000, to be consistent with the current thresholdlevel of $1,000 for the reporting of assets (andpara; 2 b (1)). On the otherhand, the recommendation would lessen disclosure by reducing the numberof categories of value for the reporting of assets from the current sixto two, which the Conference believes is sufficient for conflict-of-interestanalysis and the maintenance of public confidence in the integrity of executivebranch officials (andpara; 2 b (2)).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Because the Act's executive branch financial disclosure provisionsare so detailed, this recommendation has been organized to clearly distinguishbetween current provisions that the Conference believes generally furtherthe Act's purposes and, therefore, should be retained, and those provisionsthat appear unnecessary to achieve the Act's purposes and, therefore, shouldbe eliminated or changed. However, in recommending the retention of particularprovisions, the Conference does not mean to imply that such provisionscannot be improved. To the contrary, the Conference urges the Congressto systematically review the coverage and language of all of the Act'spublic financial disclosure provisions, and to rewrite those that can bemade clearer and simpler.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">To illustrate, the Conference recommends continuation of the currentrequirement that nominees for positions covered by the Act report the sourceof all earned income in excess of $5,000 received by a reporting individualfrom one source in the two years preceding the year of filing (andpara; 2a(2)).However, the current statutory provision (5 U.S.C. 202(a)(6)(B)) requiresreporting of such compensation paid ``in any of the two calendar yearsprior to the calendar year during which the individual files his firstreport * * *.'' If strictly applied, a nominee who filed a report in Octoberof 1989 would be required to disclose such compensation for calendar years1987 and 1988, but not for the period in 1989 prior to his or her enteringgovernment service. This theoretical gap in coverage should be closed whetheror not in practice it has proven to be a problem.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The same statutory provision exempts from the ``over-$5,000 from onesource'' disclosure requirement the reporting of ``any information withrespect to any person for whom services were provided by any firm or associationof which such individual was a member, partner, or employee unless suchindividual was <T3>directly involved</T3> in the provision of such services.'' 5 U.S.C.202(a)(6)(B) (emphasis added). In redrafting this provision, Congress shouldconsider either defining the term ``directly involved'' or delegating tothe Office of Government Ethics the responsibility to clarify its meaningby regulation, especially as applied to individuals who provide servicesto others, such as lawyers. Therefore, although the Conference supportsthe retention of the substance of this and other of the Act's financialreporting provisions, it is clear that improvements to the language andcoverage can be made.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Because of its limited mandate,\1\<NOTE/> the Conference takes no position on the public financialdisclosure requirements applicable to legislative and judicial branch officials.However, the similarity of those requirements to executive branch requirementssuggests the desirability of reviewing and possibly amending legislativeand judicial branch requirements as well.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The Conference is authorized by statute to study and makerecommendations relating to administrative procedure used by administrativeagencies in carrying out administrative programs, 5 U.S.C. andSection;

New andSection; 310.14 is added to Part 310, to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 310.14</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Statement on mass decisionmaking programs: The alien legalizationexperience.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Alien Legalization Program, authorized under the Immigration Reformand Control Act of 1986, created a program to allow certain aliens presentillegally in the United States to convert their status to that of a legalresident. The program is administered by the Immigration and NaturalizationService and has a short and defined lifetime, which is heading toward completion.The legalization program contains two separate pieces: the ``section 245A''program, for aliens who have been in the country since January 1, 1982;and the ``special agricultural worker'' program, for alien farmworkerswho worked in specified agricultural employment for at least 90 days duringa specified period. The application period for the ``section 245A'' programran from May 5, 1987 through May 4, 1988. The application for the SAW programran from June 1, 1987 through November 30, 1988. Although the INS has actedon most of the cases, some are likely to remain pending for months. Moreover,as described below, the second phase of the process is still ongoing.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Administrative Conference has studied the INS's processing ofalien legalization applications from the standpoints of what improvementscan be made by the INS in the remaining phases of the legalization programitself, and what lessons can be applied in future mass decisionmaking programsby the INS or by other agencies. This Statement does not address the meritsof litigation over the regulatory ground rules of the program, but onlythe procedures for handling the applications themselves.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Description of the Process</ITAG>The Alien Legalization Program has been administered by the INS using aframework of local Legalization Offices (LOs) (107 of them across the country)and four Regional Processing Facilities (RPFs) to process the more thanthree million applications for legalization that were received. Applicationsare filed with the LOs, where interviews are conducted and recommendationsfor action are made. The files are then sent to a central processing centerin London, Kentucky, following which they are forwarded to one of the fourRPFs across the country. The RPFs make the determinations on the applications,based on the file material. Appeal of a denial of legalization status isavailable to the Legalization Appeals Unit (LAU) in Washington, D.C., andis based on the ``administrative record.'' 8 U.S.C. 1255a(f)(3)(B).The legalization process has two phases. The first phase is to determinewhether an applicant qualifies for legalization. The second phase, whichapplies only to qualified section 245A applicants, involves a determinationwhether they qualify for permanent resident alien status. (In the agriculturalprogram, permanent resident alien status is automatic.) The initial applicationperiod for both programs is now closed, and the INS has processed a largenumber, although not all, of those applications.The ``remote decisionmaking'' system employed in the Alien LegalizationProgram involves decisionmaking at the four RPFs rather than at local levels.This system has provided more consistency in decisions than other, moredecentralized systems within the INS. Having the determination made bya person removed from the individual who actually interviewed the applicantreduced the potential subjectivity of decisionmakers. Because interviewersat the local levels knew that their files would be examined in virtuallyevery case, the quality of work in the files has been relatively high.There are also suggestions that the system of regional facilities promotedcost-efficiency.The RPF remote decisionmaking system, however, has not been without problems.The elimination of direct contact between the decisionmaker and the applicant,which helps eliminate bias or prejudice, also eliminates the opportunityfor first-hand credibility determinations by the ultimate decisionmaker.The RPFs also have been very isolated from the public, making it difficultfor applicants or their representatives to acquire information about thestatus of cases, among other things. The RPFs have had only limited accessto legal advice from INS attorneys, requiring them in at least one facilityto seek advice from the LAU, which is the appellate unit that reviews appealsof their decisions. There have been some difficulties relating to the interactionbetween the LOs and the RPFs, and relating to the provision of adequatenotice to applicants at different stages of the program. There also hasbeen reported an unexpectedly high incidence of fraudulent applications,particularly in the agricultural worker program, which the RPFs were notequipped to handle.Overall, however, the system for deciding legalization applications appearsto be working fairly well. The results among the regions have been quiteconsistent so far. The INS has been able to process large numbers of theapplications, particularly in the first phase of the section 245A program.Moreover, the INS has recognized many of the problems, and taken stepsto address them.From the INS experience, it is possible to derive some lessons, not onlyfrom other INS programs in the future, but for other agencies that mayconsider using a system of remote decisionmaking for a large volume ofcases. There are also a number of lessons that can be drawn about the AlienLegalization Program in particular. While that program is nearing completion,to the extent that these comments refer to elements of the program thatare ongoing, the Conference encourages the INS to implement the suggestionsto the extent possible and to the extent that it has not already done so.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusions</ITAG>A. The Conference encourages agencies, including the INS, to consider usingremote decisionmaking where there is a large volume of cases to be decidedon the basis of objectively verifiable information within a written file,particularly where bias, prejudice or other subjectivity may be a significantproblem. This system appears to promote consistency among decisionmakers,perhaps because of the more centralized nature of the process, and thefact that it is easier for a small group of managers to confer on a regularbasis about the decisionmaking process. Agencies should, in implementingsuch a system, consider the following suggestions:1. In a remote decisionmaking system in which a file prepared on a locallevel will be the basis for decisionmaking, there must be clear guidelinesas to what are the necessary contents of the file, and the use of standardizedforms and checklists is encouraged.2. Where the local office is making a preliminary recommendation to theremote decisionmaking center, the local office should be instructed toprovide an explanation for its recommended decision that is sufficientto provide the remote center with the maximum benefit of the local office'sinformation and interaction with the applicant or other interested personwhose case is being determined (hereinafter ``applicant''). Appropriateforms or formats (e.g., computer entry) should be designed to ensure thatthe necessary information is transmitted in a uniform manner to assistin review and retrieval. 3. It is important that adequate information be available to the applicantsand their representatives concerning their cases. To facilitate this, casetracking systems capable of responding to inquiries should be developed.Applicants should be clearly informed of the process relating to theircases, and be given adequate notice of each step that requires or providesan opportunity for action or participation on their part.4. To avoid the appearance or actuality of conflict, it is important thatthe remote decisionmaking centers have adequate access to legal advicerelating to the merits of matters before them from agency legal staff otherthan from the appellate unit, if any, that reviews appeals of their decisions.5. Ensuring imput from local personnel on credibility issues is of particularimportance. It may be useful to consider ways of videotaping or otherwiserecording interviews where the applicant's credibility is at issue.6. Where helpful, the decisionmakers at remote decisionmaking centers shouldbe provided the opportunity to work for a short period of time at a localoffice, giving them first-hand experience in interviewing applicants, inorder to provide them a better sense of the implications of the informationthey receive.7. The remote decisionmaking centers' managers should consult with eachother regularly on substantive and procedural matters, in order to ensurethat their actions are consistent.8. It is important that the system be able to provide new or amended instructionsto the local offices quickly, so that consistency can be maintained andthe benefits of experience transmitted.B. With respect to the Alien Legalization Program specifically, the Conferenceencourages the INS to implement or continue to implement the followingsuggestions to the extent that they refer to elements of the program thatare ongoing:1. Action should be taken to ensure that information concerning individualapplications for legalization is readily available to the applicant orhis or her representative. INS should:(a) Establish a method of tracking cases that would enable applicants ortheir representatives to obtain information expeditiously concerning thestatus of their cases;(b) Ensure that applicants are clearly informed concerning all of the stepsrequired to complete the legalization process, both initially and as actionsare taken on their applications, particularly where further action on theirpart may be called for;(c) Recognize the need to extend completion times where applicants areunable to fulfill educational requirements due to a shortage of educationalfacilities or programs;(d) Supplement existing mail communication with applicants, including throughthe use of broadcast media. Particular attention should be paid to themobility of many applicants, as well as to the fact that applicants havenot always understood the multiple-step nature of the process, and thushave not realized that INS may be seeking to communicate with them.2. INS should ensure that RPFs have sufficient access to legal advice fromINS attorneys; however, the RPFs should not seek legal advice from theLegalization Appeals Unit (LAU), the office that reviews appeals of RPFdecisions.3. INS should consider making the following modifications in the way applicationsare processed by the Legalization Offices (LOs) and RPFs:(a) Including in the recommendation forms used by the LOs an additionaloption, ``recommended scrutiny'', in order to assure that the RPF reviewsthe application, without having to recommend denial for lack of anotheroption.(b) Arranging for the following in cases where fraud is suspected:(i) Reinterviewing applicants whose cases have not been decided; in thecase of SAW applicants, such interviews should be done by specially-traineddecisionmakers with knowledge of agriculture.(ii) Using video cameras to tape remaining interviews, in order to havea record on which credibility can be better assessed.(iii) Assigning remaining cases at the RPFs to specially trained teamsof decisionmakers; in the case of SAW applicants, such decisionmakers shouldbe trained to review agricultural cases and the types of fraud that mayappear in such cases.(c) Considering whether LO personnel should have more direct impact onlegalization decisions, since they are the ones who actually have the opportunityto assess the credibility of applicants.<ITAG tagnum="6">Michael W.
