Nevertheless, the Congressional Budget Office did acknowledge itsown forecasts show that rather than being ``revenue neutral'' thesweeping law will lose $23.4 billion during the same five-yearperiod ending in 1992.   Comparing other time periods shows a similar disagreement betweenthe administration's tax experts in the Treasury Department andthose of Congress, who work for the Congressional Budget Office andthe Joint Committee on Taxation.   The argument means nothing as far as reducing the deficit isconcerned, since the revenue figures are already built into thepresident's budget.   However, the disagreement is likely to make government officialsand the public think twice the next time they hear anyone attempt toestimate tax revenues far into the future.   Meanwhile, Joseph Wright Jr., Reagan's budget director, said hedid not expect the size of the revenue losses to be anywhere nearthe levels being estimated in the president's formal budget.   ``This is a static analysis done by the Treasury Department thatdoes not take into account any other influences on the economy. Itneeds to be taken with a grain of salt,'' Wright said.   He said the analysis failed to take into account faster economicgrowth that the administration contends is likely to occur inresponse to the reduction in tax rates.   Shortly after Congress passed the 1986 law, Treasury and theJoint Committee on Taxation estimated it would be essentiallyrevenue neutral _ lose only $300 million _ from 1987 through 1991.They forecast a sizable revenue increase in 1987, because taxpayerswould act to avoid a scheduled rise in the tax on capital gains;losses in 1988 and 1989, and then increases into the future.   At this time a year ago, Reagan proposed a budget that forecast a$23-billion drop in collections during the same five years. Thebudget that came out this week more than doubles that projecteddecline, to $48.5 billion for the period, and increases it to $90.9billion for the 1988-92 period.   In contrast, CBO says that because of the big 1987 boost, the lawwill increase collections by $4.6 billion in the 1987-1991 period,though it will result in an overall loss for the 1988-92 period.   The administration's latest forecast was included in the fiscal1990 budget that President Reagan sent to Congress on Monday. Duringthat 12-month period beginning Oct. 1, revenue will be $20.3 billionless than under the old law, Treasury says. CBO forecast a drop ofonly $700 million.   CBO expects the new law to produce more revenue each year thanthe old law starting in 1991 while the Treasury Department estimatescontinued declines, at least through 1993.   It was a different story in 1985 and 1986 when Congress and theadministration were putting the new law together.   Democrats wanted to ensure the overhauled law did not worsen thetreasury drain that they blmed principally on Reagan's 1981across-the-board tax cut. Republicans were fighting any revenueincrease, on grounds more taxes would simply lead to more spending.   The solution was to aim for a tax bill that was revenue neutral _that left the government with essentially the same money that theold law would have provided.   But, as the new figures seem to indicate, there is simply no wayto forecast how taxpayers will react to changes in the tax law threeor more years in the future.   Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., then chairman of the Senate FinanceCommittee and a prime author of the new law, recognized thedifficulty of such forecasts. On the day the Senate passed the finalversion of the bill, Packwood declared:   ``We have done everything we can to write it so that it will berevenue neutral. But, very frankly, when you are talking about abill that goes over five years, and we're going to be collectingroughly $4.7 trillion over that five years, you could hope it isneutral. Nobody can be absolutely sure.''   Forecasting tax revenues was made ever more difficult because the1986 law included the most changes since the income tax was enactedin 1913. In addition to cutting tax rates significantly forindividuals and corporations, the law reduced or repealed severaldeductions and credits and aimed to shift $120 billion of the taxburden from individuals to businesses over five years.</TEXT></DOC>
