Winthrop Financial Associates, Boston, will acquire thebuilding, designed by architect I.M. Pei, for $44 million.</LP><TEXT>   The savings and loan cleanup agency, the Resolution TrustCorp., put the building on the market last November. It neverhad high hopes of recovering the original $167 million cost;it had set the minimum bid price at $50 million, but nobidders met even that.   The tower, which came to symbolize the life style ofhigh-living Sandamp;L executives, includes a four-story spiralstaircase made of imported Italian marble, teak paneling,gold bathroom fixtures, gold-leaf ceilings, lifesize marblestatues by a reflecting pool and a bullet-proof chiefexecutive's office, to name just a few extras. &quot;We have afeeling that the building has an excess of finishes,&quot; an RTCspokesman said last fall, when the agency put the buildingout for bid.   The deal is among the first in which the agency offered a&quot;cash flow mortgage&quot; because traditional financing for realestate acquisitions has dried up. Under the plan, Winthropwill provide an initial $7.2 million in equity and will putan additional $12 million in escrow for tenant improvements.Winthrop and the RTC will share the cash flow from thebuilding for the duration of the 10-year mortgage. The splitwill vary, but the RTC will receive the largest portion, aspokesman said, and will share in the proceeds if thebuilding is sold.   The building is 49% leased, but Jeffrey Furber, vicepresident for Winthrop, said the company believes the Miamieconomy will improve. &quot;We'd like to think we are a valuebuyer,&quot; he said.</TEXT></DOC>
