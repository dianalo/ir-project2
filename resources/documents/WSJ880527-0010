Some meteorologists forecast half an inch to one inch of rain over Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri and northern Illinois on Monday and Tuesday. &quot;Speculators are getting nervous about the weather as we go into the long weekend,&quot; said Mario Balletto, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, New York.    Wheat futures prices were also depressed by the Agriculture Department's decision to reduce the amount of crop land that it requires wheat farmers to idle in order to qualify for government price supports. The move signals higher wheat production next year.    Most analysts had expected the department to require wheat farmers to idle about 15% of their crop land next year. However, the department said that it would require only 10% be set aside, down from the 27.5% that wheat growers had to idle this year.    Yesterday's session was the calmest in what has been one of the most volatile weeks in years at the Chicago Board of Trade. Conflicting weather forecasts yanked soybean futures prices down more than 20 cents a bushel Monday, then up the next day.    In trading at the Chicago Board of Trade yesterday, soybean contracts for July delivery closed at $7.54 a bushel, down five cents. The price drop was partly offset late in the session by heavy buying, which apparently was triggered when Candamp;D Commodities, a Chicago futures trading concern, bought futures contracts covering roughly three million bushels of soybeans, traders said.    Analysts said the drop in soybean prices also was cushioned by reports of increased buying of soybean meal. Some traders have worried that the big spring rally in soybean prices has pushed soybean meal prices to demand-damping levels.    In other commodity markets yesterday:   COCOA: Futures prices plunged. Rumors circulated in the cocoa trade that the Ivory Coast, the world's top cocoa producer, had become a seller after a two-month withdrawal from the market. July delivery cocoa ended with a loss of $89 a metric ton, at $1,596. One analyst emphasized that the reports remained unconfirmed and that details were lacking. He said that it was uncertain whether a buyer had approached the Ivory Coast and had purchased the cocoa at the Ivory Coast's price, which is well above the current market, or if the Ivory Coast had come into the market of its own accord to sell. &quot;There's a big difference if there was a small sale at a high price or a large sale at a low price, which would happen if the Ivory Coast came into the market,&quot; he said. The analyst added that there had been an accumulation of speculative buyers on the recent uptrend, based on price charts and somewhat tighter supplies that are immediately available. &quot;Apparently a significant number of them decided to take profits,&quot; he said.    PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices ended mixed after trading in a relatively narrow range. July delivery platinum rose $4.60 an ounce to $584.00, and July silver was up 1.5 cents an ounce to $6.66. June gold eased 70 cents an ounce to $454.10. According to one analyst, precious metals showed little response to an upward revision in the first-quarter gross national product because such an adjustment had been expected. Another analyst, however, said precious-metal traders paid more attention to another part of the GNP reporta downward revision in the price deflator to 1.7% from 2.4%. Traders concluded that change indicated a reduced potential for inflation. The deflator measures price changes in domestically produced goods and services but not imports.    COPPER: Futures prices rose on news about the strength of the national economy. July copper rose 1.05 cents a pound to 90.60 cents. An upward revision of the first-quarter gross national product prompted demand for contracts, one analyst said. According to this analyst, a major factor for the higher GNP was the drop in the March trade deficit because of strong U.S. exports. About two-thirds of the exports were manufactured products, which use metals, including copper, he said. In addition, he said, copper continues to be in good demand in the U.S. While supplies have improved, they're still relatively tight, as indicated by premiums that the nearby futures positions continue to command over more deferred contracts, he said.    ENERGY: Futures prices surged at the close, buoyed by bargain-seekers wanting to cover short positions. West Texas Intermediate for July delivery jumped 17 cents to close at $17.54 a barrel. Volume continued to be thin. Lackluster trading has predominated this week, but prices drifted low enough to prompt the last-minute buying spree yesterday. Most traders say the market's leadenness reflects anticipation of the Memorial Day weekend and the June 8 meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. </TEXT></DOC>
