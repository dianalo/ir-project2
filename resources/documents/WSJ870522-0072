The institutions were Lake Austin National Bank, Austin, Texas, which had assets of $42.5 million; Bank of Oak Grove, Oak Grove, La., which had assets of $23.3 million; and Texas Investment Bank, Houston, which had assets of $15.1 million.    Lake Austin National's office, closed yesterday by the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency, is to reopen today as a branch of Greater Texas Bank Southwest, also in Austin. Lake Austin National held deposits of $37 million in 4,300 accounts.    Bank of Oak Grove's two offices, closed yesterday by state banking authorities, are to reopen today as branches of West Carroll National Bank of Oak Grove, Oak Grove. The failed bank held $22.9 million in 4,800 deposit accounts and was the fourth bank to fail in Louisiana this year.    The FDIC arranged the transfer of Texas Investment's insured deposits to River Oaks Bank, also in Houston, because of difficulties in sorting out the failed bank's contingent liabilities. Texas Investment's office, closed yesterday by state banking authorities, won't reopen; deposits are to be available at River Oaks' office beginning today, the FDIC said.    Texas Investment held $13.4 million in 1,180 deposit accounts, including $54,000 in 17 accounts that exceeded the federal deposit insurance limit of $100,000 for each depositor. Owners of those deposits will share proportionately with the FDIC in the proceeds from the sale of the failed bank's assets.    Twenty-six Texas banks have failed this year. </TEXT></DOC>
