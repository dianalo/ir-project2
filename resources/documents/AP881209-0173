An Israeli officer and atleast eight guerrillas were killed.   Three Israeli soldiers and at least 16 guerrillas were wounded inthe battle across hills overlooking this coastal town, 50 milesnorth of the Israeli border and nine miles south of Beirut, Lebanesepolice and Israeli army spokesmen said.   Israel said at least 20 guerrillas were killed and dozenswounded. Lebanese police said at least eight were killed.   The operation ended when four Israeli troops who had beenseparated from the main force and surrounded by guerrillas wereplucked from the ground by two Cobra gunships and carried awayclinging to the struts, an Israeli officer said. A similar rescue in1986 saved the life of a downed Israeli pilot.   In Israel, army Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron said Israellaunched the raid against the Popular Front for the Liberation ofPalestine-General Command, a pro-Syrian group headed by AhmedJibril, to deter further attacks against Israel.   ``He (Jibril) prepares incidents all the time, and we saw a greatneed to attack his camp from where a great many incidents of thisorganization are planned and organized against us,'' Shomron told anews conference.   Israeli officials declined to say how many troops participated inthe raid, which began with a landing on bluffs east of Naameh ataround midnight.   An Israeli army spokesman said the troops maneuvered across oneto two miles of rough terrain on foot to the nearby guerrilla base,then penetrated it without being detected and fought hand-to-handbefore withdrawing.   The Israeli officer was killed during the assault on the camp,the spokesman said. An army communique identified him as Lt. Col.Amir Meital, 29, a commander of the elite Golani Brigade.   In Lebanon, a police spokesman said the Israeli unit was ambushedand surrounded shortly after landing. He said the Israelis respondedby dispatching commandos by sea, and its warplanes mounted 20sorties.   The hostilities were over by 11:15 a.m. (4:15 a.m. EST), shortlyafter two Israeli helicopters landed near an abandoned Maronitemonastery and evacuated the besieged troops, the spokesman said.   The operation marked Israel's deepest penetration into Lebanonsince it withdrew from the Chouf mountains southeast of Beirut inSeptember 1983, about a year after invading Lebanon in 1982. Israelwithdrew most of its troops from Lebanon in 1985.   Initial communiques released by Jibril's group claimed 18Israelis were captured. But later, Jibril acknowledged there were nocaptives, saying: ``The Israeli army has managed even to evacuatethe body of the killed officer as well as the three woundedsoldiers.''   Sitting at an impromptu news conference in a tunnel in thestricken area, Jibril displayed a U.S.-made M-16 rifle andbinoculars he said belonged to the dead Israeli officer.   An aide to Jibril, speaking on condition of anonymity, said theIsraelis had released several Doberman pinscher dogs fitted withtear-gas containers and explosives.   ``The dogs were trained to chase our fighters in the tunnels,when the Israelis would release the gas by remote control ordetonate the explosives to either force our fighters to leave thetunnels or kill them,'' he said.   ``Our fighters shot the dogs,'' he said, pointing to a dead blackDoberman with explosives and a gas container strapped around hisbelly.   The police spokesman said guerrillas and allied leftistmilitiamen opened fire at the Israeli jets and helicopter gunshipsfrom twin-barrelled anti-aircraft guns and launched severalshoulder-fired Sam-7 missiles. No hits were reported, he said.   Syrian soldiers in trucks and armored personnel carriers wereseen rolling south on the coastal highway when Israelireinforcements stormed ashore at Saadiyat, two miles south ofNaameh, the spokesman said. But he said there was no evidence of anySyrian-Israeli combat.   Distant thuds of explosions could be heard in Beirut as theplanes thundered through the blue Mediterranean sky to stageIsrael's 24th air raid on Lebanon this year.   At least 119 people were killed and 333 wounded in 23 previousIsraeli air raids on Lebanon since Jan. 3.   Black smoke and the stench of explosives shrouded Naameh and itsbluffs as the hostilities raged, and panicked residents deserted thetown for safer areas in Beirut and south Lebanon.   Many cars sped out, horns honking, from the stricken bluffs tothe coastal highway.   Lebanon's U.N. ambassador on Friday called for a Security Councilmeeting on Israel's raid. Ambassador M. Rachid Fakhoury made therequest in a letter to the Security Council.   There was no immediate response from U.N. officials.</TEXT></DOC>
