VERNACI</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Republican George Bush and Democrat MichaelDukakis leave New Hampshire today with a slight bump in theirdelegate totals that keeps them both on top in the race for theirparties' presidential nominations.   But the lift from the early primaries and caucuses is morepsychological than tangible as the candidates pursue the 1,139delegates needed to win the Republican presidential nomination orthe 2,082 delegates for the Democratic nomination.   Vice President Bush, who picked up 38 percent of the Republicanvote in Tuesday's primary, gained 11 of New Hampshire's 23delegates to the GOP National Convention. In all, Bush now has 61delegates.   Dukakis, who got 36 percent of the Democratic vote in theprimary, won 9 of the state's 18 pledged delegates to that nationalconvention. The Massachusetts governor has 44.5 delegates.   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas gained 7 delegatesin New Hampshire to bring his national total to 42, while Rep. JackKemp of New York won 3 delegates to raise his total to 35.   Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, the winner of last week'sIowa Democratic caucuses, gained 6 national convention delegatesfor his second-place showing in New Hampshire, and Sen. Paul Simonof Illinois followed with 3 delegates. In the popular vote in NewHampshire, Gephardt won 20 percent while Simon had 17 percent.   Gephardt now has 39 delegates, while Simon has 33.   Under Democratic Party rules, the national convention delegateswere awarded proportionally to candidates who receive at least 15percent of the vote. In effect, that disqualified Jesse Jackson,Sen. Albert Gore of Tennessee, former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbittand former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart from receiving any delegatesfrom New Hampshire.   Jackson won 8 percent of the vote, Gore 7 percent, Babbitt 5percent and Hart 4 percent.   New Hampshire Republicans have a similar rule, but the thresholdis 10 percent. That meant former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont, whohad 10.1 percent, picked up 2 delegates, but former televisionevangelist Pat Robertson, who was within 1,100 votes of du Pont,received no delegates because he had just 9.5 percent of the vote.   Robertson already had 8 delegates, while du Pont had none beforeTuesday's primary.   Among the Democrats, Gore already had 10.55 delegates, Jacksonhad 9.8 and Babbitt had 4.   The delegate totals for the Republicans include results fromMichigan, Kansas, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and Guam. AlthoughIowa and Hawaii both have held GOP caucuses, precise delegatefigures cannot be calculated until later because of the way theselection process is structured.   The Democratic totals include results from Iowa and NewHampshire, as well as an Associated Press survey of Democraticgovernors and Democratic National Committee members who will serveautomatically as delegates to their party's convention. Some of theDemocratic delegates cast fractions of votes at the convention.</TEXT></DOC>
