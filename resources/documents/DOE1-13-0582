<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-13-0582 </DOCNO><TEXT>Papers are presented on such topics as the energy enhancement of laserswith complex organic compounds; the generation of picosecond pulses withprogrammed parameters using new active laser media; low-threshold self-defocusingeffects in high-power lasers and radiation divergence; spatial-temporallight modulators; solid-state lasers with pumping by semiconductor light-emitters;and lasers with chromium-doped rare-earth garnet crystals. Considerationis also given to parametric amplifiers of nanosecond light pulses; photochemicallasers in the visible and UV ranges; the use of modified polymers inlaser optics; chemical lasers in the visible and near-IR ranges; trendsin fiber optics; and a tunable frequency GSGG:Cr(3+) laser with lamppumping.</TEXT></DOC>
