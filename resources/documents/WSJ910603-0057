What's more, the steps Mr. Bush is preparing to take areonly part of a larger pattern of much warmer U.S.-Sovietrelations about to unfold, including an almost-certainsuperpower summit in Moscow and some role for SovietPresident Mikhail Gorbachev at the seven-nation Westerneconomic summit in London next month.</LP><TEXT>   The economic package, which was outlined privately lastweek by Secretary of State James Baker to a visiting Sovieteconomic team, doesn't include any direct U.S. grants. But itwould feature two prizes of economic respectability theSoviets have pursued for 20 years: status as one of America'smost favored trading partners, and formal ties to theU.S.-dominated International Monetary Fund and the WorldBank.   In addition, the U.S. package would include stepped-up,large-scale American technical assistance to Moscow forconverting its defense plants to civilian use, for vastlyimproving Soviet oil drilling and for straightening out thetangled Soviet food-distribution system. This sort of advicehas been pledged before, but officials made it clear that ifMoscow's economic plan is improved, a huge U.S. advisoryeffort has been promised.   Also, the American overture is likely to include some formof the loan guarantees that Moscow has sought for grainpurchases. Skepticism about the credits among administrationeconomic officials has been eclipsed by President Bush'spersonal desire to find some way to help on the grain issue,despite doubts about Soviet credit-worthiness, officialssaid.   Over the weekend, the way was cleared for a Bush-Gorbachevsummit when Mr. Baker and his Soviet counterpart settled thelast disputes over implementing the treaty to reduceconventional arms in Europe. And administration officialssaid the U.S. now appears likely to support the idea ofinviting Mr. Gorbachev to London to meet with the leaders ofthe seven big industrial democracies that will be holdingtheir annual economic summit there.   The first, and most modest, step could be announced asearly as today, when Mr. Bush is expected to extend a partialwaiver of legal restrictions on trade in Soviet goods, theso-called Jackson-Vanik amendment.   The improved relations have been made possible byPresident Gorbachev's renewed public commitment to changethrough his alliance with the leading Soviet reform figure,Boris Yeltsin, president of the Russian republic.   Administration officials who met with the Sovieteconomists last week agreed that Moscow's plan still fallsshort of what's needed to produce a free-market economy. Butthey were impressed with the desire of the economic advisersto reach that goal, and their expressed willingness to amendthe plan to include U.S. suggestions.   &quot;If the Soviets start moving ahead with serious economicreforms, we will seek to support them with a package ofmeasures, including IMF special associate status, energydevelopment, defense conversion, and support of fooddistribution,&quot; Robert Zoellick, undersecretary of state foreconomic affairs, said in an interview. Mr. Zoellick has beenthe chief administration official dealing with Sovieteconomists, especially Grigory Yavklinsky, the mostreform-minded member of the Moscow delegation.   Michael Boskin, President Bush's chief economist, said theplan presented by the delegation last week showed that &quot;theirgoal is to get to a market economy. That much is clear. Theirprogram is evolving but it clearly has some distance to gobefore it is likely to be a potentially successful blueprintfor such a transition.&quot;   Significantly, Mr. Zoellick said, &quot;the Soviets made clearto us that they welcome our suggestions.&quot;   The U.S. wants to see the Soviet plan rely less on theKremlin's old-fashioned command structures to mandatechanges, and more on private initiatives. Mr. Zoellick, Mr.Boskin and other administration experts spent hours last weektrying to explain to the Soviet delegation that a freeeconomy can't be created by fiat from above.   In addition, the administration has cautioned Moscow thatany reform, and any Western aid accompanying it, must be astep-by-step proposition. And the U.S. officials stressedthat the Soviets shouldn't count on tens of billions ofdollars in Western aid. &quot;We're not talking about Biafra,&quot; Mr.Zoellick said. &quot;The Soviet Union is a country rich inresources and skilled people. It just needs to develop themarket mechanisms to tap them.&quot;   The administration officials also are trying to steer theSoviets away from the idea of a &quot;grand bargain,&quot; in whichsweeping changes are paid for by gigantic infusions ofWestern aid. &quot;The grand bargain is a dangerous illusion,&quot; Mr.Zoellick charged. He asserted that the West could pump inhuge sums only if the Soviets made foreign-policy concessionsthat would be unacceptable at home. Thus, he said, &quot;itfalsely raises expectations.&quot;   Instead, the Bush administration is prepared to offer morecarefully targeted assistance. The proposed special associatestatus at the IMF would give the Soviets access to a broadrange of international economic expertise to help them plottheir economic transformation. It also would give a clearinternational imprint to reforms, which might make themeasier for Mr. Gorbachev to sell at home.   The Soviets would gain most-favored-nation trade status inthe U.S., granting them low tariffs. And Mr. Bush willprobably forward last year's tentative U.S.-Soviet tradetreaty to the Senate for ratification. It had been held uppending Soviet passage of a free-emigration law, whichcleared the Soviet Parliament recently.   The administration would send U.S. energy experts to helpthe Soviets use modern technology to enhance oil recoveryfrom existing fields. Such steps would help the Soviets earnbadly needed hard currency. The U.S. also has suggested thatto avoid delays created by internal squabbles, the Sovietsmight place the proceeds into an escrow account to be dividedup after disputes between central and local governments areresolved.   In food distribution, a team that just returned fromstudying the poorly performing Soviet food system hasreported that some promising developments are under way toturn more of the food-distribution system over to privatehands. The U.S. would provide technical help to further thosetrends.   And to improve the conversion of Soviet defenseindustries, the Pentagon plans to send a team of experts inJuly, and is working with the Japanese government to send ajoint U.S.-Japanese team.   Prospects for a Bush-Gorbachev summit brightened over theweekend, when Mr. Baker and Soviet Foreign Minister AlexanderBessmertnykh settled the last U.S.-Soviet difference over theinterpretation of the conventional arms-control treaty signedin the fall. The Soviets had wanted to transfer some troopsand weapons into military units not covered by the pact, butgradually have agreed to compensating cuts elsewhere, thuspreserving the treaty's ceilings. In the latest compromise,Moscow agreed to convert certain armored personnel carriersso they can accommodate fewer troops.</TEXT></DOC>
