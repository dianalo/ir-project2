Although the PTT Nederlands will retain the sole charter forproviding the basic telecommunications infrastructure underground cabling,above-ground cabling, and basic satellite services, as well as all leasedlines-it must act as if it had competitors in these areas.andP;  And, in fact, ifa customer can prove that the Dutch PTT is not capable of providingcost-effective and efficient service, that cus- tomer may procure servicefrom another provider.andP;  All other telecommunications and data communicationsservices are open to competition.andP;  The personnel employed by the PTTNederlands are no longer civil servants, and Wim Dik, the PTT's chairman,reports that this has been a very painful corporate culture shift.andP;  He claimsthat a company-wide program to focus on quality has been very helpful.andM;The Deutsche BundesPost, still a civil service organization, expects to keepa very strong hold on even more of the basic telephone infrastructure thanthe Dutch, insisting on end-to-end control of the switched lines as well asof any ISDN networks and/or any satellite services used for voicetransmission.andP;  Although the regulatory functions are being removed from theBundesPost and passed on to an independent West German ministry, theBundesPost expects to own the voice network and also to provide the basicdata communications backbone.andP;  The German government is encouragingcompetition in the terminal equipment market, in mobile communications, andin satellite services for data (not voice) communica- tions.andM;The Belgian state-owned telecommunications company, RTT, seems the mostentrenched in advocacy of each nation's right to determine its own definitionof basic services that may be legitimately offered by a regulated monopoly.andO;The Belgians feel strongly that packet-switched data transport services(X.25), ISDN, and mobile communications should remain under monopoly.andO;(Belgium claims to need to keep mobile communications under monopoly due tothe small geography of its country and the limited bandwidth available.)andM;The French PTT shows no signs of being privatized nor of losing its civilservice mentality.andP;  And yet, the French have moved the furthest in broadeningtheir infrastructure from voice services to consumer-driven datacommunications by deploying the Minitel Videotex Service, which now offersover 14,700 different services through 4,000 different providers.andM;Jean-Pierre Chamoux, head of France's Ministry of Post, Telecommunicationsand Space, entered a plea for a new, competitive market of communicationsmiddlemen.andP;  Drawing an analogy to the network of independent insuranceagents, he pointed out that targeted providers of information services willultidmately serve the customers' best interests.andM;Of afl of the European Community countries, the United Kingdom has gone thefurthest in creating a competitive environment for domestic communication.andO;By allowing newcomer Mercury to compete with privatized British Telecom forthe provision of basic switched services, Sir Bryan Carsberg, directorgeneral of the United Kingdom's OFTEL (Office of Fair Trade forTelecommunications), has created a duopoly system.andP;  He claims that thisarrangement offers the optimal amount of competition without wreaking havocon the country's communications infrastructure.andP;  The United Kingdom has alsoopened up competition in all other areas of communications, from otherduopolies (in mobile communication) to six licensees in the satelliteservices arena to cellular communication, where there is very littleregulation.andP;  PRESERVING THE INFRASTRUCTURE.andP;  All of the countries representedat the two-day conference agreed that it is the national government'sresponsibility to provide an efficient and effective infrastructure for voiceand data communications.andP;  As you can see from the discussions above, manycountries differ on the most effective means to achieve that end.andP;  TheBritish reported minor hiccups in the quality of telecommunications serviceprovided after the privatization of British Telecommunications and the entryinto the duopoly of a second supplier.andP;  But Sir Bryan reports that, accordingto a recent survey, 83 percent of the citizens are either satisfied or highlysatisfied-the highest satisfaction ratings in the history of a country where,as Sir Bryan says, &quot;citizens are notoriously hard to please.&quot; THE CLOUT OFTHE EC.andP;  The European Commission (EC) has considerable muscle in policinggovernment monopolies.andP;  According to Sir Leon Brittan, vice president of theCommission of the European Community, which is responsible for competitiveand financial institutions, &quot;Article 90 of the Treaty of Rome obliges theCommission to monitor enterprises under state ownership or those in aprivileged position because they have been granted special or exclusive rights.'andM;According to Sir Leon: -The electronic exchange of information is going toform a much larger part of everyone's life by the end of the century.andP;  Forthat reason, if for no other, we have to ensure that the services involvedare provided as efficiently and effectively as possible.andP;  Whatever theprevious rationale behind the regulatory framework for telecoms, efficiencyand effectiveness in so large a part of our economy must be the watchwordsfrom now on.andP;  In practical terms, this means that, while recognizing thepublic service role of the telecommunica- tions industry, we need to ensurethe introduction of competition to increase efficiency and also to providethe user with choice.&quot; Liberalization Directives.andP;  The EC intends to pursueits goal of evolving Europe to a competitive communications marketplacethrough the use of Directives.andP;  The first, issued in May 1988, liberalizedthe rights for import, export, connections, and maintenance of terminalequipment, including modems.andP;  Countries will have until the end of June 1990to open up competition for  basic telephones.andM;The next Directive on Services, due to be published shortly, eliminates aflexclusive rights to telecommunications services except for voice telephony.andO;The preservation of special status for the voice infrastructure isrationalized by the EC's Sir Leon Britton this way: &quot;We have recognized thepublic service obligations imposed on telecommunications organizations, inparticular, the provision of a universal network and the obligation toconnect any user or provider of a service to the network within a reasonableperiod of time and at a reasonable cost.andP;  At present,financial resources forthe development of the network still derive mainly from the operation of thetelephone service.andP;  The immediate liberalization of the telephone service tocompetition could therefore jeopardize the financial sta- bility oftelecommunications organizations.&quot; But the European Commission reserves theright to monitor the situation and to reconsider the decision to exempt voiceservices from competition before 1992.andM;A number of countries wish to decide for themselves where to draw theinfrastructure fine.andP;  The general consensus seems to be that the state-ownedand/or state-regulated infrastructure should provide data communicationsservices (including leased lines, packet-switched X.25, and ISDN), whilecompetitors should be allowed to buy and resell these transports along withvalue-added services in competition with the PTTs themselves.andP;  The EuropeanCommission appears to be moving aggressively to draw the line at conventionalvoice services, although it will permit member countries to prohibit mereresale of capacity on leased lines (with no value added) for a &quot;shortperiod.' LONG-DISTANCE SUBSIDIES.andP;  Recognizing the need to restructure theircommunications pricing policies to prepare for competition, the West Germanswin be moving very aggressively.andP;  By 1991, the Deutsche BundesPost plans toreduce its prices for long-distance calls by 45 percent, and to increase theprices for local calls by 33 percent.andP;  This compares to the experience in theUnited States, where, over a five-year period (since divestiture), the priceof local calls has risen 48 percent, while the price for long distance callshas fallen 28 percent across the industry but 40 percent for ATandamp;T, accordingto ATandamp;T spokesman Sam Willcoxon, group executive for ATandamp;T's internationalbusiness.andP;  COMMON TARIFFS.andP;  While the debate is just beginning, Europeancountries will be encouraged to agree on common tariff structure foranalogous services across national boundaries.andP;  Although the EC makes thedistinction between agreement on tariffs and agreement on prices, which itdoes not favor, some member countries are concerned about the implications.andO;Neelie Smit-Kroes of the Netherlands Ministry of Transport and Public Welfaretakes exception to the commission's draft council Directive on Open NetworkProvision because it calls not only for free access to networks, but also for&quot;harmonization of contract conditions and prices,' which Mrs. Smit-Kroestakes as price-fixing.andP;  At this point, the Netherlands boasts low datacommunications prices, while West Germany's prices are much higher.andP;  Thisgives Holland a competitive advantage in attracting new businesses, anadvantage it intends to keep.andP;  COOPERATION.andP;  The European Commission has madeit clear that it approves of cooperation among PTTs for ventures such ascombined directory services and other joint activities.andP;  France Telecom andthe Deutsche BundesPost have combined forces in a joint venture, Eucomm,whose purpose is to create and develop vertically targeted, value-addedservices with partners.andP;  Eucomm's ownership is split 50/50 between the twooperating companies.andP;  It is capitilized at 80 million deutsche mark.andP;  The EChas also made it clear that its goal is to make the European computer andcommunications industry more competitive on a global basis, and that evenmergers among computer and communications companies will not be frowned uponas long as they do not stifle competition.andP;  For that reason, the EC recentlyOK'd the proposed takeover of Britain's GEC by Siemens and Plessey.andM;As Ferdinand Kuznick, managing director of Philips Telecommunications andData Systems (a joint venture with ATandamp;T), pointed out, Europe has spent $7billion on research and development in telecommunications, compared to $4billion spent by the Americans and $3 billion spent by the Japanese.andP;  Thereasons that Europe's Randamp;D costs are so high, he claims, are duplication ofeffort and the fact that all of the suppliers are competing for the same toptalent.andM;Like the Philips/ATandamp;T joint venture, there are many non-EC players teaming upto compete in the European market.andP;  In the United Kingdom alone, a number ofthe consortia that have won licenses to compete in sectors ranging from thecountry's new Telepoint service to its satellite services are from overseas-EDS, J.C.andP;  Penney, and Satellite Information Systems.andP;  Nynex and Bell Southhave active partnerships in the United Kingdom and France, respectively.andP;  Andthe most dramatic success story to date has been the merger between ITT andAlcatel.andP;  PARTNERING FOR THE 90s.andP;  Kuznick presented the most convincingpicture of the future global telecommunications landscape.andP;  He points outthat, due to the rising cost of Randamp;D in the communications arena, companiesthat could survive with 3 percent to 4 percent of the world market in 1980will need to own 10 percent by 1990, and 15 to 18 percent by the year 2000.andO;It therefore follows that there will be only five major technologiesworldwide by the year 2000.andP;  The current jockeying for position among themajor telecommunications suppliers is best understood, according to Kuznick,by considering the current combined market shares of the various alliedplayers.andP;  ATandamp;T, Italtel, and GTE's U.S.andP;  domestic business combine to make up33 percent of the current world market.andP;  Alcatel and ITT are in the secondplace with 24 percent Siemens combined with GTE's overseas business, coupledwith the Plessey/ GEC/Siemens merger, would constitute 17 percent of themarket, giving Siemens a lead in maintaining third place.andP;  Nothern Telecomand Ericsson both lie way behind with 8 percent each, and NEC and otherJapanese players combine to own 10 percent of the world market.andP;  DIGITIZINGTHE INFRASTRUCTURE.andP;  According to John Raisman, Deputy Chairman of BritishTelecom, the EC will be fully digital by the late 1990s.andP;  The Dutch PTT isdigitizing its network very quickly and, according to PT7 chairman Wim Dik,getting ready for broadband ISDN.andP;  Belgium is implementing narrowband ISDNtoday and preparing for broadband ISDN in the future, and is experimentingwith a broadband multiservice network integrating narrowband services andvideo communications services for both business and consumer applications.andO;ISDN.andP;  It is clear that ISDN will be a strong factor in the European market,not so much for the special services it permits (which, like most Americans,the Europeans can't quite visualize), but for its promise to rapidly convertthe network's infrastructure from analog to digital.andP;  As Fred Kuznick pointsout, the European infrastructure suffers from low signaling capacity.andO;Therefore, ISDN looks like a panacea to the PTTs.andP;  BEYOND ISDN.andP;  However,Kuznick painted a different scenario.andP;  He submits that Europe could go fromits current pre-ISDN phase to a superset of ISDN.andP;  He refers to this as aUniversal Information Service (UIS).andP;  It would, Kuznik claims, fullyintegrate the separate data and voice networks rather than just offerintegrated access.andP;  UIS would, in fact, provide complete integration ofvoice, data, image, and video signaling.andP;  It would enable digital broadbandto be provided on demand in an ad hoc fashion.andP;  Instead of the separatesignaling channels ISDN provides, channels would be fully integrated in theUniversal Information Service and, of course, full wideband capabilitieswould be supported, not just the 64 Kbps channels provided by ISDN.andP;  VISIONOF THE FUTURE.andP;  In order to piece together the European communicationsclimate of the 90s, one needs to look beyond the past monopolies and currentpolitical squabbles and to take into account the many factors affecting theEuropean landscape.andP;  CELLULAR TELEPHONY.andP;  The installed base of mobile phonesin Europe is 1.5 million-the same as in the United States-according to MikePinches, managing director of Orbitel Mobile Communications.andP;  But the realaction is in cellular phones, where the current growth rate in Europe is 100percent per year.andP;  European revenues for cellular telephony win be 2.7billion pounds sterling in 1989 with 1.8 million subscribers.andM;It appears dis there win be a single digital cellular standard for Europe,offering a common and compatible system with a potential market of 340million people.andP;  The standard is currently being formulated by the GroupSpeciale Mobile (GSM) of the Committee of the European PTTs (CEPT).andP;  At least16 countries are com- mitted to this service, and of those, five countries United Kingdom, France, Germany, Sweden, and Finland) will be offering commonproducts to this market on a competitive basis.andP;  The handsets will below-cost and ubiquitous, and Pinches predicts that demand will beunderestimated: &quot;The service will provide for international roamingthroughout Europe, the availability of compact portable equipment and also apersonal numbering concept through the introduction of SMART cards.andO;Estimates of the likely number of European subscribers to the GSM systemrange between 10 and 20 million by 1999, and the additional market outsideEurope may well add several million more.andP;  It is, however, clear that thereare no real prospects for the system in either the North American or Japanesemarkets.&quot;andM;The partners with Orbitel in the design and manufacture of this system areEricsson, Matra, ENSA, and Matshushita UK.andP;  They have completed thespecification and half of the design work, and are expecting field trials tobegin by mid- 1990.andP;  CORDLESS TELEPHONY.andP;  The kinds of cordless telephonesthat people use today in their homes, within a few meters of a telephoneoutlet, are being extended into public and office use.andP;  In the UnitedKingdom, there is now a 900 MHz digital standard (CT2) and a Common AirInterface (CAI) that have been established to ensure compatibility for publicapplications.andP;  In addition, the United Kingdom has issued four licenses tooperators of its new Telepoint service (the same service is called PoinTel inFrance).andP;  U.K.andP;  Telepoint service is slated to begin by the end of  89 orearly '90.andP;  The four licensees reflect the global nature of the competitionvying for entry into this market and the British government's commitment toencourage foreign competitors and consortia.andP;  They are: Ferranti; Philips/Barclays/Shell; STC/British Telecom/ France Telecom/Nynex; and Motorola/Shaye/MCL.andP;  Telepoint.andP;  The Telepoint service involves the establishment ofcalling stations in public places, like bus stops and public buildings.andO;Subscribers with their own personal portable handsets may place outgoingcalls as long as they are standing within 200 meters of a Telepoint outlet.andO;Mike Pinches points out that the distance may be more like 50 meters indowntown London at 4 p.m.andP;  on a Friday, when the stock exchange is closing.andM;The handsets are expected to weigh seven ounces and to retail for about 150pounds sterling.andP;  The cost per call is expected to be in the same range asthat of a public pay-phone.andP;  The Telepoint service is designed to handle the&quot;last mile&quot; market It is expected to draw from the domestic cordless phonemarket, the office cordless phone market, and the cost-conscious cellularmarket.andP;  The size of the Telepoint market in the United Kingdom is projectedto be about 10 million subscribers over the next 10 years.andP;  THE FUTURE.andO;Visionaries predict that the European communications services of the 90s willbe dominated by personal/portable mobile phones with a backbone network offiber optics and broadband ISDN or Universal Informa- tion Service.andP;  Butcable TV is also likely to play an increasingly large role.andP;  In theNetherlands, for example, over 80 percent of households are alreadycable-connected.andP;  So far, many of the European bodies that govern broadcasttelevision are distinct from those regulating telecommunications.andP;  Yet, it isclear that, with the advent of satellite services used increasingly for datacommunications, the two technologies and the regulatory policies coveringbroadcast, cable, and telecommunications will inevitably converge.andP;  It isequally clear that the European Community's next major task should be tobegin looking at broadcasting and telecommunications in an integrated way.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
