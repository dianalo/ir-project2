The unceremonious departure yesterday of Mr. Eastland, an outspoken conservative who for three years had been one of the attorney general's most trusted and influential aides, shocked even Meese loyalists, drew immediate fire from Capitol Hill and raised new questions about Mr. Meese's ability to continue running the beleaguered Justice Department.    Besides adding to the turmoil blocking many department initiatives, the move indicates steadily shrinking support for Mr. Meese and paves the way for further defections following the recent wave of high-level resignations in the agency. Within a few hours of the announcement, William Schambra, the attorney general's chief speechwriter, resigned, saying he was &quot;perplexed and deeply disturbed&quot; by Mr. Eastland's departure.    Moreover, the latest resignations are bound to boost continuing efforts by White House intimates, Republican Party officials, aides to Vice President George Bush and others trying to convince President Reagan that Mr. Meese has become a major political liability and should step down.    For his part, 38-year-old Mr. Eastland, while maintaining that &quot;I have been loyal to this attorney general,&quot; nevertheless acknowledged that given Mr. Meese's legal problems, &quot;it would be difficult for me to be as aggressive as (Mr. Meese) might like.&quot;    At a hastily called news conference that officials said wasn't cleared with the attorney general's office, Mr. Eastland said he was surprised and saddened. Mr. Eastland noted he, like the attorney general, has been worried that Mr. Meese's legal problems have diverted public attention from the agency's anti-drug campaign and other programs. But Mr. Eastland said &quot;I frankly don't know&quot; what finally prompted Mr. Meese to let him go. &quot;Let people perceive it how they wish.&quot;    In a two-page letter to Mr. Meese released yesterday, Mr. Eastland disclosed that he only found out about the attorney general's decision last Friday. &quot;You have expressed to me your desire to have (a chief spokesman) willing to aggressively defend you against, in effect, any and all criticism,&quot; the letter said. Mr. Eastland was given 30 days to look for a new job, but after a weekend of reflection, he wrote to his boss that &quot;I have decided that the most appropriate course of action&quot; was to leave immediately.    Mr. Eastland's friends and associates described the Friday meeting as a confrontation, in which Mr. Meese complained about the barrage of negative press stories about him and accused Mr. Eastland of failing to do enough to project a &quot;positive&quot; image for the department.    Mr. Eastland told reporters that the meeting lasted about 20 minutes, and was a &quot;very polite and civil discussion.&quot; He didn't specify Mr. Meese's complaints.    Asked about Mr. Eastland's dismissal, the attorney general told reporters that he &quot;decided this was a good time for a change in leadership,&quot; and that the former aide &quot;was agreeable to that.&quot;    Patrick Korten, Mr. Eastland's deputy who was appointed to head the office, suggested that his role is to more aggressively emphasize the department's progress against drug traffickers, as well as in other areas. Officials said that Mr. Meese, among other things, has considered hiring a private public relations firm to accomplish the same goal.    Calling Mr. Meese &quot;a very ethical man, a very moral man,&quot; the new spokesman said the attorney general &quot;deserves much better treatment&quot; from critics and the press &quot;than he's gotten in the past three years.&quot;    But Mr. Korten could face difficulties in his new job, because he may not be given full access to the attorney general's activities. Like his predecessor, Mr. Korten recently has been kept out of high-level management discussions at the department, including details of the Reagan administration's policy toward Panama.    Charles Cooper, the top Justice Department aide dealing with the Panamanian issue, months ago considered resigning because of concerns that the agency's morale, effectiveness and reputation have been damaged by Mr. Meese's problems, according to associates.    Critics from every part of the political spectrum expressed dismay and consternation. &quot;This is the worst judgment call the attorney general could have made,&quot; asserted Gary McDowell, a former top Justice Department aide and conservative spokesman who talked at length with Mr. Eastland yesterday.    Complaining that most of the agency's remaining leadership didn't get advance warning about the firing, Mr. McDowell described Mr. Eastland as a &quot;die-hard, old-fashioned conservative loyalist&quot; who &quot;has defended Mr. Meese aggressively and uncritically.&quot;    South Carolina Sen. Strom Thurmond, the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Mr. Eastland &quot;has a fine reputation and I was surprised to learn of his dismissal.&quot; And Sen. Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.), one of Mr. Meese's most outspoken liberal critics, asserted that &quot;Terry Eastland was about the only person left in Washington who was willing to defend the attorney general. He should have been given a medal.&quot;    Education Secretary William Bennett, who wrote a book in 1979 with Mr. Eastland, called him an &quot;excellent man&quot; and said &quot;he is welcome to join us here.&quot;    Another conservative, who previously worked for and remains sympathetic to Mr. Meese, nevertheless predicted: &quot;You're going to see cracks in the wall&quot; among Mr. Meese's remaining supporters, and heightened concern by Vice President Bush's staff because of the way Mr. Eastland was treated.    Mr. Eastland is credited with seeking out conservatives for judicial appointments, and for making Mr. Meese an important figure in championing a less expansive interpretation of the Constitution. While publicly defending Mr. Meese against all attacks, Mr. Eastland in the past few months has confided to friends an increasing concern about Mr. Meese's nagging legal problems.    He made it clear, for example, that he no longer would embrace the attorney general's position that all of the attacks against Mr. Meese were politically motivated, or the result of press exaggeration and &quot;hysteria.&quot;    Within the next month, independent counsel James McKay is expected to issue a report raising numerous questions about Mr. Meese's activities, and referring some issues for further review and possible sanctions by Reagan administration ethics officials. Mr. Eastland told reporters there was no way for him to be &quot;indifferent to what might be contained in, or flow from, the independent counsel's report.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
