Negotiations with the remaining six unions wereprogressing but were expected to continue through the earlyhours of this morning.</LP><TEXT>   As negotiations to save the ailing tabloid stretchedbeyond the midnight deadline, Mr. Maxwell emerged from thetalks with contract terms from some unions that would parethe paper's work force and restore management rights relatedto hiring to Mr. Maxwell.   Mr. Maxwell said that he expects 800 of the 2,300employees will lose their jobs. He declined to describe theterms reached so far with the unions. Mr. Maxwell, should henail down agreements with all the unions, still faces workingout final details of the purchase of the Daily News from itsChicago-based owner, Tribune Co. The terms agreed upon withthe unions so far need to be ratified by the unions'memberships.   Mr. Maxwell asked for many of the same deep concessionsthat the unions had fiercely opposed in going on strikeagainst the Tribune Co. paper. These included elimination ofabout 800 jobs, closing one of the three printing plants, andmore than $70 million of cuts in the annual operating budget.   Last week, Mr. Maxwell signed a tentative agreement underwhich Tribune Co. will give him $60 million -- about half ofwhat it would have cost the company to kill the paper -- fortaking over the Daily News and assuming what are estimated tobe at least $100 million in long-term liabilities, such asseverance and job guarantees.   In extending the deadline, Mr. Maxwell said all-nightnegotiations had failed to resolve issues of &quot;jobs, money andmanagement's right to manage, but good progress is beingmade.&quot;   Mr. Maxwell is the owner of Mirror Group, a closely heldcompany that publishes newspapers in Britain includingLondon's Daily Mirror, and an English-language European papercalled The European. The group also plans to launch TheRacing Times, a horse-track daily that would battlehead-to-head News Corp.'s Daily Racing Form.   Tribune Co. planned to close the 71-year-old tabloid onFriday if Mr. Maxwell couldn't reach an agreement with theunions or another buyer wasn't found. Nine of the News's 10unions have been on strike since Oct. 25.   The strike pushed losses at the Daily News beyond $100million in the past year, while its circulation plunged morethan 50% from its pre-strike level of 1.1 million copiesdaily. Calling itself &quot;New York's Hometown Paper,&quot; the DailyNews was once the country's largest metropolitan daily.</TEXT></DOC>
