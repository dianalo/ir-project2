Mother Teresa, who in 1948 formed the Missionaries of Charity,an order with nearly 3,000 members worldwide, also asked theaudience of 6,000 people to ``share the joy of loving with eachother'' by giving possessions to the needy.   ``By just giving of your abundance you don't feel the joy ofsharing, so give until it hurts,'' the 78-year-old Roman Catholicnun said. ``This is the joy of loving.''   The 1979 Nobel Peace Prize winner, who has served theimpoverished people of 71 countries since resigning as principal ofa Calcutta, India, convent high school in 1931, received anhonorary doctorate of humane letters.</TEXT></DOC>
