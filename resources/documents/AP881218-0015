SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Everybody complains about the weather, but somewant to know more than just why it rained on their parade.   They wonder where it's most likely to snow in November, when acold front froze pipes in Kentucky or where cars are most likely torust.   The answers are often available from the federal government,which has been collecting weather information for more than acentury.   Millions and millions of weather facts are stored in the archivesof the National Climatic Data Center, the climate-watching divisionof the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.   Requests continually pour in to the center's offices inAsheville, N.C., ranging from youngsters asking for ``everything''about the weather to specific information needed by lawyers andprofessors, engineers and manufacturers, utilities and airlines, carmakers and farmers, members of Congress and Naval officers,architects and designers, elderly people looking for warm retirementhomes and contractors who want to build them.   Columbus, Ohio, for example, called on the data center fordetailed weather information to help support its bid to host trialsfor the 1992 Olympic marathon.   A company planning to shoot a television commercial wanted toknow where it could find lots of snow in November. Therecommendation: Stampede Pass, Wash., in the Cascade Mountains.   Lawyers investigating the May 3, 1988, fire that gutted part ofthe First Interstate Building in Los Angeles requested hour-by-hourweather data for that date.   A Kentucky company charged with polluting a stream near anational park claimed the chemical spill was caused by a sudden coldfront that froze pipes. The center provided statistics to helpsettle the question.   And a consultant for the automotive industry collected extensivetemperature and precipitation data for cities across the country, inan effort to determine areas with the most weather-induced rust.   Phone calls, letters and electronic queries totaled some 73,000requests for information during the past year, said Rex Snodgrass ofthe data center.   Nearly one-third of the requests come from lawyers, Snodgrasssaid in a telephone interview.   Some records at the center go back to Benjamin Franklin, anddetailed data extend well into the last century, said Snodgrass.   Simple questions are usually answered on the phone, he said, butcustomers who need something more have to pay for the researchrequired. Regular customers set up accounts, others can use checksor credit cards.   The data center publishes a variety of reports and pamphletscompiling information collected by the National Weather Service andits thousands of volunteer weather observers nationwide.   Customers can get reports of hourly weather observations athundreds of locations, upper air weather measurements taken twice aday at many places, radar observations, satellite data, hourlyreports of radiation from the sun and a wide array of otherinformation.   For example, the popular television show Hollywood Squaresdecided to include questions about major U.S. floods in its quizzes,so researchers called the data center for information.   One freelance writer recently requested detailed weatherinformation for the Trenton, N.J., area for Oct. 30, 1938 _ the dateand place of Orson Welles' famous ``War of the Worlds'' radio showabout an invasion from Mars.   Another writer preparing a history of the last flight of AmeliaEarhart requested weather data in order to help calculate fuelconsumption of the missing airplane.   The drought last summer generated interest from news media andthe public, of course, with many farmers seeking detailed rainfallrecords for their areas to support of drought insurance claims.   Others in agriculture use the center too. For example, aCalifornia company choosing a location for a new strawberry farmrequested freeze-frost data for several northern Californialocations.   A Florida farmer wants to expand his Chinese cabbage farm but islooking for land in South Carolina which is less costly, if theclimate will permit his crop to grow there.   A Georgia tree farm is using temperature data to determine whenthe flathead apple borer will likely emerge and can be sprayed.Farmers battling the moisture-sensitive southern pine beetle alsohave been using rainfall records from the center.   Government data users include the Navy, which is compiling anatlas of weekly ice conditions in cold regions, a Senate committeestudying the theory of greenhouse climate warming, post officeofficials testing new mail sorting machines that may be sensitive toheat and even Border Patrol officials looking at how weather affectsdrug smugglers.   When needles and other used medical supplies began washing up onbeaches this past summer, the center assisted the New YorkDepartment of Environmental Conservation by providing tide and winddata to help trace the source of the materials.   Other requests during the past year included temperature andsnowfall data for a developer considering building a ski resort inthe Smokey Mountains, wind information for planners of a regatta inFlorida, visibility data for a company that wants to build a tallbuilding near the Cleveland airport and rainfall information for anAudubon Society project studying acid rain.</TEXT></DOC>
