April 3   Carlsbad (N.M.) Current-Argus on the Alaska oil spill:   With 10 million gallons of crude oil threatening wildlife andfouling the pristine beauty of Alaska's Prince William Sound, theoil industry's repeated assurances that it can protect theenvironment assume a particularly hollow ring. ...   In Washington, the repercussions of the oil spill will be feltfor months ... as environmentalists fight to keep oil developersout of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.   President ... Bush favors exploratory drilling in the refuge ifit can be done without harming the environment.   It is estimated that the coastal strip could produce as much as3.2 billion barrels of oil and keep the Alaska pipeline working atfull spate long after the North Slope oilfields have been exhausted.   If Congress is to approve such development, however, the oilindustry must demonstrate renewed dedication to legitimateenvironmental concerns. ...   One Prince William Sound disaster is one too many.</TEXT><TEXT>   April 3   El Paso (Texas) Herald-Post on drug testing for transportationpersonnel:   The Coast Guard says that Capt. Joseph Hazelwood, skipper of theill-fated Exxon Valdez (which spilled some 262,000 barrels of oilinto Alaska's Prince William Sound), had a blood test morethan 10hours after his supertanker ran aground and showed a blood-alcohollevel far higher than allowed for ship operators.   That fact alone should silence American Civil Liberties Unionzealots and organized labor leaders who vociferously oppose randomdrug testing of personnel engaged in transportation.   The way to weed out drug and alcohol abusers from sensitiveairline, shipping, rail, bus and trucking jobs is to test thembefore, and not only after, they cause terrible accidents.</TEXT><TEXT>   April 4   Syracuse (N.Y.) Herald-Journal on a bank account for a spy:   It is galling to think that an American who betrayed his countryis having a nest egg built for him while he awaits his release fromprison. But the United States ... can make sure Jonathan Pollardnever collects a dime.   The former U.S. intelligence analyst was convicted two years agoof providing American secrets to the Israelis. According to areport in this week's Newsweek magazine, Israel is putting $5,000 amonth in an Israeli bank account for Pollard, who is serving a lifesentence in an Illinois federal prison. The scenario is thatPollard eventually will be deported to Israel, where the money willbe waiting for him.   This would be an outrage if the solution weren't so obvious:Don't let Pollard go. He has been sentenced to life. Make him serveevery day of his sentence.</TEXT><TEXT>   April 1   St. Petersburg (Fla.) Times on bank deposit insurance:   Large American banks are getting a free ride on some $350billion in deposits at their foreign branches.   Because the funds are nominally uninsured by the Federal DepositInsurance Corp., they pay no insurance premiums.   Should any of those banks fail, however, the government mostlikely would be obliged to protect all the depositors.   In that light, they ought to be assessed for premiums.</TEXT><TEXT>   April 1   McPherson (Kan.) Sentinel on the Bush administration's slowstart:   In office less than three months, the Bush administration hasbeen criticized for getting off to a slow start.   In part, of course, that may be attributed to the time requiredfor presidential appointments in the face of a Congress that seemsintent on casting aspersion on the administration by innuendo.   Even without that, however, it appears the only person in chargeof any policy-making is Secretary of State James Baker.   That leaves a huge void in matters relating to the domesticeconomy, which is perhaps this country's most pressing need.   The Reagan administration was successful because it had itspolicies clearly defined.   The Bush administration needs to do the same before all of thebureaucrats have taken firm control. It should make its firstpriority domestic policy.</TEXT><TEXT>   March 31   The Orange County (Calif.) Register on raising federal salaries:   Read our lips: No pay raise for congressmen and governmentbosses. So Americans resoundingly insisted last month.   Radio talk shows lit up the airwaves with attacks on theproposal, by a presidential commission, to raise ... pay 51percent. ...   Even though Congress had rigged the system so the raise wouldbecome automatic, public rage forced the members to rescind it. ...   But (last) week another panel, the National Commision on PublicService, called for the same thing: a 50 percent pay raise for ourallegedly impoverished servants in Washington. ...   Presumably one might pay the current bureaucrats more to attractbetter people to the job in the future.   But, as the failed nomination of John Tower as defense secretaryshows, people are willing to go to absurd lengths to get these``low-paying'' jobs.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
