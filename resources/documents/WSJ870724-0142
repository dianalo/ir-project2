Moore and Craig FormanStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 07/24/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> SHE AXPSECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) </IN><DATELINE> LONDON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. said it is reviewing staffing levels here, amid speculation that the big U.S. securities firm may lay off almost a third of its 1,400 London employees.    Jacques Gelardin, chairman of Shearson's London unit, said the firm is evaluating staffing levels, particularly in such core areas as commodities, fixed-income securities and equity trading. Like many securities firms here, Shearson faces declining commission revenue and greater competition after the recent deregulation of London's securities markets. Shearson's overhead costs have ballooned lately, prompting some analysts to suggest that it may be preparing to shift some staff from sluggish bond markets to equity-trading operations.    Mr. Gelardin, in an interview yesterday, said the staffing review probably would be completed by the end of the summer. He declined to forecast whether there will be layoffs or how extensive any layoffs would be. He also indicated that any reductions would be gradual, saying: &quot;We won't go out and do any one major thing.&quot;    Peter Cohen, Shearson chairman and chief executive officer, said in a recent interview in New York that the firm's London office currently isn't profitable.    Shearson's review is the latest sign of an upheaval in London securities houses. Many U.S. and British houses have begun pruning their London staffs, which expanded rapidly in the months prior to last October's deregulation of the markets here. London traders have speculated lately that many securities firms are preparing lists for possible layoffs as a number of major players here begin to assess results from their first nine months of deregulated operations.    In particular, Shearson has been strained by its rapid expansion. During the past year, it nearly doubled the London payroll to 1,400, adding about 500 employees through its purchase of the British brokerage L. Messel andamp; Co.    Facing heightened rivalry in equities and bond trading, Shearson reduced its market-making capacity in British equities earlier this year. There also has been a suggestion of discord in the expanded London office.    &quot;Clearly people have been unhappy at Messel,&quot; said one British broker, who requested anonymity. &quot;The Shearson folks have been pretty pushy.&quot; Sources in the London securities markets add that Shearson executives brought from New York have clashed with some British research staff members.    Shearson officials here couldn't be reached for comment on possible discord at the office. </TEXT></DOC>
