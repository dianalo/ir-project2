MICHAEL DUKAKIS, asked whether he plans to respond to GeorgeBush's attacks that he's an elitist by bringing up Bush's ownbackground, which includes Yale University: ``I really am notinterested. I don't think the American people are interested. Ithink that's a losing strategy.''      GEORGE BUSH, saying he finds it curious that Dukakis has accusedhim of dirty politics after he attacked Dukakis' domestic andforeign policies: ``You're looking at a guy who's been getting hitfor six months, guilt by association, and all kinds of personalattacks. What happens now, they raise the mudslinging thing. Thisis going to be a fun campaign.''      REP. WILLIAM GRAY III of Pennsylvania, drafting committeechairman, hoping to craft a party platform that suits both Dukakisand Jackson: ``As we go through the discussion of issues _ drugs,education, civil rights, health care ... hopefully they'll realizethat their differences are not that great and begin to come to aconsensus of their own.''      PAUL KIRK, Democratic Party chief, pushing his dream of a shortand readable platform: ``I don't think we'll end up with the YellowPages, an ad for every organized group.''</TEXT></DOC>
