(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service hasproposed opening the forests surrounding Yellowstone National Parkto limited hunting of grizzly bears that pose threats to people orlivestock.   The proposal appeared in the Federal Register Tuesday, opening a60-day public comment period.   Grizzly bears, a threatened species in the lower 48 states, arenow protected under the federal Endangered Species Act, thoughlimited hunting is allowed in northwest Montana.   The Fish and Wildlife proposal, if approved, would allow huntingof nuisance grizzlies, including those that leave Yellowstone andGrand Teton national parks, in an area of more than 10 millionacres in the forests of southwest Montana, northwest Wyoming andeastern Idaho.   Nuisance grizzlies are defined as those that threaten humansafety, have killed or injured livestock or that ``can't reasonablybe controlled'' by trapping or removal from a location, said a U.S.Fish and Wildlife spokeswoman in Washington.   A Wyoming Game and Fish official who helped originate theproposal said it would merely extend to Wyoming and Idaho theoption granted years ago to Montana in the area around GlacierNational Park.   Nuisance grizzlies near Yellowstone are now killed by state gamewardens, said John Talbott of the Wyoming Game and Fish Department.Talbott is chairman of the Yellowstone ecosystem grizzly bearsubcommittee of the Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee, made up ofstate and federal wildlife officials.   ``What we're looking at is, rather than the agency doing that,we'll just provide an opportunity for the sportsman to harvest thatbear,'' Talbott said.   But Michael Scott, a Wilderness Society official in Bozeman,said the hunt could pose a conflict of interest for wildlifemanagers.   ``This would be an opportunity for the state to make somemoney,'' Scott said. He feared biologists could unconsciouslydeclare a difficult grizzly a nuisance bear so that it could behunted and the state would profit.   ``The whole rationale for allowing a hunt of this type is togive people the thrill of hunting,'' Scott said Tuesday.   Talbott said he knew of only one case in the past five years inwhich a problem grizzly was killed in Wyoming.   In Montana, two hunts for nuisance grizzlies have been held inthe past three years near Glacier, and one grizzly was killed, saidRon Marcoux, deputy director of Fish, Wildlife and Parks in Helena.   Montana law allows no more than 25 man-caused grizzly deaths ayear. A limited state hunting season along the Northern RockyMountain front extends from Oct. 1 through Nov. 26, and is closedearlier if the bear toll reaches 25, said Fish, Wildlife and Parksspokesman Don Bianchi of Bozeman.</TEXT></DOC>
