The United States and other Western nations that have nucleararms succeeded in blocking efforts led by Arab states to link thecontrol of chemical and nuclear weapons in the declaration, which isnot legally binding.   The United States, the most fervent opponent of the Arabposition, said it was gratified by the results of the five-dayinternational conference.   ``The U.S. objectives for the conference were to focus worldwideattention on the problems of chemical weapons use and chemicalweapons proliferation and help put a stop to the use of theseweapons in violation of international law,'' said State Departmentspokesman Charles Redman in Washington.   But Maj. Gen. William F. Burns, head of the U.S. disarmementagency and leader of the U.S. delegation, indicated the declarationfell short of expectations.   ``We believe the goals here have been accomplished,'' Burns tolda news conference, saying the discussion had ``heightened theconcerns of the world'' about chemical arms. But he added:   ``If the United States had written this statement, which we didnot, it might have been stronger.''   Burns said the United States would have liked to see explicitlanguage on sanctions _ a word not mentioned in the finaldeclaration.   The United States indicated in a statement it also would haveliked language directly addressing the need for export controls onchemical products used to make toxic weapons.   The objective of the conference was to reaffirm the 1925 GenevaProtocol banning chemical weapons and give new life to languishingnegotiations in Geneva for a total ban on development, use,production and stocking of chemical arms.   French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas, who presided over theconference, said at least 10 more nations had agreed to sign theGeneva Protocol, bringing the number of adherents to nearly 130.   The six-point declaration issued at the conference also affirmedthe U.N. role in investigating chemical weapons use and called for astrengthening of existing procedures at the United Nations indealing with such use _ a reference to enacting sanctions.   In a compromise to appease Arab states, the declaration stressedthe need to secure ``general and complete disarmament,'' a passagefrom a 1978 U.N. document. But the declaration did not mention theword ``nuclear.''   Arab nations had said they wanted to reserve the right to possesschemical weapons to counter what they claim is a nuclear threat fromIsrael.   Earlier Wednesday, Iraqi Vice Premier Tarik Aziz said the Arabnations would concede their demand in order to get a consensus, andwould pursue their objective at negotiations in Geneva.   Iraq's use of chemical weapons in its eight-year war with Iranprovided a somber backdrop for the conference, and Iran succeeded ingetting a reference to ``recent violations'' of the protocol in thedeclaration.   The Iranian delegation voiced a reservation after the declarationwas approved, saying the document fell short of a categoricalcondemnation of past use of chemical weapons. Iran had been pressingfor language that would indicate Iraqi use of chemicals against Iranwas the ``raison d'etre'' for this conference.   Work continued until the last minute to find wording that wouldsatisfy all 149 delegations to the conference.   The participating states ``solemnly affirm their commitments notto use chemical weapons and condemn such use,'' the declarationsaid. ``They recall their serious concern at recent violations asestablished and condemned by the competent organs of the UnitedNations.   ``The participating states stress the necessity of concluding, atan early date, a convention on the prohibition of the development,production, stockpiling and use of all chemical weapons, and ontheir destruction. This convention shall be global and comprehensiveand effectively verifiable.''   Dumas said the unanimous approval of the final declaration was``tantamount to saying the whole international community has taken aposture'' against chemical weapons.   The Soviet Union, which also rejected the Arab demand for linkageof chemical and nuclear weapons, said it was also satisfied althoughit would have preferred ``more energetic words aimed at theconclusion'' of talks in Geneva.   The declaration is an expression of political will with no legalweight nor enforcement powers.   After two days, it became clear that Arab nations had formed afront against Israel, which they claim has nuclear weapons. Israelhas never responded directly to allegations it has such weapons.   Other countries, led by the United States, argued that chemicalweapons, unlike nuclear arms, are not a deterrent.   Both chemical and nuclear arms are considered weapons of massdestruction.   About 20 nations have chemical weapons capabilities, according toestimates. But the Soviet Union and the United States are the onlytwo countries to admit possessing them.</TEXT></DOC>
