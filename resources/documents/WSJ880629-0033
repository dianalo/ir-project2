Putnam's Sons, 219 pages, $17.95), to sense bad news. Like Ms. Hoffman's last book, &quot;Illumination Night,&quot; this one takes place in an idyllic New England beach town. So content are the people living here amid the egrets and lightning bugs and fried clams that their bliss could only signal disaster.    Catastrophe couldn't happen to a nicer family. Ivan Farrell is an astronomer; his wife, Polly, dabbles in photography, taking pictures for a friend's book about communing with the dead. Their children are Charlie, eight, who raises hamsters and newts and is wild about dinosaurs, and Amanda, 11, a champion gymnast and perfect in every other possible way. &quot;She is a creature Polly cannot name,&quot; writes Ms. Hoffman, &quot;one made up not of flesh but of points of brilliant light.&quot;    In case Amanda's sudden swollen glands and vomiting are not properly convincing that there is trouble in this paradise, Ms. Hoffman provides a local medium, Laurel Smith, for additional scare appeal. Laurel has been obsessed with death since childhood. &quot;While other girls her age were thinking about shades of lipstick and Saturday nights, Laurel could not stop thinking about the brevity of a human lifespan.&quot; Now in her early 30s, Laurel has nurtured her preoccupation into a full-time job (it is her seances that Polly has been photographing), even though the subject of death still terrifies her: &quot;When baby cries, she hears a death rattle.&quot;    With portents of doom on every page, it is not a surprise to learn that Amanda has AIDS, contracted from a transfusion of contaminated blood she received during an appendectomy five years earlier. If the narrative to this point has been somewhat diffuse, it now settles grandly into solid melodrama. The characters march along in a parade of cliches. There is Jack Eagan, the tough gymnastics coach with a heart of gold; there are panicked parents who organize a coalition to try to prevent Amanda from attending school. A heroic school principal fights against the prevailing hysteria and comes perilously close to losing her job. Amanda's father, in his more desperate moods, calls an AIDS hotline and a homosexual man named Brian alternatively comforts and horrifies him with information about the disease. The characters have a lot of nightmares. In their waking hours they spend a great deal of time sunk in romanticized musings about death.    The combination of sentimentality and quotidian detail in the novel produces a comic effect that Ms. Hoffman has surely not intended. When Amanda becomes too weak to compete in a gymnastics event, Ms. Hoffman writes about the coach: &quot;Jack Eagan thinks to himself that life stinks. It stinks because things are beautiful and then they're taken away.&quot; In another episode, Amanda fights with her parents about permission to attend a sleepover party, and the altercation ends like this: &quot;{Amanda's} words fall across the table like splinters of glass. They should be eating chocolate cake, instead they are bleeding from their souls.&quot;    What quickly becomes most clear about &quot;At Risk&quot; is its unconditional failure to evince a genuine response to AIDS. In fact, in an important way the novel has nothing to do with AIDS at all. At one point Amanda's mother expresses anger that her neighbors are doing nothing to help her; she is convinced that &quot;if Amanda had cancer or a brain tumor, they'd be bringing her casseroles and cakes.&quot; But of course for Ms. Hoffman's purposes cancer or a brain tumor would have done nicely here as well. It's just that with AIDS comes the tingle of contemporaneity. What is necessary is not the particular illness itself but the atmosphere it provides -- an atmosphere from which Ms. Hoffman can grind out the appropriate amount of false melancholy and manufactured fear. In AIDS she has found ready-made conditions for the perfect melodrama, and can count on exploiting already available public sympathy.    It is a commonplace that in a comfortable society people often seek to excite themselves with images of their own demise. Ms. Hoffman's recognition of this fact seems to have been her primary motivation for writing &quot;At Risk.&quot; Where she might have tried to create characters who seem even vaguely like real people, she chose to provide flat caricatures. Where she might have reached into a controversial subject for something new to say about it, she chose to exploit it for its sentimental appeal. One can only conclude that one of Alice Hoffman's particular hopes regarding this book was that the subject of AIDS would sell. The result is a novel that at its best is a fairy tale (like &quot;Illumination Night,&quot; which featured a real giant), and at its worst is a piece of kitsch, specific to the year in which it takes place and yet totally irrelevant to it. Talk about cheap thrills.    ---   Miss Rifkind is the assistant managing editor of The New Criterion. </TEXT></DOC>
