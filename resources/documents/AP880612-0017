Just a week after President Reagan bade a warm farewell toSoviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in Moscow, peace talks in Nicaraguabroke down and once again there is talk of renewing U.S. militaryaid to the Contra rebels.   Although the administration has made no decisions, officialsseem to be laying the groundwork for a new aid request now that thenegotiations between the Soviet-backed Sandinistas and the Contrashave collapsed, at least for the time being.   The experience at the summit suggests Washington and Moscow areable to move ahead on such issues as arms control, human rights andbilateral issues, but mutual suspicions continue to run high in theso-called ``low intensity conflicts'' in the Third World. Suchconflicts continue in Central America, southern Africa, the MiddleEast, the Persian Gulf and Southeast Asia.   Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams acknowledged in aninterview Friday that whatever progress Reagan and Gorbachev havemade on other issues during their summit meetings, U.S. concernsabout Kremlin policy in Nicaragua remain unchanged.   ``The Soviet Union has not shown any restraint in shipment ofarms to Sandinistas,'' Abrams said. Estimates of Soviet militarydeliveries to the Nicaraguan government range between $250 millionand $500 million since five Central American presidents signed aregional peace plan 10 months ago, he said.   Abrams rejected out of hand a Soviet proposal to end militarydeliveries to the Sandinistas provided the United States terminatessuch shipments to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.   He said this would make Moscow and Washington coequal in an areaof vital interest to the United States and of no historic interestto the Kremlin   If the United States ceases aiding its allies in CentralAmerica, ``how are they to resist Cuban subversion?'' he asked.   The Kremlin view is that the United States, by aiding theNicaraguan rebels starting just months after Reagan took office in1981, bears the major responsibility for the death and destructionin Nicaragua since then.   Abrams had had little to say on Nicaragua after Congressrejected on Feb. 3 Reagan's last request for military aid for theContras. But after the peace talks broke down last Thursday, hesounded like his old combative self again, accusing the Sandinistasof engaging in bad faith.   ``It's important to be clear on what happened,'' Abrams said.The rebels wanted the Sandinistas to turn ``vague promises'' ofdemocracy for Nicaragua into a firm timetable. But the only firmtimetable the Sandinistas wanted to discuss was the one in whichthe rebels would be required to turn in their arms as part of afinal settlement, he said.   ``When the time came for the Sandinistas to make seriouscommitments, it was over,'' he said.   That view was not shared by Nicaraguan Defense Minister HumbertoOrtega, head of the Sandinista delegation, who said Thursday theContras held ``irrational positions'' and maintained an``anti-negotiation attitude against the peace.''   As for the prospect for a new Contra aid request, theadministration is expected to discuss that issue this coming week.On Capitol Hill, the main protagonists on past Contra aid votesalready are staking out positions along familiar lines.   ``I encourage the White House to move now ... and send up an aidpackage for a vote before the July recess,'' said Rep. Jack Kemp,R-N.Y.   Said Rep. David Bonior, R-Mich., ``This is no time to be talkingof military aid.''</TEXT></DOC>
