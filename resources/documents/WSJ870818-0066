The bank said that as of Saturday Zambia was in arrears by $22.1 million in interest and other charges and by $18.3 million in repayment of principal. The corresponding figures for Sierra Leone are $500,000 and $900,000.    The bank, following its usual practice in dealing with delinquent borrowers, earlier had suspended disbursement of new loans to both African countries when they became more than 75 days overdue on debt payments. The latest step of putting the countries' loans on a non-accrual basis means the bank no longer will include interest payments and other charges due from the two countries in its income statements.    A bank spokesman said the reclassification is &quot;purely an accounting action&quot; to avoid overstating the bank's income. The bank will continue its dialogue with the two countries on their economic conditions and plans for debt repayment, the spokesman said. The bank also has declared loans to Nicaragua, Syria, Liberia, Peru and other countries to be non-accruing for similar reasons. </TEXT></DOC>
