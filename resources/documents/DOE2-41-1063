<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-41-1063 </DOCNO><TEXT>Using polarized proton beam and the Saclay frozen spin polarized target,the parameter A/sub oonn/(pp) was measured at 0.88, 1.1, 1.3, 1.6, 1.8,2.1, 2.4 and 2.7 GeV. The measurements carried out at the first two energiesin the angular region 24 deg {le}{Theta}sub CM/ {le}60 deg complete theprevious data at {Theta}sub CM/ from 45 deg to 90 deg. Between 1.3 and2.7 GeV the measurements were performed in two overlapping angular regions:25 deg {le}{Theta}sub CM/ {le}55 deg and 50 deg {le}{Theta}sub CM/ {le}95deg. The value of A/sub oonn/ at 90 deg CM decreases from A/sub oonn/{approx_equal}0.57 at 0.88 GeV to A/sub oonn/ {approx_equal}0.42 at 1.3GeV and starts to rise again. It reaches its maximum of {approx_equal}0.52at 1.8 MeV and decreases to {approx_equal}0.35 at 2.7 GeV. 1 fig.</TEXT></DOC>
