(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   General Electric Co. will buy Borg-WarnerCorp.'s chemical business for $2.31 billion in cash in a dealannounced Thursday that will help Borg-Warner pay off the hugedebts acquired in going private last year.   The deal will also swell the size of GE's rapidly growingplastics business, which will do sales of nearly $3 billion thisyear.   ``This is a big-time deal,'' said Nicholas P. Heymann, ananalyst for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York. ``It's arisk-free area (for GE) and it's not controversial.''   Chicago-based Borg-Warner will use the proceeds to reduce thedebt it took on last year in a $4.7 billion leveraged buyout toavoid a takeover by GAF Corp.   Borg-Warner took on bank debt of $3.4 billion in going privateand has been reducing it through proceeds from asset sales.   Borg-Warner said it will have no trouble meeting the agreementwith banks to repay their loans by the end of 1988. ``It's a slamdunk,'' Donald Trauscht, the chief financial officer, said in aninterview Thursday.   The Borg-Warner chemical business, headquartered in Parkersburg,W.Va., had sales of $1.25 billion in 1987. It is the worldwideleader in resins for a kind of plastic, ABS, that is widely used asa substitute for metal or glass.   ``This acquisition is an important step in our worldwidematerials strategy,'' Glen Hiner, senior vice president for GEPlastics, said in a news release.   Heymann said GE's plastics business has accounted for about 5percent of sales and 12 percent of earnings. He predicted that in1989, the expanded business would account for 10 to 12 percent ofsales and 18 to 20 percent of earnings.   GE said it expects the purchase to add about 5 cents a share toits profits in 1989 after all acquisition costs are paid.   Borg-Warner's other businesses are automotive components, andinformation and protective services. The company's protectiveservices includes armored cars, guards and alarm stations under thenames of Wells Fargo, Burns Security and Pony Express. Autocomponents include transmissions, transmission components andfour-wheel drive components.   Borg-Warner's leveraged buyout, led by Merrill Lynch CapitalPartners, included the payment to shareholders of more than $4.1billion in cash and slightly less than $300 million in junk bonds,as well as the assumption of a little under $300 million in debt.   Merrill Lynch owns 51 percent of Borg-Warner's stock.   Among other asset sales, the company sold BWAC Inc., a financeunit, for $782.5 million to Transamerica Inc., and Chilton Corp.,its credit-reporting subsidiary, to TRW Inc. for $360 million.   GE said it will also assume $35 million in Borg-Warner'slong-term debt.   GE has been rapidly expanding its GE Plastics unit, whichexpects sales of nearly $3 billion this year. It invested $325million for a new polycarbonate plant in Burkville, Ala., lastyear, and will double the size of the plant by 1990 at a cost of$315 million.   In May, GE Silicones announced an agreement to combine withUnion Carbide Corp.'s silicones business to form GE CarbideSilicones Inc., a joint venture with annual sales of about $750million.   Borg-Warner's chemical specialty, ASB, which stands foracrylonitrile butadiene styrene, is a thermoplastic with strengthand molding characteristics that make it popular for such uses ascomputer housings, helmets and car parts.   ``We think this is a good fit with GE,'' Heymann said. ``Itmoves (GE) into new niches within the same product markets and itdoes give GE new geographical markets.''   He said GE has not been a big factor in the Far East, an areawhere he said Borg-Warner is ``a dominant player.''   The transaction is subject to government approvals and isexpected to be completed by the end of 1988, the companies said.</TEXT></DOC>
