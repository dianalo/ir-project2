(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Foul-smelling gases from two rancid grainpiles near a grain elevator caused the death of a 24-year-oldpregnant woman who lived nearby, according to a lawsuit filed byher family.   Renee Oland, who was seven months pregnant, died in September1987 from an accumulation of fluid in her lungs, according to thelawsuit filed in federal court in Fargo.   Mrs. Oland lived in Lidgerwood less than 200 yards from two hugegrain piles maintained by Harvest States Cooperative of St. Paul,Minn., the lawsuit said. The piles were begun in 1986 after thecompany's elevator ran out of space.   David Karpinski, a spokesman for Harvest States in St. Paul,declined comment on the lawsuit Thursday.   The grain piles were drenched by rain before they were coveredand began to spoil, according to the lawsuit. Residents ofLidgerwood, in North Dakota's southeastern corner 60 miles south ofFargo, began to complain of the odor in the summer of 1987.   Harvest States removed most of the grain later that year.   The lawsuit maintains the odor from the spoiling grain causedmedical complications that led to the death of Mrs. Oland and herfetus, according to Galen Vaa, a Moorhead, Minn., attorneyrepresenting the family.   Storing grain outdoors and using chemicals to cut spoilage is``an abnormally dangerous business activity,'' said the lawsuit,filed by Mrs. Oland's father, husband and surviving son.</TEXT></DOC>
