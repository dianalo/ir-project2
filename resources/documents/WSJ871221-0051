He was right.    The $9 billion tax increase that Congress is expected to approve as early as today contains benefits and exemptions that would cost $900 million in government revenue this fiscal year and a total of $1.6 billion over the next two years.    In the deficit-reduction accord reached last month, White House and congressional officials agreed to eschew revenue-losing giveaways in fashioning the tax-increase bill. This acceded to a demand by President Reagan and congressional Republicans, who particularly wanted to avoid any of the now-notorious &quot;transition rules&quot; that exempt corporations and localities from selected tax increases in a bill.    And, in fact, if Congress approves the tax bill conferees wrote last week, corporations will see higher taxes.    But, in many ways, the trade-offs in this bill represent business as usual. Pushed by both Republican and Democratic lawmakers, at least half a dozen transition rules and special effective dates ended up in the legislation, including two huge provisions designed to save major corporations hundreds of millions of dollars in tax payments that they otherwise would have to pay under the legislation.    And in one case, the bill does away with a portion of last year's massive tax-overhaul law by restoring a big tax break for certain sellers of small businesses and real estate. This one provision would result in the loss of $650 million over two years.    &quot;Sure, it's a lot of money,&quot; said Senate Finance Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas) yesterday. &quot;But we've collected far more than we allowed not to be collected, and it was necessary to put the deal together.&quot;    To be sure, the legislation does raise taxes by $23 billion over two years, and $9 billion in the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30, 1988. &quot;Short-term losses from transition rules and other special exemptions can be outweighed by permanent tax increases,&quot; said Robert McIntyre, director of Citizens for Tax Justice.    Business is delighted with the generous granting of exceptions to the increases in the bill, particularly those breaks that protect transactions -- not only those recently completed, but those merely contemplated. &quot;This tax bill sends a message to the business community that it won't upset our expectations, that we can go through with the deals we have planned,&quot; said Peter Faber, a New York tax attorney.    Congressional tax writers did decide to overrule a controversial tax-court ruling on Woods Investment Co. and force corporations to pay higher taxes on the sale of certain subsidiaries.    The provision, which would raise $662 million, requires a corporation to reduce the tax value in the stock of a subsidiary at the same accelerated rate used in depreciating the subsidiary's assets, effectively forcing the corporation to recognize a larger amount of gain on the subsidiary's sale than it does currently.    But the tax conferees decided to provide exemptions to the provision for any corporation that has a &quot;binding contract&quot; to sell its subsidiary, even if the transaction isn't completed before the new law takes effect.    And the conferees provided further exemptions tailored to specific transactions. The new provision would exempt any sale that is &quot;pursuant to a governmental order,&quot; to take care of Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp., Chicago, which is expected to sell its Southern Pacific railroad unit to comply with an Interstate Commerce Commission order to shed one of its railroad subsidiaries.    Another exemption was added for an expected unit sale in which the parent, Emerson Electric Co., had incurred &quot;a $1 million non-refundable finder's fee.&quot;    Congressional sources say lawmakers also hope to relieve other corporations with planned unit sales, including: United Technologies Corp., Fairchild Industries Inc., Communications Satellite Corp., Security Pacific Corp. and Allegis Corp.    As a result of these exemptions, the lawmakers gave up revenue of about $420 million over two years, leading some lobbyists to joke that the transition rule ate the tax increase.    Lawmakers agreed to generous exemptions on another corporate provision at a loss to the federal government of about $555 million over two years. This provision would tax corporate acquisitions when the buyer wants to dispose of part of the acquired assets. Typically, these assets are placed in subsidiaries that &quot;mirror&quot; the structure of the unwanted unit.    But, according to congressional sources, the provision is written in such a way that it would exempt such companies as Owens-Illinois Inc., which made a tender offer for Brockway Inc. in September; and Bond Corp. Holdings of Australia, which has proposed a takeover of G. Heileman Brewing Co.    Henley Group Inc., La Jolla, Calif., lobbied for a &quot;mirror&quot; exemption in case it succeeds in taking over Santa Fe and wants to dispose of some of the corporation's assets. Henley was represented in its efforts by former Senate Finance Chairman Russell Long, congressional sources said, although the former top congressional tax writer said, &quot;I know something about it, but I just don't think I'll discuss it.&quot;    The tax conferees eventually decided against an exemption for Henley because it is only one of several bidders for Santa Fe or its railroad. &quot;Congress shouldn't act in a way that affects one proposal differently from others. We should be neutral,&quot; said Sen. John Danforth (R., Mo.)    But another provision would restore a tax break, despite the requirement in the budget accord that no revenue-losing measures should be included. This provision would restore the installment-sales method of accounting for the sale of small businesses and for &quot;casual sales&quot; of real estate and investment property on credit.    The measure would enable such sellers who receive a note as part of a sale to defer their tax payments until they receive payments on the note. Last year's tax law had substantially curtailed the use of this tax-deferral technique.    One revenue-raising provision contains a special benefit carved out for a few giant poultry companies. The measure would repeal the cash method of accounting for family farms, but would prevent the government from collecting deferred taxes from Tyson Foods Inc. and Perdue Inc. as long as these companies remain at least 50% family-owned. This special benefit would save the companies as much as $140 million over two years from what they otherwise would have to pay in taxes under the legislation.    Because the revenue-losing provisions are generally generic in nature, they could benefit companies or individuals other than those lawmakers intended to accommodate. &quot;There could be even a bigger revenue loss than they know about,&quot; predicted one lobbyist. </TEXT></DOC>
