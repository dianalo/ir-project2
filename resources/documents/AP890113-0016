ANDREWS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Surviving crew members of the World War IIsubmarine Finback are looking forward to a nostalgic reunion withGeorge Bush, the young Navy pilot they dubbed ``Ellie the Elephant''after rescuing him from the Pacific Ocean more than 44 years ago.   Don Kohler, 64, of Rogers, Ark., the torpedoman who helped pull agrateful Bush to safety from his orange life raft onto the Finback'sdeck, remembers offering a smile and a hearty ``welcome aboard,''but recalls little else about the incident.   ``At that time, he was just another downed pilot,'' said Kohler,a retired Chicago businessman. ``Nobody back then knew he'd becomepresident of the United States.''   Rescued after his plane was shot down by Japanese fire, Busheagerly took his turn at night lookout watches and other seagoingduties, watched Betty Grable movies in the wardroom and donnedearphones to listen in awe as the submarine's torpedoes sank twoenemy ships.   Former Finback officers remember the 20-year-old Bush as agregarious jokester who earned the nickname ``Ellie'' for his comicwardroom imitation of a trumpeting elephant, they said in recenttelephone interviews.   ``I remember he was very lively, obviously intelligent and verypersonable,'' said retired Rear Adm. Lawrence Heyworth of VirginiaBeach, Va., who was the Finback's torpedo and gunnery officer whenBush was hauled aboard on Sept. 2, 1944.   Said Heyworth: ``All three pilots we rescued were bright,bright-eyed young men, but George seemed the most outgoing and hadthe most ebullient personality. He was the most entertaining, and hemade us laugh a lot.   ``We called him Ellie because of his outstanding imitation of anelephant trumpeting. Ellie the Elephant. It wasn't because we allsat around thinking we were Republicans. We must have seen one in aTarzan movie. We just thought elephants were funny. We kept askingGeorge to do it over and over again.''   ``He had a tremendous sense of humor,'' recalled W.E. ``Bill''Edwards of Bay St. Louis, Miss., an insurance agent and retired Navycommander. As a bearded ensign aboard the Finback, Edwards filmedBush's rescue with an 8mm Kodak movie camera.   Edwards said that at last count, nearly 30 surviving officers andenlisted crewmen of the Finback were planning to attend Bush'sswearing-in at noontime Jan. 20 at the Capitol.   They and a few of Bush's former flying buddies plan to sittogether in prime bleacher seats on Pennsylvania Avenue for theinaugural parade after Bush takes the presidential oath of office.   Inaugural officials reportedly were trying to arrange a reunionfor Bush and his old submarine buddies at Blair House, thepresidential guest quarters across the street from the White House,possibly next Wednesday.   Heyworth and Edwards have stayed in touch with Bush over theyears. But most of the Finback veterans haven't seen or spoken toBush since he left the submarine at Midway Island after a month-longcombat patrol.   Bush won the Distinguished Flying Cross for completing hisbombing run against a Japanese radio communications center in theBonin Islands, about 600 miles south of Japan, after his GrummanAvenger torpedo bomber was struck by enemy fire and engulfed inflames. Bush bailed out over the water but his two crew members werelost.   According to his autobiography, Bush's only injuries were a gashon the forehead and a painful sting from a Portuguese man-of-war. Hewas picked up by the Finback less than two hours after his parachutehit the ocean.   ``I'm proud of what I was able to do to help Mr. Bush on boardour boat,'' said Kohler.   But Dan Moody, 71, a Finback veteran and retired radiationlaboratory technician living in Albany, Calif., gave little thoughtto Bush at the time.   ``We brought him aboard, dried him out and gave him hot coffee,''he said, and then forgot him.   ``I was 26 years old and a first class torpedoman,'' Moody said.``Who'd pay any attention to a 20-year-old kid?''</TEXT></DOC>
