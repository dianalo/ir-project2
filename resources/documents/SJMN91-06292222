These are guys notaccustomed to accounting for themselves. Perhaps that's what giving up 39points will do to you.;   &quot;We were embarrassed,&quot; linebacker Keith DeLong said.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  49ERS WILL TRY TO TAME LIONS' RUN-AND-SHOOTSANDERS MAKES THE TASK DOUBLY DIFFICULT  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Pro Football  </MEMO><TEXT>     &quot;We're taking a hard look at ourselves,&quot; defensive end Pierce Holt said.;  &quot;We didn't play well the last game, which was obvious to the whole world,&quot;defensive coordinator Bill McPherson said. That, and a 39-34 loss to theAtlanta Falcons, about sums it up.;   Last Sunday, the run-and-shoot Falconsmade the 49ers' defense want to run and hide. But there is no relief in sight.Two of the next three opponents -- the 5-1 Detroit Lions on Sunday atCandlestick Park and the Falcons again Nov. 3 in Atlanta -- are poised to keepthe normally stout 49ers defense in disarray.;   If nothing else, what the49ers took away from the humiliating loss to Atlanta was a helpful game filmshowing just what their weaknesses are against the run-and-shoot:;   (check) Adistinct absence of a pass rush.;   Charles Haley, who had eight sacks thistime last year, had only two sacks entering last week's game. His total stillstands at two.;   Constant double-teaming by opponents was the excuse beforeAtlanta came to town. But it took only one Falcons tackle -- six-time Pro Bowlplayer Chris Hinton the first half, five-time Pro Bowl player Mike Kenn thesecond half -- to contain him. Newly acquired sack master Tim Harris wascovered the same way and was equally inept against the pass. Like Haley, histhree tackles came in pursuit of runs.;   A good run-and-shoot offenseconfounds defenses by simple deception -- just when the linebackers are passrushing, the quarterback hands off to the running back.;   &quot;Ask me more aboutthe pass rush when we play a more conventional defense,&quot; McPherson said.;  Against the Falcons, the 49ers tried to stop the big pass play by playingalmost exclusive nickel defense, with a setup using six defensive backs, fourdown linemen and only one linebacker, Bill Romanowski. But that leaves the rundefense vulnerable, which brings us to the 49ers' . . .;   (check) Difficultyshutting down runs up the middle, especially those coming off draw plays.;  Injuries to key defensive linemen, some of the team's best run defenders, havecompounded the problem. Starting defensive end Kevin Fagan (ankle) will misshis third game Sunday. Holt returned to the starting lineup against Atlantaafter missing time with a knee injury. Key backup Larry Roberts has beenslowed by a foot injury.;   &quot;We played them twice last year and did prettygood against their run,&quot; McPherson said, &quot;so we thought we would be OK andwere going for the quarterback. So they took advantage of our over-enthusiasmto get to the quarterback by running a lot of draw plays, and they made somebig yards with that.&quot;;   This week, the NFL's leading rusher, Barry Sanders(640 yards, seven touchdowns) almost certainly will get 25 to 30 carries,making the defense's job against the run-and-shoot that much harder.;   &quot;Notonly will they run draw plays and plays up the middle like that, they'll giveit to Barry and let him take it outside,&quot; Holt said. &quot;He's got tremendousspeed, and he spreads you really thin.&quot;;   To compensate, DeLong says, the49ers probably will use two inside linebackers and a front fortified byoutside linebackers.;   &quot;And swarm him,&quot; DeLong said. &quot;One guy, unless you geta really good hit on him, isn't going to bring him down.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  NANCY GAY, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911018  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  602  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday, October 18, 199100292222,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
