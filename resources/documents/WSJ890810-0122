Arco, which caters to price-conscious buyers in five Western states, has notified its Southern California dealers that it will dump its leaded regular gasoline effective Sept. 1 and begin promoting a middle-octane, medium-priced unleaded fuel.    In other parts of the country, gasoline companies have already de-emphasized or dropped leaded fuel in favor of three unleaded grades -- a pricey high-octane premium, a midgrade and regular. But in the West, regular with lead added remains popular because of a sizable population of pre-1975 cars. Leaded gasoline can't be used in later models because it fouls pollution control gear.    Right now, of the leading West Coast marketers, only Unocal Corp. does without a leaded grade in favor of a midgrade unleaded gasoline.    Arco officials in Los Angeles wouldn't discuss their plans but acknowledged the coming switch. &quot;We are dropping our leaded gas in Southern California,&quot; said Ed Reilly, senior vice president, marketing. &quot;I think everybody knows it's just a first step&quot; to switching throughout its market.    Though Arco won't describe the chemical properties of its new unleaded gasoline, it has hinted to some distributors that it will be promoted to customers who now fill up with leaded as well as to owners of newer models.    While there is disagreement, many owners of pre-1975 cars believe lead additives provide necessary lubrication to engine valves that newer cars don't need. So, even though unleaded premium gasoline can often meet the higher octane requirements of many older cars, demand for leaded has remained healthy longer than most industry officials expected.    For Arco, the decision to drop leaded and add a new unleaded grade is a calculated risk. The West Coast market is large and fast-growing. California alone accounts for 11% of all U.S. gasoline sales, and in the past four years the state's overall gasoline demand has increased at almost twice the national rate.    Arco competes with other major marketers by having the cheapest gas on the block. And its leaded gasoline, usually its price leader, makes up a larger portion of its sales than it does at other companies. In Los Angeles, 17.4% of Arco's business is leaded gasoline, while at Chevron Corp. the share is only 12.4% and at Shell Oil Co. it's 12.8%.    The company is apparently betting that it can continue to attract older-car owners with a new unleaded with adequate octane and moderate price, and at the same time undercut its rivals in the unleaded premium market.    Arco dealers are expecting an 88-octane midgrade unleaded, very close to the rating of leaded regular and also suitable for many of the West Coast newer cars now using unleaded premium. The midgrade could be as much as a dime a gallon cheaper than these premiums, offering a money-saving choice these buyers now don't have.    Outside of the West, such buying-down has been going on with a vengeance in the wake of the spring's sharp run-up in all gasoline prices. Arco also tries to undercut its competitors with a premium unleaded at 91 octane, slightly below the rating -- and price -- of many other major brands.    &quot;This is similar to when Arco dropped its credit card in 1982,&quot; said McDonald J. Beavers, president of Whitney Leigh Corp., a Tulsa gasoline industry survey firm. &quot;They're going to turn their backs somewhat on regular leaded customers and lose some of that, but they feel they can more than make up for it.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
