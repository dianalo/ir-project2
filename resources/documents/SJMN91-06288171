A little surprised maybe.;   &quot;Idon't know that it's unbelievable,&quot; Snyder said after Cal's 45-7 win overOregon on Saturday. &quot;I thought we had a chance, but it's only a chance. We hadtwo games where it easily could have gone the other way. But I'm reallypleased with it and pleased with this team. We have the heart of a team thatshould be 5-0.&quot;;   Next, of course, is Washington on Saturday in Berkeley.That will be the true test for Cal.;   Snyder said: &quot;We're playing here. We'replaying . . . against maybe the best team in the country. I've not seeneveryone, but it might be the best team in the country. It's a greatopportunity, regardless of how it turns out.&quot;;   Representatives from theAloha, Copper, Fiesta and Freedom bowls watched Cal's victory over Oregon fromthe Memorial Stadium press box.; RECORD DIDN'T AFFECT RECEIVER;   Princeton'sMichael Lerch didn't care about breaking the NCAA record for receiving yardsin a game. Neither did Coach Steve Tosches, who took Lerch out of the game forthe final possession.;   &quot;The most important thing was the victory,&quot; Lerchsaid after catching nine passes for an NCAA-tying 370 yards in Saturday's59-37 win over Brown in Providence, R.I. &quot;I wouldn't have wanted him to put meback in the game just for the record. I wanted to win the game.&quot;;   Lerch, theTigers' split end, tied the record set by Barry Wagner of Alabama Aandamp;M twoyears ago against Clark College. He broke the Division I-AA record of 327yards set by Rhode Island's Brian Forster against Brown on Sept. 28, 1985. Healso set a I-AA record for all-purpose yards (463).;   Tosches said he didn'tknow Lerch had a chance to break the mark. But he added: &quot;Besides, we got whatwe came here for. We wanted the win.
