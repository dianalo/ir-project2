The soon-to-expire September contract closed at $398.40 an ounce, down $6.90 from Tuesday. The more actively traded October delivery dropped to $397 before recovering to end at $399.20, down $7. The December delivery, currently the most actively traded, declined to another life-of-contract low of $402.50 before rising slightly to end at $404, down $7.30.    The last time gold futures were below $400 was Feb. 19, 1987, when the February 1987 contract traded at $393.    Gold led the other precious metals lower. December silver fell 7.7 cents an ounce to $6.28 and October platinum settled with a loss of $9.80 an ounce at $485.10. These two metals followed gold, falling and then recovering slightly toward the close, analysts said.    &quot;There are three dominating factors in the market that have come together at this time and have created a major depressing force,&quot; said William O'Neill, research director for Elders Futures Inc., New York. &quot;They are a lack of investor demand for physical metal, the absence of significant inflation, and a technical, or chart, picture, that indicates lower prices for precious metals,&quot; he said.    Some &quot;bargain hunting&quot; buying has been evident, Mr. O'Neill said, but it has been more than offset by selling. The sellers include both precious-metals producers and &quot;tired longs&quot; -- traders who bought contracts some time ago in hopes of rising prices but now have become discouraged.    Bernard Savaiko, a senior precious metals analyst for PaineWebber Inc., New York, said that there isn't sufficient bargain-hunting to trigger a turnaround.    &quot;Bargain hunters are weak buyers -- that is, they're willing to buy on the way down if the price is low enough, but they flee when it tends to steady or recover,&quot; he said. &quot;In order to rebound, the market needs buyers who will continue to buy as prices rise.&quot;    Mr. Savaiko said silver is laboring under burdensome supplies. Inventories of silver in warehouses of New York's Commodity Exchange have risen to a record level of 179.8 million ounces, he said, following increases of 1.4 million ounces on Tuesday and 872,000 ounces on Monday.    Meanwhile, an apparent difference of opinion surfaced in the gold market. While the majority of investors are ignoring bullion, equally smart or smarter money was seeking to buy gold at the corporate level.    Minorco S.A., a Luxembourg holding company, made a $3.44 billion takeover bid for Consolidated Gold Fields PLC, which rejected the offer.    Why is gold attractive in one form and not another? &quot;Gold corporations are very profitable even if prices for the metal are depressed, and I can see more interest in buying gold producers,&quot; said Ian MacDonald, vice president, Credit Suisse, New York.    Mr. MacDonald noted that mining companies can produce gold at about $125 an ounce in the U.S. and at a comparable cost elsewhere.    &quot;New technology is helping to produce gold at lesser cost, and even if increased production is helping to depress prices to some degree, it is favoring the companies that produce it,&quot; Mr. MacDonald said.    In other commodity markets yesterday:   COPPER: Futures prices declined on profit-taking following recent advances. December delivery copper ended at $1.0100 a pound, for a loss of 2.60 cents. Copper was a victim of a sharp drop in the price of aluminum and a weakness in precious metals prices. These factors, one analyst said, &quot;provided an excuse for a correction from the recent rally,&quot; in which the December price rose 19.30 cents from Aug. 1 to Sept. 14. Since then the market has had difficulty sustaining advances, he said. However, the analyst noted, while December delivery was off 2.60 cents yesterday, the expiring September contract fell only 1.55 cents, ending at $1.1230. This caused the premium of September over December to expand by 1.05 cents from Tuesday to 11.30 cents, despite a declining market. &quot;The strength of September indicates a continuing tightness of supplies and that there has been no change in the strong fundamentals that have recently helped the market to rise,&quot; he said.    COCOA: Futures prices extended Tuesday's advances. December delivery cocoa ended $32 a metric ton higher at $1,235. According to one analyst, there were no new developments and the market simply was rebounding from an oversold condition. Another analyst said that producing countries, which had recently contributed to the weakness by selling cocoa, had withdrawn from the market and this also helped prices rise. He added that most of the bad news in the market is already out and that could have been a supporting factor as well. He was referring to the burdensome supplies of cocoa and the failure of the International Cocoa Organization to agree upon a means of supporting cocoa prices at its just-completed meeting in London.    GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Futures prices rose in quiet trading. With few developments, traders concentrated on reports that U.S. officials briefed farm group representatives Tuesday on the status of negotiations over a new grain pact with the Soviet Union. Talks between Soviet and U.S. trade negotiators ended last week in Geneva without resolving several key issues. Although a new grain agreement is expected to be signed, there is growing speculation that it won't be completed before the current five-year pact expires Sept. 30. The pact requires the Soviet Union to buy nine million metric tons of grain annually. Traders are speculating that U.S. negotiators are asking that the Soviets purchase 50 million to 55 million metric tons under a new five-year pact. There is also speculation that the Soviets wouldn't be required to buy a minimum annual amount. </TEXT></DOC>
