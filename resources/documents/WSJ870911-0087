The five ministers -- from Algeria, Indonesia, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela -- refused to single out any overproducers among the 13 OPEC countries. And they admitted they don't really know how much more oil is being produced than called for under OPEC's second-half ceiling of 16.6 million barrels a day.    &quot;One estimate is as good as another,&quot; said Rilwanu Lukman of Nigeria, OPEC's president. &quot;Some say three million barrels a day,&quot; he added, &quot;but we think it's much less than that.&quot;    Nonetheless, Mr. Lukman and the four other ministers he summoned to the meeting of OPEC's pricing and producing committees agreed last night to send a delegation of three to meet with heads of state of all 13 OPEC countries. The delegation -- which will be made up of Mr. Lukman and ministers of Venezuela and Indonesia -- will urge compliance with OPEC's pricing and producing agreement of last December.    The five ministers will meet again today to set the dates for the visits of this so-called quota-discipline committee.    OPEC specialists, including some of the ministers at yesterday's meeting, expressed doubts that this step will be strong enough to calm oil markets, which have become jittery over the gusher of petroleum coming out of the OPEC countries.    If overproduction continues, said one of the ministers, world oil prices, which have been hovering slightly above OPEC's base price of $18 a barrel, will go down.    But even as the ministers were meeting, there were indications that OPEC's production already is beginning to drop as a result of market forces. It was learned, for example, that the companies purchasing oil from Saudi Arabia, OPEC's largest producer, are requesting 20% less oil in October than they have been taking since the beginning of August, when they boosted purchases to rebuild inventories and because of unrest in the Persian Gulf.    And one of the oil men who frequently shows up at OPEC meetings, Oscar Wyatt, chairman of Coastal Corp., said that Coastal has been storing up oil and probably won't need to buy more for several weeks. Oil markets, he said, &quot;are on a razor's edge&quot; because of excess production that could cause prices to fall in the months ahead.    Moreover, because a stronger effort wasn't made to reduce OPEC production, &quot;most likely I won't be putting many ships (to transport oil) in the water,&quot; Mr. Wyatt said.    Mr. Wyatt was here to confer with a group from Iran -- which has been selling oil to Coastal -- a group whose very appearance was unexpected. Kazempour Ardebili, deputy oil minister, explained that he only wanted to advise the ministers of Iran's views about current OPEC production levels, which he estimated have declined to between 17.5 million and 17.8 million barrels a day.    Although the Iranian didn't participate in last night's meeting, he said he told Mr. Lukman that he wanted the pricing and production committees to come up with a &quot;plan of action&quot; to curb overproduction among the Arab countries around the Persian Gulf, including the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait. He also said that in Iran's view, Saudi Arabia should resume its former role as OPEC's &quot;swing&quot; producer -- dropping its output at critical points such as this -- and that it should also put pressure on Iraq to reduce production.    Both the warring nations of Iran and Iraq, which refuses to accept an OPEC quota much less to abide by one, are understood to be overproducers. But most others are exceeding their quotas, too, OPEC sources said.    Statistics on just how much oil is pouring out of OPEC vary widely because figures reported by many of the member nations are suspect. &quot;There's a high degree of 'guesstimate,'&quot; said Indonesian oil minister Subroto. &quot;And we don't know what production is.&quot;    But most of the ministers insisted that industry estimates by the International Energy Agency and some others, which put OPEC production for August at 19.7 million barrels a day, are too high. Actual OPEC production, Arturo Hernandez Grisanti of Venezuela told reporters, &quot;is less than you think.&quot;    Because of the uncertainties surrounding weekly production reports from member countries, OPEC's Vienna secretariat provided the ministerial committees with two sets of production figures. Using outside sources, the secretariat submitted production figures of 18.2 million barrels a day to 18.4 millions barrels for July and 19.3 million barrels a day to 19.7 million barrels for August.    But from internal figures, based on what OPEC members reported, the secretariat's second list calculated production for July at 17.4 million barrels a day and for August at 17.8 million barrels a day. The ministers decided, sources said, that the &quot;truth&quot; lies somewhere between.    The ministers also discussed prices, said Belkacem Nabi of Algeria, but concluded that spot and futures prices currently are &quot;maybe a few cents above&quot; OPEC's official prices. As a result, he said, the ministers decided further action wasn't necessary unless spot and futures prices deteriorated sharply. If spot prices were to drop below official OPEC prices and remained there for a long time, &quot;then, of course, we have some problems,&quot; said Subroto, the Indonesian minister.    The five-minister group had been authorized by OPEC to call a special meeting of all 13 countries if world oil prices got much out of line with those of the cartel. But the ministers ruled out the holding of a full conference prior to a regular meeting currently scheduled for Dec. 9. OPEC sources suggested that such a special meeting of all the oil ministers would be too risky at this time because of the escalation of the Persian Gulf conflict and the deterioration in relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia in the wake of the recent Mecca incident.    OPEC sources admitted that the failure to call a special meeting may be interpreted in the oil markets as a signal of weakness by the cartel. Offsetting this, however, is the indicated decline in OPEC production that is already taking place, the sources said. </TEXT></DOC>
