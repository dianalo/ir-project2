ProfitIncreased 33%In Third Quarter---By Carol HymowitzStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 10/13/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> NCREARNINGS (ERN)COMPUTERS (EDP) </IN><TEXT>   NCR Corp., bolstered by strong orders for its personal computers, improved profit margins and the weak dollar, posted a 33% jump in third-quarter net income on a 14% revenue gain.    In the quarter, the Dayton, Ohio-based maker of computers and business information-processing equipment earned $97.8 million, or $1.05 a share, compared with $73.4 million, or 75 cents a share, a year earlier. The average number of shares outstanding decreased to 93.5 million from 98.4 million.    Revenue rose to $1.34 billion from $1.18 billion. The after-tax profit margin increased to 13.4% from 11.3% in the year-earlier period.    NCR tied its large earnings increase to revenue growth, especially in its European operations, and to &quot;lower sales and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue.&quot; NCR has been selling a greater percentage of its computers to large businesses and to &quot;third parties who do the marketing for them and save them costs,&quot; said Steven Milunovich of First Boston Corp., New York. As a result, &quot;Their margins are improving,&quot; he noted.    The company also benefited from the weakening dollar, which has lowered the cost of U.S. products abroad. NCR derives more than half its revenue from overseas operations. Donald Young, analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co., New York, estimated that the weak dollar accounted for almost half the revenue increase in the quarter. &quot;Everything is going great for NCR, but the dollar is the single most important factor behind their gains,&quot; he said.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, NCR shares fell $3.125 to close at $75.625, with 966,000 shares changing hands.    Barry Bosak, analyst at Eberstadt Fleming Inc. in New York, said, &quot;The stock had been unusually strong in the last few weeks, so this drop could be an adjustment.&quot; Other analysts said the drop was perplexing because the quarter's earnings met or surpassed expectations.    NCR's chairman and president, Charles E. Exley Jr., said the company posted strong gains in orders in most major product categories. &quot;Of particular significance is the near doubling of year-to-date personal computer orders,&quot; he said. Indeed, the latest quarter was the first in which the company posted a profit from its personal computer business.    NCR recently expanded its personal computer line with three new computers and a workstation, including one based on Intel Corp.'s powerful 80386 microprocessor. Production of the machines &quot;is limited, but that will be overcome, and the products are being shipped,&quot; Mr. Exley said.    The company's self-service financial terminals -- or automated banking machines -- and the NCR Tower family of supermicrocomputers also were &quot;major contributors&quot; to the record order levels, he said.    First Boston's Mr. Milunovich said, &quot;If there's a risk for NCR, it's in how well the market will accept the company's new products.&quot; He said that NCR's 7000 line of terminals -- used by retailers and the food industry -- and its 9800 mainframes &quot;are selling a little below expectations. But they're still doing better than the average computer company,&quot; he added.    Net income in the nine months rose 27% to $257.9 million, or $2.74 a share, from $202.5 million, or $2.05 a share. Average shares outstanding decreased to 94.2 million from 98.9 million. Revenue for the period advanced 16% to $3.82 billion from $3.31 billion </TEXT></DOC>
