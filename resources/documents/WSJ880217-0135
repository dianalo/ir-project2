The textile company said that when it completes the sale, expected by March 25, it will have sold a total of $650 million of assets since its $2.16 billion buy-out in September by a Morgan Stanley andamp; Co.-led group.    Porcher Textile, a French glass-fabrics maker, will buy the Burlington unit. Glass fabrics, woven from glass, carbon fibers and a synthetic material, are used in electronics, insulation, filters and commercial markets.    Burlington's glass-fabrics division, based in Greensboro, N.C., has plants in Cheraw, S.C., and Altavista and South Hill, Va. Burlington said Banque Nationale de Paris's New York branch has committed itself to provide funds to complete the transaction.    Burlington said the unit had sales of $117.6 million in the year ended Sept. 30. </TEXT></DOC>
