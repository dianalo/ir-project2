 And the guests, in the form of 1-2-3enhancement products, keep right on coming.andM;There are about 1,000 add-ins, templates, and assorted other enhancementsavailable for 1-2-3, according to a conservative count by Lotus DevelopmentCorp.andP;  The quantity of enhancement products, however, is not nearly asimpressive as what they can do.andP;  They help you analyze and experiment, expandand connect, distill and debug, polish and print.andP;  Most are downright useful.andO;Of course, some are dumb, some are only moderately useful, and some don'twork as advertised.andM;We sought out the best 1-2-3 enhancements and came up with a baker's dozen ofthe cleverest products on the market--at least in the subjective views ofexperts, analysts, publishers, journalists, and users.andP;  Our poll wasinformal, but we found that there are informed opinions out there, and, to adegree, some consensus about 1-2-3's best friends.andM;Some of the titles that appear on our list, such as Sideways, are by 1-2-3standards oldies but goodies.andP;  Others, such as Macro Editor/Debugger fromPersonics, are relatively new.andP;  Most are best-sellers, which reflects 1-2-3users' similar basic needs.andP;  Some very good, popular products didn't make ourlist but easily could have.andP;  Some were runners-up to similar products that wechose: Impress edged Allways; What-If Solver nosed What'sBest!; Baler toppedKing Jaguar; and ForeCalc beat Forecast!.andP;  Other honorable mentions go to@Base, Rescue Plus, Randamp;R Worksheet Report Writer, and Ready-To-Run Accounting.andO;Not surprisingly, most of the nominations we received were for products withbroad appeal--&quot;horizontal&quot; products, in marketing lingo.andP;  But many peoplealso sang the praises of specific, &quot;vertical&quot; products such as @functionlibraries offered by Grey-Matter International, Intex, and others.andO;Surprising is the absence of word processing or graphing add-ins from ourroster of nominees.andM;There were several interesting entries.andP;  Lotus's GraphWriter and Magellan,though not really 1-2-3 enhancements, each garnered a mention.andP;  So did Add-InToolkit for Release 3, which makes it easier for people to write add-ins oftheir own.andM;Most of the people we contacted use at least one enhancement product, but fewload more than two because of memory constraints.andP;  &quot;People run out of memorylong before they run out of money or interest,&quot; notes Allen Moulton, aresearcher at MIT and director of the 3,000-member Boston Computer Society'sLotus user group, and others agree.andP;  Fortunately, one of our 13 eliteenhancements--Beyond 640--helps alleviate the memory crunch.andM;And the winners are:andM;SIDEWAYSandM;If the 1-2-3 enhancement market is old enough to have a classic product, thatproduct is Sideways.andP;  And as with classic Coca-Cola, the public isn't readyjust yet to forsake this venerable add-in for anything new.andM;Sideways invented the formula for success: Find something 1-2-3 doesn't dothat people want to do, do it, then make it a snap to use.andP;  In the case ofSideways, that something is printing spreadsheets lengthwise across one ormore pages--cleanly, legibly, and efficiently.andP;  Sure, landscape printing isstandard operating procedure for laser printers, but dot-matrix sales arestill climbing.andP;  And Sideways works even faster with a new add-in printspooler from Funk Software called P.D.Queue.andP;  So much for early retirement.andM;&quot;I think there's always a place for an add-in that's small and fast and doeswhat it's supposed to, and Sideways still fits that mold,&quot; notes JerryLerman, an independent software developer who coauthored several add-inproducts marketed by Personics, including SeeMore and Lookandamp;Link.andM;Sideways (Funk Software, 222 Third St., Cambridge, MA 02142; 617-497-6339).andO;Works with Releases 2.x and 3.x.andM;SQZ!andP;  PLUSandM;If you're one of those people who enjoys playing around with new software,savor your early moments with SQZ!andP;  Plus--you may never have to see it again.andO;&quot;The best part is once you install it, it works automatically--you don't haveto teach anybody anything, and it doesn't interfere with anything else,&quot;explains Bill Weil, a computer consultant in the San Francisco area whodevelops 1-2-3 spreadsheet models and training courses.andM;SQZ!andP;  Plus works in the background to automatically compress a spreadsheetfile as it is saved, reducing it to less than one-tenth its original size insome cases.andP;  Then it &quot;unsqueezes&quot; the file as you load it.andP;  The program hasother valuable, visible qualities, too.andP;  You can back up a file from within1-2-3 or recover a damaged file, for example.andP;  But the main appeal of SQZ!andO;Plus is its ability to lighten the burden on a hard disk without putting anyadditional burden on the user.andM;SQZ!andP;  Plus (Symantec Corp., 135 South Rd., Bedford, MA 01730; 617-275-4800).andO;Works with Release 2.x.andM;SEEMOREandM;Simple problems deserve simple, elegant solutions.andP;  SeeMore provides them.andO;SeeMore is an add-in &quot;screen manager&quot; that can double, triple, or evenquadruple the number of cells that 1-2-3 displays on the screen atonce--without affecting the way 1-2-3 operates.andM;You can quickly change display modes as you work, and create multiple windowson the screen to see several worksheet sections or graphs together.andP;  On EGAand VGA monitors, you can set screen colors, as well.andP;  SeeMore doesn't buymore screen space; it just makes everything smaller so that you can put moreinto what you have.andM;&quot;It's an excellent idea and a very good implementation,&quot; says Sidewayscreator Paul Funk.andP;  SeeMore is the only product other than his own that hepersonally uses.andP;  &quot;We kicked ourselves a bit for not thinking of it first,&quot;he says.andM;SeeMore (Personics Corp., 63 Great Rd., Maynard, MA 01754; 508-897-1575).andO;Works with Release 2.x.andM;IMPRESSandM;For 1-2-3 users, spreadsheet publishing has been a term defined mainly by thepresentation-quality output of Allways.andP;  Today it's defined by the output andgraphical interface of Impress.andM;Impress employs a &quot;live&quot; what-you-see-is-what-you-get interface that not onlydisplays fonts and graphics together on the screen but enables you tointeract with 1-2-3 without reverting back to 1-2-3's standardcharacter-based mode.andP;  You can also use a mouse to gain access to 1-2-3 menuchoices and to move around the worksheet.andM;Version 2 of Impress works with more fonts, colors, and graphics formats thanversion 1, plus a few features found in other add-ins, including sidewaysprinting on laser printers, extended row-and-column display, and limited wordprocessing.andP;  Print output with the second release is much sharper and clearerthan the first.andM;Lotus was impressed enough to include Impress technology in Release 3.1.andO;&quot;Impress just feels and appears more natural [than Allways],&quot; explains BillZeigler, an information systems manager and leader of the Lotus specialinterest group (SIG) at the Chicago Computer Society.andP;  &quot;You can get goodoutput with either one, but you don't have to muscle Impress as much.&quot;andM;Impress (PC Publishing, 1801 Avenue of the Stars, #815, Los Angeles, CA90067; 213-556-3630) Works with Release 2.x; some of the technology isincluded in Release 3.1.andM;MACRO EDITOR/DEBUGGERandM;There are no conspicuous holes left to fill in 1-2-3, right?andP;  Anyone who'sspent an hour or more combing through his or her macro code to figure outwhere they went wrong might beg to differ.andM;That's where a new add-in called Macro Editor/Debugger, or ME/D, comes in.andO;ME/D's interactive Debugger window pops up on screen and takes you throughyour macro code--one instruction at a time, one cell at a time, or fullspeed--and spots error conditions.andP;  When an error is detected, you can moveto the Editor window to correct the problem (the detailed explanations oferror messages in the user's manual should help), then jump back to theDebugger to pick up where you left off.andP;  The Debugger's pointer, along withpreset &quot;breakpoints&quot; and &quot;watchpoints,&quot; makes it easy to maneuver your waythrough macros, too.andM;&quot;I don't think everybody is going to need it, but for those who do need it,it's going to be a godsend,&quot; says Don Selesky, an independent add-indeveloper whose credits include @Base and Look andamp;Link.andM;Macro Editor/Debugger (Personics Corp.).andP;  Works with Release 2.x.andM;@EASEandM;When you spend a good part of the day inside a spreadsheet, the littlefrustrations in labeling, formatting, and calculating can become bigheadaches.andP;  Think of @Ease as aspirin for worksheet warriors.andM;@Ease is a collection of add-in @functions that alleviate the angst involvedin performing seemingly simple tasks, such as entering a series ofconsecutive dates, figuring subtotals and grand totals, and centering aheading over a data range.andP;  @Ease expedites these and other potentiallyexasperating chores.andP;  It's the art of the mundane, to be sure, but you mayfind yourself whispering, &quot;thank you, thank you&quot; before long.andM;&quot;It's one of those products that does some incredibly useful, commonly neededthings,&quot; says Lotus's Kenneth Lownie, a member of the developer marketinggroup.andM;@Ease (Spreadsheet Solutions, 600 Old Country Rd., Garden City, NY 11530;516-222-1429).andP;  Works with Releases 2.x and 3.x.andM;WHAT-IF SOLVERandM;Remember those confounding equations from your math textbooks that alwaysbegan something like &quot;If apples cost 5 cents, and oranges cost 7 cents, howmuch money will Jane need to buy...&quot;?andP;  To a second- or third-grader, it couldbe a mind-boggling problem.andP;  The trouble is things don't get any simpler inthe real world of business, where how you mix your apples and oranges canresult in a profit or loss.andM;What-If Solver, a goal-seeking and optimization analysis add-in similar tothe Solver function in 1-2-3/G, can help.andP;  Basically, you mark some cells inyour 1-2-3 worksheet as variable or &quot;what if&quot; cells, others as limiter or&quot;constraint&quot; cells, and in some cases, one as an &quot;optimum&quot; cell to beminimized or maximized.andP;  What-If Solver then finds the values that producethe optimal solution.andP;  What-If Solver can handle problems that extend beyondthe scope of either simple goal seekers (such as its related product, What-IfAnalyst) or linear optimizers (such as What'sBest!).andM;What-If Solver (Frontline Systems, 140 University Ave., Suite 100, Palo Alto,CA 94301; 415-327-7297).andP;  Works with Releases 2.x and 3.x.andM;FORECALCandM;There may be few guarantees in life, but there are plenty of forecasts.andP;  Andwhile some forecasters gaze into crystal balls, 1-2-3 users tend to prefer amore scientific approach, such as the one in ForeCalc.andM;ForeCalc is a business forecasting add-in that enables you to project futureactivity based on historical data, such as sales figures or expenses, thatyou've already entered in your worksheets.andP;  ForeCalc is particularly easy touse because it assumes you know little or nothing about statistics orforecasting techniques.andP;  The program automatically selects the appropriateforecasting method based on the patterns it finds in your data, then does itsthing.andP;  However, you can exercise more control over the process if you wantto.andM;&quot;It was everything we imagined a forecasting program should be, and it'scompletely automatic,&quot; notes Dan Fylstra, president of Frontline.andM;ForeCalc (Business Forecast Systems, 68 Leonard St., Belmont, MA 02178;617-484-5050).andP;  Works with Releases 2.x and 3.x.andM;BALERandM;Creating a 1-2-3 application simple enough for other people to use is alwaysa tricky proposition and sometimes a risky one because the formulas andmacros can be changed inadvertently or deliberately.andP;  But Baler 5.0 addressesboth the simplicity and the security issues.andM;Baler is a spreadsheet compiler that enables you to create from 1-2-3spreadsheets stand-alone, self-running applications to distribute or sell(royalty-free) to others.andP;  Version 5.0 lets you use virtually all of 1-2-3'scapabilities.andP;  Baler also adds some nice touches: You can add pull-downmenus, color, and context-sensitive help to your compiled applications tomake them easier to use and more attractive.andP;  But it's the capability ofmaking formulas and macros untouchable that appeals to many business-people.andM;&quot;There's a lot of interest in compilers because security is a big concern andthere's very little security built into a 1-2-3 worksheet,&quot; reports MarkGruner, a Dallas-based financial analyst who heads the Lotus SIG at the NorthTexas PC Users Group.andP;  &quot;With Baler, I can control the level of protection,&quot;he says.andM;Baler (Baler Software Corp., 1400 Hicks Rd., Rolling Meadows, IL 60008;708-506-9700).andP;  Works with Release 2.x.andM;BUDGET EXPRESSandM;Budgeting in a spreadsheet is often one part number crunching and two partsarranging and formatting.andP;  1-2-3 can handle all of the crunching, of course,and The Budget Express can handle just about everything else.andM;The Budget Express organizes the rows of budget line items into an outlineformat, which not only imposes some discipline on the process of enteringitems but makes them easier to find and analyze later.andP;  The program is fullof shortcuts and formatting helpers and lets you consolidate data fromsimilar worksheets, as well.andP;  But it's the &quot;spreadsheet outlining&quot; system,with rows and columns that collapse and expand to hide or show detail, thatdraws the loudest raves.andM;&quot;That's what I really love about The Budget Express--the ability to see boththe big and the little pictures,&quot; says Jack McGrath, editor and publisher of@Max, a Hingham, Mass.-based monthly newsletter for 1-2-3 users.andP;  &quot;People whodo budgeting just go wild when I show them that.&quot;andM;The Budget Express (Symantec Corp.).andP;  Works with Release 2.x.andM;BEYOND 640andM;Expanded memory has been a mildly cruel joke for many 1-2-3 users, some ofwhom discovered after adding megabytes of memory to their PCs that Release2.x can use but a small portion of the added RAM.andP;  The problem is the way1-2-3 uses conventional memory; the solution is Beyond 640.andM;Ordinarily, 1-2-3 keeps its invisible cell pointers, which tell the programwhere everything's located, strictly in conventional memory (memory up to640K).andP;  That's a problem, because cell pointers can consume a third or moreof the memory space needed to store a spreadsheet.andP;  When there's no room forany more cell pointers, you're left staring at an Out of memory message,regardless of how much expanded memory is available.andP;  Beyond 640automatically moves 1-2-3 spreadsheets, cell pointers and all, into expandedmemory (expanded memory specification 3.2 or 4.0) as needed.andP;  That enablesyou to tap up to 4 megabytes of expanded memory for huge worksheets, and itfrees up conventional memory for such things as pop-up programs and add-ins.andO;&quot;Beyond 640 is a genuinely exciting product because it addresses a veryserious problem,&quot; says Eric Wolfe, a 1-2-3 macro developer who hasencountered memory problems in his work for business clients.andP;  &quot;This is oneadd-in I'll actually use.&quot;andM;Beyond 640 (Intex Solutions, 161 Highland Ave., Needham, MA 02194;617-449-6222).andP;  Works with Release 2.x.andM;LOOKandamp;LINKandM;If you think the linking capabilities in Release 2.2 are nice, you ought tosee--quite literally--what you've been missing with Lookandamp;Link.andM;In addition to enabling you to forge connections between separate worksheets,Lookandamp;Link lets you see a second spreadsheet while still working in the first,so you're not flying blind when comparing or connecting spreadsheets.andP;  Youcan't make any changes to this second sheet, but you can cut and paste datafrom the &quot;browse window&quot; into your current work.andP;  Lookandamp;Link is better atlinking than 1-2-3 Release 2.2 because it lets you include a link in aformula and create links to multiple cells.andM;But even if you buy Lookandamp;Link for it good connections rather than its goodlooks, it's likely that, like spreadsheet guru and writer Craig Stinson,you'll find yourself using the program &quot;much more for looking than linking.&quot;andM;Lookandamp;Link (Personics Corp.).andP;  Works with Release 2.x.andM;WORKSHEETandM;UTILITIESandM;If there's a Norton Utilities or PC Tools for a spreadsheet users, it's TheWorksheet Utilities, a versatile collection of worksheet-editing andfile-management tools.andM;There are lots of reasons to love The Worksheet Utilities.andP;  The ability tosearch and replace labels and formulas is one; another reason is the &quot;autosave&quot; function for automatically backing up worksheets.andP;  But its two mostalluring features are probably its Formula Editor and its File Manager.andP;  TheEditor helps you in creating changing and even debugging formulas, while theManager helps you samely organize an ever-growing pile of spreadsheet files,in part by adding explanatory tags to file names.andM;&quot;It's awfully nice to be able to annotate files when you work with 200 or 300of them,&quot; notes @MAX's Jack McGrath.andM;The Worksheet Utilities (FUnk Software).andP;  Works with Release 2.x.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
