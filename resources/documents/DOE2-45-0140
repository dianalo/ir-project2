One obviousreason for this is that in the USA the public takes an active role inutility planning at public hearings. Other factors are difficult to determinebecause of differences in organisation and structure of the UK and USAindustries.

In the USA, a commissioner is either appointedor elected to regulate public services such as electricity. The dutiesof the regulator include: granting exclusive licences to operate; establishingservice boundaries; laying down the terms of the required obligationto serve all consumers; setting retail rates and tariff provisions; andmediation in the case of consumer complaints. The prices charged forelectricity by the investor-owned utilities are controlled by 'rate-of-return'regulation. Commissioners have also been involved in promoting energyefficiency, conservation and load management, and have initiated somecontrol over utilities' long-range plans and demand side programmes.</TEXT></DOC>
