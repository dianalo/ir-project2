Theauthors have used x-ray diffraction and electron microscopy to studythe molecular organization and morphology of macromolecular assembliesformed by three synthetic peptides homologous to {beta} protein of brainamyloid: {beta}-(1-28), residues 1-28 of the {beta} protein; [Ala{sup1-}{beta}-(1-28), {beta}-(1-28) with alanine substituted for lysine atposition 16; and {beta}-(18-28), residues 18-28 of the {beta} protein.{beta}-(1-28) readily formed fibrils in vitro that were similar in ultrastructureto the in vivo amyloid and aggregated into large bundles resembling thoseof senile plaque cores. X-ray patterns from partially dried, orientedpellets showed a cross-{beta}-conformation. [Ala{sup 16}]{beta}-(1-28)formed {beta}-pleated sheet assemblies that were dissimilar to in vivofibrils. The width of the 10-A spacing indicated stacks of about sixsheets. Thus, substitution of the uncharged alanine for the positivelycharged lysine in the {beta}-strand region enhances the packing of thesheets and dramatically alters the type of macromolecular aggregate formed.{Beta}-(18-28) formed assemblies that had even a greater number of stackedsheets. The findings on these homologous synthetic assemblies help todefine the specific sequence that is required to form Alzheimer's-typeamyloid fibrils, thus providing an in vitro model of age-related cerebralamyloidogenesis.</TEXT></DOC>
