In 1987, Borland purchased the Paradox data-baseprogram, which it successfully pitted against dBASE.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Business  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  BORLAND AGREES TO TAKE OVER ASHTON-TATE  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Philippe Kahn, Borland's chairman, president and chief executive officer,said: &quot;This transaction will allow us to provide a full range of softwareproducts -- from data bases and spreadsheets to graphics and programminglanguages. . . . We intend to protect customer investments in each company'sproducts.&quot;;    Borland spokesman Dick O'Donnell said that Ashton-Tate offerednot only a large established customer base, but strong support amongindependent programmers who write custom data base programs, and a strongforeign presence.;    Because dBASE's substantial number of users are notidentical to those of Paradox, the merged company would &quot;continue to enhance&quot;the MS-DOS versions of both products, according to O'Donnell. A mergedprogram, if it were developed, would be written for some other operatingsystem.;    Ashton-Tate, which has stumbled in recent years and ended lastyear in the red, is currently involved in a legal fight over crucial copyrightprotections on its dBASE family of computer programs. A recent legal rulingdid not settle the key question in the case, which is whether Fox SoftwareInc. of Perrysburg, Ohio, and the Santa Cruz Operation of Santa Cruz illegallycopied the &quot;look and feel&quot; of dBASE.;    O'Donnell said he didn't know if themerged companies would continue the legal fight, although Borland hasreportedly been working on its own &quot;work-alike&quot; version of dBASE.;    Borlandhas been growing in recent years and is in the process of building a newcorporate headquarters on a 200-acre site along Highway 17 in Scotts Valley.;   Borland, with 1,000 employees -- 700 locally -- earned $26.8 million in itsfiscal year ended March 31. That came on sales of $226.7 million.;    Bycontrast, Ashton-Tate lost $18.1 million in 1990 on sales of $230.5 million.;   Ashton-Tate has about 1,600 workers, including 200 at its local facility,which has been expanding in the past several months.;    O'Donnell said thatthe companies haven't determined whether the takeover will result in layoffs,but that they hoped the business combination would result in &quot;economies ofscale.&quot; O'Donnell wouldn't say if the merger would shift substantial numbersof Ashton-Tate employees to Silicon Valley.;    Ashton-Tate, traded in theover-the-counter market, jumped 5 to 16 1/4 in early trading.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  HAL KAHN AND RORY O'CONNOR, Mercury News Staff Writers  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910710  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1F  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  459  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday July 10, 199100192120,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
