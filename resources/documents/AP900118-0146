The United States and most other countries have joined in theban. Illegal slaughter of elephants has greatly reduced theirnumbers in recent years.   ``We're afraid Britain's action will collapse the wholeinternational agreement,'' said Dana Lauren West, a press officerfor the organization.   ``It's a shock, a complete reversal of the British position.They did it to protect Hong Kong's trade,'' Ms. West said.   China is due to take Hong Kong back from Britain in 1997, butBritain still acts for the colony in world affairs. Hong Kong isamong the leading processors of ivory.   ``They're sitting on 600 tons of it now,'' Ms. West said.   China opposed the trade ban from the start.   It was to go into effect on Thursday as a result of a vote lastOct. 17 by representatives of 103 governments meeting in Lausanne,Switzerland. All are members of the Convention on InternationalTrade in Endangered Species.   South Africa, Zimbabwe and Zambia also submitted``reservations'' _ in effect exempting themselves from the ban.They supply both raw and carved ivory. Ms. West said there was anunconfirmed report that they are now being joined by Botswana aswell as Britain. Member countries have until midnight Thursday tomake their decisions.   After that, environmentalists will have to get together, reviewthe effects of the defections amd decide what to do next, she added.   Japan and Singapore, which had been mainstays of the ivorytrade, have so far said they are ready to go along with the ban,Ms. West reported. The fund said in an earlier statement thatSingapore has several tons of stockpiled ivory and a flourshingindustry in carving it into goods for export.   Ms. West said that British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher onWednesday transferred authority on the issue from her EnvironmentMinistry to the Foreign Ministry, which submitted the Britishreservation.   ``Because Britain belongs to the European Economic Community,we're afraid it may serve as a funnel to the other countries,'' sheadded.   Goods flow with few restrictions among the 12 members of thecommunity, which include the main countries of Western Europe.   ``It's appalling,'' said Ginette Hemley, head of the fund's unitthat monitors trade in wildlife.   ``England's and China's decision ... is a green light to ivorypoachers. ... It's ironic that Great Britain, one of the firstEuropean countries to ban ivory, is the only Western nation tooppose the ... decision. While Japan, one of the largest consumercountries of ivory, has remained steadfast in its promise to upholdthe ban.''</TEXT></DOC>
