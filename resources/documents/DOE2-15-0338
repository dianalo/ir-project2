One source uses a high-densityactive core designed to reproduce the non-elliptical isodose curves characteristicof the traditional radium tube. The other source consists of two or threediscrete {sup 137}Cs seeds encapsulated in stainless steel. Using MonteCarlo dose-rate calculations as the standard of accuracy, we show thatthe Sievert model, using conventionally defined filtration corrections,overestimates kerma-rate in free space by as much as 20%. In addition,tissue attenuation and scatter build-up factors, derived from an isotropicpoint source, do not accurately characterize the distribution of scatterdose about heavily filtered sources. By varying the input parametersof the Sievert line-source integral so as to optimize its agreement withthe more rigorous Monte Carlo data, accuracy of 3% can be achieved.</TEXT></DOC>
