Unfortunately, the secret was unearthed in a tiny worm.But, the scientist suggested, his experiments indicate thatit may be possible someday to modify the aging process inother creatures, possibly including humans.</LP><TEXT>   The experiment &quot;says we're not stuck with it {aging} as itis; it is a biological process that we can do somethingabout,&quot; said Thomas E. Johnson, a molecular geneticist withthe Institute for Behavioral Genetics at the University ofColorado in Boulder.   In this week's issue of Science, Mr. Johnson reports thathe succeeded in mutating a single gene and thereby doublingthe maximum life span of a group of standard laboratoryworms, creating what might be called the Methuselahs of theannelid world.   The initial experiment actually was carried out four yearsago, Mr. Johnson said in a telephone interview. But, he said,he was so startled that a single gene mutation could havesuch a dramatic affect on the worms' life span that he waiteduntil he could replicate the experiment before publishing hisfinding. &quot;We've now replicated it more than 200 times,&quot; hesaid.   The experiments were part of a broader study of thegenetic underpinnings of aging. The focus was on the maximumlife of the creatures if biological aging were the only causeof death. This theoretical maximum life span is a calculationbased on the obvious fact that the older a group of creaturesgrows the higher the death rate. The maximum life span iscalculated by a formula, known as the Gompertz equation, inwhich one starts with the death rate of a species at pubertyand then determines how often the death rate doubles as thecreatures age.   For humans, for example, the death rate at puberty isabout two deaths per 10,000 persons per year. This ratedoubles every 7.5 to eight years thereafter. The Gompertzequation says that at this rate, 100% of the group will bedead in about 110 years. Hence, the maximum life span ofhumans is about 110 years.   The Colorado experiments were done in a roundworm known asCaenorhabditis elegans. It is found in the soil, is less than0.04 of an inch long and is composed of less than 1,000cells, Mr. Johnson said.   A few years ago, researchers found that mutations of asingle gene increased the maximum life span of the worms by60% to 110%. Mr. Johnson claims to be close to locating thegene, which has been dubbed the age-1 gene. In the newlyreported experiments, the aging of one strain of worms with amutant age-1 gene was slowed to the point that the death ratedoubled as infrequently as each 7.3 days instead of each 3.5to 4.5 days for normal worms used in the experiments. As aresult, the maximum life span of the mutant strain rose toabout 37 days from 21 to 23 days in the normal strains. Inanother mutant strain, the maximum life span was more thandoubled to 57 days by a mutation of the age-1 gene.</TEXT></DOC>
