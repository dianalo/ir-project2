Switching to substitutes and development of alternativeshas required detailed analysis to identify in the short to medium term,the most technically and economically efficient options. Results to dateindicate that areas where substitution is most readily achievable arecentralised medium to large scale electric power generation, direct useof electricity to replace oil usage, and direct use of substitute fuelssuch as coal and gas in process heat, steam generation etc. The developmentof oil products from alternative sources such as gasoline from naturalgas, oil from coal, ethanol from biomass and methanol from natural gas,whilst technically feasible, remain uneconomic at present. 1 fig., 3tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
