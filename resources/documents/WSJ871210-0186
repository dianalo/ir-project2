The biotechnology concern said it is continuing to work with BASF in developing a genetically engineered form of naturally occurring TPA, or tissue plasminogen activator, a substance that dissolves blood clots that cause heart attacks.    The naturally occurring form of TPA made with genetic engineering techniques by South San Francisco, Calif.-based Genentech Inc. recently was approved for marketing. Several companies are developing second generation forms of the drug, which are chemically altered versions that may be more effective than naturally occurring TPA.    A spokesman for Integrated Genetics said the biotechnology concern wants to develop its second generation TPA faster than does BASF, which is concentrating on bringing the two companies' first version of the drug to market.    Under their new agreement, both companies have rights to their jointly developed technology for second generation TPA. Integrated Genetics may seek another drug company partner or new financing to help in further development of its second generation TPA, the company spokesman said.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Integrated Genetics closed at $4.25, down 37.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
