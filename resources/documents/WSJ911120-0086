Earlier this month, a federal judge rebuked Goldman Sachsfor its actions in fighting one sex-discrimination case. Lastweek, a former Goldman investment banker sued the firm in NewYork state court seeking damages of $18 million after beingdenied a partnership. The banker, Rita M. Reid, alleges thata &quot;pattern and practice of sex discrimination&quot; exists at the6,000-employee firm.</LP><TEXT>   The lawsuits against Goldman have drawn attention on WallStreet because discrimination cases against brokerage firmshave historically been settled quietly, sometimes througharbitration. The fact that two suits have been filed recentlyagainst Goldman suggests the firm's internal method ofhandling such cases may not be as effective as those at otherfirms.   The issue is a particularly thorny one for Goldman. Thefirm has a poor record for promoting women, and it was stungby the resignation of a male partner in a widely publicizedsex scandal in late 1989.   Goldman -- one of Wall Street's most profitable andrespected firms, and its last major private partnership --has only four women among its 146 partners. But it says agrowing number of women have been promoted to middle-levelpositions and could become partners someday.   In the federal-court case, U.S. Magistrate Judge BarbaraA. Lee blasted the investment bank for not providing requireddocuments in a suit filed by Joanne Flynn, a 38-year-oldformer Goldman vice president. Ms. Flynn alleged that thefirm dismissed her from a supervisory post because of her sexand didn't pay her comparable compensation as her malecounterparts while she was at the firm. Goldman has deniedthe allegations and has asked that the suit be dismissed.   Judge Lee, in a harshly worded opinion, said it &quot;clearlyappears that documents of unquestioned relevance have beenwithheld or redacted solely on the basis of {Goldman's}unilateral and self-serving determinations of relevance.&quot;   The judge called Goldman's objections to producingdocuments surrounding Ms. Flynn's dismissal &quot;frivolous.&quot; Sheadded that the objections &quot;appear on their face to have beeninterposed solely for purposes of obstruction and delay,while also increasing the cost to plaintiff of pursuing thisaction.&quot;   A Goldman executive said the judge's decision &quot;doesn'treach to the merits of the case, which we firmly believe tobe nonexistent.&quot; A similar claim by Ms. Flynn before theEqual Employment Opportunity Commission was thrown out lastyear.   Ms. Flynn, who was dismissed from Goldman in 1989, nowruns a business consulting firm, according to her lawyer,Janet C. Neschis of Leavy Rosensweig andamp; Hyman in New York.   In the state court case, Ms. Reid, 40, accused Goldman ofunfairly denying her a partnership and firing her after 14years of employment. She is seeking $12 million in damagesfor &quot;loss of earnings and emotional distress&quot; and $6 millionin punitive damages.   The Goldman executive says Ms. Reid was dismissed&quot;following a fair evaluation of her performance and potentialin a changing business environment, including therestructuring of her group.&quot; The executive called Ms. Reid'sassertion that she should have been selected a partner&quot;preposterous,&quot; adding that &quot;she was never a seriouscandidate for partnership.&quot;   Ms. Reid was a vice president working on leveragedbuy-outs, mergers and other investment banking transactions.She says she received a bonus of $375,000 -- about five timesher base salary -- in 1989. Despite her success, she says inthe complaint, a male vice president with similar credentialsbut six fewer years of tenure was promoted to partner aheadof her and ahead of other women.   Ms. Reid also alleges that in August, when Goldmanreorganized its merchant-banking unit, every male got a newjob &quot;while the firm failed to find any other position&quot; forher.</TEXT></DOC>
