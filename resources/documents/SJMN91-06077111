Last year, the city council paid $4 million incomp time checks to officers, a move designed to put a lid on the overtimedebt.;    But last month, council members learned that the police departmenthad spent 80 percent of its $2.8 million overtime budget just halfway into thefiscal year. They ordered the department to cease authorizing paid overtime,forcing officers to take comp time.;    The nature of police work -- its24-hour-a-day pace plus the necessary report filing and court appearances --invariably leads to overtime.;    Protests triggered by the Persian Gulf warcost the San Francisco Police Department $100,000 a day in overtime.;   Unexpected overtime contributed to a $1 million deficit for the CaliforniaHighway Patrol, which has ordered officers to take comp time off rather thanreceive overtime pay.;    Sacramento has had to augment its police overtimebudget by $1.4 million during two of the past three years, despite addingofficers.;    &quot;Overtime is something that you can't avoid in any lawenforcement agency,&quot; said police management consultant Roland Dart, who servedas Vallejo's police chief.;    &quot;The question,&quot; he said, &quot;is how far can youreduce it, and what policy does the department use to gain control over it?&quot;;   So far, no one in San Jose has come up with a good solution.;    But 13overtime-cutting recommendations by Chief Joseph McNamara are being analyzedby city staff members to determine their effectiveness and practicality. Amongthe proposals are:;    (check) Reducing the number of officers on burglary,truancy, narcotic and street crime units. McNamara warned council members thatthis could result in more crime.;    (check) Not responding to everynon-injury auto accident, or property crime when there is no suspect.;   (check) Reducing traffic and crowd control for special events such as thecounty fair, Cinco de Mayo and the Veterans Day Parade.;    Bob Brownstein,budget director for Mayor Susan Hammer, said the analysis may justify boostingthe overtime budget, or show that stronger management actions are needed.Nonetheless, Brownstein said, Hammer is &quot;very determined&quot; to see thedepartment stick to its overtime budget &quot;short of some extraordinarycircumstance.&quot;;    Some officials say the addition of 35 to 40 officers lastmonth plus another 23 later this year will curb overtime. Others aren't sosure.;    New officers mean more arrests and more investigations that willgenerate overtime, said Sgt. Michael Fehr, head of the San Jose policeofficers' union.;    Said consultant Dart: &quot;I've never found that increasingpeople reduced overtime unless the department was seriously undermanned.&quot;;   Finding a lasting solution to controlling overtime is one thing, but whittlingdown the current mountain of overtime is another.;    Clearly, buying out thecomp time is an expensive alternative that the city -- which is grappling witha projected drop in revenue -- may not be able to consider. Comp time is paidoff at 1 1/2 times the hourly rate, but it is also paid based on the officer'scurrent salary.;    The other alternative is ordering officers to take theircomp time off, a course of action that the department has instituted, Abramsaid. Some bureaus within the department already have been directed to reducetheir comp time by certain percentages.;    But this strategy has itsdrawbacks. During fiscal 1987-'88, officers took so much comp time that theauditors determined the city lost the equivalent of 100 officers, or about 10percent of the force.;    In the long run, taking comp time creates moreovertime, Dart said. The department is forced to replace the cop who's takingcomp time with another officer who is likely to be accumulating overtime as aresult.;    Taking comp time off can be nearly impossible for some officers.&quot;You just can't take off,&quot; undercover officer Peter Lovecchio said. &quot;Sometimesyou're right in the middle of a proactive investigation.&quot;;    Even whenofficers can get away from the department, they may find it conflicts withtheir schedule of court appearances. Court visits mean automatic overtime forofficers who work nights or have weekdays off.;    Despite the potential forpiling up hours of unpaid time, Fehr said he has never heard of any officercomplaining about working overtime.;    In accumulating his 758 hours of comptime -- eighth-highest in the department -- Lovecchio has had to put offtrips, work most holidays and fight colds while chasing bookies, prostitutesand dope dealers. When he did take a rare holiday off last year, he spent itsleeping.;    Escobar took into account the traditional long hours thathomicide detectives put in before taking the job: &quot;I waited for my kids togrow up and get out of the house before taking this assignment.&quot;;     Top 10in overtime; These 10 San Jose police officers have the most accumulated comptime. The hours are the time each officer is entitled to take off, with pay,for working overtime.;   Employee                    Duties                  Hours; Sgt.
