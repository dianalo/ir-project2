The odors were coming from the vicinity of the women'srestroom in building 900A. Air samples were collected for some toxicgases and vapors. Carbon dioxide increased from 415 parts per millionin the morning to 1000 parts per million in the afternoon, indicatingthat there was very little fresh air being introduced into the buildingthrough the air-handling system. Two soil samples from underneath thebuilding were also taken and revealed a cycloocta form of elemental sulfur,extremely low levels of aliphatic hydrocarbons, and a few phthalate esters.The author concludes that soluble forms of sulfur may have leached outof the soil during rainy or wet periods and oxidized to produce an odor.The author recommends that water should be redirected away from building900A, that all foundation vents to this building be open for cross ventilationand that all leaking plumbing fixtures be fixed. Better ventilation shouldbe provided by installing an air-handling system at one end of the affectedbuilding to supply fresh air and an exhaust system at the other end ofthe building to assist air flow.</TEXT></DOC>
