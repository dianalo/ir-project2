Robins Co.'s Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law case strongly indicated he will approve the company's reorganization plan.    At a hearing here yesterday, Judge Robert Merhige Jr. said the only remaining detail to be worked out is the wording in a court order on how much supervision the court will give to a $2.38 billion trust fund being established for Dalkon Shield victims.    &quot;I have have no reason to think the court won't confirm this plan,&quot; Judge Merhige said.    Earlier at the same hearing, the health-products maker's lawyers told the judge that creditors of Robins, including the Dalkon Shield injury claimants, voted overwhelmingly in favor of the plan. Robins sold the Shield, an intrauterine contraceptive, in the early 1970s.    The claimants' endorsement -- far more than the required two-thirds majority -- was crucial to court approval of the plan, under which New York-based American Home Products Corp. will acquire Robins and provide most of the trust fund.    If the court approves the reorganization, a dissident group of claimants' lawyers said they are likely to appeal. These lawyers, who said they represent at least 4,000 women, contend that many claimants might not receive adequate compensation for their injuries under the proposed plan. Such an appeal could delay completion of the American Home acquisition for at least several months.    Robins's lawyers told the judge that the plan is favored by 94% of the 139,605 Shield claimants who voted properly. Robins's commercial creditors and shareholders voted almost unanimously to approve the reorganization.    Robins sought court protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code in August 1985 to freeze thousands of lawsuits brought by women claiming injury from the Shield. </TEXT></DOC>
