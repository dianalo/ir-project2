Consequently, the hypothesis was forwardedthat aluminum binding to calmodulin may be a key lesion in what is nowthe broadly defined syndrome of aluminum toxicity. In the following theysummarize results on Al-related structural changes in calmodulin andpresent new data on dynamic changes of the protein in the presence ofaluminum ions.</TEXT></DOC>
