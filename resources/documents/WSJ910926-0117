A new nationwide Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll showsthat voters, by a margin of better than 3 to 1, side with Mr.Bush in his efforts to face down congressional and Israelipressure to take up the issue of granting Israel $10 billionin loan guarantees to help it house the influx of SovietJews.</LP><TEXT>   Moreover, the loan-guarantee issue may be contributing toa backlash against Israel by U.S. voters. In the poll, whichwas conducted for the Journal and NBC by Democratic pollsterPeter Hart and Republican pollster Robert Teeter, only 44% ofvoters feel the U.S. should provide any economic aid toIsrael, while 46% oppose such aid.   Considering the historical bonds between the two nations,that is a stunning finding: By contrast, voters by 58% to 32%favor economic aid to the Soviet Union, until recentlyAmerica's foremost adversary in the world, and by 55% to 29%they favor such aid to Poland.   Mr. Bush says he wants to delay consideration of theIsraeli loan guarantees for at least 120 days, because adebate over the issue now could undermine the U.S.-backedMiddle East peace talks he hopes will begin next month. Andalthough Israeli leaders have vowed to press ahead with therequest, congressional leaders -- who read the polls asclosely as the White House does -- are now indicating thepresident will prevail.   In addition, many Democrats worry that Mr. Bush has putthem on the defensive on the very issue they had hoped todominate this fall: The contention that he is preoccupiedwith foreign affairs, while they are the ones concerned withdomestic matters. In this dispute, Democrats fear, it is Mr.Bush who is persuading voters that he is in tune with theircurrent &quot;charity begins at home&quot; mood, while they are seen asthe party defending the unpopular notion of foreign aid.   &quot;President Bush has done an awful good job at portrayingthis, and has convinced people -- and unjustly so in my view-- that this is a Democratic proposal,&quot; says former FloridaDemocratic Chairman Charles Whitehead. &quot;It's been a verywell-orchestrated manuever by Bush's people to put that shoeon the Democrats' foot.&quot;   With the recession still pinching the wallets ofgovernments and individuals alike, Mr. Whitehead adds, &quot;thetiming is horrible&quot; from his party's standpoint to take upthe Israeli issue. This week, for example, Floridians arereeling from a proposal to cut state funding for allextracurricular school activities statewide as part of aneffort to close the state's budget deficit. &quot;When you dosomething like that, and you talk about giving some othercountry $10 billion, it's not going to fly,&quot; he says.   The Journal/NBC poll bears out the contention that foreignaid -- never popular with the voters except in rare cases --is an especially tough sell right now. Asked whether theyfavor or oppose reducing the aid the U.S. gives to foreigncountries, 69% say they want to reduce such aid, while only24% oppose reducing it.   To be sure, President Bush also faces political risks inthe current confrontation with Israel. For one thing,analysts say the peace conference is a complicated enterpriseunder the best of conditions, and by hyping theloan-guarantee issue, Mr. Bush may be building up hopes thathe won't be able to fulfill in short order.   &quot;There's a big risk by definition in convening a peaceconference, in getting expectations up, because {a MiddleEast peace accord} will take years,&quot; says Charles Black, aRepublican political strategist.   On a more practical political note, Mr. Bush's toughstance could also create problems for some fellowRepublicans, particularly in terms of raising funds among theU.S. Jewish community.   But what the president has going for him, Mr. Blackobserves, is the leeway granted by a seemingly rock-solidpublic confidence in his handling of foreign affairs. Indeed,in another pressing foreign policy crisis -- the disputebetween Iraq's Saddam Hussein and the West over UnitedNations inspections of Iraqi military installations -- votersby a margin of 74% to 17% agree with Mr. Bush's stancethreatening military action.   Further strengthening his hand in the Israeli loan disputeis U.S. voters' clear discontent with Israel. The Journal/NBCpoll found that 34% regard Israel as the biggest impedimentto a Mideast peace settlement, while 33% believe the Arabnations are the chief stumbling block. And by 49% to 31%,they believe Israel should give up occupied Arab lands in theWest Bank, Gaza Strip and Golan Heights in return for a peaceaccord.   Yet some observers think that now that Mr. Bush has madehis point on the guarantees to Israel's leaders -- and tocongressional Democrats -- he doesn't want the tensions tocontinue to escalate. &quot;The public's with him,&quot; says GOPtheoretician Kevin Phillips, but he adds, &quot;I just don't thinkhe's going to want to capitalize on a real fight&quot; because ofthe potential for the situation to get out of hand.   Mr. Bush already has moved to lower the temperature. Lastweek he sent a letter to the Conference of Presidents ofMajor Jewish Organizations apologizing for comments he madeat a news conference asserting that &quot;powerful politicalforces&quot; were pushing the loan guarantees to the detriment ofthe peace process. Mr. Bush said he was concerned if hiscomments &quot;caused apprehension&quot; in the Jewish community. Andthe president also used his annual address to the U.N. thisweek for a strongly worded request that the organizationrepeal its 1975 resolution equating Zionism with racism.   Meanwhile, many Democrats argue that whatever politicaldamage they have suffered on the guarantee issue willdissipate, allowing them to reclaim the charge that Mr. Bushis more concerned with what happens beyond America's bordersthan within them.   &quot;Citizens are going to recognize it's been Democratschampioning the issues like extended unemployment benefits,&quot;says Gary Corbin, chairman of the Michigan Democratic Party.&quot;They're going to look at the incongruity of the president'sposition and realize that the administration has not stood upfor working America at all.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
