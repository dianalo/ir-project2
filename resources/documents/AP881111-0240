No more. In her new album, ``Doodle Lee Do'in,'' Reilly followsthe course of motherhood, from a woman's yearning for a child to herpregnancy to the joys and frustrations of being a parent.   In a crystal-clear soprano, she sings a lullaby to the fetuslocked inside her womb, imploring the child not to be afraid to beborn:   ``There'll be stars above   ``And warm soft woolen gloves   ``And someone new to love   ``When you come out and play.''   She criticizes an infant's manners: ``I feed you all the nightand day, You throw it back right into my face.'' But years later shemisses the travails of caring for a baby: ``There's nobody playingwith the knobs and dials, nobody giving me a toothless smile....''   Reilly has always found her inspiration in her own life. In her20s and early 30s, she says, ``I wrote a lot about sad love affairs.I kind of ran out of ideas there, so I got married.''   Then came her children _ Emily, 7, and Charlie, 5 _ theinspiration for ``Doodle Lee Do'in.'' The album cover shows apregnant, seated Reilly with a Coke cup balanced on her distendedbelly.   Although there is a sweet sunniness to the album, Reilly does notsuggest that motherhood has been as easy as apple pie.   ``In reality, motherhood has been a real challenge to me. It'sbeen hard,'' says the 42-year-old, Seattle-based singer.   Between making beds, vacuuming the floors and picking up thekids, her energy and creativity flagged. She had no time to writemusic; the song ``Emily'' was composed entirely in her head, becauseshe ``just didn't have a second'' to sit down with a guitar.   Nor did she sing to her babies. ``Charlie actually would begin tocry when I sang to him,'' she said.   Charlie may be adorable _ like his mother and sister, he has acrop of orange hair _ but his taste in music is questionable. Hismother has been singing professionally since 1968, and has sung withDavid Maloney since 1970.   The duo, billed as Reilly andamp; Maloney, has put out seven albums ontheir own Freckle Records label, which is run by Reilly's husband,Jack Burg. Though they have toured widely, they're most popular onthe West Coast.   Reilly has made one other solo album, but had never considered acollection of the motherhood songs she had written over the years.On tour, she would sing one or two of the songs at each show.   ``The nightclub people aren't too excited to hear all your babysongs back to back,'' she says.   Then, three years ago, she was asked to sing at a regionalconvention of the International Childbirth Education Association.She put together a program of appropriate songs, and they were wellreceived. Afterwards, members of the audience lined up to buy tapesof her performance.   ``First, I freaked out because they weren't supposed to beselling my music. Then I thought, `Maybe there's some interest inthis,''' she said.   It took a while to put the album together. Emily and Charlielistened as she practiced songs about them, and they kept a closetally of how many songs were about each child.   Her album complete, Reilly thinks she knows why women haveproduced few songs about pregnancy and motherhood: ``They've beentoo busy doing it.''   Even given the time, she says, such songs may not draw anyattention. ``The only real women's music you see these days is bylesbians. I sometimes say I'm going to do an album called `Songs forNeurotic, Heterosexual Women.' You have to be different and weird toget any attention nowadays.''   She will sing some of the songs when she and Maloney tour, asthey do about 100 days a year. Touring is tough, but not necessarilybecause she is separated from her children.   ``The hard thing is to make the switch between working and beinga housewife,'' she said. ``I get back into staying up late at nightto work, sleeping late in the morning, talking to adults all day,reading _ that old life I used to live when I was younger.   ``I get back here and WHAM, I walk into the house and there'sthis whole other universe. It takes days to get used to it. I'vebeen back seven days now and I just today got around to vacuumingthe house.''</TEXT><TEXT>   ``Doodle Lee Do'in'' is available from Freckle Records, P.O.
