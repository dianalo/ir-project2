About 2,000 police with clubs and shields formed human walls tokeep the protesters, brandishing flag poles and sticks, from therally outside the presidential office building. Police also usedwater cannons and barbed-wire barricades.   Seven people were reported injured, including five policemen.   After the street battle, about 10,000 demonstrators massedoutside a jail to demand the immediate release of dissidentpublisher Hsu Hsin-Liang.   The 90-minute parade of military honor guards and marching anddancing students was not interrupted. An estimated 250,000spectators filled the square in front of the office building.   President Lee Teng-hui delivered a brief address to the rally,attended by dignitaries of 40 countries.   ``Taiwan's future cannot be viewed as independent of a reunifiedChina,'' he said. ``Our sense of national righteousness andsincerity will most certainly not allow us to merely stand by andwatch China continue to exist with one part living in a state offreedom and the other under enslavement.''   The Nationalists, who fled the Chinese mainland when thecommunists won the civil war in 1949, have suffered diplomaticsetbacks because of their claim to be the sole legitimategovernment of China.   Chen Wan-chen, a protest organizer, said the demonstrators fromthe opposition Democratic Progressive Party wanted to appeal to Leeto release three prominent political prisoners, including Hsu.   About 10,000 riot police blocked all three intersections leadingto the jail where the 48-year-old publisher is held.   Protesters wore yellow headbands, carried yellow flowers andwaved banners reading ``Release Hsu Hsin-liang.''   Hsu Hsin-liang was arrested after his return from the UnitedStates last month, pending sedition charges. The other two wereconvicted of sedition and sentenced in 1987 to long jail terms.   All are accused of advocating that Taiwan no longer consideritself part of China.   National Day marks the 1911 uprising in Wuhan, central China,that led to the fall of the Manchu Ching dynasty.</TEXT></DOC>
