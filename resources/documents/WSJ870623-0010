Their testimony came as the panel, a subcommittee of the Finance Committee, produced a memo from a field branch chief suggesting he would decide whether to promote his employees based on the number of seizures they had made and the amount of funds they had collected. Such evaluations are contrary to written IRS policy.    Yesterday's hearing was the latest in a series the panel has held on proposed legislation to establish what members call a taxpayers' bill of rights. Among other things, the legislation would shift the burden of proof to the IRS from the taxpayer in most court proceedings and limit the ability of the IRS to seize property. It also would bar the agency from promoting employees based on their collection records.    Sen. David Pryor (D., Ark.) chairman of the subcommittee and a chief sponsor of the measure, said that some lawmakers declined to help sponsor the bill out of fear that they would be audited. He said the measure does have 28 Senate co-sponsors and 70 House sponsors.    IRS Commissioner Lawrence Gibbs has expressed opposition to the legislation, contending that its goals of improved taxpayer-IRS relations could be better achieved through IRS actions.    The employees at yesterday's hearing said the pressure to seize property and boost collections has persisted despite a stated new emphasis by top IRS officials on quality rather than numbers. &quot;Now, if you don't make a seizure, it's a quality error,&quot; said Robert Miller, a 14-year IRS veteran.    Shirley Garcia, who has spent 16 years with the agency, said employees sometimes push to get more seizures to avoid getting their manager in trouble. IRS offices compare statistics on a day-to-day basis, she said, and managers often fear they won't get merit pay increases if collections fall.    The third employee, 26-year veteran Robert Brown, who said he plans to retire soon, said his performance evaluation as an instructor suffered after he urged employees to be courteous to taxpayers.    The memo from the field branch chief in the Baltimore area was dated Feb. 17, 1987, and dealt with the January performance of the managers under him. He wrote that &quot;it is a sorry report,&quot; and complained about low numbers of referrals to criminal investigation and seizures, among other things.    &quot;Your midyear evaluations will be prepared in approximately one and one-half months,&quot; the memo warned. &quot;You will be evaluated on your accomplishments or lack of accomplishments. Need I say more?&quot;    An IRS spokeswoman yesterday emphasized that IRS policy forbids the use of enforcement statistics to evaluate performance and that the manager apparently misunderstood the guidelines. &quot;He probably shouldn't have said what he said,&quot; she said.    At the hearing, the subcommittee also heard testimony from two taxpayers who contended that the IRS acted unreasonably in collecting delinquent taxes from them.    One of them, a restaurant owner in Tontitown, Ark., said he was forced into a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing after the IRS refused to accept payment by installment of the taxes he owed. Under Chapter 11, a company is given court protection from creditors' suits while it seeks to work out a plan for paying its debts. </TEXT></DOC>
