Asda said thesharp reversal was the result of a #78.9 million exceptionalcharge meant to reflect restructuring costs and propertylosses.   But ignoring the exceptional charge, Asda's figures werewithin the range of prior estimates by stock-market analysts,some of whom had warned of the possibility of a largewrite-down.   Asda cut the interim dividend 32% to 1.25 pence a sharefrom 1.85 pence. The move was expected. Asda repeated itwould pay a final dividend of 0.85 pence, making for afull-year dividend of 2.10 pence a share.
