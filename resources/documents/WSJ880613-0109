Birnbaum (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><DATELINE> MACKINAC ISLAND, Mich.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Democratic strategists, hoping to contain their differences, began drafting a platform designed to counter Republican charges that the party is soft on defense and eager to raise taxes.    But party leaders' hopes of writing a broadly worded document began to evaporate, as early versions of platform planks were cluttered with specific promises.    Overall, however, the tone of the three-day meeting was as placid as the swaying lilacs in this breezy tourist haven. Representatives of the Rev. Jesse Jackson took every opportunity to emphasize their intention to unite behind likely presidential candidate Michael Dukakis.    For those who expected blood on the floor, said Eleanor Holmes Norton, who heads Mr. Jackson's delegation here, &quot;you will find the floor is clean.&quot;    &quot;Jesse Jackson's role is as a leader in the Democratic Party,&quot; said Jackson adviser Ann Lewis. &quot;We didn't come here to find reasons to disagree.&quot; But, she added, &quot;cooperation does not mean unanimity,&quot; and what battle lines do exist were clearly drawn. The Jackson forces constantly prodded the Dukakis camp to drop fuzzy language in favor of more pointed positions.    The chief dispute is over taxes. &quot;A tax increase is not going to be in the platform,&quot; said Mr. Dukakis's chief negotiator, Michael Barnes. Instead, the Massachusetts governor argues that significant revenue can be raised by bolstering collection of unpaid taxes, and pledges that an increase would be only the &quot;last resort.&quot; A draft of the economic plank calls vaguely for &quot;a strong commitment to fiscal responsibility,&quot; and doesn't mention the word &quot;tax.&quot;    Mr. Jackson's representatives said that wasn't good enough. Despite reminders from Dukakis partisans that a call for a tax increase in 1984 crippled Walter Mondale's candidacy, Jackson backers pressed for support of an increase on wealthy individuals and corporations. They asserted that the Democratic candidate should have a &quot;responsible&quot; budget plan and seek a specific mandate from the voters.    Another dispute is over military spending. Mr. Jackson's representatives pushed for a five-year &quot;freeze&quot; of the Pentagon budget at current levels. But Mr. Dukakis's people declined to be pinned down, and called instead for &quot;stable&quot; spending. As a fallback position, Mr. Jackson's camp discussed a pledge to divert some funds from projected military spending to nonmilitary uses.    The third major disagreement involved nuclear weapons. The Jackson delegation sought a plank that would prohibit the U.S. from using nuclear weapons first. But the Dukakis side rejected the stand as strategically unwise.    Other than these issues, most of the debate was amicable. For example, each delegation gave the other an important victory in foreign policy. The Dukakis camp accepted Mr. Jackson's demand that South Africa be declared a terrorist state because of its apartheid policies. For their part, the Jackson members omitted any mention of creating a homeland for the Palestinians, a position Mr. Dukakis doesn't endorse.    Party staff members presented preliminary drafts of some of the least contentious planks, including those dealing with drugs, education, civil rights, housing, health care, energy, the environment, agriculture and the economy. Each contains more specific proposals than did the thematic document with which the talks began.    The drafts call for a &quot;national drug czar&quot; and a &quot;national teacher corps,&quot; that would recruit teachers by offering scholarships. The planks advocate pay equity for women, development of clean-coal technology, and supply-management policies as part of farm programs. They support adoption of the Equal Rights Amendment and giving assistance to first-time homebuyers.    The meeting got off to a rocky start, as participants feared that the Jackson delegates lacked authority from him to bargain. The Jackson negotiators became more confident as the meeting progressed. Still, leaders focused on the least controversial provisions, leaving the Jackson delegation to raise its concerns again at the bigger platform committee meeting later this month or at the convention itself in July.    &quot;I hope this spirit of collegiality continues,&quot; said Rep. William Gray of Pennsylvania, the drafting committee chairman. &quot;But this is just the first step.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
