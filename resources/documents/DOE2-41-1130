Long,medium and short term scheduling is essential for economic and secureoperation. The principles for the utilization of different availableresources in a complex production system, including conventional, nuclearand hydroelectric power generation, are described, with particular referenceto their economical benefits. The amount of information necessary tocontrol the behaviour of power generation, transmission and distributionmakes the use of an integrated computer system mandatory.</TEXT></DOC>
