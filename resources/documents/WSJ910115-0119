As one would expect from such thoughtful andexperienced observers, much of what they have to say makesgood sense. Yet it is also possible to have misgivings aboutcertain aspects of their thesis, if for no other reason thanits ambiguity and lack of supporting analysis.   It would appear that their initial point of departurewould involve the capturing of Kuwaiti air space, forcing theIraqis to withdraw or suffer the consequences of devastatingattack of their positions in Kuwait. This in turn might befollowed up with ground attacks if required to dislodge Iraqiforces in Kuwait. So far as we are aware, such an approachcommends itself to most observers. What is apparentlydifferent in the Wohlstetter/Hoffman approach is that theywould forswear what they refer to as &quot;strategic&quot; bombing,which is not further defined except by reference to certainactions that they would not recommend. It is here that someambiguity seems to us to creep in.</LP><TEXT>   Such bombing, they say, would by being &quot;aimed atdestroying {Saddam's} military power&quot; divert resources fromgetting him out of Kuwait. We interpret this to mean that themain focus, perhaps the entire focus, should be on destroyingIraq's forces in Kuwait proper (including attacks on theirresupply), eschewing attacks on Iraq's military capabilitymore remotely situated. The latter, Messers. Wohlstetter andHoffman correctly point out, would require deeper air strikes(with attendant great risks from Iraqi air defenses). Also,we are told that such &quot;strategic&quot; bombing would involveattacks on the Iraqi national command that would be futile(noting that even Castro has 28 places to hide; presumablySaddam even more). It would also, we are told, be futile inthis &quot;strategic&quot; bombing to go after Iraq's &quot;small lumps ofhighly enriched uranium,&quot; which our bombers would be unlikelyto find, and it would be perhaps even counterproductive toattack Iraq's biological-warfare production facilities sincethis would threaten the release of a cloud that might reachIran or Turkey. These several propositions require carefulexamination.   Whether &quot;strategic&quot; bombing &quot;aimed at destroying&quot; Iraqimilitary power would divert resources from attacks on Kuwaitis not all that clear. It obviously depends on severalvariables: (1) how many militarily attractive targets thereare for our bombers to attack in Kuwait, (2) how large aforce we have to apply to that task, (3) whether there mightbe capacity to saturate this target set while attacking otheraspects of Iraqi military power, (4) what those other aspectsare and how significantly their destruction might affectIraqi ability to conduct military operations in Kuwait orelsewhere and (5) what might be the collateral effects ofsuch attacks? These are not easy questions to answer, butsome of the answers offered by Messrs. Wohlstetter andHoffman do not fully satisfy.   For example, attacks on the Iraq national command (in theperson of Saddam Hussein) might or might not be usefullyundertaken. In part this is a question of the adequacy ofU.S. intelligence. We wonder, however, whether the solecriterion in this regard is the ability of U.S. air power totarget Saddam personally, however nice that would be. Arethere other aspects of the Iraqi national command that couldusefully be attacked with the result of reducing Iraqiability to pursue its military aims? And the allusion to thefutility of destroying &quot;Saddam's small lumps of highlyenriched uranium&quot; strike us as a misdirected red herring.Would it not be useful to destroy the Iraqi reactor, as theIsraelis did at an earlier point in time, so that futureproduction would be inhibited? In the same vein, attackingIraqi biological-warfare production seems to us to warrantcareful consideration. First of all, whether such an attackwould release a cloud threatening other states, including ourally Turkey, is a serious issue. It is, however, nowhereclear from Messrs. Wohlstetter and Hoffman how serious alikelihood this is. The authors present no analysis tosupport this notion, though knowing them both to be carefulstudents they have doubtless done the requisite analysis.Perhaps they would be willing to share it with us. Otherwiseone is inclined to suspect that this is a secondhandallegation not adequately supported by analysis. Moreover,would Messrs. Wohlstetter and Hoffman permit U.S. and alliedtroops to be subject to biological-weapons attack while theproduction facility that supplies the wherewithal for thoseattacks remains a sanctuary? Indeed, the issue ofsanctuaries, while never explicitly mentioned in theirarticle, seems implicit. For our own part we would beexplicit: Intentional attacks on civilian targets unrelatedto support of Iraq's military effort should be ruled out.(This is apparently what Messrs. Wohlstetter and Hoffman hadin mind in referring to the discredited &quot;scenario for MutualAssured Destruction.&quot;) But attacking military targets,including those inside Iraq, such as their biological-weaponsproduction capability and their chemical-weapons capability,their major supply and ammo depots, and critical command andcontrol modes, should not automatically be ruled out andplaced in sanctuary. Nor would it appear logical to concludeany air campaign against Iraq without destroying itslong-range-missile production facilities, since the missilesproduced threaten vital targets in neighboring states.   Such attacks should be considered on a case-by-case basis,taking into account the probable military benefit ofdestroying such military facilities against the probablecollateral destruction likely to be imposed. We surely do notwish to return to the Vietnam approach of a blanketconstraint on our military forces for striking importantmilitary targets, even those close to civilian facilities.   Messrs. Wohlstetter and Hoffman quite rightly suggest thatwe should be clear as to our objectives in employing militaryforce. They would seem to imply that our sole militaryobjective should be to drive Iraqi military forces fromKuwait and indeed share a concern that we should not wish todestroy Iraqi military power completely (&quot;even if that couldbe done&quot;) for to do so would leave a vacuum into which Syriaor Iran might move. The point is partially well taken. Forour part, destroying Saddam's military power as completely aswe are capable of doing would seem worthwhile. Leaving him,or his henchmen, to stay in power and over time rebuildIraq's military power (who can say with certainty this couldnot be accomplished?) is not sensible. Nor are we impressedwith the notion of applying just enough military force tobeat them back from Kuwait while protecting their remainingmilitary capabilities as a check against other powers in thearea. This strikes us as using military force, a bluntinstrument at best, in an attempt to cut the politicalobjective much too fine. Maintaining Iraq as a balanceagainst Syria and Iran is a sensible objective. It may bepossible to replace Saddam and his henchmen with Iraqis lessdevoted to aggression who might, as a consequence, serve as abalance in the Gulf region. We readily admit that this willnot be easy to accomplish. However, who would have believedthat the fanatical Japanese of World War II could accept,indeed embrace, a democratic, pacifist government?   The issue does, however, begin to get at the matter ofwhat our ultimate objectives ought to be in the event ofhostilities. It seems to us it is quite one matter to offerIraq the chance to pull out of Kuwait, unconditionally, if itdoes so peacefully, and quite another to fight a war, shedblood, while retaining as an objective protecting Iraq andits regime from military devastation. In fact, it isprecisely such a choice that Saddam should have to face.   Seymour Weiss   Gen. John Vogt   Adm.
