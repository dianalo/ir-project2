David Jones, who served as jointchiefs chairman in the early 1980s, told the Senate Armed ServicesCommittee on Friday.   Asked whether one part of the strategic deterrent could bedropped, the former chairmen agreed on drastically scaling backplans to build more multiple-warhead, rail-based MX missiles and todeploy the new, single-warhead Midgetman.   ``I would cancel the two land-based missiles,'' said retiredGen. John Vessey, who was joint chiefs chairman in the mid-1980s.``I think the idea that someone's going to attack our silo-basedmissile forces, ... it's just not reasonable now.''   Retired Adm. William Crowe, who stepped down last October aschairman of the joint chiefs, agreed with Vessey, and noted theUnited States has ``a mobile missile in the field _ the seabornemobile missile'' on submarines.   The comments by the former military leaders prompted thecommittee's chairman, Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., to say that unless theadministration pushes for a ban on multiple-warhead missiles in astrategic arms control pact, he would not support the MX andMidgetman.   ``I sold a lot of people on that _ people on both sides of thisissue _ that I thought a ban on mobile (multiple warheads) wasgoing to be forthcoming from the White House ..., '' Nunn said.``There is no way that I can support two missiles this year withthe current arms control position that we have.''   The United States and Soviet Union are working on a treaty thatwould cut their long-range nuclear arsenals by 30 percent to 50percent, to 6,000 warheads apiece.   However, the two sides disagree over how to count air-launchedcruise missiles, how to handle undeployed missiles and U.S.allegations that the Soviets have encoded data transmissions fromballistic missile tests in violation of arms accords.   Secretary of State James A. Baker III is expected to discuss theissues with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze when thetwo meet next week in Moscow.   The administration's new budget released Monday proposesspending $2.8 billion to fund rail-basing of the MX and $202million for the truck-based Midgetman.   Fifty MX missiles are already in silos, along with the olderMinuteman long-range missile force, and the administration wants toput 50 more MXs on rail cars to make them less vulnerable to attack.   Vessey emphasized any action on the MX and Midgetman should bedone along with a strategic arms control agreement with the SovietUnion.   ``I would not do this without forcing them to give up theirmobile (warheads),'' he said.   Jones suggested some money should be left in the missileprograms for research and development.   Nunn expressed dismay over the failure of the administration tospell out its strategy and arms control agenda, especially in lightof the collapse of communist regimes in Eastern Europe.   ``We're going to have an arms control position that's out ofsync with our strategic planning and our posture and it's just atragedy we can't get together on this,'' Nunn said. ``It's got tostart with some vision coming out of the White House and theDepartment of Defense.''</TEXT></DOC>
