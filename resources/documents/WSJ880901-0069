The announcement raised to $10.2 billion the financial commitments made by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. for thrift mergers in just the past two weeks. The Bank Board said it will hold the 14 Oklahoma thrifts and immediately begin trying to market the institutions to potential acquirers.    Danny Wall, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the FSLIC's parent, conceded that he is doing as many assisted mergers as he can before Sept. 30 for budgetary reasons. After that date, he explained, the federal budget will chalk up FSLIC-issued notes as expenditures when they are issued, rather than when interest and principal are paid out, as is currently the case.    The accelerated merger program also circumvents potential problems with the deficit ceilings prescribed by the Gramm-Rudman budget law. If it continued issuing notes at the current pace, the FSLIC could trigger across-the-board spending cuts for the new fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. But commitments made before the end of September won't be counted in spending for next fiscal year.    The spate of debt also comes as Congress is about to resume consideration of an $11 billion limit on FSLIC notes, a cap already approved by the Senate. The agency already has issued $10.2 billion in notes, and Mr. Wall said it may exceed $11 billion by the end of September.    Another major FSLIC commitment could come soon. Expiring today is the agency's agreement to negotiate solely with Robert M. Bass Group Inc. of Fort Worth, Texas, on the acquisition of the American Savings unit of Financial Corp. of America, Irvine, Calif. As negotiations continued, Bank Board officials said they planned an announcement for today, but refused to say whether an agreement is expected. The Bank Board twice before had agreed to extend the negotiating period.    Stuart Root, the director of the FSLIC, said the Oklahoma mergers and planned trimming of the thrifts' branch networks would make the sick Sandamp;Ls &quot;more marketable.&quot; But he conceded that the FSLIC had already tried unsuccessfully to market some of them.    It marks the second time this year that the FSLIC has merged and held institutions that it had failed to sell. On Aug. 19, it issued commitments valued at an estimated $5.5 billion to prop up eight merged Texas institutions led by Sunbelt Savings Association, Dallas, without finding a buyer.    Aside from their restructuring and budgetary advantages, these assisted mergers have a distinct tax benefit. FSLIC assistance will lose its tax-free status Jan. 1, unless Congress acts soon to extend it. But the FSLIC's commitments to conglomerations of sick thrifts in 1988 can be picked up tax-free by acquirers after the end of the year.    Consultant Dan Brumbaugh, a former Bank Board economist, said that such merging and restructuring of thrifts under FSLIC ownership could make them more attractive to investors. But he quarreled with the FSLIC's listing them as &quot;resolved&quot; insolvent thrift cases. This conclusion is only merited when an acquirer takes them over, he said.    The thrifts involved in the Oklahoma mergers have aggregate assets of $3.63 billion and operating losses of more than $100 million annually, the Bank Board said. The largest are Frontier Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, Ponca City, with $1 billion in assets; MidAmerica Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, Tulsa, with $488.7 million in assets; and Phoenix Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, Muskogee, with assets of $437.2 million. </TEXT></DOC>
