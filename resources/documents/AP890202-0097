(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Punxsutawney Phil, that plump, pamperedgroundhog long touted as America's best mammalian meteorologicalprognosticator, saw his shadow today, predicting six more weeks of a``kinder and gentler'' winter.   Phil's promoters, declaring today the 102nd Groundhog Day,rousted the brown, bewhiskered forecaster out of his lighted, heatedburrow at dawn.   ``In honor of America's new president, George Bush, the groundhogstood tall and proud. He spotted a thin, short shadow,''Punxsutawney Groundhog Club President James H. Means told spectatorsgathered at Gobbler's Knob, a wooded knoll about three miles southof Punxsutawney.   ``The king of all groundhogs is returning to his burrow with apromise of a kinder and gentler winter,'' Means said.   Tradition has it if the weather-wise woodchuck sees his shadow,six more weeks of winter will follow. But if he doesn't, they sayspring is just around the corner.   Phil's unscientific forecasts don't always hold up, but hishandlers nevertheless claim he's never wrong.   ``We say he's always right,'' said William Null, secretary of thegroundhog club and executive director of the local Chamber ofCommerce. ``There are some people who contest that, usuallyweathermen, but we stand behind Phil 100 percent.''   Groundhog Day fun has given rise to four-legged forecasterselsewhere, and most of them today broke with Phil and predicted anearly spring despite the arctic blast that's been working its wayacross the country in the past couple of days. But none draws theattention that Phil does.   ``Phil's been at it longer than any of the others,'' Null said.``He's treated like a real king.''   Some folks in Newport, R.I., made up ``Quahog Day'' and cast aman dressed as a quahog, a type of clam, to come out of his shelltoday. The quahog did not see his shadow, so Rhode Island istheoretically assured of a short winter.   Georgia's also off the hook, winter-wise, as a groundhog dubbedGeneral Lee failed to see a shadow today in Lilburn, Ga.   West Virginia's Concord Charlie and French Creek Freddy bothfailed to see their shadows this morning, as did Buckeye Chuck inMarion, Ohio, and Rowdy, a groundhog at the Indianapolis Zoo.And itwas likewise in Sun Prairie, Wis., where Jimmy the Groundhog bravedwind-chills of 16 below to predict an early spring there.   But it is this western Pennsylvania mountain town of about 8,000people that bills itself as the ``Weather Capital of the World,''crowns a Groundhog Queen and King, stages a Groundhog Ball, andattracts tour-bus visitors who often buy souvenirs glorifying theexalted woodchuck.   Every year, hundreds of people follow a century-old tradition andtrudge up to Phil's one-morning-a-year home atop Gobbler's Knob.   Fourteen businessmen of the club's exclusive ``Inner Circle'' dontop hats and tuxedos to carry on the tradition. Actually, InnerCircle members decide on the groundhog's prediction beforehand.   Several hours before sunrise, Phil is taken from his year-roundhome in a glass-enclosed case next to the town library and shovedinto the man-made burrow to await spectators.   The woodchuck, whose species usually hibernates until March, isthen hoisted at dawn to the glare of television floodlights andpopping flashbulbs.   Perhaps cleverly, Phil has predicted an early spring only ninetimes _ in 1890, 1902, 1934, 1950, 1970, 1975, 1983, 1986 and 1988,according to Null.   Groundhog Day legend is based on an old Scottish coupletclaiming, ``If Candlemas Day is bright and clear, there will be twowinters in the year.'' Feb. 2 is the Christian holiday of Candlemas.   In the late 1800s, the feast appealed to Punxsutawney'sGerman-born farmers, who hunted woodchucks for food.   For the record, the National Weather Service's 30-day outlookcalls for above normal temperatures and below normal precipitationin the Southeast, below normal temperatures and precipitation overthe Northwest, near normal temperatures and precipitation in theNortheast, and near normal temperatures and above normaltemperatures over the nation's central area.</TEXT></DOC>
