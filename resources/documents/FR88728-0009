This rulesets forth the requirements these entities must meet to receive paymentdirectly from Medicare.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>August 29, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Ed Roth, 301-966-4486.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>Under Medicare's Supplementary Medical Insurance program (Part B), thepayment for the services of a physician or supplier is generally 80 percentof reasonable charges in excess of an annual deductible amount. Upon submissionof a properly executed claim, this payment is made to the beneficiary,or alternatively to the physician or supplier if he or she accepts assignmentof the claim.Some beneficiaries have complementary insurance coverage that pays theannual deductible, the 20 percent coinsurance, and any amount by whichthe approved charge of the insurer exceeds the Medicare reasonable charge.In 1969 we established a procedure that allows a complementary insuranceplan meeting certain conditions to pay a physician or supplier an amountthat the physician or supplier accepts as full payment for his servicesand then bill the Medicare carrier for the Part B payment that would otherwisebe made to the beneficiary (42 CFR 405.1685).Until July 1985, we limited the actual use of this procedure, under MedicareCarriers Manual instructions, to employment-related group insurance plans,group practice prepayment plans and HMOs, and, in the case of the lattertwo types of organizations, we made the procedure available only for limitedtypes of services. Moreover, between May 1979 and July 1985, we prohibitedcarriers from accepting new applications by employment-related group insuranceplans to use the procedure. In July 1985, we issued revised Medicare CarrierManual instructions removing many of these limitations.On July 1, 1986 (51 FR 23792), we proposed to amend andSection; 405.1685,as well as other rules that have an impact upon this payment procedure,to implement section 1842(b) of the Act, as amended by section 2339 ofthe Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98-369) commonly referred toas ``DRA''. Section 1842(b)(6) now provides the authority for carriersto pay Medicare Part B benefits, for services that are reimbursable ona reasonable charge or fee schedule basis, to entities that meet the conditionsspecified below, if the beneficiary has agreed in writing for payment tosuch an entity. The entity must be one that_andbullet; Provides coverage of the services under a complementary healthservices plan as described above; andandbullet; Has paid the physician or supplier an amount that includes theamount payable under Medicare and is accepted by the physician or supplieras full payment for the service.Under the broad language of amended section 1842(b)(6) of the Act, anyentity that meets the stated requirements can use the indirect paymentprocedure. This includes employers, unions, insurance companies, and retirementhomes. It also includes prepayment organizations such as HMOs, competitivemedical plans, and other prepaid plans, when they deal with a carrier ratherthan directly with HCFA.The procedure is available only for services paid on a reasonable chargeor fee schedule basis, and only when Medicare is primary payer. It is notavailable for services of providers or of other entitites that are paidunder prospective payment or cost basis systems and is not available whenMedicare is secondary payer.The Act sets forth the indirect payment procedure as an alternative toMedicare payment to the beneficiary on the basis of an itemized bill orto the physician or supplier on the basis of an assignment. Indirect paymentis available even for services furnished by a participating physician orsupplier, that is, one that has agreed to accept assignments.Section 1842(h)(1) of the Act, as amended by section 2306 of the DRA (andas further amended by section 9301(d)(2)(A)(ii) of Pub. L. 99-272), permitsa participating physician or other supplier to accept payment under theindirect payment procedure in lieu of accepting Medicare assignment. Indirectpayment is also available for clinicial diagnostic laboratory tests furnishedby a physician or independent laboratory. Section 1833(h)(5)(C) of theAct, as amended by section 2303 of the DRA, permits a physician or independentlaboratory to accept payment for clinical diagnostic laboratory tests underthe indirect payment procedure in lieu of accepting Medicare assignmentfor those tests. Until December 22, 1987, when a physician or laboratoryused this procedure for clinical diagnostic laboratory tests, Medicarepayment for those tests was subject to deductible and coinsurance and wasnot 100 percent of the fee schedule amount or the actual charge (whicheveris less) as it was when Medicare paid for the tests under assignment. Thiswas changed by section 4085(i)(1) of the Omnibus Budget ReconciliationAct of 1987 Pub. L. 100-203), effective for services furnished on or afterthe date of enactment, December 22, 1987. Deductible and coinsurance nolonger apply to clinical diagnostic laboratory tests for which paymentis made under the indirect payment procedure. <ITAG tagnum="84">Provisions of the Proposed Regulations </ITAG>Since the amendments did not change the essential conditions for use ofthe procedure as set forth in the existing rules, we proposed primarilytechnical changes to conform the rules more closely to the language ofthe law, with minor revisions and clarifications. Specifically, we proposedto amend andSection;andSection; 405.1672, 405.1679, 405.1685, and 405.1686,as discussed below. A. Section 405.1672, Individual's Request For Direct Payment_General ProvisionsA parenthetical statement at the end of andSection; 405.1672(c) indicatedthat ``for payment to organizations that pay bills on behalf of enrollees,see andSection; 405.1685.'' In line with proposed changes in andSection; 405.1685discussed below, we proposed to change this statement to read: ``For paymentto entities that pay for services on behalf of entitled individuals, seeandSection; 405.1685.'' B. Section 405.1679, Execution of Claim For Payment This section made no reference to the indirect payment procedure. It discussedwho could execute a claim for an individual. We proposed to add a new paragraph(e) to clarify that an entity that provides complementary health insuranceand meets the requirements of the indirect payment procedure could executea claim on behalf of the beneficiary under that procedure. The beneficiarywould authorize the entity to receive his or her Part B payments. Section1842(b)(3)(B) of the Act (following clause (ii)), requires that a PartB bill be submitted in such form as is provided by regulations. Section1835(a)(1) of the Act requires (in the case of services furnished by certain``providers of services'') that the beneficiary submit a written requestfor payment ``except in cases in which the Secretary finds it impracticablefor the beneficiary to do so''. Since the main purpose of the indirectpayment procedure is to simplify the billing process, for beneficiariesand for physicians and other suppliers, and since the beneficiary mustgive written authorization for the complementary coverage plan to receivethe Part B payments, we believe that a request for payment signed by thebeneficiary, or a written statement authorizing the plan to submit claimson his or her behalf, is unnecessary. C. Section 405.1685, Payment to Organizations That Pay Bills on Behalfof Enrollees. We proposed to change the title of this section to ``The indirect paymentprocedure.'' All the proposed special requirements for payment under theindirect payment procedure would be set forth in the revised andSection;405.1685(a). We proposed that Medicare Part B payment for the servicesof a physician or supplier otherwise payable to a beneficiary or to hisor her legal representative or representative payee could be made to anentity that provides coverage to the beneficiary under a complementaryhealth benefits plan. (This was to make it clear that payment under theindirect payment procedure is an exception to the rule that benefits thatare not assigned to the physician or supplier must be paid to the beneficiaryor to his or her legal representative or representative payee.) Paragraphs(a)(1) through (a)(6) and (b), discussed below, would specify the requirementsthe entity must meet to receive the payment. To improve technical accuracy, we also proposed to change references throughoutparagraphs (a) and (b) from ``organization'' to ``entity,'' and from ``bills''to ``services.'' Any entity using the indirect payment procedure would have to meet thegeneral criterion set forth in a new andSection; 405.1685(a)(1). This provisionprovided explanatory language to indicate that the plan would have to becomplementary to Medicare, in line with current practice. In paragraph (a)(2) of the proposed regulations we proposed to continuethe current requirement that the entity must have made full payment tothe person furnishing the service. Editorial changes were to be made tofollow the language of the law more closely. In paragraph (a)(3), we proposed to clarify the role of an ``authorizedrepresentative'' of a beneficiary in executing an agreement for MedicarePart B payment to the entity. (We proposed also to revise andSection; 405.1672(c)to provide that any of the persons specified in andSection; 405.1679 couldexecute a claim on behalf of the beneficiary.) We proposed to redesignate current paragraph (a)(3) as paragraph (a)(4)and revise it editorially, and to combine the contents of the current paragraphs(a)(4) and (a)(5) in paragraph (a)(5), requiring that the entity submitany information the carrier needs to meet requirements of the Medicareprogram. In paragraph (a)(6) we proposed to require an entity to have in place aprocess that would identify and exclude from its requests for payment allservices for which Medicare is the secondary payer. This is called forby the provision that the entity may request payment only in cases in whichit pays for the service under a plan complementary to Part B. Section 1862(b)of the Act and 42 CFR 405.316-405.329 indicate when Medicare is secondarypayer. Paragraph (b) of andSection; 405.1685 indicated that the entity could choosenot to pay and claim reimbursement for all Part B bills on behalf of abeneficiary; the entity could establish criteria to determine at its discretionwhich bills it would pay. We proposed to revise the paragraph to show thatthe entity has discretion to determine which services, rather than whichbills, it will pay. In addition, to prevent possible double billing (whenthe entity and the beneficiary bill the carrier for the same service),we proposed to require that the entity undertake to cover, and to pay andclaim reimbursement for, either one or more well defined general categoriesof services, or all Part B services. D. Section 405.1686, Organizations Qualified To Receive Payment on Behalfof Enrollee This section described the types of organizations that could qualify toreceive payment under the indirect payment procedure. Since the availabilityof the indirect payment procedure no longer would be limited to the typesof organizations specified in andSection; 405.1686, we proposed to deletethis section. <ITAG tagnum="84">Response to Comments </ITAG>We received timely comments from a Medicare carrier, a State Medicaid Agency,and a private health benefits plan on the proposed regulations. Becausethere were so few comments and because each commenter's comments are sodistinct from the others, we discuss them individually. The carrier raised a number of issues regarding the administration of theindirect payment provision. These questions and our responses are as follows:<T3>Question</T3>: Will the carrier be required to make programming changesto make deductible and coinsurance applicable to the charges for clinicaldiagnostic laboratory tests furnished by independent laboratories? <T3>Response</T3>: Carriers should not make these programming changes.Under section 4085(i)(1) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987,the Part B deductible and coinsurance no longer apply to charges for clinicaldiagnostic laboratory tests for which payment is made under the indirectpayment procedure. <T3>Question</T3>: Will there be carrier involvement to ascertain thatan entity using the indirect payment procedure meets the requirements ofthe final regulations? <T3>Response</T3>: Yes. The entity will submit its request to use the procedureto the carrier to which it expects to submit the most claims. The carrierwill determine whether the entity meets the requirements and notify HCFA.<T3>Question</T3>: What mechanism will be developed to inform the carrierof the status of the entity? <T3>Response</T3>: HCFA will add the entity to a list of approved entitiesin the Medicare Carriers Manual and assign it a national identificationnumber (``approval number'') to show on its claim. <T3>Question</T3>: How will the carrier determine whether or not a privateinsurance plan should receive Medicare reimbursement, since the plan mightbe obligated by its terms to pay for the service in full regardless ofMedicare?<T3>Response: </T3>In applying to use the indirect payment procedure, theentity must agree to claim payment for a service only when it covers theservice under a plan complementary to Medicare Part B and meets the requirementsfor reimbursement for that service. Medicare beneficiaries who are membersof the plan receive from the carrier an explanation of medical benefitsdetailing the services Medicare paid for and we anticipate that they wouldsoon complain to the carrier or HCFA if Medicare payment is made to a planfor services for which the plan is obligated to pay in full regardlessof Medicare.The State Medicaid agency's comment on the regulations and our responseare as follows:<T3>Comment: </T3>The State Medicaid agency provides payment for medicalservices as a payer of benefits complementary to Medicare. In addition,the agency covers only the amount by which a Part B payment falls shortof the charge approved for the service or the State's fee, whichever isless. Accordingly, the agency believes it should be considered an entityentitled to use the indirect payment procedure.<T3>Response: </T3>While State Medicaid plans are similar in some respectsto health benefits plans complementary to Medicare, we do not regard themas such plans for purposes of using the indirect payment procedure. Unlikeprivate insurance plans, State Medicaid plans generally pay fees lowerthan the fees usually charged in the community. Under the indirect paymentprocedure, the amount the entity pays the physician or supplier for a servicegoes into his customary charge profile. If this amount is less than hisusual charges, the physician's payment level may be penalized. The indirectpayment procedure is designed for use by entities that pay physicians'and suppliers' usual charges.Moreover, State agencies generally pay no more than (if as much as) theMedicare approved charge. There is no disadvantage, therefore, to a physicianor supplier who participates in Medicaid in accepting Medicare assignmentsand submitting Medicare claims directly to the Medicare carrier. Stateagencies have procedures for obtaining Medicare claims information forpurposes of making the supplementary Medicaid payment on these claims.Thus, it would merely create an administrative complication for the Medicareprogram to authorize the use of the indirect payment procedure by States.The health benefits plan made a number of comments objecting to the prohibitionin the proposed regulations against the imposition of any copayment inconnection with the indirect payment procedure. These comments and ourresponses to them are as follows:<T3>Comment: </T3>There is no prohibition in the statute against imposinga copayment.<T3>Response: </T3>While it is true that the prohibition is not statedexplicitly in the statute, it is the most supportable interpretation ofthat part of section 1842(b)(6) of the Act that requires a physician (orsupplier) to accept the plan payment as full payment. This part of thestatutory language could mean either: (1) That the plan must be the entireultimate source of payment for the service (exclusive of Medicare PartB); or (2) that the plan must merely be the entire immediate source ofpayment. The first interpretation would prohibit the billing of a copaymentby either the plan or the physician; the second would merely prohibit thebilling of a copayment by the physician. The first interpretation is moreconsistent with the objectives of the legislation that we stated in ourrecommendation that legislation in this area be initiated. In recommendingthe indirect payment provision to Congress, we stated that the provisionshould be designed to permit the physician to submit a single claim, relievethe beneficiary of any need to file a claim, and protect the beneficiaryagainst any financial liability for the service, if Medicare and the plantogether fully cover the services.We believe that Congress fully agreed with out recommendation and did notcontemplate the collection of a copayment by a plan under the indirectpayment procedure. Congress did not provide guidance in the statute orin the legislative committee reports on determining the permissible amountof any copayment.<T3>Comment: </T3>Prohibiting a copayment limits the availability of theindirect payment procedure and disadvantages carrier-dealing health benefitsplans relative to HMOs that enter into contracts with HCFA and may imposecopayments.<T3>Response: </T3>In the case of a health benefits plan that uses theindirect payment procedure (unlike a health benefits plan that has a contractwith HCFA as an HMO or competitive medical plan), we do not regulate theamount of premiums the plan may charge. For a plan that pays physicianson a fee-for-service basis, this makes the indirect payment procedure anattractive alternative to entering into a risk-capitation contract withHCFA (i.e., a contract under which HCFA pays the plan, as an HMO or competitivemedical plan, a capitation rate with the plan assuming the financial riskof providing services covered under Part A or Part B of Medicare). Permittingthe imposition of a copayment would make the indirect payment procedurean even more attractive alternative to a risk-capitation contract if theplan believes that a copayment would help it to reduce utilization andother costs. Making the indirect payment procedure this attractive, however,conflicts with our initiative encouraging plans to enter into risk-capitationcontracts. We find little basis for permitting such a disincentive to riskcapitation contracts without an explicit statutory requirement to do so.<T3>Comment:</T3> This prohibition precludes use of a copayment as a utilizationcontrol mechanism.<T3>Reponse:</T3> Copayments are certainly one form of utilization control.However, other control exist, such as careful review of claims, partialrefund of premiums to plan members, etc. The indirect payment procedurewas basically intended for Medigap plans that ordinarily do not chargea copayment and that assume full responsibility for the difference betweenthe Medicare payment and the approved charge of the plan. <ITAG tagnum="84">Final Rule</ITAG>While the final rule was under development, HCFA undertook to redesignateall rules on conditions for Medicare payment (including Subpart P of Part405) as a new Part 424. Accordingly, the section numbers of Part 424 aresubstituted in the final rule, as shown in the following discussion.We are adopting the proposed rule as final without substantive changes.For clarity and precision we are making the following editorial revisionsin andSection; 405.1685, which is now andSection; 424.66:1. Provide a more descriptive heading;2. Revise paragraph (a)(6) to require that the entity ``identify and excludefrom its requests for payment all services for which Medicare is secondarypayer * * *.'' (The wording of the proposed rule appeared to emphasizethe process leading to identification rather than exclusion as such.)3. Clarify (in paragraph (b)) that an entity that does not pay and claimreimbursement for all Part B services must establish in advance precisecriteria for determining the services for which it will pay.Language in the proposed rule was misleading.By referring to ``cover'' and ``pay and claim reimbursement for'' in thesame sentence, we created the erroneous impression that the entity mustpay and claim reimbursement for any service that it covers. Actually, anentity's health benefit plans might have copayment requirements or approvedcharge limitations that would prevent it from claiming reimbursement forsome services. Also, an entity might choose to use the indirect paymentprocedure for some of its plans but not others.By stating that an entity must determine which well-defined categoriesof services for which it would pay, we created the erroneous impressionthat there are HCFA-defined categories from which the entity can choose.The paragraph (e) that we proposed to add to andSection; 405.1679, redesignatedas andSection; 424.36, under which an entity authorized to use the indirectpayment procedure could execute a claim on behalf of the beneficiary, appearsin the final rule as paragraph (d).Other proposed changes to andSection; 405.1672 (paragraphs (c) and (d)) becameinappropriate or unnecessary as we simplified our rules in a final rulepublished March 2, 1988 (53 FR 6629). The content of these paragraphs isfound in new andSection; 424.34(a) and andSection; 424.54. In that regard,paragraph (a) of new andSection; 424.66, which includes the content of formerandSection; 405.1686 is being removed, as we proposed and as it is inconsistentwith current law.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Impact Statement</ITAG>A. Executive Order 12291Executive Order (E.O.) 12291 requires us to prepare and publish a finalregulatory impact analysis for any final regulation that meets one of theE.O. criteria for a ``major rule''; that is, that would be likely to resultin: An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; a major increasein costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State,or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or, significant adverseeffects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation,or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises in domestic or export markets. While this rule may result inadministrative savings because it will permit the physician or supplierto file a single claim and receive payment in a single check, the overalleffect will be negligible. Coverage and payment amounts will not be affected.Therefore, because no threshold criteria under E.O. 12291 will be exceeded,this rule is not considered a major rule and an impact analysis is notrequired.B. Regulatory Flexibility ActWe generally prepare a final regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistentwith the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612), unlessthe Secretary certifies that a final regulation will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposesof the RFA, States and individuals are not small entites, but we treatall physicians or suppliers as small entities. While, in some cases, physiciansor suppliers may benefit slightly because a single claim will be permittedfor a given service, the overall impact on the physician or supplier willbe minimal.For these reasons, we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, thatthis final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities, and we have therefore not prepared a regulatoryflexibility analysis.C. Paperwork Reduction ActThese changes will not impose paperwork collection requirements. Consequently,they need not be reviewed by the Executive Office of Management and Budget(EOMB) under the authority of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C.3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>42 CFR Part 405Administrative practice and procedure, Health facilities, Health professions,Kidney diseases, Laboratories, Medicare, Nursing homes, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements, Rural areas, X-rays.42 CFR Part 424Administrative practice and procedure, Conditions for payment, Medicareclaims, Physician certification, Plan of treatment, Request for payment.42 CFR Part 424 is amended as set forth below:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 424_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
