Seen as a ready source of settlement or award money, they are increasingly being included as defendants in lawsuits that traditionally named only the failed companies, underwriters and accountants.    While the number of such suits is still small, and securities law remains highly lucrative, insurers and legal professionals say the actions carry enormous risk for lawyers because of the huge sums of money often involved in the offerings.    &quot;This is an area where big money is being lost, and big damages are being sought by people who have the inclination and resources to seek compensation from everybody and anybody involved in the fiasco,&quot; contends Robert O'Malley, loss-prevention counsel for Bermuda-based Attorneys Liability Assurance Society, a member-owned carrier that insures some 34,000 lawyers. Securities-related cases account for almost 75% -- or $35 million -- of all claims ALAS has paid since it was founded in 1979.    Nearly all such suits are settled, according to lawyers and insurance specialists, and the terms kept confidential. In the past two years, though, a number of large settlements involving leading law firms have rocked the profession.    Last year, for example, Rogers andamp; Wells in New York paid $40 million to settle claims it had aided and abetted frauds by J. David andamp; Co., a collapsed San Diego investment firm. An attorney for Rogers andamp; Wells, one of J. David's main law firms, has said it decided to settle after weighing the cost and uncertainty of litigation; the firm declines to comment further.    The main reason for including securities lawyers as defendants is simple: They usually have sizable insurance policies. &quot;Investors know today there is only one or two deep pockets around&quot; in a suit over a failed initial public offering, says Joseph Cotchett, a San Francisco plaintiff's lawyer, &quot;and it is not the company that did the offering -- they're belly-up.&quot;    At the same time, other lawyers note, courts are increasingly unwilling to let lawyers get out of suits on grounds that they were, say, merely performing routine legal work. And when law firms lose preliminary motions to dismiss such suits, they almost always then look to settle them to avoid adverse publicity. &quot;There aren't too many lawyers who want to tell their clients, 'I'm busy working on my fraud suit,'&quot; says Dennis Horan, a Chicago lawyer who defends other lawyers.    Most of the suits contend that the prospectus or other disclosure documents contained misrepresentations or omissions, and that the lawyer knew of them but failed to do anything. Part of the legal basis for such claims was laid in a 1968 case in which a federal circuit appeals court rejected a lawyer's argument that he shouldn't be held liable because he had merely drafted an offering circular relying on information provided by his client. The court ruled that a lawyer can't &quot;escape liability for fraud by closing his eyes to what he saw and could readily understand.&quot;    While subsequent court decisions have been widely inconsistent, some of them suggest that lawyers could be exposed to liability even when performing only routine services. In a 1985 ruling, for instance, a district court in Illinois said that a lawyer who merely gave an opinion about title on oil and gas leases could be held liable because the opinions were a &quot;substantial factor&quot; in the sale of the security.    But lawyers are most open to liability when they step out of their role as legal technicians and play a more active part. Mr. Horan, the Chicago lawyer, says lawyers are particularly vulnerable when they undertake such activities as promoting transactions, finding investors and financing, conducting meetings on the law firm's premises and becoming tied to client companies as directors or general partners.    In those circumstances, the lawyer may be deemed a &quot;seller&quot; of the security, making it easier for the plaintiff to claim the &quot;lawyer was more interested in seeing the security sell and make a personal profit&quot; than in preparing a careful disclosure statement, says ALAS's Mr. O'Malley.    A growing number of law firms now strongly discourage or prohibit partners from serving on boards or investing in clients' businesses. Mr. O'Malley says he also counsels firms to be extremely vigilant when confronted with what he calls the &quot;fatal three&quot; factors in terms of malpractice risk: a new client, a start-up enterprise and an initial public offering. He calls &quot;insane&quot; the practice at most law firms by which a single partner can commit the firm to representation.    Meanwhile, the flurry of suits has presented lawyers with a difficult ethical and legal dilemma. In some cases, Mr. Horan explains, lawyers have come across material information on a business that the client refuses to include in the prospectus. &quot;The question is, What does the lawyer do then?&quot; he says. By speaking out, a lawyer might be violating confidentiality, and his client could later sue if the transaction was killed. But a lawyer who says nothing, he adds, can later be sued by investors for taking part in a fraudulent action. </TEXT></DOC>
