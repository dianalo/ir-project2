Inc. (Vector) to amend DOE/FE Opinion andOrder No. 308 (Order 308) (April 24, 1989, 1 FE Para. 70,217) that grantsVector authority to import up to 13.14 Bcf per year of Canadian naturalgas over a term beginning December 1, 1989, through November 30, 2009.Vector asks that its authorization be amended because, subsequent to theissue of Order 308, some of the pricing provisions in the gas sale andpurchase agreements for the proposed import were amended to conform tocertain National Energy Board requirements to obtain a Canadian exportlicense. The application is filed under section 3 of the Natural Gas Act and DOEDelegation Order Nos. 0204-111 and 0204-127.

The principal business of Vector is thatof an oil and gas producer and marketer with markets in the U.S. and Canada.Order 308 authorized Vector to import natural gas from Canada ``in accordancewith the arrangement proposed in the application in this proceeding'' tofuel a new 162 MW cogenerator being constructed by Altresco PittsfieldL.P. (Altresco) at the General Electric manufacturing and research facilityin Pittsfield, Massachusetts. Amendments to some of the pricing provisionsin the gas sale and purchase agreements between Vector and the seven Albertaproducers contracted to supply the proposed import have altered some ofthe elements of the pricing mechanism authorized in Order 308. Consequently,Vector requests an amended authorization that takes into account the recentcontractual amendments. On July 24, 1989, Vector, the seven Alberta producers, Altresco, and NewEngland Power, the ultimate purchaser of the power produced by the cogenerationfacility, renegotiated certain terms of the June 24, 1988, Agreement andthe June 29, 1988, Agreement which underlie the proposed project. Vectorstates that the contract amendments can be summarized as follows: (1) The ``Base Price'' specified in Schedule ``B'' of the agreements hasbeen changed to $1.26 (U.S.) per MMBtu from $1.12 (U.S.) per MMBtu. (2) The ``Index'' specified in Schedule ``A'' to the agreements, and usedin calculating the gas price in section 1.1(o), has been revised to 50%oil, 40% Tennessee WACOG, 10% coal, from 50% oil, 25% Tennessee WACOG,25% Coal; and (3) The ``Base Index'' specified in Section 1.1(b) of the agreements, andused in calculating the gas price in Section 1.1(o) has been changed to$2.05 (U.S.) per MMBtu from $2.16 (U.S.) per MMBtu (reflecting a changein the base year to the first half of 1989 from 1987). Vector states that the renegotiated terms of the gas sale and purchaseagreements are consistent with the DOE policy guidelines and terms of Order308. According to Vector, the renegotiated indexing provisions are moreheavily weighted toward U.S. natural gas costs. Vector states that therewere no changes to the contract price renegotiation provisions designedto ensure that the imported gas will be competitive with U.S. natural gasand other fuels. Further, Vector states that there has been no change withrespect to the demonstrated need for the gas supplies or the contractualwarranty obligations of the suppliers. Therefore, Vector requests thatOrder 308 be amended only to the extent necessary to reflect the pricingamendments to the gas supply and purchase agreements, and that no otherchanges be made to the terms states in Order 308.The decision on this application will be made consistent with the DOE'snatural gas import policy guidelines, under which the competitiveness ofan import arrangement in the markets served is the primary considerationin determining whether it is in the public interest (49 FR 6684, February22, 1984). Other matters that may be considered in making a public interestdetermination in a long-term arrangement such as this include need forgas and security of the long-term supply. Parties that may oppose thisapplication should comment in their responses on the issues of competitiveness,need for the gas, and security of supply as set forth in the policy guidelines.The applicant asserts that this amended import arrangement continues tobe competitive, needed, and secure. Parties opposing the arrangement bearthe burden of overcoming these assertions.All parties should be aware that if the requested amended import is approved,the authorization will continue to be conditioned on the filing of quarterlyreports indicating volumes imported and the purchase price. Further, allparties should be aware that FE intends to review the entire import arrangement.<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comment Procedures</ITAG>In response to this notice, any person may file a protest, motion to interveneor notice of intervention, as applicable, and written comments.
