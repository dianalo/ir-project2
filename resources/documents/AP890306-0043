It also gave a new, lower deathtoll.   A nighttime curfew remained in effect in the capital and thecountry was still under martial law, which allows soldiers to searchhouses without warrants and detain suspects indefinitely withoutcharge.   Isolated gunfire was heard in the capital early Sunday, but therehave been no significant disturbances since Friday.   The rioting, which began Feb. 27, was sparked by increases in busfares and other price increases mandated under an austerity plandemanded by foreign creditors.   In a nationwide television broadcast, an aide to President CarlosAndres Perez revised downward the government's tally of the numberof dead and wounded from the rioting, which began Feb. 27.   He said 246 people were killed _ down from Perez's previousestimate of at least 300. Figueredo said 1,800 people were injured,compared to earlier reports of at least 2,000.   No explanation was given for the new figures, which were muchlower than newspaper reports putting the death toll as high as 600and the number of wounded at several thousand.   Two Caracas hospitals alone reported treating 2,300.   Figueredo said during Saturday night's broadcast that thegovernment was starting to reopen schools because unrest has ``beencontrolled and the situation ... has returned to completenormality.''   He said classes would resume today for kindergarten through sixthgrade and begin later in the week for older students.   It was unclear when universities would reopen. Universities havetraditionally been centers of protest of government economicpolicies.   The riots and looting broke out after sharp rises in bus fares,gasoline and other basic consumer goods and services.   With its oil-based economy, Venezuela enjoyed prosperity duringthe 1970s but saw its fortunes sharply decline with the price of oilin 1981.   The country's $33 billion foreign debt makes it Latin America'sfourth-largest debtor nation behind Brazil, Mexico and Argentina.   People filed into the Caracas central morgue Sunday trying tofind missing relatives.   Azucena Correa, spokeswoman for a newly formed Committee for theMissing, said her group had a list of hundreds of people who couldnot be located. She said many were assumed to be in militarycustody, and she accused authorities of holding back information.   ``We've gone to the interior minister, we've gone to the police,but so far nothing,'' she said.   ``We even have the names of children, some under the age of 7,who haven't been seen in their homes since the violence began,'' Ms.Correa added.   The auxiliary Roman Catholic bishop of Caracas, Monsignor JorgeSabino Uroza said Sunday that the riots were a product of povertyand frustration, and said powerful business interests and governmentleaders shared the blame.   Celebrating Mass at Caracas' Central Cathedral, Uroza said``there are those that sacked stores, and they should seek pardon;but there are also those, especially economic and political sectors,that have sacked the country for years. They should also seekpardon.''</TEXT></DOC>
