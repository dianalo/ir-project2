While thisseems slightly mad to us today, I have heard of people inParis and New Haven, Conn., who subscribe to the equallybarmy belief that the world is made of words or &quot;texts.&quot; Inany case, the Pythagoreans were the first to discover thenumerical basis of harmony in music, and hence the linkbetween mathematics and beauty. They also thought, historianstell us, that it was sinful to eat beans.   I do not know whether John Allen Paulos abstains frombeans, but, as a self-avowed &quot;numbers man,&quot; he does seem tobe a bit of a neo-Pythagorean. Two years ago Mr. Paulos wrotea surprise best seller called &quot;Innumeracy&quot; that was both alament for the inability of Americans to think about theworld mathematically and an entertaining attempt to dosomething about it. Now this Temple University professor hasproduced a follow-up volume, &quot;Beyond Numeracy: Ruminations ofa Numbers Man&quot; (Knopf, 285 pages, $22), for those who wouldlike to be initiated into the higher mysteries.</LP><TEXT>   It is in essence a tour through 70 topics in mathematics:some elementary (algebra, matrices), some advanced (topology,platonic solids), some avant-garde (chaos theory) and somephilosophical (the fractal nature of consciousness,mathematics in ethics, math and humor).   His brief essays are arranged alphabetically by topic, andas with one of its precursors, Voltaire's &quot;PhilosophicalDictionary,&quot; it makes for an often-jolly little book. Also areassuring one: In his discussion of probability, Mr. Paulosnotes that if you add up the chances of being murdered by allthe terrorists, muggers, serial killers, drunk drivers andother homicidal types in the world, the probability isgreater that you will kill yourself.   The main point of any book such as this should be toconvince mathematical philistines of the keen pitch ofaesthetic pleasure the subject affords. Beauty, indeed, isthe paramount criterion of good mathematics; as the greatEnglish number theorist G.H. Hardy once remarked, &quot;There isno permanent place in the world for ugly mathematics.&quot; This,of course, will come as a surprise to the vast majority ofeducated people who never got beyond calculus, for &quot;schoolmathematics&quot; is extremely dull and is usually taught in themost unimaginative possible way.   Mr. Paulos does reasonably well in conveying the aestheticappeal of mathematics. He presents Euclid's proof that thereare infinitely many prime numbers, which exemplifies theelements of economy, surprise and inevitability that go tomake up mathematical elegance. He also gives a nice, simpleaccount of the different orders of infinity, an awesome ideathat everyone really ought to know about -- although perhapsnot too much, considering that the man who discovered them inthe late 19th century, Georg Cantor, came to a rather stickyand demented end.   Several essays draw connections between mathematics andthe arts. The author explains the &quot;golden section,&quot; a ratioheavily exploited by the designers of the Parthenon and atone time believed to be the universal key to beauty in natureand art. He delves into the mathematical basis of music. Andhe provides a much-needed -- for Americans, at least --introduction to a French society of mathematically inclinedlitterateurs called OULIPO (the French acronym for Workshopof Potential Literature). Typical of their output is RaymondQueneau's &quot;Cent mille milliards poemes.&quot; Achieved by acombinatoric sleight of hand, this sequence of one hundredtrillion sonnets -- which Mr. Paulos, in what one hopes is arare lapse for a numbers man, miscalculates as a mere 10trillion -- dwarfs the rest of the world's poetic output.   Where Mr. Paulos goes wrong, I feel, is in seeingmathematics as a font of practical wisdom. It is true thatthose who have some grounding in probability and statisticsare less likely than innumerates to be gulled by astrologers,bureaucrats and other charlatans. But this is lowbrowmathematics. Real mathematics has almost nothing to do withthe world of affairs. The theory of numbers, for example, isperhaps the most daunting yet aesthetically gratifying areaof mathematics; it is also supremely useless -- &quot;l'art pourl'art.&quot;   Moreover, those who spend too much time communing withabstract mathematical entities tend to behave in an arrogant,foolish, even mischievous manner when it comes to practicalmatters. A case in point is one of Mr. Paulos's heroes,Bertrand Russell. Of this sometimes pacifist, sometimesatomic saber-rattler, full-time scourge of U.S. foreignpolicy, the historian G.M. Trevelyan aptly remarked: &quot;He maybe a genius at mathematics -- as to that I am no judge; buthe is a perfect goose at politics.&quot;   If there is much to take issue with in &quot;Beyond Numeracy,&quot;there is also much to be amused and enlightened by. The lorehas it that when Pythagoras discovered his great theorem onright triangles, he was so transported that he sacrificed 100head of oxen to the gods as a token of gratitude. On thisscale, Mr. Paulos's book is surely worth an ox or two.   ---   Mr. Holt, an erstwhile mathematician, is a columnist forthe Literary Review (London).</TEXT></DOC>
