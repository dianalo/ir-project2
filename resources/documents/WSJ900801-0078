If the gene can be found, tests could be developed thatcould tell which smokers are likely to die of lung cancerearly in life and which might resist the disease until latein life or never contract it.</LP><TEXT>   Two newly published research reports are the firmest proofyet that a susceptibility to lung cancer can be passed fromgeneration to generation, and may explain why lung cancer isrelatively common in some families.   &quot;Cigarette smoking is unequivocally the most importantreason why most Americans are struck with this disease,&quot; saidNeil E. Caporaso, a researcher at the National CancerInstitute in Bethesda, Md. and lead investigator of one ofthe studies. &quot;Yet, scientists have puzzled over why somesmokers get cancer and others don't, why only one in eightsmokers gets the disease. Genetic factors may explain why.&quot;   The researchers haven't identified the culprit gene, nordo they expect to find it immediately. But their reportsshine a bright light as to where other scientists shouldlook, and are expected to trigger a race among molecularbiologists to find a lung-cancer susceptibility gene as partof the world-wide effort to map the human genome, thecollection of all human genes.   Lawyers on both sides of the tobacco liability issuepredicted that the new research on the origins of cancercould have an impact on tobacco liability suits. But bothsides said that the new findings could help their arguments.   Tobacco manufacturers have routinely argued thatscientists have failed to prove a direct biologicalconnection between smoking and lung cancer. Some attorneyswho represent tobacco companies suggested that new evidencethat some people are genetically predisposed to developingcancer will further bolster their case by casting furtherdoubt on the origins of disease.   But Marc Edell, a New Jersey attorney who representsplaintiffs in tobacco liability suits, said the findingswon't be damaging to plaintiffs. If anything, Mr. Edell said,the notion that some consumers might be more vulnerable todisease could mean that manufacturers would be required toadd tougher labels to packages and advertising. &quot;This wouldmake it more important than ever for manufacturers to warnconsumers specifically about the risks they face,&quot; he said.   NCI officials are concerned that the findings may leadsome to believe it may be safe for people without the gene tosmoke. They note cigarette smoking also causes heart diseaseand emphysema.   &quot;It's our belief that everyone who smokes has some risk ofcancer,&quot; says Curt Harris, chief of the NCI's laboratory ofhuman carcinogenesis. &quot;We think the gene research will pointout who has a higher, perhaps even much higher, risk thannormal.&quot;   The new research appears in the most recent issue of theJournal of the National Cancer Institute. In one report,scientists at Louisiana State University Medical Center inNew Orleans and at Albert Einstein College in New York saythat by studying the occurrence of lung cancer in over 300southern Louisiana families, they found that the diseasestruck within the families as if due to a single inheritablegene.   The researchers, led by Thomas A. Sellers, compared thedisease pattern in three generations of these families withthe random rate of lung cancer in a similar number ofLouisiana families. The cancer families had been gatheredbetween 1976 and 1979, and in 1981, Mr. Sellers, a graduatestudent, began analyzing the disease using new computerprograms.   The analysis strongly suggests that inheriting aparticular gene sharply raises the likelihood of getting lungcancer for smokers and nonsmokers. The study found that aperson who inherits two copies of the culprit gene -- onefrom each parent -- and doesn't smoke has a 14% chance ofgetting the cancer by age 50. That risk jumps to 27% by age50 if the person was a heavy smoker.   Inheriting just one copy of the gene, a more likelyoccurrence for most people, raises the risk of cancer, butmostly for cigarette smokers. At age 50, a nonsmoker with onecopy of the gene has practically no risk at all. But for aheavy smoker that risk rises to 5% by age 50, to 16% by age60, and to 25% by age 70. By age 60 a heavy smoker with onecopy of the gene is 6.5 times more likely to get lung cancerthan a heavy smoker without the gene.   George E. Bonney, a geneticist at Howard University inWashington and an expert in analyzing gene patterns infamilies, writes in an accompanying article in the NCIjournal that the sample size of the study is &quot;so large&quot; thatfindings are &quot;unlikely to be false.&quot; Mr. Sellers, now atUniversity of Minnesota in Minneapolis, says researchers arecollecting blood from family members in an effort to locatethe offending gene in the families' DNA, or genetic material.   In a second report in the same issue of the journal,scientists at the cancer institute point to a particular geneas the possible culprit. In a study led by Mr. Caporaso,researchers say they found that some people inherit a genetictrait that makes them more likely to activate cancer-causingchemicals contained in cigarette smoke.   The scientists found that people who quickly metabolize,or process, a blood pressure drug called debrisoquine seem tohave a six times higher risk of lung cancer than people whoprocess the drug slowly. In 1984, some scientists suggestedthat the drug might provide a clue to inheriting asusceptibility to cancer when they found that certain peoplewho took the drug passed out, meaning large amounts ofprocessed drug reached the brain. By studying numerousfamilies, the researchers found that the &quot;fast metabolizing&quot;characteristic occurred as if due to a single inherited gene.   The NCI scientists compared the occurrence of thismetabolizing trait in lung cancer patients with itsoccurrence in a random sample of smokers. Their analysisshowed a strong link between the trait, lung cancer andsmoking. Scientists already know that a particular enzyme isresponsible for processing the drug, and that the enzyme isproduced in cells by a gene located on chromosome 22. Thereare 23 matched pairs of chromosomes in every cell.   &quot;What we think is either this gene or a gene located nearit on chromosome 22 also processes one of the manycarcinogens contained in cigarette smoke,&quot; Mr. Caporaso says.   Mr. Harris of the NCI says that scientists in Switzerlandare working on a test that could detect the presence of theenzyme gene in people's blood. &quot;A smoker who has this genemight want to take periodic chest X-rays,&quot; he says. &quot;Lungcancer is treatable if caught early.&quot;   Mr. Harris says the latest gene finding suggests that asmany as five or 10 genes are involved in the development oflung cancer. Some of the genes may be inherited, and some maybe damaged, perhaps by chemicals in cigarette smoke.   ---   Kathleen Deveny contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
