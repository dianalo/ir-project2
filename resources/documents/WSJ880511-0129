Senate Republicans blocked consideration of a motion to strip from the already-passed measure proposed limits on Alaskan oil exports. The House, making unusual use of congressional procedures, last week voted to drop the Alaska oil provisions; the move was designed partly to persuade Alaska's two Republican senators to vote later to override an expected presidential veto.    The result of the procedural wrangling was that the bill will now go to the president, perhaps as early as today, complete with the Alaska oil provisions. Although the administration has objected to a number of parts of the bill, the Alaska provisions are one of two portions of the bill that President Reagan has cited in recent threats to veto the legislation. The other provision specifically noted by the president generally would require employers to give advance notice before closing plants.    Besides trying to win an override fight, Democrats had hoped by stripping the Alaska oil provisions from the bill to dramatize President Reagan's opposition to the proposed plant-closing requirement prior to the November elections.    Top Democrats in the House planned to send the trade bill to the president today with a show of support for the plant-closing provision. In their latest attempt to spotlight Republican opposition to the notice requirement and make it a political issue, the House leadership planned to hold a news conference with workers who have been laid off without any notice.    &quot;The trade bill is going to go down to the president this week,&quot; said Sen. Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.) after the Senate failed to amend the legislation. &quot;This was one last chance to remove one of those obstacles&quot; the president has identified, he added.    Sen. Byrd sought to bring up the House motion to amend the bill under a procedure requiring the unanimous consent of all senators. But Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole (R., Kan.) objected, effectively preventing the special resolution from being considered. Sen. Dole warned that if the resolution went to the floor, it would open up the entire trade bill to other amendments as well as the House one.    &quot;We could have a full-scale trade-bill debate here for days,&quot; Sen. Dole said, noting that several Republicans would like to remove other provisions. &quot;This may portend what could happen if there's a veto,&quot; he added.    Some lawmakers and administration officials have said that if Congress eventually fails to override a veto, they would favor a new version of the trade bill stripped of the Alaska-oil and plant-closing provisions. But Sen. Byrd said yesterday's action illustrated &quot;the problems in coming forward with another trade bill.&quot; The House passed the trade bill by a large enough margin to override a veto, but the Senate vote fell three votes short of the necessary two-thirds majority.    The Alaska oil provision would limit exports of petroleum products from future Alaskan refineries to 70,000 barrels a day, and would require that crude oil exported to Canada from Alaska under the U.S.-Canada free-trade agreement be shipped through the lower 48 states.    Separately, the Senate Finance Committee began consideration of the U.S.-Canada free-trade agreement, which needs congressional approval. The panel didn't make any decisions. On the House side, the Ways and Means Committee also is working on legislation that would implement the trade pact; it is expected to meet today with administration officials to go over the agreement.    Senate Finance Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas) said he expects the House and Senate to finish the U.S.-Canada legislation in a couple of weeks and to begin a House-Senate conference the week of May 23. </TEXT></DOC>
