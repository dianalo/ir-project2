In Zeeland, Mich., HermanMiller, an office furniture maker, and Gentex Corp., arear-view-mirror firm, work employees longer because, as atChrysler, sales are up only for certain products.   On average, U.S. workers put in 3.8 hours overtime perweek in August, the same as a year ago and up from afive-year low of 3.3 hours in February through April. Plantsuse more overtime &quot;because they laid off so much of the workforce,&quot; says Michael Blumenfeld, president of BSN Corp., aDallas sporting-goods maker. He says three to six months ofincreased overtime will suggest a true recovery.   Craftmade International, a Grand Prairie, Texas,ceiling-fan and light-kit maker, works its employeesnine-hour days and has added employees, too.                                                                                                          UNION CHIEFS bite the dust, as rank-and-filers growrestless.   In rail labor, veterans Fred Hardin of the UnitedTransportation Union, the Locomotive Engineers' LarryMcFather and Richard Kilroy of the TransportationCommunications Union lose re-election bids after newcontracts anger members. Mac Fleming, who ousted aMaintenance of Way Employees incumbent last year, survives arecall effort.   Susan Bianchi-Sand, the Flight Attendants president, isbeaten, joining Steve Bell of the Air Traffic Controllers.The Carpenters' Sigurd Lucassen faces a tough challenge, butheads of the Ironworkers and the Elevator Constructors fightoff opponents. &quot;Anybody who says he can do better has a goodsell, whether he can or not,&quot; an AFL-CIO official says.                                                                                                          THEY NEED ENGINEERS, right? Yes, but some are sought morethan others.   Chemical, electronic and computer system engineers rankhigh in work prospects, says Malcolm Cohen, head of theUniversity of Michigan labor relations institute.Environmental, chemical, electronic, safety and processengineers also are in big demand, according to Fluor,Southern Co., an Atlanta-based utility holding firm; CRSSInc., an architectural firm; Lyondell Petrochemical; andRockwell International.   Advanced Telecommunications will double its engineeringstaff by 1995; it says its future hinges on how well softwareand other electronics engineers keep it &quot;on the cutting edge&quot;of technology. Scientific-Atlanta says engineers must workwith customers more. But civil-structural, plant andold-style electrical engineers are less wanted, say Fluor,Advanced and Southern.   Colleges turn out too few safety, environmental andprocess engineers, Lyondell Petrochemical and CRSS complain.                                                                                                          OSHA ADMINISTRATOR Gerard Scannell warns North CarolinaLabor Commissioner John Brooks that OSHA can take over thestate's workplace safety program. He says he's &quot;disappointed&quot;that Mr. Brooks won't accept federal criminal investigatoryhelp for probing the recent fire that killed 25 Imperial FoodProducts workers.                                                                                                          THE FIRST REQUEST for help from families of the 25poultry-plant workers was for clothing for the bodies and fortheir relatives to wear to the funerals. Labor unions oftenprovide assistance after such work-site tragedies.                                                                                                          VACATIONS FOR SALE: Some 30% of employees would buy extravacation days without pay, while 10% would &quot;sell&quot; theirvacations, taking cash instead, according to a poll byconsultant Foster Higgins. A fifth of the surveyed 274employers that have flexible benefits offer thevacation-trading option.                                                                                                          HEALTH CARE MANAGERS' pay, after lagging, this year forgedahead of the salaries of other executives -- by 2% forhospital chiefs and 8% for officials in health managementfirms, a Hay Group survey shows. Their total compensation,including bonuses, is still 8% to 19% behind, but that gapcould vanish next year, says Hay.                                                                                                          HOME CARE for mildly ill children is provided to workersby some services.   On the Mend, a Norwalk, Conn., firm, will send care giversto the homes of working parents to tend sick children. Someemployers pay the $16-an-hour cost. Others, including Xerox,Olin and Perkin-Elmer, pay an annual $5,000 administrativefee and trim the hourly charge to $9. The care givers aretrained in first aid and preparing meals.   The service reduces employee worries about leaving sickoffspring at home, says Carol Blaszczynski, a Perkin-Elmerspokeswoman. The Tucson (Ariz.) Association for Child Caresays employers subsidize two-thirds of its clients.   About 20% of revenues of Parents in a Pinch, Brookline,Mass., come from its three-year-old service for corporateemployees.                                                                                                          THE CHECKOFF: OSHA drops Union Carbide's Seadrift, Texas,plant from a federal program recognizing exemplary safetyefforts; a fire and explosion there in March killed a workerand injured 32. . . . &quot;Invisible Diversity,&quot; the firstnational gay and lesbian corporate workplace conference, willbe held Friday in New York. . . .
