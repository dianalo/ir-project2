Under terms of the merger, each Citizen Fidelity share will be exchanged for 0.77 share of PNC's common. Citizens will operate under its name and become a subsidiary of PNC. PNC and Citizens are both bank holding companies.    PNC had assets of about $22.2 billion at Dec. 31, while Citizens had assets of about $4.7 billion at the end of 1986. </TEXT></DOC>
