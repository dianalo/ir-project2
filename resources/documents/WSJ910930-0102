The 147-year-old law firm was a victim of New England'sdepressed economic climate, but it also suffered as a resultof bitter internal bickering among its partners over itsmanagement.</LP><TEXT>   Gaston andamp; Snow was saddled with approximately $20 millionin bank debt. About 80 lawyers had left the law firm in thelast five years. Roughly 150 lawyers remained.   Late last week, the partners voted to dissolve thepartnership and reform as Gaston and Snow -- without theampersand. The new arrangement, the law firm said in astatement, would allow it to continue to serve clients&quot;unencumbered by the old firm's debts.&quot;   Gaston and Snow is expected to have about 90 lawyers.Between 10 and 15 partners will not make the transition tothe new law firm, said Richard N. Hoehn, the chairman of itsexecutive committee.   Mr. Hoehn said the law firm expects to close its New Yorkand Washington branches, with a total of about 20 lawyers.The law firm is considering closing its approximately10-lawyer San Francisco office but will maintain its Phoenix,Ariz., branch, with about 10 lawyers.   &quot;The fact of the dissolution is somewhat technical,&quot; saidMr. Hoehn. &quot;The business is there and it is alive and it willcontinue onward.&quot; He said that &quot;on an ongoing basis it wasunfair for the partners who were left to bear the liabilitiesof the firm alone.&quot;   Gaston andamp; Snow has tried to hold itself together despite asteady stream of partner defections. It recently retainedFrancis Musselman, the court-appointed trustee in thebankruptcy proceedings of Finley, Kumble, Wagner, Heine,Underberg, Manley, Myerson andamp; Casey, as a consultant.   Mr. Hoehn said Gaston andamp; Snow &quot;hopefully&quot; would fully repayits lenders, Shawmut National Corp. and BayBanks Inc., bothof Boston. Mr. Musselman said the dissolving law firm hasabout $41 million in accounts receivable. The new law firm,he said, will be financed by a roughly $5.3 million loan fromits predecessor.   That loan raised the ire of recently departed partners,some of whom are still owed money from Gaston andamp; Snow. &quot;Overmy dead body,&quot; said former partner Stephen E. Estroff, whodefected to the New York law firm Lord Day andamp; Lord, BarrettSmith this summer. &quot;I think the lawyers are going to have afield day with that one.&quot;   Leslie D. Corwin, a New York lawyer for Mr. Estroff andseven other former Gaston andamp; Snow partners, said, &quot;They haveno right to use the assets of the old firm.&quot; He said he &quot;veryseriously doubts&quot; that the law firm can reconstitute usingthe old law firm's assets, a similar name and the sameoffices, under partnership law and the terms of Gaston andamp;Snow's partnership agreement.   &quot;We clearly believe that what we're doing meets allstandards,&quot; said Gaston and Snow partner James J. Marcellino.Mr. Musselman added that former partners would benefit fromthe loan because it would allow the dissolving law firm torealize &quot;much more of its assets.&quot;   Bruce S. Sperling, a Chicago lawyer not involved in theGaston andamp; Snow dispute, called the loan &quot;a very unusualfinancial move.&quot; Mr. Sperling, who has counseled lawyersinvolved in law firm breakups, said, &quot;absent agreement of allpartners of the dissolved entity, I've never seen apartnership in dissolution loan any of its assets to anotherentity.&quot;   The economic downturn has forced a growing number of lawfirms previously considered to be almost invincible todisband.   &quot;There's more on the horizon,&quot; said Bradford W.Hildebrandt, a law firm management consultant who says he nowspends most of his time representing law firms in financialtrouble.   &quot;Bank debt for U.S. law firms is at an all-time high,&quot; Mr.Hildenbrandt said. &quot;A lot of it came from expansion in thelate '80s. A lot of it came from taking a lot of office spacefirms didn't need and bringing in lateral partners.&quot;   ---   BROADCASTING licenses can't be used as security for loans,judge rules.   U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Robert Martin ruled that FleetBank of Massachusetts, Chemical Banking Corp.'s Chemical Bankunit and six other banks have no right under the federalCommunications Act to be granted liens on 11 broadcastinglicenses held by Tak Communications Inc. Fleet Bank wasformerly Bank of New England, which was acquired byFleet/Norstar Financial Group Inc.   The ruling has implications beyond the case because itcomes at a time when the Federal Communications Commissionhas said it will re-examine the section of the act thatrestricts the transfer of broadcasting licenses. Under theCommunications Act, the FCC awards licenses permittingbroadcasters to use the airwaves, although in theory thepublic owns the airwaves.   The act states that licenses can't be transferred,assigned or disposed of without FCC approval. Bankers andother lenders, however, have asked the FCC to review the law,arguing that they need security in the licenses, abroadcaster's most valuable asset, because the recession hascrippled the owners' ability to repay their debts.   In the matter decided last week by Judge Martin, ofMadison, Wis., the banks unsuccessfully argued in a pretrialmotion that broadcast licenses were no different from otherbusiness licenses. Tak, based in Vienna, Va., early this yearfiled for protection under Chapter 11 of the federalBankruptcy Code and owes the banks about $175 million. Thecompany owns nine television and radio stations, some ofwhich are in Wisconsin. Tak agreed to give the banks amortgage on the company's real property and a lien on itstangible and intangible personal property.   Tak argued that there was no need for the dispute over thelicenses to go to trial because the terms of the agreementstated that it was limited by federal law. Brady Williamson,a Madison attorney for Tak, said neither the FCC nor thecourts have recognized or permitted a broadcasting license tobe used as a security interest.   Lawyers and spokespeople for the banks couldn't be reachedfor comment.   ---   RETIRED COOK COUNTY JUDGE is indicted.   A federal jury indicted Thomas J. Maloney on bribery andextortion charges, the latest move in the Chicago U.S.attorney's probe of court corruption in the city.   Also indicted were two Chicago attorneys, Robert McGee,who allegedly carried bribe money from attorneys tothen-Judge Maloney; and William A. Swano, who is charged withpaying bribes to fix the results of cases before the formerjudge.   In an indictment unsealed Friday, Mr. Maloney was chargedwith racketeering, conspiracy, extortion and obstruction ofjustice. The indictment alleges, among other things, that heaccepted money in exchange for an acquittal in a Chinatownmurder trial he heard without a jury in 1981, and assuredthat a defendant in a 1986 gang-murder trial was acquittedand found guilty of a lesser charge of manslaughter.   The indictment claims Mr. Maloney returned bribe money inone case in which he &quot;sensed excessive public attention.&quot;   In addition, prosecutors allege that the former judgetried to obstruct justice by attempting to convinceco-defendant Mr. Swano to refuse to cooperate with thegovernment's investigation into their activities.   Mr. Swano has pleaded guilty to extortion and racketeeringcharges and, under a plea-bargain arrangement, is cooperatingwith federal prosecutors in their investigation of CookCounty courts.   The latest indictment follows by less than a week aconviction of another former Cook County judge, DavidShields, on bribery charges in connection with a federalsting operation.   Terence Gillespie, Mr. Maloney's attorney, said &quot;the heartof this case is Bill Swano.&quot; He said Mr. Swano went to thegovernment two days before he was indicted in June and &quot;webelieve he fabricated some information. I don't think he'sgoing to be credible.&quot;   Mr. Gillespie also said Mr. Maloney's name has been&quot;bandied around in the courtroom for two years, and wehaven't had a chance to defend ourselves. We look forward tothe opportunity to defend ourselves and we know we'll bevindicated.&quot;   Mr. Swano and Mr. McGee couldn't be reached for comment.   ---   NOTED: Denise Cote, a partner at Kaye, Scholer, Fierman,Hays andamp; Handler will become chief of the criminal division ofthe office of the U.S. attorney for the Southern District ofNew York.
