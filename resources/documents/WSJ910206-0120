Prof. Murray's facile analogiesbetween Athens and the U.S. and between Hussein's Iraq andancient Sparta lead to his encouragement of the &quot;sacrifice wemay ask a large number of young men and women to make.&quot;   Yet Sparta, not Athens, may provide closer parallels toour current situation. The Athenian Pericles exercised greatrestraint on land operations. It was Sparta, not Athens, thatundertook land warfare far from its borders and it was aSpartan king, Archidamus, who urged caution in the face ofthe unexpectedness of war in words that evoke our ownsituation:</LP><TEXT>   &quot;This, the war on which you are now debating, would be oneof the greatest magnitude. For let us never be elated by thefatal hope of the war being quickly ended by the devastationof their lands. I fear rather that we may leave it as alegacy to our children.   &quot;Not that I would bid you be so unfeeling as to sufferthem to injure your allies, and to refrain from unmaskingtheir intrigues: but I do bid you not to take up arms atonce.   &quot;For the only light in which you can view their land isthat of a hostage in your hands, a hostage that is the morevaluable the better it is cultivated. This you ought to spareas long as possible, and not make them desperate, and soincrease the difficulty of dealing with them. For if whileunprepared, hurried away by the complaints of our allies, weare induced to lay it waste, have a care that we do not bringdeep disgrace and deep perplexity upon us. Complaints,whether of communities or individuals, it is possible toadjust; but war undertaken by a coalition for sectionalinterests, whose progress there is no means of foreseeing,does not easily admit of creditable settlement.   &quot;In practice we always base our preparations against anenemy on the assumption that his plans are good; indeed, itis right to rest our hopes not on belief in his blunders, buton the soundness of our provisions. And we must not behurried into deciding a question which concerns many livesand fortunes and many cities, but we must decide calmly. Thisour strength peculiarly allows us to do. Meanwhile do notomit preparation for war. This decision will be the best foryourselves, the most terrible to your opponents.&quot;   Perhaps these are the words from Thucydides that canprovide the best guidance in our present situation. Sparta,after all, won the war, but at a cost that had not beenforeseen at its outbreak and could not easily be borne at itsconclusion.   W. Robert Conor   National Humanities Center Research   Triangle Park, N.C.   ---   Mr. Murray quotes moving words from Pericles' funeraloration, and there are indeed significant comparisons to bemade between ancient Athens and the U.S. But we should lookto the rest of Thucydides' account of the Peloponnesian War,since his admiration for Athens -- as ours should be for theU.S. -- was genuine but not blind. Consider, for example, howthe influence of war and the exercise of great powerbrutalized the Athenians to the point where they could usethese words in insisting that Melos, a small neutral island,join their alliance or be razed to the ground.   &quot;Our opinion of the gods and our knowledge of men lead usto conclude that it is a general and necessary law of natureto rule whatever one can. This is not a law that we madeourselves, nor were we the first to act upon it when it wasmade. We found it already in existence, and we shall leave itto exist for ever among those who come after us. We aremerely acting in accordance with it, and we know that you oranybody else with the same power as ours would be acting inprecisely the same way.&quot;   The Melians refused to join the alliance. After a longsiege, they surrendered to the Athenians, who killed all themen of military age and sold the women and children intoslavery.   What Mr. Murray would perhaps prefer that we not rememberin our look at how Athens resembles the U.S. is that Athenseventually lost the Peloponnesian War. The climactic passagesof Thucydides' &quot;History&quot; detail the total destruction of theAthenian army in Sicily, an unfamiliar and formidable landthe Athenians had thought was no match for theunprecedentedly great expedition they sent to conquer it.   If Thucydides' wisdom does indeed work in time of war, asyour headline would have it, let us read all of Thucydidescarefully to understand how a bold and unnecessary war canlead to disaster.
