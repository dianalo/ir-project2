(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jim and Tammy Bakker, Midwesternsweethearts from humble beginnings, built one of America's mostsuccessful television ministries, raising hundreds of millions ofdollars, only to lose it in a shot.   Now, after a nearly two-year hiatus, they are fighting to getback on the air despite a federal indictment accusing Bakker ofpocketing millions of dollars from faithful viewers.   ``These people have lost so much and they want to come back toshare what they have learned,'' said Jim Toms, a lawyer who hasrepresented Bakker since his 1987 resignation from PTL in theJessica Hahn sex-and-money scandal.   Love them or hate them, the Bakkers have one quality _ resiliency.   On Monday, Bakker and three former aides were indicted on chargesof fraud and conspiracy. Still, the couple plan to tape several TVspecials at home and hope to be on the air within a month. Bakker istrying to line up stations to carry the show.   ``I think we'll see a more introspective and cautious Jim Bakkerin his message,'' Toms said.   Toms said Bakker will plead innocent Thursday to the charges,which carry up to 120 years in prison and $6 million in fines.   Bakker and Richard Dortch, his top deputy at PTL, are accused ofdiverting more than $4 million for personal use of the $158 millionraised in ``lifetime partnerships'' from 1984 through 1987.   The Bakkers' new goals are modest compared to their successes.   In 1986, Bakker's last full year at PTL, the ministry boastedannual revenue of $129 million and employed 2,000 people. Anestimated 6 million visitors came that year to PTL's 2,300-acreHeritage USA Christian retreat near Charlotte.   Three months ago, Bakker couldn't raise a $3 million down paymentto regain control of PTL, whose assets are being auctioned offMonday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court to pay off an estimated $130 millionin debt.   In the beginning, Bakker's ambitions were humble. The youngest offour children, he was born Jan. 2, 1940, in Muskegon, Mich.   Bakker was brought up in the Assembly of God church but becameactive only after he ran over a young boy with his father's car whenhe was 18. The youngster survived, and Bakker said he wastransformed.   ``At that point, Jesus became the only thing in my life,'' hewrote in his autobiography, ``Move that Mountain.''   Bakker met Tamara Faye LaValley of International Falls, Minn., atNorth Central Bible College in Minneapolis. They married in 1961 andspent the next five years crusading.   Pat Robertson hired them in 1965 at his Christian BroadcastingNetwork. Jim and Tammy Bakker were hosts of a puppet show, andBakker later became cohost with Robertson of the ``700 Club.''   In 1974, the Bakkers moved to Charlotte and began puttingtogether PTL, which stands for Praise The Lord or People That Love.   In a short time, Bakker was preaching to overflow crowds. Viewersof the weekday talk show, ``PTL Club,'' were sending in millions ofdollars. Renamed the ``Jim and Tammy Show,'' it was carried by 1976by some 70 stations and 20 cable TV systems.   In 1978, the ministry purchased 1,100 acres in South Carolina andbuilt a $1 million satellite system, a home for handicapped childrenand a water park estimated at $10 million.   In 1986, PTL launched plans for a $1.5 billion project calledVillages of the World, including condominiums, a golf course and ahotel. In 1987, ground was broken on a 30,000-seat, $100 millionCrystal Palace.   The Bakker's spending habits have been well documented, includingstories about luxury cars, expensive homes on both coasts andshopping sprees.   Speaking about Heritage USA, Bakker once asked, ``Why should Iapologize because God throws in crystal chandeliers, mahogany floorsand the finest construction in the world?''   It all came crashing down in March 1987. The Bakkers told viewersthat Tammy was being treated for drug dependency. Two weeks later,Bakker resigned over his 1980 sexual encounter with Ms. Hahn, achurch secretary from West Babylon, N.Y.   Bakker said he had been blackmailed by ``treacherous formerfriends'' but admitted having sex with Ms. Hahn and paying her hushmoney.   Other allegations have surfaced in recent months. Former ``PTLClub'' cohost John Wesley Fletcher was quoted by Penthouse magazinelast week as saying that he was Bakker's ``male prostitute.''   While Bakker has remained silent, his wife said Thursday thatFletcher was lying. ``I've lived with that man for 27 years and Iknow he's not (bisexual),'' she told talk-show host Sally JessyRaphael.</TEXT></DOC>
