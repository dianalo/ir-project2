The formation of the new Democratic Party is an attempt tobroaden the political base of white liberals, who have sufferedrepeated setbacks in recent years.   ``The party commits itself to the establishment of a genuineSouth African democracy which rejects race as its basis, (and)protects the human dignity and liberty of all its citizens,'' saidWillem de Klerk, a leading member of the new party.   The first major test for the Democratic Party will come in thisyear's parliamentary elections, expected between late July andearly September. President P.W. Botha announced the electionThursday, but he has yet to set an exact date.   The Democratic Party will have three leaders who served as theheads of the merging parties. They are Zac de Beer of theProgressive Federal Party, Wynand Malan of the National DemocraticMovement and Denis Worrall of the Independent Party.   At a rally in Johannesburg, party leaders said they oppose allforms of apartheid, support a free enterprise economic system, andwant increased emphasis on individual rights.   The organization seeks to attract voters disillusioned withBotha's National Party and its inability to break the black-whitepolitical stalemate.   The Democratic Party indicated it wants to work closely withblacks, who have no vote in national affairs. However, theorganization made clear that it rejects the violence employedAfrican National Congress, the main black guerrilla groupattempting to undermine the government.   ``Democracy can never be built on the foundation of ... bombs,''said de Beer. ``The ANC must end the campaign of symbolic terror.''   The new party has drawn little attention from blackorganizations, many of whom see white liberals as politicallyineffective.   ``The liberal left in this country has not done much to make thegovernment change apartheid,'' said City Press, a leadingblack-oriented newspaper. ``Until such time that we're all allowedto vote, the new Democratic Party is just another white affair.''   The Progressive Federal Party had 17 of the 178 seats in thewhite chamber of Parliament, while the National Democratic Movementhad three and the Independent Party none.   Botha's National Party, which has ruled South Africa for 41years, maintains firm control of the white chamber with 133 seats.The extreme-right Conservative Party is the official oppositionwith 24 seats.   Botha announced his intention to step down after the election.   South Africa's tri-cameral Parliament has separate houses forwhites, Asians and people of mixed-race but not for the nation's28-million black majority.   White liberal parties draw their support almost exclusively fromthe major urban areas such as Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban,and they have been losing some support in recent years.   The Conservative Party overtook the Progressive Federal Party in1987 elections to become the leading opposition.   The Progressive Federal Party was formed in 1959, and one of itsfounding members, Helen Suzman, has been a member of Parliamentsince 1953. Ms. Suzman, one of the country's best-knownanti-apartheid campaigners, said she would not hold any officialposition in the Democratic Party.</TEXT></DOC>
