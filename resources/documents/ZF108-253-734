 AIX is a multi-tasking, demand-paged,virtual memory operating system, and Version 3 offers several enhancements.andO;Features include a pre-emptive kernel, a pre-emptive priority dispatcher,enhanced timer management facilities, and pre-emptive interrupt handlers withmultiple priorities.andP;  Those RT users enviously perusing this information willbe pleased to note that IBM is providing an RT Migration Assistance Programas well as a trade-in offer.andP;  For RT systems purchased between January 11989, and June 30 1990, IBM is offering trade-in credit on a one-for-onebasis to customers that want to migrate.andP;  AIX Version 3 also has a storagemanagement utility that automatically extends storage for file systems.andP;  Thestorage management utility can extend storage across fixed disk boundaries tosupport larger file systems, maintain two or three copies of mirrored fileson different disks, and automatically reallocate bad blocks.andP;  The file systemimplements database techniques when updating file system metadata to increasefile system reliability.andP;  IBM claims that this reduces recovery time bylimiting checking to the number of changed file system control structuresrather than the entire file system.andP;  Version 3 provides the System ManagementInterface Tool, an interactive system management facility.andP;  This menu-drivensystem uses system data to determine the state of the system and generatesmenu options.andP;  It facilitates the management of installation, devices,storage, security, users, communication applications, spoolers, problemdetermination, system performance and policy and system environments.andO;InfoExplorer, a hypertext database search and retrieval system, providesaccess to both text and graphic on-line documentation.andP;  The user can activatevisible hypertext links and access related or prerequisite information.andO;Users can also customise the presentation, set bookmarks, annotate thedocumentation with local site-specific information, view graphics with zoompan capabilities, print information, or copy information to files for privateuse.andP;  The Hypertext Information Base contains documentation on general usertasks, system management tasks, communication tasks and commands.andP;  It can beimplemented in a single-user workstation or a multi-user server environment.andO;The Hypertext Information Base can reside on a fixed disk or on CD-ROM.andP;  Whenshipped on CD-ROM, additional graphics files are included.andP;  From the CD-ROMHypertext Information Base, text and graphics can be viewed on graphicsdisplays, and text can be read on ASCII displays.andP;  On a graphics display, thedatabase can be accessed via AIXwindows.andP;  Use of shared libraries is enhancedby support of page mapped loading, dynamic load-time binding, and a commonlinkage convention for inter-language calling.andP;  Dynamic binding enablesprogram updating since individual modules can be added or replaced withoutrequiring the total program to be rebound or relinked.andP;  Other features on theAIX Version 3 operating system for the RS/6000 include an integrated errorlogging facility that captures error data from hardware and software in astandardised format.andP;  Errors are automatically recorded when they occur toenable analysis as part of the problem determination process.andP;  Concurrenterror notification and reporting enables background notification of multipleservices when an error is logged and enables the reporting of each error asit is logged.andP;  IBM also says that the system dump utility now includes thetraditional kernel data plus some other data.andP;  The dump can be triggered byexception and formatted in either batch or interactive mode through the crashcommand.andP;  A dump can be initiated remotely.andP;  The System Event PerformanceTrace has a menu interface for starting and stopping the trace and generatingtrace reports.andP;  Process names are printed, elapsed time is reported betweenevents, and the output is column aligned.andP;  Remote Services consists mostly ofuser interface facilities and an interface to the IBM Information Network.andO;Facilities include connection to the IBM Information Network, MaintainProfiles, Perform Problem Determination, Review System Information, andPrepare or Review Problem Descriptions.andP;  Communications and networkingsupport includes TCP/IP, X25, Network File System, and Network ComputingSystem.andP;  To price AIX Version 3, IBM has divided the RS/6000 processors intothree groups.andP;  The 7012 Powerserver and 320 Powerstation fall into E5.andP;  The7015 Powerserver 930 is in G5, and the others are in F5.andP;  Costs in E5 startat $1,250 for up to two users, and $2,500 for three or more users.andP;  In F5, itcosts $1,500 for one or two users, and $5,000 for more than three.andP;  Pricesfor systems with one or two users in the G5 category start at $2,000, whilefor between three and 32 users AIX 3 licenses for $5,000, and $10,000 formore than 32 users.andM;Applix has office automation for AIXsandM;Alis Office Automation is published and licensed by Applix Inc, and marketedthrough the Co-operative Software Program.andP;  Alis is an AIX integratedoffice-automation software system.andP;  It links multi-user minicomputers,engineering or technical workstations, and microcomputers on one network.andO;Alis integrates text, drawings, business graphics, spreadsheets, and databaseinformation, and creates links between applications to provide documentediting in native form.andP;  All referenced documents are automatically updated.andO;It supports information sharing in network-based applications, providingtransparent access to data across multi-vendor networks.andP;  It is available ina single-user version, or for one to four, eight, or 12 users.andP;  Alis on theRT costs $2,500 for the single-user version, and $3,500, $6,000, or $8,900respectively.andP;  Similarly, on the PS/2, prices range from $1,950, $3,500,$5,995 to $8,895.andP;  The MS-DOS version costs $500.andM;RS/6000 can support Xstation 120 via  Xstation Manager/6000andM;The AIX Xstation Manager/6000 licensed program supports the new Xstation 120local area network server.andP;  IBM says that the combination of the AIX XstationManager/6000 and the Xstation 120 enables use of X client-based andcharacter-based applications.andP;  Windows can be opened on the Xstation 120 byan application running on an AIX host, non-AIX hosts, and non-IBM hosts thatsupport X Window System Version 11 Release 3.andP;  Xstation 120 users may controland view multiple applications on a single screen.andP;  The AIX XstationManager/6000 costs $500, and will be available in the second quarter.andP;  -andO;Janice McGinn</TEXT></DOC>
