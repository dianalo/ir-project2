World Heritage Criteria</ITAG>The following criteria are used by the World Heritage Committee in evaluatingthe World Heritage potential of cultural and natural properties nominatedto it:A. Criteria for the Inclusion of Cultural Properties on the World HeritageList(1) A monument, group of buildings or site which is nominated for inclusionon the World Heritage List will be considered to be of outstanding universalvalue for the purposes of the Convention when the Committee finds thatit meets one or more of the following criteria and the test of authenticity.Each property nominated should therefore:(i) Represent a unique artistic achievement, a masterpiece of the creativegenius; or(ii) Have exerted great influence, over a span of time or within a culturalarea of the world, on developments in architecture, monumental arts ortown planning and landscaping; or(iii) Bear a unique or at least exceptional testimony to a civilizationwhich has disappeared; or(iv) Be an outstanding example of a type of structure which illustratesa significant stage in history; or(v) Be an outstanding example of a traditional human settlement which isrepresentative of a culture and which has become vulnerable under the impactof irreversible change; or(vi) Be directly or tangibly associated with events or with ideas or beliefsof outstanding universal significance. (The Committee considers that thiscriterion should justify inclusion in the List only in exceptional circumstancesor in conjunction with other criteria); andIn addition, the property must meet the test of authenticity in design,materials, workmanship, or setting.(2) The following additional factors will be kept in mind by the Committeein deciding on the eligibility of a cultural property for inclusion onthe List:(i) The state of preservation of the property should be evaluated relatively,that is, it should be compared with that of other property of the sametype dating from the same period, both inside and outside othe country'sborders; and(ii) Nominations of immovable property which is likely to become movablewill not be considered.(B) Criteria for the Inclusion of Natural Properties on the World HeritageList(1) A natural heritage property which is submitted for inclusion in theWorld Heritage List will be considered to be of outstanding universal valuefor the purposes of the Convention when the Committee finds that it meetsone or more of the following criteria and fulfills the conditions of integrityset out below. Properties nominated should therefore:(i) Be outstanding examples representing the major stages of the earth'sevolutionary history; or(ii) Be outstanding examples representing significant ongoing geologicalprocesses, biological evolution, and man's interaction with his naturalenvironment; as distinct from the periods of the earth's development, thisfocuses upon ongoing processes in the development of communities of plantsand animals, landforms, and marine areas and fresh water bodies; or(iii) Contain superlative natural phenomena, formations or features, forinstance, outstanding examples of the most important ecosystems, areasof exceptional natural beauty or exceptional combinations of natural andcultural elements; or(iv) Contain the foremost natural habitats where threatened species ofanimals or plants of outstanding universal value from the point of viewof science or conservation still survive.(2) In addition to the above criteria, the sites should also fulfill theconditions of integrity:(i) The sites described in (i) above should contain all or most of thekey interrelated and interdependent elements in their natural relationships;for example, an ``ice age'' area would be expected to include the snowfield, the glacier itself, and samples of cutting patterns, deposition,and colonization (striations, moraines, pioneer stages of plant succession,etc.).(ii) The sites described in (ii) above should have sufficient size andcontain the necessary elements to demonstrate the key aspects of the processand to be self-perpetuating. For example, an area of ``tropical rain forest''may be expected to include some variation in elevation above sea level,changes in topography and soil types, river banks or oxbow lakes, to demonstratethe diversity and complexity of the system.(iii) The sites described in (iii) above should contain those ecosystemcomponents required for the continuity of the species or of the other naturalelements or processes/objects to be conserved. This will vary accordingto individual cases; for example, the protected area of a waterfall wouldinclude all, or as much as possible, of the supporting upstream watershed;or a coral reef area would include the zone necessary to control siltationor pollution through the stream flow or ocean currents which provide itsnutrients.(iv) The sites containing threatened species as described in (iv) aboveshould be of sufficient size and contain necessary habitat requirementsfor the survival of the species.(v) In the case of migratory species, seasonal sites necessary for theirsurvival, wherever they are located, should be adequately protected. TheCommittee must receive assurances that the necessary measures be takento ensure that the species are adequately protected throughout their fulllife cycle. Agreements made in this connection, either through adherenceto international conventions or in the form of other multilateral or bilateralarrangements, would provide this assurance.(3) The property should be evaluated relatively, that is, it should becompared with other properties of the same type, both inside and outsidethe country's borders, within a biogeographic province, or migratory pattern.<ITAG tagnum="84">III.
