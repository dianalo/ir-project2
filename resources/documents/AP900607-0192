Samuel Zambrana, 61 with seven children, said he was going alongwith the plan, but ``I have no income now and I cannot get my bananaand orange crop out because of bad roads. If the government is goingto take coca away from us, we need profitable alternative crops,good roads and a market.''   Since Dec. 1, farmers have destroyed a record 4,500 hectares ofcoca, more than one-tenth of the 38,250 devoted to growing the cropfrom which cocaine is made, according to U.S. government figures. Ahectare is about 2{ acres.   ``We continue to be very pleased with voluntary eradicationprograms and the commitment which the Bolivian government continuesto demonstrate,'' the U.S. Embassy said.   Tens of thousands of farmers have left the Chapare coca-producingregion because of a sharp drop in prices for the leaf. Farmersreceive $2,000 from the Bolivian government for every hectaredestroyed.   Voluntary eradication was spurred late last year, when Colombia'sdrug war and increased interdiction in Bolivia disrupted cocaineproduction and reduced the demand for coca leaves.   A 100-pound sack of coca costs about $30 to produce and broughtonly $10 at the beginning of May, compared with $100 five years ago,but had risen to about $20 by the end of the month. The increasecaused concern that cocaine processing operations were resuming inColombia.   Nearly one-third of the world's coca leaves are produced in theChapare, a lush, tropical region in the heart of Bolivia.   At least 300,000 farmers depend on coca cultivation and cocaineproduction for a livelihood. The government says the industry bringsabout $600 million a year into the economy.   Leaves of the coca bush, which resemble bay leaves, are harvestedfour times a year, dried and then macerated into paste with kerosenein plastic-covered pits. The paste is refined into cocaine in labsin the Bolivian lowlands, Colombia and Brazil.   Bolivia, which has a population of 7.1 million, is SouthAmerica's poorest country and its largest recipient of U.S. aid.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, June 17</NOTE></DOC>
