Revenue rose 16%, to 1.94 billion dollars ($937.9 million) from 1.67 billion dollars.    MORGAN GUARANTY LTD. said it has been approached about a possible purchase of HILL SAMUEL GROUP PLC'S Wood Mackenzie stockbrokerage unit. Officials at the U.S. investment bank and the British merchant bank said it was too early to say whether the approach would lead to negotiations. Hill Samuel is understood to have discussed the sale of the unit with as many as a dozen firms since it announced its agreement last month to be bought by TSB Group PLC, a British retail bank, in an acquisition valued at #777 million ($1.38 billion). </TEXT></DOC>
