GMF, a joint venture between Detroit-based General Motors Corp. and Fanuc Ltd. of Japan, said the agreement is for six years. It wouldn't place a value on the pact.    A GMF spokesman said the agreement represents a big step in efforts to diversify beyond the automotive industry. The company said the Champion division, DeVilbiss Co. of Toledo, Ohio, has strength in the nonauto market. GMF will continue to sell robots to the auto sector. </TEXT></DOC>
