Sen. William Keating, the bill's sponsor, hopes to inoculateMassachusetts hospitals, universities and businesses againstso-called computer viruses with legislation that would create a newcategory of crime analagous to breaking into a building.   ``It's an attempt to put on the statutes a law that wouldpenalize people for destruction or deliberate modification orinterference with computer properties,'' Keating said Friday. ``Itclarifies the criminal nature of the wrongdoing and, I think, inthat sense serves as a deterrent and makes clear that this kind ofbehavior is criminal activity.''   The idea for the bill came from a constituent, Elissa Royal, whohas a background in hospital administration and became concernedabout the security of patient files.   ``I heard about (computer) viruses on the news,'' she said. ``Myfirst thought was the clinical pathology program. Our doctors wouldlook at it and make all these decisions without looking at the hardcopy.   ``I thought, what if some malevolent, bright little hacker gotinto the system and changed the information? How many people wouldbe injured or die?''   Last November, a Cornell graduate student, Robert T. Morris Jr.,clogged thousands of computers around the country by unleashing aset of instructions into Internet, a widely used computer network.   Keating and experts in the field believe that many cases ofcomputer viruses go unreported. Often victims file no complaintsbecause they do not want to attract publicity, or because theybelieve prosecutors do not have the laws they need to press charges.   Under Keating's bill, penalties would increase depending onwhether the attacker merely entered a computer, interfered with itsoperations or destroyed data. In the most serious case, any personfound guilty of knowingly releasing a computer virus would besubject to a maximum of 10 years in prison or $25,000 fine.   The bill is pending in committee, as staff members are refiningits language to carefully define the term ``virus.''</TEXT></DOC>
