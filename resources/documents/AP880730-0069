However, the Conservative leader also said Britain should makeno concessions for release of hostages.   She made the comments in a letter to David Waite, dated July 27.It was released by Lambeth Palace in London, the headquarters ofArchbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie.   The Church of England leader sent Terry Waite to Lebanon to seekrelease of American hostages held there, but the Anglican envoydisappeared Jan. 20, 1987. He is believed held by pro-IranianShiite extremists.   In her letter, the prime minister welcomed Iran's July 18decision to accept a cease-fire in its 8-year-old war with Iraq.   She added: ``I hope that we can now work together to remove theobstacles to a better relationship.''   Britain has limited diplomatic relations with Tehran, with noBritish diplomats stationed in the Iranian capital.   ``Hostage-taking is a crime and anyone with influence overhostage-takers should use this to help secure their release,'' shesaid. ``If the Iranian government is in a position to exertinfluence towards this humanitarian objective, we look to it to doso.''   The prime minister added: ``I know you agree that the governmentshould not make concessions to secure the release of hostages, andI respect your view all the more against the background of distresswhich you and your family continue to suffer.''   David Waite said he welcomed the letter. He said Saturday onbehalf of the Waite family: ``Of course there are problems to besolved between Britain and Iran. But Mrs. Thatcher's assurance thatgood will will be reciprocated is very good news.''   Kidnappers are believed to hold 18 Westerners, including 9Americans, hostage in Lebanon. The longest held is Terry Anderson,chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press, who waskidnapped March 16, 1985.
