Theobold, chairman of Chicago-based ContinentalBank, a major industry lender. ``As a lender to your industry, wecan only predict volatility.''   Theobold, representing the financial sector Monday on a panelkicking off the week-long conference, said oil companies must buildin more economic flexibility.   ``I know it isn't a lot of fun but we might as well admit it'shappening,'' he said.   Joining him on the keynote panel were H. Laurance Fuller,president of Amoco Corp. of Chicago; Jose Napoleon Lista, viceminister of energy and mines for Venezuela; and John C. Crosbie,Canadian minister for international trade.   The conference is primarily a technical gathering of some 25,000engineers and executives involved in offshore oil and gasexploration and production. More than 15,000 people attended Monday.   Lista, the panel's representative of the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries by virtue of his country's membershipin the cartel, said OPEC countries are concerned about the recentsharp increases in the price of oil.   He complained that the energy consuming countries too often viewOPEC members as ``wearing black hats,'' noting that the OPECcharter allowed members to receive a fair return on their oil.   ``Maybe we can wear the white hats, too,'' he said. ``None ofthe happenings that have caused this (jump in oil prices) is underthe control of OPEC.   ``There's nothing we can do about the spill,'' he said,referring to the recent oil spill in Alaska. ``There's nothing wecan do about the excessive use of gasoline in Europe and the UnitedStates.   ``If the OPEC countries are allowed by the rest of the world,OPEC will keep the rest of the world supplied with oil. We want theconsuming countries to benefit as much as producing countries fromthe resource nature has given us.''   Although Lista said he thought OPEC would keep prices at a level``where everyone will be happy,'' Fuller said there are indicationsseveral members of the cartel will push for higher productionquotas when the current $18 per-barrel price agreement expireslater this summer.   ``The underlying facts of the world supply and demand argueagainst a strong price recovery,'' he said. ``In general, theindustry outlook is restrained.''   Crosbie said he hoped Canada would be viewed as an attractiveplace for investment and that the country's oil and gas industryshowed great promise, but he downplayed the significance of energyprice forecasts.   He noted that when forecasts in the early 1980s pointed to$65-per-barrel oil, he and his party backed a 30-cent-per-gallongasoline tax that Canadian voters found abhorrent.   The unpopular stance was reflected in the party's lack ofsuccess in the next election, Crosbie said.   Fuller said Amoco sees the possibility that the domestic oil rigcount, 751 as of Monday, could double within five years.   ``While an improvement, this increase is not enough to reversedomestic production decline,'' he said.   While oil companies cannot control prices, Fuller said, they canaddress their own costs.</TEXT></DOC>
