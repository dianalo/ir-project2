(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Immigration officials say they are justfollowing guidelines in trying to deport the children of twoMexican nationals who have worked in the United States for yearsand may receive amnesty.   The children, aged 10 and 11, have no place to go if they aresent back to Mexico because their grandmother, with whom they usedto stay, has moved across the border to Yuma, relatives say.   Ruth Anne Myers, district director the Immigration andNaturalization Service, said one parent can also return to Mexicoif deportation is ordered.   The family says it won't split up, even if it means both parentshave to return to Mexico and forfeit their chance at legalization.   Enrique Garcia-Guiverra and Francesca Guadarrama-Fuentes holdINS-approved jobs in Tucson and are waiting for decision on whetherthey worked in the fields for long enough to qualify for theamnesty program that was signed into law in November 1986.   Their children, Israel and Francisco Javier Garcia-Guadarrrama,lived with their grandmother in San Luis Rio Colorado at first butjoined them in the United States in June 1987.   In January, when the family was stopped near Yuma, problemsarose.   Border Patrol officers tried to deport the children on the spot,but agreed to permit a hearing after the parents protested,according to lawyers.   The parents then turned to Southern Arizona Legal Aid, and legalaid lawyers asked INS to grant the children an exemption under aFamily Fairness program designed to keep families together.   But INS officials said the children did not qualify because theyweren't in the United States before November 1986. Instead, theyasked a hearing officer for immediate deportation.   The November 1986 cutoff is arbitrary, legal aid attorney NadineWettstein said. ``They have to draw a line someplace and it justhappens that it's on top of these kids heads,'' she says.   ``These were guidelines that came from Washington,'' Ms. Myerssaid. ``It was a national policy that was accepted or adopted bythe commissioner of naturalization and immigration.''   The parents entered the country illegally in the first place,and even if they can now benefit from amnesty, there's no reason toextend that benefit to the children, Ms. Myers added.   ``We've always worked hard,'' Garcia-Guiverra said Monday, withMs. Wettstein as translator from Spanish. ``We're not a problem forthe government.''   Although INS is pressing for a decision from the hearingofficer, Ms. Myers said Monday it might be willing to hold off ondeportation even if the hearing officer authorizes it.   ``That type of discretionary authority is there,'' she says.   The statement comes as a surprise to Ms. Wettstein, who says INShas already refused several proposals to put the issue on hold.</TEXT></DOC>
