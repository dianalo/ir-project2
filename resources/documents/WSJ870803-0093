And it does appear gloomy. Companies are still trimming management layers and hiring cautiously in the face of a possible recession. In the second quarter, demand for executives was down 7% from the first quarter and from a year earlier, according to the Association of Executive Search Consultants Inc., a trade group.    Still, there are pockets of demand. Trouble-shooters are being recruited by ailing companies in Texas and in other states hurt by the oil-industry slump. Financial companies are turning to people who can help them expand services. Utilities are looking outside the industry for executives with a more competitive, even entrepreneurial, bent. And across the board, upper-level job seekers are faring better than those in middle management.    Here's a look at some of the opportunities and risks that executives may find in the job market today, particularly in certain industries and regions where there has been much change.    INDUSTRIES   FINANCIAL SERVICES: The financial-services industry is still hot, despite signs of overstaffing in some areas. &quot;Last year was strong but this year is stronger,&quot; says Putney Westerfield, president of Boyden International Inc., a New York search firm. Korn/Ferry International, a Los Angeles-based search firm, says 32% of its business is in financial services this year, up from 22% in 1986. Most of that demand is for upper-level executives. The booming stock market and the proliferation of new financial products is continuing to fuel demand for people with experience in capital markets, in mortgage-backed securities and in fixed-income portfolio management. Demand also is growing for private bankers, Mr. Westerfield says, as more and more financial institutions begin personalized services for high-income individuals. In the securities industry, U.S. companies have increased their hiring for executive jobs overseas. &quot;The Big Bang (deregulation) in London accelerated the globalization of financial markets,&quot; says Dayton Ogden, managing director of the search firm Spencer Stuart in New York. &quot;There's enormous demand for people who can function comfortably in Tokyo, New York and London.&quot; The picture isn't all rosy, though. Some employers are wary of considering job candidates from companies linked to the recent insider-trading scandals. &quot;It runs all the way from companies saying they won't look at candidates from certain firms, to having potential employees sign statements saying they haven't been involved in illegal activities,&quot; says Windle Priem, managing director for financial services at Korn/Ferry. Moreover, some search firms believe the big investment banking companies are overstaffed and will cut back soon. Hiring already has tapered off at some. &quot;We aren't expanding our head count as rapidly as we have in periods in the past,&quot; says Herbert M. Allison, director of human resource management at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., which earlier this year had a trading loss of $377 million, mainly in mortgage-backed securities. &quot;I'd say we were the leader in diversifying, and we're one of the first to refocus on our core business. Other firms are experiencing the same trends we are.&quot;    UTILITIES: Hiring at gas and electric utilities has increased, especially as deregulation has made the industry more competitive. &quot;We're competing now,&quot; says George Weida, vice president of human resources for San Diego Gas andamp; Electric Co. &quot;Historically, a competitive, entrepreneurial aggressive approach to customers hasn't been present in utilities.&quot; Utilities are going outside the industry to find executives from more competitive fields. At San Diego Gas andamp; Electric, for instance, five of the most recent vice presidential jobs were given to executives hired from outside the company; four of those were from outside the industry. At utilities in the past, Mr. Weida says, &quot;Promotion from within was not only a trend, it was almost the law.&quot;    TECHNOLOGY: Technology companies are hiring again, as the industry begins a modest rebound. &quot;We are seeing a resurgence in high-technology assignments, which went into the tank for a while,&quot; says Mr. Ogden, of the Spencer Stuart search firm.    In particular, growing companies are looking for new marketing vice presidents and chief financial officers, says Bruce Dingman, of the search firm Robert W. Dingman andamp; Co., Westlake Village, Calif.    Louis A. Hoyda, a principal at Thorndike Deland Associates Inc., a search firm in New York, also says demand for marketing executives has increased in the technology field. Mr. Hoyda says a New England firm that develops information-processing devices recently asked him to find the company an executive vice president for marketing. A search for that type of executive wouldn't have been requested by a technology company a year ago, Mr. Hoyda says.    AIRLINES: The troubles at Allegis Corp., the parent of United Airlines, apparently have sent some of the company's executives looking for work elsewhere. But, like other former airline officials over the past year, they are finding that there aren't many jobs available in the industry, which recently has been one of the most volatile for executive job changes.    Barbara Provus, a principal with Sweeney Shepherd, a Chicago-based search firm, says she's received phone calls from senior Allegis executives worried that the company's plans to break up its transportation conglomerate will cost them their jobs. &quot;They are aggressively looking for jobs while the jury is still out&quot; on how Allegis's restructuring will affect them, Ms. Provus says.    Deregulation and consolidation have sharply cut executive jobs in the industry. AirCal, a regional carrier in California, for example, was merged into American Airlines in July. &quot;Our officers are now their officers,&quot; an American Airlines spokesman says. The former president of AirCal has become vice president, international, for American. &quot;That's one less position for a president of an airline,&quot; says Mr. Dingman.    REGIONS   Look at housing demand, and there you'll find executive demand, says Robert Simon, vice president of Deane, Howard andamp; Simon Inc., a search firm based in Hartford, Conn. Not surprisingly, Mr. Simon has found that the demand is greatest in the Northeastern corridor and parts of California, where the economy is booming and a modest two-story frame house can cost more than $250,000. Overall, demand is lowest in the oil-producing states and other depressed areas, where &quot;For Sale&quot; signs still sprout like mushrooms after a rain.    But even where the economy is lagging, recruiters are noticing spots of demand for executives. In the oil-producing states, for instance, companies are looking for executive trouble-shooters, able to help companies emerge from bankruptcy, restore profitability, and salvage bad loans, says Tom Hayman, president of Dallas-based Hayman andamp; Co., a search firm. The jobs that are available, however, can be daunting. Mr. Hayman says he recently had to find a chief executive to run a savings and loan association that had a billion dollars in assets and, because of loan problems in the Southwest, a negative net worth.    Although $20-a-barrel crude hasn't revived the U.S. oil industry, demand for executives is firming in other industries in the Southwest, some recruiters say. Overall, &quot;the business in the area seems to be less desperate than it was a year-and-a-half ago,&quot; says Mr. Simon.    Recruiters also are beginning to see glimmers of a resurgence in the industrial Midwest. &quot;Manufacturing companies are moving out of a six- or seven-year period of retrenchment,&quot; Mr. Westerfield says, and that means increasing demand for &quot;growth-minded executives and line managers.&quot; In the second quarter, demand for executives in the Midwest rose 7.26% from a year earlier.    FOREIGN COMPANIES   Foreign companies are wooing executives, but not for jobs abroad.    &quot;There's a dramatic increase in foreign companies coming here to invest, which will continue to create opportunities,&quot; says Paul Ray Jr., president and chief executive officer of Paul R. Ray andamp; Co., a New York-based search firm. Foreign direct investment in the U.S. grew 13% last year.    As a foreign company's U.S. operations grow, a different type of manager is required. &quot;The kind of person you need to run a $2 million to $3 million company might be totally unsuitable to a bigger one,&quot; says Donald J. Polak, who was hired earlier this year as president of Pelikan Inc., the Franklin, Tenn.-based unit of Pelikan International, a Swiss concern. The unit, which makes computer-printer ribbons, grew from &quot;virtually nothing&quot; to a $50 million annual business in ten years, he says. Mr. Polak came to Pelikan from Hunt Manufacturing Co. of Philadelphia.    &quot;To an increasing degree, people from various countries are realizing that this is a market they don't know that much about, so they'd better have an experienced, welltrained executive,&quot; says Stephen McPherson, an official at Ward Howell International Inc., a New York-based executive-recruiting firm.    JOB LEVEL   Demand may have improved for upperlevel executives, but hiring in middle-management is languishing.    According to the Association of Executive Search Consultants, demand for executives earning less than $60,000 -- generally considered middle management -- has fallen by half since 1983. What's more, many recruiters believe that demand for middle managers may never pick up again. &quot;Middle management, and particularly staff middle management, is a thing of the past,&quot; says Mr. Simon.    Largely because of cutbacks, middle management will account for 9% of all jobs by the year 2000, down from 10.4% currently, predicts economist Richard Belous of the Conference Board, a business-research group.    Demand has increased, however, for executives at levels just above middle management, such as marketing vice presidents, chief financial officers, vice presidents of sales, and heads of divisions. The Association of Executive Search Consultants says these executives are in twice as much demand now as they were in 1983.    JOB EXPERIENCE   Increasingly, companies are looking for executives who know the nuts and bolts of the operation, rather than those who built their careers in staff positions.    &quot;A couple of years ago, it seemed that everyone was looking for managers of strategic planning,&quot; says Ms. Provus. &quot;That was the hot button.&quot; Now, she says, even for staff positions such as marketing, public relations and employee relations, companies want people who actually have been responsible for making or selling a product.    &quot;People are going to have to bring a greater skill set in their toolbox to go into a staff position,&quot; says Walter Ince, a personnel official at Tektronix Inc., a Beaverton, Ore.-based maker of precision measurement equipment. The executive who has made a career solely in the staff side may even be becoming obsolete. &quot;One of the biggest dilemmas for a staff person,&quot; Ms. Provus says, &quot;is how to get out of a staff role&quot; so that the employee can get operating experience as well.    Executives from the operations side have an even greater edge over their staff counterparts as companies focus more on cutting costs. &quot;Companies are trying to create the most efficient organizations they can,&quot; says Robert M. Montgomery, managing partner of Christensen andamp; Montgomery, a Chatham, N.J., search firm. To do that, they turn to people with operating experience who can better plan for streamlining and cost cutting. &quot;If we look back three to five years, the demand was for people who could deal with growth.&quot;    Putting someone with operating experience into a staff job, however, isn't always easy. Tektronix would like some of its employees with sales experience to work in its marketing staff, for example. But the company has found that the sales representatives, who receive salaries and commissions, typically earn far more than they would be paid in the marketing jobs.    Attitudes also may need adjusting for such job switches to succeed. Ms. Provus recalls an operations line manager who balked at being named head of public relations for a multibillion-dollar company. &quot;He thought staff positions were nothing but bull.&quot;    ---                     Executive Employment                       What the Jobs Are                                        1987        1986    Financial    (banking/insurance/brokerage         32%         22%    High technology                      13%         14%    Public sector/not-for-profit         11%         15%    Health services/pharmaceutical       10%         12%    Manufacturing                         8%          6%    Merchandising/retail                  8%          6%    Consumer products                     6%          6%    Hospitality/leisure/entertainment     5%          6%    Energy/petroleum/chemical             3%          3%    Real estate/building/construction     3%          6%    Other                                 1%          2%   Source: Korn/Ferry International</TEXT></DOC>
