<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-11-0575 </DOCNO><TEXT>A method of continuous solvent fractionation of coke oven tar to makean insoluble pitch and oil fraction has been demonstrated. The distillationresidue of the oil fraction (oil pitch) can be further processed to givehigh-quality electrode coke, carbon fibre precursor, composite-impregnatingpitch or components for tar/resin paints. The insoluble pitch gives pitchcoke suitable for anode manufacture. Thermal treatment of mixtures ofthe insoluble pitch and the oil pitch facilitates the production of awide range of electrode binders and impregnating pitches. 13 refs., 2figs., 6 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
