Sharon's comments in an interview with Israel radio reflected ``apersonal opinion that Arafat should be killed,'' his spokesman,Moshe Behagon, told The Associated Press. ``He says many times thatif it were possible, he would want to kill him.''   Also Saturday, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said U.S. officialssupport his peace plan that includes elections in the occupiedterritories in exchange for a cease-fire in the Palestinan uprising,Israel television reported.   One Palestinian protester was reported fatally shot in theterritories Saturday. Arab news reports said at least 10 people,including a boy, either were shot and wounded or beaten in clashesbetween soldiers and stone-throwers in the occupied West Bank andGaza Strip.   The army confirmed four woundings by plastic bullets.   The death raised to 370 the number of Palestinians killed in thenearly 14-month-old uprising. Fifteen Israelis also have died.   Sharon's remarks come amid growing debate over the nation'spolicy toward the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel'sresponse to the 13-month Palestinian uprising in the occupiedterritories.   ``As long as Arafat runs around alive around us, there will neverbe peace,'' Sharon said. ``No Arab leader will be ready to meet withus for fear for his life. And no Palestinian will be ready to talkbecause if he does so while Arafat is alive, his fate is sealed.''   Sharon seemed to be alluding to repeated threats from leaders ofthe PLO-supported uprising against Palestinians who cooperate withthe Israelis. More than a dozen alleged collaborators have beenkilled during the uprising.   Once the nation's defense minister, Sharon was forced from thepost in 1983 after Israel's militia allies in Lebanon massacredPalestinians in Beirut.   Israel denounces the PLO as terrorists and refuses to talk withit. The nation protested bitterly when the United States openedtalks with the PLO last month. But there are growing calls forIsrael to change its policy.   Rabin, a leader of the Labor party, said he has won support fromleading U.S. officials for a peace plan he published last week thatoffers elections in the territories in exchange for a cease-fire inthe uprising, Israel television reported.   The plan has been rejected by both the PLO and undergroundleaders of the uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.   But the television quoted Rabin as telling a reporter that U.S.officials have indicated that the plan was a ``possible basis'' fora settlement to the Palestinian issue.   However, Sharon said: ``Any attempt in or out of the governmentthat tries to explain why we should speak to the PLO, only paves theway for and lends legitimacy to other governments to talk toArafat.''   Arafat began his latest peace initiative in December when he saidthe PLO renounced terrorism and recognized Israel. Last week hetraveled to Spain, where he was received for the first time byWestern European leaders.   Israel radio said a 23-year-old died after troops shot him in aWest Bank village near Bethlehem. The army confirmed the death butsaid it was investigating the circumstances and gave no otherdetails.   Two other Palestinians were wounded in the same clash in thevillage of Sureif, while two others were wounded in a village nearthe West Bank city of Nablus, the army said.   Two Palestinian teen-agers from the Balata refugee camp nearNablus were also treated for beating injuries to the face, said thereports and an official at Al Ittihad Hospital in Nablus.   At least four other woundings occurred in Gaza, Arab news reportssaid. The army confirmed three, including that of a 3-year-old boy,from plastic bullets fired at stone-throwing protesters.</TEXT></DOC>
