Employees of the department's land-management agencies _ theNational Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, the Bureau ofIndian Affairs, the Bureau of Reclamation and the Fish and WildlifeService _ will be given increased training in spotting signs ofdrug use, Hodel said.   He used the example of a bottle cap ``which you or I might notthink anything of,'' but which might have been used to heat a smallamount of a drug solution, and ``to a trained ranger might alerthim that something was going on in the vicinity.''   Departmental pilots may be asked to keep an eye out formarijuana stands, he said.   The department has sent public service commercials asking forpublic alertness to drug use and transactions to 600 televisionstations, and new signs will be added at parks and otherfacilities, Hodel said.   The department administers 500 million acres of land, ore than afifth of the nation. If the Forest Service, an AgricultureDepartment office that like the Interior Department has encounteredmarijuana growing on its lands, were added, the total would beabout 30 percent of the nation.   The department's domains include tracts from parks in and nearWashington, D.C., where drugs like crack and PCP are frequentlytraded, all the way to some of the most remote areas of the nation,like vast tracts of Alaska, where drug activities are unlikely tobe a concern.   Though the department wants park rangers to be more alert, ``Idon't read (them) as going out of their way'' to raid visitorcampsites looking for drugs, Hodel said.   Instead, ``The rangers would be the eyes and ears'' for lawenforcement officers.   The secretary said subordinates had developed an estimate thatthe department spends $11 million a year on anti-drug activites byits 4,300 law enforcement officers and 30 undercover agents, though``I am always nervous about such figures.''   He said he could offer only ``anecdotal evidence'' that drug useand sales on the public lands were getting worse, but noted thatthe National Park Service alone made 3,100 drug arrests last yearand confiscated an estimated $1 billion worth of illegal drugs,including 110,000 marijuana plants.   Department bureaus have been asked to give priority to drugs indrawing up their budget requests for the 1990 fiscal year, andHodel said he would support increases ``If that's what it takes.''</TEXT></DOC>
