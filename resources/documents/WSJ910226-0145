Accusations fly fast and free between the partnershipsponsors and the &quot;secondary-market&quot; firms that buypartnership units or bring sellers and buyers together.</LP><TEXT>   But both sides generally agree on one thing: Sellers oftenreceive considerably less than their units are really worth.   Lots of partnership investors have good reason for beingdisappointed. Back in the late 1970s and the first half ofthe 1980s, they poured billion of dollars into partnershipsthat invested in everything from office buildings to oilwells to high-technology equipment. But many partnershipsperformed poorly, and tax-law changes clobbered those thatwere designed as &quot;shelters.&quot;   Whether investors really want to sell may be anothermatter, however. As the dispute about pricing suggests,venturing into the secondary market has its pitfalls.   Here's a primer for people who are thinking about selling-- or just want to know what the market can tell them aboutthe value of their partnership holdings.                                                                                                          Just what is the secondary market?   If the word &quot;market&quot; calls up images of the New York StockExchange, forget it. The resale market for partnership units&quot;is more like a baseball-card swap meet than an organizedmarket,&quot; says Paul Williams, alternative investment directorat G.K. Scott andamp; Co, Boca Raton, Fla.   There are perhaps 20 securities firms, mostly small insize, that either help buyers and sellers link up or that buyand sell units themselves. In addition, most of the majorretail brokerage firms will try to match sellers and newbuyers of partnership units those firms had originallymarketed.                                                                                                          How active is the trading?   Not very. Probably no more than 300 of the roughly 3,500publicly registered partnerships are traded actively --meaning at least once a week -- according to Robert A.Stanger, whose Shrewsbury, N.J., firm tracks partnershipactivity.   Mr. Stanger offers a rough estimate that $250 million ofpartnership units change hands each year at the independentfirms and the big brokerage houses. That's less than 1% ofthe $78 billion investors originally paid for those programs,he notes. (It's also equivalent, in dollar terms, to about 19minutes of stock trading on the Big Board.)                                                                                                          Are sellers really getting significantly less than theirholdings are worth?   Most market participants and observers think so, but it'simpossible to know. The alternative view is that many ofthese programs are simply worth less than the sponsors andinvestors have believed.   Resale prices for most partnerships are clearly far belowthe prices at which partnership units were initially sold.For instance, The Wall Street Journal's survey of trades inthe fourth quarter of 1990 found sellers getting around 53cents for each dollar they had originally invested in somewidely held partnerships.   But comparing resale prices to original cost doesn't sayvery much. Some partnerships have already returned some ofthe investors' capital, which means the resale prices aren'tas bad as they look.   The more significant question is what the real estate orother assets held by the partnerships are worth today. Withthe real-estate market in a bad slump, many properties areclearly worth much less than a few years ago.   Unfortunately, those numbers are hard to come by. Only 25%to 30% of real estate sponsors provide information on theappraised value of their partnerships' assets, Mr. Stangersays. Observers sometimes criticize sponsors' numbers asoverly rosy. Meanwhile, other information is scarce.   James Frith Jr., president of Chicago Partnership BoardInc., believes discounts to underlying value range from 10%to 60%, with the average perhaps 35%.   Because of discounts, the average investor &quot;will get moremoney by holding onto the unit and letting it liquidate overtime,&quot; says Richard G. Wollack, chairman of Liquidity FundInvestment Corp., the Emeryville, Calif., firm that is widelyviewed as the largest player in the secondary market.                                                                                                          If there are indeed big discounts, why?   Executives in the secondary market say there are logicalreasons. The key one: Given the complexity and poorperformance of many partnerships, there is only a limitednumber of potential buyers. &quot;There are too few buyers in thesecondary market and they've really got it their way,&quot; saysJon Hale of Hale Financial Inc., a Sarasota, Fla., firm thatrepresent sellers.   In addition, between the seller and the buyer, there is atleast one intermediary taking a cut. That's reflected in theJournal survey, where the representative prices paid bybuyers in the fourth quarter averaged 15% higher than therepresentative prices received by sellers. (The Journal tableshows the proceeds sellers actually received, after anycommissions were subtracted. In some cases the prices paid bybuyers are understated; there may be additional commissionsor mark-ups not included.)                                                                                                          Who exactly are the sellers and the buyers?   Many people who would like to dump their partnerships andinvest elsewhere are turned off by the prices in thesecondary market. So most sales are forced by seriousfinancial woes, divorce or death. &quot;We rarely ever buy fromsomeone who is still alive,&quot; says Mr. Williams of G.K. Scott.   Buyers include investors who bought units of the sameprograms at higher prices in the initial offering. Inaddition, Liquidity Fund and some other secondary-marketfirms raise money from affluent individuals to invest indiversified pools of partnership interests.                                                                                                          Do some partnerships command better prices or sell moreeasily?   Absolutely, say the secondary-market firms. What mostbuyers want is a steady stream of quarterly distributions.And what they don't want is to place a bet on the batteredreal-estate market turning up.   That means decent demand and small discounts for all-cashreal estate partnerships throwing off a lot of rental income.And it means limited demand and steep discounts for highlyleveraged real-estate programs that deliver little or nocurrent income because of their heavy debt. Investors holdingprograms that have had lousy results may not get any bids.   Meanwhile, the size of distributions largely determinesthe prices offered for income-generating programs. Buyers aregenerally looking to get a 10% yield -- that is, annualdistributions equal to 10% of their purchase price --secondary-market firms say.   Buyers need to exercise extreme caution in valuingprograms based on recent distributions. Those payouts are noindication of future distributions and may be inflated byone-time payments or returns of capital.                                                                                                          How can a person who must sell get the best pricepossible?   Seek bids from many secondary-market firms because theycan vary enormously. For instance, Mr. Hale, who gets paid todo that legwork for sellers, recently sought bids on units ofFirst Capital Income Properties Ltd. -- Series IX, a programin the Journal survey. In a single day, he received fivequotes ranging from $375 to $575 per $1,000 unit.   Investors should also be sure to check with the person orfirm that sold them the partnership units initially,particularly in the case of a major retail securities firmthat sponsors its own programs. The most active trading inthose partnerships generally occurs internally. And in-houseprices in some cases may be higher.   For instance, documents filed by Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. showthat units of its MLH Income Realty Partnership V changedhands at prices ranging from $580 to $862 per $1,000 unit inthe six months ended last September. In the two Journalsurveys covering that period, outside secondary-market firmsreported prices ranging from $377 to $675.   ---  Secondary-Market Prices of Some Widely Held Partnerships                                                                                                          Real Estate/Equity@                                                                                                                                                                                                               PARTNERSHIP: Angeles Income Properties Ltd.
