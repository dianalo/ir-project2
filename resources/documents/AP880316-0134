The Kremlin's apparent willingness to extract its estimated115,000 troops may signal a broader policy change in thesuperpower's role in foreign revolutions.   Should an acceptable retreat be found from Afghanistan and theconflict between pro- and anti-Communist forces be left to theAfghans, Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev would heal one of hisnation's most visible foreign policy sores. He also could improverelations with the United States, China, the Indian subcontinentand the Moslem world.   Perhaps most importantly, some observers suggest, the Kremlinmight be rethinking its role in promoting socialist revolution innations such as Nicaragua and Angola, where Soviet aid bolstersgovernment forces against tenacious opposition.   The Afghan revolution is the only struggle in which the SovietUnion acknowledges its troops are fighting.   Since the Kremlin announced last year that it had taken the``political decision'' to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan, thestate-run media and officials have hinted that policies that led tothe Dec. 27, 1979, intervention are under close scrutiny.   Oleg T. Bogomolov, a leading economist who heads the Instituteof Economics of the World Socialist System, said in a letterpublished Wednesday that he warned the Kremlin less than a monthafter the intervention that sending Soviet soldiers to Afghanistandamaged relations with the United States, China and Moslem nations.   While Marxist doctrine forecasts the spread of socialistrevolution worldwide, Gorbachev has made it clear that his firstpriority is getting his own nation's economy on its feet.   The government has indicated it will fulfill its contractualagreements, even in Afghanistan.   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov told reportersTuesday that military aid to Afghanistan was not subject tonegotiation in Geneva because it was part of longstandingcooperation with Kabul.   However, some American Sovietologists and veteran foreign policyexperts see in the military withdrawal the possible emergence of apolicy of improving relations with other nations and directingresources to domestic needs.   ``I see them moving toward a different approach to regionalconflict,'' former U.S. Defense Secretary Robert McNamara said inan interview. ``I get the distinct impression they are changingsubstantially their view of the projection of power, in part on thebasis of their experience in Afghanistan, as in the United Stateswe were affected by our experience in Vietnam.''   McNamara, in Moscow this week for a conference on Sovietreforms, served as defense secretary in the 1960s during the heightof the Vietnam War under presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B.Johnson.   If Gorbachev's stated sentiment for focusing time and money onimproving the Soviet lifestyle is genuine, McNamara suggested, hewill find it expedient to reduce Soviet involvement in strugglesbetween pro- and anti-Communist forces.   He pointed to civil warfare in Nicaragua and Angola as exampleswhere Gorbachev may be willing to step out if the United States did.   Robert Legvold, director of Columbia University's HarrimanInstitute for Advanced Study of the Soviet Union, accompanied aU.S. Senate delegation to a three-hour meeting with Gorbachev lastweek.   He said he is convinced Gorbachev and his advisers have made acommitment to ``cut their losses'' in Afghanistan and have alreadybegun a serious analysis of how the mistake of intervening was made.   ``There is a feeling it was a lousy decision in all contexts _in U.S.-Soviet relations, in relations with Arab countries, inSino-Soviet relations,'' Legvold said.   The key move in working toward an Afghan peace accord was an endto Soviet insistence that the postwar government retain its currentsocialist character, said Legvold.   Stephen Cohen, a Princeton University professor and author ofseveral books on the Soviet Union, said the war in Afghanistancould teach the Kremlin ``the constraints of power'' and thatlosing a conventional war in the nuclear age does not necessarilythreaten their security.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Carol J.
