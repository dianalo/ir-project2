Biomass resources,and how they are used, are outlined under the categories of wood, grainsand agricultural wastes, peat, municipal wastes, and sewage or manures.Conversion techniques enumerated in this paper include combustion, gasification,liquefaction, pyrolysis, biodigestion and recycling. Methanol is highlightedas a fuel for the future, with production in Canada being possible throughnew processes using wood. A number of public programs for promoting biomassconversion are described. In the USA, these include financial incentivesfor use of biomass-derived fuels and for constructing alcohol fuel plants.In Brazil, alcohol derived from biomass is a major component of the nationalfuel supply. In Canada, three federal programs are noted: the ERIF programfor renewable energy in the forest industry; loan guarantees for exploitationof biomass energy; and the ENFOR forest energy program. In Quebec, provincialpolicy is to reduce oil imports, and renewable energy may play a partin fuel substitution. The overall conclusion is that biomass energy offersgreat potential for replacing petroleum as an energy source. 14 refs.,1 fig.</TEXT></DOC>
