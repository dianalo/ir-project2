 One to operate the PC.andP;  One to read the manual.andP;  And one to run tothe store for aspirin.andM;If you're doing mail-merges using only a word processor, you're working toohard--entering special codes and filenames and dealing with unforgivingformats.andP;  Sometimes even a misplaced comma can mean disaster.andP;  What's more,if you already have your mailing list in a database, you end up typinginformation twice.andM;The job is much easier when you use database software with your wordprocessor, as illustrated in the following pages.andP;  In this example, we useBorland's Paradox 3.0 to create a database and Microsoft Word 5.0 to preparethe document.andP;  You can use any combination of database and word processingsoftware, as long as the database software exports data in a format your wordprocessor can read.andP;  Most word processors, including Microsoft Word, usecomma-delimited ASCII files--a format most databases, Paradox among them, canwrite to--in mail-merges.andM;The company in our example, Small Business Seminars (SBS), stages trainingseminars for people who want to start small businesses.andP;  SBS has scheduled aseminar for next month, advertised it in the local paper, and received over100 inquiries so far from people who want more information.andP;  Now the SBSstaff has to send each of them a follow-up letter and a registration form.andO;When the registrations start coming in, they'll need to record the fees paidand send confirmation notes.andP;  Finally, when the seminar is over, eachparticipant should receive a thank-you letter and a notice about the nextevent.andM;Here is the six-step procedure they followed.andP;  You can use the same easyformula to make all of your mail-merge jobs a snap.andM;1 Set up the data-input screen in your database so you'll have all theinformation you need to accomplish the mailings you're planning.andM;We list names in two fields--first and last names--so that our letters can befriendly (&quot;Dear Bob&quot; instead of &quot;Dear Bob Brown&quot;).andP;  The first-name fieldshould be large enough to accommodate two names, as husbands and wives oftenattend these seminars together and return a single registration form.andP;  Wealso add a salutation field (for Mr., Mrs., Ms., or Mr. and Mrs.) so that wecan be formal (&quot;Dear Mr. Brown&quot;) if the occasion calls for it.andM;The address field should include two lines to accommodate suite or apartmentnumbers.andP;  And, of course, we need fields for city, state, and zip code, aswell as a phone number field in case questions arise about the registration.andM;That's enough information for the first mailing, but it's wise to add now thefields that will be needed later to manage the registration process andproduce the follow-up letters.andM;These include fields to identify when each letter is sent, fields to recordthe fee (Amount Received) and the date it was received, and a field to notewhether the person attended the seminar.andP;  These help avoid sending duplicatesin the second mailing and ensure that only those who participate in theseminar receive thank-you notes.andM;After entering names, addresses, and phone numbers for those who responded tothe ad, we're ready to prepare the first mailing.andM;2 Query the database to select the fields you want to include in your firstletter.andP;  Then export the result in comma-delimited ASCII format (or whatevermail-merge format your word processor can use).andM;Because the phone number and empty fields shouldn't appear in the mailing, weneed to query the database for only the salutation, name, address, city,state, and zip code.andP;  Paradox uses query by example (QBE), in which the userchecks off the fields needed; other databases may require entering theinformation in a command.andM;Once the query is done, the file can be exported in a mail-merge format tocreate a data document that the word processor can use.andP;  We export thedatabase in comma-delimited ASCII format.andP;  In performing the export, thedatabase simply puts the fields into a text file, surrounds each field entrywith quotation marks, separates the fields with commas, and puts a carriagereturn after the last field in each record.andM;To do this in Paradox, we go to the Using the Tools menu and selectExportImport, Export, ASCII, and Delimited.andP;  When we do the query, Paradoxputs the information in a table called Answer.andP;  But we should rename thedocument using a file extension the word processor recognizes.andP;  We name oursMERGE.DOC.andM;3 Exit the database, enter the word processor, and load the data document.andO;On the first line, type the header, including field names to match thoseyou'll put in the form letter.andM;When it runs the merge, the word processor will look for headings in thefirst line of the document to match those it finds in the form letter.andP;  So wetype in the field names we will use in the form letter--SAL, FIRSTNAME,LASTNAME, LINE1, LINE2, CITY, STATE, ZIP (Word is not case-sensitive; yourword processor may be)--and enter a carriage return at the end of the line.andM;Make a note of the headings you put at the top of the data document: you'llhave to spell them exactly the same way when you type the form letter.andM;Now we save the data document and create the form letter in the wordprocessor.andM;4 Write the form letter, inserting field names wherever you want to includeinformation from the data document.andP;  Run your mail-merge just as you would ifyou had created the data document in your word processor.andM;Within the form letter, we identify the heading names by surrounding themwith the symbols andless;andless; and andgt;andgt;, which Microsoft calls chevrons.andP;  Word will matchthe names within chevrons to the corresponding headings in the data documentand insert the appropriate information in the form letter.andP;  Other wordprocessors use other symbols and codes to distinguish fields; check yourmanual for the ones you need to use.andM;The word processor also will need to know the name of the data document toprocess the merge.andP;  In this example, we insert the filename MERGE.DOC withinchevrons in a line at the top of the form letter along with the word DATA todistinguish it from field headings.andM;Note the IF and ENDIF statements in the third and fourth lines of theaddress.andP;  These tell Word to look for text in the LINE2 field of the addressand skip the field if it finds none, so that letters won't include a blankline when that field in the data document is empty.andP;  Check your manual to seehow to do the same in your own word processor.andM;Note, too, that we include the LASTNAME heading twice.andP;  You can use theheadings as many times as you like in a document, and you can ignore fieldsthat you don't really need.andM;Now we run the mail-merge just as we would if we were doing it all within ourword processor.andP;  In Word, we do this by selecting Print, Merge from the menuand entering the name of the data document, MERGE.DOC.andM;Voila!andP;  The first batch of letter issues merrily from our LaserJet.andM;5 Return to the database input screen when you need to add information aboutwhen you sent the letter, when you received a response, and so on.andM;We return to the database first to enter the date that the first mailing wentout.andP;  In Paradox, we can use QBE and write BLANK, CHANGETO 03/01/90 in theDate Letter 1 Sent field, as shown here.andP;  Wherever Paradox finds a blank DateLetter 1 Sent field in a record, it will automatically write 03/01/90.andP;  Ifmore inquiries come in after that date, you can query the database to avoidsending duplicate letters.andM;Our letter did the trick.andP;  Fifty people returned registration forms alongwith checks for the seminar fee.andP;  After we enter the amounts and the dates wereceive the checks, we'll send confirmation letters.andP;  These will include theinformation we used in the first letter, plus information from the AmountReceived field.andM;To identify only the customers who registered, we again use Paradox's QBE,just as we did in Step 2.andP;  The only difference is that this time we alsocheck the Amount Received field.andP;  Then we export the Answer table to a mergedocument, rename it, and add the first line of field headings to the datadocument as we did for the first mailing.andP;  But this time we include the fieldheading Amount.andP;  (Anyone who does a lot of merges in Word can set up aglossary file of field headings and add them to data documents with a singlekeystroke; macros in other programs typically allow you to do the same.)andM;6 Create other form letters that include the updated information you've addedto the database.andM;As in the first letter, we use an IF statement in creating the confirmationletter.andP;  If we received $150, Word should write &quot;one ticket.&quot;andP;  Otherwise, itwill write &quot;two tickets.&quot;andP;  The IF statement lets us accurately respond tocouples as well as to single registrants.andM;These two merges are very similar, and the third follows much the sameprocedure: after the seminar, we'll fill in the Attended?andP;  field in ourdatabase with a Y or an N and generate thank-you notes.andM;Again, we extract records from the database, export them to a data document,rename it, load it into the word processor, add field headings, create theform letter, and print.andM;By now you should be getting the hang of it, and each time you do mail-mergesthis way, you'll find they get easier.andP;  After all, the hardest part of doinga mail-merge exclusively in a word processor is creating the data document;using your database makes that part a snap.andP;  So sit back and relax.andP;  Andthrow away the aspirin.andM;Mike Falkner is an independent microcomputer consultant and a PC coordinatorfor a large manufacturer in Sacramento, California.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
