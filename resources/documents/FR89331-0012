Background  </ITAG>Under the Copyright Act of 1976, Title 17, U.S. Code, copyright may ordinarilysubsist in an automated database either as an original compilation or assome other original work of authorship. Automated databases provide specialproblems for copyright deposit and examination, however, because many ofthem are constantly changing or the updates or other revisions may consistof small increments of information. To the extent that the basic databaseand the revisions are copyrightable, questions arise as to how best toregister the claims.  Current regulations allow the claimant to determine how frequently to registerupdates and other revisions of databases, but they do not allow groupingof separately published revised versions on a single registration. Specialrelief provisions already provide some flexibility in deposit requirementsand those provisions continue to be available to automated database registrants.37 CFR 202.20(d); see H.R. Rep. No. 94-1476, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 151 (1976).Specific regulations for machine-readable databases are provided in 37CFR 202.20(c)(2)(vii)(B).  The Copyright Act of 1976 encourages registration by conferring benefitson the claimant. Registration is a prerequisite to suit, 17 U.S.C. 411(a);\1\<NOTE/> if the registration is made before publication or withinfive years of first publication, the certificate of registration is primafacie evidence of the facts it states and of the validity of the copyright,17 U.S.C. 410(c), and by registering the work within three months of publication,the copyright owner reserves the right to claim statutory damages and discretionarycounsel fees. 17 U.S.C. 412. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\Registration will no longer be a prerequisite to suit forBerne Convention works whose country of origin is not the United States,effective March 1, 1989. Pub. L. 100-568, 102 Stat. 2853 (October 31, 1988). Pursuant to 17 U.S.C. 103, ``copyright in a compilation or derivative workextends only to the material contributed by the author of such work, asdistinguished from the preexisting material employed in the work, and doesnot imply any exclusive right in the preexisting material.'' The CopyrightAct requires special information in connection with registration of suchworks.  Section 408 of the Copyright Act requires deposit of material in connectionwith applications for copyright registration of unpublished and publishedworks. Subsection 408 (c)(1) authorizes the Register of Copyrights to specifyclasses into which works may be placed for purposes of deposit and registration.One of the alternatives is ``a single registration for a group of relatedworks.''  When the Copyright Office issued initial deposit regulations under the1976 general revision of the copyright law, several comments requestedprovisions for group registration of revisions and updates of automateddatabases. 43 FR 763 (Jan. 4, 1978). At that time the Office invited furthercomments and suggestions as to the type of related works that could becovered by group registration and the deposit and registration requirementsapplicable in those cases. In 43 FR 965 (January 5, 1978), however, theOffice ``reserved for implementation in a separate proceeding the possibilityof providing for `a single registration for a group of related works' underparagraph (c)(1) of section 408.'' The allowance for group registration,except for certain published contributions to periodicals, 17 U.S.C. 408(c)(2),is discretionary with the Copyright Office, and the Office heretofore haselected not to exercise this discretionary authority.  On February 14, 1985, (50 FR 6208), the Copyright Office requested publiccomment on proposed amendments to the regulations governing deposit. Inresponse to this general request, the Association of American Publishers(AAP) and the Information Industry Association (IIA) commented specificallyon the deposit and registration of databases. AAP suggested that the CopyrightOffice develop regulations to meet the problems of deposit for dynamicdatabases subject to regular revision, expansion, or other change. AAPproposed regulations that would permit a single ``group'' registrationfor varying versions (enhancements, updates, and other modifications) ofa database, and related databases, published within a twelve month periodor any lesser period within twelve months, on the basis of a single depositand application. AAP also proposed that the Copyright Office accept fordeposit reasonable portions of output, rather than `raw data' or the like,and that generally, deposit requirements for successive or single groupregistrations of revised databases should be diminished.       IIA also urged the addition of a new regulation that would permit groupregistration of databases, under certain conditions. The group registrationwould require that works have the same copyright claimant, the same generaltitle, and similar general content, including subject and organization.IIA proposed that if the works are published, each must bear a separatecopyright notice as first published and have the same copyright owner,and the work or works must be first published within three months beforeregistration. This organization suggested that since a deposit for databaseswould not show the full extent of the registration or the entirety of thework, the Copyright Office should accept relevant evidence for the examinationof authorship. Such evidence might be documentary evidence of the continuingprocess of creation, hard copy extracts (for example, the first and last25 pages), and the same direct online access as is offered the customer.Finally, IIA advocated the use of special relief that would allow the Registerof Copyrights to ``permit the deposit of identifying material which doesnot comply with andSection; 202.21 of the regulations.''On June 10, 1985 (50 FR 24240), the Copyright Office published a Noticeof Inquiry inviting public comment on the feasibility of a single groupregistration for databases, deposit based on reasonable portions of output,and deposit based on description of content and its relation to prior deposits.Additionally, the Office invited public comment specifically on the recommendationsmade by IIA and AAP.In response to comments received regarding that notice, the Office, onOctober 5, 1987 (52 FR 37167), proposed regulations providing for singlegroup registration for automated databases with deposit based on reasonableportions of output. The Office received fourteen comments in response toits proposed rulemaking. After careful consideration, we have decided toimplement in final form the provision for group registration, andSection;202.3(b)(4), and to amend for purposes of clarification the deposit provisionsin connection with group registration at andSection; 202.20(c)(2)(vii).All of the commentators supported the decision to provide for group registrationof automated databases, including their revised versions, however, mostcommentators disagreed with two specific requirements in the Office's proposedprocedures for making such registrations. The IIA submitted the most detailedcomments, which, for the most part, incorporated the recommendations madeby other commentators, six of whom expressly endorsed the IIA's position.In issuing this regulation, we reconfirm and incorporate the rationalestated in the proposed regulation regarding the experimental nature ofregulations to implement the discretionary authority for group registration.Additionally, we discuss below the comments received in response to theproposed rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">2. Identification of New Material</ITAG>Under 17 U.S.C. 408(c)(1), the Register of Copyrights is authorized ``tospecify by regulation the administrative classes into which works are tobe placed for purposes of deposit and registration. * * * The regulationsmay require or permit * * * a single registration for a group of relatedworks.'' Thus, the Copyright Office proposed group registration of automateddatabases as a special and discretionary provision. These deposit regulationsprovide that the applicant identify the original authorship in which copyrightis being claimed in a revised database by marking the deposit. Specifically,the identifying portions must be ``marked to disclose the copyrightablerevision added on at least one representative publication * * * or * ** creation date'' and be accompanied by a descriptive statement that identifiesthe location within the database where the copyrightable changes may befound. IIA and nine other commentators objected to this requirement. Three otherproprietors, and one database user, however, supported adoption of theregulations without challenging the marking feature.Most commentators who opposed the requirement of marking the deposit andidentifying the location of changes did so on the grounds that the requirementsare too burdensome and that automated databases are not distinguishablefrom other databases. Therefore, they should not be subject to differentregistration requirements from other works. They point out that registrationregulations for other derivative works do not require marking or locatingthe changes. Additionally, some commentators state that publishers wouldbe required to devote substantial staff resources to the preparation ofa deposit.Electronic Data Systems Corporation (EDS), the sole comment representinga database user, considered the Office's effort in assuring that identifyingportions adequately disclose the copyrightable content of the changes acritical factor in the proposed regulations. ``This is a key provisionboth in your comments and in your proposed regulations. What changes reallywere made to justify the updated copyright and [are] those noted with enoughspecificity that it would be easy for the Copyright Office to distinguishbetween databases submitted at different times?'' This comment indicatesthat the biggest problem for the user is determining what data is coveredby copyright and what is not.Recognition of the special nature of automated databases moved the CopyrightOffice in its 1978 regulations to establish a more liberal form of depositfor such works; i.e., databases were exempted from the complete copy requirementand allowed to deposit the equivalent of 50 pages. Group registration representsanother liberalization in special recognition of registration and depositproblems unique to automated databases. In limiting this proposal exclusivelyto online automated databases, both published and unpublished, the Officeconsidered their unique nature_the size of databases, their periodic revision,and the dissemination of the work in machine-readable format.The effect of these regulations is to significantly liberalize the registrationrequirements for a large group of published works, heretofore registrableonly with a separate deposit, application and fee for each separately publishedversion. Under the proposed regulations, the applicant may submit one depositwhere previously as many as ninety deposits, with as many accompanyingapplications and fees, might have been required to register the same copyrightablecontent.In explaining the proposed regulation, we found that sufficient factorssuch as size, complexity and technological characteristics exist to distinguishthe automated database from other groups of related works and that thesefactors justify group registration for automated databases under a certainset of facts, at least on an experimental basis. In general, one salienttechnological characteristic is the rapidly changing content of databases.In light of these factors, it is unrealistic to expect the Copyright Officeto treat databases exactly the same as other derivative works, althoughthe Office sees more equivalency in the procedures than some commentators.The requirements that have been criticized were designed to alleviate someof the burdens of examining a group of works based on a single applicationand deposit. They are also responsive to the unique nature of automateddatabases: frequent updates; incremental changes, which are sometimes minor;the absence of a hard-copy record of the changes in general; and the tendencyto commingle copyrightable and uncopyrightable matter. Moreover, the Officemust consider not only its own administrative burdens, but also its obligationto identify the work being claimed and to establish an adequate publicrecord for the benefit of the courts and in the general public interest.Given the strong presumption of copyright validity that attaches to registeredworks, it is incorrect to argue that defects in the registration recordharm only the proprietor-plaintiff.As a second major point in support of its objection to marking and locatingthe revised material, IIA contends that such individual marking would notnecessarily reveal copyrightable material. In addition to the overall generalsupport for the IIA position expressed by other commentators, the AAP andDunn and Bradstreet also expressly objected to the marking requirementfor this reason.The proposed registration calls for the disclosure of revisions that wouldbe registrable under the standards applicable to all other periodicallyrevised works_that is, revisions that as a whole constitute an originalwork of authorship and entitle the work to registration.Examination of the work to determine whether it constitutes copyrightablesubject matter is the principal responsibility of the Copyright Officein making registration of claims to copyright. 17 U.S.C. 410(a). Most ofthe other material allegations to support a registration (e.g., the nameand citizenship of the author, the name of the claimant, the place of publication,etc.) cannot be verified by the Copyright Office, and yet are accordeda legal presumption of validity. The requirement of marking the depositto identify some copyrightable changes in one representative update shouldfacilitate the processing of applications for group registration of automateddatabases. The alternative would be for the Office to correspond in manycases to obtain a more complete description of the copyrightable changes,if we adopted the IIA proposal. We reject this alternative as administrativelyburdensome.Some misunderstanding may exist as to the nature of the marking requirement.We do not require that every copyrightable change be marked and identifiedfor the representative date selected by the applicant. We require insteadthat sufficient copyrightable changes be marked and identified to enablethe Copyright Office to carry out its statutory responsibility of determiningthat the revised version is indeed an original work of authorship. Theapplicant can select the particular revised version that evinces sufficientauthorship, including the most recent version, since the last registrationof the database. If in fact the nature of the changes in the three monthinterval does not satisfy the original work of authorship standard forcopyright protection, then no new registration is necessary or warranted.If the work has not been changed to constitute a new original work of authorship,copyright for the preceding (or original) version should protect againstany copying of the database.Accordingly, group registration will be made for periodically updated orotherwise revised databases only upon a showing that changes give riseto another original work of authorship. Where the Office determines thatonly a few minor revisions have been made in the representative deposit,registration will be subject to question, and absent more justification,will be denied. The Office will not make registration based solely on aclaim of structure, sequence, and organization. These terms are ambiguous,and may refer to uncopyrightable ideas, systems, or processes. Therefore,claims described as so-called ``SSO'' are unacceptable. Claims in ``selectionand arrangement'' are of course acceptable since these terms appear inthe statutory definition of ``compilation.''The requirement for marking revisions from one representative publicationor creation date is related also to the Office's view that each separatelypublished version is potentially a separate and independent work of authorship.As such, whether a derivative work is copyrightable depends on the contentof each version as compared to earlier versions of the work. Contrary tothe IIA's argument, comparison with earlier versions is relevant when copyrightis claimed as a derivative work. 17 U.S.C. 103(b). The same policy is reflectedin the regulation providing that there should be only one basic registrationper work. 37 CFR 202.3(6). See also H.R. Rep. No. 94-1476, 94th Cong.,2d Sess. 155 (1976). If Congress granted a new copyright upon every republicationof a work, copyright could be extended in perpetuity in basic conflictwith the limited times provision of the Constitution's clause. Thus, atbest, no purpose is served by reregistering material already covered byan earlier registration. At worst, extending the copyright without newauthorship exceeds the statutory and constitutional grant.For these reasons then the Office considers reasonable a requirement thatthe claimant delineate with some particularity a claim in revised automateddatabases seeking group registration. The Office, of course, will acceptdeposit of a copy disclosing only the actual additions or modificationsmade on a representative day (for example the data input), in lieu of amarked print-out showing the changes. We have revised andSection; 202.20(c)(2)(vii)(B)(<T3>5</T3>) to clarify that a deposit showing only the new matter is acceptable.<ITAG tagnum="84">3. Description of the Origins of Data</ITAG>Two commentators objected to the requirement that a description of theorigins of data be included in the statement to accompany identifying portions.We have already addressed the charges of disparate treatment of databases,noting the general equivalency of the requirements but also justifyingdepartures from equivalency on the ground of the special nature of automateddatabases. Some of the departures favor proprietors, and some do not. Congressintended that the application contain information about preexisting worksand that information is required for other works. 17 U.S.C. 409(9). Onthis point, the House Report states that this requirement that, ``in thecase of a `compilation or derivative work' the application include an identificationof any preexisting work or works that it is based on or incorporates ** * '' is intended to elicit a clear statement of the copyright statusof material included in a compilation. H.R. Rep. at 156. The origin ofdata requirement is merely a request for information about preexistingworks in order to make a more meaningful group registration record.<ITAG tagnum="84">4. Reasonable Portions of Output</ITAG>Earlier in this proceeding, the AAP proposed that the Office prescribedeposits for dynamic databases based on reasonable portions of output ratherthan raw data. The Office has proceeded on the assumption that either outputor raw data is acceptable as a deposit, and the regulation clarifies thismatter.<ITAG tagnum="84">5. Representative Day</ITAG>The proposed deposit requirements specify that identifying portions shallbe from a revised version as it existed on one representative publicationor creation date. As stated earlier, the intent is to obtain identifyingportions of copyrightable content from one self-contained work rather thanseveral works. The IIA asked us to clarify that the Office intends no implicationthat only one work can come into being on a given day. We agree that itis theoretically possible for more than one new version to be created onone day. The Office decided, however, to restrict the requirement for identifyingportions merely to one day, for administrative purposes. As a practicalmatter, we also think that one day's updates are particularly relevantin the case of published databases. It would not be meaningful to attemptseparate identification of changes made during a period of time less thanone day.The regulations do not negate the possibility of special relief, underappropriate circumstances. 37 C.F.R. 202.20(d). Also, individual registrationof revised versions continues to be available as an option. Some commentsassert that for constantly changing databases it would be virtually impossibleto identify all of one edition's changes and appropriately mark a depositcopy. This concern is misplaced. As discussed under Item 2 above, it isnot necessary to identify all changes. The requirement is to identify sufficientchanges to establish that the work submitted for registration is an originalwork of authorship. Additionally, it is possible to submit 50 pages ora set of 50 data records of entirely new material accompanied by a descriptivestatement that gives information to that effect.<ITAG tagnum="84">6. Three-Month Period</ITAG>The AAP urges a single, group registration for all revisions to a databasecovering a twelve month period. Although it originally suggested a three-monthperiod, IIA now supports the AAP proposal. Except for one other comment,which noted that even if we established a one year period as the outerlimit, most registrations would likely occur within three months, no othercomments expressed a desire for a broader window of registration than threemonths.At this time, the Office adopts the three month period for group registrationof a database and its updates. Prompt registration has been an importantobjective since the beginning of copyright in the United States. Thereis even more reason to adhere to a three month provision where not allof any one work will be deposited and the archival record for the workmust necessarily be less than complete. Registration on a yearly basisexacerbates the problems presented by this kind of deposit and would createthe potential for registering more than 300 works on one application, witha modicum of identifying deposit material.We have concluded that a three month registration interval, accompaniedby a suitable deposit, creates a better archival record and would be moreuseful and reliable as a source of information on the content of the worksbeing registered. While registration fees are not a primary consideration,database registrants will enjoy substantial savings even for quarterlyfilings. Above all, the Office is concerned about the administrative difficultiesof examining an application that covers multiple works. Group registrationof databases must be viewed as experimental and must be re-evaluated afteran appropriate period. Finally, we clarify in the final regulation thatthe three-month span must fall within a single calendar year. Since mostdatabases are works made for hire, the date of publication affects theterm. The Office concludes that a single registration should not be madefor related works whose terms of copyright differ.<ITAG tagnum="84">7. Online Access in Lieu of Deposit</ITAG>Several commentators have suggested that the Office accept online accessin lieu of deposit. We have not at this time adopted this suggestion becauseadministrative procedures have not been developed to monitor revisionsand then capture some physical representation of the work for archivalpurposes. While the Office does not rule out such a deposit solution forthe future, more information is needed than is currently available. Moreover,the Office assumes that copyright proprietors would expect some assurancesthat the online access would be strictly limited to examining purposes.Assurances of that kind, if possible, would require careful consultationwith other departments of the Library to establish the necessary controls.<ITAG tagnum="84">8. Notice of Copyright</ITAG>The Berne Implementation Act of 1988 eliminates the mandatory nature ofthe notice of copyright for works first published on or after March 1,1989. We have accordingly modified the references to notice of copyrightin the final regulation. Mandatory notice is retained in section andSection;202.3(b)(4)(i)(E) for works published before March 1, 1989. The identifyingdescriptive statement must disclose the notice, ``if the work bears a notice.''Where notice of copyright is used, group registration is possible onlyif the notices identify the same claimant for each update.<ITAG tagnum="84">9. Special Instructions in Lieu of New Form</ITAG>In the proposed regulations, the Copyright Office indicated that Form TXwould be used to register the first version of a database submitted forregistration and an adjunct form would be used to register subsequent updatesor revisions.The final regulations provide instead that Form TX will be used to registerboth the initial version and subsequent updates of automated databases.Instead of a new adjunct form, the Office, on an experimental basis, hasprepared special instructions for completing the Form TX when applyingfor group registration of an automated database and its updates. The SpecialInstructions for Group Registration of Automated Databases may be obtainedupon request on the same basis as any Copyright Office form or publication.After acquiring experience with respect to group registration of automateddatabases, the Office may prepare a new adjunct form. <ITAG tagnum="84">10. Clarification of Miscellaneous Points</ITAG>IIA and several other commentators suggested certain other clarifying amendments.Among the technical amendments adopted, the following should be especiallynoted:a. Instead of using the term ``updates'' alone, the language has been expandedto avoid any implication that only the revisions made in response to developmentsoccurring after creation of the previously registered work are subjectto group registration.b. We have clarified that deposit of output is appropriate. Identifyingportions sufficient to satisfy the deposit requirements may be submittedin the form of output, rather than input, or raw data. It is the acceptanceof output as deposit material that clearly necessitates the applicant'sdistinguishing between material that has been added in the version beingregistered and output that was stored in machine-readable form in earlierversions of the work.c. We have substituted `'general'' for ``collective'' title in andSection;202.3(b)(4)(i)(B) to avoid any implication that the database must conformto the definition of ``collective work'' under 17 U.S.C. 101.d. We confirm that group registration is available for both published andunpublished databases.e. We have renumbered subsections to clarify that the applicant need notsubmit a descriptive statement for a single file database that is not aderivative work.In this first exercise of our administrative discretion to register a groupof related works under section 408(c)(1) of the Copyright Act, we willevaluate administrative experience and the experience of applicants filingunder this new rule. We will also continue to monitor emerging decisionallaw with respect to automated databases, and will reconsider the properscope of, and conditions for group registration of databases, as appropriate.Further refinements may be indicated.<ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG>With respect to the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Copyright Office takesthe position that this Act does not apply to the Copyright Office rulemaking.The Copyright Office is a department of the Library of Congress and ispart of the legislative branch. Neither the Library of Congress nor theCopyright Office is an ``agency'' within the meaning of the AdministrativeProcedure Act of June 11, 1946, as amended (Title 5, Chapter 5 of the U.S.Code, Subchapter II and Chapter 7). The Regulatory Flexibility Act consequentlydoes not apply to the Copyright Office since the Act affects only thoseentities of the Federal Government that are agencies as defined in theAdministrative Procedure Act.\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ The Copyright Office was not subject to the AdministrativeProcedure Act before 1978, and it is not subject to it only in areas specifiedby section 701(d) of the Copyright Act (i.e., ``all actions taken by theRegister of Copyrights under this title [17],'' except with respect tothe making of copies of copyright deposits). [17 U.S.C. 706(b)]. The CopyrightAct does not make the Office an ``agency'' as defined in the AdministrativeProcedure Act. For example, personnel actions taken by the Office are notsubject to APA-FOIA requirements.Alternatively, if it is later determined by a court of competent jurisdictionthat the Copyright Office is an ``agency'' subject to the Regulatory FlexibilityAct, the Register of Copyrights has determined and hereby certifies thatthis regulation will have no significant impact on small businesses.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 37 CFR Part 202</ITAG>Registration of Claims to Copyright, Claims to copyright, Copyright registration.<ITAG tagnum="84">Final Regulations</ITAG>In consideration of the foregoing, Part 202 of 37 CFR, Chapter II is amendedas follows:1.
