The market may remain what it has beenin the recent months, mainly a short term market, more responsive tothe expectations of different factors than to fundamental aspects relatedto the behavior of supply, demand and stocks. In such circumstances,the excess of supply will persist for some time, but sooner or laterwe will return to a situation of scarcity and oil shock with increasingprices. Now, stability depends on the capacity and political will ofall exporters to set mechanisms of effective and long standing regulationof supply; it also requires that transactions send long term signalsto the market so that it may be able to establish more realistic prices,instead of what some analysts have called &quot;a price for every occasion&quot;.From the point of view of Mexico, the option of a negotiated agreementbetween producers is the only alternative that allows to minimize lossesin terms of income in the short term.</TEXT></DOC>
