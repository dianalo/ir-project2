The lawsuit, filed Friday in Dallas federal court by theFederal Deposit Insurance Corp., names former Democraticfund-raiser Thomas M. Gaubert and his brother, Jack R.Gaubert, who were co-chairmen of Independent American.</LP><TEXT>   Also named in the suit are the thrift's former chiefexecutive officer, Tommy G. Lane of Arlington, Texas; formerpresident, Jerry G. Payne of Dallas; and former vicepresident for finances, John W. Brophy, a Dallas accountant.   The suit, which seeks $150 million in punitive damages inaddition to the $50 million in actual damages, accuses theformer officers of conspiring to defraud the thrift bydirecting questionable loans to business associates and bybuying portions of nonperforming loans from other thrifts tohelp conceal those thrifts' losses from regulators. Only twoof the loans in question were made while Thomas M. Gaubertwas co-chairman of Independent American. The two loans, whichallegedly caused losses of $2 million each, were made beforeMr. Gaubert relinquished control of the thrift in 1984 in anagreement with federal regulators.   The FDIC lawsuit is the latest filed in a spate oflitigation between Mr. Gaubert and federal thrift regulators.Mr. Gaubert is suing the government in two courts forpersonal losses he suffered in the government takeover ofIndependent American, and he won acquittal in October 1988 onloan-fraud charges related to an Iowa thrift. Mr. Gaubert'sattorney, Abbe David Lowell of Washington, D.C., said theFDIC's new lawsuit is &quot;retaliation&quot; for his client'slawsuits.   &quot;Like so many of the FDIC lawsuits, it promises in itscomplaint more than it will ever produce in court,&quot; Mr.Lowell said.   Jack Gaubert's attorney, Robert M. Greenberg, said hehadn't seen the suit and couldn't comment. The otherdefendants couldn't be reached for comment.   The suit was filed almost three years to the day afterfederal thrift regulators placed Independent American inreceivership. The defunct thrift, which had $793.7 million inassets, was later merged into Sunbelt Savings Association ofDallas.</TEXT></DOC>
