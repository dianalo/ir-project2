Mohammed Ahmed, a Maldivian Foreign Ministry official, said thesentences were ordered Sunday by the high court in Male, capital ofthe Maldives.   Sources in Male who spoke on condition of anonymity said ChiefJustice Moosa Fathy read the sentences at a public hearing afternearly two months of trial. No dates were set for the executions,they said.   Ahmed said there was no higher court of appeal and that onlyPresident Maumoon Abdul Gayoom could commute the sentences.   The last death sentence carried out in the Maldives was in 1953,he said when contacted by telephone from New Delhi.   The Maldives, a string of coral islands in the Indian Ocean, areabout 500 miles southwest of Sri Lanka and roughly the samedistance south of India.   Eight other Sri Lankans were sentenced to jail terms, Ahmedsaid. He said he did not know the exact terms.   A total of 68 Sri Lankans and seven Maldivians were arrestedafter the Nov. 3 coup attempt, which was crushed by Indianparatroopers responding to a call for help from Gayoom. At least 17people, mosty local residents, were killed in the fighting.   The Maldivian government has said the Sri Lankans weremercenaries and belonged to a Sri Lankan guerrilla group, thePeople's Liberation Organization of Tamil Eelam, which participatedin a Tamil separatist war against Sri Lanka's Sinhalese majority.   Ahmed said the others accused were to appear in court later thisweek for verdicts and sentencing.   The coup was led by Abdullah Luthufi, a Sri Lanka-basedMaldivian. Ahmed said Luthufi has appeared in court but that nodecision has been made in his case.</TEXT></DOC>
