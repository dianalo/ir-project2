There should be no mistake aboutthat, and it's a pontentially tragic mistake,'' Matell said.   ``It places 3,600 pilot careers in jeopardy and it risks the veryexistance of a great airline,'' he said. ``But maybe, just maybe,it's not too late.''   Matell said that about 150 pilots had crossed the picket linesSaturday, and said there were indications more would work Sunday.   Eastern was able to get only 85 of its normal 1,000 Saturdayflights into the air because the pilots couldn't be matched withavailable aircraft quickly enough, Matell said.   Eastern expected to fly 125 flights Sunday, and had managed toget 12 up by 10 a.m., he said.   Eastern managers thought they had prepared for the stike byhiring non-unionists and slashing the weekend schedule by up to 75percent, but those plans ripped apart when most pilots and flightattendants honored picket lines.   Ron Cole, a spokesman for the pilots union, had said Saturdaythat ``It's very clear the airline isn't going to fly without us.''   Meanwhile, sympathizers across the country were mobilizing formassive pickets Monday that threatened rush-hour nightmares,especially in the congested New York metropolitan area. Strikersplanned picketing at commuter railroads and received assurances thatno rail workers would cross their lines.   The walkout that began at 12:01 a.m. Saturday by 8,500 mechanics,bag handlers and ground crews escalated a 17-month union-managementbattle at the nation's seventh-largest airline, which ordinarilyschedules more than 1,000 flights with 100,000 passengers daily.   Both sides were deadlocked on $150 million in wage concessionsthat company boss Frank Lorenzo demanded. Talks collapsed inWashington at midnight Friday and no new discussions were planned.   The main target of the striker hostility was Lorenzo, head ofTexas Air Corp., which bought Eastern in 1986.   He is widely mistrusted by Eastern workers because of what theycall his triumphant union-crushing campaign at sister carrierContinental Airlines in 1983. Many accuse him of provoking thestrike to do the same at Eastern.   Battered by years of labor tension and growing competition in thederegulated airline business, Eastern has racked up nearly $2.5billion in debt and claims to be losing more than $1 million a day.</TEXT></DOC>
