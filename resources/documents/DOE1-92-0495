Six years of analysing and experimenting were dedicatedto an occupied 12-family house characterized by its extraordinary thermalinsulation and equipped with two independent solar systems with threedifferent types of vacuum collectors. A detailed description is givenof the building design and installations (solar systems, heating systems,ventilation, automation) as well as of the systems' operational and functionalfeatures, management and operating experiences, measuring methods, dataacquisition and evaluation of results. The test results made availablerepresent the collector efficiency (diagram), the collector system (characteristics),monthly irradiation, collector gains, monthly water and heat demandsand energy flows. Further remarks are dedicated to the model of componentsof the solar water heating system and the systems analysis relevant toit. (HWJ)</TEXT></DOC>
