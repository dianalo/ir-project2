Each factor has a different target cell in thebody, and each has a possible role in protecting the body'snerve cells against damage from the likes of Alzheimer'sdisease, Parkinson's disease and Lou Gehrig's disease.   An explosion of discovery in recent years has yieldedinsights into a &quot;superfamily&quot; of proteins calledneurotrophic, or nerve growth, factors. Human clinical trialsusing such factors may begin as early as this year.</LP><TEXT>   Alzheimer's disease, causing dementia and death, afflictsan estimated 3.5 million Americans. Hopes for treatment werebuoyed in the late 1980s by Fred M. Gage, a neuroscientist atthe University of California at San Diego. Dr. Gage taught agroup of senile rats to swim through a water maze. He thentreated half the rats with nerve-growth factor and the restwith a placebo. After a 10-day rest period, the rats were putthrough their aquatic paces again. Only the rats treated withnerve-growth factor found their way through the maze.   &quot;In a variety of learning and memory tests, it was showninfusions of nerve-growth factor into the brain could improvelearning capacity and increased the size of neurons that hadshrunken,&quot; says Dr. Gage. His findings galvanizedbiotechnology companies.   &quot;The real excitement of those experiments is that they'rein a natural animal system caused by aging,&quot; says FrankCollins, vice president of neuroscience at Synergen Inc., aBoulder, Colo., company developing nerve-growth factor withSyntex Corp. of Palo Alto, Calif. The Synergen-Syntex teamcould begin human clinical testing in late 1993. GenentechInc. is also working on the factor.   In Parkinson's disease, the brain cells controllingmovement tend to degenerate, causing tremors and weakness.Now there is an animal model suggesting one new factor mightwork to restore damaged cells. The observation grew from achemical mishap among drug addicts who used a &quot;designer&quot; drugmimicking heroin. That drug was contaminated with aneurotoxin, MPTP, that provoked quaking, jerky motions muchlike those of Parkinson's. However, in monkey tests, nervecells were protected from MPTP by a protein called basicfibroblast growth factor.   Basic fibroblast growth factor is being pursued by SciosInc. (formerly California Biotechnology Inc.) of MountainView, Calif., and Chiron Corp. of Emeryville, Calif., incollaboration with Johnson andamp; Johnson. Synergen and Syntex areinvestigating the protein for stroke patients and havediscovered another new protein for Parkinson's disease.   Yet another new biotechnology product -- brain-derivedneurotrophic factor -- is aimed at salvaging the shatteredneurons of Parkinson's patients. This product is made byGenentech and a collaboration of Amgen Inc. of Thousand Oaks,Calif., and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Tarrytown, N.Y.Those same companies are competing to develop still anotherrelated protein called neurotrophin-3 as a possible candidateto treat Alzheimer's and various kinds of nerve damage.   The disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which ended thebaseball career of the legendary Lou Gehrig, will soon betargeted by another new growth factor. In the disease's finalstages, patients are hooked to a respirator, able to moveonly their eyes. &quot;The husband of one patient told me he'skept her alive so she can receive this protein,&quot; saysSynergen's Dr. Collins. Tests of the substance -- calledciliary neurotrophic factor -- are planned by Regeneron andthe Syntex/Synergen team. &quot;We expect to be in the clinic bymid-1992,&quot; a Synergen spokeswoman says.   The difficulty with nerve-growth factor and its chemicalkin is that most of the molecules are large and unwieldy.Unable to reach their target cells via tablets or normalinjections, they must so far be pumped directly into thebrain.   &quot;Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Lou Gehrig's disease aredevastating, so it becomes contemplatable to plant a pump&quot; inthe brain, says Dr. Collins. &quot;If you simply forget the carkeys, it's debatable whether you want to do that.&quot;   Eventually, new drug-delivery technologies like nasalsprays may simplify treatment and enable doctors to dream ofearly treatment or even prevention.   ---              Growth Factors in the Lab   NERVE GROWTH FACTOR: Slated for clinical tests inAlzheimer's disease by a collaboration of Syntex Corp. andSynergen Inc.; also researched by Genentech Inc.
