Although central bank activity in support of the dollar appeared to increase yesterday, traders said those dollar purchases were too small to offset the negative sentiment in the market. Traders speculate that the U.S. and its major allies are willing to allow the dollar to decline as long as it does so gradually.    &quot;They want to keep it from falling too rapidly,&quot; Yani M.A. Budiman, vice president, corporate foreign exchange, at Chemical Bank, New York, said.    There were renewed indications, however, that the Bank of Japan wants a more aggressive defense of the dollar to protect Japan's export-oriented economy. The Japanese central bank, traders said, may differ from some other major central banks in its understanding of the goals of this year's international agreements on exchange-rate policy.    According to traders at New York banks, the U.S. Federal Reserve bought a modest amount of dollars against the West German mark and Japanese yen yesterday. In Tokyo, dealers estimated that the Bank of Japan sold yen to buy between $100 million and $150 million during trading there.    The West German Bundesbank bought $48.9 million at the Frankfurt foreign exchange fixing, and traders there said the central bank bought additional dollars in the open market. The Swiss National Bank also bought dollars with Swiss francs, a spokesman in Zurich confirmed.    Officials have described the recent central bank intervention as in accordance with the multinational agreement reached in Paris in February to try to maintain stability in the currency markets. But news reports from Japan yesterday indicated that Japanese officials are interpreting that agreement differently from their U.S. counterparts.    According to those reports, Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told a Parliament meeting that the major economic powers have been trying to &quot;confine the dollar in a certain range&quot; since the so-called Plaza agreement, reached in New York in September 1985. He was quoted as saying that policy was reaffirmed at the Venice economic summit this year.    In Vienna, however, Fed Governor H. Robert Heller, who is attending a monetary conference in the Austrian capital, said in response to a question that the Paris accord didn't set any specific exchange-rate boundaries for the dollar.    Separately, Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita was reported to be planning to ask Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan to step up Fed support of the dollar because of the harm that further declines in the U.S. currency could cause to the Japanese economy.    The two central bank chiefs are scheduled to attend a meeting of the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland, Monday. A Fed spokesman in Washington wouldn't comment on the report regarding Mr. Sumita.    In any case, the expectation among currency traders is that the dollar will continue to weaken until the U.S. merchandise trade deficit starts to narrow. Traders who deal directly with central banks said the banks' recent interventions have been relatively modest, which indicates that policy makers also see further declines in the dollar as inevitable.    &quot;They're not looking to prop it up, and the market views this as a sign of weakness,&quot; one such trader in New York said.    The trader said the market sentiment on the dollar also takes into account that Mr. Greenspan had called for a lower dollar before he was nominated to head the Fed this summer.    In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar stood at 1.7966 marks, just above its intraday low, compared with 1.8085 marks late Tuesday. The dollar also fell to 140.83 yen from 141.45 and to 1.4838 Swiss francs from 1.4930.    The Bank of France sold marks for French francs in an apparent attempt to dissuade speculators from sending the French currency too low while the dollar's weak spell is strengthening the mark, traders said.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose $10.50 an ounce to $465.30 in brisk trading. Estimated volume was 5.3 million ounces.    The dollar was quoted at 140.50 yen in early Tokyo trading today.    Gold was quoted at $463.35 an ounce in early trading today in Hong Kong.    ---   Alan Murray contributed to this article.    ---                 LATE NEW YORK TRADING                Wednesday, Sept. 2, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
