SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A Reagan administration proposal to reduce thequestions asked in the 1990 Census drew fire Wednesday from cityofficials and statisticians who said vital information would belost.   The White House Office of Management and Budget has requiredthat several questions be dropped, or asked of fewer people, inthis spring's Census dress rehearsal.   No final decision has been made on whether the changes will beextended to the 1990 census, according to Joseph R. Wright Jr. ofOMB, who contended the cuts were made to reduce the paperworkburden on the public.   But the dress rehearsal head counts in the states of Washingtonand Missouri are scheduled for March 20. On April 1, the formalquestions planned for the 1990 census must be sent to Congress.   The proposed changes would introduce ``crippling samplingerrors'' into the Census, charged Arthur Young, retired chief ofthe Census Bureau's housing division.   Young spoke at a joint hearing of the House Select Committee onAging and the subcommittee on Housing and Consumer Interests.   ``It will look like a full census, but it will be nothing but ahollow shell,'' Young said. Eliminating questions or cutting byhalf the number of people answering some of them would all buteliminate much data on city block areas, he said.   ``The OMB cuts will leave the nation after the 1990 census witha housing data base inadequate for decision making at the locallevel,'' he said. And this loss of information would occur at atime when more and more programs are being switched from federal tostate and local operation.   Art Holland, mayor of Trenton, N.J., added the warning that thecuts ``could have potentially debilitating impacts upon the citiesof this nation to adequately plan for the future and to allocatescarce resources for the betterment of their residents andbusinesses.'   You don't have to be a statistician to know that reducing thenumber of people asked a particular question reduces the quality ofthe data collected, Holland went on.   Cities use census information to target community developmentblock grant funds and economic development money, to preparehousing master plans, to target neighborhood eligibility forfederal, state and local assistance and to pinpoint areas in needof programs, he said.   The cities depend on the census every 10 years as their primarysource of information, and all other collections of information usethe census as a base, or are mere estimates, he added.   The OMB proposal would drop questions on the cost of utilities,type of heating equipment and fuel used to heat water. In additionseven questions would be moved from the short form answered byeveryone to the longer form sent only to a sample of households.Those include information on number of rooms in a house, plumbing,rent and value, presence of a telephone and whether the residenceis a condominium.</TEXT></DOC>
