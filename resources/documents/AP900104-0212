Petre said the new government, put in place by the NationalSalvation Front until free elections planned in April, would try todecentralize control over state-owned enterprises, but said theidea of privatization had not been raised, the newspaper reported.   ``We favor the abolition of the state's monopoly on foreigntrade but for now, our economy is a planned economy,'' he wasquoted as saying. ``We can't say to the enterprises, `From now ondo what you want.' That would destablize the whole economy.''   Petre, a French-trained scientist, said he had been a Marxist,but never a Communist, Le Monde reported.   ``In any case, we are no longer the slaves of any ideology; thatcost us too much,'' he said.   Petre said two of the revolution's key figures, Ion Iliescu whois now president and Gen. Nicolae Militaru, now defense minister,had met several months ago to discuss ``bringing people togetherfor the salvation of the nation,'' the newspaper said.   ``But there was nothing organized, just a few contacts in apark, which besides were recorded by the security police,'' Petrewas quoted as saying.</TEXT></DOC>
