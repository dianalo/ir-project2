The bank holding company said it still is seeking to transfer the pension funds to NCNB Corp., Charlotte, N.C. The company's NCNB Texas National Bank took over First Republic's banks after they were seized by federal regulators as part of a $4 billion bailout.    First RepublicBank -- unrelated to First Republic Bancorp., San Francisco -- filed for Chapter 11 protection in July after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. closed its 41 bank units and transferred them to NCNB. Without the banks, First Republic was left with little to satisfy creditors.    To end wrangling over the overfunded portion of the plans -- estimated to be between $115 million and $200 million -- Congress included a provision in its revision of the tax bill that would divide the excess cash between First Republic and NCNB. An NCNB Texas spokesman said its portion of the funds would remain in the plans. First Republic officials couldn't be reached for comment.    First RepublicBank said if the plans were terminated, it would continue to provide annuities to guarantee the 11,000 covered employees would continue to receive benefits accrued to the termination date. </TEXT></DOC>
