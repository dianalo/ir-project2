The Likud leader spoke of Israel's 40-year fight for existence in the face of Arab enmity, and for the first time Mrs. Eyal, a lifelong Labor voter, found herself agreeing with everything he said. &quot;I turned to my husband and said, 'Moshe, can we do this? Can we vote Likud?'&quot; she recalls.    Like many Israelis, Mrs. Eyal has changed her views since violence erupted in Gaza and the West Bank. &quot;I don't hate Arabs,&quot; she says. &quot;I wasn't raised to hate them. But in the last few months they have shown us their real face.&quot;    Five months into the Palestinian uprising and six months from Israel's general election, the country's mood is overwhelmingly militant. While Israel has earned international disapproval for its shootings and beatings of Palestinian protestors, many Israelis see their response to the stone-throwers as far too restrained. From the Galillee to the Negev, scores of Israelis interviewed in streets, shops and rural settlements echo the call for a stronger hand against Arab demonstrations.    In short, Israelis who have lived in a state of war with their neighbors for more than 40 years see the uprising as just another chapter in a bitter struggle.    The army hasn't yet presented a bill for its hugely expanded policing role. Some analysts estimate it as high, day-to-day, as the costs of the Lebanon war. The cost of replacing Arab labor with better-paid Israelis, and the losses in tax revenue from striking Palestinian businesses, also take a toll on Israel's fragile economy.    But so far, the casualties and the costs aren't enough to panic a war-hardened nation, and in the present Israeli mood the outlook is grim for any peace initiative.    Indeed, underpinning Israeli toughness is a widespread confidence that American support for the Jewish state is unshakable, no matter what policies it pursues. &quot;It's somehow ingrained in Americans to support us,&quot; says Noam Arnon, a 37-year-old student at Ben Gurion University who is in touch almost daily with American colleges through a computer network. In network gossip sessions, he says, &quot;a surprising majority are almost blindly favorable to Israel.&quot; Adds Eva Lazar, a 49-year-old cafe proprietor in Beersheva: &quot;America needs us. We're the only foothold they have in the Middle East.&quot;    Many Israelis had such views confirmed by George Shultz's recent peace mission. Israelis saw Mr. Shamir stonewall the secretary of state's elaborate plan, then watched as President Reagan, only a few days later, seemingly rewarded Mr. Shamir with a five-year cooperation agreement. For the Israeli Labor Party, which plans to focus on the peace issue in its election campaign, a hawkish national mood poses big risks. While Labor leader Shimon Peres appeals to doves with his call for an international peace conference, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin pleases hawks with his blunt call for &quot;force, might, beatings&quot; to quell disturbances.    Labor analysts say that short-term anger about the rioting is matched by a realization that the country needs a negotiated settlement. But while many Israelis say they are ready to talk, deep distrust of Palestinians makes most pessimistic.    What follows are snatches of conversations with Israelis that capture the country's tough and troubled mood:   ---   In a ritual almost as old as the stones of this city, David and Chana Bender kindle Sabbath candles as the Jerusalem sky darkens. From sunset to sunset, like religious Jews throughout the city, they will refrain from all labor. And like most Jews, religious or secular, their conversations turn to the troubled occupied territories.    &quot;The one positive thing about the disturbances,&quot; says 24-year-old Chana, &quot;is that everybody, down to the grubbiest taxi driver, is thinking about all this now. For years no one talked about it.&quot;    Shortly before the riots began, the Benders moved to a city apartment from a kibbutz in the Negev. Since then, although they remain moderates, their views have shifted to the right.    &quot;You see acts of everyday kindness between Arabs and Jews -- like an Arab holding cartons of eggs for an old Jewish man on a crowded bus -- and you feel that some solution must be possible,&quot; says David, a 29-year-old electronics worker. But on other days, the images aren't so benign. Chana was taking a bus to her secretarial job when it was stoned by Arab youths.    Ideally, says David, the Palestinians should get their state and Israel should help it get on its feet with a Marshall Plan-style aid program. &quot;But the bald-faced truth is, whatever we give them, it won't be enough. (Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser) Arafat makes no bones about it when he's talking with his own people: Palestine is all of Israel.&quot;    Asks Chana: &quot;Who do we talk to? If it's the man on the bus holding the eggs I'd feel safer. But what if it's not him? What if it's the man holding the gun?&quot;    ---   From a bench on Tel Aviv's seaside promenade, Eli Billig points to the glittering Mediterranean horizon. &quot;That's where the Arabs want us -- swimming away,&quot; he says.    Mr. Billig, a 29-year-old landscaper, says his right-wing views have hardened since December. &quot;I can see now there's nobody to talk to; they only look to violence,&quot; he says. &quot;If they showed they wanted to start negotiations, my views would move to the left.&quot;    In two weeks Mr. Billig will go to Gaza to do his annual army-reserve duty. &quot;I won't do anything to dishonor my army but if someone throws stones at me I'll give him hell,&quot; he says.    In his view, a wide gulf divides his generation from Israel's early pioneers. &quot;The guys of the Six Day War (of 1967) were saints, idealists,&quot; he says. &quot;The young people today don't grow up on ideals. We don't want to be nice Jewish kids anymore.&quot;    Mr. Billig sees the only prospects for peace in the election of a hard-line leader such as Ariel Sharon. &quot;The Arabs worship power, respect power,&quot; he says. Just as Egypt's Anwar Sadat made peace only when confronted by a militant leader such as Menachem Begin, Mr. Billig reasons, Arabs &quot;would come crawling&quot; to make peace with Mr. Sharon.    &quot;If we had Sharon for our leader they'll say, 'We better not mess with these crazy people.'&quot;    ---   On a warm spring day, Husang and Noori Amini are enjoying a picnic in a Jerusalem park. Husang, a pharmacist, was born in Iran. In the coming November elections, Sephardic Jews, many of whose families originated in Islamic countries, will, for the first time, outnumber voters of European origin. Sephardic Jews tend to be more right-wing and hard-line, and Husang is typical.    &quot;The Arabs are like the people of Iran,&quot; he says. &quot;They don't expect freedom; they don't understand it. In Iran the shah gave the people freedom to demonstrate and it led to his downfall. Here the government should limit Arabs' freedom before things get worse.&quot;    ---   The photographs in the Eyals' Tel Aviv home tell a typically Israeli story. There is a picture of the tailor shop in Germany from which Moshe's family fled in 1935 after Nazis daubed the walls with anti-Semitic slogans. A wedding photo shows Moshe and Israeli-born Yael as young kibbutzniks, their huppa, or traditional Jewish wedding canopy, held aloft by pitchforks and rifles. One wall is devoted to pictures of their son, just 20 years old when he was killed in army service.    Moshe, a 53-year-old industrial-safety adviser, has been to war in the Golan, the Sinai and Beirut. The Eyals haven't decided if they will vote Likud in November for the first time, but their views are moving that way.    &quot;There's no doubt we have the power to cut this thing tomorrow,&quot; says Yael of the Arab uprising. The problem, as Moshe sees it, &quot;is that we are playing a game with two different sets of rules -- the Arabs by Eastern rules, while we try to keep to the rules of the West.&quot;    Neither doubts Israel's ability to ultimately prevail. &quot;We've lived through worse than this,&quot; says Yael. &quot;Much worse.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
