BarnesStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 06/25/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> JWT MERTENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM)MARKETING, ADVERTISING (MKT) </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   JWT Group Inc. said its board would meet as early as today to consider WPP Group PLC's proposed friendly acquisition of JWT and at least one rival bid.    In a statement issued late yesterday, JWT said its board would meet &quot;within 48 hours&quot; to review the WPP offer and &quot;one or more&quot; rival proposals that JWT said it expects to receive before the meeting.    WPP executives met yesterday with JWT officials to discuss WPP's $50.50-a-share, or $515 million, acquisition proposal, a JWT spokesman said. JWT said its directors will review the bid as well as &quot;any improvement&quot; in the offering price that WPP &quot;may communicate to JWT prior to such board meeting.&quot;    A source close to JWT said the statement was intended to signal WPP that JWT believes WPP's offering price should be higher. &quot;This thing (a JWT takeover) is going to be decided on price,&quot; he said. A WPP spokesman declined to comment on whether the London-based marketing services concern is prepared to boost its offer, but WPP has previously said it would be &quot;flexible&quot; in any negotiations with JWT.    As reported previously, JWT directors have said they would consider alternatives to WPP's proposal, including taking the company private in a leveraged buyout, repurchasing JWT shares or seeking a friendly merger partner.    An individual close to JWT said one of the three concerns that had been considering organizing a leveraged buyout of JWT has decided against proposing such a transaction. (Leveraged buyouts typically are transactions financed largely by borrowing; the acquiring company then often pays this debt by selling assets of the acquired company.) The individual declined to elaborate or identify the concern. But individuals have previously said that Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. was one of the three firms.    The individual also said JWT officials met as recently as Tuesday with former executives of Ted Bates Worldwide Inc. about a possible friendly acquisition of JWT. Several Ted Bates officials left the agency last year when it was acquired by Saatchi andamp; Saatchi PLC of Britain.    At the hour-long meeting between JWT and WPP officials yesterday, WPP Chief Executive Officer Martin Sorrell presented WPP's proposal directly to most of JWT's top executives, including Don Johnston, JWT's chairman and chief executive, an individual close to JWT said.    Mr. Sorrell also answered questions from JWT executives. In response to one question, he said he didn't plan to sell the company's Hill andamp; Knowlton Inc. public relations unit if WPP's bid is successful, the individual said.    Meanwhile, individuals close to WPP said WPP likely won't accept JWT's Tuesday offer to provide WPP with extensive non-public information about JWT in return for certain guarantees from WPP. JWT has been providing the information to other interested suitors under certain conditions.    Separately, WPP said it began, as expected, soliciting the consent of other JWT shareholders to remove the advertising company's 11 directors and replace them with six WPP nominees. WPP owns nearly 5% of JWT's about 10 million shares outstanding. </TEXT></DOC>
