(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Westinghouse Electric Co. began its firstfull week of operations at the Savannah River nuclear weapons plantMonday by conceding the difficulty of the task it faces.   But officials at Westinghouse, the world's largest builder ofcommercial nuclear power plants, expressed confidence they would beable to gain public confidence and restart three idle reactors atthe problem-plagued plant.   On Saturday, E.I. du Pont de Nemours andamp; Co. ended 38 years asoperator of the nation's largest nuclear weapons facility, turningthe plant over to Westinghouse Savannah River Co., a subsidiary ofthe Pittsburgh-based parent.   ``We've been convinced that ... we can make this a model ofexcellence,'' Westinghouse Savannah River Co. President James S.Moore said at a news conference Monday.   The Savannah River Plant, which Westinghouse renamed theSavannah River Site, is the nation's only source of tritium, ahighly radioactive gas used at other government defense plants tomake nuclear warheads.   The three active nuclear reactors at the plant have been shutdown for nearly a year because of safety and structural problems,and a series of mishaps in recent months has raised doubts aboutwhether improvements are likely anytime soon.   Moore said a new name and freshly painted signs at the300-square-mile complex near Aiken will not erase the facility'stroubled history.   ``Our first task now that transition is over is to enhance thepublic trust and, obviously, (ensure) a safe restart of thereactors,'' said Moore, whose company has a five-year contract.``The ultimate way to gain trust is to perform. Actions speaklouder than words.''   He stressed that Westinghouse would not jeopardize safety forproduction.   ``We are not putting production ahead of safety, even if theytell us to,'' he said, referring to the federal government.   The Pentagon has said that unless at least one of the reactorsis restarted by the end of the year it might have to deactivatesome warheads to preserve supplies of tritium.   Moore said a clause in the company's contract with theDepartment of Energy ``allows me to go directly to (DOE)headquarters if I feel I'm being told to do something contrary towhat we believe is right or safe.''   ``My view is that if I have to do that, I've failed on my jobbecause I've failed to communicate with my customer here at thesite.''   Moore also said he would shut down the reactors if the EnergyDepartment asked for more tritium than could be produced safely inthe alotted time.   The DOE has tied the amount of money Westinghouse will be paidto how well it performs.</TEXT></DOC>
