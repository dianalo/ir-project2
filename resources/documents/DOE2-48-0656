As a consequence, materials which have previously been rejectedfor use in certain applications are once again being considered. Suchis the current case involving the use of quenched and tempered low alloyfor Cr Mo steels for pressure vessel construction. When heat treatedin this manner this material produces a bainitic microstructure whichhas improved short term strength characteristics over the more commonlyused annealed form. It has been found, however, that the bainitic microstructuresoftens significantly under cyclic loading. As a result, for determiningallowable design stresses, a criteria needs to be developed to judgewhether use of the fully heat treated strength is justified, or whetherit is necessary to take into consideration a softened state of the material.To gain an understanding of the limiting stress/strain range which willinduce significant softening, a time dependent uniaxial constitutivemodel of strain induced softening has been developed. This model wasformulated from a given set of elevated temperature cyclic test results.In this model strain induced softening is postulated to be a functionof accumulated plastic strain. Predictions made using this model arecompared with results obtained experimentally.</TEXT></DOC>
