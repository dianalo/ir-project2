PostsLoss of $1.3 MillionFor '87 Fiscal Year</HL><DD> 08/27/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> DCOREARNINGS (ERN) </IN><DATELINE> COLUMBUS, Ohio  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Decor Corp., citing suspected employee theft of inventory and computer-system problems, posted a net loss of $1.3 million for the year ended May 30.    In fiscal 1986, the operator of graphicart and card stores earned $601,000, or 31 cents a share, adjusted for a 5% stock dividend paid in January.    Sales increased 43% to $21.1 million from $14.7 million.    Bob Binsky, Decor chairman, said that about 30 employees have been fired as a result of suspected theft at the company's card and gift stores.    &quot;We have changed about 90% of the managers,&quot; he said, either because of suspected theft, or because of failure to monitor inventory adequately. Mr. Binsky said approximately $700,000 of inventory losses were related to suspected theft. Decor didn't detect the problem until inventories were conducted last spring.    &quot;It took us by surprise,&quot; Mr. Binsky said. &quot;Even after we saw the numbers, we didn't believe it.&quot;    Mr. Binsky said the company also had problems with a new computer system that gave inflated readings of inventory. He said &quot;glitches&quot; accounted for about $300,000 of losses.    Decor said it is beefing up inventory controls and expects &quot;positive results&quot; during the second half of the current fiscal year.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Decor shares closed at $4, unchanged. </TEXT></DOC>
