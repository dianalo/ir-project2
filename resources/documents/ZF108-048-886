 The move is on to cooperative processing, as epitomized by the IBMSystems Application Architecture (SAA) direction.andP;  The new course is risky,by virtue of its newness.andM;Cooperative processing is defined as the capability of an application to runon multiple computers connected in a network, such that the processing cyclesexecute in the most appropriate location.andP;  It is division of labor, dividedaccording to the strength of each player.andM;In this model, the front or workstation end of an application provides dataentry, validation, display and output formatting services.andP;  The host endprovides database services, data sharing facilities, integrity, and securityand remote connectivity.andP;  Some functions, such as computation, may occur onall participants in the application.andM;Cooperative processing can be viewed as the latest point in a technology thahas evolved from punch cards to timesharing systems to teleprocessingmonitors with online mainframe access.andP;  Today's large terminal networks havea batch heritage, which most reveal through their 80-column screen format.andM;Since PCs were born in the early 1980s, local area networks of PCs havebecome increasingly reliable and functional.andP;  File transfer programs andmicro-mainframe links have enabled the sharing of data between the PC andhost.andP;  The next stage is more cooperative processing, which has been pursuedby several independent software suppliers for some time.andP;  With SAA, IBM isproviding a more specific definition of how it intends to implementcooperative processing.andM;TALKING VIA PROTOCOLSandM;The protocols used exchange messages between programs are the vital&quot;language&quot; of cooperative processing.andP;  Protocols vary depending on thenetwork environment and the computers involved.andP;  For example, IBM uses aprotocol called LU 6.2 to provide PC to mainframe links on a Token-Ringnetwork, and a protocol called HLLAPI (high-level language applicationprogramming interface) on 3270 networks.andM;Microsoft LAN Manager uses a protocol called Named Pipes for this function toconnect to SQL Server, from Sybase, Inc. of emeryville, Calif.f IBM uses aprotocol called Netbios to connect to OS/2 extended Edition data Manager.andO;Coding programs that use these protocols is a relatively complex task, whichbecomes easier with repetition.andM;Cooperative processing is being motivated by a push to simplify the usabilityof complex applications, with PCs as a primary means of doing so.andM;Despite products such as the early Microsoft Windows and the unsuccessful IBMTopView, the early user interface to PC programs was not dramatically betterthan its mainframe brethren.andM;The Macintosh proved that a properly designed graphical user interface canresult in greater user productivity, lower training costs, and fewer errors.andM;Today, the same amount of money that bought an IBM PC in 1981 can buy a PC atleast 20 times as powerful--more power than required for the word processingand spreadsheet tasks that have been mainstay PC applications.andM;Much of this power is going toward simplifying the user interaction withprograms.andP;  PCs using a new generation of Microsoft Windows-based products andOS/2 Presentation Manager are beginning to offer benefits similar to those ofthe Macintosh.andM;While, in principle, host-based applications could support the use ofgraphical user interfaces (GUIs) on terminals, the volume of network trafficand other host processing would make the additional GUI overhead too costlyto incur.andP;  Even X Windows, a technology designed to let special X Windowsterminals support GUI-based applications running on the host, is not likelyto match the efficiency of the cooperative processing model.andM;Recognizing the benefits of a GUI, IBM made OS/2 Presentation Manager anintegral part of the SAA specification for the common user access (CUA).andO;While a CUA specification exists for non-programmable terminals (dumbterminals) and a text-oriented CUA, IBM's use of Presentation Manager as amain environment for OfficeVision indicates tha the future is in GUIs.andM;THE MULTI SOFT SOLUTIONandM;One of the first tools to provide cooperative processing facilities betweenPCs and IBM mainframes is the product family from Multi Soft, Inc.,andO;Lawrenceville, N.J.andM;According to Charles Lombardo, chief executive officer, Multi Soft's productaddress three levels of need in cooperative processing.andM;First is the need for providing a CUA-complaint front end to an application.andO;Multi Soft's Infront/DS and Easy SAA capture 3270 screens and convert them toSAA-compliant screens that will run on a PC connected to the mainframethrough a 3270 line.andM;Because they map the 3270 screen definition into the PC screen, and do thetranslation at teh PC, 3270s can continue to run in parallel with the PCs.andM;Multi Soft recognizes that many users are not ready to abandon their 3270sand 3270 network and replace it with a Token-Ring network.andP;  Presently thefirm's products support text-oriented CUA, not the full GUI functions.andM;Multi Soft's Infront/DS product also provides a fourth-generation languageand local data validation capability.andP;  However, it is often difficult to keepdata synchronized when data validation tables are stored locally as well ason the host.andM;The Infront/Software Distribution Facility (SDF) addresses this issue byautomatically keeping local validation data consistent with the host version.andO;This provides Lombardo's second level of functionality.andM;The third level is to support complete transaction processing between themainframe host and PC front end.andP;  Infront/Host Processing Option (HPO) addsthis functionality.andP;  As with DS, HPO does not require an LU 6.2 network, butuses LU 2 on the existing 3270 network.andM;Management Science America, an Atlanta-based vendor of accounting and otherapplications software, is converting its applications to cooperativeprocessing with the help of the Multi Soft tools.andM;The first round of SAA-compliant products is called Bright View.andP;  Accordingto Brain Cohen, vice president of technology, MSA replaced 3270 screens withtext-based CUA screens and some local validation capability.andP;  In addition toan interface, a local help function assists users in learning the product.andM;MSA's developers have found the move to cooperative processing to be acomplex undertaking, Cohen said.andP;  Simly moving to a PC with CUA screens andsome local validation--while an improvement--is just a first step.andP;  Mostlarge applications that have been well-designed for a centralized hostenvironment may need to be completely redesigned to take full advantage ofthe benefits of cooperative processing.andM;MSA views the current release of BrightView as an important first step inbasing their product on what will be the central technology of the '90s.andM;By its investment in the company, IBM has endorsed the Easel product fromInteractive Images, Woburn, Mass., as a stepping stone into SAA cooperativeprocessing from the world of existing mainframe applications accessed by 3270terminals.andP;  Easel allows developers to write CUA-compliant workstation frontends to host applications, without requiring modification of host code.andM;At the SAA World meeting sponsored by Digital Consulting, Inc., Andover,Mass., in Chicago recently, IBM's Bob Berland, vice president of theApplications Division, pointed to Easel as the primary SAA deliverable on themarket today.andM;THE CLIENT-SERVER SUBSETandM;Client-server computing is a particularly important subset of coopeativeprocessing, in which designated nodes provide specific services such as datamanagement, communications, or printing to requesting nodes.andM;A network may contain multiple servers of the same or different types.andO;Initially, this style of computing was found on networks of workstations suchas those from Sun Microsystems, Inc., Mountain View, Calif.andP;  Today,client-server achitecture has spread to all networked environments.andM;One of the most important type of servers has become the database server.andP;  Inthis approach, the database resides on a general-purpose computer dedicatedto providing database services to a collection of client computers.andP;  Theclient computer sends a command string, usually SQL-based, to the back endwhere it is translated, and the database request satisfied.andP;  The reply, whichmay be a message, or data, or both, is sent to the client computer.andM;There it is formatted and manipulated by the front-end tools.andP;  The advantageof a database server, when compared to a file server, is that it sends onlythe data needed to satisfy a database request.andP;  For example, in anorder-entry database, a request for the total value of orders by a customerusing a file server might require many megabytes of data to be shipped acrossthe network; whereas a database server would require only the total to besent to the client.andM;The release of the SQL Server by Sybase popularized the idea of databaseserver computing.andM;Sybase introduced an important element to database servers--the storedprocedure.andP;  Stored procedures are collections of SQL statements knittedtogether with a procedural language.andP;  Cooperative processing has opened upaccess to the database using tools such as spreadsheets.andM;However, these tools do not normally provide for editing input data to thedatabase.andP;  The DBMS must be able to protect itself from changes that cancorrupt the integrity of the data.andP;  Triggers provide a mechanism for doingthis.andP;  Triggers are a particular type of stored procedure that is invokedwhen the database is altered.andM;Other vendors, such as Interbase of Burlington, Mass., and Ingres Corp.andO;(formerly Relational Technology) of Alameda, Calif., have added storedprocedures, and Oracle of Belmont, Calif., has promised to include them aspart of Oracle release 7 (scheduled to be out toward the end of 1990).andP;  IBMhas provided little information so far about the role of stored procedures inthe DBMS or development tools in the SAA family.andP;  (See related story on IBMRepository Manager on page 59.)andM;SQL Server provides a cooperative processing solution on a variety ofcomputers including Sun, VAX (under VMS and Unix), Stratus, Pyramid, and PCsunder OS/2.andM;Sybase recently announced what it calls the open server, which will provideconnectivity to other hosts and DBMSs, such as IBM mainframes running DB2.andO;The Sybase open server uses remote procedure call (RPC) routines.andP;  The RPCroutines send a call in a specific format to a process on a remote computer,which services the call and sends the data back.andP;  This process may just goagainst a DBMS, or it may be part of an application, such as electronic mail.andM;Sun Microsystems is also working with independent database suppliers tospread the client-server architecture through its customer base.andP;  Sun'srecently announced NetIsam tool can be used to make the transition from Isamproducts that allow local access to data, to software that lets users accessand store files located anywhere on a Sun network.andM;NetIsam was designed for the client-server model, in which applicationsreside on client workstations and shared data resides on one or more servers.andO;Sun is careful on say it is not in the database business, since it has closerelations with Oracle, Ingres Corp., Informix, and Sybase.andP;  Sun may seek toreach agreements with suppliers of fourth-generation languages, such asInformation Builders, Inc., New York, and Cognos Corp., Ottawa, to have theirproducts run on Sun networks, according to Nancy Colwell, manager of databasedevelopment marketing for Sun.andM;WITH CL/1, APPLE IS A PLAYERandM;Apple Computer, Inc., Cupertino, Calif., is also eager to provide thebenefits of cooperative processing to people developing applications on AppleMacs.andP;  To that end, Apple acquired Network Innovations of Cupertino.andP;  Thecompany's CL/1 product is designed to provide connectivity to host SQL-basedDBMSs.andM;Lance Hoffman, Apple's product manager for CL/1, says that such databaseconnectivity is essential for Apple to properly support the corporate MISfunction.andM;In its initial release, expected to ship by year-end, CL/1 will support thefollowing VAX/VMS databases: DEC's own Rdb, Oracle, Ingres, and Informix.andM;CL/1 is also expected to support the DB2 and SQL/DS IBM mainframe DBMSs.andO;About 15 software vendors have announced that they will support CL/1,including: Informix with its WingZ spreadsheet; Andyne of Kensington,Ontario, with its SQL query product GQL; Odesta Corp. of Northbrook, Ill.,andO;with its DBMS Double Helix; and Microsoft of Redmond, Wash.andM;A feather in Apple's cap is the recent addition of Morris Taradalsky to itsstaff.andP;  Taradalsky, the former head of IBM's Santa Teresa Laboratories, wasintimately involved in the formulation of IBM's Repository Manager and Caseproduct strategy under the SAA umbrella.andM;Information Builders Inc. is a company that has long provided connectivitybetween its Focus 4GL and virtually every major DBMS on the market.andP;  So itseems natural that IBI should move into the cooperative processing arena.andM;Based on its Focnet Product, Focus will be able to both read and write DB2 orSQL/DS on an IBM mainframe host from a DOS client, and provide read access tonon-SQL databases on the host.andM;The host will also need a copy of Focus that is mapped into the other DBMS.andO;Of particular interest is its ability to combine data from remote and localdatabases.andP;  While this does not provide the optimization that a truedistributed database would, it nevertheless provides an important incrementof functionality.andM;While the current version of Focus supports a window painter, it is notCUA-compliant.andP;  However, IBI intends to provide that capability in its OS/2Presentation Manager version of Focus.andM;Gupta Technologies of Melo Park, Calif., is one of the first companies toprovide cooperative processing between a PC and an IBM host running DB2.andO;And, with SQLWindows, it is one of the few to provide a tool for building aclient application using Microsoft Windows.andP;  Using Gupta's SQLNet product, aPC LAN can use LU 6.2 to connect to CICS on the mainframe, and then to DB2.andM;Gupta recently announced version 4.0 of SQLBase Server, which will extend theproduct to the Sun Unix-based systems when it ships in the first quarter of1990.andP;  Version 4.0 will also run on the Sun sparc line.andP;  The product supportsTCP/IP protocols; Open Network Computering/Network File System (ONC/NFS)support is planned.andP;  The product also allows a PC LAN user to use a Sunmachine as a database server, the vendor said.andM;Andy Moss, director of distributed services for PVM Computing in New York, isbuilding a large application using SQLWindows and the C language on PCs,connecting through Banyan's LAN to a host mainframe.andM;PVM chose a cooperative processing solution for the advantages of a betterinterface resulting in lower training costs and improved ease of use, andbetter performance stemming from local editing and validation.andM;Moss says the hardest problem in cooperative processing is not technical butorganizational.andP;  Large mainframe shops have bureaucracies designed to protectthe ongoing operations of the MIS function.andP;  To hook into DB2, Moss needs towork with a Vtam group, a CICS group, and the DB2 group.andM;Because the mainframe culture is one in which stability is a guidingprinciple, those responsible for mainframes tend to be conservative and donot move as fast as PC LAN people might like.andP;  Also, jobs andresponsibilities on the mainframe tend to be more well-defined than those ofPC network administrators.andM;According to Moss, the most difficult technical problem has been theconnectivity issue.andP;  Software and hardware from numerous vendors have to beintegrated, which almost always causes unexpected problems.andM;Despite his mainframe background, Moss finds that using cooperativeprocessing in PC environments simplifies life.andM;For users who need to analyze data from mainframe databases on their PCs onan ad hoc basis, writing programs is not an appropriate solution.andP;  For themand others with similar requirements, Micro Decisionware of Boulder, Colo.,andO;has a cooperative processing solution.andM;PC/SQL-link is a menu-based system that will guide users in creating an SQLrequest.andP;  The product will fetch the data from the mainframe and convert itto any of a wide range of PC formats, including Lotus 1-2-3, Microsoft Excel,Ashton-Tate's dBase, and Paradox from Borland International, Scotts Valley,Calif.andM;PC/SQL-link provides connectivity across many different networks to a largevariety of host computers.andP;  It supports IBM mainframces with DB2 and SQL/DSon both advanced program-to-program communications (APPC) networks and 3270networks, as well as connecting to Tandem, Bull, and Teradata.andM;It is clear that cooperative processing will soon impact most mainframe usersand users of PC LANs.andM;As cooperative processing applications proliferate, the integration andcommunication issues will become smoother, and standards for connectivitywill begin to emerge.andP;  The degree of transparency that now exists in amainframe centralized application will migrate to PC/mainframe cooperativeapplications.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
