The head of his32-man personal guard suddenly came into the study toannounce the arrival of an unidentified group of people&quot;demanding&quot; a meeting. It was 4:50 p.m., Sunday, August 18.   Who invited them? asked a startled Mr. Gorbachev. Therewere no appointments on his calendar, and strict security wasin effect. Why were they let in? The guard explained thatthey were accompanied by Yuri Plekhanov -- the powerful headof the state security guard, an elite arm of the KGB.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Gorbachev instantly reached for a phone. The line wasdead. He tried a second, also dead. He frantically tried themall.   Then he knew. The event he must have feared from the dayhe launched a revolution six years ago under the banner ofperestroika had finally come. In the balance hung all he hadworked for, as well as his own life.   He left his office and summoned his wife, Raisa, and hisdaughter, Irina. He told them that no matter what happened,&quot;I will stick to my position to the end&quot; and will &quot;not stepback, not under any pressure, blackmail or threats.&quot; Hisfamily gave him their support. They knew that their lives,too, might be at stake.   &quot;I didn't need any new information,&quot; Mr. Gorbachev told aMoscow press conference yesterday. &quot;I knew that a veryserious event was going on, that they {his visitors} wouldeither blackmail me or there would be attempts to arrest meor take me away somewhere. Basically, anything could happen.&quot;   After his ordeal, told here in his words, Mr. Gorbachevwas pale and seemed clearly shaken. At the press conferencethere were long pauses in his delivery as he appeared tosearch for words. He seemed almost overcome by emotion. Hisanswers to questions were rambling and indirect. But hisnarrative -- of the 72 hours in which one of the world's twomost powerful men was held in captivity by members of his owngovernment -- was coherent and gripping.   He sent his family and a contingent of guards to distantrooms in one of the two rambling dachas that serve as thepresident's vacation headquarters. Located on the southerntip of the Cri-mean peninsula, the dachas were built for Mr.Gorbachev two years ago in a secluded area near the sea.   Then Mr. Gorbachev prepared to receive the mysteriousdelegation. But before he could summon them, they burst intohis room, led by Valery Boldin, his chief of staff. Boldingave him an ultimatum: transfer his power to Vice PresidentGennady Yanayev.   Mr. Gorbachev avoided a direct answer and managed toengage his captors in a surprisingly extended discussion ofpolitics. Who sent them? he demanded. &quot;The State Committeefor the State of the Emergency in the country,&quot; theyanswered. &quot;Who created it?&quot; Mr. Gorbachev replied,continuing, &quot;I didn't create it, the Supreme Soviet didn'tcreate it.&quot;   They insisted that the &quot;people had already united&quot; andwanted a presidential decree transferring powers to Mr.Yanayev. The country was nearing catastrophe, and &quot;weshouldn't daydream anymore,&quot; one said.   &quot;I told them that I knew the situation in the countrybetter than anyone,&quot; Mr. Gorbachev said, &quot;politically,economically, and the life of people and all the difficultiesthey were facing, and that we had come to the phase where weneed to do everything as fast and decisively as we can tolive better.&quot; He denounced the use of violence and terror infervent tones. &quot;I was always an opponent of such methods, notonly because of political and moral reasons, but because inthe history of our country they have always led to the deathof hundreds, thousands and millions . . . everything that westarted we'll have to bury forever. We should agree that weare going in a bloody circle.&quot;   Then Mr. Gorbachev seized the offensive. &quot;You and thosewho sent you are adventurists. You will kill yourselves, butthe hell with you. Do what you want to do, but you will alsokill the country.&quot;   These words had no effect. Mr. Boldin again demanded hisresignation.   &quot;You won't get that from me,&quot; Mr. Gorbachev replied. &quot;Tellthat to the people who sent you.&quot;   The delegation, which apparently included several seniormilitary and KGB officers, withdrew without achieving itsgoal, leaving Mr. Gorbachev, his family and his 32-manpresidential guard and their machine guns. The guards pledgedtheir loyalty, agreeing to stay until the end.   The dacha was encircled by troops under the command of thestate committee, and all roads in the vicinity were blockedby armed guards, according to Stepan Kisilyov, a Sovietjournalist who tried to get close. Gorbachev was, as he putit, subjected to &quot;full isolation from land and sea.&quot; Hisyoung granddaughter wasn't even allowed to go down to thebeach.   Though he was convinced that his captors were trying towear down his resistance, Mr. Gorbachev fought back byissuing new demands, &quot;every day, morning and evening.&quot; Hedemanded that communications be re-established, that a planebe sent to take him back to Moscow and that the statecommittee refute its statement about his health.   His will to resist was also strengthened by the fact thathe wasn't as isolated as his captors believed. Some of hisguards found some old radio receivers. They rigged upantennae and managed to receive broadcasts from the BritishBroadcasting Corporation, Radio Liberty and the Voice ofAmerica. He learned that he was described by the plotters as&quot;ill, seriously,&quot; and &quot;that I was not capable of returning toa normal life.&quot;   The lies hit home. &quot;I was struck to the bones andindignant with the political blindness and irresponsibilityof these criminals,&quot; Mr. Gorbachev recalled. To refute thelies -- for history, if nothing else -- he prepared astatement attesting to his good health and the illegality ofthe coup and signed it with his distinctive signature. Healso filmed a short statement. Both were entrusted to loyalaides. Evidently fearful of poison or drugs, he and hisfamily and entourage rebuffed all food offered from outsidethe dacha, eating only what remained from stocks accumulatedbefore the coup.   As time passed and the broadcasts continued, hisconfidence grew. He learned that reporters had laughed at thecommittee's assertions that he was ill. He heard that thehands of the coup plotters had trembled as they read theirdecrees. He learned that his onetime rival Boris Yeltsin wasstaring down the tanks and calling for his return. &quot;It won'tlast long, and it won't succeed,&quot; he concluded.   He was right. As the coup fell apart, three members of theeight-man state committee, including Defense Minister MarshalDmitri Yazov and KGB chief Vladimir Kryuchkov, two men whomMr. Gorbachev had trusted and promoted, flew down to theCrimea to seek an audience with him, apparently to ask for apardon.   The president indignantly refused, saying, &quot;I won't talkto any of them until all the government communications arere-established,&quot; he said. That would take some time, he wastold. &quot;Never mind,&quot; Mr. Gorbachev replied, his sense of humorreturning. &quot;I'm in no hurry to get anywhere.&quot; Evidentlydespairing of any alternative, the conspirators soon restoredthe phone lines.   Mr. Gorbachev's first phone call was to Mr. Yeltsin, whomMr. Gorbachev now recognized as the hero of the moment. Hefollowed up with calls to the leaders of other republics.   In fact, he had already prepared the groundwork for hisresumption of power. He wrote a statement condemning theCommittee's coup, and made a tape-recording of it in the hopethat he could get it to Moscow. Even before the coup leadersarrived, he had telephoned Mikhail Moiseyev, chief of theGeneral Staff, and ordered him to take charge of the Sovietarmy and tell Mr. Yazov he was fired and about to bearrested.   Mr. Gorbachev remained at the dacha, concerned that hemight still be in danger. While he waited for assurances thatit was safe to return to Moscow, calls from world leaderspoured in: Messrs. Bush, Mitterrand, Kohl, Major, Mulroney,Kaifu, Mubarak.   Then his liberators arrived: Russia's Vice PresidentAlexander Rutskoi and Prime Minister Ivan Silayev,accompanied by a 40-strong delegation of guards and Russianparliamentary deputies. A second delegation, consisting ofthree close Gorbachev aides, arrived soon after. They werewelcomed by Mr. Gorbachev in an emotional reunion.   All quickly ascertained that the president was in goodhealth except for a touch of recurring back trouble and highblood pressure. A few hours later, at 2:30 a.m., Thursday,August 22, the presidential plane carrying Mr. Gorbachev, hiswife, Raisa, loyal guards and Mr. Yeltsin's colleaguestouched down in Moscow. The ordeal was over.   The coup leaders also made their way back to the Sovietcapital under armed guard. As they stepped off the plane inMoscow, they were immediately arrested. &quot;Soviet societyrejected Putschists,&quot; Mr. Gorbachev said, praising theunyielding determination of Russian President Boris Yeltsinand the Russian people. Now it was the turn of theringleaders to be isolated.</TEXT></DOC>
