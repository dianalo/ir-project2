This bid may be more successful than the last two, however. Though the estate of James M. Crosby, Resorts' late founder and chairman, has rejected Pratt's $100-a-share and $125-a-share offers to buy its Class B shares, a source close to the transaction said the estate and Mr. Crosby's relatives have indicated they might be willing to sell to take advantage of the capital gains tax laws that will change after Dec. 31. Some family members have indicated in the past that they would be willing to sell their stakes at the right price.    The estate owns 340,783 of the 752,000 Class B shares outstanding, which have 100 times the voting rights of Class A shares. As a result, the estate's block represents a 44% voting control of the Atlantic City, N.J.-based company.    The estate's and family's decision would be contingent on their financial adviser, Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., determining that the offer was a fair one. Merrill Lynch recently completed an evaluation of the value of Class B shares, but the results of the evaluation weren't immediately known.    The tender offer, which expires Dec. 29, is contingent on 51% of the Class B shares being tendered. An advertisement announcing the offer appeared in editions of today's Wall Street Journal.    Jack E. Pratt Sr., chairman of the Dallas-based hotel and casino concern, declined to comment on the offer.    A spokesman for Resorts declined to comment on the offer, and executives of the Crosby estate couldn't be reached for comment.    Though other potential bidders for Resorts have emerged, Pratt appears to be the most serious and persistent suitor. Hans Wambach, president of Seatex Group Inc., proposed buying the estate's Class B stock for $180 a share in a letter to the estate's representatives. In addition, Michael Peloquin, a Phoenix, Ariz., real estate developer, said he has offered &quot;substantially more&quot; than $125 a share for the estate's Class B shares. Both bids were disclosed in court papers related to shareholder lawsuits, but neither bidder has elaborated on his offer.    Pratt, which has said it wants to expand its hotel and casino operations, currently owns the Sands Hotel andamp; Casino in Atlantic City and could own as many as three casinos there under New Jersey law. The company has financial backing from Southmark Corp., a Dallas-based financial services and real estate concern that owns 37% of Pratt's shares.    Resorts' Class B stock closed Friday in American Stock Exchange composite trading at $119 a share, up $7. </TEXT></DOC>
