The red-cheeked, 43-year-old Romanenko said he had just comeback from a vacation in Kislovodsk, where he had been doingpush-ups and other exercises to readjust his body to gravity after11 months of weightlessness.   Romanenko, who returned to Earth on Dec. 29, said there wereItalian news reports that he suffered ill health effects from theflight, and he wanted to disprove them.   ``I feel fine,'' he declared.   A Soviet space medical specialist and other space officials atthe news conference agreed that Romanenko, the mission commander,was in good shape.   Romanenko also assured reporters that a fellow spaceman was inno serious danger when pressure in his spacesuit suddenly droppedduring a 3-hour, 40-minute spacewalk on April 12, 1987.   Cosmonaut Alexander Laveikin and Romanenko had embarked on thespacewalk to learn why their orbital space station Mir was not ableto dock properly with a laboratory module called Kvant.   Romanenko said a lever switched in the incorrect position causeda loss of air pressure in Laveikin's spacesuit. Asked if thedepressurization was life-threatening, he responded, ``There wasnothing particularly scary about it.''   He said normally the suit should be kept at 0.45 atmosphericunits but the level dropped to 0.35 because a lever that controlspressure was set incorrectly.   Romanenko said the cosmonaut contacted mission controllers inthe Soviet Union, who transmitted a command to regulate thepressure and ``within moments the pressure was back to normal, thatis 0.45.''   On the spacewalk, Laveikin and Romanenko found what waspreventing Mir from docking with the Kvant module: an ``alienobject'' had gotten into the docking unit. Romanenko said Thursdaythe object was a cloth bag containing ``hygenic devices.''   The cosmonauts removed the bag and mission controllers sent asignal that successfully docked Mir and Kvant. Soviet scientistshad tried for a week to rescue the 11-ton Kvant, which is used toconduct a variety of experiments, including those in biotechnologyand astrophysics.</TEXT></DOC>
