James P. Owen of NWQ Investment Management Inc. is getting first crack at landing the job, but he rates his chances as mixed.    &quot;These guys are Harvard and Yale conservative,&quot; Mr. Owen says just before making his sales pitch to the lawyers. &quot;I grew up in Kentucky, and I have a Southern twang. I have on a Bijan suit that they'll hate, and I'm from an LA firm, which to these guys is la-la land. So we'll see.&quot;    In the fiercely competitive world of money management -- where few managers outshine the pack for long -- salesmanship, clothes, accents and patter can tip the balance between landing and losing an account. Enter Mr. Owen: a &quot;rainmaker,&quot; one of a breed of polished salesmen who drum up accounts for money management firms.    &quot;The business of money management is not managing other people's money; it's the business of getting other people's money to manage,&quot; says money management consultant Budge Collins.    George Hambrecht, another industry consultant, says, &quot;It's gotten to the point to where the marketing is up to 75% of the business equation.&quot;    Highly successful money managers have doubled as polished salesmen for a long time. Witness John Templeton and David Dreman, among others. But such combination investment-and-marketing gurus are rare; many top stock and bond pickers loathe having to become involved in selling their services, and are happy to turn over the chore to professional salesmen.    Salesmen such as NWQ's Mr. Owen. After stints in advertising and several securities firms, Mr. Owen took his big career gamble in 1982 by joining fledgling NWQ, formed a few months earlier by two insurance company portfolio managers. (The firm's name comes from &quot;northwest quadrant,&quot; jargon in the investment management business for firms producing high returns with low risk.) The gamble proved a winner. NWQ has ballooned from less than $100 million under management to $2 billion today. Well-known in the industry for a soft-spoken though persistent sales approach, Mr. Owen is credited with putting NWQ on the map. NWQ's investment record has been good, but &quot;without marketing, the firm today would be about half its size,&quot; says David A. Polak, NWQ's founding partner and investment head.    For his efforts, which also include keeping current clients informed and happy, the 48-year-old Mr. Owen earns nearly $2 million a year. That allows him to indulge what he calls his one &quot;vanity&quot; -- shopping regularly at the New York and Beverly Hills branches of Bijan, a reservations-only clothing boutique where ties are priced at $175 and coats run $2,000.    Mr. Owen has little direct role in the investment process. He usually visits NWQ's Los Angeles office one day a month, though he talks by phone daily with Mr. Polak, the investment head. Mr. Owen operates out of his Denver home to cut flying time to reach scattered sales prospects.    He enjoys his independence. &quot;It would have never worked if I was in LA,&quot; he says. &quot;I'm a loner, not a team player.&quot;    Mr. Owen is religious about cultivating the media. Several reporters at this newspaper, for instance, have quoted him frequently over the years. He has just written a book about his investment ideas. And he is tickled to have his house, decorated by his wife, Stanya, an avid antique collector, featured on the cover of a recent Colorado lifestyles magazine.    &quot;If you let me get my foot in the door,&quot; he says, &quot;I'll get further than any other guy could. I always wanted to be at the rainmaker level. That's what I am: I'm a rainmaker.&quot;    His success at NWQ wasn't instant. At first, he targeted 25 big corporate pension funds he thought promising clients. But only a lucky few managers get their phone calls answered, much less see the inside of a pension fund executive's office. Six months of effort landed Mr. Owen a handful of interviews, but no business.    His worst moment came during a presentation to Robert Evans, head of Xerox Corp.'s big pension plan. Mr. Owen was in mid-sentence when Mr. Evans fell asleep. &quot;I tiptoed out of the room so as not to wake him up,&quot; says Mr. Owen. &quot;Right then, I said there has to be a better way.&quot; (Mr. Evans recalls meeting Mr. Owen, though he is not sure about the nap. &quot;Maybe I dozed off. I don't know,&quot; he says through a Xerox spokesman.)    Mr. Owen decided to aim at pools of money between $1 million and $100 million -- often considered not worth the trouble by big-time investment advisers. NWQ's conservative investment style -- avoiding stocks that swing sharply in price and sometimes shunning stocks for bonds -- clicked with this group. &quot;Jim found a whole market for us we didn't know was there,&quot; says E.C. &quot;Ted&quot; Friedel, another NWQ partner.    In New Haven, Mr. Owen, sitting ramrod straight, makes his pitch before five Wiggin andamp; Dana partners around a conference table. It's one of about 100 formal sales presentations he will make to prospective clients each year, and one of thousands that competitors at the other 1,500 or so big-time U.S. money managers make annually to pension funds, endowments and, increasingly, to wealthy individuals.    Mr. Owen got his foot in the door at Wiggin andamp; Dana with an introduction from Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. broker Martin DeGennaro. The law firm is one of Mr. DeGennaro's best clients, not only for the money the lawyers have to invest directly, but for their New Haven contacts. (&quot;There is a lot of old trust money here, and these guys can get you to that as well as anybody,&quot; the Shearson broker says. &quot;In fact, they are the only way to get to it.&quot;)    But the partners were unhappy with how their profit-sharing money was doing under a Shearson in-house portfolio manager, and other investment firms caught the scent. &quot;I knew I had to get on my horse because they are bringing in Merrill Lynch to do a comparative performance evaluation,&quot; Mr. DeGennaro says.    Thus the call to Mr. Owen, who often gets leads on sales prospects from stockbrokers serving as &quot;consultants&quot; for clients seeking independent money managers. For introducing the client and monitoring the account, the broker-consultant shares part of the money management fee or some of the trading commissions generated by the account.    Mr. Owen stresses his firm's conservative investment philosophy and its devotion to client service. He drops in several references to Gibson, Dunn andamp; Crutcher, a big law firm in California that is a NWQ client, winning nods of recognition. The session ends without commitments, but there is talk of a follow-up meeting, the best that Mr. Owen had hoped for.    &quot;Your presentation went very well,&quot; Mr. DeGennaro tells Mr. Owen in the elevator. &quot;I know these guys well enough to know.&quot;    Mr. Owen is skeptical. &quot;That's tough work,&quot; he says out of earshot of Mr. DeGennaro. Asked his chances of landing the lawyers' business, Mr. Owen says, &quot;I wouldn't rate the probabilities too high.&quot;    Mr. Owen is more upbeat about his next presentation -- to New York accountant Charles J. Brucia, whose clients include show-business executives and rock stars with sky-rocketing incomes.    &quot;Clients listen to their lawyers, but they obey their accountants,&quot; observes Pittsford, N.Y., money manager Geoffrey Rosenberger.    &quot;They're in the entertainment business, so there's a connection with LA,&quot; Mr. Owen says before meeting Mr. Brucia. Among NWQ's biggest clients are the pension plans of the Directors Guild of America (for whom NWQ manages $118 million) and the Motion Picture Industry ($97 million), which Mr. Owen says he will make a point of mentioning.    NWQ's conservative investment style strikes a responsive chord with Mr. Brucia, who says he is most comfortable with investing in risk-free Treasury securities. &quot;Most of my clients are nouveau riches who are scared to death&quot; of losing their capital through bad investments, the accountant explains.    Mr. Owen, relaxed on a couch in Mr. Brucia's office with a foot propped on a glass coffee table, pounds home the safety theme. The real question, he says, is this: &quot;Do you want spectacular performance, or do you want consistent performance? No manager can do both.&quot;    Mr. Owen makes no promises. (&quot;The mistake that most guys make in this business is that they sell a product that they know they can't deliver,&quot; he says later.) But he suggests that NWQ should produce annual returns averaging 12% or more over two or three years.    On the street below the accountant's office, Mr. Owen gushes about how receptive Mr. Brucia was. &quot;I'd be very surprised if we didn't do business with that guy,&quot; he says.    Mr. Brucia, however, isn't so sure. &quot;He was pretty nice, but there are other money manager types that had a lot more to offer than he did,&quot; he says. The accountant adds that he might recommend Mr. Owen &quot;if we get a client that fits his makeup.&quot;    As for the Wiggin andamp; Dana account, the jury is still out on the law firm's choice of a new manager. &quot;He hasn't been eliminated,&quot; Wiggin andamp; Dana partner John Barnett says of Mr. Owen. The firm has interviewed other candidates, and plans to see still more before reaching a decision.    Mr. Owen is philosophical about it all. Closing a sale can take several weeks or months, he notes. Another call is expected to net a $10 million account. &quot;We didn't get to $2 billion by always striking out,&quot; he says confidently. </TEXT></DOC>
