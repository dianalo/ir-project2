China's new rulers closed pawnshops, calling them symbols of oppression, and Mr. Xie then peddled cotton, candies and cigarettes for a living. During the Cultural Revolution in the 1960s he wrote self-criticisms for having abetted &quot;capitalistic exploitation.&quot;    Now, at age 77, Mr. Xie is back working in a pawnshop. &quot;I never dreamed that I would be doing this job again,&quot; says the bespectacled old man.    With the assistance of Mr. Xie, the Hua Mao Pawn Shop opened in late December. China's first pawnshop since 1949, it resumed a trade that dates back some 1,500 years in China. Yet like many of the private businesses Beijing has retrieved from post-1949 banishment, the pawnshop has Chinese-style &quot;socialist characteristics.&quot;    &quot;In the past, pawn shops exploited, ensnared and squeezed the poor with their high interest rates,&quot; says Zhao Keqiang, the shop's manager and one of the founders. &quot;We're making every effort to change that image.&quot;    The teller's counter, for instance, traditionally was taller than the average Chinese and had a barred window. Tellers literally would look down on customers, who held their hands above their heads to display belongings. Now, a waist-high desk stands in the middle of a small office furnished with sofas and coffee tables. There are no bars. Clerks and clients maneuver among a clutter of bicycles, electric fans and other pledged property. Gone too is the high wood fence that shielded the entrance of a pawnshop, designed to hide the client from prying eyes.    The shops usually were found on dark alleys, another small mercy for embarrassed customers. By contrast, Hua Mao is centrally located in downtown Chengdu, the capital of populous Sichuan province. A tall glass door allows passers-by a good view of the interior.    &quot;Ours is a high-class pawnshop,&quot; says Mr. Zhao. &quot;Going into our shop is nothing one should be ashamed of.&quot;    But to Lai Guanfu, the new-look pawnshop does little to ease the old-fashioned feeling. The 23-year-old factory worker needs to settle a gambling debt by borrowing 50 yuan ($13.50) on the security of an electric fan.    Mr. Zhao says the group of young entrepreneurs who started the pawnshop were encouraged to do so by an article about pawnshops in Moscow. If such business is tolerated in the Soviet Union where socialism is entrenched, they reasoned, why can't China do the same?    The founders' plan quickly gained approval from government departments. Too young to have seen a pawn shop, their next problem was finding someone with experience. The search led them to Mr. Xie.    Like a conventional pawnshop, Hua Mao lends money on collateral ranging from leather coats to antiques, provided their value exceeds 100 yuan ($27).    But Hua Mao also fills a gap in China's financial-services system, which largely ignores credit for individuals. The shop provides funds for purchasing consumer goods and loans for a small but fast-growing group of private businessmen whom state banks reject. Hua Mao's biggest loan was 12,000 yuan ($3,225) to help a businessman get his private venture started. The borrower left his new car as security. The smallest loan was 34 yuan for a traveler stranded in Chengdu who left his worn wristwatch.    Hua Mao charges a high annual interest of 48%, compared with state-owned banks' average of 6%. &quot;We're just making a reasonable profit. That, too, is our socialist characteristic,&quot; says Zhao Yijin, a shop clerk unrelated to the manager.    Private entrepreneurs, who can better afford the high rates, make up more than half of Hua Mao's clientele. One businessman pledged his motorcycle for a 2,000 yuan loan to buy a plane ticket to Canton. Two days later he returned and used the proceeds from his successful business trip to reclaim his bike.    Restoration of the pawnshop business reflects the growing affluence of the Chinese, Hua Mao officials say. In the past, people had few valuables that would command a resale value. But households these days boast television sets and other electronic products, thanks to an economy invigorated by more-open policies.    &quot;In the old society, pawn shops lent money to the poor to buy food,&quot; says Mr. Zhao, the manager. &quot;We lend to the rich to improve their quality of life.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
