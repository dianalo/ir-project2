Israeli newspapers said U.S. officials were angered by lack ofprogress and had told Israel they might support Egyptian demands forconcessions in Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's peace plan.   Israeli soldiers imposed a curfew on Talluza, a West Bank village35 miles north of Jerusalem, after residents stoned an army truckand set it afire, military and Arab sources reported.   The truck driver, said to have lost his way, escaped and fled toa nearby army base. Soldiers later entered the village, and Arabsources said they were searching for those who attacked the truck.   Arab hospital sources said 20 Palestinians in the occupiedterritories were wounded Monday by lead or plastic bullets shot bysoldiers.   Since the uprising began 21 months ago, 557 Palestinians havebeen killed by Israeli soldiers or civilians and 39 Israelis havedied. At least 106 Palestinians have been slain by fellow Arabs whoaccused them of collaborating with Israel.   In a leaflet distributed in the Israeli-occupied lands Monday,the uprising's underground leaders accused the United States of``regressing'' in talks with the leadership of the PalestineLiberation Organization.   It said ``the American obstinancy is blocking tangible progressin a peace settlement.''   The United States began talks with the PLO in December after thegroup recognized Israel and renounced terrorism. That stategy,spearheaded by PLO chief Yasser Arafat, seemed to rest on persuadingthe United States to pressure on Israel to make concessions forpeace.   But the leaflet said the lack of progress ``casts serious doubtsamong the rank-and-file of our people about the usefulness of theU.S.-PLO dialogue.''   It added: ``Facing these obstacles, our people have no choice butto escalate the uprising, the only option for reaching freedom andindependence.''   Israel radio said, meanwhile, that U.S. Ambassador William Browntold Israeli officials last week Secretary of State James A. BakerIII was ``favorably disposed'' to Egypt's stand on the Shamir planfor elections in the occupied territories.   The plan, put forward in April, calls for electing Palestiniansto open talks with Israel on interim autonomy for the territories.   President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt raised 10 points related to theplan that essentially demand such Israeli concessions as agreeing totrading occupied land for peace and allowing the 140,000 Arabs ofeast Jerusalem to vote.   Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc has ruled out either step. But theleft-of-center Labor Party, which is a partner with Likud in thecoalition government, has accepted both moves.   American diplomats were not available to comment on the reportsbecause of the Labor Day holiday.   In their leaflet, the uprising leaders called for residents ofthe occupied lands to ``refrain from rash decisions'' aboutsuspected collaborators and consult uprising leaders before warningor punishing them.   A similar appeal in a leaflet distributed Aug. 15 had no effect.   There have been reports Israeli security forces are armingcollaborators, and the Hebrew daily Maariv said Monday that theArabs were receiving military training in use of weapons.</TEXT></DOC>
