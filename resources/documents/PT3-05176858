and a fuzzy inference apparatus which is constructed      in a manner such that a membership function relating to the burr amount, a      membership function relating to the shrinkage cavity amount, and at least      one of a membership function of a value relating to a molding temperature      and a membership function of a value relating to a molding pressure, and      rules using the burr amount and the shrinkage cavity amount as input      variables and also using at least either one of the value relating to the      molding temperature and the value relating to the molding pressure as an      output variable are used, the burr amount and the shrinkage cavity amount      which have been inputted by the inputting means are applied to the rules      to thereby execute a fuzzy inference, and at least either one of the value      relating to the molding temperature and the value relating to the molding      pressure is generated and given to the molding machine. </PAR><PAR>  A method of controlling a molding machine according to the invention      comprises the steps of: receiving a burr amount and a shrinkage cavity      amount of a molded article which have been inputted; using a membership      function relating to the burr amount, a membership function relating to      the shrinkage cavity amount, a membership function of a value relating to      a molding temperature, a membership function of a value relating to a      molding pressure, and rules using the burr amount and the shrinkage cavity      amount as input variables and also using the value relating to the molding      temperature and the value relating to the molding pressure as output      variables;

The burr amount B and the      shrinkage cavity amount H which have been detected are given to a fuzzy      inference apparatus 4. Membership functions and fuzzy inference rules,      which will be explained hereinlater, have been preset in the fuzzy      inference apparatus 4. By applying the burr amount B and the shrinkage      cavity amount H which are supplied from the sensors 2 and 3 to the fuzzy      inference rules, the fuzzy inference apparatus 4 executes a fuzzy      inference and obtains molding temperature change amount data t and molding      pressure change amount data p and sends them to the molding machine 1. </PAR><PAR>  An initial molding temperature T and an initial molding pressure P have      previously been given to the molding machine 1. A molded article is formed      on the basis of the temperature T and the pressure P. After the molded      article was ejected out of the molding machine 1, the burr amount B and      the shrinkage cavity amount H of the molded article are detected by the      sensors 2 and 3. By inputting the detected burr amount B and shrinkage      cavity amount H, the fuzzy inference apparatus 4 infers correction      temperature data t for the present molding temperature T and correction      pressure data p for the present molding pressure P, respectively. Since      the correction data t and p are given to the molding machine 1, the      molding temperature and the molding pressure in the molding machine 1 are      adjusted by (Tandplus;t) and (Pandplus;p), respectively. The detections of the burr      amount B and the shrinkage cavity amount H, the fuzzy inference processes,      and the adjustments of the molding temperature T and the molding pressure      P are repeated as necessary. Thus, the molding of a molded article without      a burr and a shrinkage cavity is realized. </PAR><PAR>  The construction and operation of the fuzzy inference apparatus 4 will now      be described. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2a shows membership functions which are commonly used for the burr      amount B and the shrinkage cavity amount H as input variables of the fuzzy      inference apparatus 4. In the embodiment, four kinds of membership      functions ZR to PL are used. ZR denotes almost zero, PS denotes positive      small, PM denotes positive medium, and PL denotes positive large,      respectively. ZR to PL are called labels of the membership functions here. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2b shows membership functions which are commonly used for the molding      temperature change amount data t and the molding pressure change amount      data p as output variables. In the embodiment, membership functions of      seven kinds of labels of NL to PL are used. NL denotes negative large, NM      denotes negative medium, and NS denotes negative small, respectively. ZR,      PS, PM, and PL have the same meanings as those mentioned above. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 shows an example of fuzzy rules to infer the molding temperature      change amount data t and the molding pressure change amount data p. </PAR><PAR>  The first rule </PAR><PA1>  If Bandequals;PL, Handequals;ZR, then tandequals;NM, pandequals;NL </PA1><PAL>  substantially shows the following two rules. </PAL><PA1>  If Bandequals;PL, Handequals;ZR, then tandequals;NM and </PA1><PA1>  If Bandequals;PL, Handequals;ZR, then pandequals;NL. </PA1><PAR>  In a manner similar to the above, each of the other rules can be separated      into two rules relating to the molding temperature change amount t and the      molding pressure change amount p, respectively. </PAR><PAR>  B denotes the burr amount and H indicates the shrinkage cavity amount.      Bandequals;PL, Handequals;ZR, and the like are called antecedents and tandequals;NM, pandequals;NL, and the      like are called consequents. </PAR><PAR>  When the input value of the burr amount B and shrinkage cavity amount H are      given, the fuzzy inference apparatus 4 obtains adaptations (membership      function values) for the membership functions corresponding to the input      values in the respective fuzzy rules. The smallest one of the adaptation      values in the antecedents is calculated as an antecedent adaptation every      fuzzy rule (MIN operation). Each of the membership function relating to      the consequent of the corresponding fuzzy rule is truncated by the      antecedent adaptation obtained in each rule as mentioned above      (truncation, MIN operation), respectively. Further, all of the consequent      membership functions of the fuzzy rules determined are superposed with      respect to each of the molding temperature change amount and the molding      pressure change amount (MAX operation). Positions of center of gravity in      the superposed membership functions are determined as the molding      temperature change amount data and the molding pressure change amount      data. </PAR><PAR>  In the above embodiment, the molding temperature change amount data and the      molding pressure change amount data have been obtained by the fuzzy      inferences. Alternatively, the optimum molding temperature and the optimum      molding pressure may be also directly inferred. To adjust the molding      temperature and the molding pressure, coefficients to be multiplied to      them may be also fuzzy inferred. </PAR><PAR>  Further, a molding time, a molding speed, and the like are also inferred in      addition to the molding temperature and the molding pressure and the      molding machine can be also controlled by those data. </PAR><PAR>  Although the above embodiment has been constructed so as to respectively      detect the burr amount by using the first sensor and to detect the      shrinkage cavity amount by using the second sensor, it is also possible to      judge a burr amount and a shrinkage cavity amount by the operator by using      the eyes and the results of the judgments are supplied to the fuzzy      inference apparatus 4 by using the inputting apparatus. In such a case,      the burr amount and the shrinkage cavity amount may be also supplied by      using numerical values or by using the labels of the foregoing membership      functions. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
