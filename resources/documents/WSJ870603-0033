The men face prison terms of as long as 30 years for promoting the oil and gas ventures in which investors from all over the country allegedly were bilked of about $9.4 million. The sentencing hearing hasn't been scheduled.    According to the district attorney's office, Michael Strand of Salt Lake City was convicted following the four-week trial of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and three counts of aiding and abetting in mail fraud. A. Leonard Verah, of New York City, was convicted of two counts of securities fraud, three counts of mail fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud. And Gayland Ross, of Salt Lake City, was convicted of one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and three counts of mail fraud.    The office said the men misrepresented the production of an oil field they had drilled, failed to tell investors of the ownership of Messrs. Strand and Verah in the ventures and failed to tell investors that Mr. Strand also was convicted in 1978 for securities fraud.    The case was brought to trial by the district attorney's office and the Atlanta office of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which became involved because a number of Tennessee investors had losses related to the scheme. </TEXT></DOC>
