Motorola's selection raises hopes for that company andothers seeking to win bigger pieces of Japan'smultibillion-dollar telecommunications market.</LP><TEXT>   Analysts' reports on Motorola's apparent triumph sent thecompany's common stock soaring to a 52-week high. It rose$3.75, closing at $83.75.   In Tokyo, an official at Japan's Ministry of Posts andTelecommunications who is involved with the selection saidthe decision wasn't final, but that Motorola's equipment hadproved superior in competitive tests.   The selection of Motorola technology by Nippon Telegraph andamp;Telephone Corp. means certain of the equipment in all thecellular phones Nippon Telegraph sells would use systems withspecifications patented by Motorola -- no matter who thesupplier is. Thus the selection would open a huge new marketfor Motorola as a supplier and a licenser of cellular systemsmade by other manufacturers. A spokesman at Motorola, ofSchaumburg, Ill., couldn't immediately estimate the expectedsize of the Japanese market or the anticipated added salesfor his company. But he said, &quot;It will enhance our ability tosell equipment in Japan.&quot;   The Japanese ministry official said the digital voicetechnology standard was one of three categories that werebeing examined to draft an overall standard for Japan'sdigital mobile phone system. He said testing hasn't yet beencompleted for the other two standards, and didn't know ifMotorola was competing for that business.   The Japanese official, who asked not to be identified,said the ministry will reach a final decision on digitalstandards by the end of the year.   NTT's announcement last week that it selected Motorola,along with American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. and AB L.M.Ericsson of Sweden, to develop certain equipment was part ofthe same study.   Motorola last year complained that it was being excludedfrom parts of Japan's analog mobile-phone market -- thetechnology that is used for the current standard. Japan,under threat of heavy sanctions from the U.S., opened up thatmarket to Motorola.   According to some studies, Japan's mobile-phone market haspenetration only about one-fourth that of the U.S. Butanalysts have said that opening up the market to morecompetitors, in addition to moving to the more advanceddigital technology, may help cut prices and spread use.   The Motorola technology specifically selected is itsspeech coder, which translates the voice for electronictransmission. Nippon Telegraph has said it expects tocomplete development of a new generation of cellular phonesystems by 1992.   Traditionally, Nippon Telegraph has rarely publiclydisclosed development projects, instead quietly farming themout to Japanese companies. But, under U.S. pressure, NTT inrecent years has been trying to demonstrate publicly it isopening up its procurement process to foreign firms.   NTT ordered $350 million of U.S. equipment in the Japanesefiscal year that ended in March, but this amount wasequivalent to only 4% of the company's total procurement of$8.75 billion.   Separately, Motorola said it received a $35 million orderfor cellular phone infrastructure equipment from Japan MobileCommunications. Motorola said the order will be for equipment&quot;over the next year&quot; in the Tokyo area. A spokesman said thecontract calls for unspecified additional orders. Someanalysts estimated the value of the contract could reachseveral hundred million dollars during the next severalyears, and represent yet another breakthrough for Motorola inthe burgeoning Japanese market.   ---   Jacob M.
