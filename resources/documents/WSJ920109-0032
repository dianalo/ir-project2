Television commercials began airing yesterday followingMotor Trend's announcement, and the print ads are to beginrunning today. &quot;There's never been a car so acclaimed,&quot; theads say. &quot;It could change the way you think about Americanautomobiles.&quot; The ads were created by Cadillac's agency,D'Arcy, Masius, Benton andamp; Bowles, at its Bloomfield Hills,Mich., office.</LP><TEXT>   The Seville was redesigned for 1992, and the STS versionhas a base price of $37,975. The new Seville is strikinglydifferent from the traditional chrome-laden, cushy-rideCadillacs that appealed to older customers. Its curved,European-style dashboard, smaller size and relativelychromeless exterior have won younger buyers.   This is the second time in the award's 40 years that aCadillac has won the magazine's top honors for a domesticcar.   &quot;At Cadillac, we've paid our dues for cars that weren'tworthy to win,&quot; said John O. Grettenberger, Cadillac'sgeneral manager. &quot;Seville is living proof that Detroit andthe American auto industry can design distinctive,fun-to-drive cars.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
