Frank DeGeorge, the department's inspector general, hasbegun an investigation of how agency's office of anti-boycottcompliance handled the Baxter matter, senior departmentofficials said.</LP><TEXT>   Sen. Charles Grassley (R., Iowa) and some of hiscongressional aides have alleged that William Skidmore, topofficial in the anti-boycott office, tried to thwartinvestigators in his own office as they looked into whetherBaxter, the hospital-supply company based here, violated U.S.law.   Mr. Skidmore declined to comment. Department officialscautioned the investigation is based solely on Mr. Grassley'sallegations and not on any facts independently in theirpossession.   Investigators from the anti-boycott office are lookinginto whether Baxter, through its 1988 sale of a plant inIsrael, violated the 1977 law prohibiting U.S. concerns fromcooperating with the Arab boycott. That inquiry has growninto a criminal one, with Commerce investigators now workingwith federal prosecutors in Chicago.   The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is alsoinvestigating whether Baxter cooperated with boycottauthorities in Damascus, Syria, or paid any overseas bribesto get off the Arab blacklist.   Baxter denies that it paid any bribes. The company hasconsistently maintained it sold its intravenous fluidsbusiness in Ashdod, Israel, only because that facility wasn'tcommercially successful. The company says its agreement tobuild an intravenous fluids plant in Syria was the main eventleading Arab officials to remove Baxter from its list ofboycotted companies.</TEXT></DOC>
