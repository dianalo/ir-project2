Bell Atlantic isin New Zealand but not in Bermuda. U.S. West is in Hong Kongbut not in Canada. And California's Bell, the Pacific TelesisGroup, is focused on Europe instead of Mexico.   The awkwardly commodious executive floor at PacificTelesis's headquarters tower here has the look of a companywith weight to throw around. The former Pacific Telephone wasin a position to do so, hostile rate commissionersnotwithstanding. Until recently, big banks were similarlytaken with grandiosity.</LP><TEXT>   Behind the dark-wood paneling in one corner, however, youmeet a product of the old era who since 1987 has guided thisregional Bell's thrust into competition -- into thin air forthe most part. For PacTel Corp., the less-regulated Telesissubsidiary that Lee Cox heads, is more than anything else awireless-communications company.   &quot;Most people think of things in decades,&quot; says Mr. Cox.&quot;Here we think of things in centuries. So, if you can say the20th century was the wired century, where we went all the wayfrom Alexander Graham Bell to where we are with mobile data,the next century will be the wireless century.   &quot;The very unique thing happening in the world right now,never to happen again probably, is that in Western Europe,now Eastern Europe, now certain parts of Asia, maybe in theyear 2020 parts of Africa, Latin America and so on, thesewireless franchise licenses are becoming available. Once youhave the license, then you {can} provide any kind oftechnology on that piece of the spectrum.&quot;   The Bells battle each other and equally potent foreignrivals to get those licenses at profitable rates of return.Cellular-telephone and paging services are big. As yet,overseas rights account for only about 1% of the Bells'assets but PacTel is the leader. It has made a few Asianinroads, mainly in Thailand, but its big reach has beenacross the Atlantic.   In Germany it may have hit the mother lode. It has a 26%stake in the consortium building a second cellular systemthere. Charles Schelke of Smith Barney values it at fivetimes all of PacTel's other foreign ventures combined. Mr.Cox calls it &quot;the best opportunity anywhere in the world inthe 1990s.&quot;   Not that it's without challenges. &quot;Parts of Germany willbe hard to do because of the Black Forest and othertopographics to engineer,&quot; Mr. Cox notes. &quot;We'll get it donebut it will just be more difficult than some place that'sflat. We put the system in Kuwait that's there now -- I thinkit's still there, anyway. That was just the opposite. Notrees to speak of, no deciduous trees particularly, whichcreate differences in how you tune the system in differentparts of the year. Flat, sand, no bodies of water to reflectthe radio signal.&quot; He should have been a travel agent for theU.S. Army.   The push for franchises abroad coincides with a sweepingprivatization movement. Mr. Cox ranks Germany, with theBundespost now split into three parts and its telecom unitsold, just behind the U.K. on the liberalization list. &quot;Italyis probably next,&quot; and PacTel is looking into it, Mr. Coxsays. Honorable mentions go to Spain, Portugal and Greece.   Despite the current economic crisis in eastern Germany, hesays he has &quot;great faith&quot; in its future. Elsewhere in theformer communist bloc, Czechoslovakia is his favorite. Anyprospects in the Soviet Union itself this decade? &quot;Sellingpizza in Red Square, maybe?&quot; he responds. &quot;I'd have to besure the current reforms will take hold and grow. Talk abouthaving a fragile economy]&quot;   The socialist world is not inviting to this born-againentrepreneur: &quot;What are the terms they are offering? They'llall want a telephone infrastructure, because they know that'sa key to a vibrant economy. And they want you to pay for it.In most cases, they're not willing to give you an equityinterest that matches the equity participation. . . . Andthen where do you get your revenue stream? There's not enoughdisposable income to give you the kind of rate structure youneed to be successful, so you'd have to underprice yourproduct and not be profitable for a long period of time tillthe economy got good enough to create prices that peoplecould afford. It's a horrible, vicious circle.&quot;   PacTel also disdains some openings in the West that haveattracted its Bell brothers. It &quot;elected not to participate&quot;in the selloff of the phone company in New Zealand. InAustralia, Mr. Cox says, the government plans to combine thelocal and long-distance services of the state system, afterwhich &quot;they've offered to create a competitor that would haveas its base a company called Aussat, a long-distance carriersaddled with $700 million of debt and very little ongoingrevenue. It's not just David against Goliath, it's Pee WeeHerman vs. Goliath.&quot;   One of the boldest privatization drives may be happeningin Mr. Cox's back yard, in Mexico, but PacTel hasn't bitten.Shakiness of the current reformist government and itscurrency is fretted over.   In addition to wireless, PacTel Corp. is high on cabletelevision, which Mr. Cox believes will not soon give groundto fiber optics in developed cities.   In the U.K., where it's part of a wireless consortium andis also permitted to compete in local phone service, PacTelhas 14 cable franchises serving 1.6 million homes. There,however, it must overcome satellite alternatives as well as amodest British appetite for, and supply of, program variety.Across the Irish Sea, the problem is primarily political.PacTel tried last year to get a cable franchise but Dublinpicked the state phone monopoly.   Entering the cable market in the U.S. has been no easier.The regional Bells are blocked from offering programming intheir local service areas, and efforts in Congress to liftthat ban failed this year. But Mr. Cox is aiming for less: Heseeks to bid for cable in other jurisdictions, where he saysno one can justly argue that PacTel has an unfair advantage.Specifically, he wants to exercise an option in Chicago. Heneeds a waiver from Harold Greene, the federal judge whostill lords over the phone companies after the ATandamp;T breakupin 1984. An appellate court has ordered Judge Greene toreview, using a different economic model, his denial ofapplications such as PacTel's in Chicago, and Mr. Cox sayshe's confident of approval soon.   At 49, he has been handed the growth portfolio at PacificTelesis. That carries more risk than if he had been elevatedto head Pacific Bell, the company's big utility unit. Mr. Coxcites seven PacTel units that have been divested in its shortlife.   When he's not echoing consumer confusion over service inthe wake of deregulation, Mr. Cox acknowledges the newenvironment is &quot;invigorating.&quot; You could argue that with theBells now scrambling to best each other for business abroad,the breakup will prove in the end a boon to the export ofU.S. know-how. If competition is likewise fostered at home,Americans, too, may be on the receiving end.</TEXT></DOC>
