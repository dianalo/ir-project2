KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   If the Reagan administration wins finalapproval of its plan to allow China to launch U.S.-madecommunications satellites, national security will be damaged andthe U.S. commercial space industry will be ``cut off at theknees,'' a Democratic congressman says.   Rep. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., whose district includes the U.S. spacelaunch center at Cape Canaveral, told reporters that chances tooverturn the decision in the few remaining days of the 100thCongress are ``very slim.''   ``We'll give it the old college try, but it will be verydifficult to beat them back,'' Nelson said.   Friday's announcement represented a victory for the StateDepartment, which overrode contentions by the TransportationDepartment and private industry that the deal will place U.S.producers of satellite launchers at a competitive disadvantage.   The plan was denounced by Martin Marietta Corp., which makesrockets for commercial use.   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said the transactionis the first of its kind involving a ``non-Western'' destination.Another official, speaking only on condition of anonymity, saidPresident Reagan made the final decision because of theinter-agency conflict.   The transaction is subject to approval by Congress and by agroup of Western allies that monitor high-technology transfers.   Nelson said he believes national security will be damaged if thedeal goes through because ``when we allow them to integrate one ofthe most sophisticated satellites known to planet Earth onto aChinese rocket we have just given away a great part of the Americanadvantage.''   He said the sale will enable the Chinese to learn technology inwhich the United States has the world's leading edge.   ``We're giving away American jobs and the technology needed tokeep those jobs,'' the congressman asserted. ``The nation is illserved by this decision because it cuts the fledgling Americanrocket industry off at the knees.''   Redman said a license application was submitted by HughesAircraft Co. for the Chinese launch of two of its satellites whichhave been ordered by an Australian consortium, AUSSAT.   He also announced the conditional approval of a license for thelaunch of a third U.S.-made satellite on a Chinese launch vehicle.Known as AsiaSat, the satellite will be launched on behalf of aHong Kong-based consortium with Chinese and British ownership.   Redman said that in reaching its decision, the administrationwas trying to assure the ability of the U.S. commercial launchindustry ``to compete on an equal footing with launches from anon-market economy, while continuing to promote increasedU.S.-China trade.''</TEXT></DOC>
