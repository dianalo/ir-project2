Instead, Vaughn and Sharane Fischer's other qualifications asadoptive parents should have been considered in a full hearing bythe lower-court judge who denied the couple's petition to adopt thechildren, whose mother had married Fischer, said attorney DavidNuffer.   The court heard oral arguments today from Nuffer, representingthe Fischers, and attorney Timothy Anderson on behalf of thechildren's grandfather and two aunts. The relatives opposed theadoption following the death from cancer of the mother, BrendaThornton. In 1987 she had married Fischer, who had two other wivesand more than a dozen children, three months before her death andassigned custody to the Fischer family.   ``The question of what is best for the children is central to theissue'' of whether the children should be permitted to remain in theFischer home in the polygamist southern Utah town of Hildale, saidNuffer.   But Anderson told the five justices that, like slavery, polygamywas ``an anathema to society'' that was ended with good reason inthe 19th century.   The Mormon Church dropped polygamy as a tenet of its faith in1890 in exchange for statehood. However, an estimated 20,000 to30,000 still practice plural marriage, although they areexcommunicated from the church if they do so.   Practicing polygamy is a second-degree felony in Utah, althoughthe law has not been actively enforced in more than three decades.   The case does not hinge on the Fischers' right to hold to theirfundamentalist Mormon beliefs, but on the state's responsibility toprotect children from being taught practices that are clearlyillegal, Anderson said.   The court will rule later on the matter. The Fischers want thejustices to remand the case back to 5th Circuit Court for a fullhearing on the issues.   Before her death, Ms. Thornton and Fischer signed a legaldocument relinquishing custody of her children to the Fischerfamily. In it, Ms. Thornton said she felt Vaughn and Sharane Fischerwould be good parents. The children's biological father, PhilThornton, consented to the release of the children to the Fischers.   But late last year, a judge dismissed an adoption petition filedby the Fischers, though he stayed the decision giving them a chanceto appeal. In dismissing the petition, Judge Dean E. Conder said thecase centered on one issue: whether the Fischers' polygamistlifestyle should disqualify them from adopting the children, thenranging in age from 5 to 19.   While the case was on appeal, the children continued to live withthe Fischers in their 14-bedroom house.   Ms. Thornton's stepsister, Pat Johanson, said the originalcustody transfer was signed under pressure from the fundamentalistsand Ms. Thornton really wanted her to take the children.   Five weeks before Ms. Thornton died, Ms. Johanson moved from herWashington, D.C., home to Hildale to be at her stepsister's bedside.She says that the dying woman confided that she wanted the childrenout of fundamentalism, but at the same time didn't want to doanything openly, fearing excommunication.   Ms. Johanson also said that the three youngest Thornton children,Julia, Janelle, and Deanne, came forward one at a time to say theydid not want to live with the Fischers.   But Steven Snow, attorney for the Fischers, has disputed thedeathbed conversations and statements concerning the children.   A friend of the court brief filed by the American Civil LibertiesUnion of Utah Foundation on behalf of the Fischers argues thatpolygamy should be permitted in the state.   Polygamy was sanctioned by the early Mormon Church, but after itwas banned by the state, the church condemned and distanced itselffrom the practice. However, some fundamentalist offshoots of theChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints still believe in thepractice.</TEXT></DOC>
