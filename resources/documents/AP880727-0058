IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, said Rafsanjani, who also iscommander-in-chief of Iran's armed forces, spoke in a battlefrontinterview Tuesday.   Nine Americans are believed held in Beirut by pro-Iranian ShiiteMoslem extremists.   ``So long as America keeps its hostile attitude toward Iran,there will be no sign of any changes and there will be nonegotiations,'' Rafsanjani said Tuesday in a television interviewmonitored in Nicosia.   He said that one indication of good will would be releasingIranian assets in the United States.   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater toldreporters: ``No deals. The clearest signal they could send is torelease the hostages.   ``We have heard this kind of thing before, but as far as we areconcerned you just can't link the two,'' Fitzwater said.   Rafsanjani, considered the second most powerful figure in theIranian government after the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, did notrefer to any specific Iranian assets in the United States.   But he said the Iranian government paid the United States forgoods not delivered before the Islamic revolution toppled thegovernment of the late Shah Reza Pahlavi in 1979.   State Department officials, speaking on condition of anonymity,said Rafsanjani probably was referring to military equipment, butthey had no dollar figure.   The United States broke relations with Tehran and put a hold onits U.S. assets after Iranians stormed the U.S. Embassy and took 52Americans hostage. They were released in January 1981 after 444days in captivity.   As part of the release agreement, the U.S.-Iran Claims Tribunalwas set up in the Hague, Netherlands, and charged with arbitratingbillions of dollars of U.S. and Iranian financial claims arisingfrom the Iranian revolution.   By 1987, the tribunal had awarded about $1 billion to Americanclaimants and about $60 million to Iranians, plus an undeterminedamount of interest to claimants on both sides.   In May, three French hostages held in Lebanon by pro-IranianShiite Moslems were released after the French government reportedlyagreed to repay a $1 billion loan to Iran.   Nine Americans are among the 18 foreigners missing and believedheld hostage in Lebanon by Shiite Moslem extremists. The longestheld is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for TheAssociated Press.   Anderson, 40, was abducted in Moslem west Beirut on March 16,1985.   On Tuesday, Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati of Iran said:``The problem of hostages in Lebanon is a question relating to theLebanese. It is not our question (problem).   ``But on the basis of humanitarian aspects, we will do our best,as we have done until now. And we do hope that all innocent peopleas hostages in Lebanon or any place in the world could be releasedvery soon.''   Velayati was in New York to discuss with U.N. officials acease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war. He met twice Tuesday withSecretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.   In an interview on the state-owned French television networkAntenne-2 on Tuesday, Perez de Cuellar said recent efforts towardpeace ``create a favorable atmosphere'' for the hostages held inLebanon.   He said he planned ``to ask Iran to offer its good offices toprompt the freeing of the hostages. It is not the first time I havemade an appeal for them to help.''   But he said, ``No one can affirm that it is Iran who isresponsible'' for the fate of the 18 men still held in Lebanon.   Anderson's sister, Peggy Say, contacted at her home in Cadiz,Ky., said: ``I think everything that's coming out of the MiddleEast and U.S. is encouraging.''   ``There seems to be a reaching out for communication. If Terry'scaptivity and the captivity of the other Americans is to meananything it would hopefully be a movement toward peace in theMiddle East.''</TEXT></DOC>
