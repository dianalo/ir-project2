The decisive defeat came on a 324-89 vote and sends thelegislation back to the House Banking Committee, which isexpected quickly to rewrite a bill that recapitalizes thedepleted bank insurance fund, tightens bank regulation, andends the current practice of reimbursing uninsured deposits-- those that exceed $100,000 and foreign deposits --starting in 1995. The panel will drop unpopular measures toallow banks to enter the securities business and othercontroversial measures that helped torpedo the bill.</LP><TEXT>   The administration and big banks had turned against thebill as Democratic leaders took control of the legislation,so the defeat of the bill provided them with a short-termvictory. But in the long run, the House vote could delay forat least two years -- until after next year's elections -- abanking law-modernization package that was one of theadministration's major domestic initiatives. The House'soverwhelming rejection of the package is likely to make theSenate, which is expected to start discussing the bill thisweek, wary of embracing a broad bill.   After the vote, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Bradyexpressed hope that both the House and the Senate still wouldbe able to agree to &quot;true, comprehensive reform&quot; before atarget Thanksgiving adjournment. But both Democrats andRepublicans agreed that this would be difficult.   &quot;A macro bill doesn't seem in the cards now,&quot; said Rep.Robert Walker of Pennsylvania, a deputy Republican whip.&quot;This vote shows how difficult this issue is&quot; for lawmakerswho have been so burned by the savings-and-loan crisis thatthey're afraid to vote for a broad banking bill that lookslike a bank bailout, he said. In addition, competingfinancial interest groups have lobbied lawmakers so fiercelythat &quot;it's hard for members to figure out what's in theinterest of their local communities.&quot;   In the latest of a series of twists on the complexlegislation, the administration and the American BankersAssociation -- the two groups that fought hardest for bankingreform in the first place -- battled successfully to defeatthe bill. They said that a provision added to the bill byRep. John Dingell (D., Mich.) and Rep. Henry Gonzalez (D.,Texas) gutted efforts to modernize the banking system byrolling back current bank powers to sell insurance andfoiling proposals to expand bank participation in thesecurities industry.   As a result of the Dingell-Gonzalez compromise, theDemocratic leadership worked hard for the bill initiallylaunched by the administration. In addition, the insuranceand securities industries worked unsuccessfully to keep thelegislation alive. Over the past decade, regulators and thecourts have gradually allowed banks to sell insurance andsecurities. Mr. Dingell, backed by insurers and investmentbankers, saw the bill as a way to limit and regulate thistrend.   Without the Dingell-Gonzalez provision, which was workedout over the past two weeks, banks expect to continue topress the courts for wider insurance and securities powers.This is one reason why insurers, investment bankers and Mr.Dingell may be willing to entertain compromise proposals thatthey have rejected to date.   When the bill goes back to the banking committee, theadministration and the committee will strive to retain onemajor breakthrough in the failed bill -- a measure to allowbanks to set up nationwide branch systems. According to oneconsulting firm, this change could eventually cut theindustry's annual expenses by $10 billion by allowingBankAmerica Corp., Citicorp, NCNB Corp., and others toconsolidate their separate multistate operations into asingle branch network.   Before voting down the entire bill, the House approved,366-4, an amendment to allow banks to branch nationwidewithin three years, unless a state specifically votes to denybranching authority within its borders. Administrationofficials have threatened to veto the bill if it doesn'tinclude adequate nationwide branching authority.   But Mr. Gonzalez, chairman of the Banking Committee, andMr. Dingell, chairman of the House Energy and CommerceCommittee, expressed doubts that the House would have time toinclude branching in a recast bill.   Even a narrow bill, however, would be significantlegislation, although bankers will complain that it boostsregulatory costs without giving new opportunities for savingsand business expansion.   Mr. Gonzalez said a narrow bill is likely to include:   -- FDIC Funding. The primary force behind the bill is theneed to augment the shrinking bank deposit insurance fundwith about $70 billion in new borrowing authority. The billwould increase to $30 billion from $5 billion the amount theFederal Deposit Insurance Corp. can borrow from the Treasuryto cover the costs of bank failures. The loans, plusinterest, would be repaid by premiums banks pay on domesticdeposits on a schedule worked out by the FDIC and theTreasury in consultation with Congress.   In addition, the bill would allow the FDIC to borrow up toabout $45 billion for working-capital needs. The money andinterest would be repaid as the FDIC sells the assets offailed banks.   -- Deposit Insurance. Although the House rejected aproposal to place new limits on the number of insuredaccounts a depositor can hold in one bank, the bill wouldreduce the scope of federal deposit insurance. The mostsignificant change would end the so-called too big to faildoctrine, under which the government protects all deposits,even those beyond the $100,000 insurance limit, in mostbanks. The FDIC's current ability to reimburse uninsureddeposits -- those over $100,000 and foreign deposits -- wouldbe sharply limited after 1994. The Federal Reserve Board'sability to keep banks alive with extended loans from itsdiscount window also would be restricted.   In addition, only the best-capitalized banks would be ableto offer insured brokered deposits -- large certificates ofdeposit sold through brokerage firms -- or to insure accountsestablished under employee pension plans.   -- Bank Regulation. The bill would establish a newframework for bank regulation by firmly linking supervisionto bank capital. As capital declines, regulators would haveto move quickly to halt dividends or change management.Regulators would have to close banks when capital falls below2% of assets, unless the banks were profitable and in theprocess of boosting their capital. The bill also wouldrequire regulators to perform annual onsite bankexaminations, and would tighten auditing requirements.   -- Foreign Banks. In response to the problems disclosed bythe Bank of Credit andamp; Commerce International, the legislationwould give the Federal Reserve new authority to policeforeign bank operations in the U.S.</TEXT></DOC>
