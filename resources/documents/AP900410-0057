The Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energysigned an agreement Monday to clean up the former uraniumprocessing plant. The agreement, subject to Justice Departmentreview, replaces a 1986 pact between the EPA and Energy Departmentthat was based on outdated information.   Valdas Adamkus, the EPA's regional administrator in Chicago,signed the agreement Monday. He said the EPA will use it to ensurethat the Energy Department properly handles the radioactivecontamination at the Feed Materials Production Center, 18 milesnorthwest of Cincinnati. The plant processed uranium for thegovernment's production of nuclear weapons.   ``U.S. EPA will make sure U.S. DOE cleans up the Fernaldfacility in an efficient, complete and timely manner to protecthuman health and the environment,'' Adamkus said.   ``Today's proposed agreement requires U.S. DOE to clean up themost contaminated areas on an accelerated schedule. It also allowsU.S. DOE the necessary time to investigate all environmentalthreats thoroughly and sets a realistically ambitious schedule foroverall cleanup.''   The agreement makes the EPA administrator the final arbiter ofdisputes. The EPA added the Fernald plant in November 1989 to theagency's national priority list of hazardous-waste sites.   Investigations for the cleanup will cost at least $80 million.The Energy Department projects the cleanup costs at $950 millionduring the next 12 years.   ``We don't have a lot of faith and a lot of trust,'' Ms.Crawford said. ``FRESH is still going to be here. We're going tohold them accountable.''   The agreement would require the Energy Department to finishremoving radioactively contaminated ground water from under plantbuildings; collect contaminated storm water runoff from groundwaste pits; contain contaminated water in the off-site Paddy's Runcreek; and stabilize tanks containing radioactive residues from thegovernment's World War II Manhattan Project, which helped developthe atomic bomb.   Radioactive and non-radioactive wastes are stored on the site,even though the plant's private contractor, Westinghouse MaterialsCo. of Ohio, stopped production in spring 1989 to concentrate oncleanup work.   Federal investigators have found a variety of safety andmanagement problems at the 16 major facilities in 12 statesinvolved in making nuclear weapons, and some have led to productionshutdowns and interruptions.   The problems include poor training of safety inspectors at theHanford Nuclear Reservation, near Richland, Wash., and the SavannahRiver Site, near Aiken, S.C., inadequate fire protection atSavannah River and alleged illegal dumping at the Rocky Flatsplant, located 16 miles northwest of Denver.</TEXT></DOC>
