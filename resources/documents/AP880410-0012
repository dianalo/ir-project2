Earlier, the hijackers threatened a ``slow and quiet massacre''of the hostages, but a noon deadline passed without incident.   Then, one minute before a second afternoon deadline expired,someone in the cockpit told the Larnaca Airport control tower,``They've already started to hurt on the passengers.'' The speakerwas believed to be the flight engineer.   Two hooded gunmen had ripped the inflatable escape chutes out ofthe plane and threw them onto the tarmac, then demanded thatworkers remove them from the runway to clear a path for the plane.   At 3 p.m., the flight engineer told the airport tower: ``Thehijackers are dictating this message. If they don't get a positiveresponse in one hour and 15 minutes regarding fuel and services,they will start hurting occupants of the aircraft.''   The engineer said an unspecified number of passengers were``sick,'' but when the control tower asked that they be released, avoice came on the radio and said, ``negative.''   Earlier, the hijackers said they would force the pilot to takeoff and crash into the Kuwaiti royal palace. There were believed tobe 53 people still on board the Kuwait Airways Boeing 747,including three members of Kuwait's royal family and about sixhijackers.   The latest threats came after a sixth round of talks between thegunmen and PLO officials from Cyprus. There was no word on what wassaid at the plane.   During the 6-day-old ordeal, at least one hostage has beenkilled _ a 24-year-old Kuwaiti man whose body was tossed onto thetarmac Saturday. He was shot after authorities refused hijackers'demands for more fuel.   Cyprus government spokesman Akis Fantis said Sunday that markson the slain passenger's body indicated he was severely beatenduring the 18 to 24 hours before his death.   In a morning statement, one of the hijackers told the controltower, ```We hereby re-announce our refueling request due to ourintention to (go to) Kuwait, the concerned country. And if Kuwaitrefuses us, a crash landing will take place on the ... prince'spalace.''   He asked the Cypriot government to accede to his requests,``preventing the slow and quiet massacre taking place in thiscountry. We perform (carry out) our sayings very accurately, and wehave been forced to send a sample yesterday.''   State-run Cyprus radio said the government and the PalestineLiberation Organization appealed to the gunmen not to carry outtheir threat.   One of the hijackers said they would release the hostages``immediately'' if the 17 pro-Iranian extremists, convicted inKuwait in the 1983 bombings of the U.S. and French embassies there,were freed. Kuwait has refused the demand.   Flight 422 landed in Larnaca on Friday. It was commandeeredTuesday en route to Kuwait from Bangkok with 112 people aboard andforced to land in Mashhad in northeastern Iran, where 57 peoplewere released. The jet left Iran and landed in Larnaca after beingrefused permission to land in Lebanon and Syria. Another captivewas freed in Larnaca.   Larnaca airport officials said the airport at San`a in NorthYemen was closed to traffic after unconfirmed reports that thegunmen wanted to fly there.   The director of San`a international airport, Mohammed al-Faqeeh,acknowledged that the facility was closed but said it was becauseof bad weather.   In reply to queries by The Associated Press, al-Faqeeh alsosaid, ``Anyway our airport is not equipped to receive such a hugeaircraft, and it would crash if it tried to land here.''</TEXT></DOC>
