The contentious, defiant strategy invoked by Texas Air chairmanFrank Lorenzo was on display this past week as the company stagedits long-delayed shareholders meeting in a Houston hotel with unionpickets chanting anti-Lorenzo slogans outside.   Meanwhile, in Chicago, a labor-management coalition pressed itsbid to buy UAL with the company's blessing, proving there is nostandard operating procedure for running an airline.   Lorenzo has carried an anti-union stigma for the past severalyears, starting with a confrontation at Texas Air subsidiaryContinental Airlines, which he took into bankruptcy court to nullifyunion contracts and lower costs.   Now out of bankruptcy court, Continental flies with mostlynon-union help and often leads the way in lowering ticket pricesbecause the airline is cheaper to operate than many of itscompetitors.   Although Lorenzo denies he opposes organized labor, his image asa union-basher grew over much of the past year, largely because of astrike at Texas Air's other airline, Eastern, which he also hashauled into bankruptcy court.   In the Eastern case, Lorenzo has hired non-unionists andpicket-line crossers to replace the strikers. He has plans to makethe airline a low-cost, smaller, more efficient operation regardlessof what happens in the strike.   Lorenzo reiterated those plans at the Texas Air annual meeting,where questions abounded about his own future as well as those ofEastern and Continental, which have enormous debts.   He denied speculation he might sell what's left of Eastern andwalk away from a business in which he has played a major role formore than a decade. On the contrary, Lorenzo predicted Eastern wouldstart making money next year.   A different drama was unfolding at UAL, one of the nation's mostprofitable airlines. Unlike Texas Air, UAL has long been seen as anattractive takeover target because it has low debt, lots ofairplanes that can be used as collateral, and a highly prized routenetwork into fast-growing Asia that could defray the impact of adomestic economic slowdown on the airline business.   Perhaps more important, a change of UAL management in 1988 hasgained the confidence of pilots, who struck four years ago in abitter dispute over pay.   That confidence has translated into their joint $6.75 billion bidwith management to buy UAL, an offer that makes important laborconcessions including pay cuts and a no-strike clause.   As of late last week their bid seemed to have a good chance ofsucceeding, although California investor Marvin Davis offered tomatch the bid without demanding concessions from the unions.   If the labor bid succeeds, UAL would become the largestemployee-owned company in the country, and could displace Texas Airas the low-cost trendsetter.   In other business and economic news this past week:   _Junk-bond repayment problems by Canadian property companyCampeau Corp. jolted the market and incited widespread anxiety aboutthe financial health of other companies that have sold the high-riskdebt securities. Some junk bonds tumbled in value and their yieldsrose to 30 percent.   _The government dumped a load of economic statistics on thefinancial markets that suggested the economy is slowing andinflation remains subdued, but the information did little toencourage the purchase of stocks and bonds. The Labor Departmentsaid wholesale prices dropped in August for the third straightmonth, and the Commerce Department said the July trade deficit hit afive-year low of $7.58 billion. It also said retail sales rose inAugust, but that was mainly due to a surge in auto buying that's notexpected to last.   _Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the Wall Street investment bankthat pioneered the use of junk bonds for takeovers and corporategrowth, formally pleaded guilty to six felonies and fines, penaltiesand other costs exceeding $650 million. The plea closed a chapter inan insider trading scandal that began with the arrest of speculatorIvan Boesky nearly three years ago.</TEXT><NOTE>End adv weekend editions Sept. 17-18</NOTE></DOC>
