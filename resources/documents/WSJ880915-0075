But the lower rates aren't likely to last long, many economists, builders and realestate salespeople say.    The indicated market rates required on 30-year fixed loans purchased by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., including servicing fees, fell to 10.53% yesterday from 11.02% on Aug. 15, the high for the year. Over the past month, reductions in fixed-rate loans of three-eighths of a percentage point have been fairly common.    Yesterday's mortgage-rate drop reflects increasing signs of economic softening, as well as yesterday's report that the trade deficit fell sharply in July to its lowest level since December 1984. Some housing industry officials say the lower rate is primarily a &quot;knee-jerk&quot; reaction to the deficit news and isn't expected to last more than six weeks. &quot;I'm a little surprised that there is this dip, but the fundamentals suggest that it's a delay of the trend where rates will continue to move up modestly,&quot; says James M. Wooten, chairman of Lomas Mortgage USA, Dallas.    The rate decline is expected to help maintain this year's overall strong home sales, despite a 4.7% drop in new-home sales in July, the latest month for which figures are available. But because the lower rate may not last long, builders and real-estate agents don't look for an extra surge in sales. Michael S. Carliner, an economist with the National Association of Home Builders, believes that by year end and into the 1989 first quarter rates will climb into the 11% to 11.5% range.    For now at least, lenders say, consumers who move quickly enough can lock in mortgages at the lower rates, which may be the lowest they'll be for the rest of the year. The gap between fixed-rate loans and many adjustable-rate mortgages has nearly disappeared, because short-term rates to which ARMs are tied have been rising more rapidly than long-term rates. As a result, many lenders and real-estate salespeople are recommending fixed-rate loans over ARMs.    Many smaller mortgage banks are undercutting prevailing fixed rates offered by most other lenders, speculating that interest rates won't move higher, or hoping servicing and origination fees will offset any losses on selling below-market-rate loans. For instance, in the big San Francisco Bay area market, small mortgage bankers are offering fixed, 30-year rates as low as 10% to 10.25%, while the biggest bank and thrift lenders' rates average 10.5% to 11%.    In addition, many thrifts are offering low rates for the first six to 12 months on adjustable loans, in an effort to keep business and loan-origination fees. For instance, as of Monday, initial rates of 7 3/8% to 7.5% on ARMs were widespread in California. The current market rate for these loans, which are tied to the lenders' average cost of funds, is about 10.1%. For the most popular kind of adjustable loans outside California, those tied to the one-year Treasury index, the current rate is about 10.75%.    ---                    Different Directions   Although 30-year fixed-rate mortgage loans have fallen recently, rates on adjustable loans have risen.
