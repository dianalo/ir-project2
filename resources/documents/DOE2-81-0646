Stability of coal liquids was improved whenasphaltenes and polar asphaltenes were removed by distillation. In orderto establish the technology to prevent the deterioration of the catalystactivity, it is desirable for the successful development of a processto effectively decrease alkali metal or alkaline earth metal compounds.Fundamental studies revealed that catalysts proposed for NEDOL pilotplant CGS (from molten iron gasifier) contain metallic iron and wuestitedust-sulfur and synthetic pyrite are superior to conventional red-mudsulfur catalyst.
