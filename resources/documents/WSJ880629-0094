The contract could be valued at as much as one billion Canadian dollars (US$828.1 million).    Mr. Beaudoin said following Bombardier's annual meeting that its aerospace unit, Canadair Inc., has an agreement in principle with Aerospatiale S.A. of France, a member of the Airbus Industrie consortium, to provide six airframe parts for the planned medium and long range Airbus planes.    If Airbus succeeds in selling 600 of the aircraft, the contract could represent sales of at least C$100 million a year for a total of C$1 billion over the life of the contract.    The Airbus parts contract is one of several transactions involving Canada and France that appear to be stalled in part due to the dispute over fishing rights involving St. Pierre, a tiny French territory off Newfoundland.    For example, Canada is due to decide soon between a French and a British design for its C$8 billion plan to build nuclear-powered submarines and Air Canada has hinted strongly that it may select the Airbus A-320 aircraft to replace its fleet of Boeing 727 aircraft. Bombardier is not involved in either of those matters.    Bombardier's Mr. Beaudoin said that Canadair applied to the Canadian government for assistance of about C$50 million, or about half of the tooling and engineering costs related to the Airbus parts contract under established government programs. But he said that a decision on the grant is being held up by a political decision from Ottawa.    The fishing dispute &quot;is delaying all negotiations between Canada and France,&quot; he said. He said that Bombardier has invested several million dollars in preparing the contract and hopes for a favorable outcome soon.    Mr. Beaudoin also said that Canadair is awaiting a political decision from the French government on an anticipated order of CL-215 water bombers from Canadair. The water bombers are used to fight forest fires.    Although Mr. Beaudoin linked the delay in the water bomber contract to the recent French government elections, he noted &quot;I once told the French that the CL-215s were caught in fishing nets,&quot; a reference to the fishing-rights dispute.    Montreal-based Bombardier makes transportation equipment and aircraft.    Separately, Bombardier said it plans to begin construction next month on a C$30 million base for Canadair's military aircraft division at Mirabel airport, north of Montreal. The center, which will be used to service the Canadian armed forces' CF-18 fighter aircraft, is expected to be completed in late 1989. </TEXT></DOC>
