The dispute goes to the very core of disunity in the national Democratic Party over defense and international affairs.    Mr. Aspin himself overturned Rep. Mel Price of Illinois as chairman of the Armed Services Committee two years ago. The Democrats at the time were looking for a more youthful, dynamic leader to fend off the Reagan administration's winning defense initiatives. On that count, Mr. Aspin has done a pretty good job for his fellow Democrats. The Pentagon has seen its budget turn from real growth to real decline. The administration has failed to win approval for large increases in funding for the Strategic Defense Initiative, and limits continue on the testing of anti-satellite weapons and chemical-munitions production.    Mr. Aspin has served the Capitol Hill arms-control lobby even better. He has been among the leaders in the fight to force President Reagan to continue to abide by the unratified, expired SALT II treaty and to halt nearly all nuclear testing. Last year he even bent House rules by skipping over members of his own Armed Services Committee to pack a House-Senate conference on arms control with non-committee liberals.    Politics being a game where you win some and lose some, you would think this record would be enough to satisfy the House Democrats' large liberal faction. It is not.    Expressing reasons for Wednesday's no-confidence vote, they cited his vote to back the MX missile in 1985 and his switch to support $100 million in aid to the Nicaraguan contras last year. They claim that Mr. Aspin hasn't been tough enough in conference committee with the Senate to keep overall Pentagon spending down in line with the House's demands. And some said Mr. Aspin hasn't been nice to them or kept his promises on key votes.    Well, these liberal Democrats are certainly hard to please. But a lot of people already know that. The party Walter Mondale led out of that convention hall in San Francisco was dominated by liberal Democrats but divided by the presence of other Democrats whom the liberals had shoved to the sidelines. Les Aspin's Armed Services Committee has been a microcosm of that San Francisco debacle.    Traditional defense-minded Democrats such as Charles Bennett and Sam Stratton sit on the committee beside such highly motivated liberals as Pat Schroeder, Nicholas Mavroules and Ron Dellums. It's hardly surprising that Mr. Aspin -- or anyone in that job -- isn't able to hand out enough red meat to satisfy all the residents of his party's ideological zoo.    The fact remains that Armed Services must deal with serious matters affecting national security. Centrist Democrats have been saying that their party must give evidence that the public can have confidence in the party's ability to handle this important area. The Aspin episode suggests that the Democrats' national-security differences are deep. </TEXT></DOC>
