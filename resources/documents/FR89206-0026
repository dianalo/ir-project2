The proposal wouldmodify the current requirement that Federal mutual associations obtainthe prior approval of either the Board or a Supervisory Agent before releasingtheir customer records. Through this proposal, the Board seeks to balancethe legitimate business interests of Federal associations in disclosingcustomer records with customer expectations of confidentiality.In addition, by separate action, the Board is withdrawing certain proposedamendments to sections in 12 CFR 543 and 544 proposed in Corporate GovernanceParts II, III and IV. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments must be received on or before April 7, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Please send comment letters to the Director, InformationServices Section, Office of the Secretariat, Federal Home Loan Bank Board,1700 G Street NW., Washington, DC 20552.

Current Regulations and Office of General Counsel Interpretations</ITAG>Section 545.131(a) of the Board's regulation sets forth limitations onpublic disclosure by a Federal mutual association of its ``membership list.''As used in andSection; 545.131, a ``membership list'' includes a list ofthe names of the members of the association, their addresses, their savingsaccount or loan account records, or any data from which information reasonablycould be constructed. 12 CFR 545.131(a) (1988). Section 545.131(a)(2) generallyprohibits Federal mutual associations from disclosing membership listswithout the prior written approval of the Board. The regulation containsexceptions for disclosure to officers of the association and to those personsemployed by them in the usual course of the association's business. Section545.131(a) permits a Supervisory Agent to approve or disapprove an applicationby a Federal mutual association to release such lists and to specify anyterms or conditions for such release. <T3>Id. </T3>andSection; 545.131(a)(3). Section 545.131(b) gives a memberof a Federal mutual association the right to inspect only those recordsof the association pertaining to his or her own savings or loan accounts.\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Section 545.131(c) gives members of a Federal mutual associationthe right to communicate with other members of the association only inthe manner precribed in paragraph (d). Paragraph (d) of andSection; 545.131establishes procedures for communications between members of a Federalmutual association. Finally, andSection; 545.131(e) defines the term ``impropercommunications'' for purposes of paragraph (d) of that section. Section544.5(b)(6) contained in Part 544, concerning the charter and bylaws ofFederal mutual association, provides that communications between membersshall be consistent with andSection; 545.131. These sections are not proposedto be altered by the regulations proposed herein.In construing the provisions of andSection; 545.131, the Board's Office ofGeneral Counsel (``OGC'') has interpreted the regulation to permit disclosureto an ``agent'' of the association, pursuant to a written agency agreement,where the agent acts as the functional equivalent of an officer or employeeconducting the business of the association in its usual course. Disclosurealso has been permitted to an association's wholly owned service corporationsor its wholly owned subsidiaries, when such release has been approved bythe Supervisory Agent. Under the authority of Supervisory Agents to specifythe terms and conditions of such approval, approval has been conditionedprimarily upon the membership list being released to the service corporationor subsidiary pursuant to a written agreement that would protect the members'rights of privacy. <T3>See, e.g.</T3>, OGC Ops. by R. Stewart (Feb. 27, 1985); J. Williams(March 17, 1986) and J. Williams (March 21, 1986). While no Board regulationspecifically applies to the release of customer lists by a Federal stockassociation, other than 12 CFR 552.11(d) prohibiting release of depositorlists to stockholders, the OGC has by interpretive opinion applied to Federalstock associations the same limitations concerning release of customerlists as are applied to Federal mutual associations. <T3>Id.</T3><ITAG tagnum="84">B. Description of the Corporate Governance Proposals </ITAG>As part of Corporate Governance II, III, and IV, the Board proposed changesto its regulations governing release of customer records. <T3>See </T3>50 FR 52,482 (Dec. 24, 1985); 52 FR 25,870 (July 9, 1987).Taken together, the outstanding proposals currently provide: (1) That nostockholder or any other person would have the right to obtain or inspectlists of depositors in or borrowers from Federal stock associations orother confidential deposit or loan information, 50 FR 52,501; and (2) thatthe disclosure of membership lists of Federal mutual associations to anyperson except officers or other employees of an association in the ordinarycourse of business is generally prohibited. However, the disclosure ofcustomer records by a Federal mutual association to its wholly owned servicecorporations or subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business is permittedif the lists are required to be used by the subsidiaries solely in theordinary course of the business of either the subsidiary or the associationand if disclosure is made under conditions designed to protect the confidentialityof the records so disclosed. 52 FR 25,880. Specifically, the CorporateGovernance proposals would have conditioned any disclosure of membershiplists on: (1) The existence of a written agreement under which the subsidiaryreceiving the records agreed to use the records solely in the ordinarycourse of business and further agreed not to sell or otherwise make thelists publicly available; and (2) the prior written approval of a SupervisoryAgent of the terms of the confidentiality agreement. <T3>Id</T3>.This latest version of Corporate Governance contained proposed andSection;554.9-2, which provided that members of, or depositors in, Federal mutualassociations had the right to obtain and inspect the association's booksand record pertaining solely to the member's or depositor's own savingsor loan accounts and that Federal mutual associations may disclose membershiplists to their wholly owned subsidiaries and to the association's officersor employees in the ordinary course of conducting the association's business.<T3>Id</T3>.The comment period for Corporate Governance Proposal Part II ended on February24, 1986. The end of the comment period for the Corporate Governance ProposalParts III and IV, originally set at September 8, 1987, was extended untilFebruary 1, 1988. 52 FR 42,116 (Nov. 3, 1987). The Board has also consideredcomments filed after that date. The Board received fifty-three commentsconcerning proposed andSection;andSection; 543.9-3, 544.9-2, and 545.131. <ITAG tagnum="84">C. Discussion of Comments Submitted in Response to the Corporate GovernanceProposal Parts II, III and IV </ITAG>Nineteen commenters responded to proposed andSection; 543.9-3(d) of CorporateGovernance Part II, under which no stockholder or any other person wouldhave the right to obtain or inspect lists of names and/or addresses ofdepositors or borrowers of their loan or savings account information. Thesecommenters, asserting that the proposed section provided Federal mutualassociations with a procedure to follow for disclosing such lists whileFederal stock associations would be restricted from making such disclosures,argued that the distinction in treatment was without basis. With respect to the rule set forth in proposed andSection; 544.9-2(a)(2)that a Federal mutual association may release membership lists only toits officers or employees in the ordinary course of conducting the association'sbusiness, twenty-three commenters asserted that the provision was undulyrestrictive. They explained that many associations use ``contract vendors''or ``third party vendors'' to perform necessary services on behalf of theassociations such as check printing, data processing and mailing, and thatit was crucial to release at least minimal membership information to entitiesthat perform such tasks. These commenters requested that the proposal beamended to include release not only to officers and employees, but alsoto those employed in the ordinary course of the association's business.In this way, the commenters claim, the confidentiality of the depositorsrecords would still be preserved. About twenty-five other commenters advocated a much more expansive disclosureprovision. These commenters urged that access to the association's depositrecords be granted to, for example, property tax payment services, preparersof annual mortgage statements, direct mail promoters, sellers of tax-deferredannuities and mutual funds, and providers of life and property insurance.Most commonly mentioned were companies that offer mortgage life insuranceand group insurance, which, it was claimed by commenters, may protect theassociation by preventing loan foreclosures and benefit borrowers by providingsuch insurance at low group rates and offering the convenience of payingalong with a loan payment. Moreover, at least five commenters stressedthe importance of the fee income provided by these contract vendors andurged that its deprivation would ill-serve the goal of increasing the financialstrength of Federal associations. Another commenter noted that the releaseof customer information to third parties should be left for the customer,not the Bank Board, to decide. Two commenters suggested that all thirdparties be allowed, pursuant to a written contract, to have access to allrecords in order to perform all functions that the association or its servicecorporation is authorized to perform. Another of these commenters statedthat all those with a legitimate business need should be entitled to accessmembership information. Three commenters suggested that liberal disclosurerules would allow small institutions to compete with larger ones that canafford to offer some of these services in-house, and another noted thatliberalizing disclosure rules would serve to remove the competitive imbalancebetween state and federally chartered associations with respect to customerrecord accress. Four commenters stressed the importance of maintainingthe confidentiality of customers of Federal associations, suggesting thatconfidentiality is currently assured by releasing minimal information tovendors.With regard to the rule set forth in proposed andSection; 544.9-2(a)(4) thatan association's Supervisory Agent must pre-approve release of membershiplists to wholly owned service corporations and subsidiaries, six commentersresponded. All six commenters agreed that such an approval process wasunnecessary, unduly burdensome, and time-consuming. The commenters variouslysuggested that appropriate solutions would be a confidentiality agreementwhose terms were preapproved by the Board, or a requirement that all customerrecord requests be filed with the Board and automatically granted afterexpiration of a certain time period if not disapproved.In addition, five commenters objected that the regulations as proposedappear to prohibit reporting by Federal associations to consumer reportingagencies, in violation, the commenters stated, of Congressional intentexpressed in, for example, the Fair Credit Reporting Act. One of thesecommenters claimed that this places Federal associations at a competitivedisadvantage with commercial banks that do not operate under such strictures,because the credit reporting agencies will not sell credit informationabout prospective borrowers to financial institutions that do not report,and Federal associations will not be able to receive the names availablefrom credit reporting agencies in order to solicit new accounts.One commenter asked that the Board clarify whether it intends to make adistinction between only the names and addresses of customers and all otheraccount and loan information contained in customer records. Another commenterasked that the Board decide whether its regulations on this issue shouldbe phrased only in terms of a party's right to obtain customer recordsor whether the Board should accommodate an association's desire to turnover such records voluntarily to third parties.<ITAG tagnum="84">D. Board Reconsideration of Issues</ITAG>Based upon a thorough review of the comments submitted in response to theCorporate Governance Proposal Parts II, III, and IV, as well as upon considerationof other policy concerns, the Board has determined to revise its proposalconcerning disclosure of customer records by Federal associations and topublish its new proposals for comment.\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ At this time, the Board is proposing a rule dealing solelywith the issue of the confidentiality and release of customer records.Thus, in a companion document, the Board is proposing to withdraw onlythose current regulations that either conflict with or are redundant inlight of the regulations proposed today. Current regulatory provisionsconcerning only peripherally related issues, such as communication betweenmembers of Federal mutual associations and access to records by shareholdersof Federal stock associations, remain unaffected. In addition and by separateaction, the Board withdraws those regulatory provisions propoosed as partof Corporate Governance Parts II, III, and IV that concern the issue ofconfidentiality and release of customer records and are redundant or conflictwith this proposed rule.Until now, the Board's regulations concerning the confidentiality and disclosureof customer records have been separately applicable to Federal stock associationsand Federal mutual associations. The Board has made the determination thatit is more efficacious for these rules to appear in one regulatory section,applicable to all Federal associations. This determination accords withthe OGC opinions, previously mentioned, that, with regard to the releaseof customer records, the interests of Federal mutual associations and Federalstock associations are similar as are the interests of depositors in stockassociations and members of mutual associations.The Board also has reconsidered the issue of allowing release of customerrecords only to wholly owned service corporations or subsidiaries of theFederal association. The Board believes that it may not be justifiableto have a policy that distinguishes between release by a Federal associationof customer lists to its wholly owned service corporations or subsidiariesand release of customer lists to non-affiliated business entities thatengaged in the same activities. The Board is cognizant of the view thatsuch an expansion of the disclosure rules may serve to enhance the valueof a Federal charter; it specifically requests public comment on this point.The current system of review by Supervisory Agents of the circumstancesunder which a Federal association may disclose its customer records pursuantto current andSection; 545.131, modified in the most recent proposal of andSection;544.9-2, also has been reconsidered by the Board. The supervisory reviewprocess has produced differing supervisory guidelines in this area resultingin a lack of uniformity in approach to disclosure of customer records byFederal associations in different districts. The Board also has re-evaluatedthe review process in light of many commenters' objections that it wasunduly burdensome and time consuming. Accordingly, the Board has endeavoredin this proposed rule to clarify the circumstances in which customer recordsmay be disclosed. The Board also has determined to retain in this proposed rule the principlethat the prerogative to obtain and inspect a customer's own confidentialrecords resides with the customer. The Board also responds to a commenter'ssuggestion that the right to obtain such records be distinguished froman association's right to release such records voluntarily. The Board isof the view that the right to obtain and inspect belongs only to a customer,and not to third parties. The decision to release customer records overthe objection of customers is left to the Federal associations under strictlylimited circumstances. The Board has given much consideration and attention to the competing interestsof customer privacy and Federal associations' business needs raised bythe comments to the various Corporate Governance proposals. The Board understandsthat a Federal association cannot conduct its day-to-day business operationswithout freely releasing certain customer records to parties such as thosewho print checks and process customer mailings, whether they are actuallyin-house employees or third parties hired to perform such services. Withobservance of methods to safeguard customer confidentiality, as discussedbelow, the Board believes that customer records must be released to suchthird parties. However, many commenters strongly advocated that Federal associations beafforded the opportunity to release customer records voluntarily to manydifferent business entities, such as those offering mortgage life insurance,in the interest of the financial benefits of such transactions both toFederal associations and such business entities. In balancing the businessconcerns of the association with the privacy concerns of the customers,the Board is proposing the following compromise: a Federal associationmay freely release the names and addresses of each customer_<T3>i.e., </T3>customer identification_to any third party including thirdparty vendors of services <T3>unless </T3>the customer affirmatively and in writing prohibits theassociation from doing so; <T3>provided that </T3>the Federal association has given actual noticeof the customer's right to prohibit the release of customer identificationand of the intent of the Federal association to release such identification.Information consisting of names and addresses, however, in conjunctionwith other account records, is referred to as ``customer records.'' Asdiscussed in more detail below, customer records may only be released afterthe receipt of a customer's authorization procured by the Federal associationor pursuant to certain exceptions. While each customer would have the ability to prevent release of customerrecords and identification, the Board recognizes that there are overridingpractical and legal concerns that mandate release of confidential customerrecords to certain parties and entities despite objection by the customer.A Federal association cannot conduct daily operations that entail the preparationand handling of customer information without allowing reasonable accessto such records by employees or agents of the association. Similarly, aFederal association, in compliance with the Right to Financial PrivacyAct, must be able to cooperate with the Board and Federal Home Loan Bankemployees and agents who request customer records in order to perform theirduties with respect to Federal associations. Further, as the commenters emphasized, Federal associations should be allowedto communicate freely with credit reporting agencies in order to conductcertain basic financial operations such as examining the credit historyof loan applicants. Certain legal consideration such as the duty to respondto lawful subpoenas and to report to governmental bodies would also requirerelease of confidential customer records when required.Certain of these exceptions, however, must necessarily be accompanied bysafeguards designed to ensure their confidentiality. Therefore, when itcannot be assumed that confidentiality of customer records will be maintained,the Board believes that such disclosures should be accompanied by agreementsto protect the confidentiality of these records. Adoption of this proposal would preempt state law concerning the releaseof customer indentification and customer records by Federal associations.\3\<NOTE/> The Board has extensively reviewed state law concerning theserelated issues and has concluded that it varies widely. Moreover, statelaws do not, for the most part, address the Board's concern about the needto balance customer privacy against the business requirements of Federalassociations. Consequently, pursuant to its authority to regulate the operationsof Federal associations, the Board is proposing the following regulationsto preempt state law and exclusively govern the operations of Federal associationsin this regard. <T3>See</T3> 12 U.S.C. 1464(a) (1982 and Supp. VI 1988); 12 CFR 545.1 (1988);<T3>see e.g., Fidelity Fed. Sav. and Loan Ass'n v. de la Cuesta,</T3> 458U.S. 141, 164 (1983). The Board does, however, specifically request commenton whether it may me advisable to provide that state law governs disclosureinstead of following this suggested approach.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ The Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978, 12 U.S.C.3401 <T3>et seq</T3>., Pub. L. No. 95-630, Title XI, section 1100, 92 Stat.3697, provides a federal standard with respect to the release of customerrecords to federal governmental authorities. <ITAG tagnum="84">E. Description of This Proposal</ITAG>This proposed rule applies to customers, defined as depositors in, borrowersfrom, or other patrons of both Federal stock associations and Federal mutualassociations. It addresses the issue of the release of information aboutcustomers but distinguishes between two types of such information: customeridentification, defined as a list of the names and addresses of customers;and customer records, which include not only the names and addresses ofcustomers but also information about the contents and particulars of theirsavings or loan accounts or other financial transactions with the association.The proposed rule can be summarized in the following manner: (a) With certainenumerated exceptions, only a customer of a Federal association, and noother person or entity, has the right to inspect and obtain a customer'sown customer records; (b) Unless a customer affirmatively and in writingprohibits release of the customer <T3>identification,</T3> a Federal association may, in its discretion,voluntarily release customer identification to any person or entity, providedthat any release of customer identification shall consist only of a completelist of all customers who have not objected to the release of their customeridentification. Federal associations may not, therefore, release a partialor incomplete list of customer identification, such as, for example, alist of only depositors, or borrowers, or customers with account balancesover $50,000; and (c) With certain enumerated exceptions, a Federal associationis prohibited from releasing its customer <T3>records</T3>, other than customer identification, unless the Federalassociation procures from the customer written authorization for such release.The obligation to inform the customer of his or her right to object tothe release of customer identification and to obtain written authorizationfrom the customer to release customer records is specifically imposed uponthe Federal association. While the Board specifically requests commentson the methods available to Federal associations to implement this affirmativeresponsibility, the Board is proposing the following procedure. As to the release of customer identification, associations must notifycustomers of the association's intent to release customer identificationin a timely manner. In this context, the Board views ``timely'' as allowinga customer sufficient time to receive the notice, review it, consider thealternatives, and decide whether to object to the disclosure of his orher customer identification. Federal associations desiring to release customeridentification may provide the notice to new customers at the time an accountis opened, before a loan is made, or other financial transaction is enteredinto, and are authorized to release customer identification no sooner thanthirty (30) days thereafter. Written notice containing the opportunityto object to the release of customer identification must be provided toexisting customers along with a self-addressed envelope needing no postagein which the customer can return his or her objection to the Federal association.Federal associations may release customer identification no sooner thanthirty (30) days after providing existing customers with such notice andopportunity to object to the release of customer identification. If noticeis mailed, the thirty days would begin from the date of mailing. In anyevent, Federal associations may not release customer identification forthose customers that have provided written objection to such release. As to the responsibility of associations to inform customers of the possiblerelease of customer records, the Board also is proposing certain proceduresrequiring an association to procure a customer's informed consent beforecustomer records are released. No release of customer records is permitted unless a customer whose recordsare intended to be released is given notice that release is contemplated,that the customer need not approve the release, and that without the customer'sexpress written authorization for release, the association will not disclosecustomer records, except in certain enumerated circumstances. Furthermore,the association must retain a copy of the customer's authorization forits records. In this way, associations may sell or make publicly availabletheir customer records, and third parties can conduct direct mail solicitationsaimed at customers of Federal associations in a manner that respects theprivacy expectations of customers of Federal associations.Accordingly, the Board proposes that associations may use a standardizednotice and authorization form to solicit the consent to release customerrecords before such records are released. This document would be separatefrom any and all other documents that are provided to customers pursuantto law or regulation. Such a document would contain, for example, the following:1. The definition of customer records;2. A statement that the customer has the right to withhold consent to therelease of his or her customer records by the Federal association;3. A description of the types of businesses, organizations, or other personsor entities to whom customer records may be disclosed and the time period,not to exceed two years, in which such disclosures may be made;4. A statement that the Federal association may seek to obtain reauthorizationfrom the customer for the release of customer records after the expirationof that time period, or if release is contemplated to types of recipientsother than those for which authorization is sought;5. A statement that the customer may at any time provide the Federal associationwith written notice withdrawing the customer's prior consent to releasecustomer records and how and to whom such notice must be given;6. A statement as to the circumstances under which customer records maybe released even when not authorized by the customer but required by law;7. A statement authorizing the release of customer records; and8. A space for the customer's signature and for the date the document wasexecuted.The Board's proposal permits associations desiring to release customerrecords to provide this document to the customer at the time an accountis opened, before the customer becomes obligated for a loan, or at thetime the customer enters into another form of financial transaction withthe association. Federal associations that currently release customer recordsor that desire to release customer records pertaining to existing customersmust provide the notice to each existing customer before customers recordscan be released. While the Board notes that there may be various methodsavailable to accomplish this requirement, it believes that a mailing toall customers, including a self-addressed envelope needing no postage,would be the most expedient method. Such a document, for example, may beprovided to the customer with the customer's monthly account statement.The Board specifically seeks comment on the financial cost of compliancewith this requirement by Federal associations, on the effect such costsmay have on the ability of Federal associations to disclose customer identificationor records for business purposes or for a fee, and on the comparative effectssuch costs will have on large and small associations.In proposing these requirements, the Board recognizes that circumstancesmay change in regard to the release of customer records, both from theperspective of the Federal association and of the customer. Therefore,the Board is proposing that at least every two years after the initialprovision of the notice to customers, Federal associations desiring torelease customer identification and records shall mail to each customernew consent forms for the purpose of giving customers the opportunity toobject to the release of customer identification and of obtaining reauthorizationfor the release of customer records. If reauthorization from the customerfor release of customer records is not received, the Federal associationshall no longer continue to release such customer records. Of course, associationsmay provide such notice more frequently than every two years.The proposed form and requirements also reflect the Board's belief thatcustomers must be informed not only of the consequences of their decisionto consent to the release of customer records, but also of the intendeduse of such records. There are several methods available to achieve thisrequirement, such as requiring the disclosure of the names of the intendedrecipients of customer records, or requiring a general disclosure thatthe Federal association intends to release customer records to third parties.The Board believes an appropriate balance between these two alternativesis that Federal associations should specify in the notice document thetype or nature of business(es) that may receive customer records from theFederal association, <T3>e.g., </T3>insurance companies, credit card companies, department stores,or marketing agencies. The Board believes this method would advise customersof the intended scope of release of customer records without unreasonablyburdening Federal associations.The Board is aware that alternatives to these approaches exists. For example,associations could be required to procure a customer's informed consentto the release of customer records each time the association intends torelease such records and could be required to identify the intended recipient,the purpose of the release, and the date the records will be released.The Board specifically requests comments on this approach. The Board alsoseeks comment on whether the notice should be provided to each customereach time they enter into a transaction with the association (<T3>e.g., </T3>each time the customer opens a deposit account or takesout a loan) or whether one notice would be sufficient to cover all recordsof the customer during the stated time period.The proposed regulation sets out exceptions to this general non-disclosurerule. In addition to disclosure to the customer or to those authorizedby the customer, disclosure would be permitted to those employees or agentsof Federal associations responsible for preparing or handling customerrecords; officials, employees or agents of the Board, the Federal Savingsand Loan Insurance Corporation, or a Federal Home Loan Bank in the exerciseof their official duties; other financial institutions or consumer creditreporting agencies as part of a regular exchange of credit information;federal government agencies or entities requiring such information, reports,or returns pursuant to law; those parties who must be informed concerningthe dishonor of a negotiable instrument; appropriate law enforcement authoritieswhen an association reasonably believes it has been the victim of a crime;persons making demand pursuant to a lawful subpoena; and the association'sbond or insurance company relative to a claim under the association's liabilitypolicy.The proposal also provides that release of customer records to any personnot expressly enumerated in this section is permissible only after theassociation receives the prior written approval of the Board. The Boardbelieves that this exception should only apply in unusual and highly exceptionalcircumstances in which the ability to release customer lists is not contemplatedby any other exceptions to the non-disclosure rule. The Board specificallyasks for comment on the need to include this exception and, if included,on whether it should apply to the release of customer identification andrecords where the customer has acted to prohibit release, or whether itshould only apply to the release of customer records where the customer,while not objecting to the release, has not affirmatively authorized release.Because the continued confidentiality of customer records following releaseto the aforementioned excepted parties cannot always be assured, the proposedrule provides that the following parties must execute confidentiality agreementsprior to the release of customer records: (1) Parties to whom a customerhas authorized such release; (2) officers, employees, or agents of theFederal association responsible for preparing and handling customer records;(3) other financial institutions or credit reporting agencies; and (4)the association's bond or insurance companies. These confidentiality agreementsmust contain a statement of the specific use to be made of the recordsand prohibit disclosure by the third party except as required by law orin accordance with the exceptions set out in paragraphs (e) (3), (5), (7)and (8) as if these sections applied directly to the recipient of the records.Additionally, the Board specifically requests comments with respect towhether an exception to the nondisclosure rule should exist for the disclosureof customer records when state law, not otherwise preempted by Federallaw or regulations, requires such disclosure to state governmental authoritiesin the lawful exercise of such governmental authority over the customeror other third party.Finally, in order to avoid conflict with or repetition of current regulatoryprovisions dealing with the confidentiality and release of customer records,this rule proposes to delete such conflicting or repetitive provisions.Specifically, the proposed rule would delete paragraphs (a) and (b) ofandSection; 545.131 dealing with the disclosure of membership lists by aFederal mutual association and the right of inspection of a member's ownrecords. It would also delete paragraph (d) of andSection; 552.11, whichcontains a prohibition against release to stockholders of Federal stockassociations of confidential depositor information. It would also amendparagraph (d) of andSection; 545.141 to reflect the adoption of the disclosureprocedures and limitations of andSection; 545.132.<ITAG tagnum="84">Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</ITAG>Pursuant to section 3 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 603 (1982),the Board is providing the following initial regulatory flexibility analysis:1. <T3>Reasons, objectives, and legal basis underlying the proposed rule.</T3>These elements are incorporated above in the <T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION</T2> section.2. <T3>Small entities to which the proposed rule would apply.</T3> The proposedrule would apply to all Federal assocations without regard to size.3. <T3>Impact of the proposed rule on small entities.</T3> The proposed rulewould clarify the circumstances under which all Federal associations maydisclose customer identification and records for business purposes andfor a fee. The proposed rule, however, may have a disproportionate impacton small associations, since it may be more difficult for small associationsto afford the costs of the notice requirements. This could diminish theability of small institutions to profit from the sale of customers identificationor records. The Board specifically requests comment on this issue in thepreamble to the proposed rule.4. <T3>Overlapping or conflicting Federal rules.</T3> As explained in the<T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION</T2> section, the proposed rule is intendedto streamline the Board's regulations governing a Federal association'srelease of its customer records.
