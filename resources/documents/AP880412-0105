Iraq said the assault was repulsed.   Iraq reported it fired a long-range missile into Tehran and twointo the northwestern city of Tabriz. Shipping executives said Iranattacked and set ablaze a Saudi Arabian tanker in the Persian Gulf.   Iran said there were civilian casualties in the attacks on itscities. It did not specify how many.   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored inNicosia, claimed Iraqi warplanes today dropped chemical bombs onIranian troops in Sulaimaniyeh province as Iraq's forces werelosing ground in the latest offensive in the 7{-year-old war. IRNAsaid Iranian troops were equipped with gas masks and protectiveclothing, ``but many were injured.'' It did not elaborate.   It said heavy fighting was raging after the Iranians overran 12square miles of Iraqi territory. IRNA said Iranian jets twicebombed a headquarters of the Iraqi Army's 1st Corps at Kani Mizan,west of Penjwin, ``inflicting heavy damage,'' and carried out 25combat missions against ground targets.   IRNA said the Iranians advanced across the mountainous frontierMonday night near Penjwin, seizing six ``strategic heights'' togain a foothold in the region. That is 25 miles north of an Iranianbridgehead around Lake Darbandikhan seized in an offensive lastmonth.   In Baghdad, the official news agency quoted an Iraqi militaryspokesman as saying the latest Iranian assault was beaten back,with 2,000 men killed or wounded. ``Many were captured while theothers fled,'' the unidentified spokesman was quoted as saying.   There was no independent confirmation of either side's claims.Iran and Iraq rarely allow correspondents into the battle zones.   IRNA reported the advancing Iranians captured 235 Iraqis anddestroyed 45 tanks and armored personnel carriers, 1,000 vehiclesand 10 artillery guns. IRNA said gunners shot down an Iraqi PC-7aircraft, a Swiss-built propellor-driven trainer that can be usedin a combat role.   In Manama, Bahrain, shipping executives reported the raid on the36,904-ton Sagheera, Iran's first attack on gulf shipping thismonth.   The tanker was hit at 1 p.m. (5 a.m. EDT) off the emirate of Rasal-Khaimah in the southern gulf as it was sailing out of thewaterway with a full load of Saudi oil, said the executives,speaking on condition of anonymity.   The executives said the tanker's bow was set on fire.   The Iranians challenged the Sagheera by radio, demanding itsdestination and cargo, before it was attacked, the executives said.   The Iraqi News Agency agency reported the Iraqis fired along-range missile into Tabriz today. Iran said the missile hit ahospital for lepers, but said no reports on casualties wasavailable.   IRNA reported on Monday that Iranian-backed Iraqi rebels havekilled 680 Iraqi soldiers and destroyed four bases in northeastIraq in the last few days.   Iran said it fired two missiles at ``two key military targets''in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad on Monday in retaliation for Iraqimissiles that killed at least 20 civilians in Tehran and Isfahanearlier in the day.   IRNA reported that Iranian artillery also shelled the batteredthe Iraqi port city of Basra, the naval base at Umm Qasr and threeborder towns Monday.   The agency quoted the Iranian defense minister, Brig. Gen.Mohammed Hussein Jalali, as saying his country is now making mostof its own missiles and is capable of ``turning Baghdad into aninferno ... if the criminal attacks on Iranian cities continue.''   Since Feb. 29, the two sides have fired more than 300 missilesinto each other's cities.   At the United Nations on Monday, Iraq's deputy foreign minister,Wisam Alzahawi, said there is no point in continuing talks onending the Iran-Iraq war until Iran accepts a U.N. Security Councilpeace plan.   The Security Council passed a resolution in July 1987 demandingan immediate cease-fire and troop withdrawal as the first stepstoward a negotiated end to the war. Iraq endorsed the resolution;Iran has yet to do so.</TEXT></DOC>
