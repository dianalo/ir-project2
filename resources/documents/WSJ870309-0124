The company said the decision to change its name resulted from the November 1986 sale of its packaging operations to New York-based Triangle Industries Inc. for about $600 million in cash and stock. Included in the sale were rights to the American Can name.    Since 1982, American Can has sold more than 25 businesses and other assets that were either unprofitable or didn't mesh with the company's new strategy. It has invested the proceeds into such activities as mortgage banking, insurance, direct mail marketing and specialty store retailing.    American Can said the new name was chosen from among some 500 suggestions submitted by employees, a consulting firm and others associated with the company.    Shareholders will vote on the name change April 28 at the annual meeting. Following approval, the company's shares will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol PA. </TEXT></DOC>
