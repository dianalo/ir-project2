The purpose of this paper is to encourage the gas utilitymanagers and engineers to take notice of this new technology and startfactoring it into their planning strategies. The defined goal of distributionrobotics is to improve the quality of service, lower operating costs,reduce work hazards, and perform in situ tasks. Applications of the distributionrobotic system range from internal leak detection and repair to pipecondition assessment and cleaning; as stated, these applications areperformed in a live system. To achieve the desired application missions,the robotic system requires robots of different designs along with appropriatetools, peripherals, and external support systems. The robot consistsof several subsystems that allow motion, sensory perception, action andreaction, communication, and entering or existing the system. Each subsystemhas several choices for robot configurations with advantages and trade-offsfor the purpose, mode, range, and speed required by each mission. Externalsupport systems are required for a complete distribution robotic system.An external computer and human operator are needed as well as the physicalhardware necessary to support a robot operation. Finally, issues raisedby a distribution robotic system need consideration for proper planning.The major issues raised are robot miniaturization, obstacles, safety,coverage, and control.</TEXT></DOC>
