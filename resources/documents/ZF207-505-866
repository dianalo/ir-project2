(206) 882-8080.andM;List Price: Windows/286.andP;  $99; Windows/386.andP;  $195.andM;Requires: Windows/286: 512K RAM, graphics adapter, DOS 3.0 or later;Windows/386: 80386-based PC (2MB RAM recommended), graphics adapter, DOS 3.1or later.andM;In Short: The most popular graphical user interface for DOS, Windows promisesto make DOS more productive during its last years of widespread use.andP;  Newversions, due out this fall, are expected to address memory limitations andreplace the less-than-intuitive MS-DOS Executive.andM;Microsoft Windows is the most popular graphical user interface for DOS.andO;According to Microsoft Corp., over 2 million copies of Windows have been soldand distributed since its original release in November 1985.andP;  Windows,Version 2.1, is available in two flavors--Windows/286, priced at $99, andWindows/386, which costs $195.andM;Although application support for Windows was initially sparse, it has beenincreasing in recent years and is quickly approaching critical mass.andP;  Toencourage application support, Microsoft licenses a runtime version ofWindows to developers free of charge; they in turn make the program availableto end users.andP;  The runtime version allows you to use the application you'vepurchased, although it doesn't give you the benefits--such as contextswitching--that the full Windows environment provides.andM;The primary purpose of Windows is to run programs especially written for theGUI, such as Microsoft Excel, Aldus Corp.'s PageMaker, Micrografx Designer,and Samna Corp.'s Ami.andP;  Windows runs these programs in overlappingrectangular windows on the video display and allows the user to switch amongthem with keyboard and mouse.andP;  This gives users a flexibility in moving amongapplications that is more akin to the way people actually work.andM;For these programs, Windows provides a wealth of user interface components(menus, scroll bars, dialog boxes, buttons, and list boxes) that help givethe applications a consistent interface.andP;  Microsoft also publishes a WindowsStyle Guide that instructs programmers on recommended standards.andP;  The resultis that every Windows program that stores documents as files has a File menuwith an Open option that opens an existing document file.andP;  Once you'velearned how to use one Windows program, you know how to use them all.andM;DEVICE INDEPENDENCEandM;Windows also has a device-independent graphics interface known as GDI(Graphics Device Interface).andP;  Programs use GDI to display graphics and texton the screen and on hard copy devices such as printers, plotters, anddigital cameras.andP;  Windows is shipped with device drivers that support manypopular video display boards and printers, shifting the burden of supportingvarious graphics output devices from the application to the operatingenrivonment.andP;  Thus the disks full of printer drivers commonly shipped withDOS applications are not required for Windows programs.andP;  Moreover, mostWindows programs are written so that they treat the screen and printer in adevice-independent manner.andP;  When new video boards become available, allthat's needed is a Windows device driver; existing Windows applications cantake advantage of the new hardware without any modifications.andM;Programs written for Windows can share and exchange data through the Windowsclipboard.andP;  A protocol known as DDE (Dynamic Data Exchange) allows programsto transfer data through interactive links.andP;  For example, a bar graphdisplayed in Micrografx's Graph Plus can reflect changes to data in anotherapplication, such as a spreadsheet in Excel.andM;Perhaps the most sophisticated aspect of Windows is its memory management.andO;Although Windows runs in real mode under DOS, the memory management usestechniques normally available only under protected mode.andP;  Windows can movecode and data segments in memory, discard code segments from memory andreload them from .EXE files, and allow programs to share code and datalocated in dynamic-link libraries.andP;  For example, the code that handles themenu logic in Windows is located in a dynamic-link library.andP;  Only one copy ofthis code need be present in memory for all Windows applications to use it.andO;This sharing of code helps decrease the memory requirements of individualWindows applications.andP;  (Dynamic linking is one of several concepts originallydeveloped for Windows that have been carried over into OS/2 and thePresentation Manager).andM;The primary difference between the two versions of Windows 2.1 lies in theway then run DOS programs that were not written for the Windows environment.andO;Under Windows/286, Windows usually has to step out of the way and give a DOSapplication the full screen.andP;  Windows/386 uses the &quot;virtual 8086&quot; mode of80386 micro-processors to window and multitask virtually all DOS programs.andM;CRACKS IN THE WINDOWSandM;Windows currently has two major failings.andP;  (For information on otherfrustrations with Windows, see the sidebar &quot;What's Wrong with Windows?&quot;) Thefirst is the MS-DOS Executive, a file-management program that comparesunfavorably with many DOS shells.andP;  The MS-DOS Executive is almost entirelynongraphical; the main window provides little more than the equivalent of aDIR command.andP;  For people who know how to use DEL, COPY, and RENAME,performing these functions under the MS-DOS Executive is more difficult thanusing the DOS command line.andP;  (Several utilities from other softwaremanufacturers--such as Publishing Technologies' PubTech File Organizer,Wilson WindowWare's Command Post, hDC Computer Corp.'s hDC Windows Express,Matesys's Simple Win, and Romberg andamp; Romberg's Smart Win--provide friendlierenvironments for maintaining files and/or starting programs.andP;  And if you wantto write your own utilities, Softbridge's Bridge/286 and Bridge/386 offer afull-fledged batch language for Windows.)andM;Perhaps the most serious problem with Windows is the operating system underwhich it runs.andP;  DOS was not designed for multitasking and is limited to 640Kmemory.andP;  Windows provides support for expanded memory.andP;  But, like anybank-switched memory scheme, expanded memory cannot be used by applicationsas transparently as normal addressable memory.andP;  Using expanded memory candegrade program performance.andM;Windows 3.0 (to be released later this year) is expected to address these twoproblems.andP;  The MS-DOS Executive is being replaced with a more sophisticatedand intuitive interface for starting programs and performing file management.andO;To conquer the memory limitations under real mode, Windows 3.0 will useprotected mode to run well-behaved Windows applications.andP;  Support forprotected mode will allow Windows programs to transparently use memory abovethe 640K DOS limit, giving them much more elbowroom and significantlyimproved performance.andM;PRODUCTIVE DOSandM;Although many observers expect the OS/2 Presentation Manager to eventuallyreplace Windows as the GUI of choice on PC-compatible machines, Windows willhelp make DOS tolerable and more productive during its last few years ofwidespread use.andP;  Furthermore, judging from the improvements expected inWindows 3.0, it's obvious that Microsoft is not abandoning Windows and willcontinue to make it better.andM;When is the time right for you to put Windows on your machine?andP;  As with anyoperating system or environment, a decision to move to Windows should bebased on the availability of desirable Windows applications.andP;  If the only twoDOS applications you run are Lotus 1-2-3 and WordPerfect, there is littlereason to even think about Windows.andP;  But if you want to fire up Excel andAmi, then you should be using at least a runtime version of Windows (whetheryou want to or not!).andO;</TEXT></DOC>
