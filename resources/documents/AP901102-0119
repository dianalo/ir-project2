(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Next week's election has nothing to do withthe timing of the announcement that long-awaited jetties will bebuilt in the treacherous Oregon Inlet, Sen. Jesse Helms said.   The announcement came Thursday, almost a week after a stormtossed a dredge through the Herbert C. Bonner Bridge, knocking outa 370-foot section and isolating Hatteras Island.   Helms and Gov. Jim Martin said it was that accident, notpolitical motives, that led opponents to reach an agreement on thejetties.   ``That got their attention,'' Helms said, speaking of severalfederal agencies involved in the issue. ``I think it brought themtogether and they agreed, for the first time, something needed tobe done and should have een done earlier.''   On Thursday, U.S. Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinnerpresented a $2.5 million check to state Secretary of TransportationTommy Harrelson to go toward rebuilding the bridge's missingsegment. Skinner said the check represents the federal government's80 percent share of the repair costs.   The presentation was made during a campaign news conferencecalled by Helms in Greensboro. Helms, a three-term Republicansenator, is in a close re-election race in Tuesday's electionagainst Democrat Harvey Gantt.   A letter Helms carried to the news conference from U.S. InteriorSecretary Manuel Lujan Jr. said permits for the construction of thejetties would be forthcoming in six to eight months.   ``The jetties will save the fishing industry of North Carolinain that area,'' Helms said.   Commercial fishing boats use Oregon Inlet to travel between theAtlantic Ocean and a seafood processing center in Wanchese.   Twenty-six people have been killed in accidents in the inletduring the last 26 years, Martin said. The jetties are designed toprevent the inlet from becoming clogged with sand.   Fishermen, environmentalists and politicians have fought for twodecades over the jetties.   Environmentalists fear the jetties would cause erosion of nearbyOuter Banks beaches in the Cape Hatteras National Seashore and thePea Island National Wildlife Refuge.   The jetties agreement came after the Army Corps of Engineerssaid it would give the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and theNational Park Service, which control land access on both the northand south sides of Oregon Inlet, a voice in the project's design,Helms said.   Earlier estimates were that the jetties would cost $115 million,Helms said. But changes that make the design more environmentallysound also bring down the cost to $84 million, he said.   Preliminary plans call for one-mile stone jetties to be built oneach side of the inlet between Bodie and Hatteras islands on DareCounty's Outer Banks.   Still, the jetties have some opponents.   A Duke University marine geology professor, Orrin Pilkey, saidthe jetties will cause even more erosion on the Outer Banks.   ``In the next few years, we should see severe erosiondownstream, which is already happening,'' Pilkey said. ``Highway 12is on the brink of being lost with every storm.''</TEXT></DOC>
