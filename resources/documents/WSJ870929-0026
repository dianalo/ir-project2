Industrial Engineering, which already has a representative on Triton's board, said its stock purchases are for investment purposes and to influence the energy company's &quot;current performance, corporate structure and its current financing methods.&quot; Its comments were made in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission.    Triton's stock closed in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday at $23 a share, up 87.5 cents.    Earlier this year, Triton elected John P. Lewis, who heads a Dallas acquisition and investment concern, as a Triton director. Mr. Lewis was nominated by Peter Yunghanns of Industrial Engineering, Triton said.    Charles B. Crowell, Triton's vice president and general counsel, said Triton viewed the latest stock acquisition as routine and hadn't any other comments. Industrial Engineering, Victoria, Australia, had owned 991,000 Triton shares, or about a 6.8% stake. Triton has about 14.9 million shares outstanding and plans a public offering next month of at least three million common shares.    Last month, as previously reported, Triton said that New Zealand investor Robert Brierley indicated that he plans to acquire Triton stock and may try to control or acquire the company. Brierley Investments Ltd., Wellington, New Zealand, has recently received permission from federal regulators to acquire more than $15 million in Triton stock, Triton said. Triton said yesterday that it isn't clear whether Brierley currently holds any Triton shares but in Brierley's filings with the federal government last month Triton said Brierley indicated that it already holds some Triton shares. A U.S.-based company that is affiliated with Mr. Brierley wouldn't comment on any Triton stock holdings Brierley may now have. </TEXT></DOC>
