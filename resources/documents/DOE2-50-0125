A three-dimensional numerical model ofthe area between Death Valley and the Great Salt Lake was developed tohelp conceptualize the hydrogeology of this aquifer system and to determinethe effects of geologic structures on ground-water flow within the system.The aquifer system was simulated with two layers in which the upper layerrepresents flow of intermediate depth--several thousand feet--throughcarbonate- and volcanic-rock mountain ranges and adjacent alluvial basins.The lower layers represents deeper regional flow primarily through carbonaterocks. Known heads and estimates of discharges from springs and evapotranspirationwere used to calibrate the transmissivities and leakance values for themodel. Abrupt changes in transmissivity and head simulated in the modelcorrespond to the locations of broad structural features including faults,major lineaments, and magnetic anomalies. Model results clearly portraythe concept of local, intermediate, and regional flow within the aquifersystem. About 80 hydrographic areas within the province may representlocal flow; 17 individual regions were simulated in the upper model layerrepresenting intermediate flow; and only 5 regions were simulated inthe lower model layer representing regional flow. Flow budgets suggestseveral areas favorable for future exploration for ground-water supplies.</TEXT></DOC>
