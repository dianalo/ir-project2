A beam steering system employingclosed orbit feedback has been designed and installed to stabilize thebeam in both planes. In each plane of motion, beam position is measuredwith a beam position detector and a correction signal is fed back toa local four magnet orbit bump to dynamically control the angle of theradiation at the source. This paper describes the design and performanceof the beam steering system.</TEXT></DOC>
