(miscellaneous topics) (column)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Manes, Stephen.andM;</AUTHOR><SUMMARY>Copy protection, previously a bone of contention between users andsoftware publishers, is increasingly rare although some computergames are still protected.andP;  Such a practice has not deterred manyhardware vendors who are marketing 'foolproof' devices to preventunauthorized access to programs.andP;  One device took 30 minutes toinstall, and still did not work.andP;  It did succeed in haltingcommunication to the printer, however.andP;  The best rule of copyprotection is not to trust the program if the program is not goingto trust the user.andP;  The increased use of CD-ROM drives brings upthe question of whether CDs themselves are as indestructible asmanufacturers claim.andP;  It is believed that the ink used to print onthe CDs may actually be slowly eating away at the informationstored on the disks.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Software packagesSoftware ProtectionCD-ROMUsed Equipment.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Stephen Manes Leftover opinions!andP;  Unsold insights!andP;  They're all discounted tomove off the lot here at the Stephen Manes Column's first annual year-endclearance!andP;  Act fast and take advantage of our wide selection of compactspeculations--all the content of a full-size idea distilled to a few pithyparagraphs.andP;  We're eager to clear out our 1989 musings, mutterings, andgripes to make way for the brand-new 1990s, so make your best deal now!andP;  Justlook at some of these beauties:andM;* A real steal.andP;  Once the hottest of topics, copy protection has witheredaway, as even the most avaricious diehards have abandoned it.andP;  Just a coupleof years back, a cadre of the editors of this magazine sat in a hotel roomwith the minions of a particular vendor and gave them an hour of unmitigatedgrief about their imbecilic copy protection policy.andP;  Eventually the vendordug deep into what passed for its soul and removed copy protection from itsproducts once and for all.andM;A couple of months ago a couple of guys from the company waylaid me at atrade show.andP;  &quot;We just want to tell you how right you were about copyprotection.andP;  Thank you.&quot;andM;I was stunned.andP;  It may well have been a first.andP;  In this business, the usualresponse to criticism is anything but gratitude.andP;  &quot;Our sales are up about 200percent,&quot; the beaming executive went on.andP;  &quot;We'd never have believed it if wehadn't seen it for ourselves.&quot;andM;So is copy protection finally extinct?andP;  Not on your disk drive!andP;  Gameprograms still use it, or compromise with a dimly inked, hard-to-copy sheetof data, some of which has to be entered before you can play.andP;  Misplace thesheet and you're out of luck, but at least you can install the game on yourhard disk without worrying about some wacky nonstandard hidden file thatdestroys your data when you least expect it.andM;A particularly toasty circle of hell is reserved for the bozos and dimbulbsacross the country who keep inventing &quot;foolproof&quot; hardware contraptions toprevent unauthorized access--mostly to programs no one in his right mindwould bother with anyway.andP;  There seem to be dozens of these schemes, but Ihadn't seen one in action lately until somebody sent me a mammoth and vaguelyinteresting program that came complete with a doohicky that attaches&quot;transparently&quot; to the parallel port (or was that &quot;opaquely&quot;).andM;THEY DIDN'T THINKandM;You'd think the fact that the software takes half an hour to install would bea major deterrent to theft, but the vendor didn't think.andP;  Before I could eventouch the program, I had to find a screwdriver and apply it to the back of mymachine.andP;  Then, after spending 30 fun-filled minutes watching disk drivelights and cryptic on-screen messages, I needed only 10 more to discover theprogram couldn't do even remotely what it was supposed to.andP;  Since the vendorapologized and promised a new set of disks, I blithely left the gizmo inplace on the parallel port.andM;A couple of days later, I turned on my printer and sent a document its way.andO;Alas, the printer had gone deaf to my computer.andP;  It took me only 10 minutesof agony to remember that the infernal &quot;transparent&quot; copy protection devicewas still attached.andP;  Removing it solved the problem instantly.andM;The Iron Law of Copy Protection remains: If the program doesn't trust you,don't trust it.andM;* Rustproofing additional.andP;  CD-ROM vendors have long touted the medium'ssupposed indestructibility.andP;  Recent rumors wafing through the industry,however, suggest that the inks used to label the disks can conceivablydestroy the reflective coating they're printed on, and thus the disks'readability.andM;Maybe so.andP;  Maybe not.andP;  But last spring my friend Wannabee Tycoon used aCD-ROM disk as a Frisbee in an attempt to drive geese from his lakefrontlawn.andP;  The geese stuck around; the CD-ROM ended up in the drink.andM;Months later, on a warm midsummer day, Tycoon, with benefit of snorkel,retrieved the disk from the lake bottom--pitted, marred, mottled, its labelnearly unreadable.andP;  After carefully cleaning and drying the disk, I slippedit into a CD-ROM drive, and--voila!--the system refused even to recognize thedisk's existence.andM;* Warranted forever.andP;  In the months after I bought my Kenmore washer anddryer, I could count on an almost weekly mid-dinner phone call about thewonders of the Sears Service Contract.andP;  What a wonderful marketing strategy:first, sell the product, and then imply that it's likely to break the minutethe warranty runs out!andP;  Polite refusals and requests for cessation of thecalls failed to deter the intrepid Sears telemarketers; it took a screamingfit worthy of Sam Kinison to do the trick.andM;AMERICAN KNOW-NOTandM;In the same spirit of American know-not comes Prodigy, Sears's joint computerventure with IBM.andP;  Their PR flacks gave me a complimentary subscription tothis on-line so-called &quot;service.&quot;andP;  I tested it, detested it, wrote mean andnasty things about it, and put it out of my mind.andM;That is, until the bills started arriving.andP;  They now add up to $54.19, whichis a whole mess of enchiladas for a service that's basing a lot of itsputative appeal on its putative low cost.andP;  Prodigy's customer service folkshave been every bit as competent as its designers--repeated phone callsexplaining the problem have been utterly useless.andM;And I'm not the only journalist who's run into this problem.andP;  So pleaseexcuse this Kinisonian rant: Listen, you turkeys!andP;  Account number 2801 10 0090030581 was a complimentary account!andP;  I told you, I told you, and I done toldyou!andP;  I canceled, I canceled, and I recanceled, yet you keep sending thesebills!andP;  Now get off my case!!andM;* A pointed rebuttal.andP;  Less than 24 hours after the final version of mycolumn two issues ago, extolling the Isopoint key pointing device, was graveimmutably in pixels, a party conversion called the whole thing into question.andO;&quot;You know,&quot; said my friend Hardweird, &quot;you seem to have overlooked anadvanced pointing interface known to millions of users and gaining a millionor so every month.andP;  It's so simple every kid in America already knows how touse it.andP;  And, dollars to donuts, somebody will eventually adapt it for thePC.&quot;andP;  With that he reached down to the floor beneath his TV set and picked uphis kid's Nintendo game controller.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
