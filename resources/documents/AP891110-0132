Bosch has 50 days to appeal a judge's ruling Wednesday thatupheld the government decision to deport him. But if he notifiesthe government in writing that he won't appeal, he could bedeported as soon as the State Department can find a country toaccept him.   ``He feels that to appeal would be giving his approval to thejudicial limbo in which he has been kept,'' Mrs. Bosch saidThursday.   Bosch's attorneys say they'll give him some time to reconsiderbefore notifying the government that he won't appeal.   Bosch, 63, has been at the Metropolitan Correctional Centersince Feb. 16, 1988, when he flew to Miami from Venezuela. He spent11 years in Venezuelan prisons on charges he masterminded thebombing of a Cuban jetliner in 1976 that killed 73 people.   Bosch never was convicted of those charges, but the U.S.Attorney General office maintained that his anti-Castro activitiesmake him a threat to national security.   Immigration experts say it will be difficult for the governmentto find a country that will accept Bosch, who would likely beaccompanied by his wife. A Justice Department spokesman refused tocomment, other than to restate the government's promise not to sendBosch to Cuba, where a death sentence awaits him.   The pending deportation provoked anger among Miami's exilecommunity, many of whom regard Bosch as a tireless campaigneragainst Cuban leader Fidel Castro.</TEXT></DOC>
