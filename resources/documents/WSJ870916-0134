Under a 1985 contract, the Chinese and McDonnell Douglas currently are assembling 25 of the company's 155-seat MD-82 aircraft at a Shanghai, China, plant. Boeing, which has sold 52 U.S.(built aircraft to China and in return has purchased some Chinese-made parts for its 747 and 737 jetliners, currently doesn't assemble aircraft overseas.    Boeing said the Chinese are meeting with company officials in Seattle this week, and St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas said meetings are scheduled for next week in Long Beach, Calif. A Boeing spokesman called its meetings &quot;very preliminary&quot; and said it isn't clear how any program would be structured or whether contracts might be signed with both companies.    The Chinese are interested in medium-range aircraft similar to Boeing's 140-seat 737s and 180-seat 757s, Boeing said. The McDonnell Douglas aircraft under consideration would be part of its MD-80 series, a spokesman said.    A spokesman for Airbus Industrie, the European aircraft consortium producing the 150-seat A-320 jetliner, said he didn't know whether the Chinese would meet with Airbus officials. </TEXT></DOC>
