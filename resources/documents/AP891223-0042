SEWARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Thousands of East Berliners poured throughnew Berlin Wall border crossings at the Brandenburg Gate today fora final, frantic day of Christmas shopping in the well-stockedstores of the West.   Other Berliners headed for home after singing and dancing lateinto the night at the newly opened gate, which has been transformedfrom a symbol of Germany's divisions into one of East-Westrapprochement.   Although visa-free travel for West Germans to East Germanytechnically does not take effect until Sunday, there were fewformalities at the Brandenburg Gate, opened only Friday, for thosewho headed East today.   Throughout the night Friday, a steady clink of metal againststone accompanied the merrymakers as hundreds of souvenir seekerschipped away at the Berlin Wall near the gate in the 28-year-oldBerlin Wall.   At other crossing points, East German shoppers laden withpurchases from West Berlin carried Christmas presents, cases ofbeer and bags of oranges.   West German television periodically carried live coverage of thefestivities Friday night, showing the crowd dancing on top of thewall, popping champagne corks and waving sparklers.   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and East German Premier HansModrow met Friday for the second time in a week at a ceremonyformally opening two border crossings in the wall just north andsouth of the towering gate.   Security collapsed as soon as the two crossings were opened.Thousands of people pushed down metal barriers erected to controlthe crowd and swept through the vast Paris square, snaking throughthe gate and climbing the wall.   West Berlin police estimated that more than 30,000 people hadgathered on the Western side for the ceremony. The crowd on theEastern side appeared to be much larger, but there were no officialestimates.   Although more than 20 border crossings have been cut through theBerlin Wall since East Germany opened its borders to the West onNov. 9, the opening of the Brandenburg Gate was the emotionalclimax of the rapid merger of the people divided since the end ofWorld War II.   The openings resulted from a popular uprising in East Germanythat drove out its hard-line Communist leaders.   When the Berlin Wall was built in 1961, the Brandenburg Gate,Berlin's most famous landmark that straddled a main prewarthoroughfare, remained in the East. It was also inaccessible toEast Berliners until Friday because it was part of the off-limitEast German border zone.   The crowd carried Berlin, West German and East German flags. Onelarge sign saying in English ``Come Together'' was held aloft byseveral people who climbed atop the wall.   The thick section of the wall directly in front of the gateremains, but hundreds climbed on top to dance and hug in joyfulscenes reminiscent of the time when the borders were first openedin November.   Kohl said the opening of the gate was a ``fantastic thing.''   He and Modrow met Friday afternoon on the border line, shookhands and then walked together to a platform to address the crowd.   The two leaders were nearly mobbed by the exultant crowd assecurity officials tried in vain to establish some control.   The ceremony was broadcast live on both countries' nationaltelevision.   ``This is where the heart of Berlin pounds,'' said a commentatorfor West Germany's ZDF network.   Modrow reminded the crowd of the role the gate has played inGerman history, then said its new function should be ``to serve thepeace.''   Kohl said, ``This is the happiest day in my life, because I feelthat here in Berlin I am standing in the middle of Germany.''   ``We need the sympathy, the support and the approval of ourneighbors'' as the two Germanys move closer together, he said. ``Wewant peace and freedom.''   The speeches were drowned out by the noisy crowd. Many peoplehad tears in their eyes as they mingled together.   ``Berlin, have fun now,'' West Berlin mayor Walter Momper toldthe crowd.</TEXT></DOC>
