But the uproar over steroid use by Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson and other world-class athletes overshadows an even more ominous trend: a growing appetite for the muscle-building drugs among fitness buffs, student athletes and skinny youths yearning to bench-press like an Arnold Schwarzenegger.    &quot;Bulging muscles are in,&quot; says Don Leggett, an official of the federal Food and Drug Administration. &quot;Guys want to look good at the beach. High-school kids think steroids may enhance their ability to get an athletic scholarship, play pro sports or win the girl of their heart. Steroid use in this country has spread down to general people.&quot;    The Johnson case, some people have hoped, may take some of the shine off steroids. After all, the runner's positive test has cost him a gold medal, adulation, a new 100-meter-dash world record, and millions in endorsement money. But the reverse may be happening. &quot;Since the Ben Johnson episode, kids are coming into gyms asking for steroids because they want to run faster,&quot; says Bob Goldman, chief physician and chairman of the drug testing committee of the International Federation of Body Builders.    Now illicit steroids are a $100 million-a-year market, federal authorities say. And now, supplanting the doctors who have improperly given athletes the drugs, the real experts of the dope-supply business are getting involved: gangs of narcotics traffickers. &quot;Steroids constitute a growing threat to our national health and safety,&quot; warned Gene Haislip, a Drug Enforcement Administration official, in House testimony recently.    Steroids are not, however, on the list of substances the DEA goes after. And, reflecting the drugs' ambiguous image, the effort to suppress them faces an unusual problem: Steroids are also used by some iron-pumping police officers.    Anabolic steroids are synthetic hormones developed to prevent the wasting away of muscle in debilitating illnesses. In healthy people, they promote muscle strength and mass. But prolonged use can also lead to stunted growth in youngsters, high blood cholesterol, kidney disease and even fatal liver cancer. Because anabolic steroids are similar to the male hormone testosterone, they can prompt a male's body to make less of its own testosterone, resulting in shrunken testicles and feminized breasts.    The drug, either oral or injected, is approved for only a few disorders, among them certain cases of anemia and breast cancer.    Increasingly, steroids now are smuggled into the U.S. from Mexico or Europe, then dispensed by mail or through health clubs and gyms. Gyms &quot;are a hotbed&quot; for steroid sales, says Dr. Goldman of the body-builders federation. &quot;Kids who work in these gyms make $4, $5 an hour,&quot; he says. &quot;Now some are making $1,000 a week in cash selling steroids. Membership in some gyms isn't going that well, so they start a steroid business. They make a lot more from that than from memberships.&quot;    Jesse Ventura, a former professional wrestler, says a steroid dealer pays almost daily visits to the suburban Minneapolis gym he goes to. &quot;He stays for an hour or two. He claims he only makes $10,000 a year on steroids. Yet he drives a $70,000 Turbo Porsche.&quot;    The markup certainly is attractive. A steroid advertised as Dianabol retails for $5 a bottle in Tijuana, Mexico (no prescription is needed). Traffickers peddle it for $18 a bottle to U.S. dealers, who sell it to users for about $50 a bottle. And the merchandise moves. Some big-time traffickers have notified their dealers that they won't accept orders under $100,000.    Traffickers typically store the steroids in stash houses, &quot;then rent an office and do a mail-order business,&quot; says William Gately, a Customs agent in Phoenix. &quot;They send out price lists to people with access to major health clubs. They take orders over the phone, then send the steroids through U.S. mail or overnight delivery. Payments are sent in cash.&quot;    Dealers speak in code when ordering. Two bottles of injectable Dianabol may be &quot;D-2,&quot; for instance, says narcotics investigator Steven Stogsdill, of Grand Junction, Colo. A multi-state team he is part of is investigating a California-based network suspected of shipping steroids in Texas, Kansas, Oklahoma, Nevada, Ohio, Missouri, and Louisiana.    To the traffickers, this is serious business. According to criminal charges filed in San Diego federal court last year, when a man in Phoenix reneged on a steroid deal, his supplier sent an emissary named Leonard T. Swirda. Mr. Swirda took along an accomplice carrying a 12-inch club, a double-edged knife and leather gloves weighted with metal, says the indictment, which accuses Mr. Swirda of beating and cutting the dealer. In a separate action, Mr. Swirda last May was indicted for cocaine trafficking in a Spokane, Wash., federal court. He has pleaded innocent in both cases.    More than half the steroids smuggled into the U.S. are counterfeit, bearing the names of reputable manufacturers. Most supplies come from Mexico. While often just as effective, some of the counterfeits are produced in makeshift, unsanitary labs and are of dubious purity, lawmen say.    Mexican-made steroids might have had tragic consequences at a small college in Rangely, Colo. A student at Colorado Northwestern Community College was arrested in April for peddling steroids to fellow students. The 19-year-old bought them in Juarez, Mexico, for $400 and resold them for 10 times that, to 10 to 25 students at the school in Rangely, Colo. &quot;These were men and women interested in amateur athletics, basketball and weightlifting,&quot; says the Rangely police chief, Alan Pfeuffer.    When chemists tested the steroids, they found high concentrations of cortisone, a different kind of steroid that is a byproduct of anabolic-steroid manufacture and is supposed to be removed. When injected, it could kill a person who was allergic to it, and in any case cortisone use needs to be cut gradually to avoid severe side effects. The Rangely police chief hurriedly offered students a doctor's aid in getting off cortisone, and several took him up on it.    The Mexican sources of steroids are quite handy. It is a mere 20-minute drive from San Diego to the Hotel Fiesta Americana in Tijuana, where, in Suite 408, United Pharmaceuticals of Mexico offers &quot;unlimited quantities&quot; of steroids at &quot;unbeatable prices,&quot; according to a sales brochure. On a wall is a poster of a woman pumping iron.    The receptionist hands a reporter a price list. &quot;Tell your friends there is no prescription necessary to obtain steroids,&quot; the list says. And: &quot;We happily accept American Express and Master Cards.&quot;    Three bottles said to be steroids cost $58.89 in U.S. cash. One contains tablets, the other two an injectable liquid. The labels suggest the drugs come from prominent pharmaceutical makers. The bottle of Dianabol, for example, bears the name &quot;Ciba Geigy&quot; of Colon, Panama. But the Swiss-based drug giant never made Dianabol in Panama, halted all production world-wide in 1982 and destroyed its inventory, according to a U.S. Ciba-Geigy spokeswoman.    The firm in Suite 408, United Pharmaceuticals of Mexico, is a leader in the illicit steroid market, according to a U.S. indictment filed in San Diego last year. It also names the firm's affiliate, Laboratorios Milano de Mexico, and its owner, Juan Macklis. Neither Mr. Macklis -- a Mexican citizen also known as John Fontana -- nor his companies have answered the criminal charges. He is considered a fugitive, a prosecutor says.    Traffickers ship Mexican steroids to the U.S. concealed in vehicles, says Kenneth Ingleby, a U.S. Customs official in San Diego. Delivery people, called &quot;mules,&quot; get $600 to $1,500 a shipment. A mule typically deposits his shipment in a motel room inside the U.S. border. Then the purchaser, after paying cash to the Mexican supplier, receives motel-room keys, collects the order and is gone.    U.S. Justice officials claim some success against steroid traffickers: They have obtained federal convictions or guilty pleas from 60 individuals in the past 30 months, and 120 more people face charges. Rising prices suggest that the arrests have caused some shortages, says Philip L.B. Halpern, an assistant U.S. attorney in San Diego.    Mr. Macklis's operation was badly hurt last year with the arrest of &quot;numerous individuals&quot; he had hired to smuggle steroids, according to the indictment. Turning to free-lancers, Mr. Macklis asked Eric F. Kelly to smuggle &quot;approximately $100,000 worth of steroids each week&quot; into the U.S. for a single customer, according to federal charges against Messrs. Macklis and Kelly. Mr. Kelly pleaded guilty to a conspiracy-fraud charge last November.    But despite Justice Department claims, many steroid traffickers seem to stay one step ahead of the law. To avoid border risks, some traffickers have begun manufacturing in the U.S. At least one clandestine lab has been shut down: Fountain Valley Research Laboratories Inc., 35 miles south of Los Angeles. Operated by Jeffrey Feliciano, the lab produced what were billed as East German steroids. The labels read: &quot;Eigentum Der DDR -- Versenden Gesetzlich Verboten&quot; -- &quot;Property of GDR, export prohibited.&quot;    The steroids fetched a premium $180 per bottle. &quot;East German steroids are rated the best,&quot; says a California lawman. &quot;Their athletes have the reputation of being better, bigger and stronger.&quot;    Earlier this year, Mr. Feliciano pleaded guilty in a Westminster, Calif., state court to conspiracy to make steroids illegally, drawing a one-year jail sentence. He also faces a federal charge, to which he has pleaded innocent.    The Drug Enforcement Administration's 2,800 agents aren't apt to be on the trail of steroid dealers anytime soon. A bill in the House would give the DEA jurisdiction, but the drug agency itself opposes the bill. It says it doesn't have the resources. Unauthorized steroid sale now is a misdemeanor, though legislation moving through Congress would make it a felony.    Another problem is that dogs used by U.S. Customs agents to sniff out concealed heroin and cocaine so far haven't been able to detect steroids.    Then there's the matter of local police departments. Some policemen -- how many, nobody knows -- themselves use illicit steroids to increase physical strength. &quot;It's a macho thing,&quot; says a U.S. prosecutor. &quot;This is a matter of concern. A cop buying steroids from somebody isn't out to see that guy get busted.&quot;    As such use suggests, convincing users that anabolic steroids are bad remains a serious obstacle. It is undeniable that steroids build strength. &quot;The temptation is powerful,&quot; says Mr. Ventura, the former pro wrestler. &quot;I took oral steroids, 15 milligrams per day. In 30 days, my bench press went from 315 pounds to 390 pounds. Normally, it takes six months.&quot;    Mr. Ventura, 37, says he quit anabolic steroids in 1981, because &quot;I didn't want to tear my body apart.&quot; Today, he is a commentator on a weekly wrestling TV show. His photo appears on posters the FDA is shipping to the nation's high schools this month. The fierce-looking, hairy-chested Mr. Ventura, a ring dangling from one ear, is shown saying, &quot;Don't pump trouble. Stay away from steroids.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
