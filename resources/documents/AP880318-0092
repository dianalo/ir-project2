Hospital officials said another18 were wounded.   In the occupied West Bank city of Ramallah, two young protesterssuffered bullet wounds in a clash with troops following noon prayerservices, a doctor at Ramallah Hospital said.   One was shot in the abdomen and was in serious condition, whilethe other was shot in the leg.   In all, protests broke out today in a dozen towns and refugeecamps following Moslem noon prayers, repeating a patternestablished during the demonstrations which began Dec. 8.   A prominent Arab attorney was detained in Gaza, promptingprotests from Israeli liberals, and two senior Cabinet ministersurged Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin to impose tougher measuresagainst Palestinian protesters.   Security forces detained two Israelis found with an arsenal ofweapons and suspected of planning anti-Arab attacks, police said.The two were identified as Moshe Vinokor of Rishon Lezion andGershon Luxemburg of Jerusalem, both 44.   In the Gaza Strip, army spokesmen confirmed one Palestinian waskilled in a clash at the Shati refugee camp. Officials at ShifaHospital identified the victim as 24-year-old Hani Abu Hamam.   The fatality brought to 101 the number of Palestinians killed inmore than 14 weeks of unrest in the Israeli-occupied territories,according to U.N. figures.   Shifa officials said they treated 14 other Palestinians woundedby gunfire at Shati. Officials at nearby Ahli Arab Hospital saidthey treated three other gunshot cases from Shati and one from GazaCity.   The army spokesmen said initial reports showed threePalestinians were wounded in Shati, but they were checking hospitalreports of additional woundings.   An Arab reporter said he saw troops in Shati fire tear gas,rubber bullets and live ammunition at hundreds of Palestinians whothrew rocks at soldiers after coming out of the noon prayers atmain Al-Gharbi mosque.   He said an army helicopter also dropped tear gas on the crowd,which had been aroused by morning clashes between troops and youngArabs in the narrow streets of the camp.   The daily Haaretz quoted Transport Minister Chaim Corfu assaying troops should shoot stone-throwers through the heart.   Minister Without Portfolio Yitzhak Modai told the daily Maarivthe disturbances never would have gained strength if soldiers hadfired directly on protesters from the start.   Mohammed Abu Shaban, the vice president of the Gaza BarAssociation, was picked up late Thursday after a Tel Aviv protestgathering. Israeli officials alleged he was involved in subversiveactivities.   Abu Shaban has represented several Gazans in appeals to theIsraeli Supreme Court. Tel Aviv University professors and theleft-wing Citizens' Rights Movement protested the detention anddemanded his release.   Economic boycotts by Palestinians appeared to be having someeffect. Haaretz reported that revenues from a sales and service taxpaid by Palestinians had dropped by 20 percent during the last twomonths.   On Thursday, two masked Palestinians armed with a pistol and aSoviet-designed Kalashnikov assault rifle shot and wounded anIsraeli civilian in the Gaza Strip for the first time since theunrest began.
