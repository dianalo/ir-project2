Leading a team of scientists, they painstakingly identified the gene responsible for cystic fibrosis, the horrible disorder that kills most of its victims before they reach their mid-20s.    Some 30,000 Americans now have the disease, and more than a thousand new cases are diagnosed each year. Now there is hope for them. Finding the mutation of the responsible gene is the first step toward finding a cure. Scientists may be able to splice copies of a normal gene into a virus that could be placed in lung tissue. The healthy genes could then displace a significant number of cells and reverse the defect.    This breakthrough is yet another product of one of the most underappreciated revolutions of modern times, the development of genetic engineering. For decades, vaccines have crudely altered the genetic structure of deadly viruses. But they have been shot-in-the-dark enterprises. Genetic changes weren't understood, some diseases remained impervious.    Molecular biology has changed all that. Now, scientists can arrive at a more precise understanding of genetic change. Bioengineering allows scientists to control some of those changes.    Gene therapy could yield cures to the more than 3,000 identified genetic diseases, including muscular dystrophy, severe combined immune deficiency syndrome (the boy-in-the-bubble disease), PKU, and thalessemia and the anemias, including sickle cell. Last May, Dr. Steven A. Rosenberg of the National Cancer Institute became the first doctor to successfully insert a foreign gene into a human patient. The engineered white blood cells were not expected to cure the patient's cancer but merely to help doctors track treatment. It is an important first step.    But Dr. Rosenberg's efforts raised the ire of that much publicized nonscientist named Jeremy Rifkin. Mr. Rifkin filed suit against the procedure, but managed only to delay it.    Mr. Rifkin and other like-minded media darlings have been fighting gene therapy since the mid-'70s. A graduate of the 1960s anti-science school of progressivism, Mr. Rifkin marched around with &quot;Don't Tread on My Genes&quot; placards and spread hysteria with talk of a black plague emerging from scientific labs. Today, Mr. Rifkin argues that a cure for cystic fibrosis will lead inexorably to a totalitarian Brave New World. He attacks medical advances, saying, &quot;They believe the way to advance knowledge is to get control over the forces of nature. Nature wasn't placed here for us.&quot; He wallows in his cruel abstractions while thousands suffer and die of genetic diseases.    Like most radical groups these days, Mr. Rifkin takes to the courts to block what he dislikes. Fortunately, he has had little impact on medicine but tragically has had some success in stalling agricultural advances by creating periodic scares. The current one is over a genetically engineered hormone made from naturally occurring substances called bovine somatotropin, which increases a cow's milk production by 10% to 25%. But the Rifkin outfit, &quot;Foundation for Economic Trends,&quot; has just claimed that the hormone causes increased breast cancer and &quot;hormonal and allergenic effects&quot; in infants.    Even the highly risk-averse Food and Drug Administration has declared the hormone safe and thrown cold water on the Rifkin report, but, as usual, science has become irrelevant in the face of frightening claims. Five big supermarket chains, including Kroger and Safeway, have done what corporations usually do when struck with a Rifkinesque attack. They have withdrawn milk produced with the aid of somatotropin from their dairy cases.    Retailers no doubt figure it is cheaper to take a short-term loss than to lose customers driven away by a scare. But they may also be emboldening the scare merchants to expand their efforts now that they have a taste of power. Indeed, empty milk shelves is itself a repeat of the phony Alar scare, which resulted in the needless destruction of hundreds of tons of apples treated with the preservative.    We like to think that in this democracy real science will ultimately prevail over phony science. The demanding, painstaking, compassionate work that now offers hope for victims of cystic fibrosis and their families is too valuable to be sacrificed to publicity-seeking boobs. </TEXT></DOC>
