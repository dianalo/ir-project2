The past few global air shows have been deal-a-minuteaffairs, with carriers and leasing concerns jockeying toplace orders for new commercial aircraft. But in 1991, ordershave been as &quot;dry as the Saudi desert,&quot; in the words ofMorgan Stanley andamp; Co. analyst Phil Friedman. The airlines'serious financial woes -- exacerbated by the Persian Gulf Warand the continuing sluggishness in the overall economy --have put most fleet-expansion plans on hold.</LP><TEXT>   Most of the activity at the Paris Air Show, which runsthrough June 23, so far has reflected interest in weaponssales that has been piqued by the war.   The commercial market &quot;is trying to deal with just itssurvival right now,&quot; said Steven Udvar-Hazy, the president ofInternational Lease Finance Corp., a unit of AmericanInternational Group Inc. and a major client of the Big Threejetliner makers: Boeing, McDonnell Douglas Corp. and AirbusIndustrie.   Indeed, during the opening three months of the year, theindustry notched its fewest new orders since the firstquarter of 1985. Airbus and McDonnell Douglas actuallyrecorded net cancellations of aircraft during the period.Even with Boeing's latest announcement, the No. 1 jetmanufacturer has booked orders for only 89 planes so far thisyear, compared with 207 through the same span last year.   Airbus's chief executive, Jean Pierson, told reporters atthe air show yesterday that the European consortium has nowlowered its 1991 order forecast to 145 aircraft. It had beenprojecting 154 bookings before the Gulf War. Either way, thenumber will pale in comparison to the 404 firm orderstotaling $27 billion taken in by Airbus last year.   &quot;This industry has never been able to get supply anddemand in synch,&quot; said Rick Hatton, the president of GATXAir, a unit of Chicago-based GATX Corp. that leases, financesand reconditions planes for commercial carriers. &quot;Everybodyknew things would slow down. What wasn't known is that itwould be so severe.&quot;   Given that most industry experts expect the airlinermarket to rebound eventually and passenger traffic to pickup, the real question is how long the current slump willlast. Mr. Pierson noted that even if Airbus gets no neworders, it still has five years of work ahead of it. Boeing'sbacklog similarly reached record levels in March.   &quot;The airline industry simply can't absorb all the ordersit has placed&quot; during the recent buying boom, said HowardRubel, an aerospace analyst for C.J. Lawrence Inc. who isattending the air show. He noted that in 1989 alone, 1,760new planes were ordered -- enough for three healthy years ofdeliveries. &quot;Now it's the backside of the industry -- theproduction lines -- that has to perform,&quot; he said.   In the meantime, Mr. Rubel added, there are still going tobe &quot;a lot of nervous airplane salesmen&quot; in Paris this week.   Mr. Pierson described as &quot;speculation&quot; reports thatFederal Express Corp. would order 25 Airbus A-300 wide-bodyjets at the air show. A spokesman for McDonnell Douglas'scommercial aircraft unit said he anticipated no new orders toemerge in Paris this year. The company will hold a mediabriefing this weekend, however, where it is expected todiscuss prospects for a new 105-seat, two-engine jet.   The orders announced by Seattle-based Boeing weren'tentirely unexpected. Especially during slow times,manufacturers will often delay news until the air show sothat they have something to trumpet. Specifically, Boeingsaid AMR Corp.'s American Airlines has signed for 11 767-300extended-range airliners and 16 757-200s; Lufthansa orderedseven 737-400s; Delta Air Lines booked two 767-300extended-range jetliners and four 757 twinjets; and GPA GroupLtd. added one 737-300 and converted options for 24 otheraircraft.   Boeing is planning to hold a briefing today, and aspokesman said there is &quot;the possibility of anotherannouncement.&quot; The company has been especially eager to signup additional customers for its new widebody, two-engine 777.</TEXT></DOC>
