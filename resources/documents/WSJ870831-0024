Negotiators for CBS and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers were scheduled to meet in Phoenix, Ariz., to begin discussions on a new contract to replace a three-year agreement that expires Sept. 30.    CBS and the union are expected to wrestle over many of the same issues that promoted the strike at NBC, a unit of General Electric Co., by the National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians, which represents NBC technicians and news employees.    Among other things, NBC is seeking greater freedom to employ part-time workers, while the union wants a four-day workweek. Federal mediators have been supervising the talks. </TEXT></DOC>
