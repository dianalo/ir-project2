Karr   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>09/27/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A6</SO><GV>POSTAL SERVICE (POS)</GV><RE>NORTH AMERICA (NME)UNITED STATES (US)</RE><LP>   WASHINGTON -- The Postal Service expects to trim 47,000more jobs from its work force by late 1995 as it steps upautomated processing, Postmaster General Anthony Frank said.   Mr. Frank said such labor-cost savings would help postponefurther rate increases. He said that if the agency is allowedto put a 30-cent rate into effect for the first ounce offirst-class letters, it hopes to have just one more rateboost -- in 1995 -- by the end of the 1990s.</LP><TEXT>   Last year, the service asked to lift the first-class rateto 30 cents from 25 cents, but the independent Postal RateCommission held the rise to 29 cents. The commission alsowidened the rate increase for third-class mail 25% from the17% the service sought.   The service has asked the commission to reconsider thecase. Postal officials complain that both the smallerfirst-class rise and damped advertising-mail volume caused bythe recession and the large third-class increase have hurtpostal revenue. In addition, Congress has forced the agencyto shoulder $4.9 billion more in postal retiree costs, Mr.Frank said.   If the commission continues to stick by the 29-centfirst-class rate, the Postal Service board of governorscould, on a unanimous vote, put the 30-cent rate into effecton its own.   The 47,000 jobs expected to be trimmed by 1995 would be ontop of 37,000 jobs already eliminated since the agency'srecord employment of 787,000 in May 1989, Mr. Frank said. Headded that he hoped the reductions could continue to be madethrough attrition, without actual layoffs.   Mr. Frank said that letter carriers increasingly will feelthe effects of automation that so far have been experiencedmostly by processing clerks. The agency is moving to extendautomation to final sorting of mail for delivery routes. Hesaid it will take letter carriers substantially less time tosort mail at the post office and give them more time fordelivery.   By the end of 1992, about 61% of all cards and lettershandled by the Postal Service will carry bar codes thatsignify destinations. The agency's goal is to have all cardsand letters bar-coded by 1995, Mr. Frank said. New automatedequipment reads the bar codes and speedily sorts the mail.</TEXT></DOC>
