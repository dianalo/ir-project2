Box 10246, Birmingham, Alabama 35202 has fileda petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.1105 (housing of undergroundtransformer stations, battery-charging stations, substations, compressorstations, shops, and permanent pumps) to its Mary Lee No. 1 Mine (I.D.No. 01-00515) and its Mary Lee No. 2 Mine (I.D. No. 01-00821) both locatedin Walker County, Alabama. The petition is filed under section 101(c) ofthe Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. A summary of the petitioner's statements follows: 1. The petition concerns the requirement that air currents used to ventilatestructures or areas enclosing electrical installations be coursed directlyinto the return. 2. As an alternate method, petitioner proposes to install and maintaina carbon monoxide monitoring system utilizing belt air to ventilate theactive working places as follows: 3. An early warning detection system would be installed. A low-level carbonmonoxide detection system would be installed in all belt entries utilizedas intake aircourses. The low-level CO system would be capable of givingwarning of a fire for four hours should the power fail; a visual alertsignal would be activated when the CO level is 10 ppm above the ambientlevel and an audible signal would sound at 15 ppm above the establishedambient level. All persons would be withdrawn to a safe area at 10 ppmand evacuated at 15 ppm. The CO monitoring system would initiate the firealarm signals at an attended surface location where there is two-way communication.This responsible person would notify the working sections and other personnelwho may be endangered, when the established alert and alarm levels arereached. The CO system would be capable of identifying any activated sensorand for monitoring electrical continuity and deleting electrical malfunctions.4. The CO monitoring system would be visually examined at least once eachcoal producing shift and tested for functional operation weekly to ensurethe monitoring system is functioning properly. The monitoring system wouldbe calibrated with known concentrations of CO and air mixtures at leastmonthly. 5. If at any time the CO monitoring system or any portion of the systemhas been deenergized for reasons such as routine maintenance or failureof a sensor unit, the belt conveyor may continue to operate provided theaffected portion of the belt conveyor entry would be continuously patrolledand monitored for CO by a qualified person using hand-held CO detectingdevices. 6. The details for the fire detection system including, but not limitedto, type of monitor and specific sensor location on the mine map wouldbe included as a part of the Ventilation System and Methane Dust ControlPlan. 7. Petitioner states that the proposed alternate method will provide thesame degree of safety for the miners affected as that afforded by the standard.<ITAG tagnum="84">Request for Comments </ITAG>Persons interested in this petition may furnish written comments.
