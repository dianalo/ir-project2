Under the plan, SCI and its major subsidiary, Scipsco, would be liquidated and their assets transferred to a limited partnership, Storer Communications. SCI said the proposed restructuring is primarily for tax purposes. It added that if the restructuring isn't completed by Dec. 31, it won't take place.    SCI was formed by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. last year to effect its $2.4 billion leveraged buyout of Storer Communications Inc., a television broadcasting and cable concern.    SCI said the restructuring plan calls for it to make a cash payment to holders of its common stock and warrants in order to defray the holders' associated tax expenses. It estimated the payment would be 85 cents a share or warrant.    It also said SCI would pay back $600 million in existing bank debt. It added that Storer Finance Corp., an affiliated concern, would become managing general partner of the new partnership, and would obtain about $800 million in new bank debt.    SCI said the proposal is subject to a number of conditions, including approval by Scipsco's preferred shareholders and holders of certain debt securities of SCI. </TEXT></DOC>
