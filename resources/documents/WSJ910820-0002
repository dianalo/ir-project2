The Soviet Union's dual role as the world's largest oilproducer and as a huge importer of grains creates newuncertainties for U.S. farm policy and raises questions aboutSoviet oil supplies and investment in the U.S.S.R. by Westernoil companies.</LP><TEXT>   U.S. grain prices plummeted because of concern that U.S.farmers would lose their biggest customer for corn andsoybean meal. But prices of crude oil and petroleum productsshot up on fears that the flow of oil and natural gas fromthe Soviet Union, one of the world's largest producers, couldbe disrupted.   Gold, silver and platinum prices initially ran up in Tokyoand European markets but fell back in New York trading. The&quot;safe haven&quot; appeal of precious metals gave way to investorworries that the Soviets would step up sales of gold andplatinum to raise cash if the U.S. and other major industrialcountries decide to withhold economic assistance.   Grain markets were shaken the most because of speculationthat the U.S. would respond to the Soviet developments bywithholding export credit assistance with which the SovietUnion buys U.S. grain.   The fate of the Soviets' $1.5 billion agricultural exportcredit package remained unclear yesterday. The AgricultureDepartment declined to say whether it intends to suspend $900million in unused government-guaranteed credits to Moscow.   The department took a wait-and-see approach pendingfurther guidance from the White House. A department spokesmansaid no announcement regarding Soviet export credits would bemade unless conditions in the Soviet Union changed&quot;drastically.&quot;   That intensified anxiety among farm leaders, exporters andcommodity traders. &quot;It's a bad day for American agriculture,&quot;said Keith Heard, head of the National Corn GrowersAssociation. &quot;They're one of our biggest customers.&quot;   &quot;It looks grim,&quot; said Robert Petersen, president of theNational Grain Trade Council. &quot;We live and die by exports.&quot;   The administration isn't expected to impose a grainembargo on Moscow, however. &quot;The greatest blow to U.S.agriculture was . . . {former President} Carter's embargo&quot; ongrain shipments in response to the Soviet invasion ofAfghanistan, said William Louis-Dreyfus, head of theinternational grain-trading giant Louis Dreyfus Co. &quot;I'mquite confident George Bush won't make such glaring errors asJimmy Carter.&quot;   Daniel Basse, director of market research at AgResourceCo., a Chicago consulting concern, said that if the currentSoviet hardliners remain in power for the next week, odds arefairly good that relations between the U.S. and Soviet Unionwill cool. Export credits could be withdrawn in such a case,he said, because they were put in place to furtherperestroika and the democratic process.   For the past decade, U.S. farm policymakers have sought todevelop an export-oriented agriculture and have counted onstrong Soviet export demand to make it work. The Sovietsbought $16 billion of U.S. grain between 1981 and 1990 andaccounted for 12% of all U.S. wheat exports and 18% of allcorn exports. In 1989, a whopping one-third of the nation'scorn exports went to the Soviets.   But now, Soviet economic and political turmoil is callinginto question the wisdom, as Rep. Dan Glickman (D., Kan.) putit, of putting &quot;so many of our eggs in one basket.&quot;   The consensus long-term view is that the U.S. willcontinue to sell grain to the Soviet Union, if only becauseof the two nations' economic interdependence: The U.S. needsexport markets for its grain and other farm products, whilethe Soviet Union, no matter who is in power, needs imports tofeed its people and avoid internal unrest.   &quot;The Soviets have to continue to eat,&quot; said Joel Jacobson,a corn futures broker. &quot;We are still their most likely foodsource.&quot;   Petroleum prices spiked higher world-wide on news of thecoup. Prices generally eased in later trading but stillclosed more than $1 a barrel higher in most markets, thebiggest move since the Persian Gulf War.   Behind the price run-up was the very real possibility ofchaos in the world's largest oil-producing country. Around90% of Soviet production is in the Russian republic headed bythe liberal Boris Yeltsin and could be subject to sabotage orslowdowns if the workers believe their autonomy isthreatened. If strikes, riots or perhaps even a civil warshould shut down Soviet oil exports, which already have beendeclining, more than two million barrels a day would beremoved from world oil markets.   The prospect of losing any Soviet oil exports will causeoil companies to try to build inventories in advance of thehigh-demand period of fall and winter, some oil economistssaid. &quot;It couldn't come at a worse time for the oil market,&quot;said Lawrence Goldstein, president of Petroleum IndustryResearch Foundation in New York.   The world's demand for crude, which has been sluggish,will still be met. &quot;Soviet exports of crude oil and productsprobably could be made up&quot; by raising North Sea output and bythe Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, at leasttemporarily, said J. Robinson West, president of PetroleumFinance Corp., Washington. But he questioned whether Sovietnatural-gas exports to Europe, equal in volume to petroleumexports on an oil-equivalent basis, could be replaced.   According to Petroleum Finance's estimate of currentcapacity of 25.7 million barrels a day, even OPEC would havea problem making up lost Soviet oil for long. OPEC already isproducing 23.4 million barrels a day with Iraq's exportsbanned.   As a result, many oil analysts expect prices to risefurther in the weeks ahead. &quot;Given an oil market wheresurplus capacity is all but nonexistent, or located in Iraq,expect market tightness and elevated prices over the next sixmonths,&quot; said Michael C. Lynch, a senior research analystwith Washington International Energy Group. Mr. Lynchpredicted a range of $24 to $35 a barrel.   Western oil companies with operations in the Soviet Unionsuggested that the future of major investment there has beenjeopardized. Most major oil companies that have beennegotiating with the Soviets on joint ventures were cautiousin their comments. Amoco Corp. was among those declining tospeculate about its prospects. But it noted that the Sovietpetroleum industry's needs haven't changed. &quot;While no one canpredict the future, we can say that Amoco will activelypursue the oil and gas developments we've been discussingwith the Soviets,&quot; said Patrick J. Early, president of AmocoProduction Co.   Most of the companies looking to work in the oil sector --and there could be as many as 70 of them, according to anunpublished Salomon Brothers study -- have been negotiatingwith local authorities of the various republics. Theoverthrow of the Soviet government could suspend or undo thatwork. The coup presumably was meant to forestall the signingof the Union Treaty that had been scheduled for today. Thatdocument could have changed the status of the republics,granting them control over some of their own resources.   Gold has traditionally risen in price during times ofinternational crisis, but many people are skeptical that goldstill has much of a role left as a haven. Gold fell, ratherthan rose, at the outbreak of the Persian Gulf War inJanuary. Yesterday, when some traders expected a strongupward move, gold ran out of steam early.   Putting pressure on prices were worries that the newSoviet regime will increase sales of precious metals andother commodities to replace any lost foreign credit, dealersand bankers say. The Soviet Union is among the world'slargest producers of gold and platinum.   Adding to the uncertainty about Soviet plans,Vneshekonombank, the Soviet Union's Bank for Foreign Affairsin charge of selling precious metals, didn't deal yesterday,a Swiss bullion manager said.   &quot;Pressure on the Soviet Union's foreign-exchange reserveswill inevitably increase,&quot; said Robert Guy, a director ofN.M. Rothschild andamp; Sons, London bullion bankers.   But one analyst who recently visited Soviet gold minessaid the country may not have as much gold to sell as manypeople think. Lucille Palermo, a gold analyst with moneymanagement firm Van Eck Associates, said that, based on herrecent visit to several Soviet mines, the country is probablyproducing 25% less than the 300 tons a year generallyassumed, partly because of dilapidated equipment. The SovietUnion has a great deal of gold-mining potential, she said,but it needs Western capital to develop its resources.   In commodity trading, grain futures fell the maximumallowed for one day just after the opening bell. Corn forDecember delivery fell its maximum of 10 cents a bushel,recovered somewhat, then fell again to finish &quot;limit down&quot; at$2.40 a bushel.   November soybeans fell their daily limit of 20 cents abushel but ended 18.5 cents lower at $5.405. December wheatinitially plunged the 20 cents-a-bushel limit but ended at$2.9575, down 16.25 cents.   Oil for September delivery opened at $23 a barrel, up$1.70 from Friday's close. But after rising 10 cents more, itdrifted lower to end at $22.47, up $1.17.   December gold jumped $5 an ounce to a high of $368.50 butended just 60 cents above Friday's close at $364.10.September silver gained as much as 10 cents an ounce butfinished only one cent higher than Friday at $4.005. Octoberplatinum rose $12.30 an ounce but ended with a gain of $4.80at $350.90.</TEXT></DOC>
