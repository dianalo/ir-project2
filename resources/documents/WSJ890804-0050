The allegations against the Copiague, N.Y., company were made in a letter from the chairman of a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee investigating generic drug companies to Frank Young, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration. The subcommittee said memos it obtained from an outside lab hired by Bolar to test the drug suggest Bolar substituted SmithKline's product to obtain approval to sell the drug in 1987.    However, Bolar President Robert Shulman denied that the company passed off the brand-name drug as its own in bioequivalance testing. Such testing determines whether the drug is absorbed into the body at the same levels as the pioneer product. &quot;Emphatically, categorically I can say that we didn't use the SmithKline product,&quot; Mr. Shulman asserted.    If the allegations prove true, Bolar would become the second generic drug maker to have tricked the FDA to get approval to sell copies of Dyazide. In June, Vitarine Pharmaceuticals Inc., of Springfield Gardens, N.Y., admitted to the FDA that it submitted Dyazide in Vitarine capsules to gain FDA approval. Vitarine was the subject of a front-page story in Wednesday's Wall Street Journal. Bolar was the first out with a generic Dyazide, and Vitarine was close behind.    Bolar said its version of Dyazide, the blood-pressure medicine, is being analyzed by the Food and Drug Administration. &quot;Bolar is confident that when the FDA's tests are completed, its product will be fully vindicated,&quot; the company said. The follow-up tests were ordered after the subcommittee put pressure on the FDA. Mr. Shulman said Bolar's version of Dyazide is safe and effective and that has been proven through clinical testing. &quot;I insist there is absolutely nothing wrong,&quot; he said.    The news sent Bolar's stock plunging $1.25 a share to $27.75 before trading was halted on the American Stock Exchange yesterday morning. When Bolar received approval to market its Dyazide copy in 1987 the company's stock shot up more than $6 a share in one day.    Bolar and Vitarine were the only two companies to gain generic approval for copies of Dyazide, a competition that significantly hurt SmithKline.    Subcommittee Chairman John D. Dingell (D., Mich.) said Bolar's drug should be recalled unless the FDA had proof from recent inspections at Bolar that the company hadn't switched the SmithKline product for its own. Officials at the FDA couldn't immediately be reached for comment.    Hemant Shah, a generic drug industry analyst in Warren, N.J., estimated that Bolar has between 40% and 50% of the $80 million generic market for the blood-pressure drug. Mr. Shah said if Bolar were involved in a switch, recall costs would amount to about $15 million to $20 million. In addition, he said, Bolar probably also would face litigation from SmithKline, which pioneered Dyazide more than 20 years ago.    At its peak, Dyazide was a $350 million-a-year drug for SmithKline. As a result of generic competition, Mr. Shah estimates that SmithKline's Dyazide sales fell to about $200 million in 1988 and will be about $125 million this year. He estimates that dwindling Dyazide sales cost SmithKline about $90 million in profit in 1988.    Officials at PharmaKinetics Laboratories Inc., which did bioequivalence testing for Bolar, noted on June 23 that the powder inside a Bolar test capsule of its version of Dyazide was darker than powder contained in later batches.    &quot;We detected what appeared to be an irregularity,&quot; said Paul L. Perito, an attorney for the contract laboratory. He said that information was provided to Bolar, which promised to look into the reason for the color change. Mr. Perito stressed that PharmaKinetics doesn't have any information, beyond the color discrepancy, that would show Bolar was involved in a switch.    Bolar's Mr. Shulman said he couldn't offer an explanation for the discrepancy in colors. &quot;The FDA will look at it and determine whether the color is important,&quot; he said.    In an earlier statement, PharmaKinetics said that &quot;no one connected in any way with PharmaKinetics had knowledge whatsoever of the alleged switch of drug substances. PharmaKinetics cannot have been expected to spot the switch in the testing which it did.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
