The group, which will pay $550 million for the stake as part of a plan to help bolster Turner Broadcasting's finances, is made up of 14 cable operators and Kirk Kerkorian, the investor.    The investor plan is a response to concern among cable operators about the future control of Turner Broadcasting. The Atlanta-based broadcaster is an important programming source for the operators, and they want it to remain linked to their operations.    Time has a cable subsidiary, American Television andamp; Communications Corp., that wasn't an original member of the group. A Time spokesman declined further comment.    Turner Broadcasting will use the proceeds from the sale of the 35% interest to redeem 53.3 million preferred shares issued as part of the company's $1.5 billion purchase of MGM/UA Entertainment Co. The preferred is scheduled to begin paying dividends in the form of Turner Broadcasting common stock in June. </TEXT></DOC>
