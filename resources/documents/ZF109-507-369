(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Company officials who are counting their pennies say it is more economical tohire pricey database consultants than salaried, in-house database experts.andM;By Emily KayandM;Although they are somewhat more respected, database consultants occupy asimilar niche in computing as lawyers do in law.andP;  Both groups deal in arcanelanguages and command high fees for their services, but database consultantsactually give you something tangible for your money.andM;With those fees in mind, the first step in using a consultant's services isdetermining what you need and whether you even require one.andM;Assessing your needs.andP;  Many organizations large and small hire databaseconsultants for development work.andP;  The main reason often boils down toeconomics: Despite their fees, it's cheaper to hire a consultant on a projectbasis than to pay the freight for a full-time employee.andM;&quot;It's simple; it's a question of money,&quot; said Robert Verheecke, chieffinancial and information officer with Netframe Systems Inc. of Milpitas,Calif.andP;  &quot;We have a set of needs, but we can't justify the head count.andO;Long-term, we want database capability in-house as part of MIS, but rightnow, we don't have the budget, nor can we justify a full-time person.andP;  Whenwe can afford a full-time person, we'll hire one.&quot;andM;Verheecke used a consultant to build a database that, although relativelysimple, was critical to his business and would serve as a client/server modelfor the entire server manufacturing firm.andM;Stephen Thomas, senior manager of media development with Northern TelecomInc. in Nashville, Tenn., needed to send mailings to 3,000 potentialcustomers in a short period of time and send about 10,000 individual mailingsper year.andM;He and his co-workers also had to track data about the recipients and theircompanies.andM;&quot;The only way we could do that with our staff limitations was to put it allinto one major database and derive everything we did through the database, sothat everyone knew what was going on,&quot; said Thomas.andM;With a staff of only three, he didn't have the time or resources to develop adatabase.andP;  So he hired a database consultant.andM;&quot;By using an outside consultant programmer,&quot; he said, &quot;we were able todevelop a full-blown database using 4th Dimension, continue to enhance it,and we drove the efficiencies and productivity of our group sky-high.&quot;andM;Even huge, resource-rich companies such as San Francisco-based Bechtel Corp.andO;bring in consultants to cut costs.andP;  The Requirements Analysis Group inAutomation Technology at Bechtel pays an hourly rate for a part-timeconsultant who occupies an office, participates in some department meetingsand is on-site five days a week.andP;  But the company does not pay for full-timebenefits nor overhead such as telephone lines and computer gear, said DianaFoster, who heads the group.andM;Fees.andP;  Most consultants charge clients on an hourly basis rather than perproject.andP;  Jim Sheldon-Dean, a management-systems consultant with Lewis CreekSystems of Charlotte, Vt., charges $75 per hour plus expenses for clientswithin driving distance.andP;  Beyond that, his fee is $1,000 per day plusexpenses.andM;Larry Barcot, president of Escape Inc., a consulting firm in Costa Mesa,Calif., commands $115 an hour up to a certain figure.andP;  Barcot, who is alsoexecutive director of the Macintosh Consultants Network, will pay thedifference if the work takes longer or bill less if it takes less time.andM;Rick Kollmeyer, co-owner of The Support Group Inc., an Omnis developer inNewton, Mass., charges hourly fees of $75 to $100, while Bob Duthie,president of Duthie Associates Inc. in Nashville, Tenn., gets $50 to $150 perhour.andM;Verheecke pays by the hour and structures the project with an agreed-on setof deliverables and time frames.andM;&quot;With a fixed fee, either party comes out ahead,&quot; said Verheecke.andP;  &quot;It'sfairer for me to manage the process.andP;  The end result is a fair price for workdone in a reasonable time frame.&quot;andM;Both parties can contribute to problems, which makes an hourly rate best,agreed Margy Moremen, project leader with LDG Management Co., an insuranceintermediary in Woburn, Mass., which is a client of Kollmeyer's.andM;&quot;We'll spend a whole day together and find out that everything we did had tobe trashed because what I decided wasn't the right way to do it,&quot; Moremensaid.andP;  &quot;We also came up with a bug in the way Kollmeyer had done someprogramming that we weren't anticipating.andP;  It's a trade-off; sometimes it'smy fault, and sometimes it's his.&quot;andM;Assessing consultants.andP;  Clients largely rely on referrals, reputation andpersonal contacts to find the right consultants.andM;Several vendors recommended Kollmeyer to Angela Zarrella, systems analystwith Boston-based Transnational Financial Services.andP;  Kollmeyer had abackground in Omnis 3, and Zarrella had already chosen the package.andM;Kollmeyer's ability to explain his work in plain English has been a majorreason for giving him repeat work, said Zarrella.andM;Moremen selected Omnis 5 after hiring Kollmeyer.andM;&quot;We were looking at 4th Dimension, Oracle and others, but we waited on makinga software decision until after we talked to a consultant,&quot; she said.andP;  &quot;Thesoftware is not as important as the programmer.andP;  Pick the programmer firstand they have expertise in one program or another.&quot;andM;If consultants are members of MCN, it is easier for prospective clients toassess their abilities and resources, said Sheldon-Dean.andM;MCN checks a consultant's references, and the support of the group enablessmaller consulting firms such as Sheldon-Dean's to offer expertise they maynot have.andM;Augmenting in-house expertise.andP;  Bringing in database consultants for specificprojects is also a good way to acquire expertise that in-house staffers don'thave.andM;&quot;I do systems analysis, determine needs and coordinate for futureautomation,&quot; said Moremen.andP;  &quot;I can't have expertise in all of that.andP;  Mybackground is in the insurance industry and not programming.andP;  I could getinto it, but I don't have time, and I prefer to stay in the industry area.&quot;andM;Zarrella wanted an interactive system to track all her clients as well as thesales process of Transnational Financial Services, which develops mailingsfor professional associations.andP;  Zarrella had no MIS background, and her firmhad no MIS department and no plans to establish one.andM;&quot;Our company doesn't really focus on the MIS department,&quot; Zarrella said.andO;&quot;We're more into production and getting our mail out.&quot;andM;Company employees with database-programming knowledge often don't have thetime to dedicate to one project, noted Barcot.andM;&quot;Those that do have the staff need to do 500 jobs but have enough personnelto do five of them,&quot; he said.andM;The complexity of a product may be too great for the staff of a smallorganization to pick up quickly, and large companies are already stretchingtheir internal resources, according to Kollmeyer.andP;  &quot;They want an expert toprovide a finished solution and not drain their MIS staff,&quot; he said.andM;But getting the expertise doesn't necessarily mean having a consultant on thepremises even part-time or on call.andP;  Although some, such as NorthernTelecom's Thomas, want someone local who can be on site within 15 minutes,Kollmeyer said he believes that electronic communications allow consultantsto be located anywhere.andM;&quot;Even with local people, I rarely see them once a project is under way,&quot; saidKollmeyer.andP;  &quot;For maintenance, they can call or fax.andP;  Sometimes we don't eventalk.andP;  It's all done electronically.&quot;andM;Even if you can find the best consultant at the right price, there aredrawbacks to hiring outside talent.andP;  Having to rely on someone else to keepthe database up and running can be a problem, but managers know that from theoutset.andM;Netframe Systems' Robert Verheecke brushed aside the risk of relying on oneperson as the source of his database.andM;&quot;Sure it's a risk if [our consultant] gets hit by a truck.andP;  We're a smallcompany and growing fast and trying to manage our business to make it asprofitable as quickly as possible,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Those are the risks you facein virtually every opportunity.&quot;andM;To minimize such concerns, most consultants work with and train their clientsas they go along.andM;The consultant who developed a database for Northern Telecom's Stephen Thomasworked closely with the staff, fine-tuning the database as he went along.andO;The consultant continues to enhance it as the staff determines needs.andM;Verheecke said he hopes eventually to hire a full-time database professionalbecause he wants to have the skills internally to ensure that the companyowns the database and can keep it dynamic and growing.andM;Until then, Netframe's consultant will continue to maintain and upgrade thesystem with full input from Verheecke's staff.andM;&quot;He meets with users, designs the structure, presents mock-ups, gets feedbackand implements [the system],&quot; Verheecke said.andP;  &quot;If it's not meeting ourneeds, he modifies it.andP;  It's a living thing, and he keeps checking withpeople.&quot; -- By Emily KayandM;ACIUS INC.andM;4th Dimension: $795; Solutions Directory (list of 4D developers, products andservices): $25andM;10351 Bubb Road, Cupertino, Calif.andP;
