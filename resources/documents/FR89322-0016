Background</ITAG>On August 16, 1982, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approvedthe Ohio program. Information on the general background of the Ohio programsubmission, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments,and a detailed explanation of the conditions of approval of the Ohio program,can be found in the August 10, 1982 <T4>Federal Register </T4>(47 FR 34688). Subsequent actions concerningthe conditions of approval and program amendments are identified at 30CFR 935.11, 935.12, 935.15, and 935.16.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Discussion of the Proposed Amendments</ITAG>By letter dated November 3, 1988 (Administrative Record No. OH-1113), theDirector of OSMRE notified the Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Divisionof Reclamation (Ohio) of a number of Federal regulations promulgated betweenOctober 1, 1983 and June 15, 1988 for which OSMRE had determined that thecorresponding Ohio rules were now less effective than the new Federal counterparts.Also, on December 22, 1988, the Director of OSMRE announced the approval,with certain exceptions, of Ohio Program Amendment No. 34 (53 FR 51543).In this announcement, the Director disapproved the definition of ``propertyto be mined'' at OAC 1501:13-1-02 (MMMM) as submitted by Ohio on May 24,1988. The Director required that Ohio submit a proposed amendment to revisethe definition of ``property to be mined'' so as to require that permitapplications identify all owners of record of mineral estates to be removedor displaced by surface excavation activities during the proposed coalmining operations.In response to the OSMRE requirements of November 3 and December 22, 1988,Ohio submitted proposed Program Amendment No. 39 by letter dated March1, 1989 (Administrative Record No. OH-1168). Proposed Program AmendmentNo. 39 would revise the Ohio program at Ohio Administrative Code (OAC)sections 1501:13-1-02, 13-1-03, 13-4-14, 13-5-01, 13-7-04, 13-7-05, and13-9-11 and would create a new rule at 1501:13-14-06. Nonsubstantive changes are proposed throughout these rules to correct paragraphletter notations, to refer to OSMRE using the full name of the Office ofSurface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, and to correct typographicerrors. The substantive changes in these rules are discussed briefly below: (1) OAC section 1501:13-1-02 paragraph (S)(1): This paragraph is beingrewritten to clarify those activities included under the definition ofthe term ``coal mining operation.'' As proposed, the definition would include``in situ distillation or retorting; leaching or other chemical or physicalprocessing; and the cleaning, concentrating, or other processing or preparationof coal'' and would also include ``the loading of coal at or near the minesite.'' (2) OAC section 1501:13-1-02 paragraph (HHHH): This paragraph is beingrewritten to define ``previously mined area'' as ``land previously minedon which there were no surface coal mining operations subject to the standardsof the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (30 U.S.C. 1201<T3>et seq.</T3>).'' (3) OAC section 1501:13-1-02 paragraph (MMMM): This paragraph is beingrewritten to delete the phrase ``to be mined'' from the definition of ``propertyto be mined.'' The revised definition would read ``the surface estatesand mineral estates within the permit area and the area covered by undergroundworkings.''

(8) OAC section 1501:13-4-14 paragraph (M)(2)(d): This paragraph is beingmoved and revised from paragraph (M)(2)(e)(v). The new paragraph wouldrequire that subsidence control plans include ``a description of monitoring,if any, needed to determine the commencement and degree of subsidence sothat, when appropriate, other measures can be taken to prevent, reduce,or correct material damage in accordance with paragraph (D) of rule 1501:13-12-03the Administrative Code.''
