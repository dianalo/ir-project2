Theselesions are most obvious in the periventricular white matter and appearas punctate or confluent hyperintense abnormalities on T2-weighted images.Their correlation with increasing age and the ensuing increase of cardiovascularrisk factors suggests ischemic damage as their probable underlying pathologiccause. MRI thus may prove an early and very sensitive indicator of incipientcerebrovascular disease, adding information on the association of vasculardamage with the development of dementing illness. This report is a preliminarycommunication of an ongoing study which is evaluating the importanceof these findings in the 'normal' aging brain and different forms ofdementia. 11 refs.; 1 table.
