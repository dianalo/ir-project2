PerryStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal{This is the fourth in a series of personal profiles of1988 presidential candidates.}</HL><DD> 09/25/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> CONGRESS (CNG) </IN><DATELINE> RUSSELL, Kan.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Nearly forty years ago, John Woelk recruited Robert Dole, a young war hero, to run as a Republican candidate for the state Legislature.    &quot;I didn't know back then whether he was a liberal or a conservative,&quot; said Mr. Woelk, a lawyer here and a former county attorney. &quot;I still don't know, and I don't think he knows either. It depends whether the wind's blowing from the north or the south.&quot;    Mr. Dole is running for president, still the war hero from little Russell. But now, after 26 years as a congressman and senator, he is also the ultimate Washington insider and a man with no carefully fixed political philosophy.    He seems, sometimes, to have a chip on his shoulder. He doesn't care for people who grew up with inherited wealth (Vice President George Bush, for example) or people with theories who write books (Jack Kemp, especially).    His idea of relaxation, said his old friend and campaign manager, Robert Ellsworth, &quot;is to sit around and talk political strategy.&quot;    &quot;My father,&quot; said Robin Dole, a Washington lobbyist, &quot;actually loves being on the road, campaigning 12 hours a day.&quot;    All of his close friends are political junkies -- people such as Robert Strauss, former Democratic Party chairman, political lobbyists William Timmons and Tom Korologos, pollster and political strategist Tully Plesser. The best friend he ever had, Kansas newspaperman and longtime GOP national committeeman McDill &quot;Huck&quot; Boyd, died earlier this year. &quot;They both loved politics -- and each other,&quot; said campaign manager Ellsworth.    The 64-year-old senator exercises on a stationary bicycle, positioned in front of the TV set in his apartment in Washington's Watergate complex. He pedals furiously while watching the evening news during the week, then pedals some more while catching all the political talk shows on Sunday (as long, he said, &quot;as my wife doesn't drag me off to church.&quot;)    This is not, then, the Grand Old Party's candidate of new -- or even old -- ideas. This is a tough, skillful, self-made and ferociously ambitious politician who almost died from his terrible World War II wounds.    He is a bewildering set of contradictions: angry and funny, successful and insecure, talkative -- the party's best orator -- and reticent, a Tartar to work for and also a man with genuine compassion for the underdog.    It all comes together on the floor and in the cloakrooms of the Senate, where, as Republican leader, he has become a master legislative strategist. He'll play off a liberal such as GOP Sen. Mark Hatfield of Oregon, one day, then turn his attention to the needs of a conservative -- Sen. Jesse Helms (R., N.C.) has received a lot of favors from Bob Dole -- the next. He knows how to win his battles, one at a time.    If he has no carefully fixed philosophy, he does have some basic instincts. Because of his own handicap, a war-injured arm, he instinctively reaches out to the disadvantaged. He has established a foundation to help the physically handicapped and led the floor fight to make Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday a national holiday.    He said his candidacy will appeal to &quot;a lot of people in our society who feel they have been left out -- whether they are disabled or poor or black or white. I can sit down with a welfare recipient and not be embarrassed about it.&quot;    He is not always receptive to new ideas, and one old notion he cherishes is that the budget should be balanced. He expresses contempt for supply-side economists who are not so concerned about balanced budgets. &quot;I tell them to get back into the real world,&quot; he said.    But it is &quot;character,&quot; that overworked buzz word for the 1988 general election, that Sen. Dole and his key advisers believe will decide the outcome. &quot;There's no war, no major economic disorder,&quot; said Mr. Ellsworth. &quot;This time the issue is character, strength, integrity.&quot;    His character was formed here in Russell and on a battleground in Italy. Bob Dole's roots run deep in central Kansas. Unlike, say, Gary Hart, from Ottawa, Kan.; Walter Mondale, from Elmore, Minn.; or even Ronald Reagan, from Dixon, Ill., he didn't run away from his small-town past. He keeps coming back to Russell, to savor, if nothing else, Aunt Gladys's celebrated potato salad, but without the onions.    The Bob Dole story is so small-town America, so improbable, no self-respecting Hollywood producer would buy it. When he was in high school, Bob Dole actually was a soda jerk, wearing white ice cream pants, in Dawson's drugstore, on Main Street. As an end on the football team, with seconds to go, he caught a pass in the end zone to win the game, 6-0, in the mud against Ellis. &quot;I didn't catch it,&quot; said Mr. Dole. &quot;It stuck to my jersey.&quot;    His father, Doran, ran a cream-and-egg station down by the Union Pacific tracks. Farmers would bring produce to the station; Doran would buy it and see it got to market. Later, he operated the grain elevator. Mr. Dole's mother, Bina, dominated -- domineered maybe, too -- the family. She whipped the kids when they misbehaved. She taught them, the rest of the family recalls, that &quot;can't&quot; is not a part of the language.    Bob Dole, a kid from the prairie, enlisted in the Army and was ordered, with typical Army logic, into battle in Italy with the elite 85th Mountain Infantry, officered by Ivy Leaguers who learned about mountains on New England ski slopes.    On April 14, 1945, Second Lt. Dole, in making what his citation calls &quot;a sweeping flank movement,&quot; walked into mine fields and sniper, machine-gun and small-arms fire. All the men under his command were wounded. Lt. Dole pushed forward until he was wounded himself. He still doesn't know exactly what hit him.    It took 39 months in hospitals to put Bob Dole back together. He almost died two or three times. &quot;When I lost my kidney, even I thought I might lose it all,&quot; he said. &quot;I had a very, very high temperature. It got up to 108.7 degrees. They packed me in ice.&quot;    He went to war a trim 190-pound athlete. He came home to Russell weighing 120 pounds, never again to have functional use of his right arm. &quot;It got to me,&quot; he said. &quot;Why me, and what did I do to deserve this?&quot;    &quot;It still takes Bob two hours to get dressed,&quot; said his brother, Kenny, who is in what's left of the oil business here. &quot;Just imagine trying to tie your tie with one hand with those starched shirts he wears. But he won't give in. He doesn't ask for help, that guy.&quot;    But one person who did help him was Phyllis Holden, an occupational therapist he met in the hospital. They were married three months later. The marriage ended years afterward when Mr. Dole announced he wanted out. &quot;We didn't have any discussion about it,&quot; Mrs. Buzick (she remarried after the divorce) said. &quot;Of course, I was angry, but vindictiveness never got anybody anywhere.&quot;    She supports her ex-husband for president, to the point of making and selling Dole-for-President pins and earrings. &quot;I guess one reason I'm for him,&quot; she said, &quot;is that he works so hard. I'm living proof of that.&quot;    Sen. Dole's second wife, Elizabeth -- he hastens to point out he didn't know her at the time of his divorce -- has resigned as transportation secretary in President Reagan's cabinet, effective Oct. 1, to help the senator campaign.    Mr. Dole's parents were Democrats, and Mr. Dole himself isn't sure just where he stood politically when he came home from the war. His only political hero at the time, he said, was Franklin D. Roosevelt. He was recruited by the Republicans because, as a war hero, he appeared to be a winner.    &quot;It was just sort of a game then,&quot; said Mr. Dole. &quot;You had to be Republican or Democrat, and you ran, and you didn't get into any philosophical discussions.&quot; He said it wasn't until 1960, when he first ran for Congress, that &quot;I even started focusing on what the federal government did and what it could do.&quot;    He's trying now to catch up a little on the theoretical side of politics, reading several books recommended to him by Daniel Boorstin, former librarian of Congress. But, pressed to name these books, he replied, &quot;Oh, you know, the one on Washington, one on Jefferson.&quot; But he can't remember who wrote them. &quot;I don't read a lot of books,&quot; he said, finally. &quot;I don't write many either. I haven't read any of Kemp's.&quot;    Sen. Dole is still trying to live down an image of being mean and ruthless, much of it stemming from his brutal performance as President Ford's running mate against Jimmy Carter and Walter Mondale in 1976 and a mean-spirited campaign for re-election to the Senate two years earlier. &quot;He is competitive,&quot; noted Mr. Ellsworth.    Where does all this drive and aggression come from? Some people think it goes back to those war wounds. His brother, Kenny, recalled Mr. Dole saying the war took almost a decade out of his life and, one way or another, he was going to get it back. But Kenny also said that brother Bob &quot;was a workaholic from the day he was born.&quot;    &quot;It wasn't the wounds that made him the way he is,&quot; said Mr. Ellsworth. &quot;It comes from his genes and his early environment. You know, nurture and nature.&quot;    And now, as his political fortunes improve, this skillful, nonideological political junkie is being asked to define his &quot;vision,&quot; the second major buzz word, slightly trailing &quot;character,&quot; in the 1988 campaign.    &quot;Just the other day,&quot; said Mr. Dole, rarely able to resist a quip, &quot;I had some young lady tell me she was waiting to hear my vision. I said, 'Well, as soon as it comes, I will give you a ring.'&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
