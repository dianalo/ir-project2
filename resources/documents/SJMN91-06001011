Here are songs the kids can sing, stories theycan be interested in and picking that knows no peer. Watson warbling &quot;FroggyWent a-Courtin' &quot; is a joy at any age, giving Watson fans without kids a goodreason to pick up a copy.;    When it comes to titles and covers Floyd Dominohas the situation licked.;    Domino, formerly of Asleep at the Wheel and nowa popular session player, first got into the children's-album market with&quot;Baby Road,&quot; a collection of soothing Beatles tunes played by a piano-basedacoustic band. The cover as much as anything struck a chord with parents --four diaper-clad toddlers walking across the road in a mock tribute to theBeatles' &quot;Abbey Road.&quot; He followed with &quot;The White Album&quot; (the cover showed awhite diaper on a white background) -- more Beatle tunes, but half-vocal andhalf-instrumental, aimed at slightly older kids.;    Domino's latest album is&quot;The Four Tots&quot; and is (you guessed it) a collection of Motown classicsrecorded for the pre-school set. Hearing vocalists Maryann Price (formerly ofDan Hicks and his Hot Licks) and Chris O'Connell (formerly of Asleep at theWheel) croon Motown tunes like &quot;Baby Love&quot; gives them a whole new meaning.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  WAYNE BLEDSOE, Scripps Howard News Service  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910101  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  3C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  308  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday January 1, 199100001011,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
