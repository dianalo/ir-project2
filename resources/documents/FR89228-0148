Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, andStatutory Basis for the Proposed Rule Change </ITAG>In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization includedstatements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change.The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified inItem IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries,set forth in sections (A), (B) and (C) below, of the most significant aspectsof such statements. (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and StatutoryBasis for the Proposed Rule Change The Exchange is proposing to require that its members and persons associatedwith members submit testimony, documentary evidence or other informationin the course of Exchange investigations and inquiries within a time periodrequired by the Exchange. Late submission would be subject to formal disciplinaryaction. The amendment would improve the Exchange's ability to investigate violationswithin its disciplinary jurisdiction and promptly dispose of pending matters.Investigations concerning insider trading and front running would be particularlyenhanced by timely submissions of information by member firms. Additionally, the Exchange is proposing to require its members and memberorganizations to submit customer and proprietary trading data as requestedby the Exchange in the course of its investigations and inquiries\2\<NOTE/> in the universal automated format that was developed by theIntermarket Surveillance Group at the request of the Commission. Submissionsof trading data not received in the required format would also be subjectto formal disciplinary action. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Data requested in connection with market surveillanceinquiries is commonly referred to as ``blue sheet information''. This termis derived from the blue SEC form, which was used by broker-dealers torespond to SEC requests for trading data prior to the widespread use ofcomputers. The Exchange anticipates that implementation of the automated format willsignificantly enhance its regulatory and surveillance capabilities. Thecomputerized format will enable surveillance analysts to sort the dataalphabetically, geographically, chronologically, by size, by price, orin any other manner desired. Information from several members could alsobe analyzed simultaneously to uncover violative conduct occurring amongstfirms. This requirement should not impose a significant additional regulatoryburden on members. Submission of the trading data in the automated formatmay expedite member firm responses to information requests since they willno longer need to produce potentially voluminous ``hard copy'' records.While some firms may have to make initial changes to comply with the rule,ultimately they will be able to make a more cost-effective use of theirresources by eliminating an otherwise time-consuming, labor-intensive task.In addition, since most member organizations have developed these automatedcapabilities in order to comply with similar rules already in place atthe NYSE and the AMEX, compliance with the PSE requirement would not bean additional burden. However, in recognition of the burden that may beimposed on smaller member organizations, paragraph (D) of Commentary .01of the proposed rule change authorizes the Exchange to grant exceptionson a case-by-case basis to the automated reporting requirement, where appropriate.The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6 of the Securitiesand Exchange Act of 1934 (``the Act'') and, in particular, furthers theobjectives of section 6(b)1 as it strengthens the Exchange's ability toenforce compliance by its members and persons associated with its memberswith the provisions of the Act, the rules and regulations thereunder, andthe rules of the Exchange. The proposed rule change is consistent withsection 6(b)5 in that it will improve the Exchange's regulatory and surveillancecapabilities, enabling it to provide increased investor protection, assistin the prevention of fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, andpromote just and equitable principles of trade. (B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change imposes a burdenon competition. (C) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the ProposedRule Change Received from Members, Participants or Others. Written comments on the proposed rule change were neither solicited notreceived. <ITAG tagnum="85">III. Data of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timingfor Commission Action</ITAG>The Exchange has requested accelerated effectiveness of this proposed rulechange pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act. In this regard, the Commissionfinds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtiethday after the date of publication of the proposal in the Federal Register.Part of the proposed rule change is virtually identical to proposals, approvedby the Commission, that were submitted by the Amex, NYSE and CBOE thatrequire member firms to submit certain customer and proprietary tradinginformation in our automated format.\3\<NOTE/> The other part of the proposed rule subjects members andmember organizations to disciplinary action if they do not provide datain a timely manner in response to an Exchange investigation. Parties notcomplying with an Exchange request for material will be entitled to thesame safeguards provided in any Exchange disciplinary hearing.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ <T3>See </T3>Securities Exchange Act Release No. 25859 (June 27, 1988),53 FR 25029, approving Files Nos. SR-Amex-88-04 and SR-NYSE-87-23 and SecuritiesExchange Act Release No. 25235 (November 1, 1988), 53 FR 44688, approvingFile No. SR-CBOE-18.The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with therequirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicableto a national securities exchange and, in particular, the requirementsof section 6 and the rules and regulations thereunder.\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ 15 U.S.C. 78F (1982).The Commission believes that timely responses by members to Exchange investigativerequests will assist the Exchange in expeditiously investigating and disposingof matters within its jurisdiction. The ability of the Exchange to subjectmembers, who do not provide such requested material, to disciplinary procedureswill assist the Exchange in effectively fulfilling its self-regulatoryresponsibilities.The Commission believes that adoption of the universal automated formatfor bluesheet information under the proposed rule will improve significantlythe ability of PSE's regulatory and surveillance staff to conduct theirmarket surveillance and monitoring responsibilities under section 6(b)(1),6(b)(2) and other provisions of the Act. Receipt of market surveillanceinformation in an automated format will permit the Exchange's surveillancestaff to review and analyze the data more rapidly and effectively by enablingthem to directly enter the data into the Exchange's own computer systemfor analysis. Additionally, in instances where the Exchange refers mattersto the Commission for further action, availability of the pertinent bluesheetinformation in an automated format also will facilitate the Commission'sability to analyze and evaluate relevant trading and market surveillancedata. Finally, the Commission believes that adoption of the automated formatwill make it easier for member firms complying with the proposal rulesto gather and submit information in response to requests from the Exchangesin a timely manner and will thus reduce the regulatory burden on thosefirms.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV.
