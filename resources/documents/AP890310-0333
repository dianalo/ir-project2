Grain futures finished mixed on the Chicago Board of Trade. Onother markets, silver futures gained while gold retreated; livestockand meat futures advanced; and energy futures were mixed.   Soybean futures settled 5 cents to 11 cents lower with thecontract for delivery in March at $7.57 a bushel. Wheat was \ centto 3{ cents higher with March at $4.36 a bushel; corn was } cent to2\ cents lower with March at $2.75{ a bushel; oats were { cent lowerto } cent higher with March at $2.07 a bushel.   Soybeans rallied at midday following wire-service reports of anuclear reactor breakdown near Frankfurt, West Germany.   Traders, recalling the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident,frantically bought futures contracts on fears of European cropcontamination. At one point in the session, the most active soybeancontract, for May delivery, was up more than 12 cents fromThursday's close.   But buyers turned sellers on follow-up reports that no radiationhad leaked from the reactor. Two out of four emergency coolingsystems at the Biblis nuclear power plant problems temporarily brokedown, the Hesse state government said.   Selling accelerated shortly thereafter on news of a volcanoeruption in Guatemala. The Pacayo volcano, which last erupted inJune 1987, was reported to be spewing lava, ash and sand, forcingthe evacuation of 255 people.   Analysts said the market's reaction was partly based on a findingpublished four years ago by Paul Handler, a University of Illinoisphysics professor, that volcanic eruptions near the equatortypically are followed by good growing weather in the United States.   Handler had spoken on the subject last week at a crop-weathersymposium in Chicago. He said in a telephone conversation Fridaythat it was too soon to tell whether the eruption in Guatemala mighthave some impact on this summer's weather.   Handler said volcanic eruptions can send certain gases into thestratosphere, where they oxidize into sulfuric acid and water, thencondense into a sunlight-reflecting fog that can stay there for ayear or longer.   ``One hundred and twenty years of data show that when you have alow-latitude volcanic eruption, you have good growing weather in theU.S. corn belt,'' Handler said.   Silver futures built strongly on Thursday's gains on the NewYork's Commodity Exchange, pushing the price for spot delivery wellabove the psychologically important $6-a-troy-ounce level breachedin the previous session.   Analysts said Friday's national unemployment report, showing a0.3 percentage point drop in unemployment last month, ignited newinflation fears and brought more dollars into the silver market as ahedge against rising prices.   But gold futures retreated, displaying once again the reluctanceto rally that is turning some investors against gold as an inflationhedge.   Gold settled 20 cents to 90 cents lower with April at $396.50 atroy ounce; silver was 6 cents to 7.4 cents higher with May at $6.15an ounce and the spot March contract at $6.068 an ounce.   Strong cash markets boosted live cattle futures on the ChicagoMercantile Exchange, which spurred buying in the adjacent pits.   Live cattle settled .30 cent to 1 cent higher with April at 78.05cents a pound; feeder cattle were .03 cent lower to .38 cent higherwith March at 81.25 cents a pound; live hogs were .07 cent lower to.40 cent higher with April at 43.65 cents a pound; frozen porkbellies were .08 cent lower to .60 cent higher with March at 38.45cents a pound.   In choppy trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, West TexasIntermediate crude oil settled 5 cents lower to 1 cent higher withApril at $18.50 a barrel; heating oil was .61 cent to .81 cent lowerwith April at 51.19 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .18 centto .45 cent higher with April at 51.78 cents a pound.</TEXT></DOC>
