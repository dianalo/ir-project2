These sources said the result could be easier Chinese access to Western electronics, machine tools, computers and telecommunications equipment. China already enjoys easier access to such equipment than does the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies.    The meetings were held by the 16-nation Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls, or Cocom, which includes Japan and all members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization except Iceland. Cocom reaches informal agreements that regulate exports to all Communist countries.    In recent months, China has indicated a growing interest in buying Western technology, which has increased pressure for an easing in the export regulations. One concern expressed at the meetings, however, was that China must provide strong assurances that any sensitive equipment it acquires won't end up in the Soviet Union or other Eastern European countries.    In keeping with a broad move to reduce restrictions while improving policing of exports, Cocom last week approved proposals for sales of Boeing Co. 767 aircraft to Poland and Romania. Earlier it had approved plans for the sale of competing Airbus Industrie planes to East Germany. The sales carry provisions to prevent technology from being diverted to military use. </TEXT></DOC>
