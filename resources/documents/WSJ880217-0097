Allen E. Murray, chairman of the nation's second-largest oil company, said that capital expenditures will increase this year, after holding steady for two years, and that Mobil will consider making acquisitions if opportunities arise.    In a wide-ranging interview, Mr. Murray also said Mobil hasn't yet decided whether to sell Montgomery Ward, though he said the company's main focus in the years ahead will be its &quot;core&quot; businesses of oil, natural gas and chemicals. He also disclosed that Mobil has had &quot;general discussions&quot; with representatives of Saudi Arabia regarding the kingdom's interest in investing in refineries abroad.    Mr. Murray also said he expects higher combined sales volumes of oil and gas this year, as well as an improvement in depressed refining margins and continuing strong results from chemical operations. But the chief influence on Mobil's profit -- and the most uncertain -- will be the price of oil.    &quot;The crude price element so dominates everything that a couple dollars a barrel can swing earnings dramatically,&quot; he said.    But Mr. Murray's main message involved an era of &quot;new financial flexibility&quot; at Mobil, whose debt surged with the 1984 acquisition of Superior Oil Co. Cutting that debt has been a major goal of Mr. Murray, who was named chairman two years ago.    Current debt totals $8.7 billion, down from $13.1 billion three years ago. In the same period, debt as a percentage of equity has dropped to 34% from 49%. &quot;We never were worried about our debt-equity ratio,&quot; Mr. Murray said, &quot;but it's more comfortable down at a level where, if opportunities come along, we can take them -- or increase our spending in our core business if we want.&quot;    To that end, he said, &quot;we can afford to increase our capital spending somewhat over the $3 billion level we've been at for the past two years,&quot; he said. &quot;We don't expect to go up in huge jumps, but we do have excellent opportunities and are planning some increases -- maybe (to) $3.5 billion in 1988.&quot; He said funds generated internally can support the increases.    Asked whether Mobil would consider another Superior-size acquisition, Mr. Murray replied: &quot;We don't have any acquisitions on the shelf at the moment. I haven't noticed many bargains out there.&quot; But Mobil recently bought an ethylene plant. And Mr. Murray said the company, with or without a Ward sale, is in a situation in which it could consider additional acquisitions in oil, gas or chemicals.    Montgomery Ward, the major non-oil unit acquired in Mobil's diversification spree more than a decade ago, has a book value of $1.5 billion. Mobil's goal of turning the subsidiary around has been accomplished, Mr. Murray said. Ward earned a record $130 million last year, compared with $106 million in 1986. Oil analysts speculate that Mobil might sell it for $2 billion.    Mobil has received several &quot;unsolicited expressions of interest&quot; in Ward and is &quot;completely open-minded&quot; about the possible sale of the retailer, Mr. Murray said. &quot;But nobody has made an offer that I could take to the bank,&quot; he said.    If Ward isn't sold, &quot;I'm satisfied that it will operate successfully (and) will no longer be a drain on Mobil,&quot; Mr. Murray said. &quot;In fact, in the long term, it will be a cash contributor.&quot;    Some on Wall Street previously viewed as negatives Mobil's debt, its ownership of Ward and its emphasis on refining and marketing and on natural gas. But these now are &quot;actually positives or neutral factors,&quot; said Michael L. Mayer, a former Mobil official who is now vice president, research, at Wertheim Schroder andamp; Co. Also, he said, Mobil's oil-finding costs are competitive, and it has gained market share in the oil industry.    Mobil had 1987 net income of $1.26 billion, or $3.08 a share, on revenue of $56.4 billion. Analysts look for higher earnings in 1988-generally around $3.50 a share. Mr. Murray wouldn't comment on the earnings projections because of the uncertain oil-price outlook. Though he said much depends on OPEC, he speculated that oil prices could remain near today's level -- &quot;give or take a dollar a barrel&quot; -- through June, rising some in the second half. </TEXT></DOC>
