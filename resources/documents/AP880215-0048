STEICHEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Chancellor Helmut Kohl travels toWashington on Wednesday for talks with U.S. officials that areexpected to focus on differences between the two countries onseveral key security issues.   During the three-day visit, Kohl is slated to meet withPresident Reagan, Secretary of State George P. Shultz and leadingmembers of Congress.   Kohl is expected to urge swift Senate ratification of thesuperpower agreement eliminating land-based intermediate-rangenuclear missiles.   Differences between the two nations center on modernizing NATO'sshort-range nuclear weapons and eliminating chemical weapons.   U.S. officials and other NATO countries have emphasized the needfor modernizing short-range nuclear missiles that will remain inEurope after intermediate-range nuclear missiles are scrapped.   But West German officials have said that upgrading ofshort-range weapons systems should be linked to negotiations onreducing the Warsaw Pact's superiority in conventional weapons inCentral Europe.   Short-range, or battlefield, nuclear weapons are primarily aimedat targets on West German and East German territory.   Kohl recently warned U.S. military planners against strategiesthat would limit a nuclear war to German soil.   ``A strategy aimed at limiting the deterrent of nuclear weaponsto Europe, or worse, to German soil is not acceptable to us,'' hetold a meeting of military experts Feb. 6.   Kohl has urged that a higher priority be given to reducing thenumber of short-range missiles, which have a range of less than 300miles.   The superpowers, however, have indicated that future armscontrol talks will first concentrate on reducing strategic, orlong-range, nuclear weapons arsenals.   West German government sources said Sunday that the mainsticking point in Kohl's talks with U.S. officials could be theissue of chemical weapons.   Kohl and Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, who willaccompany the chancellor, are expected to press Reagan anew to worktoward a superpower agreement for the worldwide destruction ofchemical weapons.   U.S. officials have said in recent months that such an agreementmay be difficult to reach because of problems of verification.   West German leaders reject that argument, saying theintermediate-range missile accord proves such problems can beworked out.   Kohl may also seek assurances that Washington will make good ona pledge not to deploy a new generation of binary chemical weaponsin West Germany, government sources said.   Under an agreement reached between Kohl and Reagan during theeconomic summit in Tokyo in 1986, aging chemical weapons nowstationed in West Germany would not be replaced.   Instead, the old weapons would be removed from West Germany andthe new systems held in readiness in the United States.   There are indications, however, that the agreement may not be asfirm as West German officials had hoped.   The news magazine Der Spiegel, in its latest edition, quotedU.S. Geneva arms negotiator Max Friedersdorf as saying theagreement might not extend beyond Reagan's term in office.   U.S. Gen. John Galvin, NATO's chief commander in Europe, told aWest German newspaper on Saturday that he favored stationing thenew weapons in Europe ``where the troops are.''</TEXT></DOC>
