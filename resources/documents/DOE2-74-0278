It explains how the GSP process (Gas plant Schwarze Pumpe) differsfrom conventional systems, namely by using a single pneumatic feed andmetering system, and presents the advantages of the GSP method - feedstockflexibility, less wear in feed pipes, no moving parts, less carrier gas,etc. Traces the development history of the process, whose start-up datewas December 1983. Describes the use of flame and temperature sensors,pressure-reactor periscope, etc. Presents the operating specificationsof the experimental installations and sets forth the objectives of thetest programme (reaction kinetics, ash viscosity, temperature and flamemonitoring, gasification behaviour of pulverised lignite, coke and anthracite,and power-station carbon-rich fly ash, testing of special equipment,etc.). By June 1986 over 100,000 tonnes of pulverised fuel had been consumed.Assesses the cost efficiency and environmental compatibility of the systemand lists its advantages (from cold to full efficiency in 2 hours, performancerange 45 to 110% of rated output, high flexibility, high safety factor,highly automated, suitable for almost any grade of coal, etc.). 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
