WAKIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   In a surprise move, Iraq said Sunday it is halting gasolinerationing imposed earlier in response to global economic sanctions.The Soviets said their latest diplomatic effort to settle thePersian Gulf crisis has apparently failed.   The cancellation of the gasoline rationing was reported by theofficial Iraqi News Agency, which also said the oil minister hadbeen fired and replaced by Saddam Hussein's son-in-law.   The rationing was imposed not because Iraq was short of oil - itcontrols 20 percent of the world's supply - but reportedly becausethe additives needed for gasoline refining were affected by theglobal embargo.   At the time, Iraqi officials blamed the sanctions for causingthe shortage.   But the news agency said the Oil Ministry had miscalculated theamount of chemical additives necessary to refine crude oil intogasoline and other products.   The New York Times, quoting Kuwaiti oil officials, reportedSunday the rationing move was simply a ruse by Iraq to get theworld to think the sanctions were working, and thus to forestall amilitary attack against Iraq. Their report was published before thelatest Iraqi announcement.   In other developments, an envoy from Soviet President Mikhail S.Gorbachev held talks with Iraqi President Saddam in Baghdad, andGorbachev arrived in Paris for talks with French President FrancoisMitterrand on matters including the nearly 3-month-old Persian Gulfcrisis.   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze said Sunday nightthat envoy Yevgeny Primakov's talks with Saddam had not bornefruit.   ``For the moment, there are not many reasons for optimism''coming from the talks, Shevardnadze said in Paris. He did notelaborate, but said he was still hopeful for a peaceful resolutionof the crisis.   In Iraq, 301 French nationals were told they had to wait anotherday for freedom. The Baghdad government said last week that theycould return home, but the trip was delayed from Sunday untilMonday.   Diplomatic sources said the departure was put off because 26other French citizens were unaccounted for.   The Parisian newspaper Journal du Dimanche said France mightclose its embassy in Kuwait and send the remaining diplomats homewith the other French citizens. The report did not cite sources.   Iraq announced Aug. 24 that all embassies in Kuwait City shouldclose, and it cut off water and electricity to the compounds. Oneby one, the embassies have closed, and the French, U.S. and Britishmissions are the only Western ones remaining open.   Saddam has allowed isolated groups of the thousands of foreignnationals held in Iraq and occupied Kuwait to leave.   He is holding hundreds of the foreigners as ``human shields'' atstrategic sites to deter attack by the multinational force in thePersian Gulf.   Iraq's selective release of hostages - and concessions it hasdemanded from some nations in exchange for their freedom - hasdrawn criticism from world leaders, who say it is merely a ploy todivide them.   European Community leaders, holding a summit in Rome, pledged onSunday not to send official representatives to win the freedom ofhostages, and to discourage any private missions.   In a joint statement, the leaders assailed the ``unscrupulous''use of hostages in the ``vain attempt to divide the internationalcommunity.''   ``They condemn without reserve this maneuver ... which can onlycomplicate the prospects of a solution of the crisis,'' thedeclaration said.   In Athens, Greece, the Foreign Ministry said Sunday that Iraqagreed to release 10 Greek hostages suffering from ill health. Nodetails about the health problems of the nine men and one womanwere given.   The statement did not say when Iraqi officials may free thehostages, among 24 Greeks being held in Iraq.   Two former Greek socialist ministers left Baghdad on Sundayafter seeking the release of the hostages.   In the latest naval confrontation, U.S. Marines boarded an Iraqitanker after an Australian vessel and a U.S. warship fired warningshots across its bow when it refused to stop, U.S. Navy officialssaid.   The ship, intercepted in the North Arabian Sea, was allowed toproceed after a search party found no goods banned under the U.N.sanctions.   The ship, headed for Basra, Iraq, had refused to stop and allowa boarding party before the shots were fired. The Marines boardedby helicopter.   As of Oct. 26, some 2,738 ships had been intercepted in the gulfregion, and 282 ships boarded.   Gorbachev arrived in Paris after a visit to Spain, during whichhe and Shevardnadze suggested Iraq may have softened its stand inthe gulf crisis.   Primakov met Sunday with Saddam in his second trip to Iraq thismonth. Iraqi officials made no comment afterward.   Primakov also met twice with Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz,the second an unscheduled session late Sunday, a PalestineLiberation Organization official said. Primakov also met in Baghdadwith PLO chairman Yasser Arafat, the official said.   The Soviet envoy was expected to go to Saudi Arabia on Monday tobrief King Fahd on his talks with Saddam, a Soviet diplomat said.   Primakov has emerged as the main shuttling diplomat in theconflict, which began when Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2 and occupiedthe emirate. Iraq was in turn isolated by U.N. trade sanctions andwidespread international condemnation.   Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak, meanwhile, told reportersSunday he supported an increase in U.S. and other military forcesin the region while peacemaking efforts continue. Mubarak said hewas ready to send more Egyptian troops if asked.   The United States has said that up to 100,000 U.S. troops couldbe sent to join an estimated 220,000 troops already in the region.The multinational force has another 100,000 troops. They face anestimated 460,000 Iraqi soldiers deployed in southern Iraq andKuwait.   In a speech at Hickam Air Force Base, in Honolulu, PresidentBush said the United States was not looking for war in the PersianGulf but would not walk away from the confrontation.   ``It's clear that the strength of our arms and the strength ofour will is up to the challenge,'' Bush said.   ``No American will be kept in the gulf a single day longer thannecessary, but we will not walk away until our mission is done,''he said.</TEXT></DOC>
