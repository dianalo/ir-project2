That enormous change atthe core of communism, the Soviet Union, is the focus of the secondstory in a five-part Easter series, ``Resurrection of Nations.''</TEXT><BYLINE>GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   When Secretary of State James A. Baker III met with SovietForeign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze in Wyoming last fall, theyexchanged gifts. Baker gave cowboy boots to Shevardnadze, whopresented Baker with an enameled picture of Jesus teaching thepeople.   ``You see,'' Shevardnadze remarked, ``even we communists arechanging our world view.''   Recalling the incident later, Baker surmised that some innate``resurgence of faith'' may have been at the roots of therevolutionary changes sweeping Eastern Europe.   The lightning-like reformation that has flashed over the Sovietcolossus and its peripheries is ``so striking that it marks thebeginning of a new era of world affairs,'' President Bush said inhis state-of-the-union address.   It is a kind of metaphor for Easter, a rebirth of worldly hopes,a resurrection of regimented millions from capitivity.   ``It has raised the spirits of oppressed people all over theworld, not only in Eastern Europe but in South Africa andelsewhere,'' said the dean of U.S. Roman Catholic historians,Monsignor John Tracy Ellis.   The reanimation swelled in the Soviet heartland after racingaround its borders at the end of 1989. The Soviet parliament votedFeb. 27 to surrender the Communist Party's constitutional monopolyof power as society's ``guiding force,'' a step approved last monthby the 2,250-member Congress of People's Deputies.   This was an historic turning point for Soviet communism, areversal of a constitutionally enshrined belief that only the partycontrolled the nation.   Abandoning that dogma, said Roman Szporiuk, Russian studiesdirector at the University of Michigan, had seemed as implausibleas a declaration from ``the pope in Rome that there is no God.''   Measures also were adopted to create a Western-style presidencyand executive branch cabinet.   The Congress of People's Deputies, a popularly elected bodyestablished only a year ago, includes several church leaders andmany non-communists. It meets annually and elects the 542-memberstanding parliament, the Supreme Soviet. The deputies electedGorbachev to a five-year term as president; in 1995, the officebecomes subject to national voting.   Popular elections and other freedoms, including approval oflong-banned individual property rights and budding free enterprise,have proliferated across that once totalitarian nation.   Sergei A. Kovalev, who spent a decade in labor camps, said ofhis March victory in the first round of voting for the Russianrepublic's parliament that he could not previously have imaginedsuch change.   An unseen ``mole of history'' has been digging, he said.``People could not foresee this fast time frame. The mostoptimistic of us only could hope for such changes across 100years.''   Communist repressions had weighed for nearly three quarters ofthe 20th century on the Soviet Union. For its satellite nations,the Nazi occupation that began in 1938-39 gave way to Sovietdomination after World War II.   Tens of thousands of Soviet citizens were tortured, herded intoslave labor camps or executed under the ruthless 24-year rule ofJoseph Stalin. He established an absolutist police state thatcontrolled every aspect of society. The despotism continued withvarying degrees of severity through Stalin's successors. The partywas a tiny minority of 19 million in a population of 287 million,but its bureaucrats, KGB agents and informers restricted religion;muzzled speech, print and broadcasts; forbade ownership orassemblies; jailed dissenters, and promoted atheism as the statereligion, an official belief of disbelief.   In March 1985, a different kind of communist _ Mikhail S.Gorbachev, charismatic and tactically nimble _ took over the party.The rigid communist autocracy began loosening its grip.   ``We need spiritual values, we need a revolution of the mind,''Gorbachev said on the eve of his unprecedented meeting with PopeJohn Paul II last Dec. 1, at which the Soviet leader agreed to end45 years of suppressing Ukrainian Catholicism. ``We have changedour attitude about some matters such as religion.''   Gorbachev himself was baptized in infancy and reared in RussianOrthodoxy by a devout mother.   ``Now we not only proceed from the assumption that no one shouldinterfere in matters of individual conscience,'' he said. ``We alsosay that the moral values that religion generated and embodied forcenturies can help in the work of renewal in our country.''   All around Gorbachev, strains of liberty burst forth. In hishomeland, political prisoners went free, debate flew wide open,diversity bloomed, the superstructure loosened and privateinitiative took toddling steps.   People emigrated more freely _ 71,196 Jews left the Soviet Unionin 1989, the most ever, and 100,000 are expected to do so in 1990 _while regular religious programming began for the first time onradio and television.   This ``is the day of resurrection for our church,'' BishopInnocent Lotocky of Chicago's Ukrainian-rite Catholics said of thelifted ban on the church in the Ukraine. ``Our church was crucifiedby the communists and sealed in the tomb,'' but now it lives again.   Russian Orthodoxy reported the number of its active churchesincreased by almost 3,000 in 1989 to a total of 9,734. Seminariesand enrollments multiplied fourfold.   Similar expansion occurred among Protestant churches. Baptistsreceived permission to open their first seminary. Churches beganthe previously forbidden religious instruction of children.   Soviet policy has shifted in 18 months ``from tolerance toactive promotion'' of churches, said Philip Oke of theinterdenominational Christian Peace Conference and a frequentvisitor to Eastern Europe.   Bibles and other religious literature poured into the SovietUnion. Bible societies formed, and the Academy of Science approveda research project on personal values, using the Ten Commandments.   The Society for Scientific Atheism changed its name to theSociety of Religion and Atheism. A Baptist choir performed at agovernment cultural center, and a U.S-produced evangelistic movie,``Jesus,'' dubbed into Russian, drew big audiences.   The striking changes were presaged at the 1988 celebration ofChristianity's thousandth anniversary in Russia. Fervent crowds,the presence of 500 church leaders from around the world and theparticipation of Soviet officials, as well as Gorbachev's wife,Raisa, left a lingering influence.   ``You are entering a new period of history for the nation,''American evangelist Billy Graham said then.   Since then, one after another, old communist orders have fallen_ gradually in Poland and Hungry, swiftly in East Germany,Czechoslovakia and Romania.   Impulses of independence have flared in some of the 15 Sovietrepublics, chiefly the Baltic states led by mostly CatholicLithuania.   God's Spirit, Jesus said, is like the wind which ``blows whereit wills.''</TEXT><HEAD>NEXT: East Germany's Breakout</HEAD><NOTE>End Adv for Tuesday AMs, April 10</NOTE></DOC>
