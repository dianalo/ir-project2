Gen. Jannie Geldenhuys said air force fighter aircraftsuccessfully carried out attacks on South-West African People'sOrganization targets in Lubango and Ongiva in southern Angola.   He said the attacks were in retaliation Friday's bombing of theFirst National Bank in Oshakati, South-West Africa, where 18 peoplewere killed and 31 injured.   Geldenhuys said SWAPO, which has been fighting for 22 yearsagainst South African occupation of the territory, also known asNamibia, was responsible for the lunch-hour bomb.   A statement Friday from the SWAPO office in Luanda, Angola,denied involvement in the bombing, and said it was part of a SouthAfrican propaganda campaign to ``smear the name of SWAPO.''   The guerrillas fight in South-West Africa, also known asNamibia, from bases in southern Angola that periodically are raidedby the South African Defense Force.   Eight Mirage fighters took part in the attack on two targetsnear Lubango, 186 miles north of the Namibian-Angolan border; andfive Impala aircraft attacked targets at Ongiva, 26 miles north ofthe border, the statement said.   Geldenhuys said the Lubango targets were ``SWAPO's mostimportant training center in Angola, the Tobias Hainyeko TrainingCenter, and a terrorist holding area about 10 kms (6.2 miles) westof there.''   He said SWAPO guerrillas receive training in the handling ofexplosives at the Tobias Hainyeko Center, which he said, ``can beregarded as the breeding ground for terrorism against theinhabitants of South-West Africa-Namibia.''   SWAPO had launched a number of raids from Ongiva recently oncivilians in South-West Africa, the general said.   ``By these attacks the security forces demonstrated theirwillingness never to allow SWAPO terrorism to go unpunished,''Geldenhuys said. ``Terrorists will be tracked down and destroyed.''   Friday's bank blast was the deadliest in 22 years of war betweenthe black guerrillas and the minority white government of SouthAfrica.   Among the dead in the blast in the far-northern town of Oshakatiwere 10 women, three men and a child. All the victims were black,except for one white woman who was identified today in apro-government newspaper as the wife of a member of a specialpolice unit.   Four of the bodies were discovered in the rubble Friday night,said The Citizen newspaper.   Of the 31 people injured, 20 of them were black, said an armyspokesman, Cmdt. Lieb Bester.   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast,which destroyed the bank building. Five people were injured when anexplosion occurred in the street near the same bank a year ago.   Chris Ball, managing director of the First National Bank, flewto Windhoek to visit the scene Friday afternoon. He called thebombing ``a barbarous and senseless attack on the community ofOshakati, achieving nothing.''   All those killed were civilians, Bester said. Most were believedto be local government employees who had just been paid.   A police inspector, Keirie Du Rand, said about 55 pounds ofplastic explosive was used in the blast, which occurred shortlybefore 1 p.m. He said a fire raged for several hours after theexplosion, hampering police access to the scene.   Oshakati is in north-central Namibia, about 25 miles south ofthe Angolan border. It is home to the largest military base in theregion, a staging point for South Africa's current militaryintervention in Angola's civil war.   SWAPO has claimed responsibility for numerous previous bombingsin the territory, including a blast last month at a store at amilitary base in Windhoek.</TEXT></DOC>
