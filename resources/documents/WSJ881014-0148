Private lines are generally used by big companies that route computer and voice communications among different branches. For the past three years, many of these large communications users have accused local phone companies, including the regional Bell companies and GTE Corp., of price-gouging for basing prices for some private lines on profit margins as high as 40%.    The FCC is responsible for assessing whether phone rates are &quot;just and reasonable.&quot; It allows the regional Bells, for instance, to earn a profit margin of 12% on their entire private-line business. But in 1985, the Bells and other local telephone companies started calculating rates for some private lines based on profit margins two or three times greater than the profit margins allowed for the private-line category as a whole.    The telephone companies called that policy &quot;strategic pricing&quot; because, they argued, the steep prices kept big companies in the public phone network and permitted them to avoid driving up costs for remaining callers. The FCC allowed the rates to take effect, but launched an investigation of the tactic.    Yesterday, the agency voted 3-0 to allow &quot;strategic pricing&quot; in principle, but to restrict when phone companies may use it. &quot;A (telephone) carrier should have some flexibility, but relatively limited flexibility,&quot; said Gerald Brock, chief of the FCC's common-carrier bureau.    The FCC said local phone companies had to structure their prices so that customers weren't charged more for low-cost services than for high-cost ones. In addition, the phone companies couldn't price services so high, in comparison to costs, that they would &quot;hinder a customer's choice of services (or) the development of new technologies.&quot;    Brian Moir, counsel for the International Communications Association, a trade group of large telecommunications users, said that prices for private lines violate those precepts. Some companies, he said, won't hook up central computers to remote facilities because it costs too much to communicate by private lines.    Mr. Moir estimated that business customers could receive a refund of as much as $25 million if the FCC finds that the local companies have overcharged.    But Robert Bennis, a senior telecommunications consultant to Westinghouse Electric Corp., doubted that the agency would order refunds. &quot;I've never seen them before&quot; in an FCC proceeding, he said.    The FCC gave local phone companies using strategic pricing 30 days to show that their prices meet the agency's new criteria. Telecommunications customers then have 15 days to respond to the filings. Mr. Brock said he hoped the agency would decide by the end of January whether the rates were appropriate or whether phone companies would have to make refunds. </TEXT></DOC>
