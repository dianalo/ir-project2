The human rights group said the detainees ``seem to have beenarrested arbitrarily because of their ethnic origin and their familyconnections with other government opponents.''   An Amnesty statement said all detainees were of the Zaghawaethnic group, which comes from the northeast portion of the formerFrench colony, and that the Chad government has disclosed nothingabout them.   ``Amnesty International has received reports of both torture andextra-judicial executions of suspected government opponents atsecret detention centers in N'djamena (the capital),'' the statementsaid.   Amnesty said it is ``therefore concerned, both that thesedetainees may be subjected to torture and that their lives may be indanger.''   It named six of them, all brothers of Sidik Fadoul, former headof military police in a coalition that governed Chad from 1979 to1982.   It said Fadoul was arrested in 1988 when he returned voluntarilyto Chad, having been personally assured by President Hissene Habrethat he would not be persecuted.   It identified the brothers as Professor Zakaria Fadoul, head ofthe linguistics department at the University of Chad; Saleh Fadoul,a bank employee; Mahamat Fadoul, a Radio Chad journalist; MahamatDen Fadoul, a driver; and Ali and Yacoub Fadoul, both merchants.   The coup leaders reportedly plotted a takeover after the Habre'sAnakaza tribe attempted to secure key government administrative andmilitary posts. The coup plotters hoped to maintain the Hadjarai andZakawa tribes in the government, sources said.   According to Chad authorities, the coup attempt was made on April1 and was led by Interior Minister Ibrahim Mahamat Itno, armedforces chief Hassan Djamous and his predecessor, Idriss Debi.   France and the United States consider Chad strategic because ofits position between Libya and Zaire and between Nigeria and Sudan.France has sent troops to Chad twice since 1983 to head off Libyanincursions.   Habre has been president since 1982, when he ousted aLibyan-backed government led by Goukouni Oueddei.   Chad gained its independence from France in 1960.</TEXT></DOC>
