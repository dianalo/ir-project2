Mass spectrometry (MS) was used to obtainhelium leak rates and the gas flow was plotted against time. The gasquantity determined by MS was first obtained at various temperaturesuntil no helium leak rate was detected. After that, these samples wereirradiated with fast neutrons to produce helium which was measured again.This procedure was used to estimate the experimental error. The quantityof helium produced by interaction of gamma radiation with beryl mineralswas theoretically calculated from the amount of thorium-232 at the neighbourhoodof the samples. The quantity of helium produced in the minerals due touranium and thorium decay was calculated using the amount of these heavyelements, and the results were compared with the amounts determined byMS. The amount of potassium-40 was determined in order to derive thequantity of argonium-40, since some workers found argonium in excessin these minerals. The quantity of helium in the beryl samples (s) wasdetermined in the center and in the surface of the samples in order toobtain informations about the effectiveness of the Be({alpha}, eta) Hereaction. Beryl and phenacite minerals were choosen in this researchsince they are opposite each other with respect to the helium contents.Both have beryllium in their compositon but beryl hold a large amountof helium while phenacite, in spite of having about three times moreberyllium than beryl, do not hold the gas.</TEXT></DOC>
