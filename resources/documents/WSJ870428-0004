The resolution, which was sponsored by several church and labor groups, was rejected by a vote of 418.8 million to 21.6 million. As previously reported, IBM has sold its South African unit to an employee trust, International Services Management Ltd., but the former subsidiary continues to distribute IBM products.    While commending Armonk, N.Y.-based IBM for selling its South African operation, the sponsors of the resolution said the company didn't go far enough. Kirk Jones, who represents the American Baptist Foreign Mission Society, said IBM products &quot;continue to bolster the apartheid economy.&quot;    IBM said after the meeting that the company has a responsibility to its former employees and customers in South Africa to continue to sell products there. In addition, the company noted that its agreement with International Services Management conforms with U.S. export regulations prohibiting the sale of products to the police, the military &quot;or apartheid-enforcing agencies.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
