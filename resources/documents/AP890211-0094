Hussein Mahdavi, a senior official of the Iraqi-based MujahedeenKhalq, or People's Holy Warriors, would not say how long it mighttake to overthrow Iran's Islamic fundamentalist government, which iscelebrating its 10th anniversary.   ``If you look at the divisions ... inside the Khomeini regime,and compare it to the resistance ready at any time to overthrow theregime, you cannot seriously speak about needing years,'' he said ina recent interview with The Associated Press. ``We've shown that wehave the ability to militarily overthrow this regime.''   The Mujahedeen's military arm, the National Liberation Army, madea large-scale incursion into western Iran just before the Aug. 20cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war.   The rebels still hand out literature by the pound claiming theraid, called Eternal Light, was a major victory, but diplomats sayKhomeini's Revolutionary Guards soundly beat the insurgents.   The Mujahedeen is believed to have no more than 15,000 fighters,and it admits losing 1,000 in the raid. In addition, thousands oftheir supporters in Iran were arrested and many were believedexecuted.   Diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Eternal Lightundermined whatever support the rebels had in Iran.   Talk of overthrowing Khomeini is ``sheer dreaming and sheerstupidity'' said one Western military analyst, who spoke oncondition of anonymity. ``What could they do? Where would they go?They got destroyed in the Eternal Light operation.''   Much of Iran's civilian population has been moved away from theborder during the Iran-Iraq war, so capturing territory would be alimited threat to the government, analysts said.   They argued that since the million-strong, high-tech Iraqi armycould not overwhelm the Iranians in eight years of war, it is highlyunlikely the rebels could.   Even if the rebels did have an army ready to cross the border,the analysts said, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein appears committedto peace negotiations and probably would not allow the insurgents toattack.   Iraqi officials declined to comment on the Mujahedeen's future.   ``Everything on those issues will be dependent on Iranianbehavior,'' said deputy Foreign Minister Nizar Hamdoon. ``It'spremature to address this point at the moment.''   The Mujahedeen appear to have broad support in Iraq. They stillbroadcast a nightly half-hour television program and one diplomatnoted the post office box listed on their official paper is the sameused by the Culture and Information Ministry.   But Iraq has expelled Iranian resistance groups before. Khomeinihimself spent 15 years in the holy city of Najaf but was asked toleave in 1978 during a moment of detente in Iran-Iraq relations.   Mahdavi conceded a peace treaty might mean Iraq would bar theMujahedeen from staging military operations across the border. Hewould not say if the rebels are conducting operations now.   The Mujahedeen were allied with Khomeini in the 1979 revolutionthat toppled Iran's monarchy. But the fundamentalists turned ontheir liberal allies in 1981 and killed thousands in a bloody purge.   Peace negotiations between Iran and Iraq have been stalled sinceNovember. Mahdavi accused Iran of delaying talks because of internaldifferences and said a treaty might trigger a civil war.   ``At that time the NLA ... will embark on overthrowing theKhomeini regime,'' Mahdavi said.</TEXT></DOC>
