In the year-ago quarter, the healthfoods retailer earned $1.4 million, or four cents a share, on sales of $75.8 million. Its per-share forecast for the current quarter indicates the company will report net income of between $660,000 and $1 million.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, General Nutrition shares closed at $5.625, down 37.5 cents.    General Nutrition said that the losses in the manufacturing and mail-order divisions more than offset a strong performance by the retail division. The company said the manufacturing division loss reflects a previously announced program to reduce inventories. </TEXT></DOC>
