Gorbachev won sweeping newpowers over a reorganized executive branch Tuesday, despite ForeignMinister Eduard A. Shevardnadze's warning that the country washeading toward dictatorship.   Gorbachev turned back attempts by reformist lawmakers to limithis authority to issue presidential decrees, which he says he needsalong with government reorganization to restore order in thecountry. He angrily said such restriction would be the ``funeral ofexecutive power.''   Approval by the 2,250-member Congress of People's Deputies was aclear victory for Gorbachev and for hard-line lawmakers who haveurged emergency rule over secessionist republics. In his stunningresignation speech Thursday, Shevardnadze said hard-liners werepushing this country to dictatorship.   Parliament voted overwhelmingly for constitutional amendmentsthat eliminate Gorbachev's moribund Presidential Council, create apowerful new vice presidency subordinate to Gorbachev, and form anew Cabinet of Ministers under Gorbachev's direct control.   It strengthened Gorbachev's existing Federation Council, thecenterpiece of his reorganization, but modified his vision of it asa small governing body, creating doubt about its effectiveness.   The council is intended to give republics a greater voice innational government and help the Kremlin deal with the nation'smore than 100 ethnic groups. It will also try to settle themultiple regional conflicts, which have led to bloodshed in theCaucasus, Moldavia and Central Asia.   The changes will go into effect only after a final vote expectedWednesday or Thursday. The Congress still must consider proposedamendments on the restructuring, including one that would create anational Security Council led by the president.   The Congress is due to finish work by Friday.   The flurry of votes came on the session's eighth day, afterShevardnadze's resignation and Saturday's harsh speech by KGB chiefVladimir Kryuchkov accusing foreign agents of plotting against theKremlin.   Some reform-minded lawmakers expressed outrage over giving thepresident more power.   ``Haven't we learned anything from the resignation ofShevardnadze over the coming dictatorship?'' asked Vologda deputyVladimir Lopatin.   Congress chairman Anatoly Lukyanov cut off Lopatin's microphone,saying he was not speaking about the amendment at hand.   Before the session began Tuesday, Russian republic leader BorisN. Yeltsin condemned plans to broaden Gorbachev's power and said heintended to vote against them in the parliament, the state newsagency Tass said.   Yeltsin, Gorbachev's leading political rival, said he opposed``absolute powers for the president of the U.S.S.R,'' according tothe independent news agency Interfax.   Gorbachev wants to establish a strong presidency, combined witha new Union Treaty, to hold the country together. The Congressendorsed the concept of the Union Treaty on Monday and ordered the15 republics to set dates for referenda on whether to stay in theSoviet Union.   Gorbachev strolled into the lobby during a break in the sessionand said his strategy would settle political crises.   ``I am sure that if we come to understand each other in the nextfew months, we shall be able to stabilize within the next year,''he said.   The parliament voted 1,514-140, with 140 abstentions, to revampand strengthen the Federation Council, created last March.   Gorbachev and the new vice president would head the council. Itwould include high-level officials from the 15 republics and about20 autonomous republics, plus special representatives from smallerregions, officials said.   It would have 35-40 standing members, but up to 150 people couldattend meetings, making it a small ``general assembly,'' saidAlexander Kudryavtsev, chairman of the commission that drafted theamendments.   How effective the Federation Council could be as ruling bodywith that many people was unclear. Gorbachev initially had notintended to include so many.   The parliament voted 1,620-35, with 73 abstentions, to create aCabinet of Ministers, which will be an ``executive andadministrative organ of the Soviet Union ... subordinate to thepresident.''   It would oversee the economy, with responsibility for financialand monetary policy, energy, transportation, communications andother fields.   The present Council of Ministers, under Prime Minister NikolaiRyzhkov, answers to the national Supreme Soviet legislature and hasexercised a degree of independence from Gorbachev, particularlyover economic matters.   The vice president might take over some functions now performedby the prime minister.   Gorbachev has said nothing of possible candidates for the newjob except that he had planned to nominate Shevardnadze. Theforeign minister has said he would not accept the post.   The deputies voted to eliminate the 9-month-old PresidentialCouncil, which had been envisioned as a new Cabinet but was stifledby conflicts with Ryzhkov's Council of Ministers.   To Gorbachev's annoyance, reformers repeatedly proposedamendments to require legislative approval for his decrees, eachtime falling short of the two-thirds majority needed.   Gorbachev now can issue orders without any oversight, althoughmany republics have been ignoring the decrees.   ``If every day the president has to issue orders ... and each ofthem has to be ratified by the Supreme Soviet ... then I tell you,that's the funeral of executive power. It would be better to leavethings as they are,'' Gorbachev said.</TEXT></DOC>
