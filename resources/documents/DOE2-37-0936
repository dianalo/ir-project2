Prices graduallydeclined throughout the month, except for a brief upward surge followingnews of the United Nations sponsored cease-fire which ended, at leasttemporarily, the armed conflict between Iran and Iraq. Some members ofthe Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), continued toboost their own production to bolster their negotiating positions infuture quota disputes. Although production increases had become a clearthreat to prices by the end of the month, the continued hope of OPECaction to save the quota system appeared to forestall a collapse of themarket. In the United States, the composite refiner acquisition costof crude oil fell 39 cents (2.7 percent) to $14.32 per barrel in August.While motor gasoline sales were flat, substantial increases in salesof No. 2 and residual fuel oils and propane led to a 2.2 percent overallincrease in refiner sales of the major petroleum products. This was accompaniedby a rise in refiner retail motor gasoline prices of 1.9 cents per gallon(2.7 percent). 12 figs., 53 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
