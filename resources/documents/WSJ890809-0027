But now Mr. Forstmann has upset his fellow merger makers by taking his fight with Mr. Kravis to Washington. To hear some of Wall Street's big-time deal makers tell it, Mr. Forstmann, after losing many a bidding war, is trying to use Congress to clip his rival's wings by changing the tax laws.    The essential facts are clear. At a breakfast meeting with members of the House Ways and Means Committee and in an article in the Washington Post, Mr. Forstmann urged Congress to eliminate the corporate tax deduction for bonds that don't pay interest in cash. The committee adopted a similar proposal, which now stands a good chance of becoming law, that would eliminate such deductions on non-cash interest paid on high-yield junk bonds.    Mr. Forstmann was virtually alone among major LBO players in advocating the tax-law change, which could slow LBO activity. Mr. Kravis, partner in Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., the nation's biggest buy-out firm, arranged a separate breakfast meeting with the panel to argue against any such change.    Mr. Kravis's firm has been a big user of securities that pay non-cash or deferred interest, and such securities have helped him to outbid other LBO players, including Mr. Forstmann, to win multibillion-dollar companies. Such securities provided about 23% of Mr. Kravis's financing for the biggest LBO ever, the $30 billion acquisition of RJR Nabisco Inc.    Mr. Forstmann's firm, Forstmann Little andamp; Co., doesn't use such securities in putting together his bids; he's even termed them &quot;the fake 'wampum' of 1980s finance.&quot;    The rivalry between Mr. Kravis and Mr. Forstmann, the No. 1 and No. 2 players in the LBO game, is so intense that Mr. Kravis refused, by two accounts, to attend the same committee breakfast meeting as Mr. Forstmann, who was eager to debate Mr. Kravis on the subject.    People who know him say Mr. Forstmann resents and envies Mr. Kravis. While Mr. Kravis has done a series of ever bigger deals culminating in the record RJR buy-out, Mr. Forstmann -- whose $2.7 billion LBO fund ranks second in size to KKR's -- has sat out much of the action on the belief that prices have reached unreasonably high levels.    Since January 1987, Mr. Forstmann has announced two buy-outs, totaling $1.2 billion. Mr. Kravis's score for the same period is 14 deals with a total value of $37.35 billion, according to Securities Data Corp. In the Washington Post article, Mr. Forstmann complained that leveraged buy-out firms using non-cash bonds and preferred stock &quot;have been able to justify virtually any price for any company.&quot;    Thomas Quinn, a lawyer at the Washington firm of O'Connor andamp; Hannan who helped guide Mr. Forstmann's lobbying efforts, acknowledges that his client's actions risk alienating his fellow deal makers. &quot;No one wants to make enemies among their fraternal group.&quot; Mr. Forstmann and Mr. Kravis both declined to comment.    The proposed tax-law change is likely to do far more than heat up the rivalry between the two men. It could also slow the pace of LBO activity and thereby help put a damper on stock prices. Most recent LBOs have featured some form of securities with non-cash payments; these now comprise about $30 billion of the $195 billion junk bond market, according to a First Boston Corp. estimate.    The Ways and Means Committee proposal would eliminate tax deductions for interest on two kinds of bonds: zero-coupon bonds that don't pay any interest until maturity and are sold at a deep discount to their face value, and &quot;payment-in-kind,&quot; or PIK, bonds that make interest payments in the form of more bonds, rather than in cash. The provision would only apply to bonds that have a term of more than five years and pay yields of at least five percentage points more than U.S. Treasury securities of comparable maturity.    Investment bankers believe the proposal's main effect would be to reduce the prices that bidders pay to take companies private. &quot;To the extent that a company is being sold and the potential bidders are largely financial buyers, removing the deductability of interest on zeros has one relatively simple impact -- it just changes the pricing,&quot; says James Maher, head of investment banking at First Boston Corp. &quot;It's not an enormous difference. It's perhaps 5%, or maybe more, but not 20%,&quot; Mr. Maher says.    The proposal has already depressed the stock of one company, American Medical International Inc., whose proposed $3.35 billion buy-out could be affected by the tax proposal. American Medical announced its buy-out just before the Ways and Means tax proposal was unveiled, but hasn't yet completed the transaction; it's not clear whether the new law would apply to the American Medical deal.    Nonetheless, American Medical shares have fallen more than $1 each from their level right after the deal was announced, closing yesterday at $24.875 each, up 25 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    To be sure, some LBO specialists view the latest tax proposal as a big victory, considering the intensity of the congressional hostility towards buy-outs that was spurred by the RJR Nabisco deal.    A leading advocate of curbing buy-outs is Rep. Byron Dorgan (D., N.D.), a member of the Ways and Means Committee and a current ally of Mr. Forstmann. &quot;I am convinced that junk bonds are the engines that drive hostile takeovers,&quot; Rep. Dorgan says. &quot;And part of what has fueled it is the inbred subsidy of interest deductions,&quot; he says.    Rep. Dorgan says that Mr. Forstmann played a key role in focusing the committee's attention on the use of payment-in-kind and zero-coupon securities and the effect that eliminating the interest deduction for such securities could have in slowing down buy-outs. &quot;I think Ted feels very strongly and got a lot of people interested in one thing,&quot; Rep. Dorgan says.    However, Mr. Forstmann hasn't always advocated government action to curb supposed excesses in the buy-out business.    Last October, during the battle for RJR Nabisco, Mr. Forstmann wrote an article for the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal that attacked highly leveraged, junk-bond-funded deals, but said that &quot;legislation is not the answer because it will create more problems than it cures. Markets and their particpants must correct their own inefficiencies.&quot;    But six months later, in the Washington Post, Mr. Forstmann wrote an article advocating a specific legislative solution. &quot;There is one change that will appeal to all but the users of the most egregious varieties of these securities: Require that unless interest is paid in cash, it cannot be deducted for taxes. Such a change would have a direct impact on many of the excesses that have evolved but would leave traditional debt and equity alone.&quot;    Though Mr. Forstmann's advice clearly struck a responsive chord among members of the Ways and Means panel, its members added a twist of their own. They proposed outlawing the interest deduction only for payment-in-kind or zero-coupon bonds that have high yields. Companies with investment-grade credit ratings that can issue debt at lower interest rates would still be allowed to deduct PIK or zero-coupon interest payments.    That targeting of junk bonds upsets companies that have thrived on junk financing. &quot;They're giving up on the careful legal and business definitions of when an instrument is debt and when it is equity and moving toward more simplistic and arbitrary definitions,&quot; says David Alyward, executive director of Alliance for Capital Access, a Washington lobbying group funded by companies that issue junk bonds. </TEXT></DOC>
