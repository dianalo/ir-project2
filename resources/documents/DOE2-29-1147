The Company has at present over 20 sites, all remote radiorepeaters, which are powered by alternate energy power systems. Thispaper discusses the types of power systems, problems encountered, andhow these problems have been solved. Small photovoltaic systems havebeen installed at 17 sites, having peak loads of 50 watts at an averageannual duty cycle of 10%. To date, two incidents resulting in loss ofservice have been reported. Cycle charge systems, designed for loadsup to 400 watts, use combined photovoltaic array and diesel generatorwith associated batteries. Current systems are sized so that the dieseloperates one day in six. Hybrid systems, using wind turbines, photovoltaics,and diesel were designed for loads over 400 watts, and are suited tonorth coastal regions with large wind regimes. The systems at Swindleand Calvert Islands are described in some detail, including their datalogging and microprocessor controller systems. Problems have been encounteredwith damage to blades and with some of the diesel engine and generatorcomponents, but overall performance has been a qualified success. Examinationof fuel consumption shows that similar sites operating with just a primepower generator system would have consumed over 8 times the amount offuel in the same period. 1 fig., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
