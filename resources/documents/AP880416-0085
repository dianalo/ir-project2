SUAREZ</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Troops raided a hideout of thefugitive leader of August's attempted coup and scoured otherneighborhoods for rebels, the military said Saturday.   The nation's armed forces remained on full alert to block anycoup attempt while President Corazon Aquino was on a four-day tripto China and Hong Kong. She was to return Sunday.   The raiders did not find former Lt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo''Honasan in the hideout, an automobile repair shop in suburbanQuezon City. But they seized his motorcycle and military uniforms,the officials said.   The raid came late Friday after troops captured 10 of hisfollowers in a nearby house.   Chief military spokesman Col. Oscar Florendo said they includedeight of 14 navy guards who helped him escape his prison ship April2. He had been held there since his December arrest for the failedcoup on Aug. 28 that left 53 dead and 300 hurt.   The military said the 10 arrests foiled a plot to attack thepresidential palace.   A report to Defense Secretary Fidel V. Ramos said governmentforces were still looking for rebels. It gave no details, and Ramostold reporters only that the operations were being carried out inundisclosed neighborhoods.   Before flying to Hong Kong Saturday, Mrs. Aquino told reportersin Beijing she was ``very happy'' about the capture of the 10Honasan followers.   The military believed Honasan used a small room in the auto shopas his sleeping quarters, the government's television stationreported Saturday. It said the raiders also found a device used toreload 45-caliber bullets, a dictionary, a bible and canned foodinside the room.   Col. Emilio Templo, commander of the 300-member squad making thearrests, said the plotters planned to approach the palace by rubberboats down a tributary of the PasigRiver, which flows behind thebuilding in the heart of the capital.   But the military was tipped off about the plot, ``so we actedquickly,'' Templo said. ``We preempted the plan.''   Honasan was a key figure in the civilian-backed military revoltthat ousted former President Ferdinand Marcos and swept Mrs. Aquinoto power on Feb. 25, 1986.   But Honasan became disenchanted with Mrs. Aquino and led theAugust coup attempt, the most serious of six bids to unseat Mrs.Aquino since she became president.   A military statement said officials were questioning thearrested navy soldiers and some had admitted receiving bribes fromHonasan to help him escape. One told investigators that married menin the group were given $100 and bachelors received $65 each, thestatement said.   Officials said the group offered no resistance although theywere found in possession of 16 M-14 rifles, four M-16s, one lightmachine gun, five Israeli-made Uzi machine guns and a grenade.   They told authorities they didn't know where Honasan was hiding,according to the military statement.</TEXT></DOC>
