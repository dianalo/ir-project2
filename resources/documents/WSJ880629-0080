The forecast prepared by NPA Data Services Inc. anticipates continued growth in the Sun Belt at the expense of much of the rest of the nation, a trend that has been increasingly evident in recent decades.    Of the 40 areas noted in the study, 11 are in California, six in Florida, five in Texas and two each in Arizona and North Carolina.    The 40 areas are expected to add 13,195,000 people between 1986 and 2000.    By comparison, the U.S. as a whole is expected to add 26,616,000 people in that period. That means the 40 areas would account for 49.57% of all national growth.    The Los Angeles-Long Beach area is expected to lead the growth, adding 1,017,000 people during the period. Several other areas, including Houston, Atlanta, Dallas and Washington, are likely to be in the 500,000-to-1 million category, the report says.    NPA, which provides national and regional economic projections, noted that growth between 1986 and 2000 is expected to be slightly less than in the 1980-86 period, reflecting a general slowdown in population growth in the nation.    Between 1980 and 1986 the population grew by an average of 2.3 million people a year. That is expected to slow to an annual rate of 1.9 million in the next few years. </TEXT></DOC>
