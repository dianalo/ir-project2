Parties once closely aligned with the Communists, includingimportant sectors of the Socialist Party, are taking pains todistance themselves from the pro-Moscow group while the countryprepares for an end to 15 years of right-wing military rule.   Many Socialists spent more than a decade in exile in WesternEurope after the 1973 military coup that brought Augusto Pinochet topower. Their political views were moderated by reforms in thatregion, where socialist groups shed their Leninist tendencies.   But most Chilean Communists sought refuge in the Soviet Union orEast Germany. Upon their return, they have employed a revolutionaryrhetoric that many ex-comrades find antiquated and offensive.   ``While Communism is changing around the world, the Chilean partygoes back to 1917 and declares itself pro-Bolshevik,'' Socialistex-senator Erich Schnake told The Associated Press. ``That leavesthem entrapped in a political-military apparatus.''   Schnake was referring to a recent Communist Party documentpresented at its first national congress in 19 years. In it, theparty declared: ``Our policy of open rebellion remains in effect.''   It was a reiteration of a party policy statement in 1983 thatformally proclaimed a strategy of ``popular rebellion'' and ``theuse of legitimate violence and all forms of struggle'' againstPinochet.   Schnake participated in a coalition of Socialists, Communists andother leftist groups led by Salvador Allende, who was electedpresident in 1970 and ousted by Pinochet.   He now calls the Communists ``one of the most difficult things toexplain in Chilean politics today.''   Jose Sanfuentes, a Communist Party spokesman, objected tocriticism of the Communists' militant stance but admits the strategyhad created some problems with the rest of the opposition.   ``But we do not feel isolated,'' he insisted. ``We are animportant element in the fight to restore democracy.''   The country's non-Marxist opposition led a peaceful cmpaign forPinochet's defeat in an Oct. 5 referendum, which asked voterswhether the 73-year-old army commander's rule should be extendeduntil 1997.   The Communist Party characterized the vote as a farce andinsisted only mass struggle would topple the government. Only afterit appeared evident Pinochet would lose, a few weeks before theelection, did the party come out in favor of a ``no'' vote.   The Communists were not invited to join thea broad-basedopposition coalition that led the campaign, and they remainostracized while the coalition prepares for open elections.   Socialist Ricardo Lagos, a leader of the coalition, characterizedthe Communists' position as ``contradictory.''   ``They need to clearly define themselves, to the whole country,''he said. ``The country can't understand a party that says it wantsto become legal and thinks that's compatible with a bunch of kidsattacking a police station.''   He referred to a recent attack on a rural police outpost in whichone officer was killed. A guerrilla band that claimed responsibilityis widely believed to be related to the Communist Party.   The government calls the group ``the armed hand of the CommunistParty.''   Sanfuentes denied his party encourages terrorism and claimedrecent terrorist actions were the work of government securityservices to put the blame on the Communists.   ``We do not want to exclude anybody,'' Lagos said. ``TheCommunists want to participate? Very well. Then, let them to adhereto our strategies.''   The Communist Party is officially outlawed and has sufferedfierce repression by the military since the coup. Party spokesmensay 17 members of its central committee and dozens of other partymilitants have been killed during military rule.   Some political analysts contend the repression has contributed tothe party's resistance to reform, by forcing it to functionclandestinely.   The party convention, expected to last several months, began inDecember but was being held secretly for fear of governmentsanctions, spokesmen said.   Some party ``public spokesmen,'' such as Sanfuentes, haveoperated more or less openly, however, appearing at public eventsand meeting with the news media.   ``Popular mobilization is still essential to put an end to thedictatorship,'' Sanfuentes said. The expression ``popularmobilization'' is used by Communists to describe labor strikes andstreet demonstrations.   Sanfuentes said his party is not immune to changes in communismaround the world, but he claimed that those changes, including``perestroika'' in the Soviet Union, have been misunderstood bynon-adherents.   ``They try to show `perestroika' as a reverse for the RussianRevolution,'' he said. ``That's not so. It's exactly the other wayaround. The idea is to rescue the best part of the revolution, tomake more democracy and more socialism.''   ``In that sense, our party is going through a process of renewalwhich is deeply revolutionary,'' Sanfuentes added. ``And thatprocess has not been prompted by events in other parts of the worldor in other parties, but by the reality in our own country.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for AMs Tuesday Jan. 10</NOTE></DOC>
