(product introduction).andO;Product:   SuperCard (Data base management system).andO;Topic:     Product IntroductionStackwareSoftware PackagesHypertext.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>A Wilder CardandM;HyperCard offers the essential power of the Mac in a tool with comfortablehandles -- cards, buttons, Fields, and paintings -- and to manage it all, aslick programming language that looks a lot like English.andP;  HyperCard is softand smart enough to coax card-based applications from the most unlikelyindividuals.andP;  But those cards are as confining as they are liberating.andM;HyperCard doesn't let you create genuine-looking Macintosh applications.andP;  Youcan't have your own menus, resizable windows, multiple open stacks, largepages, and objects that you can move around.andP;  Nor does it offer decentreports.andP;  However clever, valuable, and fun to program, HyperCard stacks aresecond-class software.andP;  They're placed in a subclass -- stackware (yuck!),andO;not real software, and stackware prices reflect just that.andM;It was both unlikely and inevitable that someone would develop a betterproduct than HyperCard.andP;  Unlikely because HyperCard is free, which is a toughprice to beat.andP;  Inevitable because the universe naturally responds tomounting pressures and to the outcries of nose-to-the-wall stack developers.andO;Poof!andP;  SuperCard appears out of nowhere.andP;  This special report is a preview ofits power, based on a week of hands-on internship at the offices of itsdeveloper, Silicon Beach Software.andM;HYPERHYPERCARDandM;SuperCard builds on HyperCard's capabilities, and the HyperTalk language, togive software authors practically full (and full-color) access to the powersand interface features of the Macintosh -- the proverbial &quot;all of the above.&quot;andO;Powerful as SuperCard is, it would be a mistake to dub it hastily thehigh-end or the color HyperCard.andP;  It can be just as tame as HyperCard, andcolor is not its only feature.andP;  It will run perfectly well on a Mac Plus oran SE.andM;Moreover, it's neither a HyperCard clone nor a direct competitor.andP;  SinceHyperCard comes with every Macintosh, we won't see a sudden drop in HyperCardsales.andP;  What's more likely to happen is a boost to Macintosh sales.andO;Potential developers who find HyperCard too restrictive can now embrace theMac and SuperCard's wide-open authoring environment.andP;  Current developers,already well-versed in HyperTalk, can now pull out all the stops and createsome awesome stuff.andM;WINDOWS, NOT PEEPHOLESandM;With SuperCard you can build applications that look and feel every bit likeany application you pay good money for.andP;  Both developers and users should beecstatic about that.andP;  Yes, there are cards, but these can be of any size --as big as billboards if you like.andP;  These cards can reside in any of the sevenwindow types that the Macintosh System supports, including scrolling windows,floating palettes, and dialog boxes.andP;  You can even change the type and sizeof windows on the fly, based on the size of the screen, for example, or thelongest line of text, or the location of other windows.andP;  There are optionsthat allow the user to zoom, resize, and drag a window, depending on itstype.andP;  You can have any mix of card and window sizes in one file.andM;Although each window can show only one card at a time, you can have anynumber of windows open.andP;  What's so hot about that?andP;  One window may holdclickable tools, another a document on which the tools may operate, while yetanother may contain reference information.andP;  If you're conducting research,you can browse in one window, then select items from that window and copythem to your collection window -- possibilities, possibilities.andM;PICTURE THISandM;SuperCard has a full-featured, full-color, object-oriented drawingenvironment for creating objects that can be reshaped, resized, restacked,and moved freely throughout the document.andP;  Its Paint mode draws on floatingeasels -- which are themselves objects, enabling you to reposition themeasily on a card and make them dance to scripted motion.andP;  Each graphic,imported or new, can have its own color palette.andP;  There are commands to drivespeed-controlled color cycling of a specific range of palette colors,providing another tool for conveying information.andP;  There are also tools forauto-tracing and gray-scale manipulation.andP;  SuperCard will import the samekind of plug-in tools that SuperPaint 2.0 accepts.andP;  What's more, it canimport PAINT, PICT, PICT2, TIFF and Encapsulated PostScript Format (EPSF)graphics files.andM;A MOVING SUBJECTandM;Because everything on a card is a floating object, it can be the subject ofanimation.andP;  SuperCard's Move command lets you relocate an object to aspecific place on a card, or shift it relative to its current position andspecify how many steps to take along the way.andP;  You can instruct any object tomove along the points of any polygon or free-hand object, visible orinvisible.andP;  That's fancy animation with minimal scripting.andP;  Future releasesof SuperCard look to be far more sophisticated.andP;  You can record youranimation as a PICS file, which is a multiframe format that can be playedback by SuperCard itself, by VideoWorks Professional, and by simple&quot;projector&quot; programs.andM;HOT BUTTONSandM;Of course, standard button types are available, with the addition of apolygon button, which can be of any size or shape.andP;  Any button can beassigned any font, color, or line thickness, and a shadow of variable offset,pattern, and intensity.andP;  You can even design your own button icons andcursors for pushing them.andP;  If you prefer, you can use anything as a button.andO;For the same object-oriented reasons, anything on a card -- includinggraphics -- can be used as a button, with a real script associated with it.andM;MENU CHOICESandM;You have full control of menu installation and removal, menu names, textstyles, what each menu item does, and whether a menu item is disabled or hasa Command-key equivalent.andP;  Your menus don't have to play second-banana tosome mandatory set, but if you have no menus of your own you can opt toinstall a supplied set that enables stack navigation and editing, savingsfiles, and the use of desk accessories.andP;  You can add to or subtract fromthose as you see fit, and you can change the menus even as your applicationis running.andM;DATABASE POWERandM;SuperCard lets you have any number of open stacks, and you can operate on anyitem of any open or closed stack without explicitly opening anything.andP;  Theopening and closing does occur, but it's handled transparently by SuperCarditself.andP;  SuperCard's multi-windowing windowing talent simplifies data entrywith the use of forms whose contents can be distributed among severaldatabases, not necessarily into the card that's initially receiving theinput.andP;  You can thus have a variety of entry-form cards for the same databaseor databases.andM;PRINTINGandM;SuperCard unshackles you from HyperCard's limited printing options and itslow-resolution bit-mapped graphics.andP;  You can now design layouts ofpractically any size.andP;  These layouts can contain graphics and data fromseveral databases, and take full advantage of LaserWriter-quality output.andP;  Inmany cases, SuperCard can serve perfectly well as a page-layout applicationwith automatic page numbering, table of contents, calculation, graphing, andanything else you can script.andM;MAKING APPLICATIONSandM;SuperCard can produce two kinds of applications -- those that must run in thepresence of SuperCard, and those that can stand alone, requiring nosupporting program to run.andP;  Stand-alones eliminate problems of compatibilitywith HyperCard, or even other versions of Supercard.andP;  You'll be able toproduce a stand-alone program with its own custom icon and passwordprotection so that users can't modify it, ensuring both its integrity and itsvalue.andP;  Silicon Beach requires no license fees for the stand-aloneapplications you distribute.andP;  Users of stand-alone applications don't evenneed to own a copy of SuperCard.andM;The SuperCard package actually has two parts -- SuperEdit for creating andfully editing an application, and Supercard for running non-stand-alones.andO;SuperEdit can open multiple SuperCard applications so you can copy and pastecomponents among them.andP;  Components can be entire menu sets, windows (andassociated cards), scripts, and resources.andP;  For editing card objects, there'sa selection tool for each object type and a universal tool that can selectand operate on multiple objects of mixed types, even if some are on theforeground and some are on the background.andP;  Additional welcome features arethe alignment tool to help card designs look neater, and the ability to groupgraphic objects and use a single script to control every member of the group.andM;SuperEdit can also import resources from HyperCard stacks, SuperCardapplications, and other Macintosh applications.andP;  These include tool palettes,menus, icons, cursors, XCMDs, XFCNs, Sounds, and color lookup tables.andO;Imported menus and tool palettes from non-SuperCard applications won't carrytheir programming with them -- you'll need to develop your own scripts forthem.andP;  SuperEdit can also import a HyperCard stack and output a SuperCardstack of the same initial functionality.andP;  This conversion doesn't affect theoriginal stack.andP;  All SuperEdit can't do is execute scripts.andM;RUNNING, MANandM;SuperCard, the runner, does all the executing, but it's been wisely empoweredwith the ability to create and edit scripts, graphics, fields, buttons,cards, and windows.andP;  Except for offering script access when an error occurs,the runner has not built-in editing interface -- that must be scripted.andO;Luckily, Silicon Beach has already done it for you.andM;A script set can be automatically activated when you run any stack.andP;  It givesyou HyperCard-like menus, tool palattes, a message box, and a hefty subset ofSuperEdit's punch.andP;  If this sounds a little roundabout, consider that you canmodify that soft-editing environment to work any way you like, developing orbuying a new one, or customizing it according to your needs and removing itpartially or completely when you want to protect your application from alienattack.andM;THE &quot;C&quot; WORDandM;On the surface, concerns of compatibility with HyperCard stackware seemwell-founded, but they quickly vanish.andP;  First, you need only to convert aHyperCard stack to a SuperCard stack if you want to increase itsfunctionality.andP;  Second, Silicon Beach assures us that SuperCard will stayabreast of HyperCard developments, maintaining the ability to importHyperCard stacks.andP;  Third, even if compatibility is incomplete, severalperfectly viable alternatives exist.andP;  The obvious option is to continue usingHyperCard.andP;  Another alternative is to convert stacks to SuperCard and makeany necessary one-time adjustments.andP;  The final route is to duplicate andimprove the functionality of a HyperCard stack in a spanking-new SuperCardstack.andP;  As for the other direction, SuperCard's language extensions, highercapabilities, and file formats preclude it from exporting its stacks toHyperCard.andP;  But why bother?andM;WHAT SUPERCARD MEANS TO YOUandM;If you're strictly a user, you'll benefit from this new hyperware that doesfar more, without using goofy work-ardounds, to compensate for a limitedinterface.andP;  If you're an occasional scripter, you'll find that familiarHyperTalk statements have gained numerous well-integrated SuperCardextensions, and every script window has pop-up menus containing the entireSuperTalk language.andP;  You can start with one-window/one-card applications andgrow from there in the privacy of your own cerebrum.andP;  You experiencedscripters, who have already bumped hard against the limitations of HyperCard,can now dispense with the mental wish lists and dust off those shelvedproject ideas.andM;Developers of HyperCard accessories, like reference stacks, canned scripts,external commands, and report generators, need not worry.andP;  The potential forSupercard development is vast.andP;  There is always a market for software withtrue utility and a clear, appropriate interface.andP;  Not everyone can achievethat, but those who can will have the ideal tool to make and market realsoftware.andP;  Experts in any field will be able to share their expertise andpresent their knowledge in practically any form and sequence they choose --without becoming programming hermits.andP;  The educational possibilities areimmense.andM;Supercard should ship in the second quarter of 1989, and will sell for lessthan $ 200 -- a small price for such a talented artist and capable servant.andO;After all, it even does windows.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
