<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-03-0009 </DOCNO><TEXT>As introduced, H.R. 2806 was very general and sweeping. It would haveamended FLPMA so as the create a new category of authorization whichthe Secretary of the Interior could issue regarding use of BLM-managedpublic lands (anywhere in the Nation) by other Federal departments andagencies (not just Defense). This new category would have consisted ofnonrenewable authorizations for temporary land use having a maximum termof three years. The bill as introduced did not specify any further restrictionsas to how such authorizations could be used by the recipient agency.Because of the complexity of the issues raised by such general legislation,and because introduction of the bill was prompted by the Army's particularrequest with respect to public lands in Alaska, the committee rewrotethe bill through adoption of an amendment in the nature of a substitute.Its provisions are discussed in detail here in general, its effect isto confine the scope of the bill so that it would apply only to certainpublic lands in Alaska and only insofar as they might be made availablefor specified temporary uses by a military department or the Coast Guard.</TEXT></DOC>
