Mott's, which owns 18 Shop-Rite supermarkets in Connecticut and Massachusetts, agreed in February to sell its stores to Elizabeth, N.J.-based Wakefern, which owns ShopRite Supermarkets Inc. and operates stores in New Jersey.    Mott's said it decided to leave the supermarket industry because it didn't &quot;have the resources to compete.&quot; The company will continue to own and operate two retail liquor stores and to hold interests in several shopping centers. These businesses accounted for about 1% of the company's sales last year of $290.6 million.    Mott's is exploring options for redeploying assets, including liquidating the company.    Sale of three of the 18 supermarkets is subject to landlord approval. The purchase price for the remaining 15 stores will be reduced by $3.9 million, plus the value of the stores' inventory, if Mott's fails to get clearance.    In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Mott's closed at $12.50 a share, unchanged. </TEXT></DOC>
