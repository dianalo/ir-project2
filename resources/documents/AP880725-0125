Reagan did not elaborate, but an administration official notedearlier in the day that the United States had sent a new message toIran last week asking about the possibility of talks aimed atnormalizing relations. Tehran still has not sent an ``authorized''reply, the official said.   The official, who asked not be identified, said the UnitedStates would like to talk to the Iranians about ending the PersianGulf war, the nine Americans held hostage in Lebanon, andterrorism. But he said the U.S. message did not specify conditionsfor a resumption of relations, severed in 1980.   As he was leaving a White House Rose Garden ceremony honoringparticipants in the American Legion's Boys Nation program, Reaganwas asked, ``are you ready to talk to Iran about the hostages. Isit time?''   ``If they're willing and ready to talk, it's time,'' he replied.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said ``there's reallynothing new'' on the fate of the Americans held captive in Lebanonby pro-Iranian extremists.   But Fitzwater reiterated that in the wake of Iran's acceptanceof a U.N. Security Council resolution calling for a cease-fire inthe protracted Iran-Iraq war, American officials have been hopefulthat a dialogue could be established with the government ofrevolutionary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.   On Sunday, Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci said improvedU.S.-Iranian relations could lead to the release of the nineAmericans, including The AP's Middle East correspondent, TerryAnderson, who has been held since March 16, 1985, longer than anyother American.   ``We have consistently said that we're prepared to enter into adialogue with Iran,'' Carlucci said. ``All they have to do isdesignate somebody who is officially empowered to talk to us andwe'd be glad to talk with them about policy issues, aboutterrorism, about bringing peace to the region, about whatever isappropriate.''   Asked about speculation the U.S. hostages might be released ifthe war ends, Carlucci said, ``We're obviously not going to discussany quid pro quo, but if the Irnians want to talk to us about thehostage situation and how they're going to go about influencingtheir release, we'd be delighted to talk to them about it. I'm notin the slightest suggesting that there would be any deal for thehostages. That is contrary to our policy,''   Fitzwater took the same stand in answering reporters' questionsMonday.   ``Our position remains the same, that we're always available totalk any time any place about the safety or the release of thehostages but we will not negotiate for them and we don't anticipateany negotiations,'' he said.   ``We won't negotiate. We won't pay ransom. We won't talk quidpro quos. We won't give or take,'' he said. ``The answer to releaseof the hostages is to release them. ... It's not a complex matter.... They took them off the streets. They can put them back on thestreets.''   Reagan has persistently denied that his approval of theclandestine sales of U.S. arms to Iran in 1985 and 1986 amounted toan arms-for-hostages deal. But a presidential commission headed byformer Sen. John Tower, R-Texas, concluded there was such alinkage, and so did Congress.   Two hostages, the Rev. Benjamin Weir and David Jacobsen, werereleased during the time of the transfers of U.S. arms to Iran,which led to the subsequent diversion of sales proceeds toNicaraguan rebels and _ eventually _ the Reagan administration'sworst scandal.</TEXT></DOC>
