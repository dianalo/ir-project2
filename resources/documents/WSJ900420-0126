Although charges flew, neither emerged as a clear winnerin the battle to lead the maker of Sunbeam and Osterappliances out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy.</LP><TEXT>   Allegheny's reorganization plan calls for the majority ofits creditors to be paid in stock, while Japonica's plan tobuy Allegheny for $655 million would reimburse creditors incash.   Allegheny said Japonica bought enough bank claims inrecent weeks to make it the company's largest creditor andthen used its position to vote against the company's plan.Allegheny attorneys argued yesterday that Japonica wasn'tacting in good faith as a creditor but only to scuttle thecompany plan and further its own.   The company said, for example, that Japonica beganacquiring bank claims only after it decided to propose itsown plan and that it paid a premium to get the claimscritical to give it a blocking position.   In an interesting twist, Japonica said that Donaldson,Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp., which tried to buyAllegheny three times in the last two years, has returned andis now involved in buying bank claims. Japonica produced aletter from DLJ to Allegheny's secured banks saying that DLJ&quot;clients&quot; were interested in buying their claims outright aslong as enough were sold to create a blocking stake.   Japonica charged that DLJ is tied to Allegheny management,and that the DLJ acquired stake would be used to vote againstthe Japonica plan. Japonica said that Allegheny tapped JamesD. Milligan to head its new management team and that Mr.Milligan worked closely with DLJ. In fact, he was DLJ'schoice for Allegheny's chief executive officer when DLJ wascourting the company.   Meanwhile, the company's banks and unsecured creditorsstrongly urged the court to nullify Japonica's vote againstthe company plan. They argued that Japonica, by blocking thecompany plan to further its own, is trying to hold themhostage to the Japonica plan.</TEXT></DOC>
