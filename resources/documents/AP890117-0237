Reynolds Charges AMA With Trying To Further Political Goals</HEAD><TEXT>   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) _ R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. claims thatan article in the Journal of the American Medical Association is anattempt by AMA officials to further their political goal of banningthe company's new ``smokeless'' cigarette.   ``We are appalled that such a widely respected publication asJAMA would jeopardize its reputation by promoting distortions tofurther the political goals of its parent organization,'' G. RobertDi Marco, Reynolds Tobacco's senior vice president of research anddevelopment, said in a registered letter Monday to JAMA.   RJR charged that a political faction of the AMA has printedinformation in the Jan. 6 issue about Premier, which heats ratherthan burns tobacco. The company said the information isscientifically incorrect.   ``No scientific journal, no matter how widely read or wellregarded, can afford to dilute or distort scientific facts, muchless publish information that they ought to know is scientificallyincorrect,'' Di Marco said.   A spokesman for AMA in Chicago could not be reached at home lateMonday night.   A letter to the editor of JAMA reported preliminary results fromtwo government scientists at the National Institute of Drug Abuse inBaltimore, which claims that Premier could be altered to smoke crackcocaine.   Di Marco said RJR scientists met with top AMA officials in Juneand presented an overview of the scientific testing conducted onPremier.   ``Despite our initial invitations to visit our laboratories andtalk to our scientists, to date the AMA has not accepted our offerto learn detailed facts about the science surrounding Premier, nordid they contact us in regard to their most recent statements,'' DiMarco said.   ``This leads me to believe that the real issue here isprohibition,'' he added.</TEXT></DOC>
