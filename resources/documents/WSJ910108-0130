Quits   Software Segment,   Sets Large Charge   ----   By Jim Carlton   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>01/08/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B4</SO><CO>   COMS MSFT NOVL</CO><IN>COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (CPR)SOFTWARE (SOF)</IN><LP>   3Com Corp. said it was withdrawing from the networkoperating system software business, laying off 12% of itswork force, and taking a $45 million charge that will lead toa fiscal third-quarter loss.   The Santa Clara, Calif., concern said it would return toits hardware roots by refocusing attention on its coreproduct lines: network adapters, network hubs andinternetworking.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;A tight focus on our core product lines . . . will allowus to respond better to customers, maximize profitability andachieve leadership in global data networking,&quot; said EricBenhamou, 3Com's president and chief executive officer.   In a separate announcement, 3Com indicated it waslicensing its network operating systems software to MicrosoftCorp. for integration into Microsoft's future versions of itsLan Manager product line.   Following the announcements, over-the-counter quotes in3Com were halted with the stock at $7.75, down 12.5 cents.   Analysts said 3Com was weakened by competing againstNovell Inc., of Provo, Utah, in the computer network systemsmarket. 3Com tried to market its own software against Novell,and then offered Microsoft's Lan Manager program. Bothefforts failed in 3Com's bid to unseat Novell's NetWaresystem from a position of dominance.   The only surprise about yesterday's announcement was themagnitude of the onetime charge, said Richard H. Kimball,managing director of Montgomery Securities.   The charge, 3Com officials said, would be taken in thefiscal third quarter ending Feb. 28. Since 3Com had beenexpected to show a profit of between $3.4 million and $5.2million for the quarter, the charge will result in a loss ofabout $40 million, or $1.50 a share, Mr. Kimball calculated.The company's retrenching includes reduction of its1,953-person work force by 12%, or about 235 peopleworld-wide.   3Com erred, Mr. Kimball said, by plunging headlong intonetworking systems, while failing to capitalize on taking anearly position in inter-networking and the intelligent hubmarketplace, two sectors with high growth potential.   But analysts noted that 3Com's balance sheet generally isin sound shape, with the company having little debt.   &quot;It's like the shirt you got ink on the pocket two weeksago and finally you have to throw it away. That's all itamounts to,&quot; said William P. O'Connor Jr. of FourteenResearch in New York.</TEXT></DOC>
