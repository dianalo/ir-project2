RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld a keycivil rights law as a weapon against private discrmination butbarred its use to fight racial harassment such as assignment tomenial tasks on the job.   Civil rights groups, finding little solace that a larger defeatwas avoided, expressed outrage and called the ruling the fourthmajor setback the court has dealt minorities and women this year.   A newly solidifed conservative majority led by appointees offormer President Reagan is undoing civil rights progress that beganin the mid-1950s, the groups said.   ``This Supreme Court term has been a disaster for all thosecommitted to equal employment opportunity,'' said Bejamin Hooks andRalph Neas of the Leadership Conference of Civil Rights.   ``In several rulings ..., a slim majority of the court has turnedback the clock on advances which so many worked long and hard toachieve,'' said Marcia Greenberger of the National Women's LawCenter.   The court unanimously voted to reaffim its 1976 ruling that an1866 law enacted to help freed slaves could be used to sue privatecitizens accused of illegal racial bias.   By a separate 5-4 vote, the justices ruled that the 123-year-oldlaw cannot be invoked to fight racial harassment.   There was considerable irony in the two-part ruling.   The justices sparked an uproar in the civil rights community lastyear by announcing they would use the relatively obscure case of ablack North Carolina bank teller to consider throwing out the 1976ruling.   Some of the outrage was muted Thursday when the court retreatedfrom that threat. But civil rights activists angrily noted thatThursday's decision came on the heels of three major defeats forminority and women's rights.   ``It's a sad commentary on the state of the court's generaloutlook on civil rights that today's decision must be greeted with ameasure of relief,'' said John Buchanan of the liberal People forthe American Way.   Last January, the court banned racial quotas in the awarding ofpublic works project by state and local governments.   On June 5, the justices restricted the use of statisticalevidence to prove an employer illegally relegates minorities orwomen to lower-paying jobs.   And just last Monday, the court significantly expanded the powerof white men to challenge court-approved affirmative action plans,even years after those plans took effect.   Writing for the court Thursday, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy saidthat concern for precedent compelled a reaffirmation of the 1976ruling.   Even if that ruling was based on a mistaken interpretation oflaw, he said, ``It is certain that it is not inconsistent with theprevailing sense of justice in this country. To the contrary, (it)is entirely consistent with our society's deep commitment to theeradication of discrimination based on a person's race or the colorof his or her skin.''   But Kennedy said allowing suits for racial harassment was notenvisioned by the 1866 law.   That spelled defeat for Brenda Patterson, a North Carolina womanwho was a teller at a credit union. She sued under the 1866 law,seeking actual and punitive damages for alleged harassment.   Her assignment to sweep floors, she said, constitutedimpermissible racial harassment.   Her suit had been dismissed by lower courts.   Kennedy said the 1866 law governs contractual rights _ such ashiring and promotion decisions _ and not other forms of conduct byan employer, such as assignments to tasks like sweeping floors.   A victim of racial harassment still could sue under the 1964Civil Rights Act or various state laws. The 1964 act does not allowthe recovery of punitive damages, while the 1866 act does. Also, the1866 act applies to all employers, while the 1964 statute exemptsemployers of 15 or fewer people, about 15 percent of the work force.   Justice William J. Brennan, in a dissenting opinion, said, ``Whatthe court declines to snatch away with one hand, it takes with theother.''   He said the ruling severely weakens the 1866 law by ``ignoringpowerful historic evidence about the Reconstruction Congress'concerns'' about ending racial bias.   Joining Brennan were Justices Thurgood Marshall, Harry A.Blackmun and John Paul Stevens.   Joining Kennedy in limiting the 1866 law were Chief JusticeWilliam H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, AntoninScalia and Byron R. White.   Kennedy, O'Connor and Scalia are Reagan appointees; Rehnquist waspromoted to chief justice by the former president. White had beenappointed by former President John F. Kennedy.   The court's 1976 decision at issue in the case is called Runyonvs. McCrary. It held that racially segregated private schools thatrefuse to admit blacks violate the 1866 law.   That ruling allowed civil rights groups to use the 1866 law as aweapon to attack private discrimination in all forms, and allowsthose who sue to collect much larger damages than other civil rightslaws.   The attorneys general of nearly every state, a majority of U.S.senators, more than 100 House members and more than 100 civil rightsand public interest groups had urged the court not to tamper withits 1976 ruling.   In a separate decision Thursday, the court said states and stateofficials may not be sued under a related 1871 law that protectscivil liberties. The 5-4 ruling in a case from Michigan said statesand their officials are not ``persons'' as envisioned by the 1871law.   In other rulings, the court:   _Gave some legal help to any man who, saying he is the biologicalfather, seeks visitation rights to the child of a woman married tosomeone else.   Voting 5-4 in a California case, the justices said states mustgive such men a ``fair opportunity'' to seek visitation rights.   _Ruled, by a 5-4 vote in a Pennsylvania case, that states may beforced through private lawsuits to help pay for cleaning uphazardous waste sites targeted under the so-called federal SuperfundAct.   _Shielded states from federal court lawsuits by parents seekingto enforce a federal law aimed at assuring adequate education forhandicapped children. The court, 5-4, spared Pennsylvania frompaying a year's private school tuition for a student with a learningdisability.</TEXT></DOC>
