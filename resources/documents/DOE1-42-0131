The breakdown was 45% for main surface fans, 24% forunderground booster fans and 31% for auxiliary ventilation. There aremany mines with power costs in excess of half a million ponds a yearand it is apparent that any significant saving can make a marked contributionto the mining of coal at competitive prices. This article is intendedto question the philososphy of traditional ventilation planning and suggestways by which mines may be ventilated more efficiently and at greatlyreduced costs.</TEXT></DOC>
