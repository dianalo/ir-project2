Applications of current systems include generation of picosecondx-ray pulses, investigation of possible x-ray laser pumping schemes,studies of multiphoton phenomena in atomic species, and time-resolvedphotochemistry. These systems, based on the amplification of subpicosecondpulses in small aperture ({approximately}1 cm{sup 2}) XeCl or KrF amplifiers,deliver focal spot intensities of {approximately}10{sup 17} W/cm{sup2}. Scaling to higher intensities, however, will require an additionallarge aperture amplifier which preserves near-diffraction-limited beamquality and subpicosecond pulse duration. We describe here both a smallaperture KrF system which routinely provides intensities andgt;10{sup 17}W/cm{sup 2} to several experiments, and a large aperture XeCl systemdesigned to deliver {approximately}1 J subpicosecond pulses and yieldintensities on target in excess of 10{sup 19}W/cm{sup 2}. We also discussthe effects of two-photon absorption on large-aperture, high-brightnessexcimer lasers. 4 refs., 2 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
