The typical rate for a 10-year loan on existing properties was 9% to 9.25% -- slightly higher than in February but about the same as in January.    Lenders remain flush with cash but report weak demand for loans on properties that meet their lending standards. One of the largest lenders says its commercial mortgage volume is about half what it was a year ago. Citicorp Real Estate's survey indicates that there are plenty of buyers for quality properties but few sellers largely due to the wave of tax-motivated selling at the end of last year.    Lenders say the recent upturn in interest rates on bonds could bring into the market some owners waiting to refinance properties. James Richmond Jr., president of Aetna Realty Investors Inc., says, &quot;For April, we just can't tell yet. With this latest kick in the prime rate, maybe we'll see a flurry of activity. But even with the recent 0.25% increase in short-term rates, it costs a builder more to get permanent financing than to remain on their construction loans. They're in no hurry to do that. The banks -- more than I've ever seen them do this -- are offering borrowers inducements to stay with the bank's construction loans.&quot;    An executive at a large credit company says, &quot;It's too early to tell what the prime rate increase will do to commercial mortgage volume. Everyone rushed to do deals at year's end, and there just are not as many properties changing hands.&quot;    Other rates reported in Citicorp's March survey are: For existing properties, the typical rate on five-year loans is 8.25% to 8.5%; the typical rate was 9.62% for 15-year loans.    Despite the low levels of demand, few lenders are bending their underwriting criteria to make loans. Citicorp's survey indicates few life insurance companies will lend more than 75% of a project's value, and most are requiring the properties generate $1.20 of income for every $1 of debt.    Citicorp Real Estate's monthly survey is based on reports by 13 life insurance companies, one thrift, one fund adviser, one credit company, one bank, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. and the Federal National Mortgage Association. </TEXT></DOC>
