Passage of the resolution approving the treaty, which could come as early as today, would allow President Reagan to present Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev with the ratified document during their talks in Moscow next week, completing the president's most-cherished foreign policy achievement.    White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker, who remained here when Mr. Reagan and his entourage left Wednesday on the first leg of their trip, plans to deliver the treaty to the president.    One of the last remaining issues was resolved when lawmakers voted 72-27 to prevent future presidents from being able to reinterpret the treaty's provisions without the Senate's consent. The question of reinterpreting arms treaties has been much disputed since 1985, when the Reagan administration adopted a new reading of the 1972 pact limiting anti-ballistic missile weapons that would allow testing for the proposed strategic defense initiative.    Last night, the senators wrangled over language refining the resolution and final attempts to attach political statements to it.    In eight days of Senate debate, a band of conservative Republicans led by Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina could muster no more than 28 votes in their attempts to derail the treaty.    Those lawmakers complained that the elimination of medium-range nuclear weapons would put U.S. allies in Europe at a disadvantage because of the Soviet Union's numerical superiority there in conventional arms. They also wanted to slow progress toward the president's far more ambitious goal of negotiating a 50% cut in strategic arms.    The treaty, which Messrs. Reagan and Gorbachev signed Dec. 8 during their summit meeting here, is the first to require the destruction of nuclear weapons, rather than simply slow the growth in arsenals.    It calls for the elimination within three years of 830 U.S. and 1,752 Soviet missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500 kilometers, or between 310 and 3,410 miles. The Soviets would have to retire more warheads than the U.S. because many of the Soviet missiles each carry three payloads, while all of the U.S. missiles have only one warhead each.    To ensure that both sides live up to their commitments, the treaty provides for the most ambitious verification arrangements in history. Over a period of 13 years, the U.S. and Soviet Union would station inspection teams on each other's soil to make sure neither side secretly produces missiles banned by the agreement.    A special verification commission is to referee disputes. Unlike the current Standing Consultative Commission, which critics charge has been powerless to correct violations of past arms treaties, the new panel could be convened on short notice, instead of at scheduled intervals. </TEXT></DOC>
