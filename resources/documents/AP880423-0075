Fred Hardin, president of the 88,000-member UnitedTransportation Union, said in an interview he is launching aneffort to take over the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers ``withor without its consent.''   Larry McFather, president of the 28,000-member BLE, accusedHardin of ``engaging in an outright raiding campaign against ourunion'' and vowed an appropriate response that might includeabandoning the UTU to its own devices at the bargaining table.   The Locomotive Engineers, whose members are the highest paidamong unionized rail workers, last week voted to affiliate with theAFL-CIO, breaking a 125-year tradition of staying aloof from suchalliances.   ``The BLE has gone into a cave of protection,'' said Hardin, whopulled his own union out of the AFL-CIO two years ago when thelabor federation was preparing sanctions against it for trying tosnare 2,000 Amtrak workers away from other unions.   The AFL-CIO's constitution prohibits its affiliated unions fromseeking to acquire the members of any other union allied with thefederation.   Hardin said he had approached McFather and his two predecessorsabout absorbing the engineers into his union through what he called``an honorable affiliation'' that would allow it to exerciseautonomy.   ``We can't continue with 15 separate unions in an industry thatis merging and reorganizing every day and which has declined from amillion workers to just 300,000,'' Hardin said.   ``In as much as he (McFather) seems determined to remain aseparate union, we have no alternative but to give the workingengineers, through a representation election, the right to effect amerger,'' he said.   Industry negotiators have vowed to reduce the carriers'unionized labor force by 25 percent, or 60,000 to 75,000 workers,over the next three years, largely by reducing the size of traincrews who, except for locomotive engineers, mostly belong to theUTU.   To accomplish that with as little labor unrest as possible, onecarrier, CSX Rail Transport, the nation's largest, is offeringseverance payments of $50,000 to $75,000 for each departing worker.   And in the first example of so-called ``gain sharing'' with railunions, CSX also is offering to split 50-50 with the remainingworkers the $475 million it will save from the job cuts.   The layoffs would be accomplished by changing the current workrules between the unions and the railroads, which now require twobrakemen, a conductor and an engineer on every train.   Most rail labor leaders are hoping that whatever agreement isstruck with CSX will set the pattern for the rest of the industry.   While other unions are reluctantly yielding to the employmentreductions in exchange for a share of the savings, the UTU has beenthe most resistant to the idea, largely because its members wouldlose the most jobs.   ``The UTU is not about to make any agreement with CSX that wouldeliminate 9,000 UTU positions out of 10,000 altogether and thendivide the money among all the remaining employees,'' he said. ``Wedon't mind dividing the apple, but we want it divided evenly.''   McFather called Hardin ``a desperate union president motivatedby his own perception that the UTU membership will decline over thenext few years as two- and three-man crews become predominant.''   ``In many cases, we have been standing side by side with the UTUand not agreeing with the carriers on the crew issues,'' McFathersaid. ``If Mr. Hardin is going to raid our union, we may be morereceptive to negotiating agreements.''   Ironically, both officials agreed their dispute is only going tohurt their bargaining position with the railroads.   Hardin said the railroads are sure to ``capitalize on anyfriction and discord among the unions.''   ``This is not the time to be fighting this kind of war,''McFather said. ``Anytime the carriers can keep our organizationspitted against each other, they always come out better off.''</TEXT></DOC>
