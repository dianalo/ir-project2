In a letter to the chairmen of the House and Senate armedservices committees and other key legislators, the experts said theplant is not needed for national security and would undermine U.S.efforts to limit the spread of nuclear arms.   The Bush administration is seeking authorization to beginbuilding a Special Isotope Separation Plant at the Idaho NationalEngineering Laboratory, near Idaho Falls. The plant would use a newlaser technology to convert fuel-grade plutonium from EnergyDepartment stockpiles to weapon-grade plutonium.   The letter, dated May 26, was signed by Paul Leventhal,president of the Nuclear Control Institute, a private groupconcerned with nuclear proliferation problems.   Among other signers were retired Adm. Thomas Davies, a formerassistant director of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency;Peter Bradford, a former member of the Nuclear RegulatoryCommission, and Peter Clausen, research director for the Union ofConcerned Scientists and a former CIA and Energy Department analyst.   The group said it was concerned that the technology could spreadto other nations that could convert fuel-grade plutonium fromcivilian plants to develop a nuclear arsenal. It also expressedconcern that the U.S. plant eventually could be used to purifyplutonium from U.S. commercial nuclear reactors, even though thisis specifically outlawed by the 1982 Atomic Energy Act.   ``For both these reasons, going forward with the SIS plant couldseverely compromise U.S. non-proliferation objectives,'' the lettersaid.   ``In view of the acknowledged surplus of plutonium in the U.S.nuclear arsenal, there are no clear national security benefits thatoffset the obvious nuclear proliferation and terrorism risks ...''posed by use of the plant, they added.   The isotope separation technology is still under development atan Energy Department laboratory in California, although theadministration wants to break ground on the Idaho plant this year.</TEXT></DOC>
