As for the present automated systems, the progressof automated systems is described, and the distribution control systemto control line switches on distribution lines and to monitor the informationof distributing substations is outlined. The distribution system diagramdisplay function, optimal system switching function at time of accidentsor maintenance works, and data maintenance function of the computer systemfor the automated system are described, and in addition, the communicationnetwork, transmission control procedures and system functions of thedistribution line remote control system are described. As future subjects,the coordination between the automated system and customer services suchas centralized load control, automatic meter reading and informationservice, and the multipurpose use of new media are outlined.
