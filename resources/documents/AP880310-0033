In another development, Solidarity leader Lech Walesa criticizedpolice for using force to break up student demonstrations in Warsawand Krakow.   About 50 supporters of the opposition group Orange Alternative,some carrying a banner reading ``Missiles _ no, sanitary pads _yes,'' handed out cotton pads to women in Wroclaw on Tuesday, saidJacek Kuron, a Warsaw opposition activist. Feminine hygieneproducts are in short supply in Poland and Tuesday wasInternational Women's Day.   Police moved in quickly and halted the demonstration in thesouthwestern city, arresting Orange Alternative leader WaldemarFrydrych, 34, and five other people, said Kuron.   On Wednesday, Frydrych was sentenced to two months in prison ona charge of causing public unrest. The action marked one of the fewtimes since a September 1986 amnesty for political prisoners that alower court has sentenced someone to prison for a politicallymotivated offense.   In almost all cases, people were held up to 48 hours andreleased after being fined.   Kuron said two other Orange Alternative supporters were eachfined the equivalent of $80.   He said the Orange Alternative members joked with the court byarguing that Karl Marx, the founder of communism, was actually abearded lady.   Frydrych has been detained at least half a dozen times sinceSeptember for organizing various Orange Alternative ``happenings''in Wroclaw in which demonstrators have dressed up as Santa Claus,Lenten penitents and even secret policemen to satirize governmentpolicies.   Walesa's comment on Wednesday came one day after club-wieldingriot police clashed with youths demonstrating for more academicfreedom on the 20th anniversary of student protests againstcensorship and political repression.   On Tuesday, police charged into hundreds of demonstrators inWarsaw and Krakow. The government said 83 people were arrested andall but 15 had been released.   The students were calling for restoration of academic freedomswon during the 1980-81 Solidarity labor upheaval and forlegalization of the Independent Students Union.</TEXT></DOC>
