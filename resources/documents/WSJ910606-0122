The assistant Texas attorney general has gained a nationalreputation for challenging the product claims of hugecorporations through lawsuits or threatened suits. He haswielded that weapon against such giants as Nestle S.A.,General Mills Inc., Mobil Corp., Quaker Oats Co., KelloggCo., Pfizer Inc. and, recently, General Motors Corp.,typically challenging the companies' claims about the healthbenefits of their products or other allegedly misleadingadvertising claims.</LP><TEXT>   But much to the chagrin of his targets, the 39-year-oldMr. Gardner has wielded another, more controversial weapon:media quotability. Earlier this week, Mr. Gardneracknowledged he was investigating claims that mayonnaise madeby Kraft General Foods Inc. is fat-free. &quot;It's not fat-free,&quot;he says. &quot;It is truth-free.&quot;   (A spokesman for Kraft, a unit of Philip Morris Cos., sayscompany representatives have discussed the claims with Mr.Gardner &quot;but weren't aware it was a formal investigation.&quot;The spokesman adds that &quot;flippant remarks make good copy, butit takes more than that to make good policy. The truth is,Kraft Free {mayonnaise} fully complies with the Food and DrugAdministration's current view of what a fat-free productis.&quot;)   And consider his comment on Quaker Oats' claim thatoatmeal can help reduce the risk of heart disease: &quot;If youhave cholesterol problems, you don't see Quaker,&quot; he said.&quot;You see your doctor.&quot; Quaker withdrew the claim withoutadmitting it violated any laws.   Most of Mr. Gardner's targets do the same, preferring theexpensive process of changing product labels and ad campaignsto seeing their names dragged through the media mud. But feware happy about the confrontation, or the way the aggressiveMr. Gardner goes about his campaigns. Two companies have nowturned Mr. Gardner's main weapon against him, filing lawsuitsagainst the litigator.   &quot;He is the definition of a loose cannon on a ship,&quot; saysFrederick P. Furth, chief counsel for Kellogg, which recentlyfiled a slander suit against Mr. Gardner after he was quotedas saying the cereal company &quot;constantly lies about itsproducts.&quot; Mr. Furth complains that &quot;the prosecutor's job isto ferret out the facts and represent all citizens. Mr.Gardner convicts everybody in the press. Is that what a goodattorney general is supposed to do?&quot;   Tele-Communications Inc. wonders the same thing. The cableoperator filed slander complaints against Mr. Gardner lastweek as part of its efforts to block a suit accusing it ofdeceptive business practices.   Other attorneys general and consumer advocates don't denythat Mr. Gardner gets an unusual amount of media attention,especially for a non-elected state official. But they arequick to dispute Mr. Furth's contention that Mr. Gardnermakes inappropriate use of the media to club companies intosettling complaints.   &quot;The role of a public lawyer is to keep the publicinformed through the media of the cases and what's going onin those cases,&quot; says Peter Bienstock, who was chief of NewYork Attorney General Robert Abrams's consumer bureau duringthe two years Mr. Gardner worked there.   &quot;There is time for diplomacy,&quot; Mr. Bienstock says. &quot;Thenthere are times when being vocal is important for the caseyou're involved in and for the public.&quot;   Much of what irks Kellogg and other corporate adversariesof Mr. Gardner is that his actions aren't limited to Texas,thanks to a trend that began developing in the mid-1980s.That was when state attorneys general began banding togetherto bring simultaneous enforcement actions against companies,who found themselves suddenly fighting cases on severalfronts rather than dealing with a single state.   Mr. Gardner, a big proponent of multistate litigation,served as lead counsel for the 49 attorneys general who sueda Chrysler Corp. unit for disconnecting the odometers on carsthat were later sold to the public. Chrysler agreed to paythe car owners about $16 million in restitution.   Kellogg's dispute with Mr. Gardner arose from coordinatedinvestigations by six state attorneys general, includingTexas and Iowa. And the Texas attorney general's lawsuitagainst Tele-Communications, filed last week in statedistrict court in Dallas, followed similar suits in Floridaand Washington and related investigations in at least fourother states.   Companies confronted by these bands of attorneys generalcomplain that Mr. Gardner's bark is the loudest and his bitethe least discriminating. &quot;I have met in the last three weekswith probably 10 or 15 assistant attorneys general around thecountry,&quot; says Jerome Kashinski, an operations counsel forDenver-based Tele-Communications. &quot;There is nobody like SteveGardner.&quot;   Tele-Communications, the nation's largest cable operator,is under fire for its recent marketing of Encore, a moviechannel, under a so-called negative option: Cable subscriberswould get the channel free for one month, then would becharged for it unless they specifically request that it bestopped. Earlier this week, the company said it would offer&quot;an additional feature&quot; to allow customers to refuse Encoreby not paying for the channel on their July bills.   Mr. Gardner, himself a Tele-Communications subscriber, wasquoted in Texas newspapers as threatening a suit against thecompany at least a week before he actually filed one. Thecompany beat Mr. Gardner to the courthouse by a day, filingits own suit to stop the enforcement action in an Austinstate court. Both suits are pending while Mr. Gardnerassesses the company's plans to give customers another optionfor canceling Encore.   &quot;We don't have any problem when an attorney general callsup and says, `Hey, I want to make sure my consumers aren'tgetting ripped off,'&quot; says Mr. Kashinski. &quot;That'sprofessional to professional. No one has made the kind ofwild accusations Gardner has. He goes for the outrage.&quot;   Mr. Gardner insists that media coverage of his allegationsisn't part of his litigation strategy. He says he willprovide the same information to anyone who asks, whether it'sa consumer, a competing company or the local televisionstation.   Mr. Gardner has spent most of his 16-year legal career inTexas, and all of it as a public-interest lawyer, a path thatmay have been directed by his father, a longtime police chiefin the Dallas suburb of Highland Park. As for his consumerinterests, Mr. Gardner says, &quot;I've always said it was becausemy mother was scared by a banker while I was in the womb.&quot;   Mr. Gardner spent almost seven years as a staff attorneywith the Legal Aid Society of Central Texas, then becamechief students' attorney at the University of Texas, his almamater. In 1982, he left his native state for New York, wherehe spent two years in Attorney General Abrams's office. Hereturned to Texas in late 1984 to head the attorney general'sconsumer-protection office in Dallas.   Mr. Gardner attributes much of his philosophy aboutconsumer protection to his experience in New York. &quot;I'm aTexan with a New York spin,&quot; he says. &quot;I'm mean as hell andI'm not very nice.&quot;   Even some of Mr. Gardner's fans thought he was being toomean when he went after Quaker Oats in September 1989. Afterhe filed suit accusing the company of overstating the healthbenefits of oatmeal, Mr. Gardner says, his mail includedletters from consumers defending the company.   It was a lonesome time. Other state attorneys generaldeclined to join Texas in the challenge of Quaker, and therewere concerns about possible political fallout for thenAttorney General Jim Mattox, who had announced his plans torun for Texas governor.   &quot;When you take on God, motherhood, apple pie and Quaker,it's difficult not to be concerned,&quot; says Mr. Mattox, whosubsequently lost the race for governor.   &quot;I've given Steve a lot of blame for my political demisebecause of the enemies that we created,&quot; Mr. Mattox says.&quot;But he did exactly what I wanted him to do.&quot;   Mr. Gardner's new boss, Attorney General Dan Morales, tookoffice in January and shows every sign of backing thenoisiest of his 400 assistants. Last week, while anotherassistant attorney general was in Battle Creek, Mich.,arguing for a change of venue in Kellogg's slander suit, Mr.Gardner was in Texas giving an interview to this newspaperabout his intent to sue General Motors for the way it wastouting the Baldrige Quality award won by its Cadillacdivision.   &quot;Gardner has a national reputation now for being a veryaggressive consumer advocate, and he's got the go-ahead fromthe attorney general,&quot; said a spokesman for Mr. Morales. &quot;Hepretty much has free rein.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
