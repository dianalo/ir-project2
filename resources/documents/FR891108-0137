Population in Pulaski Countyis expected to increase by approximately 190,000 people between 1980 and2010 to a total population of approximately 530,000. Most of the growthis expected to occur in Sherwood, at the eastern end of the facility, Maumelleto the southwest, and northwest Little Rock further southwest. The proposedfacility will connect these three rapidly growing areas of the County acrossthe northwest part of the metropolitan area via I-40 and I-430. In addition,the proposed facility will provide an improved connection between the NationalGuard training facility at Camp Joseph T. Robinson and the Little RockAir Force Base at Jacksonville. Improved access to the North Little RockMunicipal Airport will also be provided. There are no east-west arterialsnorth of 47th/McCain across northern Pulaski County. The size of Camp Robinsonand the scarcity of undeveloped corridors across the area necessitate theprompt identification of the facility alignment so that right-of-way maybe preserved. Alternatives to be considered are: (1) The ``Do-Nothing'' Alternative whereroads are constructed according to the regional plan with the exceptionof the proposed facility; (2) the ``Reconstruction'' Alternative whereroads on the regional plan are upgraded to handle traffic forecast forthe proposed facility; (3) the ``Mass Transit'' Alternative; and (4) the``New Location'' Alternative considering several different alignments.Letters describing the proposed action and soliciting comments will besent to appropriate Federal, state, and local agencies and to private organizations,including conservation groups and groups and individuals who have voicedopposition to the project in the past and to major Arkansas newspapers.Also, a series of public involvement sessions have been held in a mobiletrainer situated directly in the areas to be affected. In addition, a publichearing will be held. Public notice will be given of the time and placeof the hearing. The draft EIS will be available for public and agency reviewand comment prior to the public hearing. A formal scoping meeting willbe held. To ensure that the full range of issues related to this proposed actionare addressed and all significant issues identified, comments and suggestionsare invited from all interested parties. Comments or questions concerningthis proposed action and the EIS should be directed to the FHWA at theaddress provided above.<ITAG tagnum="20">(Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program Number 20.205, HighwayPlanning and Construction.
