Putative endogenous digitalis-likefactors (DLF's) were studied in four in vitro assays for cardiac glycosides.[{sup 3}H]Etorphine binding was characterized in rat brain homogenates,depleted of opioids, from animals acutely and chronically treated withmorphine and naloxone, and either unstressed or cold-restraint-stressed.Binding sites for the ion channel modulators [{sup 3}H]verapamil ([{sup3}H]VER) and [{sup 3}H] phencyclidine ([{sup 3}H]PCP) were characterizedin rat brain.</TEXT></DOC>
