The Commerce Department said the performance of the grossnational product, the broadest measure of economic health, slowed inthe third quarter after growing at an annual rate of 3.0 percent inthe second quarter and 3.4 percent in the first three months of theyear.   It was the slowest pace since the fourth quarter of 1986, whenthe economy grew at a sluggish 1.4 percent rate.   However, the department said the picture was distorted by thesummer drought that hit much of the nation. Without the drought,growth would have been 3.9 percent in the second quarter and 3.2percent in the third quarter.   So far, a little less than half of the $12.8 billion in droughtlosses have been accounted for in the GNP. They are likely to shaveas much as 1.2 percent off the fourth quarter average.   ``If we hadn't had a drought where cows died and grain dried up,GNP would have been much stronger,'' said William Dunkelberg, deanof the school of business at Temple University in Philadelphia.``What that tells you is you have one hot economy on your hands.''   But higher prices accompanied the growth. The government said aprice index tied to the GNP, which is adjusted to exclude theeffects of changing buying patterns, rose at an annual rate of 5.1percent in the third quarter, edging up from 5.0 percent in thesecond quarter. It was the steepest increase in more than six years.   The growth figure and the price index represent revisions from anadvance estimate last month, when GNP was reported at a 2.2 percentrate and the price index at 4.9 percent.   In other economic developments:   _The Commerce Department reported that after-tax corporateprofits in the third quarter were nearly flat. They rose only 0.2percent to $163.1 billion, following an exceptionally large increaseof 8.9 percent a quarter earlier. It was corporate America's poorestperformance since a loss in the fourth quarter of 1987.   _The Agriculture Department predicted food prices would rise by 3percent to 5 percent next year, after rising about 4 percent thisyear. The forecast came from James R. Donald, chairman of thedepartment's World Agricultural Outlook Board.   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the latestGNP report does not change ``the basic economic picture'' ofmoderate growth and steady inflation.   ``Inflation remains at about the second-quarter rate. And afteradjusting for the effects of the drought, the economy continues togrow at its long-term average pace, which is 2 to 3 percent,'' hesaid.   However, private economists said the GNP report fits in withexpectations in financial markets that the Federal Reserve will movesoon to dampen growth, particularly if the November unemploymentreport, due this Friday, shows unemployment continuing at a 14-yearlow.   Growth so far in the second half of the year ``is too fast forstable inflation, which suggests there could be some further Fedtightening over the next few months,'' said Bruce Steinberg, aneconomist with Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.   Factories are operating at their highest level in more than eightyears. That, coupled with fewer people looking for jobs, could makeit difficult for manufacturers to produce enough goods to meetdemand.   Higher interest rates are aimed at easing the demand bydiscouraging spending by both consumers and businesses.   On Monday, major banks raised their prime lending rate to 10.5percent, the highest level since mid-1985. That will increase rateson a variety of consumer loans. If the Fed decides to tigthen, theprime rate could jump again before the end of the year, analysts say.   Robert Dederick, an economist with Northern Trust Co. in Chicago,said the mix of economic activity in the third quarter moved in theopposite direction from what Fed policymakers want.   Personal consumption expenditures, which account for nearlytwo-thirds of economic activity, rose at an annual rate of 4percent, compared with 3.0 percent in the second quarter.   The two engines of economic growth in the first half of the year_ exports and business investment _ played lesser roles.   The nation's inflation-adjusted trade deficit as measured by theGNP grew at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in the third quarter, thefirst deterioration in a year. Business investment grew at an annualrate of 4.8 percent in the third quarter, down from 15.0 percent inthe second quarter.   ``Consumer spending (growth) is at least double what they(Federal Reserve members) want to see. ... That's excessive if wewant to bring down our trade deficit without kicking up inflation,''Dederick said.   The various changes left the GNP, after adjusting for inflation,at an annual rate of $4.01 trillion.</TEXT></DOC>
