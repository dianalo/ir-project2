Inc. said its holders approved a management-led plan to take the company private in a leveraged buyout for $38.50 a share in cash, or $1.25 billion.    The transaction, which was approved by 76% of the shares voted, is expected to be completed by year-end.    Revco shares closed yesterday at $37.50, up 25 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    The holder approval ended a lengthy process that began last March, when the management group made a $1.16 billion offer consisting of $33 a share in cash and preferred stock valued at about $3. A committee of outside directors then recommended increasing the offer, and rumors surfaced that a competing bid might appear. After some delay, Revco's board accepted the sweetened offer in August.    The investor group acquiring the company is Anac Holding Corp., a newly formed, closely held company that includes about 35 members of current Revco management. Revco operates more than 2,000 drug stores.    In a leveraged buyout, a group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing. Ultimately, the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or by the sale of its assets. </TEXT></DOC>
