Rodgers to lead the DefenseCommunications Agency.andM;Rodgers, the commander of the Army's Information Systems Command (ISC) atFort Huachuca, Ariz., will return to Washington to replace Lt.andP;  Gen.andP;  John T.andO;Myers Jr.andP;  in June.andM;Rodgers took over ISC in mid-1988 after a one-year stint as the Army'sdirector of information systems for command, control, communications andcomputers (DISC4).andM;Last year, according to Pentagon and industry sources, Rodgers turned down anoffer from Army Secretary Michael P.W.andP;  Stone to reassume the DISC4 command.andO;Lt.andP;  Gen.andP;  Jerome B. Hilmes, a newcomer to IRM, became the DISC4 instead.andM;In the mid-1980s Rodgers was one of the driving forces behind the Army's movetoward an Information Mission Area (IMa), which included the DISC4 and ISC.andM;Army IRM officials generally credit Rodgers; retired Gen.andP;  Emmett Paige, theformer ISC commander; and retired Lt.andP;  Gen.andP;  Bruce R. Harris, Hilmes'predecessor as DISC4, as the main forces behind the IMA approach to Army ADP.andM;&quot;They are the people who got this thing off the ground,&quot; said David Borland,director of the Information Systems Selection and Acquisition Agency, theservice's principal ADP procurement shop.andM;In an address last year, Rodgers said IMa was formed when officials realizedthat &quot;we had too much data to move around and automation that was notsophisticated enough to handle it.&quot;andM;Recent technology developments have disrupted the logical distinction theArmy once drew between information, strategic and tactical computing andcommunications systems, Rodgers said.andM;&quot;The lines of demarcation between those types of systems are disappearing,&quot;he said.andM;Rodgers had endorsed publicly more joint service planning in the developmentof systems and expansion of the military's role in drug interdiction andborder control.andM;At DCA, Rodgers will oversee an agency that is, according to Myers, &quot;becomingincreasingly involved in drug interdiction.&quot;andM;In a recent address, Myers said about $70 million of the $550 million DCAbudget will support new requirements within DOD and other agencies fordevelopment of drug war-oriented C4 systems.andM;&quot;I think this activity will increase for [DCA] over the next few years andbecome a major new business area for us,&quot; he said.andM;DCA is primarily concerned with strategic systems, Myers said, but during anaddress last fall he agreed that the line between types of systems &quot;isgetting harder to find.&quot;andM;However, Myers took a dimmer view of how far integration of systems could betaken.andM;&quot;You'll never completely eliminate stand-alones because the functionalcommander will need them,&quot; Myers said.andP;  &quot;The challenge is to create a commondata set so that all systems are using the same basic information.&quot;andM;Myers, who was commander of DCA for about three years, will become deputydirector general of the NATO communications and information systems agency inBrussels, Belgium.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
