It is talking to Trans World Airlines about a special typeof financing that is usually arranged only for bankruptcycourt proceedings, people familiar with the talks said. Thespecial terms are said to provide for so-called&quot;debtor-in-possession&quot; backing by TWA.</LP><TEXT>   This type of financing is arranged for a company that isseeking reorganization. It normally becomes effective afterthe filing of a petition for bankruptcy, subject tobankruptcy court approval. The lender gets priority liens onunencumbered assets of the company and typically gets paidback before other creditors.   Asked whether the company is seeking such a type offinancing, a Pan Am spokesman said, &quot;we are not commenting onany such speculation.&quot; Mark Buckstein, general counsel atTWA, said, &quot;While we've had discussions with Pan Am, it'spremature to comment further on those discussions.&quot;   Pan Am's board is said to have discussed filing forChapter 11 bankruptcy court protection during a morningmeeting this past Wednesday. Thus far, Pan Am has confirmedonly that its board met and that it discussed the TWAproposal, as well as developments in the $400 million sale ofPan Am's London operations and other assets to UAL Corp.'sUnited Airlines.   Pan Am is said also to be asking United to extend it somefinancing, but the larger carrier is skittish about givingthe struggling line any money for fear it will be at risk ifPan Am ceases operations.   People familiar with Pan Am agreed the airline desperatelyneeds cash to cover daily costs and other debts. Like therest of the industry, Pan Am is being pinched by high jetfuel costs, the company's second-largest expense behindlabor.   It has outstanding bills to Airbus Industrie, the Europeanaircraft consortium; United Technologies Corp.'s Pratt andamp;Whitney engine-making unit and the Pension Benefit GuarantyCorp., a government agency that insures pension plans.   The TWA talks pertain to a merger proposal TWA owner CarlIcahn sent Pan Am Chairman Thomas Plaskett this past Sunday.Mr. Icahn proposed buying Pan Am's 150 million sharesoutstanding for $1.50 a share in cash and $1 a share inpreferred stock or notes. That amounts to $225 million incash and $100 million, at the most, in subordinated notes.The offer is slated to expire today, though Mr. Icahn mayextend it.   Pan Am executives are said to have told Mr. Icahn that PanAm needed some sort of bridge loan as part of any mergerproposal. A bridge loan is a type of short-term financingthat borrowers repay after they get a longer-term loan orcash from the sale of assets.</TEXT></DOC>
