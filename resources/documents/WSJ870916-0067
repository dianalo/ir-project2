The CAW has called membership meetings for this weekend that could vote on a new agreement if one is reached this week. While those meetings were arranged before the walkout, Robert White, CAW president, reiterated yesterday that they still could be ratification sessions.    The Canadian union, which represents about 10,000 Chrysler Canada workers, struck the auto maker's four Canadian plants after the union rejected the company's latest offer and the three-year labor contract expired at midnight EDT Monday.    So far the resulting layoffs in the U.S. haven't been large, but they demonstrate how tightly integrated Chrysler's Canadian and U.S. operations are. They also indicate how costly a prolonged Canadian walkout could be for the auto maker. In fact, only one Chrysler assembly plant in the U.S. doesn't use parts from Canada.    Yesterday, Chrysler's Belvidere, Ill., assembly plant operated only one half-shift instead of the normal full shift because of a shortage of Canadian-made parts. Today, the plant, which builds the company's new Dodge Dynasty and the Chrysler New Yorker cars, was scheduled to stop all production indefinitely, affecting 1,700 workers.    In addition, about 200 workers at the company's Warren, Mich., stamping plant were laid off Monday night and an additional 385 were laid off yesterday. The plant, which normally employs 2,800 hourly workers, makes doors and fenders for full-sized vans and minivans made in Canada.    The Warren plant also supplies parts to a Chrysler plant in St. Louis that makes about 40% of the company's Chrysler's minivans, but that production hasn't been effected.    A Chrysler spokesman said the strike didn't have any other &quot;immediate impact&quot; on U.S. production. Chrysler has said it stockpiled enough Canadian-made parts to keep most of its U.S. vehicle assembly plants operating for at least a month.    Analysts estimate that the cost of the current strike ranges from seven cents a share, or $15 million, to 15 cents a share, or $30 million, each week. Without a strike, David Healy, an industry analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said that Chrysler's net income for the current year would have been about $1.5 billion, or $6.75 a share.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Chrysler shares fell $1.125 to close at $43.25, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell sharply.    In November 1982, Chrysler laid off 4,600 workers at 20 U.S. parts plants within about a week of a Canadian workers' walkout. That strike ultimately lasted five weeks and cost Chrysler an estimated $100 million.    Yesterday, Gerald Greenwald, chairman of the company's Chrysler Motors unit, said in a statement that Chrysler was &quot;disappointed&quot; that the company and the union weren't able to reach an agreement before the deadline, but added it was a &quot;good sign that both sides have agreed to keep talking and we are encouraged that, with renewed effort, we can reach a fair agreement.&quot;    In negotiations yesterday, the two sides discussed the union's demand for inflation-indexed pensions. Chrysler's latest offer conceded -- for the first time -- the principle of indexing, but the union found it otherwise unacceptable. Negotiations were continuing late last night.    Chrysler workers in Canada have struck the company in each set of negotiations since 1959. The current talks, however, are the first since 1967 in which Chrysler was chosen as the target in Canada for a strike or a &quot;pattern-setting&quot; agreement. Talks between the union and the Canadian units of General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. are on hold pending the outcome of the Chrysler negotiations.    The union said it has a strike fund of 46 million Canadian dollars ($34.9 million), about 10 million dollars more than it had when it struck Chrysler for five days in 1985.    The company's two Canadian assembly plants produce about 8,500 trucks each week, including more than 6,000 of Chrysler's highly profitable Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager minivan models. Chrysler also has two parts plants in Canada. </TEXT></DOC>
