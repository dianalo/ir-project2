The arrests of German national Egbert Partesuis, 46, and AbdulAziz Ahmad, 40, capped an eight-month investigation into what ThomasMcDermott, special agent in charge, said was a ``significant case.''   ``The technology is such that it's being sought by the SovietBloc and there are people attempting to obtain it in this countryfor them,'' McDermott said.   Partesius was in the United States on a visitor's visa; Ahmed wasa resident alien living in Alexandria, Va.   Customs spokesman Charles Conroy said agents believe thatPartesuis, Ahmed and Hady Azimi, who remained in West Germany,conspired to purchase and export a digital equipment VAX 8820mainframe computer, which requires a validated export license fromthe U.S. Department of Commerce.   The VAX 8820 has military capabilities and is not eligible forlicensed export to Soviet bloc countries, Conroy said.   McDermott said the men intially paid $28,000 to agents workingundercover for an IBM computer with military applications andshipped it to West Germany.   ``At that purchase they came forward with the deposit to purchasethe VAX 882 and gave a initial deposit. Then last Thursday they cameforward with the balance of the $596,000,'' McDermott said.   Parthesuis and Ahmed were charged in U.S. District Court withviolating a 4-year-old federal arms export control law and withconspiracy and money laundering. If convicted on all counts, eachdefendant could receive up to 35 years in prison and a $2.5 millionfine.   The two are being held as federal prisoners at the MaricopaCounty Jail without bond, McDermott said.</TEXT></DOC>
