The petitionersubsequently amended the petition in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of August 24,1988 (53 FR 32276), by increasingproposed levels for pecans, stone fruits, apples, and grapes to 0.05. Thepetitioner has since withdrawn the request for tolerances for apples andgrapes.There were no comments received in response to the initial or amended noticeof filing.The data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have beenevaluated. The pesticide is considered useful for the purposes for whichthe tolerances are sought. The data submitted in support of the tolerancesinclude:1. Plant and animal metabolism studies.2. A rat oral lethal dose (LD<T2>50</T2>) with an LD<T2>50</T2> of 3,300 milligrams (mg) per kilogram (kg) of body weight (bwt)3. A rabbit subchronic dermal study (3-week) with a no-observed-effectlevel (NOEL) of 100 g/kg/day.4. A 90-day rat feeding study with a NOEL of 0.5 mg/kg/day.5. A 90-day dog feeding study with a NOEL of 25 mg/kg/day.6. A rat teratology study with a teratogenic and maternal toxicity NOELof 10 mg/kg/day (the teratogenic and maternal toxic level is 200 mg/kg/day(highest dose) with diaphragmatic hernia) and the fetotoxic NOEL of 1 mg/kg/day(Margin of Safety values are based on the developmental toxicity NOEL of1 mg/kg/day). 7. A rabbit teratology study with no terata at 90 mg/kg/day (highest dose)and a fetotoxic NOEL of 10 mg/kg/day.8. A two-generation rat reproduction study with a NOEL of 80 ppm (4 mg/kg/day).9. A 2-year chronic feeding/oncogenicity study in rats with no observedoncogenic potential under conditions of the study up to and including 3.0mg/kg/day (highest dose) and a systemic toxicity NOEL of 1 mg/kg/day.10. An 18-month mouse chronic feeding/oncogenicity study with no observedoncogenic potential up to and including 3.0 mg/kg/day (highest dose) anda systemic toxicity NOEL of 1.0 mg/kg/day.11. An Ames test (negative).12. A rat cytogenetic study (negative).13. An <T3>in vitro</T3> cell transformation assay (negative).14. An acute delayed neurotoxicity study in hens (negative).15. A 1-year dog feeding study with a NOEL of 5 mg/kg/day.Based on a NOEL of 1.0 mg/kg/day in the 2-year rat feeding study and ahundredfold safety factor, the acceptable daily intake (ADI) has been setat 0.01 mg/kg bwt/day. The theoretical maximum residue contribution (TMRC)from existing tolerances is 0.002100 mg/kg bwt/day. The current actionwill increase the TMRC by 0.000012 mg/kg/day (an increase of 0.57 percent).Published tolerances utilize 20.993 percent of the ADI; the current actionwill utilize an additional 0.111 percent. The nature of the residues is adequately understood, and an adequate analyticalmethod, high-pressure liquid chromatography using an ultraviolet detector,is available in the Pesticide Analytical Manual, Vol. II (PAM-II), forenforcement purposes.There are no regulatory actions pending against the registration of fluazifop-p-butyl.Based on the above information, the Agency concludes that the tolerancesestablished by amending 40 CFR 180.411 will protect the public health.Established tolerances for meat, milk, poultry, and eggs are adequate tocover any secondary residues transferring to animal tissues as a resultof the proposed use.Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days afterpublication of this document in the <T4>Federal Register, </T4>file written objections with the Hearing Clerk,at the address given above. Such objections should specify the provisionsof the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for the objections.If a hearing is requested, the objections must state the issues for thehearing and the grounds for the objections. A hearing will be granted ifthe objections are supported by grounds legally sufficient to justify therelief sought. The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L.96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determinedthat regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levelsor establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certificationstatement to this effect was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of May 4, 1981 (40 FR 24950).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 180</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Agricultural commodities, Pesticidesand pests, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: June 16, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Douglas D.
