The clinical features of radiation necrosis are very similarto those of tumor recurrence and differentiation of the two is frequentlydifficult. Appearances of the two conditions on x-ray CT, magnetic resonanceimaging, and angiography can be identical, and differential diagnosisfrequently requires surgical biopsy. Functional imaging by positron emissiontomography (PET) provides a new approach to this diagnostic problem andwe have used PET with rubidium-82 ({sup 82}Rb){sup 2} and {sup 18}F-2-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose({sup 18}F-FDG){sup 3} to distinguish recurrent tumor from necrosis inthis patient group. 4 refs., 1 fig.</TEXT></DOC>
