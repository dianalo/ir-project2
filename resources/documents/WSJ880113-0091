Ricks (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> SCR </IN><G> SEC </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   A profile of several &quot;new collectors&quot; of art and antiques in the Oct. 18 edition of the New York Times Sunday magazine featured David Bloom, a 23-year-old investment adviser. In that article, Mr. Bloom was quoted as saying, &quot;First I decide what I want to buy, then I worry about how I'm going to pay for it.&quot;    Now, the Securities and Exchange Commission thinks it knows how Mr. Bloom paid for his purchases.    In a complaint filed Monday in federal court in Manhattan, the SEC says that Mr. Bloom used most of his clients' $10 million not for securities investments as promised, but to buy expensive paintings, real estate and luxury automobiles.    Mr. Bloom's Greater Sutton Investors Group Inc. had about 100 clients. But he never registered with the SEC as an investment adviser, the agency says.    According to papers filed with the court, Mr. Bloom has entered into a consent decree under which he neither admits nor denies the allegations, but agrees to refrain from future violations of securities laws. He also has been barred for life from the securities industry.    Mr. Bloom also was ordered to turn over to a court-appointed receiver about $8 million in assets, including a Manhattan condominium; a house in East Hampton, Long Island; a 1988 Aston Martin Valente; a 1987 Mercedes-Benz 560 SEL; and 40 paintings, including works by John Singer Sargent, Mary Cassatt and Edward Hopper. The court order doesn't specify the disposition of the assets.    In 1986, Mr. Bloom began sending his clients &quot;fictitious&quot; account statements that purported to show their securities holdings, the complaint says. When clients requested the return of their funds, it says, they were paid with other clients' funds.    Given the October market crash, it isn't clear whether, by purchasing paintings rather than securities, Mr. Bloom preserved capital better than he would have by putting the funds in the stock market.    However, one gallery director notes that sales commissions for art are heavy, running 10% or more. &quot;You've got to overcome that before you even make any money,&quot; he says.    Mr. Bloom couldn't be reached for comment. His attorney, Peter Morrison, argues that because most of the assets of Mr. Bloom's clients have been preserved, &quot;little damage was done.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
