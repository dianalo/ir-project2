However, the Committee is greatly concerned withthe Commission's recent performance in protecting consumers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The reported bill, H.R. 3343, would restructure and r<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>authorize the CPSC. In particular, it would alterthe Commission's admini<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>trative structure, by making both the Chairman andthe staff more responsive to the Commission as a whole. The<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>legislation would improve and speed up the regulatoryprocess. The legislation would also increase the role of the states andst<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>te enforcement officials, such as attorneys general,in ensuring product safety, so that if the CPSC is unwilling or unableto act, states can step in to protect consumers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The l<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>gislation also would require action on certain products,such as all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), disposal cigarette lighters, and lawndarts. In particular, the legislation would require ATV manufa<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>c<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>turers to offer refunds for three whee<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>l<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> ATVs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Background and Need for the Legislation</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">i. background on cpsc_its function and authority</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="77">A. Function and Structure</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The CPSC was established by the Consumer Product <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>S<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>afety Act (CPSA), passed in 1972. The four primepurposes of the Safety Act are:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23"> ``(1) to protect the public against unreasonable risks of injuryassociated with consumer products; (2) to assist consumers in evaluatingthe comparative safety of consumer products; (3) to develop uniform safetystandards for consu<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>me<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>r products and to minimize conflicting state andlocal regulations; and (4) to promote research and investigation into thecauses and prevention of product-related deaths, illnesses, and injuries.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The CPSC is an independent regulatory commission. The statute providesthat it is to have five members, appointed by the Presi<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>d<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ent and confirmed by the Senate. The Chairman isappointed by the Pres<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>i<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>dent from among the members, subject to Senate confirmation.Currently, however, the appropriation for the CPSC only provides fundingfor three Commissioners. The current Chairman is Ter<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ence Scanlon, a Democrat. The other two Commissionersare Carol Dawson and Anne Graham, both Republ<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ica<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ns.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="77">B. Laws Administered</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The CPSC administers several statutes.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="87">1. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>C<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>onsumer Product Safety Act</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This is the basic act administered by the agency. It gives the CPSCauthority to set standards for products, to ban products where standardsare inad<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>quate, and to o<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>der recalls. (These powers a<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>e discussed in more detail below.)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="87">2. Federal Hazardous Substances Act (FHSA)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Formerly administered by the old Dep<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>rtment of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW), theadminist<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ation of this Act was transferred to the CPSC whenit was formed. This Act gives the Commission the authority to regul<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>a<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>te hazardous substances, for example, toxi<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>c<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> or flammable ho<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>u<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>sehold chemicals. It also applies to hazardous toysand allows the CPSC to recall dangerous toys.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="87">3. Poison Prevention Packaging Act</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This Act was also formerly administered by the old HEW and was transferredto the CPSC. It is the authority for the regulations requiring ``child-proof''drug containers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="87">4. Flammable Fabrics Act</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This Act was formerly administered by the old HEW, the Departmentof Commerce and the Federal Trade Commission and was transferred to theCPSC. It provides the CPSC authority to set flammability standards forfabrics.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="87">5. Refrigerator Safety Act</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This Act requires that refrigerator doors must be able to be openedfrom the in<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>side<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> to minimize the risk of suffocation to childrenwho may be trapped inside.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="77">C. Authority of the CPSC</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Consumer Product Safety Act gives the CPSC authority to take certainactions, including establishing product safety standards, banning products,and ordering recalls. These powers are described in more detail here.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="85">7<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>1. Promulgation of Consumer Product Safety Standard</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Commission, under Section 7 of the Act, may promulgate ConsumerProduct Safety Standards. These standards could eithe<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> establish performance (as opposed to design) requirementsor warning and instruction requirments. (Section 27 of the Act also givesthe Commission the authority to require the manufacturer to provide performanceand technical data to purchasers.) Any requirements established under Section7 must be ``reasonably necessary to prevent or reduce an unreasonable riskof injury'' associated with the product. Current standards deal with suchissues as matchbook requirements and safety standards for walk-behind powerlawn mowers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">However, the CPSC must rely upon voluntary standards rather than promulgatea mandatory standard when compliance with the voluntary standard ``wouldeliminate or adequately reduce the risk of injury addressed and it is likelythat there will be substantial compliance'' with the voluntary standard.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Consumer Product Safety Act re<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>q<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>uires an extensive procedure for a safety standardrulemaking. The agency is required to first issue and advance notice ofproposed rulemaking, a step that is generally voluntary for other agencies,followed by a notice of proposed rulemaking, followed by a final rule.If a voluntary standard is submitted which meets the criteria above, theCommission is required to terminate the rulemaking and rely on the voluntarystandard. As part of the rulemaking, the age<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>cy must do a preliminary and final regulatory analysis,including a cost-benefit analysis, and provide opportunity for an oralhearing (which is optional for most agencies, which generally rely on justwritten submissions in rulemaking proceedings).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="87">2. Banned Hazardous Products</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Commission may, under Section 8 of the Consumer Product SafetyAct, promulgate a rule banning a hazardous product if a product presentsan unreasonable risk of injury and ``no feasible consumer product safetystandard under this Act would adequately protect the public from the unreasonablerisk of injury associated with such product.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="87">3. Recall Authority</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Commission, under Section 15 of the Act, may order a recall ofa product if a failure to comply with a consumer product safety rule, ora product defect, creates a substantial risk of injury to the public. TheCommission may require the manufacturer or any distributor or retailerof the product to take one of three actions at the election of the manufactureror retailer. The options are to repair the product, replace the productwith a safe equivalent, or to refund the purchase price, less a reasonableallowance for use if the product has been used for more than a year. Whilethe manufacturer has the choice of remedy, the Commission can require submissionof a satisfactory action plan, which gives the agency influence over thechoice of remedy.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Act also requires manufacturers, distributors, and retailers toreport to the Commission information regarding likely product defects.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As a practical matter, most recalls are agreed to by the agency andthe manufacturer, as opposed to ordered under the Act.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="87">4. Imminent Hazard Authority</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As an alternative to a Section 15 recall, the Commission can filea Section 12 ``imminent hazard'' case in a U.S. District Court seekingthe seizure of a consumer product which ``presents imminent and unreasonablerisk of death, serious illness or severe personal injury.'' The court maygrant appropriate relief, including<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>requiring a recall or approp<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ria<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>te warning. The agency may take this action notwithstandingthe existence of a consumer product safety rule applicable to the productor the pendency of any administrative or judicial proceedings under anyother provision of the Act. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="87">5. Regulation of Chronic Hazards  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>e are special procedures that must be followed toregulate ``chronic'' hazards. The Commission may not begin the rulemakingprocess relating to chronic hazards (``a risk of cancer, bir<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>h defects, or gene mutations from a consumer product'')until the agency has first requested a Chronic Hazard Advisory Panel toreview the scientific data and other info<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>mation relating to the risk to determine ``if anysubstance in the product is a carcinogen, mutagen, or a teratogen'' andreports to the Commission. The agency must consider the report of the panelin its rulemaking. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Each Chronic Hazard Advisory Panel must consist of severn membersappointed by the CPSC from a list of scientists submitted by the Presidentof the National Academy of Sciences. Panel members cannot be federal employeesand cannot receive compensation f<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ro<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>m or have substantial financial interest in a<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>y manufacturer, distribut<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>o<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>r or retailer of a consumer product. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="87"/><T3>6. Exclusions From Jurisdiction  </T3><ITAG tagnum="21">Certain products are excluded fr<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>o<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>m the Commission's jurisdiction. These include productsnot customarily produced or distributed for sale to or use or consumptionby consumers, tobacco and tobacco products, moto<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> vehicles, pesticides, firear<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>m<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>s, aircraft, boats, drugs or c<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>o<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>smetics, and food. The rationale for most of theseexclusions is that these products are regulated by ot<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>he<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>r agencies under other statutes (i.e., NHTSA, FAA,Coast Guard, FDA). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In addition, fixed site amusement parks (but not mobile amusementrides) are cur<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ently excluded from the agency's jurisdiction.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="87"/><T3>7. Legislative Veto  </T3><ITAG tagnum="21">Most of the Acts administered by the agency have a legislative vetoprovision. These generally allow both Houses to veto any consu<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>me<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>r product safety rule within 90 calendar days (two-Houseveto) or one House to veto within 60 calendar days if <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>he other House does not object within 30 calendardays (one and a half House veto). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="87">8. Preemption of State Action  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Act preempts any different state or local standards which aredesigned to deal with the same risk of injury as a federal consumer prod<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>u<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ct safety standard. This preemption does not preventthe federal government or state and local governments from establishingstricter safety standards applicable to products for their <T3>own </T3>use (i.e., as part of a government procurement of a product.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>)<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Commission may waive preemption if a state or local safety standard``provides a significantly higher degree of protection'' than the federalstandard and it ``does not unduly burden interstate commerce.'' In consideringwhether there is an undue burden on interstate commerce, the agency isrequired to consider certain factors, such as the technological and economicfeasibility of comp<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>l<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>iance, the cost of compliance, the geographic distributionof the product, the probability of other states or local governments applyingfor a waiver and the need for a national, uniform standard for the produ<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>c<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>t.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="87"/><T3>9.

A more recent survey of retailers (last winter) hasfound an almost fifty percent rate of violation at the retail level. Thus,the Commission has failed to ensure compliance with regulations alreadyon the books. <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>I<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ndeed, partly because of the inability to enforcethese regulations, the Commission has recently proposed banning lawn dartscapable of causing puncture injury.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>About 170 people die annually from residential firesstarted by lighters, of which 120 are due to children playing with lighters.Ninety of the victims are children under five.

Four were transferred twice, and one employee was movedthree times. And even if these transfers and details were not made forinappropriate purposes, such frequent shuffling of personnel have a negativeeffect on an agency's ability to transact business and diminish the effectivenessof staff with a particular expertise.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>The Committee is also concerned with the inadequacyof the current level of product hazard reporting under Section 15(b) ofthe CPSA. Section 15(b) requires manufacturers (and distributors and retailers)to report to the CPSC instances where a product ``(1) fails to comply withan applicable consumer product safety rule; or (2) contains a defect whichcould create a substantial product hazard . . .'' A ``substantial producthazard'' in turn is defined as ``(1) a failure to comply with an applicableconsumer product safety rule which creates a substantial risk of injuryto the public, or (2) a product defect which (because of the pattern ofdefect, the number of defective products distributed in commerce, the severityof the risk, or otherwise) creates a substantial risk of injury to thepublic''.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>These criteria are somewhat subjective and industryoften prefers not to report potential hazards. Indeed, industry's failureto report is most pronounced for more severe hazards. According to a June6, 1988 letter from the CPSC to the Committee's Subcommittee on Commerce,Consumer Protection, and Competitiveness, during the period between October1982 and May 1988,<CODE-213>1</CODE-213></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23"><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>the more severe the hazard presented by a product,the more likely it was that Commission Headquarters and Field Compliancestaff, and not industry, would initiate an investigation. For `A' level[the most severe] hazards, staff-initiated investigations outnumbered Section15(b) report-initiated investigations 18 to 2; for `B+' hazards, the marginnarrowed to 19 to 7. However, for `B' level hazards, Section 15(b) report-initiatedinvestigations outnumbered investigations initiated by staff.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213></ITAG><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><ITAG tagnum="21">Thus, as a recent CPSC memorandum, commenting on these statistics,put it, ``It is apparent that industry reports only the lower level hazardsand that the Commission staff has the task of uncovering the serious productsafety defects.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Committee is also concerned about the restrictions which Section6(b) of the CPSA impose on the Commission with respect to information disclosure.The 6(b) process is very resource intensive for the Commission. It is estimatedthat the Commission spends about half a million dollars and five employeeyears per year to implement the provisions of Section 6(b). At the sametime, the restrictions of Section 6(b) delay access by the public to informationdeveloped or received by the CPSC.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="77">B. The Proposed Solutions</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">To address these problems, this legislation would improve the Commission'sadministrative structure, its regulatory process, and the way it dealswith certain products. The legislation would also improve the state role,so that if the CPSC is unwilling or unable to act, states can step in toprotect consumers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The legislation would speed up and improve the regulatory processby requiring the Commission to begin the regulatory process if it findsthat there may be an unreasonable risk of injury associated with a productand that a safety rule would reduce the risk. This would not prevent thedevelopment of a potentially acceptable voluntary standard but rather shouldspeed up both the voluntary standard development process and the regulatoryprocess, for the benefit of consumers. And to examine a possible meansto reimburse the CPSC for the costs involved, the reported bill requiresthe CPSC to study the feasibility of requiring user fees to defray thecost of deve<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>l<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>oping a mandatory standard.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The legislation also provides that the Commission may only rely onvoluntary standards which are actually in existence at the time the Commissionmakes its reliance decision and which are or have been developed througha consensus process, including consideration of the views of consumers.The Committee emphasizes that these changes are not intended to stop orhinder the development of voluntary standards in the future, but ratherto speed up and improve the process. Indeed, the requirement that the Commissionmay only rely on voluntary standards which are in existence at the timeof reliance is really just a clarification of existing law. For example,the Conference Report accompanying the 1981 amendments to the CPSA makesclear that the Commission can only defer to voluntary standards which areboth ``adopted'' and ``implemented''. Nevertheless, the Commission hassometimes mistakenly assumed that it should defer even beginning a rulemakingproceeding based on its hope that a voluntary standard might be developed.This clarification is intended to correct this misimpression.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">To address the problems raised by the lawn dart experience, the legislationrequires the CPSC to review its lawn dart regulations to determine if stricterrequirements, such as a ban, are required. (The Commission has alreadybegun this process, by proposing a ban of certain lawn darts.) The billalso provides that violation of a labeling requirement would give the Commissiongrounds for a recall. And to make it easier to take enforcement action,the bill establishes civil penalties under the Federal Hazardous SubstancesAct, similar to those under the Consumer Product Safety Act. Finally, toimprove the state role and speed up enforcement, the bill would allow stateattorneys general (or other state consumer enforcement officials) to seekimmediate court enforcement of safety rules if a violation results in imminenthazard or recurring or ongoing harm to the public, instead of having towait 30 days, as under current law.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">To address the ATV situation, the bill would require the ATV manufacturersto offer appropriate refunds to past purchasers of the dangerously unstablethree wheel ATVs. The bill would also ban the commercial sale of threewheel ATVs not subject to the ATV settlement agreement, extend free ridertraining to all past purchasers of four wheel ATVs, and require the CPSCto promulgate a safety performance and design standard for four wheel ATVs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">To address the disposable lighter situation, the bill requires theCommission to begin proceedings to establish a safety standard for lighters,taking into account the need to protect children. (In response to a longpending petition and this legislation, the CPSC has recently issued anadvance notice of proposed rulemaking to address the child resistance oflighters.) The bill would also require the CPSC to adopt a plan to monitorcompliance with certain voluntary industry safety standards. And, in lightof the fact that the Commission took over two years to act on the petitionfiled by a nurse in 1985 to require that disposable lighters be child-resistant,the bill would require the CPSC to act within 120 days on citizen petitionsto begin a rulemaking proceeding.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">To improve product hazard reporting, the legislation would supplementthe current Section 15(b) reporting requirements by requiring reportingin two additional instances. First, reporting would be required of productrelated lawsuits involving death or serious injury. The Committee recognizesthat the mere filing of a pro<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>duct<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>-related lawsuit does not mean a defect exists, butthe Commission should be provided information about such lawsuits to determineif further investigation might be warranted. Such information could serveas an ``early warning system'' for the Commission. Second, industry wouldbe required to report instances of failures of products to comply withapplicable voluntary safety standards which the Commission has formallyrelied upon under Section 7(b) of the CPSA, in lieu of promulgating a mandatoryrule.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">To address the problems caused by the information disclosure restrictionsof Section 6(b), the legislation would expedite the release of non-tradesecret information which was not developed by the Commission (such as consumercomplaints), while maintaining the current right of manufacturers to reviewand comment on brand specific information before release.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">To improve and reorganize the CPSC's administrative structure andto ensure that the Chairman of the Commission works closely with the otherCommissioners, the legislation provides that the Chairman is to be electedby the other Commissioners. This change would be effective 30 days afterenactment to quickly begin the process of rebuilding the Commission andensuring collegial decision-making. At the same time, to address the problemof retaliatory transfers, the legislation would ensure that top staff officialsof the Commission would be more responsive to the Commission as a whole.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">To speed the work of the CPSC, the legislation also provides for aquorum of two Commissioners when there are only three sitting Commissioners.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">iii. all-terrain vehicles_why a legislative refund option is necessary</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="77"/><T3>A. Background</T3><ITAG tagnum="21">All-terrain vehicles (ATVs) are three and four wheeled motorized off-roadvehicles. As a result of their design_a high center of gravity, solid rearaxles, in some cases a lack of suspension, and, in some models, only threewheels_they have a tendency to become unstable and tip over. This has resultedin numerous injuries and deaths, especially to children and teenagers.Since 1982, over 1000 people have been killed and 330,000 injured on ATVs.There are about 20 deaths and 7000 injuries each month associated withATVs. Almost one half of the injuries and deaths involve children under16.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Some in the industry, which is composed mostly of four Japanese firms,Honda, Suzuki, Kawasaki, and Yamaha, and one American firm, Polaris, havemarketed ATVs to children as young as six. Models marketed to childrenare smaller. Polaris, which markets only to adults age 18 and over andmanufactured fewer than 2000 three wheel ATVs, discontinued three wheelATV sales about two years ago. The industry contends that injuries aremostly due to <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ow<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>er<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> misuse, such as driving while intoxicated or failingto wear a helmet, not to vehicle design.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In response to reports of numerous injuries and deaths associatedwith ATVs, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) established anATV Task Force in April of 1985 to review the safety issues r<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>aised<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>. In add<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>i<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>tion, on May 31, 1985, the Commission published anadvance notice of proposed rulemaking, preliminarily determining ``thatthere may be unreasonable risk of injury associated with the use of all-terrainvehicles (ATV's) which may be sufficiently severe to require regulatoryaction by the Commission'' and discussing alternative ways to address therisks presented by ATVs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In July of 1<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>9<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>86, the House Committee on Government Operations,after a hearing by its Subcommittee on Commerce, Consumer, and MonetaryAffairs, issued an oversight report finding that three wheel ATVs presented``both an unreasonable and an imminent risk of death and serious injuryrequiring immediate enforcement action'' by the CPSC. The report recommendedthat three wheel ATVs should be recalled.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The CPSC's ATV Task Force reported to the Commission on September30, 1986. The report included a number of findings regarding the natureof injuries and deaths resulting from ATV use, including a finding thattypically, children under 12 are unable to operate any size ATV safely.The report also included a number of recommendations for future Commissionaction.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The CPSC responded in two ways. Publicly, in a December, 1986 meeting,it decided to work with the industry on the development of a voluntarystandard, even though the agency expressed unhappiness with the industry'sefforts to date. The Commission also decided to ask the industry to voluntarilycease marketing to children under twelve (a request which was subsequentlyrefused).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Secondly, in a December 1986 enforcement meeting which was not opento the public, the Committee understands that the Commission agreed tofile an action in Federal court under section 12 of the Consumer ProductSafety Act (CPSA). It was to declare ATVs imminently hazardous and requirea notice, a warning, free training for all past and future purchasers,and require manufacturers to offer refunds, at the purchasers' option,for all adult sized ATVs purchased for children under 16 and all otherthree wheel ATVs. Under section 12 of the law, if the court finds thata product, namely ATVs, present an ``imminent and unreasonable risk ofdeath, serious illness or severe personal injury'', it can order appropriaterelief, including requiring a recall, refund or appropriate warning.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Throughout 1987, the Commission legal staff, working with the JusticeDepartment, prepared for the initiation of the enforcement action. However,the work of the agency was serious<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ly<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> disrupted when the Chairman of the Commission, inearly June of 1987, unilaterally removed two experienced attorneys fromthe CPSC's ATV litigation team, over the vigorous protests of the othertwo Commissioners. While the replacement attorneys were experienced lawyers,they lacked the expertise in the ATV matter that the two original attorneyshad. Thus, the replacement of the attorneys caused delay.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In November 1987, the Committee's Subcommittee on Commerce, ConsumerProtection<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> and Competitiveness approved, by an 11-4 bipartisanvote, this legislation to reauthorize the CPSC. As introduced, this legislationincluded a provision requiring ATV manufacturers to offer refunds or similarremedies to past purchasers of certain ATVs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="77">B. The Complaint and Consent Decrees</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In late November, the CPSC<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>initiated settlement discussions with the ATV industry.The four Japanese companies negotiated together and the one American company,Polaris<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>,<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> negotiated separately. In mid-December, the CPSCdecided to seek consent decrees with the industry, and, at the urging ofthe Justice Department, decided not to inform the public and Congress ofits decision. The Commission was apparently willing to settle with theindustry without seeking the refund remedy, despite the Commission's earliervote and the Subcommittee's action. Under the Justice Department's plan,no information would be publicly released or provided to Congress untila December 30 press conference. However, the Committee's Subcommittee onCommerce, Consumer Protection, and Competitiveness, along with the Commerce,Consumer and Monetary Affairs Subcommittee of the Government OperationsCommittee, learned of the Commission and Justice Department plan and eachSubcommittee sent letters to the Commission on December 18, expressingconcerns at the reports and requesting information on the CPSC's activities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">On December 30, the Justice Department and the CPSC filed a complaintagainst the ATV industry in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., alongwith two preliminary consent decrees, one negotiated with the four foreigncompanies and one negotiated with Polaris. The preliminary consent decreeswere binding agreements with the companies, but providing that certaindetails were to be subject to further negotiation. The Commission had earlierapproved the two consent decrees by a two to one vote.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">According to the allegations in the CPSC complaint:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="23"> The risk of harm presented by ATVs is both imminent and unreasonable.Each time an ATV is operated, a rider who is not aware of the unique handlingcharacteristics of the vehicle . . . faces an unacceptably high risk that,at any moment and with no sign of impending danger, he or she will eitherbe killed or suffer a severe personal injury . . . defendants have falselyand deceptively promoted ATVs as safe, easy-to-operate vehicles for theentire family. . . . Defendants have created the illusion that ATVs caneasily and safely `go anywhere,' when in fact ATV operation on some typesof terrain is extremely hazardous.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The preliminary consent decree required the ATV manufacturers to:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> stop marketing of three wheel ATVs;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> mail a notice to all known past purchasers of ATVs informing themof risks associated with the vehicles;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> provide all American distributors and ATV dealers with four-foot-by-four-footsigns containing the same warnings, which must be displayed prominently;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> offer to repurchase all new and never-before-sold three wheel ATVsin dealer inventories;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> affix warning labels to all ATVs marketed and sold in the UnitedStates;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> warn users of risks associated with ATVs in owner's manuals;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> establish a toll-free hotline phone number for consumer questionson ATVs and their risks and hazards;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> offer free hands-on training for all future ATV purchasers as wellas those who purchased ATVs in the past 12 months;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> agree not to oppose state legislation requiring licensing and certificationof ATV operators to the extent that legislation provides for age limitsfor ATV operators consistent with those in the preliminary consent decree;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> agree to undertake a public awareness campaign consisting of printadvertisements and radio and television commercials dealing with the potentialhazards and risks associated with ATVs; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> agree to advertise minimum age limits for various ATV models (thedecrees require ATV manufacturers to market ATVs with engines between 70and 90cc only to those riders aged 12 and older, and to market machineswith engine size above 90cc only to riders aged 16 and older).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The preliminary consent decree also required the industry to attemptto reach agreement on voluntary standards satisfactory to the CPSC withinfour months of the Court's approval of the final consent decree. The CPSCwas required to provide the industry with a draft proposed standard bythe end of January. The draft proposed standard included requirments regardingcontrol and part design and vehicle performance, including lateral stability.The preliminary consent decree also provided that to the extent that threewheel ATVs met mandatory or negotiated voluntary ATV standards, they couldbe remarketed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The preliminary consent decree provided that a final consent decreewould be negotiated and submitted to the Court within 45 days (by February13). However, the CPSC, DOJ, and the industry subsequently agreed to, andthe Court approved, an extension until March 14, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">On Monday, March 14, the CPSC approved the final consent decree withthe ATV industry. The decree was filed in U.S. District Court on the sameday and was subject to the approval of the Court.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The final decree was substantively very similar to the preliminarydecree filed on December 30. However, it included considerably more detailon the nature of the media awareness campaign and the warning and labelingthat the industry agreed to engage in.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The final decree also provided more detail for the hands-on trainingprogram the industry agreed to. The industry also agreed to offer new ATVpurchasers an incentive (a U.S. savings bond worth $100 at maturity, fiftydollars in cash or a $50 merchandise certificate) to take a training course.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">On April 28, after an oral hearing on April 18, the District Courtapproved the final consent decree, with sli<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>g<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ht modification, which included the ability of theCPSC to seek administrative relief under section 15 of the CPSA or Section15 of the FHSA, or both, including recall or repurchase, after December31, 1990.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The settlement, however, provided no requirement for the ATV manufacturersto offer a refund or similar remedy to the estimated 1.5 million past purchasersof three wheel ATVs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It is important to note that of the two CPSC Commissioners who votedto approve the consent decree, Commissioner Carol Dawson expressed hercontinuing support of the refund remedy, noting that the ``refund provisionis not only fair, but would have sent a strong public safety message.''However, Commissioner Dawson stated her belief that it would be difficultand time-consuming to achieve the refund remedy in section 12 litigationby the CPSC. Chairman Scanlon continued to oppose any refunds for consumers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">There are a number of other concerns with the consent decree. First,it is important to note that the manufacturers had already stopped productionof three wheel ATVs. Furthermore, while the consent decree required theindustry ``to attempt in good faith to reach agreement on voluntary standardssatisfactory to the Commission within four months of the Court's approval''of the final consent decree, there was no guarantee that such standardswould be developed within that time frame. Indeed, the four month periodexpired on August 28 and there is still no final agreement on voluntarystandards.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="77">C. H.R. 3991, the ATV User Safety and Equity Act and the CommitteeAmendment</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">On February 24, 1988, Congressman Barton introduced a companion bill,H.R. 3991, the ATV User Safety and Equity Act. That legislation would banthe sale of three wheel ATVs (except that individual sales by private individualswould not be prohibited) and would require manufacturers to offer refundsfor three wheel ATVs purchased before the date of enactment. It would alsorequire the CPSC to issue safety performance and design standards for ATVswithin one year. If the CPSC did not act within that time, the CPSC draftperformance standard of January 1988, would be mandated as an interim standard.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">On March 16, the Committee's Subcommittee on Commerce, Consumer Protection,and Competitiveness held a hearing on H.R. 3991. Testimony at the hearingconfirmed that a refund option would reduce serious injuries associatedwith ATVs.

The bill is in response to a consent decreeagreed upon in <T3>United States </T3>v. <T3>American Honda Motor Co., </T3>CA No. 87-3525 (D.D.C.). A preliminaryconsent decree was approved and entered by the court on December 30, 1987,and a final consent decree is currently pending before the court. Underthe decree, all future sales of ATVs would be halted and a detailed programof training and education for ATV owners would be instituted. The ConsumerProduct Safety Commission would retain the right to seek further relief,including recall and repurchase, if new and substantial evidence indicatedthat a more extensive remedy was warranted.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Constitutional objections to the bill have been varied. First, itis argued that, by legislating to ban sales and to require recalls andrefunds, Congress is usurping the role of the courts in interpreting andapplying the CPSA and Congress is impermissibly interfering with the consentdecree. Second, it is argued that, by so legislating, Congress is deprivingthe manufacturers of the procedural due process protection they would enjoyif the CPSC were administratively acting under the statute. Third, it isargued that, by directing refunds to prior purchasers, Congress is impermissiblyinfringing upon a property interest of the manufacturers in violation eitherof substantive due process or the taking clause, both provisions of theFifth Amendment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">While resolution of these issues is not completely free of doubt,it appears that the precedents, many of them cited and relied on by thememoranda submitted in opposition to the bill, support the validity ofthe action proposed to be taken.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">first</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It is, of course, axiomatic that when Congress legislates on a broadrange of matters, the executive and judicial branches in appropriate circumstancesinterpret and apply the law. This state of things in no way deprives Congressof the power to legislate to expand, contract, or otherwise alter the law,even though issues of interpretation and application are currently beforethe courts. The rule goes back to the decision in <T3>United States</T3> v. <T3>Schooner Peggy,</T3> 1 Cr. (5 U.S.) 103 (1801), that a court must giveeffect to the law as it exists at the time it renders its decision, absenta manifest injustice arising from doing so, rather than applying the lawin effect at an earlier time. Thus, if a lower court decision, correctwhen rendered, has been disturbed by an intervening statute, the responsibilityof an appellate court is to set aside that judgment and apply the new law,absent very special circumstances. <T3>Id., </T3>110.

Sustaining the new law,the Court opined: ``So far . . . as this bridge created an obstructionto the free navigation of the river, in view of the previous acts of Congress,they are to be regarded as modified by this subsequent legislation; and,although it still may be an obstruction in fact, [it] is not so in thecontemplation of law.'' <T3>Id., </T3>430.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The <T3>Wheeling andamp; Belmont <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>B<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ridge </T3>case has had a lengthy progeny in thecontext of Congre<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ss<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> setting aside determinations by the Court that somestate action constituted an impermissible burden on interstate commerce.Because i<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>is Congress which is given the power to regulateinterstate commerce, it may authorize the States to do what the Court saysthey cannot.

With respect to rights created by Congress, as Klein'swas in part, Congress can prescribe rules of decision, by specifying standardsand burdens of proof, rights and entit<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>l<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ements, and so on. It is such a st<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>atu<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>te that a court ordinarily applies.

Congress would in enacting it be amending the CPSA specificallyto apply to the ATVs. The underlying law would be altered. The statutedoes not attempt to compel a court on the basis of a reading of the unchangedlaw to reach a different result. Congress compels a different result, assumingthe court on its own would have reached a different result, by statutorychange.

Since here there are only five manufacturer<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> concerned, a limited number up<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>on <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>whom there will be an exceptional effect, the argumentimplies, the manufact<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>u<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>rers must receive the <T3>Londoner</T3> result, procedural protection.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">More critical in distinguishing the two cases from the ATV situationis that both <T3>Londoner</T3> and <T3>BiMetallic</T3> concerned agency action pursuant to legislative delegation,even though in <T3>Londoner</T3> the assessment was finally imposed through legislati<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ve <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>action of a body subordinate to the state legislature,whereas the ATV bill, if passed, would be purely a legislative action.The fact that the bill would affect known companies or individuals wouldbe irrelevant. The bill, if passed, would mandate a recall and refund.The only question would be whether any particular vehicle was in fact athree-wheeled ATV, a matter hardly meriting a procedural hearing. For example,when a state bans a lottery, that determines the matter; the lottery operatoris not entitled to some sort of procedural hearing, because there is nothingfurther to determine. Cf. <T3>Stone </T3>v. <T3>Mississippi,</T3> 101 U.S. 814 (1880). And the legislature may establishas a cause for revocation of a benefit or imposition of a detriment a plain,factual happening as to which the executing agency need only accord a <T3>pro forma</T3> kind of hearing. E.g., <T3>Dixon </T3>v. <T3>Love, </T3>431 U.S. 105 (1977) (revocation of driver's license uponconviction of offense implicates next to no procedure); <T3>Mackey </T3>v. <T3>Montrym,</T3> 443 U.S. 1 (1979) (same as to suspension of license forrefusal to take breath-analysis test). Certainy, an agency to divest someoneof a property interst has to give notice and an opportunity to be heard;but when a legislature enacts a provision which imposes a new conditionupon ownership with divestiture for failure to comply, it need not provideany notice at all, beyond publication of the law, to any affected party.<T3>Texaco </T3>v. <T3>Short,</T3> 454 U.S. 516 (1982).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In other words, after enactment of the law there would be no<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>facts to adjudicate and thus no necessity for a hearing.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">third</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It is also argued that by mandating a recall of already sold ATVsand requiring the manufacturers to give refunds to the purchasers, thebill would violate the Fifth Amendment, either the takings clause or thesubstantive aspects of the due process clause. The takings clause requiresjust compensation for the taking of property for a public use, and theCourt has analyzed regulation of the use of property as a form of taking,because of the deprivation suffered by the owner in not being able to makeprofitable use of the property. Substantive due process, once prevalentas a <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>limitation <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>upon government's ability to regulate economic interests,is a restriction upon governmental power to prescribe or proscribe certaineconomic activities. In the regulatory area, the Court has not drawn aclear line between the two concepts and sometimes has utilized both kindsof analyses in the same case. See <T3>Williamson County Regional Planning Comm. </T3>v. <T3>Hamilton Bank, </T3>473 U.S. 172 (1985) (1 and use plan restrictions).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The opponent's argument also stress<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>es<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> the retroactive nature of the refund obligation;necessarily, the requirement imposes a duty to undo a past occurrence_saleof ATVs_involving a financial detriment to the companies. It is evidentfrom the Court's precedents that retroactive economic regulation is subjectto scrutiny beyond the ordinary lenient due process review of such legislationin it<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> prospective operation, in that the retroactive effectof law must itself serve a valid purpose<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>.<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> <T3>PBGC </T3>v. <T3>Gray andamp; Co., </T3>467 U.S. 717, 730 (<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>1<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>984). Because, the opponents assert, government couldbar the <T3>use</T3> of ATVs in private hands, as well as bar future sales, andachieve its safety objectives, the imposition of the refund obligationdoes not serve a valid purpose.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The retroactivity argument appears to be rebuttable through two interrelatedarguments which could prove convincing to Congress. First, Congress couldview the removal from private ownership of ATVs as a far-superior safetyprotection to a difficult-to-enforce ban on private use. Whether this stepis a superior one would appear to the kind of congressional judgement thatthe Court has said must be deferred to ``unless it is demonstrably arbitraryor irrational,'' <T3>Duke Power Co. </T3>v. <T3>Carolina Environmental Study Group, </T3>438 U.S. 59, 83-84 (1978).In the context of a state case, the Court has made the point that the reviewis so deferential that the challenging party may not offer evidence toprove that the legislature is wrong in its judgement that this purposewill be served, so long as the question is at least debatable, becausethe issue is whether the legislature ``could rationally have decided''that its goal would be effectua<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ted<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>, <T3>Minnesota </T3>v. <T3>Clover Leaf Creamery Co., </T3>449 U.S. 456<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>, 466<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> (1981), though, of course, the challenging partymay present evidence to show that a judgment is wholly irrational. <T3>United States </T3>v. <T3>Carolene Products Co., </T3>304 U.S. 144, 153-154 (1938).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Second, Congress could rationally determine that the refund obligationis a way of spreading the costs of furthering its safety purpose. <T3>Usery </T3>v. <T3>Turner-Elkhorn Mining Co., </T3>428 U.S. 1, 14-20 (1976). In this case,the Court sustained Congress' determination to impose upon coal mine operatorsthe liability of compensating <T3>former</T3> employees who had terminated work in the industry beforepassage of the law for black lung disabilities contracted in the courseof their work.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">With the retroactivity issue out of the way, it is possible now toreview the takings-substantive due process arguments. Although the caselaw is extensive in recent years, the most important general principleto observe is that the Court has found no substantive due process violationin the field of economic regu<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>lat<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ion and the only takings violations it has foundhave involved actual deprivations of property or of the use of propertyfrom owners for the use and general benefit of the public. <T3>Nollan</T3> v. <T3>California Coastal Comm.,</T3> 107<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>S. Ct. 3141 (1987) (in order to obtain permit toimprove house, owners had to dedicate strip of beachfront for public passage);<T3>Loretto</T3> v. <T3>Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp.,</T3> 458 U.S. 419 (1982) (buildingowner had to dedicate space on exterior of building at <T3>de minimus</T3> payment for installation of cable); <T3>Kaiser Aetna</T3> v. <T3>United States,</T3> 444 U.S. 164 (1979) (imposition of navigable servituderequiring public access to pond premised on owners' dredging at considerableexpense of channel that made it navigable). Otherwise, all the time acknowledgingthat some regulation could go too far, the Court has upheld land use andother regulation serving a public purpose which imposed considerable expenseupon property owners or which deprived them of much of the profitable useof their property. E.g., <T3>Penn Central Transp. Co.</T3> v. <T3>City of New York,</T3> 438 U.S. 104 (1978) (owner of building designateda landmark denied right to construct office building atop it from whichit reasonably anticipated a net of $2 million annually in rent); <T3>Andrus</T3> v. <T3>Allard,</T3> 444 U.S. 51 (1979) (ban on sale of artifacts made fromeagle feathers applied to existing inventory of dealer, leaving him onlythe profits to be earned in displaying artifacts); <T3>Keystone Bituminous Coal Assn.</T3> v. <T3>DeBenedictis,</T3> 107 S. Ct. 1232 (1978) (requirement that 50% ofcoal in support estate underlying certain structures be left in place toprevent subsidence damage, although companies in selling surface rightshad specifically reserved mining rights).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Because the cases are numerous and present many complex factual situations,it may not be possible to draw general standards from the cases. It isnoteworthy, however, that the Court, and even some dissenters who wouldprefer closer scrutiny of regulation, place a high value upon the interestin the protection of health, safety, and welfare of the public. E.g., <T3>DeBenedictis, supra,</T3> 1242; <T3>Agins</T3> v. <T3>City of Tiburon,</T3> 447 U.S. 255, 260-261 (1980); <T3>Penn Central, supra,</T3> 144-150 (Justice Rehnquist dissenting). See<T3>Goldblatt</T3> v. <T3>Town of Hempstead,</T3> 369 U.S. 590 (1962) (terminating further miningwith severe consequent costs to owners of gravel and sand pit around whichtown had recently expanded); <T3>Hadacheck</T3> v. <T3>Sebastian,</T3> 239 U.S. 394 (1915) (restricting owner of brick factoryfrom continuing his use after residential growth surrounding factory madeuse noxious, reducing value by more than 90%). An important precedent is<T3>Miller</T3> v. <T3>Schoene,</T3> 276 U.S. 272 (1928), in which the Court sustained a governmentaldecision to require the destruction of ornamental red cedar trees infectedwith rust that threatened contamination of neighboring profitable appleorchards. The owner of the cedars was not entitled to compensation, held<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>the <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Court, because the government could prefer the publicinterest in saving cash crops to the property interest in ornamental trees.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It would thus appear that under the C<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>o<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>urt's precedents it would find rational and permissiblethe determination by Congress to require a recall of the ATVs and the impositionof the burden of protecting the public interest in safety upon the manufacturersrather than upon the private owners. The safety hazard is <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>n<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ot alone a problem of the owners themselves but itas well presents a problem to third parties who may become involved inaccidents with the owners, who may use the vehicles themselves, or whomay without notice of the hazard purchase from an owner. In those circumstances,Congress could well decide, as it did in <T3>Usery</T3>, that the companies that had benefi<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ed so much from the produce for years should bearthe costs of protecting public safety.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">fourth</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Recurring throughout the memoranda of the opponents of the bill isthe suggestion that because Congress would be legislating about a specificand particular subject matter, it would be acting improperly. It is indicatedthat by directing a ban on sales and a recall and refund of these ATVsproduced by five companies Congress is behaving like a court or the executiverather than like a legislature; in another place, the view is presentedthat something like a bill of attainder would be presented because thecompanies are so ea<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ily identified, are, in fact, known beforehand.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Any argument that a legislature must act with such generality thatthose affected are not known in advance is not supported by any case law(save in those States which have constitutional provisions particularlydirected to the matter). To take one notable example, when former_PresidentNixon made arrangements for the custody and confidentiality of his papersand other materials produced during his time in office, Congress legislatedspecifically to provide rules applicable only to him. In <T3>Nixon</T3> v. <T3>Administrator of General Services,</T3> 433 U.S. 425 (1977), the Courtsustained that law against a variety of attacks, including bill of attainderchallenges, finding that Mr. Nixon constituted a ``legitimate class ofone.'' <T3>Id.</T3>, 472. To be sure, if a legislature's in<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ent is to punish and does so directed to identifiablepersons, a law could be an impermissible bill of attainder or an <T3>ex post facto</T3> law. See <T3>United States</T3> v. <T3>Lovett,</T3> 328 U.S. 303 (1946). But the purposes of the bill in is<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>s<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ue are regulatory rather than punitive. <T3>Nixon, supra,</T3> 468-484. That due process and equal protection arenot denied by legislation's limitation to an identifiable few, or evenone, is evident from <T3>City of New Orleans</T3> v. <T3>Dukes,</T3> 427 U.S. 297 297 (1976), in which the city council hadbanned all pushcart vendors from the French Quarter, save for those thathad been in<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>continuous operation for more than eight years, anexception that benefi<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>t<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ed one company and was apparently intended to benefitonly that company. The Court gave extreme defe<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ence to the legislative classification and held thatonly if it were wholly arbitrary, in the sense of invidiously discriminatory,would <CODE-213>5</CODE-213>it <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>be struck down. In the course of the decision, theCourt overruled <T3>Morey</T3> v. <T3>Doud,</T3> 354 U.S. 457 (1957), one of the rare cases in recent yearsstriking down an economic classification. <T3>Morey</T3> concerned a regulation of ``currency exchanges'' which hadexempted by name the American Express Company from regulation. Thus, itappears that either by naming a company or individual or by so describingas to amount to the same thing, a legislature may enact an otherwise valideconomic regulation that applies to or exempts that company or individual.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Even if there were such a principle in constitutional law, outsidethe bill of attainder and perhaps some other contexts, it is difficultto see how the principle would be infringed by a law that reached all theindividuals or companies that are the source of the problem. Here, thereare only five manufactures of these kinds of ATVs. The law would applyequally to all of them. No singling out occurs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">No singling out, that is, unless the opponents are su<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>g<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>gesting that Congress must legislate at an extremelyhigh level of generality. It could be that they are saying that Congressmust legislate about hazardous consumer products generally and must leaveto an agency the specific application of the general law. But, to reiterate,there is no such principle, as the <T3>Nixon</T3> case demonstrates, much less what may be drawn from <T3>Dukes.</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The opponents do have one case on which to rely, but it is an idiosyncraticprecedent indeed. In <T3>News America Publishing</T3> v. <T3>FCC,</T3> No. 88-1037 (D.C. Cir., March 29, 1988), a divided courtheld unconstitutional a congressional provision denying the FCC the authorityto extend the time period of any current waiver of the prohibition of commonownership of a daily newspaper and a television station in certain marketareas. The only holder of waiver was the plaintiff company, and the courtheld the limitation to constitute a violation of the specialized equalprotection standard applied to First Amendment interests. E.g., <T3>Carey</T3> v. <T3>Brown,</T3> 447 U.S.<CODE-213>5</CODE-213> <CODE-213>0</CODE-213>455 (1980). Whatever the m<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>aning of this decision in the context in which itwas rendered_the area of press freedom_it is difficult to see qualifyingthe substantial amount of precedent reviewed above.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">conclusion</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">After reviewing the memoranda submitted in opposition to the billin question, we do not disc<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ern<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> in the precedents cited nor in other precedentsstudied any substantial problem with the validity of the bill if enacted.It would not impermissibly interfere with the judicial process nor doesit subject any decision of a court to an impermissible revisory review.It does not deny the companies any procedural due process to which theyhave been held entitled. The case law with respect to substantive due processand takings, while not clear and settled, will admit of interpretationsthat would support congressional action. Finally, there would appear tobe no principle in the case law that would limit the specificity of thelegislation under consideration.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="56">Johnny H.

Killian, Senior Specialistin American Constitutional Law, by memorandum dated June 6, 1988 examinedthe relevant case law and concluded that legislation banning the sale of3 WD-ATVs and mandating refunds to purchasers who opted to return thempassed constitutional muster.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As Mr. Killian is on leave you have asked us to review his memorandumin two particulars to ascertain whether his analysis hinges on the consentdecree in <T3>United States</T3> v. <T3>American Honda Motor Co.</T3>, as between being preliminary and permanent,and the absence of any ``vested'' right which might be interfered withby the previously described legislation. Your concern is prompted by thefollowing sentences at pages 6 and 9, respectively, of the mentioned June6 memorandum: ``Thus, the existence of a consent decree, <T3>especially one that has not yet been permanently approved,</T3> wouldnot stand in the way of [the] legislation''; ``In other words, absent theexistence of some <T3>`vested' right</T3> as a result of a final court decision, the existenceof a case pending in court or the existence of a consent decree shouldhave no bearing upon the power of Congress to enact legislation.'' (Emphasisadded.)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Mr. Killian rightly notes at the outset that the resolution of theissues raised by the legislation is not completely free of doubt. Thisgeneral qualification is appropriate both because of the nature of C.R.S._weare not advocates_and the fact that as frequently happens, resolution ofissues is by way of decisions involving analogous situations, in this caseeffective displacement by legislation of court judgments.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">With these reservations as well as the overall qualification thatthere is in this as in many cases room for contrary argument, we are persuadedthat Mr. Killian's general conclusions do not turn on the status of theconsent decree, but clearly would be affected by the presence of some ``vestedright'' which would be cut off by the legislation under consideration.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The noted sentence which appears at page 6 reflects the status ofthe decree at the time of the memorandum's preparation and exp<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>r<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>esses an <T3>a fortiori</T3> proposition, namely, by analogy with a final judgment,if Congress may by law supplant or deplace a permanent judgment, it goeswithout say<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>ing<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> that it may do so with respect to an interim ortemporary one.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As indicated, Mr. Killian leaves no doubt that any interference bythe legislation with a ``vested'' right would affect the analysis. Sincea right of this nature is a property interest protected by the Due ProcessClause of the 5th Amendment against federal interference, a reservationalong these lines_one that appears frequently in the principal decisionsrelied on in Mr. Killian's analysis_is a virtual truism.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In connection with the latter, the crucial question appears to usto be what ``vested'' right if any would be cut off by the legislation.Neither realization of a specific rate of return on an investment nor continuationof a speci<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>f<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>ic course of regulation fall into that category.``Federal regulation of future action based upon rights previously acquiredby the person regulated is not prohibited by the Constitution. So longas the Constitution authorizes the subsequently enacted legislation, thefact that its provisions limit or interfere with previously acquired rightsdoes not condemn it. Immunity from federal regulation is not gained throughforehanded contracts. W<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213>re it otherwise the paramount powers of Congresscould be nullified by `prophetic discernment.' <T3>The rights acquired by judgments have no different standing</T3>.''<T3>Fleming</T3> v. <T3>Rhodes</T3>, 331 U.S. 100, 107 (1947).

The amendedbill clearly eliminates the concerns expressed by the industry about theconstitutionality of the legislation. It does not include a series of findings.It does not interfer<CODE-213>5</CODE-213>e<CODE-213>0</CODE-213> with the consent decree. Indeed, it supplementsthat consent order.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The ban included in the reported bill applies to three wheel ATVsthat are not subject to the consent decree during its term. It requiresthat the CPSC give notice to all manufacturers of three wheel ATVs of theeffect of the ban in the legislation. That notice will presumably advisethe firms that are parties to the consent decree that the ban has no affecton those three wheel ATVs subject to the consent decree.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Most importantly, the legislation fills a void in the consent decree.It requires refunds by all three wheel ATV manufacturers to persons whopurchased these vehicles before the legislation is enacted, provided thatthose purchasers return those vehicles to the manufacturers. The bill directsthe CPSC to issue criteria by regulation governing refunds. The criteriawould require that manufacturers undertake a real and effective effortto notify the past purchasers or users of three wheel ATVs of the refundoption. The regulation will set forth a reasonable, fair and effectiveprocedure for return of the vehicles and the criteria for the refund. Thecriteria shall consider the age and condition of the vehicles and otherrelevant factors, such a depreciation. The intent is fairness and equitywithout windfalls to anyone and the Committee's interest in encouragingowners of these vehicles to return them for their own safety and that ofothers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Refunds can be in cash or the equivalent in credit. Presumably, therefunds would be made by manufacturers through their dealers and that thedealers will be made whole as reasonable under the regulations and thelegislation. The dealers should bear no expense for this refund effort.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Committee expects the CPSC to maintain oversight over the implementationof the regulations to ensure fairness. If the regulations need revision,CPSC is not precluded from making those revisions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The bill deliberately does not provide a time limit on refunds. Thatis left up to the CPSC. We do not know that one is needed. The CPSC shouldconsider this issue consistent with the purpose of the legislation to providesafety. We think, however, that the CPSC should periodically review thestatus and effectiveness of the refund effort. The Committee expects theCPSC to keep us currently and fully informed about the development andpromulgation of the regulations and the actual refund program and otheractions regarding ATVs. Violations by the manufacturers are expected tobe punished by the CPSC.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It is important to note that the bill also requires the CPSC to issuea rule stating that manufacturers of three wheel ATVs should not sell outsidethe United States any three wheel ATV returned to the manufacturer forpurposes of receiving a refund. They should be consigned to the scrap heap.The Committee does not want the manufacturers to visit these safety problemson people in other nations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Other features of the legislation include an extension of the trainingprogram required by the consent decree without affecting the decree itselfand important information for prospective buyers of four wheel ATVs.<CODE-213>1</CODE-213><CODE-213>0</CODE-213><CODE-213>1</CODE-213></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74"><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>Hearings<CODE-213>1</CODE-213></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><CODE-213>0</CODE-213>The Committee's Subcommittee on Commerce, ConsumerProtection, and Competitiveness held one day of hearings on H.R. 3343,a bill to amend the Consumer Product Safety Act and related laws to improvethe performance of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, to authorizeappropriations for that Act, and for other purposes, and the related billH.R. 3443, a bill to establish an Administrator for Consumer Product Safetywithin the Department of Health and Human Services and to transfer thefunctions of the Consumer Product Safety Commission to the Secretary ofHealth and Human Services, and for other purposes, on October 27, 1987.Testimony was received from the Honorable Alfonse D'Amato, United StatesSenate; the Honorable George Miller, Member of Congress; the HonorableLarry E.

Thus, future commercial salesof such three wheel ATVs would be prohibited, but individual, private salesbetween consumers would not be affected. Three wheel ATVs which are notsubject to the consent decree include those whose sale or marketing isnot banned by the consent decree, such as used three wheel ATVs in dealers'inventory and all three wheel ATVs in existence after the expiration ofthe consent decree. futhermore, the sale of three wheel ATVs which aresubject to the consent decree would be a violation of section 19(a)(2)of the CPSA.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Subsection (a)(2) provides that the provisions in subsection (a)(1)would take effect 30 days after enactment.

The Committee also notesthat the administrative regulations should be promulgated under noticeand comment procedures and would not be subject to the specific requirementsof section 9 of the CPSA.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Subsection (c) requires the CPSC to issue two consumer product safetyrules for four wheel all-terrain vehicles. The first rule would requirethe manufacturers and distributors of four wheel ATVs to extend the freetraining program, provided for in the consent decree with the CPSC, toall past purchasers. It also requires that purchasers be provided withstatistics on death and injuries to children under 16 for the prior fiveyear period. The second rule would require appropriate performance standardsand design characteristics for future four wheel ATVs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The subsection specifies the procedure to be followed in promulgatingthe two rules. The Commission is required to publish a notice of proposedrulemaking for the first rule within 45 days and a final rule within 180days. The Commission is required to publish a notice of proposed rulemakingfor the second rule within 120 days and a final rule within one year.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The subsection also clarifies that compliance with a consumer productsafety rule promulgated under this subsection does not relieve any personfrom liability at common law or under state statutory law. This is consistentwith section 25(a) of the CPSA, which applies to consumer product safetyrules issued under the CPSA.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Subsection (d) provides that if after two years after enactment, lessthan one half of the States have enacted a law requiring the licensingof four wheel ATV operators, the safety training of such operators, theuse of helmets by such operators, and a minimum age of 16 for such drivers,then the CPSC shall conduct a study to determine what actions are requiredto impose such requirements or to otherwise protect children from the harmpresented by ATVs. Not later than two years after enactment, the Commissionshall provide an opportunity for public comment on its proposed report.Not later than 2\1/2\ years after enactment, the Commission shall reportthe results to Congress together with the comments received and its policyrecommendations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Subsection (e) provides a definition of ATVs, based on the definitionin the consent decree.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="77">Section 202_Sleepwear</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Section 202 would require the CPSC to conduct a study under the FlammableFabrics Act to determine if a special flammability standard is needed forsleepwear other than children's sleepwear (for which a special standardalready exists). The CPSC must report the results of the study to Congressnot later than one year after the date of enactment. The commission shallspecifically consider the risks and benefits to the elderly.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Committee is aware that the Commission has already done work inthe area of elderly sleepwear flammability. The committee does not intendthis provision to result in a delay in ongoing work. Rather, the Committeeseeks to emphasize the importance of the CPSC's promptly completing workin this area.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Committee is also concerned about the Commission's enforcementof its existing children's sleepwear flammability regulations. The CPSChas promulgated a flammability standard applicable to children's sleepwearsizes 0 to 14, and has issued a set of definitions regarding what qualifiesas children's sleepwear. Evidence indicates that there has been a reductionin the number of children's death since the adoption of the children'ssleepwear standard.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The standard adopted by the CPSC in practical terms means that garmentsmade of 100 percent cotton do not satisfy the standard. It appears thatsome manufacturers, primarily foreign manufacturers, have attempted toevade the standards by producing garments which are for all practical purposessleepwear but which vary in some small way from the standard. These productsare often made from cotton and displayed near complying sleepwear. Consumersthen purchase these garments and do not have the protection provided bythe flammability standard. In addition, since consumers may prefer thegarment made from cotton, these non-complying garments then have a competitiveadvantage over those products which comply with the standard. The CPSChas a policy statement that encourages retailers to segregate garmentsthat comply with the standard from those that do not comply, but that policystatement is often not followed. The Committee strongly urges the CPSCto investigate ways to ensure further adherence to that policy statement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="77">Section 203_Lawn Darts</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Section 203 requires the CPSC to review its existing regulations andexemptions regarding lawn darts to determine if stricter requirements,specifically including a ban, are needed to protect consumers, especiallychildren. The Commission shall report its actions to Congress not laterthan one year after enactment. The Committee's concern is with lawn dartsthat have a potential to cause puncture wounds.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="77">Section 204_Lighters</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Section 204 requires that CPSC to begin regulatory proceedings toestablish a safety standard for cigarette lighters, specifically takinginto account the need to protect children. (In response to this legislation,and a petition to begin a rulemaking proceeding to require disposable lightersto be child-resistant that had been pending since 1985, the Commissionrecently issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on this issue.)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="77">Section 205_Amusement Park Operators</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Section 205 would require the CPSC to conduct a study to determineif a minimum age should be established, under the CPSA, to promote safetyfor riders, for the operator of an amusement park ride. The Commissionshall report to Congress no later than 18 months after enactment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="77">Section 206_Amusement Rides</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Section 206 amends the Consumer Product Safety Act to partially restorethe commission's jurisdiction over fixed site amusement rides.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Subsection (a) adds a new paragraph (15) to section 3(a) of the Actto define ``amusement ride.'' The term includes any device which carriesor conveys passengers over a fixed course within a defined area for purposesof amusing the passengers in the device. The device must be one that iscustomarily controlled or directed by a person who is employed for thepurpose of operating the ride and who is not a consumer with respect tothe device. An amusement ride which is not permanently fixed to a siteis a consumer product for all purposes of the Act. Such rides are typicallyfound in traveling circuses and carnivals. An amusement ride which is permanentlyfixed to a site is not a consumer product for purposes of section 7, 8,14, 15(b), 15(c), and 15(d) of the Act. Thus, the CPSC cannot promulgatesafety standards or bans regarding permanently fixed amusement rides. Thesubsection also adds a new paragraph (16) to section 3(a) of the Act todefine ``amusement ride operator.'' The term means the owner of an amusementride. The subsection also makes a number of technical and conforming changes.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Subsection (b) amends section 6(b) of the Act to make it applicableto public release of information from which the public can readily ascertainthe identity of the amusement ride operator.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Subsection (c) of the bill amends section 15 of the Act to add a newsubsection (h) to require any amusement ride operator who obtains informationwhich indicates that a serious injury occurred during operation of an amusementride the operator owns to inform the CPSC about the occurrence immediately.Serious injury is defined as trauma or other injury which actually resultsin death or a bone fracture or which requires overnight hospitalizationor which typically requires overnight hospitalization. The subsection alsoauthorizes the CPSC to order the amusement ride to cease operating untilit is repaired if the agency determines (after affording interested parties,including consumers and consumer organizations, opportunity for a hearingin accordance with section 15(f) of the Act) that an amusement ride thathas been involved in a serious injury, or is mechanically identical toa ride involved in a serious injury, presents a substantial product hazardand that corrective action is in the public interest.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Subsection (d) of the bill amends section 16(a) of the Act to providethat officers and employees duly designated by the CPSC may inspect, atreasonable times and in a reasonable manner, fixed site amusement ridesif the ride was involved in a serious injury or is mechanically identicalto a ride involved in a serious injury, including investigating the causeof the serious injury in which the ride was involved and to test the safetyof the ride. Such inspections must be commenced and completed with reasonablepromptness.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Subsection (e) requires the CPSC to issue regulations for the administrationof section 15, as amended by subsection (c) of this section. Such regulationsmust be promulgated within six months after the effective date.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Subsection (f) provides that the amendments made by this section willtake effect January 1, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="77">Secton 207_Indoor Air Pollutants</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Section 207 would require the CPSC to report to Congress on its activitiesto reduce exposure of individuals to various indoor air pollutants.
