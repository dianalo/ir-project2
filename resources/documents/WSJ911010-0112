The company's current 4400 system, which is responsiblefor the company's growth over the past four years, can storeand retrieve about 6,000 cartridge data tapes much in the waya jukebox plays records. Storage Technology claims to haveabout 90% of the market for such cartridge libraries.</LP><TEXT>   In a presentation to 600 company customers at its annualusers' group meeting, Storage Technology said it plans tointroduce a lower-capacity, lower-cost library system and thenext generation of its current 4400 automated cartridgesystem in 1993. The smaller systems, which will hold as fewas 500 cartridges, will be designed for users with less needfor storage. The next generation of the 4400 system isexpected to include new robotics and be faster than thecurrent offering.   Also in 1993, the company said it plans to roll out asystem using 36-track tapes, instead of the 18-track industrystandard, making the system the fastest cartridge tape systemavailable. The company said the system, code-namedTimberLine, will provide a platform for a system to beintroduced in 1994 that reads tapes at an angle, instead ofup and down. The system, code-named RedWood, will be able tostore as much as 100 times more data per cartridge thancurrent cartridges, but won't be as quick to accessinformation. Storage Technology said the systems are expectedto be used for storing such data as Social Security files,land-title records, engineering files and historical files,which could include tremendous amounts of information butdon't have to be accessed often.   Ryal Poppa, Storage Technology chairman and chiefexecutive officer, said the company described the systems forits customers to give them time to write software andorganize their data to use the equipment, a process that hesaid can take as long as two years.   Although the focus of the meeting was on tape systems, Mr.Poppa said in an interview that the company is on schedule tointroduce its high-speed disk array in January and to beginshipping the machines in volume in midyear. The drives willuse stacks of smaller disks to store data and promise topreserve data even if some disks fail.</TEXT></DOC>
