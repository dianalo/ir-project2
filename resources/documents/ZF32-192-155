US District Court of LosAngeles Judge Terrence Watter ruled that when Ashton-Tate appliedfor the software copyright on dBASE it did not credit the JetPropulsion Laboratory for its contribution, which invalidated thecompany's suit against Fox Software.andP;  Ashton-Tate claims that thelawyer applying for the copyright was not aware of the earlierwork done by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory; the company plans toappeal the decision by Watter.andP;  There is no precedent for thedecision in the software industry, so the appeal may overturn thedecision, but the software industry should learn from the casethat little mistakes can have very large financial impacts.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Company:   Ashton-Tate Corp.

 Following class discussion of each case in the coursebook, the professor would ask: &quot;What might the losing side have donedifferently to change the court's mind?&quot;andP;  In examining any court ruling, it'sworth considering what the loser might have done differently.andM;In the case of Ashton-Tate vs.andP;  Fox Software, the answer might well besomething like the old saw, &quot;Give credit where credit is due.&quot;andP;  You remember.andO;Ashton-Tate accused Fox of software copyright infringement on its dBASE IIIPlus product.andM;In dismissing the case, Judge Terrence Watter of the U.S.andP;  District Court inLos Angeles ruled that when Ashton-Tate applied for the software copyright ondBASE, it had failed to credit the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for its originalcontribution.andP;  Because of that failure, said the court, Ashton-Tate'scopyright infringement suit against Fox was invalid.andM;When silence is fraudulentandM;As the case brought out, dBASE is derived, at least in part, from apublic-domain program created at the Laboratory years before Ashton-Tate'scopyright application.andP;  Not mentioning a prior work on the copyrightregistration form is considered an act of fraud on the Copyright Office andinvalidates the copyright on the &quot;derivative&quot; work.andM;Ashton-Tate claims that the lawyer who applied for the copyright was unawareof the earlier work; &quot;an oversight&quot; the company insists.andP;  Ashton-Tate said itwould appeal Watter's ruling.andP;  Oversight or no, Ashton-Tate's improperlyregistered copyright for dBASE has to be the computer world's most notoriouslegal gaffe of recent months.andM;The law is rife with details that are easily overlooked.andP;  But such an errorcan have massive consequences, as Ashton-Tate has learned.andP;  The company'shammer lock on the powerful, lucrative dBASE standard is in jeopardy.andM;Judge Watter's decision may be the first of its kind in the softwarecopyright field.andP;  Whether the decision will be sustained on appeal is atoss-up, given the lack of precedent and the enormous cost to Ashton-Tate oflosing the copyright ownership of its most important product.andP;  The lessonhere should not be lost on anyone: In the software industry, little mistakescan carry very big price tags.andM;In the excitement and thrill of creating a new product, we sometimes tend tooverlook the mundane details, such as attribution of sources.andP;  Whenever youcreate a new program that is based on or uses source code from a priorprogram, you have what is known as a &quot;derivative work.&quot;andP;  If you seek toregister your new program with the copyright office, it will want to knowabout any prior works your new product is derived from to ensure that youdon't obtain a valid copyright by infringing upon a prior work.andM;Other mistakesandM;Another copyright buzzword you'll hear from time to time is &quot;fair use.&quot;andP;  Fairuse allows a library, a classroom teacher or book reviewer to transcribeportions of a copyrighted work for purely educational purposes.andP;  Fair use,should never be relied upon to justify copying an existing program for resalein an otherwise original work.andP;  Fair use might allow a computer scienceteacher to reproduce source code listings as a learning tool, for example,but that would not allow students to then incorporate that source code into acommercial product.andM;Your copyright does not protect trade secrets embodied in the program.andP;  Tradesecrets are an entirely separate matter, and separate steps must be taken toprotect them.andP;  Merely registering your program copyright won't legallyprotect trade secrets and, in fact, can inadvertently destroy your tradesecrets--if you don't take precautions in submitting the registration.andM;Virtually every business tends to be careless where legal matters areconcerned, especially where copyrights are involved.andP;  Copyright law iscomplex and rapidly changing, and it can be disastrous to take things forgranted, as Ashton-Tate so aptly demonstrated for the rest of us.andP;  If youignore everything else about the law as it affects your business, payattention to copyright matters.andM;What's yours is yoursandM;Another copyright problem are involves the idea of a &quot;work for hire,&quot;discussed earlier (see SYSTEMS INTEGRATION, November 1990, Page 31).andP;  Torecapitulate, &quot;work for hire&quot; arises when the work is created by a bona fideemployee (you pay withholding, SSI, unemployment and worker's compensationinsurance) or is ordered or commissioned as part of a collective work.andM;While any or all of the rights granted under a copyright may be sold off orlicensed to another party, a recent amendment to the copyright law allows theowner to prohibit purchasers from renting copies to others.andP;  The idea is thatthe copyright owner has the exclusive right to determine how the work will beexploited and by whom.andM;Joel B. Gilman is an attorney in Seattle with 10 years experience as atechnical write in the computer industry.andP;  He represents a number of systemsintegrators, resellers and software publishers in contract and copyrightmatters.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
