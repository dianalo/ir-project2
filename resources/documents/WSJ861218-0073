Brewer andamp; Co., to a group led by the unit's chief executive officer for about $200 million.    IU said the sale of the Honolulu-based producer of sugar, macadamia nuts, guava, coffee, spices and fertilizer completes a broad restructuring and debt-reduction effort begun in 1978. The diversified services company said it had reduced its debt as of Sept. 30 to $154.2 million from more than $1.2 billion in 1978. It expects to have surplus cash with the proceeds of the C. Brewer sale.    John W.A. Buyers, C. Brewer's chief executive since 1975, heads the leveraged-buyout group of the unit's senior officers and directors, and private investors. In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company largely with debt that ultimately is paid with funds generated by the acquired company. </TEXT></DOC>
