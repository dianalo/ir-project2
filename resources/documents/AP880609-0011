It is, of course, Glenn who best fits his own description forthe second spot on the national ticket with probable nomineeMichael Dukakis. And many Democratic insiders agree that the firstAmerican to orbit the Earth would be a good choice.   ``He's on everybody's short list and ought to be,'' Democraticparty chief Paul Kirk told a Chicago fund-raising audience recentlyas he introduced Glenn.   Even Jesse Jackson's campaign manager, Gerald Austin, puts Glennon his VP list, right behind Jackson.   ``It's a great American story. You take Mike Dukakis, son ofGreek immigrants, and John Glenn, a small-town boy who married hischildhood sweetheart, a woman who overcame a stuttering problem _and then Glenn goes on to be the world's most famous astronaut anda U.S. senator,'' said Austin, an Ohio political consultant.   And a recent California poll provides another argument forGlenn, who hails from New Concord, Ohio.   Dukakis led Bush without any mention of a running mate by 13points in mid-May. But with Gov. George Deukmejian on the GOPticket, it was an even race.   Except against Dukakis and Glenn. That Democratic ticket bestedthe home-state choice in California by 10 percentage points.   Glenn's office declined a request for an interview to discussthe possibility of the No. 2 spot on the ticket.   So why won't Dukakis pick Glenn, who will celebrate his 67thbirthday on the day the Democratic National Convention opens inAtlanta on July 18?   One big reason is 1984.   Glenn sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 1984, aneffort that was, by even his own account, a disaster.   ``I humiliated my family, gained 16 pounds and went over $2.5million in debt. Outside of that, it was a great experience,''Glenn said last year in assessing his 1984 performance.   Glenn was judged the top opponent to former Vice PresidentWalter Mondale for the 1984 nomination. But a campaign torn bydissention and lackluster performances on the stump by thecandidate brought a quick end to the bid before spring.   Even if the memories of 1984 fade, the debt hasn't.   The campaign still owes about $2.4 million to vendors and tofour Ohio banks, more than four years later. And much of that timehas been spent fighting with the Federal Election Commission overthe legality of the loans. That battle was settled last year with apromise by the campaign to pay $4,000 to the FEC.   With Dukakis emphasizing his own management of fiscal policy andhis legendary tight-fisted personal habits, Glenn's debt might be aproblem.   What most Americans remember about Glenn comes not from 1984,but from 1962.   That year the Marine Corps pilot was the first American to orbitthe Earth, blasting off from Cape Canaveral aboard the Mercurycapsule, Friendship 7, on a journey that moved the nation firmlyback into the space race.   Glenn returned to ticker-tape parades and the adulation of anation that had been shaken by Soviet successes in space.   He returned to Ohio to enter politics in his home state, butsuccess eluded him. He failed in Senate bids in 1964 and 1970,before winning a bitterly contested primary against HowardMetzenbaum in 1974 and going on to Capitol Hill.   The retired Marine Corps officer has followed a moderatelyliberal course in the Senate, focusing intensely on one or twoissues, too intensely critics have said. But he has been theSenate's expert on efforts to stop the spread of nuclear weapons toother countries.   His record on military matters has not been one of unquestioningsupport for the Pentagon. Glenn supported the B-1 bomber strongly,but opposed the MX missile. He backed production of binary nervegas weapons, but opposed aid to the Nicaraguan Contras.   Through his career, he has had moderately high ratings fromliberal groups such as the Americans for Democratic Action andmoderately low marks from conservative groups such as the AmericanConservative Union.   And he argues that such a middle path is the winning choice forthe party in the general election.   ``The Democratic Party should pursue a reasoned and a middlecourse,'' Glenn says. ``If our agenda is the nation's agenda, thenrank-and-file Americans will come home to the Democratic Party. Ibelieve we can and should be the party of ... the sensible center.''</TEXT></DOC>
