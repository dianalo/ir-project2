WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   At the prestigious corner of Friedrichstrasse andUnter den Linden in East Berlin stands the Soviet-bloc's only hotelto earn Western recognition as one of the world's most luxurious.   But the Grand Hotel's 350 plush rooms and apartments areavailable only to the carriers of convertible currencies, such asdollars, and few East Europeans will brave the doormen's steelystares for a peek at the opulent Art Nouveau lobby.   Like all businesses in East Germany, the government is the ownerand as such can smooth more than the sheets for its most valuedclients.   The hotel's shiny black Mercedes limousines are virtually wavedthrough border controls while other Western travelers are forced toline up for the lengthy ordeal of passport checks and currencydeclarations.   Hotel staff can settle the details with the Foreign Ministrylater.   Likewise, with a mere signature, they can they arrange a visaextension or Western bank transfer _ tasks that through the normalbureaucracy can take hours.   The Grand opened in August 1987 and last year earned thedesignation by the New York-based Leading Hotels association as oneof the 200 best hotels in the world.   Its emergence typifies the kind of turnkey business deal EastGermany wants with the West.   While Soviet, Polish and Hungarian companies have been pressingfor Western cooperation to develop and share new hard-currencysources, like tourist facilities, East Berlin's authorities areresistant to sharing control or profit.   ``We have not been riding this fashionable wave of activity overjoint ventures,'' said the Grand's deputy director, Hartmut Kaske.``Those countries running hotels and other businesses under jointventures with the West do so out of economic necessity. We are notthat weak.''   Financing for construction of the hotel was arranged by theJapanese company Kojima, which built the Grand. The East Germangovernment has paid off the loan, and the hotel's profits arechanneled to it as reimbursement.   Kaske said in an interview the hotel will have paid for itselfwithin 10 years, although its occupancy rate of less than 40percent is well below that considered a break-even point forWestern hotels.   The hotel draws mostly businessmen and prominent visitors withits rates ranging from the equivalent of $150 a night for thesmallest single room to $2,000 for one of the two penthouse suites.   All 800 employees are East Germans, who are paid significantlyless than Western workers in similar jobs. The national average forpersonal income is about $600 a month, and most consumer servicejobs pay well below the average.   Gudrun Goslar, the hotel's public relations director, saysexclusivity is part of the Grand's attraction for the Westernbusinessmen who make up about 80 percent of the guest list.   ``It would be foolish to condemn what is available here justbecause some people can't afford it,'' she remarked during a tourof the luxury suites with private saunas and hand-made porcelainlamps.   East German officials make no apologies over the luxury providedfor the Westerners in contrast with the austere accommodationsavailable for East Germans.   ``We built this hotel to be able to offer a good product on theinternational market,'' Kaske said. ``We operate on the oldcapitalist principle that when the customer is happy, he buysmore.''   He said much of the initiative to build a luxury hotel in EastBerlin came from the foreign trade officials whose Westerncounterparts had complained of poor accommodation.   While the Grand Hotel is uniquely lavish for a communistenterprise, with a 340-label wine list and an indoor orange grovefor communing with nature, guests can still find a few reminders ofwhich side of the border they are sleeping on.   Dialing direct to Western cities is possible, but the fewinternational telephone lines available are frequently engaged forhours.   Tuxedoed security men stand guard throughout the seven-tieratrium lobby, but a few hard-currency prostitutes are allowed in tothe polished bars and dimly lit salons.   Accompanying the full breakfast delivered to rooms on whitelinen is an imported exotic flower but a dull morning newspaper,the Communist Party's Berliner Zeitung.   A West German businessman who did not want to be named said hestays at the Grand Hotel several times a year ``because it's theclosest thing to civilization one can find here.''   He added that the hotel was very comfortable, ``but goingoutside is a little like waking up from a good dream.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Fri AMs, May 26</NOTE></DOC>
