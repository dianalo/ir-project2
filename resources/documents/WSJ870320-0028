In a news briefing, Mr. Herrington said that &quot;a reasonable&quot; proposal to restore the oil-depletion allowance would involve only new oil wells and wells using &quot;enhanced recovery&quot; methods to get oil that is particularly hard to extract.    He said this limited 27.5% annual depletion allowance, which excludes old wells, would cost the Treasury $200 million in net tax revenue each year. He said other estimates, ranging from $2 billion in a recent Department of Energy report to $7 billion in industry estimates, were too high.    One department official said an explanation for the difference in the estimates may be that Mr. Herrington was using a net figure, taking into account that increasing domestic production would generate other taxable revenue, rather than the gross cost of the depletion allowance.    Mr. Herrington said the depletion allowance is just one of several options -- aimed at increasing domestic oil production and reducing imports -- that may be discussed at a White House domestic policy meeting today.    He said that although the White House was &quot;cool&quot; to the idea of altering tax laws after last year's big tax bill, an Energy Department report released this week may force the Reagan administration and Congress to look at the proposal seriously. The report said that increased reliance on oil imports presents a threat to U.S. national security interests.    The oil-depletion allowance permitted companies to deduct 27.5% of the value of oil produced from wells until 1975. Major oil companies lost the break in 1975, and the allowance for independent producers has fallen to 15% since then. </TEXT></DOC>
