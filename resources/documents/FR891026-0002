These regulations, 10 CFR part 51, subpart A, reflectthe Commission's policy of developing regulations voluntarily subject tocertain conditions to take account of the regulations of the Council onEnvironmental Quality (CEQ) implementing the procedural provisions of NEPA.Section 51.14(b) of the NRC regulations adopts certain definitions usedin the CEQ regulations. These definitions include the definition of ``MajorFederal action'' in 40 CFR 1508.18.\1\<NOTE/> As this definition makes clear, for NEPA purposes, the term``Major Federal action'' does not include ``* * * bringing judicial oradministrative civil or criminal enforcement actions * * *.'' This portionof the CEQ definition of ``Major Federal action'' is highlighted in andSection;51.10 of the Commission's regulations which addresses the purpose and scopeof NRC's regulations implementing section 102(2) of NEPA and states inparagraph (d):<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ 40 CFR 1508.18 states: `` `Major Federal action' includesactions with effects that may be major and which are potentially subjectto Federal control and responsibility. Major reinforces but does not havea meaning independent of significantly (andSection; 1508.27). Actions includethe circumstance where the responsible officials fail to act and that failureto act is reviewable by courts or administrative tribunals under the AdministrativeProcedure Act or other applicable law as agency action.<ITAG tagnum="28">``(a) Actions include new and continuing activities, including projectsand programs entirely or partly financed, assisted, conducted, regulated,or approved by federal agencies; new or revised agency rules, regulations,plans, policies, or procedures; and legislative proposals (andSection;andSection;1506.8, 1508.17). Actions do not include funding assistance solely in theform of general revenue sharing funds, distributed under the State andLocal Fiscal Assistance Act of 1972, 31 U.S.C. 1221 et seq., with no Federalagency control over the subsequent use of such funds. Actions do not includebringing judicial or administrative civil or criminal enforcement actions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">``(b) Federal actions tend to fall within one of the following categories:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">``(1) Adoption of official policy, such as rules, regulations, andinterpretations adopted pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, 5U.S.C. 551 et seq.; treaties and international conventions or agreements;formal documents establishing an agency's policies which will result inor substantially alter agency programs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">``(2) Adoption of formal plans, such as official documents preparedor approved by federal agencies which guide or prescribe alternative usesof federal resources, upon which future agency actions will be based.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">``(3) Adoption of programs, such as a group of concerted actions toimplement a specific policy or plan; systematic and connected agency decisionsallocating agency resources to implement a specific statutory program orexecutive directive.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">``(4) Approval of specific projects, such as construction or managementactivities located in a defined geographic area. Projects include actionsapproved by permit or other regulatory decision as well as federal andfederally assisted activities.'' </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(d) Commission actions initiating or relating to administrative orjudicial civil or criminal enforcement actions or proceedings are not subjectto section 102(2) of NEPA. These actions include issuance of notices, orders,and denials of requests for action pursuant to subpart B of part 2 of thischapter, and matters covered by part 15 and 160 of this chapter.</ITAG>Although the Commission's regulations make clear that enforcement mattersare not subject to the NEPA process, there has been some uncertainty asto whether certain types of informal administrative actions used by theNRC staff as an adjunct to the Commission's formal enforcement mechanisms,which include the issuance of orders pursuant to 10 CFR part 2, subpartB, are intended to be included within the scope of 10 CFR 51.10(d). <T3>See</T3> 10 CFR part 2, Appendix C, General Statement of Policy andProcedure for NRC Enforcement Actions, section V.H. These informal administrativeactions include, among others, various written notices such as bulletins,information notices, generic letters, notices of deviation or non-conformanceand confirmatory action letters. As use of the word ``include'' in thesecond sentence of andSection; 51.10(d) makes clear, andSection; 51.10(d) doesnot purport to provide a comprehensive list of Commission activities relatingto enforcement. The types of enforcement actions mentioned were intendedto be only illustrative. As described in the Commission's General Statement of Policy on Enforcement,``Confirmatory Action Letters are letters confirming a licensee's or avendor's agreement to take certain actions to remove significant concernsabout health and safety, safeguards, or the environment.'' A confirmatoryaction letter is an informal enforcement tool issued by the NRC staff pursuantto 10 CFR part 2, Appendix C, V, H, 3. The letter memorializes commitmentsmade by the licensee to the NRC staff that the licensee will take certainspecific actions with regard to a facility. The NEPA status of such informal tools, including resumption of plant operation,was not explicitly addressed in andSection; 51.10 since the Commission believed,as it argued in <T3>Commonwealth of Massachusetts</T3> v. <T3>United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission,</T3> No. 88-2211, thatsuch informal enforcement tools did not involve agency action. However,in that case the First Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that resumptionof operation of the Pilgrim facility, after an extended shutdown for correctiveactions reflected in a Confirmatory Action Letter, involved NRC actionto reinstate the license. The Court went on to uphold the NRC actions againstrelated challenges. The case did not raise and the Court did not addressany NEPA related issues. Licensee actions undertaken voluntarily, as documented in a confirmatoryaction letter, are generally directed to restoring compliance with NRCregulations, thereby enabling the licensee to resume licensed activities.Consequently, the only environmental effects of the licensee's voluntaryactions to reestablish that licensed activities will be undertaken in accordancewith the license are those evaluated at the time the facility or activitywas licensed and assessed in the NRC Environmental Impact Statement preparedin connection with the initial issuance of the license and in subsequentenvironmental evaluations in connection with license amendments. The environmentaleffects of NRC activities associated with the supervision of such licenseeactions, including NRC approval and supervision of the licensee's subsequentresumption of licensed activities are the same and do not require additionalenvironmental review. Although the Commission did not intend andSection; 51.10(d) of its NEPA regulationsto be read as if it applied exclusively to the types of enforcement activitiesspecifically enumerated therein, it recognizes that clarification wouldbe helpful. Accordingly, the Commission is promulgating this final rule.It should be clearly understood that it has always been contemplated, underandSection; 51.10(d), that when licensee actions to remediate the mattersunderlying the enforcement action have been completed to the satisfactionof the Commission, the conditions of operation previously reviewed in anenvironmental context will be restored. Accordingly, when the NRC authorizeslicensed activities to resume, no additional environmental review pursuantto NEPA or the Commission's regulations is needed. If it should be necessaryfor the licensee to obtain a license amendment to restore compliance withthe Commission's safety requirements in order to satisfy the concerns underlyingthe enforcement action, any environmental effects associated with issuanceof the license amendment would either be addressed in an EnvironmentalAssessment or encompassed by a categorical exclusion under 10 CFR 51.22(c).In this way, appropriate consideration of any environmental impact wouldbe assured. Because this amendment is merely clarifying and interpretative in nature,relates solely to matters of agency practice and does not involve a significantquestion of policy, good cause exists for omitting notice of proposed rulemakingand public procedures thereon as unnecessary and for making the amendmenteffective upon publication in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>without the customary thirty day notice. <ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Impact: Categorical Exclusion </ITAG>The NRC has determined that this final rule is the type of action describedin categorical exclusion 10 CFR 51.22(c)(2). Therefore, neither an environmentalimpact statement nor an environmental assessment has been prepared forthis final regulation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act Statement </ITAG>This final rule contains no new or amended information collection requirementsand therefore is not subject to the requirements of the Paperwork ReductionAct of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Analysis </ITAG>Questions have arisen as to whether 10 CFR 51.10(d), which excludes Commissionactions relating to enforcement from the NEPA process, encompasses informaladministrative actions such as those described in section V.H. of the Commission'sGeneral Statement of Policy and Procedure for NRC Enforcement Actions,10 CFR part 2, Appendix C, <T3>i.e.</T3>, bulletins, information notices, generic letters, noticesof deviation or nonconformance and confirmatory action letters. Section51.10(d) of the Commission's regulations is not limited to a portion ofthe Commission's enforcement activities but is all-inclusive. The NRC staffhas a need to assure a uniform understanding of the scope of actions encompassedby this regulation. This rule change revising the text of andSection;  51.10(d)to make clear that it applies to the entire spectrum of the Commission'senforcement activities is the appropriate means to achieve this end. <ITAG tagnum="84">Backfit Analysis </ITAG>The NRC has determined that the backfit rule, 10 CFR 50.109, does not applyto this final rule because this amendment to 10 CFR 51.10(d) does not containany provisions which impose backfits as defined in 10 CFR 50.109(a)(1)and therefore a backfit analysis is not required. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 10 CFR Part 51 </ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Environmental impact statement,Nuclear materials, Nuclear power plants and reactors, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements.For the reasons set forth in the preamble and under the authority of theAtomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, the Energy Reorganization Act of1974, as amended, the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended,and 5 U.S.C. 552 and 533, the NRC is adopting the following amendment to10 CFR part 51: <ITAG tagnum="56">PART 51_ ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION REGULATIONS FOR DOMESTIC LICENSINGAND RELATED REGULATORY FUNCTIONS </ITAG>1.
