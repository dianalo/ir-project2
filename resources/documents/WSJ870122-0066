As previously reported, industry sources say American plans to split a $2.4 billion order for wide-body aircraft between Boeing and Airbus, a move unusual in the airline industry. The sources have said that instead of buying the jets, American would acquire the planes under a lease arrangement that would make it possible to return the planes to the manufacturers on short notice.    Industry sources said yesterday that they expect American to announce the split order later this month. </TEXT></DOC>
