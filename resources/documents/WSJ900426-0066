Dayton Hudson, which last week agreed to buy Field's fromB.A.T Industries PLC for $1.04 billion, had been expected tocombine some operations once the acquisition is completed.</LP><TEXT>   In meetings with Field's employees yesterday and inletters distributed to the staff, Dayton Hudson executivessaid they would maintain a regional office in Chicago tofocus on &quot;customer service and community involvement.&quot; Thecompany said other central office functions, such asmerchandise buying, would be handled through its departmentstore unit in Minneapolis.   &quot;We know the merchandising functions will get consolidatedright away -- after closing,&quot; a spokeswoman said. &quot;The restof it will take place over a period going into fall, probablyOctober.&quot;   The spokeswoman said she didn't know how many of Field's1,700 central office staffers will lose their jobs, althoughsome will be offered positions in Minneapolis. Field'semployees at its warehouses and its 24 stores aren't affectedby the consolidation.   Still uncertain is the fate of Philip B. Miller, the chiefexecutive officer of Field's who led an unsuccessful bid forthe chain. Mr. Miller, who is widely credited with turningaround the chain, isn't expected to stay, because he wouldlikely lose his autonomy. Spokeswomen for Dayton Hudson andField's would say only that discussions are continuingbetween Mr. Miller and the new owner.</TEXT></DOC>
