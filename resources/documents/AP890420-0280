Meanwhile, platinum and palladium prices surged on the New YorkMercantile Exchange on renewed speculative buying linked to recentnuclear-fusion experiments.   On other markets, petroleum prices were broadly mixed; wheatprices fell while most other grains and soybeans advanced; andlivestock and meat futures were mixed.   Gold settled $2.20 to $2.60 higher with the contract fordelivery in June at $389.30 a troy ounce; silver was 2.2 cents to2.6 cents higher with May at $5.787 a troy ounce.   The rise in gold and silver prices corresponded with a drop inthe dollar's value against other major currencies followingincreases of 0.5 percent in the West German discount rate and WestGermany's equivalent of the prime lending rate.   Currency traders responded to the increased lending rates bybuying West German marks and selling U.S. dollars. A weaker dollarpromotes foreign purchases of U.S. goods, which helps the U.S.economy and could lead to higher inflation in this country.   Gold and silver are generally viewed as investment hedgesagainst inflation, so demand for the metals tends to rise and fallwith inflationary expectations.   A sharp increase in crude-oil and unleaded gasoline prices alsofanned inflation fears and contributed to gold's rally, analystssaid.   Peter Cardillo, commodities trading adviser with Josephthal andamp;Co. in New York, said gold's chart patterns indicated a bullishtrend in the making. He noted that gold for June delivery hadbottomed out at $385.70 an ounce on Wednesday and $385.80 an ounceon Thursday, indicating the market was unlikely to fall below thatarea.   ``We've formed a good bottom here and I think this market isgetting ready to surprise everyone,'' Cardillo said.   Jitters about cold-fusion research persisted in the platinum andpalladium markets. Both metals have been used in recent experimentsin which scientists claim to have recreated in a jar of water thenuclear reaction that powers the sun and stars.   Platinum settled $6.70 to $8.20 higher with July at $556.20 atroy ounce; palladium was $7.80 higher across the board with Juneat $174.85 a troy ounce.   Crude-oil and unleaded gasoline futures rose sharply on the NewYork Merc on supply fears linked to the shutdown of a North Sea oilrig Tuesday following an explosion.   Heating oil futures prices fell, though, reflecting expectationsfor more spring-like weather in the northeastern United States.   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 1 cent lower to 47cents higher with June at $21.28 a barrel; heating oil was was .40cent to 1.04 cents lower with May at 52.29 cents a gallon; unleadedgasoline was .75 cent lower to 1.13 cents higher with May at 74.64cents a gallon.   Wheat futures moved lower on the Chicago Board of Tradefollowing a National Weather Service forecast for above-averageprecipitation next week in the wheat fields of Kansas.   Corn futures finished little changed while oats and soybeanswere slightly higher, reflecting conflicting weather forecasts forthe Midwest, where spring planting is beginning.   Wheat settled 2{ cents to 4 cents lower with the contract fordelivery in May at $4.09\ a bushel; corn was { cent lower to } centhigher with May at $2.72} a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 2{ centshigher with May at $1.98 a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent lower to 5cents higher with May at $7.47{ a bushel.   Cattle futures finished mostly higher on firmer cash markets andperceptions that Wednesday's steep losses were overdone.   Frozen pork bellies fell to new life-of-contract lows for thesecond consecutive day amid expectations that Friday's monthly coldstorage report from the Agriculture Department will show recordlevels of bellies in the nation's commercial freezers.   Live cattle settled .05 cent lower to .55 cent higher with Juneat 71.05 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent lower to .25cent higher with May at 75.62 cents a pound; live hogs were .43cent lower to .15 cent higher with June at 45.47 cents a pound;frozen pork bellies were .65 cent lower to .05 cent higher with Mayat 30.95 cents a pound.</TEXT></DOC>
