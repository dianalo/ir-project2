(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The state Senate acted Monday to stemaccidental shootings that have killed or wounded seven children thismonth, passing a bill that could imprison gun owners who don'tsecure their weapons.   The bill, approved 32-4 in a special session, sets a maximumpenalty of five years in prison and a $5,000 fine for adultviolators.   But the measure sponsored by Republican Sen. John Grant wasweakened by amendments that lowered the age of a minor from 18 to 16and exempted guns kept in automobiles and unloaded firearms.   ``We think by highlighting the responsibility to keep a loadedgun away from children, we're going to save a lot of lives,'' Gov.Bob Martinez said before the Senate acted.   ``The Legislature felt it needed to do something so that youfolks would shut up,'' National Rifle Association spokeswoman MarionHammer told reporters after the Senate vote.   The shootings this month led Martinez to include gun safety in aspecial session of the Legislature, which was originally calledmainly to debate a turnpike building plan.   Hammer, whose organization has blocked efforts to toughenFlorida's liberal gun laws in recent years, called the Senate bill``phony, unreal and a disservice to the people of Florida,'' butsaid the NRA was satisfied with it.   In the House, seven gun safety bills were filed forconsideration, and three of those were assigned to committeehearings scheduled for Tuesday.   One of the three measures could result in a five-year prison termif a child is killed or maimed by an unattended weapon.   The bill by Republican Rep. Harry Jennings would also make it amisdemeanor to leave a firearm accessible to a child.   The measure passed in the House during the recently completedregular session, but the Senate didn't take it up, making itnecessary for the bill to be reconsidered.   A second measure by Democratic Rep. Susan Guber would punishanyone selling or furnishing a weapon to an unsupervised minorwithout parental permission, and requires gun owners to keep theirfirearms locked and unloaded. It exempts stolen guns.   The third measure, by Democratic Rep. Brian Rush, would requiregun stores to post signs warning gun owners about leaving loadedweapons within reach of children.   To become law, a bill must be passed by both the House and theSenate, then be signed by the governor.   The session followed the death Saturday night of 4-year-oldSilvio Claud Pierre at Tampa General Hospital, where he had been incritical condition after shooting himself at his home June 11.   Silvio found a handgun under a couch while his mother was in theshower. His father was out.   Five days earlier, a 10-year-old Orlando boy was killed by aplaymate. Six days earlier, an 8-year-old Miramar girl was killed byher 10-year-old brother who thought his father's gun was unloaded.   Four children ranging in age from 4 to 16 were wounded inseparate accidental shootings this month.</TEXT></DOC>
