Smaller markets were about equally divided between winners and losers.    In Tokyo, share prices closed lower in slow trading as a correction begun Monday quickened its pace.    The Nikkei index of 225 selected issues, which eased 10.99 points Monday, fell 150.85 to close at 25465.73. The Tokyo Stock Exchange's first section index, which fell 1.19 Monday, declined 13.98 to close at 2094.00. First section volume was estimated at 800 million shares, down from 850 million shares Monday.    Traders generally welcomed the correction, which follows a two-week period of almost daily gains.    &quot;It's optimistic in a way,&quot; said one dealer, &quot;because although we're down, we're not down severely. People stayed on the sidelines, as opposed to piling in. There's still a lot of strength behind the market.&quot;    &quot;The feeling in the market is that this is a natural correction that was badly needed,&quot; said another trader.    Traders said retailers were the only sector posting significant gains. One trader said the retailers were higher in part on perceptions that the sector lagged behind the market during the recent rally. Daiei rose 60 yen to close 1,880 yen ($14.75), while Seven-Eleven Japan gained 100 to 7,600.    Trading in heavy industrial and steel issues continued to be brisk, but most closed with moderate losses. Nippon Steel fell 5 to close at 436, while Kawasaki Steel slipped 3 to 378.    Electrical stocks were lower early in the morning session in response to a decline for the dollar of about a yen overnight, but trimmed their losses as the dollar remained steady at its lower levels in Tokyo dealings.    Wednesday in Tokyo, the Nikkei index rose 103.62 in the morning session to stand at 25569.35 at midday.    Share prices in London finished lower after Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher ruled out an early cut in bank base lending rates.    Participants' attention once again was dominated by the pound's strength on foreign exchange markets. Volume was light in most shares.    The Financial Times 30-share index was down 5.1 points at 1457.7. Volume was slightly higher at 420.9 million shares, up from 404.8 million Monday. The 100-share index was down 3.2 points at 1815.0.    The 100 index moved down as much as 9.4 points in response to Mrs. Thatcher's statements, but then recovered somewhat on the strength of early gains on Wall Street.    Equities opened mixed and traded narrowly through the morning as sentiment was hurt by the Bank of England's allowing the pound to break above its unofficial cap at 3 West German marks. Dealers said sterling's strength caused concern about the competitiveness of British exports.    Sterling's strength hit international-oriented issues. Imperial Chemical Industries fell 13 pence to #10.55 ($19.10), and Glaxo Holdings was down 12 at #10.62.    Some pharmaceutical stocks were higher. Beecham jumped 8 pence to 485 ($8.75). The company has scheduled a news conference Friday to announce the results of clinical tests of a new heart drug. Fisons rose 6 to 262 following a news report of successful U.S. clinical trials of its pentamidine inhaler. The inhaler is used to combat pneumonias associated with acquired immune deficiency syndrome.    Share prices also eased in moderate trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.    Dealers said the lower dollar pressured stock prices, while profit-taking eliminated most of the gains made Monday.    Dealers said Tuesday's session started with light volume, which tapered off toward the close. A few foreign investors were seen on the selling side, but they didn't dominate, dealers said.    The dollar fell to 1.6724 marks at the Frankfurt foreign exchange fixing from 1.6860 marks Monday.    The lower dollar depressed export-dependent stocks such as auto makers, dealers said. Bayerische Motoren Werke lost 7 marks to close at 517 ($307), while Volkswagen fell 9.4 to 237.3.    Profit-taking pushed down the stock of machinery maker Kloeckner-Humboldt-Deutz 8 to 96, eliminating most of its gain Monday. Linde, another machinery maker, eased 6 to 567.    Banking shares retreated across the board, as Commerzbank fell 2.5 to 229, Deutsche Bank was down 2.5 to 425.5, and Dresdner Bank lost 2 to 246.5.    Stocks also closed lower in Paris, Zurich and Stockholm, but rose in Brussels, Amsterdam and Milan.    Paris share prices were broadly lower in thin trading. Analysts said investors have adopted a wait-and-see stance that is likely to persist until President Francois Mitterrand announces whether he intends to stand for re-election in next month's general election.    Meanwhile, share prices closed lower in Seoul, Manila, Taipei and Sydney, were mixed in Wellington and Singapore and higher in Hong Kong.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end.                                                    % This                                 Mar 7    Mar 4     Year U.S. .......................... 246.4    246.8    +  7.4 Britain ....................... 551.8    555.8    +  7.0 Canada ........................ 360.5    358.0    +  2.8 Japan ........................ 1244.3   1244.1    + 21.7 France ........................ 305.8    307.2    +  6.0 Germany ....................... 169.3    169.1    +  8.2 Hong Kong .................... 1766.4   1765.8    +  7.4 Switzerland ................... 157.5    156.4    + 11.9 Australia ..................... 262.9    257.5    +  1.4 World index ................... 446.4    444.1    +  9.4</TEXT></DOC>
