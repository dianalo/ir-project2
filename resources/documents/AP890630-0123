The officers leading the coup _ Sudan's fourth in 33 years _suspended the constitution, declared a state of emergency and bannedindependent newspapers, according to Egypt's Middle East News Agency.   They warned they may punish violent opposition to the coup withdeath, but promised non-partisan, non-racist government in thenation divided by a southern war between dominant Moslem northernersof Arab descent and a black Nubian minority of Christians andanimists.   The war has cost the government a ruinous $1 million a day whileit ran up a foreign debt of $13 billion. Soaring inflation andwidespread consumer shortages caused food riots in Khartoum earlierthis year.   The new rulers took power shortly after midnight, the news agencysaid, and declared themselves a National Salvation Revolutioncouncil under the chairmanship of Brig. Omar Hassan Ahmed Bashir. Heis the third-ranking officer in the paratroop corps.   Bashir announced the coup on official Radio Omdurman and namedhimself prime minister, defense minister and armed forces commander.   He imposed an indefinite nighttime curfew on the dusty capital ofAfrica's largest country, one-third the size of the continentalUnited States.   Khartoum's airport and Sudan's airspace were closed. Soldiersbarricaded the bridges over the Blue Nile and White Nile, isolatingthe three sections of the capital.   There were conflicting reports about Mahdi's status. One said heescaped arrest. Another said he was seen being driven from his homeby soldiers.   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the U.S.Embassy in Khartoum confirmed the coup.   ``The military reportedly has arrested a number of Cabinetmembers,'' said Ms. Tutwiler.   ``We regret the military is taking action to overthrow Sudan'sdemocratically elected government, and we urge an early return todemocracy,'' she said. ``It is critical that whoever is in controltakes immediate steps to find a peaceful solution to the war and toimprove the provision of humanitarian relations.''   Bashir is a veteran of the six-year southern war and citedMahdi's failure to end the conflict as a key reason for hisoverthrow.   But the coup's effect on a current peace initiative is unknown.   In Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, where a new round of peace talks was tostart Tuesday, spokesman Edward Lino of the rebel Sudan People'sLiberation Army said it is premature to discuss the situation. Hesaid the rebels have not heard from Khartoum about Tuesday's talks.   For months, the military has been restive about Mahdi'sreluctance to negotiate with the rebels.   Last year, the army command reminded Mahdi that soldiers weredying while the government vacillated. Army officers threatened tomove against him if Mahdi continued to delay. The United States andother countries threatened to withhold aid for the same reason.   Mahdi finally gave in, and peace talks began in May.   Sudan's new rulers do not appear allied with army commanders whoforced Mahdi to capitulate.   ``The coup leaders have designated the general command and armyleaders as `the former command,''' the Egyptian agency said,indicating the paratroop and armored units that ousted Mahdi werenot from the top echelons of Sudan's military command.   It is the fourth coup since Sudan proclaimed independence from anEgyptian-British consortium on Jan. 1, 1956. The military has ruledfor 23 of the past 33 years.   Gili Farah, a Sudan News Agency journalist, said there were noreports of violence during or after the coup.   Bashir said his takeover was neither partisan nor sectarian,appearing to disavow any connection with the fundamentalist NationalIslamic Front, Sudan's second-biggest party after Mahdi's, anddictator Gaafar Nimeiri, who last week said he would regain powersoon.   ``The National Salvation Revolution is a genuine Sudaneserevolution, the revolution of a people who rose up against tyranny,corruption, partisanship and sectarianism,'' Bashir's statement said.   ``It's a national revolution, neither leftist nor rightist, notpartisan, not Mayist, not racist.''   ``Mayist'' refers to followers of Nimeiri, who seized power in aMay 25, 1969, coup and called his 16-year rule the ``MayRevolution.''   Nimeiri was overthrown in April 1985 by a military council thatruled for a year then surrendered power in April 1986 to Mahdi,whose Umma Party won a parliamentary majority in military-organizedelections.   Part of the Oxford-educated Mahdi's problem was that he is agreat-grandson of the Mahdi, whose fervent Moslem followers defeateda British colonial force and brought brief independence to Sudan inthe late 1800s. The mantle of religious leadership caused him toavoid decisions that may have been interpreted as anti-Moslem.   One southern demand was the removal of harsh Islamic lawsintroduced by Nimeiri and suspended by Mahdi earlier this year.   Southern Sudanese want more autonomy and development in theirregion, which is plagued by war-induced famine.</TEXT></DOC>
