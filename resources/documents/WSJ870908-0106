Brazil's planned meeting with Mexico and Argentina revives creditor fears that big debtor countries might join together in a coordinated moratorium, or even default, on their foreign debts. Brazil hasn't paid banks interest on $67 billion of medium-term and long-term debt for almost seven months and now is proposing that its bank creditors convert half their Brazilian credits into discounted long-term bonds.    &quot;Our proposal is only ours. But what I know very well is the Argentinians are very unhappy with their previous agreement and the Mexicans also are. I have talked very deeply with both finance ministers,&quot; Mr. Bresser Pereira said in an interview here Friday, after attending an international conference on debt and economic policy.    Western governments are taking such dangers seriously. Mr. Bresser Pereira said U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker has requested a meeting with the minister, which is scheduled for today in Washington, to discuss Brazil's new proposal.    The proposal appears to ensure an outright confrontation between Brazil and its foreign creditors lasting many months.    Revealed last week and discussed in some detail by Mr. Bresser Pereira on Friday, the proposal would require bank creditors to write down half their medium-term and long-term Brazilian loans toward their present market value of about 55 cents on the dollar. Banks then would exchange the loans for bonds that would carry an interest rate fixed below market rates, the minister said, although he added that details of the proposed bonds and their pricing have yet to be worked out and that he plans to present alternatives to his bank creditors when he meets with them Sept. 23 and 24.    Nevertheless, the proposal, as sketched out so far, would force banks to take write-downs of as much as $15 billion on their Brazilian debts alone, and would set a precedent that other big debtors would seek to copy, bringing tens of billions of dollars of more potential write-downs, which would break several big international banks.    In the light of such concerns, Mr. Bresser Pereira is likely to get a cool reception when he meets with Mr. Baker today. &quot;I have the impression {the U.S. authorities} aren't prepared yet for this kind of proposal,&quot; Mr. Bresser Pereira said, adding, &quot;I think Mr. Baker really has the possibility to make some innovation in this area. It will take some time for him.&quot;    But Mr. Baker won't find it easy to persuade Mr. Bresser Pereira to soften Brazil's new radical stance. &quot;I understand we are making a proposal that interests Brazil. I'm interested in hearing Mr. Baker's response, but actually the decision is Brazil's,&quot; the minister said.    The Brazilian proposal is a radical departure from -- and a challenge to -- Mr. Baker's own strategy for dealing with the international debt crisis. The so-called Baker Plan, announced in autumn 1985, calls on commercial banks and the World Bank to make new loans to troubled debtor countries that restructure their economies by boosting exports, reducing government spending and implementing other measures.    Despite the Labor Day weekend holiday, Brazil's new proposal already is causing anxiety on Wall Street. &quot;This could put the banks under. It's the doomsday scenario,&quot; a senior U.S. investment banker who specializes in developing-country debt said yesterday. Mr. Bresser Pereira &quot;has no idea what that kind of {proposal} means for the banks,&quot; he added.    Furthermore, Brazil's radical proposal comes at a particularly awkward time for big U.S. banks, as they recently have begun trying to issue new stock to boost their capital after making big loan-loss provisions against their shaky credits to developing countries. Citicorp plans to issue 17 million new shares, currently valued at about $1 billion, and Manufacturers Hanover Corp. said last week that it expects to issue about $250 million of new shares.    The new debt proposal has bankers annoyed and puzzled. &quot;This situation was created by Brazil&quot; and its own economic policies, said Louis Schirano, senior vice president of First Interstate Bank of California. &quot;I don't hear anything with regard to Brazil's contractual obligations&quot; on its bank debt, he said, and he suggested that the proposal be &quot;modified rather quickly.&quot;    &quot;I have no time for those who negotiate agreements and don't abide by them for political reasons,&quot; Mr. Schirano added.    Over the weekend, U.S. bankers questioned whether Brazil even wants to reach any debt settlement until next year for domestic political reasons, particularly because the current constitutional debate has yet to be resolved and because the country doesn't yet wish to strike any agreement with the International Monetary Fund.    &quot;Banks aren't going to accept a deal unless they have a program with the IMF,&quot; said one senior U.S. banker, who speculated that Mr. Bresser Pereira's new strategy could result in President Jose Sarney appointing a new Brazilian finance minister. It also could result in a hardening of attitudes among Brazil's creditors that could result in legal actions and damage to Brazil's trade and economy, he said.    Mr. Bresser Pereira is no doubt hearing some of this from the banks already. His chief debt negotiator, Fernao Bracher, and central-bank director in charge of foreign debt Antonio Seixas, who were with him in Vienna and are accompanying him to Washington, visited Swiss and German banks last week. They also went to Paris to talk with former IMF managing director Jacques Delarosiere, who apparently was cool toward the new Brazilian proposal.    But in the meantime, the minister apparently prefers to listen to the counsel he is getting from advisers like Harvard economics professor Jeffrey Sachs. Mr. Sachs, who also advises Bolivia, told last week's conference here of &quot;the wonderful effects&quot; of stopping payments to bank creditors, and said that banks can afford to absorb the $90 billion cost of a full discount to market value of their loans to Brazil and other less-developed countries. </TEXT></DOC>
