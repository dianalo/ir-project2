 One strategy is based on a transition to OS/2 andthe Presentation Manager, while the alternative strategy is based on DOS andWindows 3.0.andM;In its recent product releases, Lotus has committed to the OS/2 PresentationManager strategy.andM;A central element of Lotus' strategy is to move customers from DOS to OS/2and then from OS/2 to the Presentation Manager.andM;Lotus has committed a substantial number of software developers to projectsinvolving OS/2 and Presentation Manager -- a clear indication that its moreimportant software will be developed for that platform.andM;The OS/2 EdgeandM;The move to OS/2 allows new Lotus products to take advantage of themultitasking and data-exchange features of OS/2.andM;In contrast, Microsoft Corp. is pursuing a dual strategy aimed at providingseparate graphical interfaces for both DOS and OS/2.andM;Microsoft strongly encourages both vendors and users to move as rapidly aspossible to the OS/2 environment.andP;  However, for those users unwilling to makethe transition to OS/2, Microsoft will provide a graphical version of DOSbased on Windows 3.0.andM;DOS/Windows 3.0 will comply with IBM's specifications for Common User Access(CUA) and will have the same user interface as OS/2 Presentation Manager.andM;As shown in the figure, the DOS/ Windows strategy provides a growth path thatoffers users an initial graphical interface under DOS, and then moves insimple steps to OS/2 with Windows 3.0 and finally to OS/2 with PresentationManager.andM;The DOS market is at a critical juncture.andP;  By the end of the year, it isprojected, more than 55 percent of the installed base will consist ofmachines based on the 286 microprocessor.andM;This percentage is even higher in most foreign countries because the purchaseof PCs began much later than in the United States.andM;The implication of this percentage is that the platforms required to run OS/2will soon make up the majority of the installed base.andM;Despite Lotus' plan for moving to OS/2, most organizations continue toinclude DOS in their near-term planning.andP;  It is evident that large numbers ofusers are not ready to make the transition to OS/2.andM;These users want a DOS-based, graphical, multitasking operating environmentthat will provide an easy transition to OS/2 in the future.andM;This is precisely the objective of the DOS/Windows strategy.andM;The advantages of the DOS/Windows approach include support for 8086, 286 and386 machines; a graphical user interface; consistency with the look and feelof OS/2; multitasking; memory management; and support of conventional,extended or expanded memory.andM;Although the release of Windows 3.0 has been delayed until the first quarterof 1990, most vendors of OS/2 Presentation Manager products are porting theirsoftware to the Windows 3.0 environment.andM;Because of the advantages of this environment as a stepping-stone to OS/2,Lotus may have to alter its position with respect to support for a DOS/Windows strategy.andM;In most large organizations, the decision to move to OS/2 won't be made byusers; it will be made at the executive level.andP;  One of the best ways to bringusers into the world of OS/2 is to provide a familiar application that allowsthem to learn the environment through their routine jobs.andM;Lotus intends to provide the vehicles to make this shift occur.andP;  For example,release 3.0 of its 1-2-3 spreadsheet package can be installed under DOS orunder OS/2.andP;  Worksheets, macros and graphs will perform the same under eitheroperating system.andM;Moving from DOS to the Presentation Manager under OS/2 could require majorchanges -- primarily in hardware.andP;  To adequately run OS/2 and applications,the user will need a 286-based or 386-based machine with at least 4M bytes ofmemory.andM;Once OS/2 is in place, 1-2-3 release 3.0 will run a little faster, networkingwill be more robust, the network won't be able to crash the system, andmultitasking will be available.andM;Lotus originally intended to provide a character-based upgrade of 1-2-3 thatwould run on the large base of older 8088 and 8086 machines.andP;  The company,however, fundamentally shifted its spreadsheet strategy when it moved fromthe assembler-based code of early 1-2-3 releases (release 1A and 2.01) to theC language.andP;  The move to C allowed Lotus to develop core product code thatwas essentially independent of the run-time environment.andM;Unfortunately for Lotus, the C strategy backfired in two respects.andM;First, the time required to rearchitect and then develop a new C-basedspreadsheet exceeded Lotus' estimate.andP;  The project was more than a year latein getting to the market.andM;As Lotus struggled to get the new product out, developers were faced withtheir second challenge.andP;  The new C-based spreadsheet incorporated morefunctions and features than did its predecessor, and, as a result, it couldnot run on early-generation personal computers.andM;It eventually became obvious that Lotus would have to segment the hardwaremarket and deliver its newer technology only to the newer-generation PCs.andM;Three-Pronged ApproachandM;In all, Lotus developed a three-pronged strategy for its spreadsheetproducts, segmenting the market into three categories.andM;The older 8086 and 8088 machines with 640K bytes of conventional memoryconstitute the first group.andP;  Computers based on the 286 or 386 chip with 1Mbyte of memory constitute the next group, which is soon to become the largestone.andM;The third market segment will be made up of 286-based and 386-based machineswith more than 3M bytes of RAM running under OS/2 and the PresentationManager.andM;Protected-mode (DOS extension) technology from Rational Systems was selectedas a solution for the memory requirements of release 3.0 of 1-2-3.andP;  Thistechnology provides an unobtrusive means of accessing memory above 640K bytesunder DOS (up to 16M bytes).andP;  Users will not have to make any specialsettings upon installation and should not even notice that they are operatingin the protected mode.andM;One immediate benefit of this technology is relief from tight memoryconstraints when running 1-2-3 on a network.andM;Protected-mode technology allows the network and memory-resident software torun in the first 640K bytes, with 1-2-3 applications running in the remainingextended memory.andM;Next week I'll discuss the competitive issues over which the software wars ofthe 1990s will be fought and how Lotus is meeting these issues.andM;----------To learn more about the subject of these articles, please call The JamesMartin Report, an information service updated quarterly, at (800) 242-1240.andO;For information on seminars, please contact (in the United States and Canada)Technology Transfer Institute, 741 10th St., Santa Monica, Calif.andP;
