Kennedy when he entered the White House? He wasindeed, as his official biographers claimed, intelligent, politicallyexperienced, eager for information, respectful of first-class minds, andwilling to link the presidency with good taste and high culture. Hecommunicated exceptionally well with the press and public. He was capable ofinspiring vast audiences with his rhetoric. He had at times in his life shownconsiderable courage. Ideologically, Kennedy was at best a sort of centristDemocrat, interested in using the federal government to right a number ofwrongs. He was militantly anti-communist and committed to an aggressiveforeign policy.;    Beneath the surface, however, Jack was pragmatic to thepoint of amorality; his sole standard seemed to be political expediency.Gifted with good looks, youth and wealth, he was often, in his personal life,reckless, vain, selfish, petty and lecherous. Jack's character, so much areflection of his father's single-minded pursuit of political power andpersonal indulgence, lacked a moral center, a reference point that went beyondself-aggrandizement.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  KENNEDY'S LEGACY: WIT AND CHARM, LECHERYAND VANITY  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Last in a five-part series.ProfileFrom the book &quot;A Question of Character: A Life of John F.

Chief executives may draw upon theirintelligence, experience and ideology; they may seek advice from experts inevery field; they may master the political arts. But ultimately the characterof the individual, his essential values and priorities, his sense of right andwrong, will determine the ends to which these resources will be used.;    Aperson of good character may lack some qualities essential for a strongleader. One thinks of Jimmy Carter -- a man of integrity, self-discipline,industriousness, and deep religious faith. Clearly, more is required of afirst-rate president than good character. The reverse may also be true: LyndonJohnson, we now know, was in some ways a man of deplorable morals, and yet in1965 he presided over more morally significant domestic legislativeinnovations than any president in any single session of Congress in thiscentury.;    A president must play several roles, including administrativedirector, legislative leader, party head, commander in chief, No. 1 diplomat,spokesman for social justice, friend of business and labor, and molder of thefederal judicial system. He is also a moral exemplar to his people, one whoseoffice commands and enables him to set the standard of ethics and excellencefor all.;    As James David Barber put it, &quot;The president is expected topersonify our betterness in an inspiring way, to express in what he does andis (not just in what he says) a moral idealism which, in much of the publicmind, is the very opposite of 'politics.' &quot; Michael Novak has observed: &quot;Everyfour years Americans elect a king -- but not only a king, also a high priestand prophet.&quot; Harry Truman reflected late in life: &quot;I've said before, thepresident is the only person in the government who represents the whole people. . . and when there's a moral issue involved, the president has to be themoral leader of the country.&quot;;    The media largely shapes the public'sperceptions of a president, and, during the Thousand Days and after hisassassination, JFK was portrayed in large part as a saint and superman.However, we may now confidently conclude that Jack was not the man projectedin the image. His attractiveness, easy confidence, wit and charm werepersuasive and seductive. He and his family were every reporter's dream and anation's fantasy of what all families should look like and be. Jack's seemingenergy, sincerity and fidelity were congruent with America's self-image in theworld. It all seemed glorious at the time and long after. But the sober truth,which readers of history seek when time has passed, was more complex and oftenmuch less flattering than the media of the moment would have had us believe.;   As an administrator Kennedy was competent if unorthodox. He was morefriendly to business than to labor. His judicial appointments, especiallyoutside the South, seemed to reflect good judgment. Kennedy made little impactas a party leader; having usually worked outside the normal channels, he wasnot highly regarded within them.;    As a legislative leader, Kennedy wasrelatively ineffective. Weak support in Congress was part of the problem. Thepresident's lack of conviction and personal fervor for what he was advocatingwas partly responsible. His reluctant approach to civil rights, until quitelate in his Thousand Days, is a case in point.;    Jack was primarilyinterested in foreign affairs, and it was in his roles as commander in chiefand diplomatic leader that he made his principal contributions. It is also inthis area of presidential activity that Kennedy's character may be seen mostvividly in the decision-making process.;    In the Bay of Pigs fiasco, Jackrejected moral and legal objections to an invasion; he lied, exhibited analmost adolescent macho temperament, became involved with military operationsjust enough to make them worse, and then blamed others for the failure.Determined to win in Cuba at any cost, Jack had secret dealings with one ofthe top mobsters involved in the assassination attempts. This reveals anirresponsibility and lack of judgment bordering on dereliction.;    Theadministration's response to the crisis in Southeast Asia involved complexideological, military and political considerations. In Laos, Jack approved a&quot;secret war&quot; that for years spread mayhem and death throughout the strife-tornnation. In Vietnam, the president revealed an almost reckless posture and anintense determination to win.;    In the Berlin crisis, on the other hand,Kennedy's pugnacity in defense of free world rights was morally defensible,effective and highly popular. The administration's diplomatic posture ofdrawing a line and daring the Soviets to cross it was risky but, given thenature of Nikita Khrushchev's temperament and ambitions, probably inevitable.In retrospect the president's firm stand seems to merit the widespread praiseit received at the time.;    Due in part to a preoccupation with his ownpolitical agenda and an intense hostility toward reformers, Kennedy was areluctant spokesman for social justice. As David Burner and Thomas R. Westhave concluded, &quot;The most loyal and affectionate liberal partisan of JohnKennedy cannot make him into a dedicated, consistent and impassioned championof a leftward movement in American politics.&quot; Still, he could boast of severalachievements, including the Area Redevelopment Act of 1961, which promotedpublic works in such economically crippled areas as West Virginia, and thecivil rights legislation that occupied much of his attention in 1963.;    Healso worked persistently, if unsuccessfully, on behalf of legislation to aideducation. If Kennedy lacked a grand vision of what America might be, therewere nonetheless a few programs he did feel strongly about.;    In fairness itmust also be observed that the electorate was not crying out for socialjustice legislation in the early 1960s.;    If Kennedy was far from a moralcrusader, what may be said in summary about his personal misconduct as itrelated to the presidency? Given the facts now available, it is clear thatKennedy abused his high position for personal self-gratification. His recklessliaisons with women and mobsters were irresponsible, dangerous and demeaningto the office of the chief executive.;    They were irresponsible because ofthe enormous potential for scandal and blackmail they posed. Any number ofwomen, gangsters, intelligence agents, and journalists might have used theirknowledge of Kennedy's sexual meandering to force concessions from the officeof the president. The Kennedys had purchased silence in the past, but thestakes were far higher now that Jack was in the White House, and money mightwell have been inadequate.;    Had Kennedy lived to see a second term, therealities of his lechery and his dealings with Sam Giancana might have leakedout while he was still in office, gravely damaging the presidency,debilitating his administration, and severely disillusioning a populace which,no matter how jaded it seems, looks to a president with hope for reassuranceand leadership.;    Kennedy's personal foibles were also dangerous to thewelfare of this country and the free world. While we know of only one specificcase in which the president was separated from the official who carries thesecret information vital to the nation's nuclear defense, and is supposed tobe near the chief executive at all times, such incidents surely happened oftenin the course of Jack's clandestine prowlings. When the president, forexample, was roaming through the tunnels beneath New York's Carlyle Hotel toevade reporters and reach intimate friends, was he prepared to handle nationalsecurity matters?;    It is true that one must pay heed to the realities ofU.S. presidential politics: they are rough, often dirty, and at best requiremany compromises of principle. A St. Francis is highly unlikely to reach theWhite House. There is truth in Michael Novak's observation that the &quot;higherpersons advance in any social organization, the greater their complicity inthe injustices of which that institution is the inevitable carrier.&quot;;   Still, this nation has had many chief executives who achieved greatness. Andthey were great, in part, because they were men of exceptional character. Goodcharacter is an essential framework for the complex mixture of qualities thatmake an outstanding president and a model leader for a democratic people.Character is a question of values, inclinations and judgment, all of which arebrought to bear in the day-to-day work of leadership.;    During the ThousandDays, Kennedy arrogantly and irresponsibly violated his covenant with thepeople. While saying and doing the appropriate things in the public light, heacted covertly in ways that seriously demeaned himself and his office. He gotaway with it at the time, and the cover-up that followed kept the truth hiddenfor decades. That this could happen again makes it imperative that we searchfor presidential candidates who can, by example, elevate and inspire theAmerican people, restoring confidence in their institutions and in themselves.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Thomas C.
