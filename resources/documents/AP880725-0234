JONES</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ESCONDIDO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The walls of Dr. Robert K. Graham'srelatively ordinary-looking office are lined with the pictures ofdozens of babies he says are far from ordinary _ the products ofthe so-called Nobel Prize sperm bank.   ``This is our pride and joy and, by God, every one is a gem,''said Graham of the children born to mothers inseminated with``superior'' sperm provided by his Repository for Germinal Choice.   Graham, 81, a multimillionaire who developed the shatterproofeyeglass lens, is on a mission to save the human species. Superiorgenes are being lost, he says, because society's smartest don'thave enough children while the masses proliferate with zeal.   Graham founded the bank in early 1980 and began collecting thesperm of a select few ``outstanding intellects'' and giving it toqualified couples, with the goal of bringing into the worldpotential leaders or great scientists.   The bank claims responsibility for 55 babies, and 18 women arepregnant.   Graham says his program is working, that most of the childrendevelop at a much faster rate than their peers and are judgedgifted. Geneticists, however, still find fault, saying the programminimizes women's role in reproduction and exaggerates thelikelihood children will inherit all their parents' good genes.   But the proud parents cheer Graham for bringing them brightchildren they deserved but couldn't have, usually because thefather was infertile.   ``I just wanted to have a child,'' said Adrienne Ramm, a dancerfrom New York City whose daughter Leandra turned 4 on Wednesday.``I believe that the donor sprem was from a man that seemed to be agreat human being. We were increasing our chances of having abright and healthy child.''   ``I can't imagine anyone would go there because they want asuper baby,'' said a Riverside mother who asked that her name notbe used. ``It's just the best choice available for those who chooseartificial insemination.''   When Graham opened his repository, critics ranging fromfeminists to communists and the Roman Catholic church denounced itas a ``master race'' plan reminiscent of Adolf Hitler. Thecontroversy was fueled by Nobel Prize winner William Shockley'srevelation that he was a donor and by Graham's own views.   Shockley, a physicist who invented the junction transistor,believed that certain races _ blacks for example _ were geneticallydisposed to be intellectually inferior.   Graham, in his book ``The Future of Man,'' called man ``anevolutionary derelict'' because ``huge masses of those withordinary minds have been allowed to come into being and thenproliferate.''   Over time, artificial insemination became common, and moreradical techniques, like in vitro insemination and gene mapping,took the spotlight in the reproductive industry. To Graham'sdelight, protestors disappeared from outside his office about 30miles north of downtown San Diego.   Alexander Capron, a scholar at the University of SouthernCalifornia and former member of President Reagan's Commission onBio-ethics, has concerns with the repository, but gratefully notes``it hasn't become a major force in reproduction.''   ``I continue to think of it as a rather silly, misguidedeffort,'' Capron said. ``The whole notion of individuality and ofuniqueness is what amounts to a genetic accident.   ``The idea that you're going to get an `Olympian' could lead toparents' frustrations when expectations aren't fulfilled.''   Capron also has ethical concerns. ``What does it say about amother's contribution in reproduction? In it is the potential for amore eugenic society with somebody deciding what genes get passedalong.''   Graham counters that he neither promises nor expects thechildren to reach their fathers' levels of success or intellect,but says:   ``We can with considerable assurance say we are contributing tothe next generation by bringing a number of capable, constructiveindividuals, including leaders who wouldn't otherwise have beenborn, or ... wouldn't be as bright.''   The identities of donors, described by Graham as ``tops in theirfield'' and ``outstanding intellects,'' are withheld from theparents and the public. The list includes two Nobelists and anOlympian. All are of European descent or Jewish, and most areCalifornia scientists. Graham says he's invited blacks and Asiansto donate, but that they've refused.   Donors are declared of good health and genetic ancestry, whichmeans their families are free of such diseases as alcoholism andmental illness, and the donated sperm is screened for the acquiredimmune deficiency syndrome virus. Part of the AIDS screeningincludes a 180-day sperm quarantine.   The sperm, stored in tanks of liquid nitrogen that keep itfrozen, has been sent around the country and as far away as Egypt.   Applicant parents must show they are married, intelligent,emotionally and financially stable, with a clean physical andmental health history. The mother must be under age 38. About halfthe applicants are rejected. Parents choose a donor from suchinformation as intelligence test score, ancestry, hair and eyecolor, athletic ability, hobbies, and personality traits.   When they had Leandra, Adrienne and David Ramm chose afair-haired science professor of European roots described as lovinggardening, skiing and children. For their second child, due nextmonth, they chose the Olympic athlete.   ``At first, I did feel inadequate and weird about the idea ofusing a donor,'' said Ramm, a computer systems manager who isinfertile. ``But Adrienne really wanted a baby and that was fine byme. The only tough part is that since Leandra is so incrediblybright she's constantly exploring and challenging and intoeverything, which can be exhausting.   ``But it's the price you pay for having such a bright baby.''   Most sperm banks provide limited screening and don't allowparents to choose among donors, and the repository parents say itis the thorough medical check and quality of donors that draw them,not a desire for super children.   Repository parents also acknowledge they promote their child'sintellectual development and have high expectations, but say theyare not unreasonable.   ``I don't have flash cards around the crib since he was twoweeks old, but I do expose Jeffrey to as much as I can,'' theRiverside mother said.   The 33-year-old woman and her 45-year-old second husband came toGraham because the husband had a vasectomy in an earlier marriage.Between them, they already had six other children from previousmarriages.   Although her other children are bright _ her two teen-age girlsare honor students _ she says 1{-year-old Jeffrey is different: Herequires little sleep for his age, only seven hours, is extremelyinquisitive and loves books.   Her stories echo those of other repository parents, several ofwhom have come back for a second child, Graham says. The children's``vocabulary is often twice that expected. They're standing earlyand walking young.''   Graham requires annual reports from parents, but is frustratedthat his experiment lacks rigid scientific standards because thedonors and parents vary and the children are raised in differentenvironments. But he added, ``The general consequences of bright,happy kids is good enough for me.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for July 28</NOTE></DOC>
