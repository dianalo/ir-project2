In 1986, Israel banned new defense contracts with South Africa,as well as government loans and investments. The government alsosaid it would not promote tourism to South Africa or serve as atransit point for countries trying to circumvent internationaltrade sanctions against Pretoria.   Israel adopted the sanctions to comply with the U.S. Congress,which threatened to cut foreign aid to countries which did notpunish Pretoria for its apartheid policy.   ``We will do our best to persuade the Israeli government suchmeasures would only be harmful to the poorer sections of ourpopulation,'' Viljoen told Israel radio.   Dozens of demonstrators protested outside Herzog's home, callingon Israel to distance itself from apartheid, thegovernment-legislated system of desegregation that bars SouthAfrica's 25.6 million blacks from a role in public life.   Viljoen said he was not fazed by the protest. ``I've received somany messages of welcome, and such a warm welcome, that completelyoutweighs the small demonstrations that have taken place.''   Viljoen arrived in Israel 10 days ago, on the same day thejailed leader of South Africa's blacks, Nelson Mandela, celebratedhis 70th birthday.</TEXT></DOC>
