That prospect and other recent developments have boosted morale at the long-distance-telecommunications concern. Pricing pressures have stabilized. Most of MCI's digital network is built. With the recent additions of 800 service, operator assistance and direct-dial service to 146 countries, MCI is finally matching American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. in a full range of offerings.    And William McGowan, MCI's founder, chairman and spiritual leader, is back at his desk and cracking jokes after undergoing a heart transplant last spring.    &quot;We are really on an 'up' right now,&quot; says MCI's president, Bert C. Roberts Jr.    Last year, MCI's capital spending and other costs exceeded its cash flow by $200 million, reflecting an aggressive buildup of its optical-fiber and digital network systems. But with most of that upgrading accomplished and with long-distance-rate pressures waning, the company expects to see a strong positive flow of cash beginning late this year or early in 1989, says Daniel F. Akerson, chief financial officer.    Reducing the debt-to-equity ratio from 67% to around 40% over the next four years and buying the stake held by Armonk, N.Y.-based IBM will have top priority in the financial restructuring, Mr. Akerson says. A third priority would be an acquisition, but that's not expected for the next year or two.    In the meantime, MCI feels more confident about its ability to compete head-to-head against New York-based ATandamp;T. &quot;Our sales force is better, younger, more experienced and more energetic,&quot; contends Mr. Roberts. &quot;The company is more flexible than ATandamp;T. The product mix is coming along faster than ATandamp;T because we already have most of the upgrade to digital behind us.&quot;    Still, ATandamp;T dominates the industry. Of the $50 billion annual long-distance market, MCI captured only $3.9 billion in 1987. One of the company's goals, according to Vice Chairman V. Orville Wright, is to strengthen its No. 2 position. &quot;We're Avis and we're going to be Avis&quot; in a market that should support &quot;three or four players with fairly equal market shares,&quot; he says.    Independent surveys of major telecommunications customers show that MCI has strong growth potential as companies demand more than one long-distance provider. MCI has &quot;done a good job attacking the Fortune 1000,&quot; says Charles Schelke, an analyst with Smith Barney. But he notes that MCI's reputation for quality is still less consistent than ATandamp;T's, and MCI could face new troubles &quot;if Sprint comes on strongly or if ATandamp;T cuts costs significantly over the next couple of years.&quot;    But industry analysts generally predict a spurt in MCI's profit, partly reflecting improvement in the market for all alternative long-distance companies. &quot;MCI is in the right place with the right board to catch the wave,&quot; says Robert Morris of Prudential-Bache's San Francisco office. Analysts estimate that 1988 profit will be between 60 cents to 65 cents a share, up from 1987 profit of $88 million, or 31 cents a share.    In making its pitch to big customers, MCI has been helped by its relationship with IBM. Moreover, the involvement of IBM often provides customers with an added sense of security, Mr. Roberts says. He cites United Airlines, the first major company to sign up for a special service offered under a joint marketing arrangement with IBM, and the National Science Foundation, which selected MCI and IBM to work on a project to upgrade connections linking regional supercomputer centers.    MCI forged its alliance with IBM in 1986, when it acquired IBM's share of Satellite Business Systems in exchange for 47 million shares of MCI stock. Although there has been some debate within MCI about how the relationship should evolve, Mr. Roberts suggests that MCI, over the next two to five years, will have purchased the stock held by IBM.    Under existing agreements, MCI could sell $100 million of new common stock and could issue as much as $300 million of convertible debentures or convertible preferred stock to IBM. However, IBM can't acquire more than 30% of MCI's common stock without the company's approval. Although some MCI executives have toyed with the idea of using that money for expansion, others are concerned that IBM could end up dominating MCI, which might lose its independence and entrepreneurial spirit.    A spokeswoman for IBM said it would be inappropriate to comment on the MCI stake.    As marketing efforts accelerate at MCI, the pace of capital expenditures is dropping. In a three-year span that ended in 1986, MCI spent about $1 billion a year on its network, much of it for converting to digital from analog equipment. Over the next decade, MCI expects to spend only about $3 billion to keep improving network quality. Plans call for adding redundant or alternate routes and greater &quot;intelligence&quot; -- more-sophisticated computers and software to handle special voice and data communications.    The efforts reflect MCI's goals of differentiating its products from those of competitors and growing faster than the market grows. Those goals are part of a 10-year strategic plan that MCI adopted last year after extensive soul-searching. Mr. Wright guided the plan's development during the months when Mr. McGowan was recuperating.    To no one's surprise, the new goals don't include paying a dividend, a practice the company has avoided so far. &quot;I understand that some companies do pay dividends,&quot; Mr. McGowan says with a wry smile. &quot;But I don't see any danger of our doing that.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
