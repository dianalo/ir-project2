A proposeddecision concerning captan was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on June 21, 1985 (50 FR 25884). Supporting documentsincluding the Technical Support Document for the PD 2/3 were made availableto any requesting party at that time. EPA has evaluated the issues raisedin the preliminary documents listed above in light of comments and additionaldata received during the Special Review process. In summary, EPA has decidedto allow the continued registration of technical captan and all currentlyregistered non-food uses including non-food agricultural uses (e.g. ornamentals)and to cancel the registration of all food uses of captan except for thefollowing: Almonds, apples (pre- and post-harvest), apricots, blackberries,blueberries, celery (plant-bed), cherries (pre- and post-harvest), dewberries,eggplant (plant-bed), grapes, green onions, lettuce, mangoes, nectarines,peaches, pears (post-harvest only), plums/prunes, peppers (plant-bed),pimentos (plant-bed), raspberries, spinach (plant-bed), strawberries, taroand tomatoes (plant-bed), and all seed treatments.  It should be noted that the residue chemistry data required under FIFRAsection 3(c)(2)(b) have not been submitted for all of the uses listed inthe preceding paragraph, and that in some cases data have only been submittedin support of particular formulations or application methods. On December7, 1988, EPA issued a Notice of Intent to Suspend all agricultural fooduses (except seed treatments) for which residue data had not been received.Registrants were given 30 days to submit data or request a hearing. Dueto a technical error on the part of EPA, this Notice of Intent to Suspendis being revoked. Registrants will be notified of the revocation. The Agencyis considering whether to issue a new Notice of Intent to Suspend the agriculturalfood uses for which residue data have not been received. Therefore, althoughEPA, in terminating this Special Review of captan, has determined thatthe benefits of the use of captan on the food sites listed in the summaryoutweigh the risks from these uses, the use of captan on some food sites(i.e., blackberries, blueberries, celery, dewberries, eggplant, lettuce,mangoes, green onions, peppers, pimentos, raspberries, spinach, and taro)are subject to suspension for failure to provide data required to supportthe continued registration.

Since the benefits havebeen determined to outweigh the risks for these uses of captan, registrationcan be supported with the submission of required data. It is EPA's policyto work with the Interregional Research Program (IR-4), the pesticide industryand user groups in an effort to obtain data in support of new and existingregistrations for minor uses. EPA policies implemented to facilitate minoruse registrations are discussed in a Policy Statement of April 2, 1986(51 FR 11341). Those interested in having captan products available forthe minor uses retained in this Notice but subject to suspension actionunder FIFRA section 3(c)(2)(B) are encouraged to pursue registration witha captan registrant. If the registrant determines that the cost of meetingthe data requirements are prohibitive for these uses, it may be feasiblefor grower organizations or other associations to enter into a financialagreement with a captan registrant who is prepared to collect the requireddata for a particular registration. Alternatively, a request may be submittedto the IR-4 Program for the development of the required data. The IR-4Program is a nation-wide cooperative effort including EPA, the U.S. Departmentof Agriculture, State agricultural experiment stations and industry, whichassists in the development of data (primarily residue data) for pesticideminor uses. Additional information may be obtained from the IR-4 Program,Cook College, P.O. Box 231, Rutgers University, The State University, NewBrunswick, New Jersey 08903.Other regulatory actions concerning products containing captan that arepending but are not part of the Special Review process are as follows:(i) EPA will propose to revoke the tolerance for captan on detreated cornseed since data in support of this tolerance have not been submitted. Theproposed revocation will be announced in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4>(ii) A Data Call-In (DCI), issued October 26, 1988, required the submissionof a 90-Day Inhalation Toxicity Study and a 90-Day Dermal Toxicity Studyin rats. EPA is concerned with renal changes in male rats and local irritationof nasal passages, esophagus and forestomach in both sexes that were reportedin a supplementary 90-day inhalation study submitted by industry's CaptanTask Force representing the major manufacturers of captan including ICIAmericas, Inc., Chevron Chemical Company, Inc., and Makhteshim-Agan (America),Inc. The data must be submitted in 10 and 15 months respectively from receiptof the DCI.(iii) The time for submission of required residue chemistry data to supportthe continued use of captan for seed treatment use patterns was extendedby 1 year to July 6, 1989.(iv) Data on exposure to captan for fieldworkers and harvesters have recentlybeen received by EPA.The current reentry requirement (4 days) and protective clothing for fieldworkers and harvesters will be reassessed when these data have been evaluated.Additionally, as a result of uses being cancelled by this Notice and newresidue data available to EPA, tolerance reductions or revocations willbe proposed for a number of food commodities. This proposal regarding captantolerances will be published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>during 1989.This Notice is organized into eight units. Unit I. is an Introduction providingbackground information on captan, EPA actions prior to this Notice, andthe legal basis for these actions. Unit II. summarizes the toxicologicaldata base for captan and EPA's concerns regarding the hazard of oncogenicity.Unit III. presents EPA's assessment of dietary and non-dietary exposureto captan and their respective risks.

UnitVIII. lists references used in concluding this Special Review of captan.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Introduction</ITAG>Captan is the common name for N-trichloromethylthio-4-cyclohexene-1, 2-dicarboximide.Captan acts as a broad spectrum non-systemic protectant against fungaldiseases. There are approximately 320 federally registered pesticide productscontaining the active ingredient captan. These registrations are held by83 registrants. The major producers/ registrants of captan formed a CaptanTask Force, currently headed by ICI Americas, Inc., in order to generatetoxicological and residue data to support the continued registration ofselected uses of captan.There are more than 60 registered uses for captan which is also known asOrthocide, Vancide 89, Merpan and Agrox. Captan is used as a fungicideon many food crops especially almonds, tree fruits, and small berries andas a protectant for plant seeds. There are also several non-food agriculturaluses including ornamental plants and shrubs and cut flowers. Methods ofapplication for agricultural crops include ground and aerial foliar applications,seed treatments and post harvest treatments of tree fruits. Captan formulationsinclude dusts, wettable powders, aqueous suspensions and granules.In the United States, usage of captan is estimated at 10 million poundsof active ingredient (a.i.) per year. About 30 percent of the total a.i.sold is used on apples and about 28 percent on seed treatments. The nextlargest uses are cherries, peaches and nectarines which account for about25 percent of total a.i. sales each year.Available estimates indicate that captan is used on 60 percent of almondsharvested in the United States, on 85 percent of sweet cherries, and approximately50 percent of all apple acreage. Captan is used in the culture of about20 percent of California grapes and nearly 100 percent of Florida strawberriesare treated with captan. It is estimated that at least 75 percent of allvegetable seeds are treated with captan. From information received fromgrowers and grower associations, it is also likely that at least 25 percentof all small berries, including blueberries, blackberries and raspberriesare treated with captan. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)and the Captan Task Force have provided data indicating that the post-harvestuse of captan, particularly on apples, cherries and pears, is significant(Refs. 20 and 37). In the United States, at least 1 million tons of applesand approximately 261,000 tons of pears receive this treatment annually.Industry also estimates that about 30,000 of the 50,000 tons of cherriesexported from the State of Washington to Canada each year, and an additional17,000 tons sold on the the domestic market, are treated with a captan/benomylmixture. EPA estimates that captan is used alone or in combination withanother fungicide as a post-harvest treatment on approximately 25 percentof all apples, 35 percent of pears and 33 percent of cherries.Captan is also applied to packing boxes used for storing and shipping offruits and vegetables. Household uses of captan include applications tohome gardens and orchards. Captan is registered for use on ornamentals,including house plants. It is also used as a preservative or protectantfor awnings, draperies, and leather goods and is incorporated into paints,paper, paste (wallpaper flour), and plastic.A. Legal BackgroundBefore a pesticide product may be lawfully sold or distributed in eitherintrastate or interstate commerce, the product must be registered by EPA(FIFRA sections 3(a) and 12(a)(1)). A registration is a license allowinga pesticide product to be sold and distributed for specified use instructions,precautions, and other items and conditions.In order to obtain a registration for a pesticide under FIFRA, an applicantmust demonstrate that the pesticide satisfies the statutory standard forregistration. The standard requires, among other things, that the pesticideperform its intended function without causing ``unreasonable adverse effectson the environment,'' as defined in FIFRA section 2(bb), or any unreasonablerisk to man or the environment, taking into account the economic, socialand environmental costs and benefits of the use of any pesticide. Thisstandard requires a finding that the benefits of the use of the pesticideexceed the risks of use, when the pesticide is used in compliance withthe terms and conditions of registration or in accordance with commonlyrecognized practices.The burden of proving that a pesticide satisfies the statutory standardis on the proponents of registration and continues as long as the registrationremains in effect. Under FIFRA section 6, the Administrator may issue aNotice of Intent to Cancel the registration of a pesticide product wheneverit is determined that the pesticide product causes unreasonable adverseeffects on the environment. EPA created the Special Review process to facilitatethe identification of pesticide uses which may not satisfy the statutoryrequirements for registration and to provide an informal procedure to gatherand evaluate information about the risks and benefits of these uses.A Special Review is initiated if a pesticide meets or exceeds the riskcriteria set out in the regulations at 40 CFR Part 154. EPA announces thata Special Review is initiated by issuing a notice in the <T4>Federal Register. </T4>Registrants and other interested persons areinvited to review the data upon which the Special Review is based and tosubmit data and information to rebut EPA's conclusions by showing thatEPA's initial determination was in error, or by showing that use of thepesticide is not likely to result in any significant risk to human healthor the environment. In addition to submitting rebuttal evidence, personswishing to comment may submit relevant information to aid in the determinationof whether the economic, social and environmental benefits of the pesticideoutweigh the risks of use. After reviewing the comments received and otherrelevant material obtained during the Special Review process, EPA makesa decision on the future status of registrations of the pesticide.The Special Review process may be concluded in various ways depending uponthe outcome of EPA's risk/benefit assessment. If EPA concludes that allof its risks concerns have been adequately rebutted, the pesticide registrationwill be maintained unchanged. If, however, all risk concerns are not rebutted,EPA will proceed to a full risk/benefit assessment. In determining whetherthe use of a pesticide poses risks which are greater than its benefits,EPA considers possible changes to the terms and conditions of registrationwhich can reduce risks and the impacts of such modifications on the benefitsof use. If EPA determines that such changes reduce risks to the level wherethe benefits outweigh the risks, it may require that such changes be madein the terms and conditions of the registration. Alternatively, EPA maydetermine that no changes in the terms and conditions of a registrationwill adequately assure that use of the pesticide will not pose any unreasonableadverse effects. If EPA makes such a determination, it may seek suspension,and, if necessary, cancellation. In either case, EPA must issue a Noticeof Intent to Suspend or a Notice of Intent to Cancel the registration.If the Notice requires changes in the terms and conditions of registration,cancellation may be avoided by making the specified changes set forth inthe Notice, if possible. Adversely affected persons, including registrantsand applicants for registration may also request a hearing on the suspensionor cancellation of a specified registration and use, and if they do soin a legally effective manner that registration and use will be continuedpending a decision at the close of an administrative hearing.B. Regulatory History1. <T3>Rebuttable Presumption Against Registration.</T3> On August 18, 1980EPA issued a Notice of Rebuttable Presumption Against Registration (RPAR)and Continued Registration of Pesticide Products Containing Captan (45FR 54938). This action initiated what is now called the Special Reviewprocess. The need for a Special Review of captan was based on EPA's findingthat registration of pesticide products containing captan met the riskcriteria set forth in 40 CFR 162.11(a)(3) relating to oncogenicity andmutagenicity. Comments were solicited from registrants, applicants forregistration and the public, on EPA's finding that products containingcaptan met or exceeded these risk criteria.In the Notice initiating the Special Review, EPA also solicited evidenceon other possible adverse effects of captan that while not being the basesfor issuing the RPAR (referred to as Position Document 1 or PD 1), wereof concern.These effects included fetotoxicity/teratogenicity, hypersensitivity, andacute toxicity to aquatic wildlife.Registrants and applicants were required to submit evidence in rebuttalof the presumption against registration. EPA sought information regardingthe risks posed by captan to man or the environment and the benefits fromEPA registered uses of captan.2. <T3>Preliminary Notice of Determination and Notice of Intent to Cancel:Captan Position Document 2/3 June, 1985_</T3>a. <T3>Oncogenicity. </T3>This section provides a summary of EPA's proposeddecision (PD 2/3) on captan, issued in June, 1985 (Ref. 55). As part ofthe Special Review process, EPA reviewed all comments and data submittedin response to the captan RPAR/PD 1. Data submissions included additionalstudies of chronic exposure to captan in the mouse and rat. EPA evaluatedthese data and concluded that the studies showed statistically significantincreases in incidence of tumors in the gastrointestinal tract in mice(Refs. 4 and 7) and kidney tumors (benign and malignant combined) in malerats (Ref. 24).Using a weight-of-evidence approach, captan was classified as a Group B<T2>2</T2> (probable human) carcinogen under EPA proposed Guidelines forCarcinogen Risk Assessment (46 FR 46294, Nov. 23, 1984). Specifically,the criteria used were that there was sufficient evidence of an increasedincidence of tumors (a) in multiple species or strains of test animals;or (b) in multiple experiments, for example with different dose levelsor routes of administration; or (c) to an unusual degree in a single experimentwith regard to high incidence, unusual site or type of tumor, or earlystage of onset.The classification of captan as a Group B<T2>2</T2> carcinogen was based on data showing statistically and biologicallysignificant oncogenic responses in both sexes of mice (Refs. 4 and 7) andin male rats (Ref. 24). Supporting evidence included captan's structuralactivity relationship with folpet and captafol both of which have demonstratedoncogenic effects (Ref. 8) in certain laboratory animals; and captan'smutagenic effects in microbial systems and <T3>in vitro </T3>cell assays (Ref. 46).b. <T3>Dietary exposure and risk. </T3>EPA's principal concern was the riskof cancer to humans through dietary exposure to captan. Adequate residuedata upon which EPA could base an estimate of dietary risk were not availableat the time Position Document 2/3 (PD 2/3) was issued. Therefore EPA usedthe highest residue levels that are legally permissible, the tolerancelevels, as a basis for the dietary risk estimates. Risks were also basedon a worst-case assumption that 100 percent of the food crops are treatedwith captan. Using this assumption, the upper bound estimate of total lifetimedietary risk for the total U.S. population is 10^4 to 10^3. A dietary oncogenicrisk of 10^3 means that statistically one additional case of cancer isestimated to occur for every 1,000 individuals as a result of ingestingcaptan residues in or on foods consumed.c. <T3>Non-dietary exposure and risk. </T3>EPA calculated the oncogenic riskfrom non-dietary exposure to captan. Without protective measures, the upperbound estimates of risk to agricultural applicators and mixer/loaders fromcombined dermal and inhalation exposure ranged from 10^7 to 10^5. Usingexposure data from studies of exposure to captan from picking strawberriesthat have been treated with captan, EPA's upper bound estimates of lifetimerisk for field workers ranged from 10^6 to 10^4.For non-agricultural end-users of non-food products containing captan,the upper bound estimates of risk included 10^5 to 10^4 for human exposureto pet shampoos (this use is no longer registered), 10^5 for exposure tocommercial applicators of oil-based paints (if no gloves are worn), and10^9 for aerosol sprays.d. <T3>Other toxicological concerns</T3>_i. <T3>Mutagenicity. </T3>As documented in the RPAR, captan has been shownto be mutagenic in <T3>in vitro </T3>experiments in lower organisms and the following <T3>in vitro </T3>mammalian cells in cultures: SV40 transformed human fibroblasts,chinese hamster lung fibroblasts, and in chinese hamster ovary V79 cells(this last study, Ref. 46, was not included in the RPAR).A heritable translocation study was performed by Stanford Research Institute(SRI) for EPA (Ref. 40). This study was described in the RPAR. One translocationwas found in the high dose group which would normally be sufficient toclassify captan as positive for heritable translocations; however one translocationwas also seen in the negative control group. This study has been evaluatedas negative, equivocal, or positive at various times. Before the PD 2/3was published, however, a committee of experts in the field of heritabletranslocation testing was formed by EPA. This group was charged with evaluatingall heritable translocation tests available to them. This group of expertshas evaluated the SRI captan heritable translocation study as negative(Ref. 14). EPA accepts their assessment of this study.In summary, as documented in the PD 2/3, captan has been shown to be mutagenicin <T3>in vitro</T3> experiments in lower organisms, but the results in the<T3>in vivo</T3> experiments were evaluated as negative. EPA concludesthat captan is either non-mutagenic <T3>in vivo</T3> or possesses such a low mutagenic capacity in the <T3>in vivo</T3> assays used for quantitative heritable mutagenic riskassessment that it is not possible to detect its mutagenic activity. Althoughcaptan may be able to cause somatic mutational events which are potentiallyassociated with captan's oncogenic problem, the risk to humans of heritablemutagenicity is extremely low or does not exist and does not warrant furthertesting at this time.ii. <T3>Fetotoxicity/teratogenicity.</T3> EPA remained concerned in the PD2/3 regarding the potential for fetotoxic/teratogenic effects from theuse of captan and three studies received after the RPAR/PD 1 was issuedwere discussed in the document. In one study in the rabbit, no teratogeniceffects were observed (Ref. 6), but two studies in the Golden Syrian Hamsterwere suggestive of teratogenicity but not conclusive (Refs. 15 and 39).EPA asked for additional information on the Golden Syrian Hamster studiesto help clarify the studies' findings.The registrant submitted additional information after EPA issued the PD2/3. EPA is now able to conclude that captan is not a teratogen.iii. <T3>Reproductive effects.</T3> In the PD 2/3, EPA expressed its concernsregarding the potential for reproductive effects resulting from dietaryexposure to captan. Laboratory animal studies demonstrated that captancaused a decrease in pup litter weights.In determining the acceptability of dietary risk, EPA typically calculatesthe maximum amount of residue a person should consume from a toxicologicalpoint of view and compares it to the amount of residue a person is likelyto consume. So long as the likely residue is less than the maximum allowed,risks are assumed to be acceptable. In the PD 2/3, the specific concernexpressed was that the theoretical maximum residue concentration (TMRC)exceeded the allowable daily intake (ADI) by 63 percent. In calculatingthe TMRC, EPA assumed that exposure to captan for a particular commodityoccurred at the tolerance level and that 100 percent of the commodity wastreated with captan.Since the issuance of the PD 2/3, EPA has reviewed data which allow fora better estimation of the actual dietary residues to which people arelikely to be exposed. Using the refined exposure estimates, EPA has nowcalculated that only 1.2 percent of the ADI is utilized for the overallU.S. population and that only 4.1 percent is utilized by the subpopulationwith the greatest exposure (i.e., non-nursing infants). EPA is consequentlyno longer concerned with captan's potential for reproductive effects.iv. <T3>Hypersensitivity.</T3> In issuing the RPAR/PD 1 on captan, EPA hadrequested additional information concerning the potential for allergicreactions to captan. EPA received no additional information before issuingthe PD 2/3 but did receive additional data after that time. Based on aprimary dermal irritation and sensitization study in the guinea pig, EPAhas now concluded that captan is a mild irritant and moderate skin sensitizer(Ref. 32). There have also been reports of workers exposed to captan whohave developed skin irritation. No additional data have been required byEPA. Based on these findings, EPA specified in the Registration Standardand amendments that labeling include the use of protective clothing. EPAalso specified that labelling of all manufacturing and end use productscontaining captan include the following statement: ``May cause allergicskin reaction.''v. <T3>Risks to aquatic organisms.</T3> EPA had expressed its concern in thecaptan RPAR/PD 1 about the toxicity of captan to aquatic organisms. Therainbow trout (<T3>Salmo gairdneri</T3>) and bluegill (<T3>Lepomis macrochirus</T3>) 96 hour LC<T2>50</T2> values are 73.2 (66.6-80.7) and 141 (119-167) ug/1 respectively.Comments were received from Stauffer Chemical Company point out that therisk criteria under 40 CFR 162.11 assume direct application to water andthat there are no registered aquatic uses of captan. Aquatic contaminationcould occur only indirectly i.e., through drift, runoff or leaching. Stauffer'srebuttal of the aquatic risk criterion was accepted by EPA (Ref. 45). Thereare no aquatic uses of captan and the available data show that captan hydrolyzesrapidly in water (half-life of 1 to 2 days, usually \1/2\ day or less (Ref.44). The potential risks from indirect contamination are likely to be localizedand would be expected to be minor.e. <T3>Preliminary benefit assessment.</T3> EPA conducted a preliminary analysisto assess the benefits associated with the use of captan. This analysiswas based on data made available by the USDA, registrants, and other sources.EPA assessed the economic impact for growers and consumers if captan werecancelled and an assessment was made of the likely shift to alternativedisease control programs. EPA expressed its concern that fungicides asa class present toxicological problems and that cancellation of captanmight encourage users to switch to alternative chemicals that are equallyor more toxic. However, for many chemicals the data base was incompleteand EPA was not able to judge the relative toxicities of the alternativesas compared to captan. Some of these data were later obtained as part ofEPA's Registration Standards process. This issue is addressed in Unit VIof this Notice which summarizes EPA's risk/benefit assessment and conclusionof this Special Review of captan.The benefits of captan were assessed in terms of the economic impacts whichwould result if its uses were cancelled and users were forced to employavailable alternatives. EPA concluded that there would be moderate economicimpacts on the ornamental plant industry due to the loss of captan useon carnations ($6 to $12.6 million). It was predicted that resistance tothe available alternatives to captan for carnations would build up within2 years. Moderate impacts were also expected to occur if captan were notavailable for the following uses: almonds ($1.4 million), apples ($0.9to $3.3 million), apricots ($0.4 to $0.7 million), bushberries ($3.5 to$4.0 million), nectarines ($0.7), peaches ($2.3 to $5.0 million) and strawberries($5.9 million). The impact if captan were not available as a seed treatmentwas estimated at up to $9.2 million overall, although the per acre impactwas estimated to be minor.Although not quantified, it was estimated that cancellation of home gardenuses of captan could result in an increase in the costs of disease controlas several of the alternatives to captan were more expensive.For all other uses, EPA estimated that if captan were not available theimpacts to growers and consumers would be minor. EPA did not expect anymeasurable impact on nationwide production or prices of food, or any otheraspect of the agricultural economy.f. <T3>Risk/benefit analysis and proposed regulatory action_</T3>i. <T3>Agricultural uses: food uses. </T3>As a result of EPA's review of therisks and benefits associated with the use of captan, the EPA issued aPosition Document (PD) 2/3 in which EPA proposed to cancel or deny registrationsof products containing captan for use on food and feed crops. However,it was proposed that food uses would be retained in EPA's final decisionon captan if data were submitted showing that captan residues in or onfood were sufficiently lower than the tolerances used in calculating dietaryexposure to captan in the PD 2/3, or that alternative application methodswould sufficiently reduce dietary exposure to captan. Captan was registered for use on seeds without submission of data to establishtolerances for the food and feed commodities derived from the treated seeds.In the PD 2/3, EPA assumed that the dietary risks to humans from residuesresulting from captan seed treatments would be insignificant. However,EPA took the position that seed treatments will result in residues in theraw agricultural commodity, and, in the absence of data to demonstrateotherwise, required the submission of data to establish appropriate tolerancesfor those residues. These data must be submitted to EPA by July 6, 1989.EPA decided to continue to allow the feeding of detreated corn seed tocattle and hogs up to 14 days before slaughter if the residues are lessthan 100 ppm. The tolerances that allow the feeding of captan detreatedcorn seed were established under a raw agricultural commodity toleranceregulation 40 CFR 180.103 and in conjunction with a feed additive toleranceregulation 40 CFR 186.500 (formerly codified as 21 CFR 581.65). These toleranceswere established under Final Rules published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of November 6, 1981 (46 FR 55091 and 46 FR 55113).However, while the <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice (46 FR 55091) which established the feedadditive tolerance mentions washing and roasting, thereby implying thatthese are acceptable methods of detreating the captan treated corn seed,EPA had inadequate data to support either method. These data were subsequentlyrequired by the captan Registration Standard issued in March, 1986. InJanuary, 1987, the American Seed Trade Association (ASTA) (who originallyrequested EPA to set the tolerances: EPA Pesticide Petition No. 3E1367and EPA Food Additive Petition No. 3E1367) proposed to EPA that ASTA wouldnot submit data supporting the feed additive tolerance but would insteaddevelop alternate disposal methods for captan treated corn seed (over-sowing/incineration)which would allow for the revocation of the feed tolerance for this use.The data were not submitted in support of this tolerance and EPA will proposeto revoke the feed additive tolerance through a Notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.ii. <T3>Agricultural uses: Non-food uses. </T3>EPA did not propose cancellationof non-food uses of captan. However, it proposed that the risks to applicators,mixer/loaders and field workers must be reduced by modifying the termsof registration. For applicators and mixer/loaders, EPA proposed that labelsbe amended to require them to wear impermeable gloves and dust masks. Forfield workers, EPA proposed that labels be amended to require the use ofwater resistant gloves such as leather or other synthetic materials whenworking in captan treated fields. It was estimated that these measureswould result in reducing the risk (by 80 percent) to 10^6 for applicatorsand mixer/loaders and (by 90 percent) to 10^5 to 10^7 for field workers.iii. <T3>Non-agricultural uses. </T3>The risks to industrial mixer/loaders andapplicators incorporating captan into plastics, paints and cosmetics wereestimated as negligible as long as they wear protective clothing and dustmasks. The risk to mixer/loader/applicators incorporating captan into adhesiveswas estimated at 10^5 and EPA proposed to require the use of protectiveclothing or equipment during this procedure which would reduce the riskto adhesive applicators significantly (by 80 to 90 percent). EPA proposedthat gloves, protective clothing and respirators be required at all phasesof the application process (dust masks for incorporation into cosmetics)for all non-agricultural uses.EPA also calculated the potential oncogenic risks to users of non-foodend-use products containing captan. For exposure to captan treated plasticsand to captan treated packing boxes, the risks were estimated to be negligible.The risks from certain end-use products were low enough that EPA proposedno regulatory action. For example, the risks from exposure to surface spraysand pet powders containing captan were estimated at 10^9 and 10^8, respectively,and EPA concluded that the benefits outweighed the risks from using theseproducts. The benefits of the availability of sanitizing deodorant powderedhand soap containing 0.87 percent captan (Vancide 89) as an antimicrobialagent were also believed to outweigh the risks which were estimated, usinga worst-case scenario, at 10^6 to 10^5. EPA expects actual risks to belower because hands are typically rinsed off right away. In addition, thepresence of captan controls bacteria and fungi, which could degrade theproduct, and pathogenic bacteria which could lead to infections.Risks from direct exposure to captan treated mattresses and pillows werecalculated at 10^6 to 10^5. However, it was estimated that the risks wouldbe at least an order of magnitude lower and range from 10^7 to 10^6 sincesheets and pillowcases are usually used over these products. No regulatoryaction was proposed for captan treated mattresses and pillows.Risks from use of captan treated adhesives was estimated at 10^7 to 10^6for home use and 10^5 for professional uses. No regulatory action was proposedas the benefits were believed to outweigh the risks from captan treatedadhesives.EPA estimated the risk from exposure to water-based paint containing captanto be 10^6 and that the benefits outweighed the risk. Exposure to oil-basedpaint was estimated at 10^5 for commercial applicators and EPA proposedthat the labels for this use be amended to require that impermeable glovesbe worn during application. It was estimated that the use of impermeablegloves would reduce risks by 80 percent and would result in the risks fromoil-based paints being outweighed by the benefits.The use of gloves was also proposed to reduce the risks from exposure todog and cat shampoos containing captan. It was estimated that the calculatedrisks of from 10^5 to 10^4 would be reduced to 10^6 to 10^5. (There areno remaining registrations for pet shampoos.) Exposure to pet powders containingcaptan was estimated at 10^8 and EPA did not propose the use of gloveswith this product. Although powders were erroneously mentioned with shampoosin the PD 2/3 Unit IV.E.3.b.4, Unit IV.F.3.d.2 correctly summarized EPA'sproposed action regarding pet powders and shampoos. EPA considered thatthe benefits outweighed the risks from these captan uses.3. <T3>Registration Standard and Data Call-In.</T3> In March, 1986, as partof EPA's Registration Standards program, EPA published the Guidance forthe Reregistration of Pesticide Products Containing Captan (referred toas the Registration Standard). Certain deficiencies in the captan database were identified during EPA's initial assessment of this chemical.A Data Call-In Notice (DCI) was issued on April 29, 1985, requesting residuechemistry and toxicological data. In addition to these data, the RegistrationStandard identified data gaps in the following areas: product chemistry,toxicology, environmental fate, wildlife and aquatic organisms and residuechemistry. The Registration Standards program involves a thorough reviewof the scientific data base underlying pesticide registrations and theidentification of essential but missing studies which may not have beenrequired when the product was initially registered, or studies that arenow considered insufficient. As part of the Registration Standards program,all currently available data on a pesticide active ingredient are reviewedand evaluated and are considered in the development of EPA's regulatoryposition on the pesticide.4. <T3>Captan Registration Standard_Amendments.</T3> On April 25, 1986, EPAagain notified all registrants of manufacturing-use products (MPs) containingcaptan of the data submissions required by the Registration Standard.In response to EPA's issuing the captan Registration Standard, registrantsof technical captan formed a Captan Task Force (initially called the CaptanTask Group). The Task Force represented the three major manufacturers ofcaptan: Chevron Chemical Company, Stauffer Chemical Company (replaced byICI Americas, Inc. in 1987) and Makhteshim-Agan (America), Inc. These registrantsagreed to share the responsibility and costs of developing the data identifiedas data gaps in the Registration Standard; however, the Captan Task Forceindicated to EPA that they would only develop the residue data requiredto support the continued registration for certain specific food crop uses. On April 24, 1987, all registrants were mailed a copy of the captan RegistrationStandard and a Data Call-In amendment which notified registrants that theCaptan Task Force did not intend to develop data for all captan registrations.The end-use registrants, who had not received the Registration Standardinitially, were given 90 days to respond to EPA if they intended to developthese data; if not, the unsupported food use patterns were to be deletedfrom all EPA-registered captan product labels.  Registrants were also notified that EPA had reevaluated certain data requirementsrequired by the Registration Standard and that these requirements werebeing amended. These amendments reflected EPA's agreement to requests madeby the Captan Task Force regarding the relabeling of existing stocks. Therequired time limits for the relabeling of existing stocks of registeredcaptan products in the channels of trade was extended by 1 year. The changeswere required to be in effect by March, 1988. An additional extension of1 year, until March, 1989, was granted in January, 1988.  EPA also clarified and expanded some protective clothing and precautionarylabeling changes mandated in the Registration Standard. For example, theearlier requirement that ``impermeable gloves'' be worn while handlingcaptan products was amended to ``chemical resistant gloves''. The requiredendangered species precautionary statements were deleted to reflect anAgency-wide delay in implementing its endangered species policy. In addition,a crop rotation restriction was removed.  5. <T3>Notice of Intent to Suspend. </T3>A Notice of Intent to Suspend (NOIS)was issued on December 7, 1988. This NOIS was sent to all registrants informingthem of EPA's intent to suspend certain formulations and agricultural foodand feed use patterns of captan products for which residue chemistry datahad been required by the Data Call-In or the captan Registration Standard,but had not been provided. Registrants were initially given 30 days torespond to this Notice or to request a hearing. However, because of a technicalerror on the part of EPA, this Notice of Intent to Suspend is being revoked.Registrants will be notified of the revocation. EPA is considering issuinga new Notice of Intent to Suspend the agricultural uses for which residuedata have not been received. This suspension action, part of the RegistrationStandards program, is authorized under FIFRA 3(c)(2)(B) and is independentof the Special Review and risk/benefit assessment of captan.  6. <T3>Conclusion of Special Review (PD/4). </T3>EPA's assessment and finaldecision regarding the risks and benefits associated with products containingcaptan are set forth in this document. The EPA has received additionaldata and comments in response to EPA's Position Document regarding captan(PD 2/3, June 1985). This information is summarized and included in theappropriate Units of this document along with EPA's response.<ITAG tagnum="85">II. Summary of Toxicological Concerns and Agency Evaluation of Commentsand Additional Data</ITAG>A. Oncogenicity  This Unit documents EPA's review of studies of the oncogenic effects ofcaptan and EPA's classification of captan as a B<T2>2</T2> (probable human) carcinogen. This Unit also includes publiccomments on oncogenicity that have been received since EPA's proposed decisionconcerning captan was issued in June, 1985.  1. <T3>Rebuttable Presumption Against Registration (RPAR) and PD 2/3. </T3>TheRebuttable Presumption Against Registration, or RPAR (now known as theSpecial Review process) of captan was initiated in 1980 because of EPA'sconcerns regarding the oncogenic effects of captan demonstrated in laboratoryanimal feeding studies. One study in mice showed significantly elevatedincidences of duodenal tumors in males and females following 20-month oraladministrations of captan (Ref. 35). Another study showed an increasedincidence of hepatomas in males only following 18-month oral administrationsof captan (Ref. 22). Preliminary results of a 2-year feeding study availableat the time appeared to confirm an increased incidence of duodenal tumorsamong mice fed captan (Ref. 7). Two long-term rat studies resulted in nosignificantly increased levels of tumors (Refs. 35 and 18). One rat study(IBT B9267) and one mouse study (IBT B9271) were determined to be invalidby a joint United States/Canadian governmental audit and were not usedin evaluating captan's oncogenicity (Ref. 3).  In response to EPA's initiation of the Special Review, the registrant submittedcomments regarding the oncogenicity of captan and EPA's evaluation of data.EPA responded to these comments in detail in the Captan PD 2/3 of June,1985. EPA concluded that the concern for oncogenicity for captan had notbeen rebutted. Additional studies were also received from registrants andwere evaluated by EPA. The additional information on oncogenicity includedthree long-term feeding studies submitted by the registrants: a high-dosestudy using CD-1 mice (Ref. 7); a low-dose study in Charles River CD-1mice (Ref. 4); and a 2-year feeding study in Charles River CD rats (Ref.24). A detailed discussion of those studies is presented in the CaptanPD 2/3.The data from these studies demonstrate a statistically and biologicallysignificant oncogenic response in both sexes of mice and in male rats.Tumors include adenomas (benign) and adenocarcinomas (malignant) of thegastrointestinal tract in both sexes of mice and kidney tumors in malerats. As further supporting evidence of oncogenicity, EPA noted that captanhas mutagenic activity <T3>in vitro</T3> and is structurally similar to two other chemicals, folpetand captafol. Both of these are also oncogenic in laboratory animals anddemonstrate mutagenic effects in <T3>in vitro</T3> systems. Thus, using a weight-of-the-evidence approach, and following the classificationscheme set forth in EPA's Carcinogenic Risk Assessment Guidelines (proposed:November 23, 1984, 49 FR 46294; finalized: September 24, 1986, 51 FR 33992),captan was categorized as a B2 (probable human) carcinogen. The overallpotency or Q<T2>1</T2>* value for captan was estimated by calculating the geometricmean of the five Q<T2>1</T2>* values for male and female mice in two studies (Refs. 4 and7) and for male rats (Ref. 23). The resulting Q<T2>1</T2>* for captan was 2.3 x 10^3 (mg/kg/day)^1 (PD 2/3 Unit II.2).The rationale for combining organ sites and tumor types is outlined inthe National Toxicology Program_Board of Scientific Counselors Meeting,September 23 and 24, 1982 (Ref. 51). In accordance with section 6 of FIFRA, EPA's proposed decision to cancelcertain uses of captan due to the identified risks of oncogenicity, wassubmitted to the FIFRA Scientific Advisory Panel (SAP) for review. An openmeeting was held by the SAP on September 26, 1985. The SAP's report ofOctober 4, 1985, is reprinted in its entirety in Unit V. of this Notice.One issue raised with the SAP was whether the panel agreed with EPA;s qualitativeassessment (i.e. weight-of-the-evidence conclusions) of the oncogenic potentialof captan. After reviewing the evidence, the SAP's findings were that onemouse study demonstrates oncogenic effects in the duodenum of mice exposedto a high dose of captan (Ref. 7); and that two other studies are lessconvincing, but supportive because they indicate tumors at the same site(Refs. 4 and 35). The Panel found the rat studies equivocal, at best, inindicating oncogenicity. The SAP was also asked to comment on EPA's calculation of the geometricmean of the Q<T2>1</T2>*s from five oncogencity studies to determine the potency value(Q<T2>1</T2>*) for captan. The Panel expressed its reservations about EPA'sprocedures and assumptions in determining and using Q<T2>1</T2>* values. Their specific criticism of the way EPA had calculatedthe Q<T2>1</T2>* for captan was that the geometric mean was calculated usingstudies that were not of equal value. EPA's reevaluation of the studiesshowing captan's oncogenic effects and calculations of a new Q<T2>1</T2>* for captan are discussed in Unit II.A.4. and 6. of this Notice.2. <T3>Registrants comments on the PD 2/3.</T3> Stauffer Chemical Companyand Chevron Chemical Company submitted their comments on the Captan PD2/3 in August, 1985. Both companies have essentially the same discussionsas related to the toxicology and risk assessment of captan. These commentsand EPA's response to these issues are summarized below: a. The registrants expressed their opinion that captan is not carcinogenicin rats. They submitted historical control data and stated that the EPAfocused on only one of three chronic rat feeding studies: The IRDC, 1982study. In this study, although the evidence for oncogenicity is poor, thereis a positive statistical trend for renal tumors in males; however, thereare no statistically significant pair-wise comparisons between any treatmentgroup and the controls. The two other rat studies are negative. <T3>EPA response: </T3>EPA disagrees with the registrant and maintainsthat captan may be considered weakly oncogenic in the IRDC rat study. EPAused the more sensitive Cochran-Armitrage trend test, rather than the Fisher'spair-wise exact test for statistical significance. The trend test utilizesinformation from all experimental groups which becomes more important asthe number of dosed groups increases. In addition, the structure activity relationship of captan should alsobe considered. Captafol, a pesticide cancelled voluntarily by the registrantin 1987 after a Special Review had been initiated, has the same ring structureas captan, and is also initially metabolized to tetrahydrophthalimide (THPI).The lesions of concern, renal cortical tubular adenomas and carcinomashave been observed to increase in frequency with increasing doses of captafolin the same strain of rat (Charles River CD) as in the IRDC 1982 studyon captan. This evidence adds support to the position that the renal lesionmay be related to the ingestion of captan and the subsequent metabolismto a derivative of the THPI moiety. The IRDC rat historical control data referred to by the registrant in supportof their argument that captan is not carcinogenic in the rat, indicatethat the average incidence of renal cortical neoplasms is 0.6 percent inmale rats, based on a male population of 1279 (14 studies). The range isfrom 0 to 3.9 percent. This is lower than the incidence in the high dosegroup after captan treatment (4/57, or 7 percent, had renal tumors (excludingrats from the 1-year sacrifice)). The concurrent male control group ofthe captan rat study also had a renal tumor incidence of 1/60, or 1.7 percentwhich is within the range of historical values. Therefore the renal tumorsare considered related to treatment. In summary, EPA's position that captan may be considered weakly oncogenicin the rat is supported by the following evidence: (a) There are statisticallysignificant differences when the trend test is used instead of the lesssensitive pair-wise comparisons; (b) captan's structure activity relationshipto captafol which also appears to be associated with a slight increasein the incidence of renal cortical neoplasia; and (c) the incidence ofrenal tumors in male controls of the captan study is within the range ofthe historical control data while the incidence of tumors in the high dosegroup is outside both the historical and concurrent control range.b. Chevron/Stauffer claimed that no oncogenic effects were observed atdoses of up to and including 800 ppm in the mouse (Ref. 4).<T3>EPA response: </T3>Captan is associated with gastrointestinal tumorsat doses of 6000 ppm and above in 3 studies in the mouse (Refs. 4 and 7).Although the data do not unequivocally indicate oncogenic potential atlower doses, they are suggestive of such potential. EPA combined tumorsof the glandular stomach, duodenum, jejunum and ileum in the PD 2/3. Thispractice of combining various organs is controversial, as the registrantindicated. EPA cited a National Toxicology Program Board of ScientificCounselors Meeting (September, 1982) which presented a list of acceptableorgan combinations including glandular tissues of the stomach and smallintestine. Stauffer also quotes from the same document that neoplasia ofthe glandular stomach is usually evaluated independently. Separation ofthe stomach data, however, does not significantly alter the conclusions.The primary issue raised by Stauffer is whether or not EPA recognizes athreshold in carcinogenesis for intestinal tumors due to captan. In orderfor a threshold mechanism to be considered in analyzing oncogenicity data,several criteria need to be met and although it may be possible that athreshold does exist for intestinal tumors due to captan, the data supportingthis position do not yet exist. Examples of information that may aid inassessing whether a threshold for captan carcinogenicity exists are asfollows: (a) Extensive testing at low doses demonstrating the absence ofpre-neoplastic or neoplastic changes below the alleged threshold level;(b) an identified change in metabolism or a secondary mechanism that occursonly at higher doses: this high dose model in the laboratory animal mustbe shown to be applicable in assessing potential oncogenicity in man; and(c) the nature of the oncogenic compound or metabolite must be identifiedand its presence demonstrated only at levels above the alleged threshold.c. Stauffer stated that the current epidemiological data do not supporta captan-related oncogenic risk to man. They cited a retrospective cohortepidemiologic study involving workers at the Calhio plant where technicalcaptan is manufactured.<T3>EPA response: </T3>The epidemiological study performed at the Calhioplant indicated that mortality due to malignant neoplasms was not increased.Although deaths (18) appeared greater than expected based on the nationalaverage (11), the increase was related to cardiovascular effects ratherthan neoplasia. This study, however, has several shortcomings. Only 16of the employees were exposed to captan for longer than 20 years. The smallpopulation examined (134 males), small number of deaths (18 males), andshort observation period (23 years) make it difficult to determine theoncogenic potential of captan in the workplace. Although the age-adjustedtable for malignant neoplasms of the small intestine indicates that theincidence has stabilized (.3), this is an insensitive indicator.3. <T3>Other comments on oncogenicity. </T3>The Natural Resources DefenseCouncil, Inc. (NRDC) and the California Rural Legal Assistance Foundation(CRLAF) submitted their amended comments in response to EPA's PD 2/3 onAugust 12, 1985. They stated their opinion that captan is a carcinogenproducing statistically significant increases in tumor incidence in bothsexes of mice and in male rats.<T3>EPA response: </T3>The NRDC/CRLAF are correct in stating that captanproduced adenocarcinomas of the digestive tract in both sexes of mice inthree studies, and that this tumor type is not commonly observed in rodents.They also state that kidney tumors were observed in male rats in one study.EPA has determined that these rat data show only a borderline increasein kidney tumors; however, this increase was taken into consideration indetermining the oncogenicity classification and risks from captan. EPAsupports the classification of captan as a B<T2>2</T2> (probable human) carcinogen.4. <T3>Toxicology Branch Peer Review. </T3>The Office of Pesticide Program'sToxicology Branch Peer Review Committee reviewed the oncogenicity dataon captan in December, 1985. The committee considered the criteria in EPA'sproposed guidelines for classifying a carcinogen (49 FR 46294). After carefulreevaluation of all the evidence, the committee determined that captanmeets all the criteria for category B<T2>2</T2>, any one of which alone can be sufficient for such classification.The evidence for carcinogenicity includes the following: (a) Captan producesan increased incidence of renal cortical tubular cell neoplasms in maleCharles River CD rats and an increased incidence of uterine sarcomas inWistar rats; (b) captan produces an increased incidence of intestinal neoplasmsin B6C3F<T2>1</T2> mice; in ICR-Derived CD-1 mice, tumors appeared early and thereis a dose-related trend for both sexes; and in Charles River CD-1 mice(tumors appeared after 9 months); and (c) captan demonstrated mutagenicactivity and is structurally related to two oncogens (captafol and folpet),which also have mutagenic activity.5. <T3>Captan Task Force rebuttal of the Toxicology Branch Peer Review. </T3>TheCaptan Task Force, formed by the registrants, submitted their rebuttalto the Toxicology Branch Peer Review of captan. They expressed their opinionthat there is no substantive evidence that captan presents a risk as ahuman oncogen. They held that the nature of the murine intestinal tumors,the lack of credible systemic tumors elsewhere (either in the mouse orthe rat) and an evaluation of the probable mechanism of action, all leadto the conclusion that captan is not a probable human carcinogen. The argumentspresented by the Captan Task Force are addressed below.a. <T3>Oncogenicity of captan in rats. </T3>i. The Task Force stated thatEPA's use of the Cochran-Armitage trend test to evaluate kidney tumorsin the two-year oral toxicity carcinogenicity study of captan in CharlesRiver CD rats (Ref. 24) is inappropriate because the incidence is too low.They noted that pair-wise comparison indicates no significant increasein the incidence of renal tumors in this study.<T3>EPA response: </T3>Several factors are considered in determining therelevance of increased tumor incidence, including the percent increasein tumors over concurrent and historical controls as well as pair-wiseand trend statistical analyses. In this case, the incidence of renal tumorsin male Charles River CD rats was increased over both concurrent (treated_7percent vs control_2 percent, excluding animals sacrificed at 1 year anddeaths prior to 1 year) and historical controls for 14 studies (1279 rats).Historical controls for adenomas ranged from 0 to 1.7 percent with a meanof 0.4 percent, while the range for adenocarcinomas was 0 to 2.1 percentwith a mean of 0.2 percent. Therefore, while the Task Force is correctthat the pair-wise comparison is not statistically significant, the incidenceappears to be treatment related. EPA agrees with the registrant that theCochran-Armitage trend test may be inappropriate with low tumor incidence;however, it would not alter the conclusion that renal tumors are associatedwith the administration of captan in this study since (i) it is a raretumor; and (ii) incidences are outside the historical and concurrent controlranges.ii. The Task Force held that there was absolutely no evidence of renaltumors in the other two chronic rat studies at very high dose levels: Abioassay of captan for possible carcinogenicity in Osborne-Mendel rats(Ref. 35) with doses up to 6050 ppm (time weighted average); and a Life-Spanoral carcinogenicity study of captan (Merpan) in Wistar Cpb:Wu rats (Ref.34) at doses of 2000 ppm.<T3>EPA response: </T3>The three rat studies were performed on 3 differentstrains, Charles River CD, Osborne Mendel and Wistar Cpb:Wu rats. Therefore,they cannot be considered as replicates of the same study. Two negativeswould not necessarily neutralize one positive study. In addition, Chevronhas recently submitted a subchronic inhalation study in the CD rat in whichrenal lesions (hyaline droplet nephropathy) occurred at all doses. Theliterature indicates that this lesion has on occasion been associated withlow level increases in renal tumors.iii. The Task Force disagreed with EPA's finding on the incidence of uterinesarcomas. They found that induction of uterine sarcomas in the Wistar rat(Ref. 34) was not confirmed in studies of the Osborne Mendel rat (Ref.35) or the Charles River CD rat (Ref. 24).<T3>EPA response: </T3>Again, EPA does not accept that two negative studiesin different strains of the rat would neutralize one positive study. Inaddition, the incidence (8 percent) of uterine sarcomas in the high doseWistar Cpb:Wu rats is substantially above concurrent controls (0 percent)and historical controls (based on 7 studies, 422 rats, range of 0-2 percent,mean 0.2 percent). In the absence of additional information, captan willbe considered a weak oncogen for uterine sarcomas in this strain of rat.Therefore captan appears to be a potential, albeit weak, rat oncogen.b. <T3>Oncogenicity of captan in mice. </T3>The following comments were submittedby the Captan Task Force regarding the oncogenicity of captan in the mouse.i. Captan is rapidly detoxified in mammals via two mechanisms. First, thiol-containingcompounds such as gluthione react with captan, and secondly, hydrolysis,particularly rapid at alkaline pH levels, serves to neutralize captan.The active moiety, thiophosgene, formed during captan metabolism, can berapidly detoxified by additional reaction with thiol groups. Other reactionswith sulphate and water (hydrolysis) also serve to neutralize the thiophosgene.ii. Studies on the effects of captan show local, not systemic tumors. Therapid detoxification/hydrolysis of captan noted above prevents the parentcompound from entering the systemic circulation.iii. There is no bioaccumulation of captan or its metabolites.iv. Large oral doses of captan give no evidence of clastogenic damage inthe target tissue (duodenal mucosa) as noted by Chidiac and Goldberg (Ref.10).<T3>EPA response: </T3>EPA agrees with the Task Force that captan doesappear to be rapidly metabolized; that tumors in mice are localized inthe intestines; and that there is no bioaccumulation in, or clastogenicdamage to, the duodenal mucosal cells. However, these factors do not alterthe fact that tumors do occur in mice. These factors do not provide a basisfor altering the oncogenic classification of captan.c. <T3>The structure activity relationship of captan with captafol and folpet.</T3>The Task Force disagreed with EPA's finding that the increase in renaltumor incidence at a dose level of 1200 ppm in a study of captafol supportsEPA's position that captan causes renal tumors. Captafol induces renaltumors only at a dose level that also produces renal tubular cell toxicityand therefore the tumors are attributable to prolonged injury and repairin the kidney. The Task Force finds that there is no evidence that captanproduces similar toxicity.<T3>EPA response: </T3>The structure activity relationship between chemicalsis not used to determine the classification of an oncogen but rather assupporting evidence for its classification, depending on the strength ofthe information. In the case of captan, there is a structural relationshipwith the fungicides captafol and folpet. As was mentioned above, it hasbeen demonstrated that administration of captan (by a different route ofexposure) is associated with renal tubular cell changes. These cell changeshave, for other chemicals, been associated with low level increases ofrenal cortical tumors.6. <T3>Toxicology Branch Second Peer Review. </T3>The Office of PesticideProgram's Peer Review committee met on April 13, 1988 to reevaluate theclassification of captan as a B<T2>2</T2> oncogen, and to determine if the Q<T2>1</T2>* used in the PD 2/3 is still appropriate. In the PD 2/3, theQ<T2>1</T2>* (potency) for captan was calculated using a geometric meanbased on the Q<T2>1</T2>*s from the following studies: male and female mice in a highdose study (Ref. 7) male and female mice in a low dose study (Ref. 4);and from one study of the male rat (Ref. 24).In reviewing EPA's PD 2/3 on captan, the Scientific Advisory Panel hadnot found EPA's approach to calculating the Q<T2>1</T2>* for captan useful because the five studies used to calculatethe geometric mean were not of equal value.EPA's initial position in response to the SAP reservations was that althoughthe studies do vary qualitatively, the Q<T2>1</T2>* for each study is sufficiently similar that using a differentsystem of establishing the Q<T2>1</T2>* for captan would not make a practical difference.During the Second Peer Review of captan the committee examined EPA's laboratoryaudit of the Bio/dynamics (Ref. 4) 2-year mouse feeding study referredto as the low-dose study. The low incidence of tumors at the highest doseof 6000 ppm in this study was not consistent with the incidence of intestinaltumors at this dose level in both the Chevron (Ref. 7) study and a Stauffersingle dose (6000 ppm) study submitted since the PD 2/3 was issued. Theaudit suggests that there was a problem with achieving and maintainingthe appropriate dose levels throughout the Bio/dynamics study (Ref. 4).In determining the overall Q<T2>1</T2>* for captan, the committee decided to omit the Q<T2>1</T2>* values based on the Bio/dynamics study and the Q<T2>1</T2>* value based on the rat kidney tumors which the SAP had foundequivocal. The new overall Q<T2>1</T2>* for captan, based only on the Chevron (Ref. 7) high dose studyin male and female mice (geometric mean) is 3.6andmultiply;10^3.The committee reaffirmed the classification of captan as a B<T2>2</T2> (probable human) carcinogen based on tumors in two species,mutagenicity and structural activity relationships.B. MutagenicityIn initiating a special review of captan, EPA concluded that on the basisof the information then available to EPA, captan exceeded the risk criteriafor mutagenicity (45 FR 54938, August 18, 1980). As discussed in Unit Iof this Notice, the Toxicology Branch evaluated additional data on mutagenicityprior to issuing the PD 2/3 on captan in 1985. EPA determined that captanshows positive mutagenic activity in gene mutation and chromosomal aberrationtests <T3>in vitro </T3>but not <T3>in vivo. </T3>Therefore, EPA concluded that although captan may causesomatic mutational events which are potentially associated with captan'soncogenic potential, the risk to humans of heritable mutagenicity is extremelylow or does not exist and does not warrant further testing at this time.Subsequent evaluation of the mutagenicity data by the Toxicology BranchPeer Review Committee has confirmed EPA's PD 2/3 on the mutagenic potentialof captan. The studies on the mutagenicity of captan lend significant supportto its classification as an oncogen, but there is little or no risk ofits producing mutagenic effects in humans.C. TeratogenicityInformation available to EPA prior to the issuance of a Notice initiatingthe Special Review of captan, indicated that captan might produce otheradverse effects including teratogenicity (45 FR 54938). Studies reviewedand evaluated prior to the PD 2/3 included a study in New Zealand whiterabbits (Ref. 6) in which no teratogenic effects were observed, and twostudies in the Golden Hamster which were suggestive of teratogenicity butnot conclusive (Refs. 15 and 39). A Data Call-In (April, 1985) requiredthe submission of another teratology study in the hamster.Comments on the teratogenicity of captan were submitted by the registrant,Stauffer Chemical Company, in August, 1985. The registrant said that theRoben's hamster study which EPA had cited as being suggestive of teratogenicity,was not consistent with EPA Guidelines. The registrant's position was thatcaptan had been tested exhaustively for potential teratogenicity in mice,hamsters, rats, rabbits and rhesus monkeys and had not been shown to beteratogenic in any species. It was their opinion that an additional hamsterteratology study was unnecessary.<T3>EPA response: </T3>After the PD 2/3 was issued, additional historicaldata on the Golden Syrian hamster were submitted by the registrant. EPA'sevaluation of these data resulted in the Goldenthal, IRDC study classificationbeing upgraded to core minimum (a classification which means that the studyis scientifically sound but incomplete), which then satisfied the guidelinerequirement for developmental data in one species. Thus, there is no needfor another teratology study in the hamster required in the 1985 Data Call-InNotice. A teratogenicity study in rabbits was also considered core minimum.There were no indications of teratogenic effects in either species.EPA's assessment that captan is not a teratogen in the hamster or the rat(based on Agency accepted studies) was reviewed by the SAP in September,1985 and the Panel concurred with EPA's judgement.D. Reproductive Effects1. <T3>Agency's data evaluation and risk assessment. </T3>EPA's preliminaryrisk assessment for reproductive effects was based on a three generationstudy in COBS CD rats (Ref. 24) and a one generation rat study (Ref. 25).While neither the three nor the one generation study was adequate in itselfdue to the dose selection in each study, each study provided sufficientinformation for EPA to reach a scientific conclusion on the reproductivetoxicity potential of captan. These studies satisfy EPA's reproductiontesting requirements.No compound-related effects were seen at any dosage level in the one-generationstudy in which captan was given in the diet at dosage levels of 0, 6, 12.5,and 25 mg/kg/day. In the three-generation study, captan was administeredin the diet at dosage levels of 0, 25, 100, and 500 mg/kg/day. No treatment-relatedeffects were seen in this study with the exception of a reduction in bodyweight and food consumption. The reduced parental (male and female) weightgain and reduced food consumption occurred in all but the low dose groups.There was a treatment-related decrease in food consumption in all pup groupsexcept for the 25 mg/kg/day, F1 (first generation) males and F2 (secondgeneration) females, and 100 mg/kg/day females. A decrease in pup litterweights was observed at all dosage levels. The NOEL for toxic effects is12.5 mg/kg/day and the LEL is 25 mg/kg/day.A new chronic dog study was recently received and reviewed by EPA. Althoughthis study is classified core grade supplementary (scientifically soundbut incomplete), it is sufficient to complete the required data base forthe Reference Dose (RfD). These data show that the rat remains the moresensitive species.To determine whether there is an adequate margin of safety (MOS) betweenthe NOEL for toxic effects and dietary residue levels to which humans mightbe exposed, EPA calculates the Reference dose (RfD), formerly called theAcceptable Daily Intake (ADI). The RfD is based on the most sensitive NOELand an uncertainty factor used to account for the interspecies and intraspeciesdifferences and data gaps.In the PD 2/3, an uncertainty factor of 1,000 was used because of the incompletedata base. Since the data base is now complete, an uncertainty factor of100 is used with the most sensitive NOEL (12.5 mg/kg/day). The resultingRfD is 1.25andmultiply;10^\1\ mg/kg/day and is discussed in Unit III.A ofthis Notice which concerns dietary exposure to captan.2. <T3>Comments in response to the PD 2/3.</T3> NRDC/CRLAF expressed theirconcern about the adequacy of the reproduction studies on which EPA hadbased their estimate of Margins of Safety (MOS).<T3>EPA response:</T3> As stated earlier, EPA recognizes that each studyhad deficiencies. However, when the two studies are considered together,they provide sufficient information regarding captan's reproductive toxicitypotential that additional studies are not needed.EPA believes, as described earlier in this Unit, that when taken togetherthe two reproduction studies submitted by the registrants and describedabove have satisfied the guideline requirement for data on reproductioneffects.E. Other Toxicological Concerns1. <T3>The captan metabolite, tetrahydrophthalimide (THPI)</T3>_<T3>Comments in response to the PD 2/3.</T3> a. NRDC/CRLAF commented thatit is now widely recognized that metabolites of pesticide active ingredientscan be potentially as dangerous, if not more dangerous, than the parentcompound. They stated that although EPA had correctly considered the metaboliteTHPI in addition to the parent compound, the existing toxicity data baseon this metabolite was inadequate.b. Industry's Captan Task Force commented that the major metabolite (plantand animal) of captan, tetrahydrophthalimide (THPI) has not been implicatedas a carcinogen and is not a mutagen.<T3>EPA response:</T3> The toxicity of a plant metabolite is consideredto be examined when the parent is tested in animal toxicity studies, sinceany toxicity detected in the study could result from the metabolite aswell as the parent, provided that the metabolite is also an animal metabolite.Since THPI is produced both in plants and in animals, EPA believes theavailable data base is sufficient to reflect the oncogenic potential ofTHPI.2. <T3>Hypersensitivity.</T3> In initiating a Special Review of captan, EPAwas aware that there were some data associating captan with allergic skinreactions. EPA received no additional information before issuing the PD2/3. Based on a primary dermal irritation and sensitization study in theguinea pig, EPA concluded that captan is a mild irritant and moderate skinsensitizer (Ref. 33). There have also been reports of workers exposed tocaptan who have developed skin irritation.Based on these findings, EPA specified in the Registration Standard andamendments that labeling for captan products include protective clothing.EPA also specified that labelling of all manufacturing and end use productscontaining captan include the following statement: ``May cause allergicskin reaction.''<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Dietary and Non-Dietary Exposure and Risk</ITAG>A. Dietary Exposure and RiskIn the captan PD 2/3, EPA assumed food residues were at tolerance levelsand that 100 percent of a crop was treated in order to estimate dietaryexposure of the U.S. population to captan. Exposure was estimated to be0.1169 mg/kg (body weight)/day. Although these assumptions resulted ina worst-case estimation of dietary exposure they were used in the absenceof actual residue data and sufficient current market data. EPA calculatedan upper bound estimate of total dietary risk of 10^\4\ to 10^\3\ basedon this exposure estimate. Data from market basket surveys available atthe time suggested that actual exposure may have been substantially lower;however, concerns regarding the reliability of these surveys preventedEPA from using them as a basis to calculate dietary risk.The use of captan on seeds had previously been considered a non-food useand therefore establishment of tolerances was not necessary. EPA has sincedetermined that tolerances are required for seed treatments unless radio-labeledstudies demonstrate that there is no uptake of residues by the plant. AlthoughEPA realized the need for tolerances for seed treatments at the time ofthe PD 2/3, no data were available. EPA assumed that residues would beinsignificant due to the limited amount of pesticide that could be transferredfrom the seed coating to the whole plant. Data were required and are expectedto be submitted by July 6, 1989. For the purposes of this exposure assessment,EPA considers the residues resulting from seed treatment to make an insignificantcontribution to the diet. EPA will review the data when available and modifythis position if necessary. No seed treatments are being canceled by thisFinal Determination due to dietary concerns.Similarly, in the PD 2/3 EPA had no data on residues on corn seed thathad been detreated in accordance with 40 CFR 186.500 (formerly codifiedas 21 CFR 561.65). EPA believed at that time that there are no detectableresidues in cattle and hogs as a result of feeding detreated corn seed.However, residue data required by EPA to support the detreated corn seedtolerance have not been provided and a notice proposing to revoke thistolerance will be issued shortly.A Special Data Call-In Notice issued in April, 1985, required the submissionof a number of studies which could be used by EPA in refining its dietaryexposure assessment for captan. Included were residue reduction data whichmeasured levels of both captan and its major metabolite tetrahydrophthalimide(THPI) on a number of commodities after washing, peeling, and/or cookingto better estimate actual residues consumed. Also requried were crop residuedata for all registered crops and processing studies to determine levelsof captan and THPI as well as feeding studies in poultry to determine levelsin eggs and tissues.EPA used these data as well as other data available to revise its dietaryexposure assessment. The percentage of crop treated has also been takeninto account for this assessment unlike in the assessment presented inthe PD 2/3. As a result, the best data available have been used in estimatingactual dietary exposure to residues of captan and THPI on each individualcommodity. Monitoring data were used whenever possible in determining exposurelevels as these data measure residues at the point closest to purchaseand thus consumption by an individual. Where monitoring data were not availablefor a particular commodity or there were an insufficient number of samplesupon which to base an estimate, data from field tests were used. Finally,in the absence of both monitoring and field tests, tolerance levels wereused (Ref. 16). EPA relied upon feeding studies in order to estimate theresidue levels occurring in meat and milk.As mentioned previously, exposure to residues of captan was estimated tobe 0.1169 mg/kg (body weight)/day in the PD \2/3\. EPA, in light of thenew data and information, now estimates total exposure to be 0.001606 mg/kg/dayusing EPA's Tolerance Assessment System. Using this exposure estimate,the upper bound lifetime oncogenic risk from dietary exposure to captanranges from 10^6 to 10^5 for the overall U.S. population. The oncogenicrisk is calculated by multiplying exposure by the oncogenic potency factoror Q<T2>1</T2>* [3.6andmultiply;10^3 (mg/kg/day)^1]. The following Table 2 presentsthe upper-bound risks for individual commodities.

For example, EPA uses exposure estimates based on field trial data ratherthan monitoring data to estimate the levels of captan in animal feed items.These data tend to maximize residue levels, as discussed below. EPA alsouses conservative estimates of the percentage of particular feed itemswhich might be present in an animal's diet. The two main feed items whichcan contain captan residues are almond hulls and raisin waste. EPA assumesthat up to 25 percent of an animal's diet may be almond hulls or that upto 10 percent may be raisin waste. The crops which these feed items comefrom are primarily limited to California. Consequently, the current estimateslikely overestimate actual exposure nationwide. EPA also believes that the estimated risk from food commodities is likelyto exceed the total actual risk. As mentioned previously, either the tolerancelevel, field trial data or FDA monitoring data were used in estimatingdietary exposure for a particular food crop. FDA monitoring data are mostrepresentative of the level to which the public is exposed because residuesare measured closest to the point of purchase. However, sufficient FDAmonitoring data were not available for all crops. EPA then relied on fieldtrial data to estimate dietary exposure. These data, used by EPA in establishingtolerances, reflect the maximum registered use conditions of the pesticide(i.e. applications occur at the maximum rate and as close to harvest asthe label permits). Residue levels are measured at the time the crop isharvested. Thus field trial data would overestimate actual dietary exposurebecause (i) residues would have time to degrade from field to market; and(ii) not all growers use the maximum number of applications or the maximumapplication rate. Finally, when neither sufficient FDA monitoring datanor adequate field trial data were available, EPA used the tolerance levelfor the commodity as the level of dietary exposure; a worst-case estimateof exposure. In the PD 2/3, EPA expressed concern regarding the potential for reproductiveeffects from dietary exposure. It was noted that the dietary exposure ofthe average human exceeds by 63 percent the level calculated to be an acceptabledaily intake (now referred to as the Reference Dose (RfD)). However, EPAstated that the final analysis of this risk would depend on residue databeing required of the registrants. Using the exposure estimates derived from the new data submitted sincethe time of the PD 2/3, the anticipated residue contribution representsonly 1.25 percent of the RfD for the overall U.S. population and 4.1 percentfor non-nursing infants which is the sub-population with the greatest exposure.Therefore, the potential for reproductive effects from dietary exposureto captan is no longer believed to present a risk of concern. 1. <T3>Comment:</T3> A number of comments were received regarding the dietaryexposure assessment in the PD 2/3 and Technical Support Document. StaufferChemical Company and Chevron Chemical Company both argued that EPA hadoverestimated dietary exposure by basing exposure estimates on tolerancelevels rather than FDA monitoring data and market basket survey data. <T3>EPA Response:</T3> EPA noted in its PD 2/3 that risks were based onworst-case assumptions about dietary exposure and that although marketbasket surveys suggest exposure, and thus risk, may be substantially lower,definitive data were lacking to predict those lower risks. However, manydata have been submitted since then which have allowed for a more refineddietary exposure assessment. 2. <T3>Comment:</T3> Stauffer and Chevron also stated that sufficient THPIdata were available from which to extrapolate estimates. <T3>EPA Response:</T3> EPA did not estimate THPI levels for the PD 2/3because the ratios of captan levels to THPI levels in the data availablewere sufficiently different that EPA was unsure what ratio to use. Sincethat time, the Agency has requested and received actual data on residuelevels of both captan and THPI in a number of raw and processed agriculturalcommodities. The new data indicate that THPI is an insignificant portionof the residue on raw agricultural commodities. Therefore, EPA no longerbelieves it necessary to estimate residues of THPI for raw agriculturalcommodities. THPI is included in the residue estimates for animal commodities.3. <T3>Comment:</T3> The Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. (NRDC) commentedthat the captan metabolite THPI was inadequately discussed in the PD 2/3.The NRDC also expressed interest in whether EPA would attempt to determinethe conversion of captan to THPI that could occur through such processesas cooking or commercial food processing. <T3>EPA Response:</T3> EPA agrees that the PD 2/3 did not adequately discussTHPI for the reason given in response to the previous comment. As previouslynoted, the Special Data Call-In Notice required a number of studies inorder to determine the levels of captan and THPI in a variety of raw agriculturalcommodities, and in the same commodities following the washing, peeling,and processing steps. These data show that, while negligible amounts ofTHPI are present in the raw agricultural commodities, as the processingsteps proceed captan is almost completely converted to THPI. The levels of captan present on the raw agricultural commodities are nowbeing used in our exposure assessment because they represent the upper-boundsof consumer exposure. With the exception of raisins, in all cases wheredata on processed commodities were available, total residues (captan plusTHPI) on the items processed for human consumption were lower than captanresidues on the raw agricultural commodity. (Residues are lost to washingwater, peeling, cooking water, etc.) 4. <T3>Comment:</T3> NRDC also expressed concern regarding the adequacy ofFDA's routine multi-residue analysis to detect the presence of captan.<T3>EPA Response: </T3>EPA has used FDA monitoring whenever possible toestimate exposure. Samples collected by FDA were analyzed with a reportedrecovery of 80 percent for captan. The estimated limit of detection is0.02 ppm. Consequently, EPA believes these data adequately characterizeexposure to captan. While it is true that the multi-residue analyticalmethod used by the FDA in monitoring activities detects captan but notits major metabolite THPI, this is not considered a problem because virtuallyall of the residue on raw agricultural products is the parent compound.5. <T3>Comment: </T3>The Scientific Advisory Panel was requested to commenton EPA's ``worst-case'' calculation of dietary risk in the PD 2/3 and whetherand to what degree EPA should use FDA's Market Basket Survey data. TheSAP disagreed with the method of estimating human dietary exposure to captan.Particularly, the Panel objected to the use of tolerances, especially whenFDA's Market Basket Survey data were available. It was suggested that theSurvey data be used to the maximum extent possible or use alternative methodsfor making estimates more realistic. <T3>EPA Response: </T3>EPA did not believe that FDA's Market Basket Surveydata were appropriate in estimating captan exposure due to an inadequatenumber of samples. However, since the time of the PD 2/3, EPA has obtainedFDA surveillance monitoring data, which encompasses a much greater numberof samples of commodities than the Market Basket Survey, as well as dataprovided by the registrants, as discussed previously. Where the FDA monitoringdata were considered sufficient (e.g., at least 100 samples with positivedetections for frequently sampled crops), EPA used these data to determineexposure levels because they are believed to be the best available dataand result in a more reliable dietary exposure estimate (Ref. 16). FDAsurveillance monitoring samples are not randomly chosen, but are selectedpartly on the basis of volume of production of a commodity, and also onthe basis of prior residue problems with a particular food. Thus, residuesdetected in the surveillance samples probably are somewhat higher thanin randomly selected samples and provide a more conservative estimate ofrisk. Samples are collected as close as possible to the point of productionin the food chain, because the aim is to monitor fresh food being shippedin interstate commerce. This also would lead to a more conservative exposureestimate than exists when the product finally reaches the consumer. Inaddition, a very large number of samples from many different areas areanalyzed in the surveillance program, many times more than in field trialsor in FDA's Market Basket Survey. For example, 697 samples of strawberrieswere analyzed in 1985-1987 with 270 positive findings reported in 18 statesnationwide. EPA believes that it has used the best data available in estimatingexposure to captan and thus has satisfied the concerns expressed by theSAP. A more detailed discussion of the data used to estimate residues foreach crop, the basis for selecting those data, and the impact the respectivedata set had on the calculations of dietary risk from all food uses ofcaptan is presented in the Office of Pesticide Policy's Dietary ExposureBranch memorandum (Ref. 16). B. Non-Dietary Exposure and Risk 1. <T3>Initiation of Captan Special Review (RPAR). </T3>One of the EPA's concernsin initiating a Special Review of captan was the potential oncogenic riskfrom non-dietary exposure to technical captan and to products containingthis fungicide (45 FR 54938). At that time, no information was availableon the exposure potential from non-agricultural uses of captan or exposureto home uses. EPA reviewed two studies that gave estimates of exposureto captan for mixer/loaders and applicators in orchards using airblastspeed sprayers (Ref. 36) and hand held equipment (Ref. 17). EPA also expressedconcern regarding the potential hazards of exposure to harvesters throughreentry into fields of crops treated with captan before residues on stoneand pome fruits, almonds and vegetable crops had dissipated (Ref. 17).2. <T3>Proposed Decision (PD 2/3). </T3>In preparing its proposed decisionon captan in 1985, EPA reviewed data submitted by registrants on non-dietaryexposure to captan and products cantaining captan. These data were supplementedby studies in the published scientific literature and EPA's own surrogatedata bank. In calculating exposure to captan EPA used a dermal absorptionrate of 1.3 percent per hour. This rate was based on a study in the ratesubmitted by a registrant (Ref. 42) and reviewed by EPA (Ref. 61). EPAassumed 100 percent as the inhalation absorption rate (Ref. 29). Exposure to captan was estimated by calculating the Lifetime Average DailyDose (LADD) using the following formula: LADD = (Dose acquired in 1 workingday in mg/kg/day) andmultiply; (Number of days exposed per year/365) andmultiply;(35 years of working/70 years lifetime). EPA quantified the oncogenic risksfor various agricultural and non-agricultural uses of captan by multiplyingthe Ladd by the hazard potency (Q<T2>1</T2>*) for technical captan of 2.3 andmultiply; 10^\3\ (mg/kg/day)^\1\.3. <T3>Registration Standard and amendments. </T3>EPA's PD 2/3 on captan proposedthat certain protective measures and precautionary statements be requiredwhich would reduce exposure to captan to minimize the risks to workersand home users. Since EPA proposed cancellation of all food uses of captan,the protective measures were specified only for non-food uses. However,in order to protect all users while captan was in Special Review, thesemeasures were specified for both food and non-food uses in the Captan RegistrationStandard issued in March, 1986 and in subsequent amendments in April 1986and April 1987. These measures included the use of chemical resistant glovesby mixer/loaders, field workers, harvesters and home users. In addition,reentry to treated fields was not allowed within 4 days following applicationunless a coverall or long-sleeved shirt and long pants are worn. The new protective measures specified in the Registration Standard wereto be included on the labels on all products containing captan releasedfor shipment after March 6, 1988. EPA considered and granted a requestsubmitted by the Captan Task Force on June 10, 1987 to extend the datelinefor relabeling existing stocks of captan pesticide products in the channelsof trade by 1 year. All registrants were notified that the specified changesshould appear on all labels by March 6, 1989. C. Final Determination on Non-Dietary Exposure and RisksAs part of the Special Review process, EPA has reevaluated the exposureestimates used in calculating the risks from non-dietary exposure to captan.Information from a larger surrogate data base, developed since the PD 2/3on captan was issued in June, 1985, and information received in responseto the captan PD 2/3 have been used in this exposure analysis. The estimated potency or Q<T2>1</T2>* for captan has been revised since the captan PD 2/3 was issued.The new Q<T2>1</T2>* is 3.6 x 10^3 (mg/kg/day)^1 and is discussed in Unit II ofthis Notice. The difference in estimated potency is not sufficient to changethe risk estimates for non-dietary exposure to captan presented in thePD 2/3.Some of the comments submitted in response to EPA's PD 2/3 on captan includedinformation or opinions regarding the accuracy of EPA's non-dietary exposureestimates and the risk assessment based on those exposure estimates. Thesecomments and EPA's responses are summarized below in the appropriate section.Unit III.C.1. concerns agricultural uses of captan including home useson plants and trees. Unit III.C.2. addresses exposure and risks from non-agriculturaluses including use of pet products containing captan. Unit III.C.3. presentscomments and EPA's responses on other issues including the use of surrogatedata. In Unit III.C.4., EPA's assessment of non-dietary exposure and riskfrom captan are summarized. 1. <T3>Comments and EPA response regarding exposure and risk from agriculturaluses of captan.</T3> EPA calculated the risks to agricultural applicators,mixer/loaders and field workers. The lifetime oncogenic risk to applicatorsranged from to 10^5. Mixer/loader risk estimates ranged from 10^6 to 10^5except for treatment of citrus which ranged from 10^7 to 10^6. The riskestimates for field workers were calculated using exposure data on strawberries(Ref. 1). In three studies performed in California, risks from exposureto strawberry pickers were estimated at 10^5. One of these studies alsoestimated the risk for weeders at 10^5. Later studies, also in California,showed the risk from exposure to pickers as 10^5 to 10^4 (Ref. 62) and10^5 (Ref. 38). A study of strawberry pickers in Oregon showed the riskfrom exposure to captan as 10^6 (Ref. 60). a. <T3>Body weight estimates.</T3> A registrant, Stauffer, questioned theapparent inconsistency of assuming that agricultural workers weigh 70 kgwhile assuming that non-agricultural users weigh only 60 kg. <T3>EPA response: </T3>This is not an inconsistency. EPA assumes that theagricultural worker is an adult male with an average standard weight of70 kg. The average non-agricultural user of captan products is assumedto be either an adult male, adult female, or non-adult. The average weightfor these individuals is assumed to be 60 kg. b. <T3>Exposure and risk estimates for mixer/loaders and applicators.</T3>i. Stauffer commented that inconsistencies in calculation methods haveled to erroneous estimates of upper bound risks to mixer/loaders and applicators.For example, they believe that exposure estimates are 10 to 15 times toohigh for air-blast applications. <T3>EPA response:</T3> (a) <T3>Mixer/loaders. </T3>In estimating mixer/loader exposure to captan EPAassumed mixer/loaders wearing no gloves or protective clothing would receivean exposure of 180 mg/hr. This assumption was based on a study conductedby a registrant using captan. EPA has reviewed a surrogate study that,under similar use conditions, predicted an exposure of 47 mg/hr at a 1.0lb a.i./acre application rate (Ref. 31). At the 2.0 lbs a.i./acre captanrate used in the PD 2/3, the Maitlen estimate would be 94 mg/hr. The twofold difference between the Maitlen based estimate of 94 mg/hr and theestimate of 180 mg/hr used in the PD 2/3 is minimal and within the rangeof variability observed with exposure studies. EPA finds these estimatesappropriate for fruit crops (foliage and preharvest uses), vegetable cropsand ornamentals. The mixer/loader exposure expressed as mg/hr would beexpected to be the same for any open pour function where the applicationrates are the same. (b) <T3>Mixer/loader_Nut crops (Almonds). </T3>In calculating exposure to mixer/loadersof captan used on nut crops, EPA relied on an exposure study (Ref. 12)which estimated exposure to mixer/loaders handling benomyl wettable powder.EPA still supports this estimate of 1.1 mg/lb (a.i.). (c) <T3>Airblast applicators. </T3>The airblast applicator exposure was estimatedfor the PD 2/3 using the linear regression equation y = 4.8 x + 16 where``y'' is exposure in mg/hr and ``x'' is the application rate. This regressionequation is still used by EPA and has been determined to accurately predictexposure at the application rates between 1.0 and 7.0 lbs (a.i)/acre usedin the studies whose data comprise the regression equation.(d) <T3>Ground boom applicators. </T3>In the PD 2/3, ground boom applicatorexposure was estimated to be 24 mg/hr based on surrogate studies in whichthe application rates ranged from 0.23 to 3.2 lbs a.i./acre. The currentgeneric data base used by EPA would use an exposure estimate of 9.2 to18 mg/hr for the mean based on the application rates of 2 to 4 lbs a.i./acreused in the PD 2/3. There is no meaningful difference between the estimateof 24 mg/hr used in the PD 2/3 and the 9.2 to 18 mg/hr exposure rate estimatedfrom the current data base especially when considering the two orders ofmagnitude variation in exposure observed with ground boom application.Great variability in exposure is expected due to differences in equipmentused, weather conditions, and personal work habits that occur both betweenapplications and applicators.(e) <T3>Pilot exposure. </T3>In the PD 2/3, pilot exposure was estimated tobe 2.3 mg/hr based on application rates of 2.5 to 6.0 lbs a.i./acre (Ref.26). Using its current generic data base EPA estimated pilot exposure tobe 0.58 mg/hr at an application rate of 1.0 lb a.i./acre.At the higher application rates of 2.5 to 6.0 lbs a.i./acre used in theearlier study, the estimated exposure would be 1.5 to 3.5 mg/hr. This figureencompasses the estimate used in the PD 2/3 which is still supported byEPA. EPA also supports its previous estimate that the risk to pilots applyingcaptan to almonds is 10^7.  ii. A registrant, Chevron Chemical Company, while agreeing with EPA's positionthat it is prudent for those mixer/loaders in contact with captan to weara dust mask and gloves, commented that inhalation exposure during applicationof captan is 100 times less than that during mixing and loading. They statedthat EPA's suggested requirement that a dust mask be worn during applicationwould not significantly reduce exposure particularly since captan in notapplied as a dust. <T3>EPA response: </T3>Since the PD 2/3 was issued in June, 1985, EPA hasmodified the protective clothing requirements for persons exposed to captan.Dust masks were not specified in the Registration Standard since inhalationexposure is negligible compared to dermal exposure. EPA still recommends,in accordance with good industry practices, the use of dust masks for mixer/loadershandling dusty formulations. All mixer/loaders and applicators should wearcoveralls, goggles or face shield, chemical resistant gloves, and bootsor overshoes. In addition, a chemical resistant apron should be worn duringmixing/loading. A hat or other appropriate head covering should be usedfor overhead application in which spray is expected to fall down towardthe head. Chevron also disagreed with EPA's assessment that mixer/loaders and thosewho apply captan to cranberries face an inhalation hazard that is not typicalof other crops.<T3>EPA response: </T3>Tables 10 and 11 in the PD 2/3 on captan show thedermal and inhalation exposure estimates used in calculating risks to mixer/loadersand applicators respectively. The inhalation exposure estimates for cranberriesare the same as those for almost all fruits. EPA acknowledges that theuse of cranberries alone as an example of a site involving both dermaland inhalation exposure to captan was confusing (PD 2/3 II-94).  iii. The University of Hawaii at Manoa submitted comments on the use ofcaptan on wetland taro. They noted that worker exposure, if of concern,would only be relevant to the actual applicator, and could be minimized,if necessary, by revised directions for use. They stated that since theapplication of captan in made only once per growth cycle, which is 12 to15 months from planting to harvest, with the application being a directsoil application with incorporation, and since the average taro farm is2.38 acres with a State total of 370 acres (1983), even applicator exposureposes minimum risk.  <T3>EPA response: </T3>EPA agrees that workers applying captan to tarohave comparatively little exposure to captan compared, for example, toapplicators making foliar applications to other crops. However, althoughonly a low level of exposure is involved in this captan use, EPA believesthat all applicators should use chemical resistant gloves and coveralls,as specified in the Registration Standard, since they provide an importantminimal level of protection for all applicators for agricultural uses ofcaptan. c. <T3>Field worker and harvester exposure and risk estimates. </T3>i. TheCalifornia Almond Growers Exchange and Chevron Chemical Company noted thatalmond culture is highly mechanized and that workers have little contactwith foliage or the crop. <T3>EPA response: </T3>EPA acknowledges that almond culture is highly mechanizedand that workers have little contact with foliage or the crop. However,in the absence of adequate exposure data, EPA still supports its initialestimate of exposure during the procedures involved. ii. The California Prune Raisin and Walnut Research organization and ChevonChemical Company commented that the fieldworker exposure estimates forstrawberries are not applicable to prunes and raisins since applicationsoccur several months prior to harvest, and that potential exposure duringapplication can be reduced to acceptable levels with protective glovesand face masks. <T3>EPA response: </T3>EPA agrees that the strawberry data are not applicableto prunes and raisins and will reevaluate fieldworker exposure to prunesand raisins when new data on tree fruit crops and grapes have been receivedand reviewed. iii. The Florida Strawberry Growers Association commented that the useof water resistant gloves during harvest is impractical as they would causedamage to the fruit. They also suggested that irrigation prior to harvestwould eliminate crop residues. <T3>EPA response: </T3>EPA has reviewed a study conducted by the CaliforniaDepartment of Food and Agriculture on the use of captan on strawberries.This study found that all of the women (but less than 5 percent of men)normally wear chemical resistant gloves to protect their hands from dirtand strawberry juice. Unless Florida varieties vary so significantly fromCalifornia varieties of strawberries, EPA does not believe that gloveswill be any less practical in Florida than has been demonstrated by femaleharvesters in California. In regard to the suggestion that irrigation priorto harvest would reduce exposure to harvesters, EPA has no evidence, andno data have been received from registrants, to show that irrigation reducescaptan residues and removes the need for protective gloves.iv. A registrant, Chevron, commented that EPA has seriously overestimatedexposure to fieldworkers. They questioned the validity of EPA's use ofmonitoring data from field workers who were wearing cotton gloves to pickstrawberries treated with captan. They referenced a study which showedthat exposures obtained by using cotton gloves were approximately fivetimes larger than those obtained by using hand rinses.<T3>EPA response: </T3>While it is true that cotton gloves may overestimatehand exposure in some field studies, it is also possible that they mayunderestimate exposure in others, depending upon how long gloves are wornduring the monitoring period, type of work activity, type of formulatedproduct, chemical, etc. It has not been demonstrated for captan that cottongloves overestimate or underestimate exposure as compared to hand rinses,which are generally believed to underestimate exposure, nor has it beendemonstrated for either methodology that they accurately simulate the retentiveproperties of human skin. The pros and cons of hand exposure passive dosimetryare discussed in depth in Subdivision U of EPA's Applicator Exposure MonitoringGuidelines (Refs. 30 and 59). v. Chevron also stated that they found it neither scientifically nor statisticallyvalid to extrapolate data from strawberry weeders to all fieldworker exposures.They found the study on weeders unsound, noting that the data on exposurewas gathered using four children ages 8-13 and that the range of exposuresfor the four subjects was extreme: from 3.91 mg/hr to 266.72 mg/hr. <T3>EPA response: </T3>EPA agrees that it is not valid to extrapolate fieldworkerexposure from strawberries to other crops. EPA will reevaluate fieldworkerexposure once the additional data are received. d. <T3>Seed Treatments. </T3>The National Cotton Council commented that captanis applied to cotton almost exclusively by commercial seed treating companies.They expressed the view that protective gloves should be required for thosehandling seed, and not for harvesters or field workers. <T3>EPA response: </T3>EPA agrees that chemical resistant gloves shouldbe worn by workers involved in handling treated seed (commercial/bulk manualmixing of captan during seed treatment and hopper filling). Reentry intervalsand protective clothing requirements would not be imposed for cotton fieldworkers or harvesters when captan is only used as a preplant treatmenton cotton seed because EPA believes there would be very little, if any,residues on the plant. Consequently, exposure would be minimal and a reentryinterval would be unnecessary.e. <T3>Home garden uses. </T3>In regard to the estimates of risk from homeuse of captan, EPA received one comment from Security Lawn and Garden Productsthat EPA has overestimated exposure to the home user when captan is usedfor spraying trees. In their estimate, it takes only 45 minutes per 6 treesusing a hose-end applicator to mix, apply, and clean up. <T3>EPA response: </T3>EPA estimate was that the home user would be exposedfor 1.25 hours. EPA finds that even if the lower estimate suggested bySecurity Lawn and Garden were used, it does not make an appreciable differenceto the risk from this use of captan. The estimated risk using the higherexposure estimate is 10^7.2. <T3>Comments and Agency response regarding the non-agricultural uses ofcaptan. </T3>The risks for non-agricultural uses of captan were describedin detail in the PD 2/3. These risks ranged from 10^4 to negligible. Forexample, the estimated risks from exposure to animal shampoos containingcaptan ranged from 10^5 to 10^4. Risks for workers incorporating captaninto plastics, paints and cosmetics were estimated as negligible, and as10^5 for adhesives. EPA calculated that exposure to workers cutting andpackaging cut flowers treated with captan results in risks of 10^7 to 10^6.These risks from non-dietary exposure to captan are described in detailin the Captan PD 2/3. All risks were calculated at the 95 percent confidencelevel and reflect the upper limit of excess cancer risk which is not likelyto be exceeded. Some estimates of exposure and risk from non-agricultural uses of captanhave been evaluated in light of additional data and comments received inresponse to EPA's PD 2/3 on captan. These data and comments are summarizedbelow with EPA's response. a. <T3>Adhesives. </T3>Stauffer questioned the accuracy of EPA's exposureassessment for adhesives believing them to be exaggerated. <T3>EPA response: </T3>The risk estimate for mixer/loader/applicators ofcaptan to adhesives was estimated in the PD 2/3 to be 10^5. However, EPAhas since considered that because captan is added to the adhesives viaa feeding system and that common industry practice is such that there isvery little human exposure during this process. In light of this additionalinformation the estimate of risk to these workers has been reduced to ``negligible.''b. <T3>Non-agricultural home uses. </T3>i. Stauffer questioned the consistencyof EPA's assumption that all of the captan available in shampoos and petpowders is 100 percent absorbed. Stauffer estimated that the absorptionrate for powders would be less than 100 percent. <T3>EPA response: </T3>The use of a 100 percent dermal absorption ratein the PD 2/3 calculations for both pet shampoos and pet powders was inconsistent.Absorption from shampoos is calculated at 100 percent because of the solventsand emollients in the shampoo. The estimated risk from exposure to petshampoos containing captan (without chemical resistant gloves) remainsat 10^5 to 10^4. Dermal absorption for pet powders has been recalculatedat 1.3 percent which reduces the risk from exposure to pet powders from10^8 to 10^10.EPA's estimate of exposure to captan in pet shampoos remains at 100 percentbecause exposure is to an oil/water emulsion, with glycerine, or triethanolaminestearic acid soap. EPA's estimate of risk from exposure to captan in petshampoo is 10^5 to 10^4 without gloves. The use of chemical resistant glovesspecified in the Registration Standard, and subsequent amendments, wouldreduce the estimated risk from captan in pet shampoos to 10^6 to 10^5.The registrant for the remaining registration for pet shampoo containingcaptan requested a voluntary cancellation of this product in January, 1988.ii. A comment was received from the Natural Resources Defense Council andCalifornia Rural Legal Assistance Foundation (NRDC/CRLAF) in response tothe PD 2/3 regarding cosmetics. NRDC/CRLAF expressed the view that EPAhad not demonstrated sufficient concern regarding the potential risk posedby the use of captan in these products; that EPA had not informed the Foodand Drug Administration (FDA) of the risk in a timely manner; and thatEPA had not requested that the FDA notify consumers of all cosmetic productscontaining captan. <T3>EPA response:</T3> EPA agrees that it is important that EPA shouldrelease information to other agencies in a timely manner when risk dataon ingredients which are also regulated by other agencies becomes available.EPA did forward to FDA the information available regarding the risk fromexposure to captan in cosmetics, even though EPA did not have sufficientdata to warrant a recommendation to the FDA that the public be notifiedimmediately of the potential risk posed by captan. Since the PD 2/3 was issued, the FDA has continued to evaluate the potentialrisk from exposure to captan which is used as a bacteriostat in cosmeticsand as an active ingredient in medicated shampoos. A recent report preparedfor FDA by the Expert Panel of the Cosmetic Ingredient Review concludedthat the available data are insufficient for the FDA to determine whethercaptan, under each relevant condition of cosmetic use, is either safe ornot safe and recommended that the FDA undertake the collection of additionaldata on the potential for skin carcinogenicity (Ref. 11). 3. <T3>Other comments and EPA's response on the preliminary determinationon non-dietary exposure and risk</T3>_a.<T3> Teratogenic and reproductive effects.</T3> NRDC/CRLAF expressed theirconcern that the teratogenic and reproductive toxicity for workers wasneither discussed nor calculated in the PD 2/3. They expressed their concernthat workers are more likely to be at teratogenic risk than consumers ofcaptan treated food. <T3>EPA response:</T3> EPA has received additional data on the teratogenicand reproductive effects of captan and these effects are no longer consideredto be at a level of concern. These issues are discussed in Unit II of thisNotice. b. <T3>Use of surrogate data.</T3> The NRDC/CRLAF commented that for severaluse sites, EPA relied on exposure studies conducted for other chemicalsin determining captan exposure without providing any justification forreliance on this surrogate data. For example, for not crops, an exposurestudy for benomyl was used as a surrogate for exposure to captan. <T3>EPA response:</T3> EPA believes that the use of surrogate data to estimatethe exposure to individuals handling a pesticide has become an acceptedprocedure in the scientific community. As one would expect, a large arrayof variables affect the exposure received by a mixer/loader or applicator.The factors that impart the greatest impact to which the data can be normalizedare formulation type, application rate, acreage treated, clothing and equipmentused. Other factors that have an impact on exposure, for which standardizationof variation is difficult, are environmental conditions and personal workhabits. Chemical specificity is very important in determining dosage, whichdepends on the ability of the specific pesticide and formulation to penetratethe skin. EPA's Pesticide Assessment Guidelines, Subdivision U, discussesthe issue of surrogate data in more detail. Current Agency policy is touse appropriate surrogate data in estimating exposure when adequate chemicalspecific data are not available; when chemical specific data become available,they are incorporated into the data base. A large data base is more importantin that it assists EPA in estimating the wide range of possible exposuresbelieved likely to occur for a pesticide during its use on any given usesite. c.<T3> Use of protective clothing.</T3> The NRDC/CRLAF expressed concernthat EPA consistently estimates that protective clothing and rubber gloveswill reduce exposure to pesticides by about 80 percent. They stated thatthe assumption was made throughout the PD 2/3 that there would be a reductionin dermal exposure to captan resulting from the use of protective clothingbut that this assumption was not documented. They asked if any captan exposurestudies had been conducted to support these percentage reductions and challengedthe validity of these estimates in the absence of chemical-specific data.<T3>EPA response:</T3> EPA's Applicator Exposure Monitoring Guidelines,Subdivision U (NTIS Document No. PB87-133286), discusses estimating theprotective value of clothing. There is not sufficient data available toidentify a single statistically valid value for clothing penetration. InEPA's surrogate data base, there is a clustering of values in the 5 to10 percent range, which suggests that level may be typical. Thus, for achronic exposure, where average exposure is important, a 10 percent penetration(or 90 percent protection) estimate is appropriate. However, in the surrogatedata base, there are sufficient excursions above the 5 to 10 percent levelto demonstrate that, on occasion, exposures are much higher. For an acuteeffect, it is important to consider exposure which could occur on any givenday. Thus, EPA saw the need to create a safety factor above the 10 percentpenetration estimate for acute effects. A 50 percent estimate was chosenbecause it incorporates an ample safety factor over the 5 to 10 percentestimate and includes many of the outlying excursions representing higherpenetrations as well. Because captan's toxicological concern is based onchronic exposure rather than single dose (acute) exposure, the 10 percentpenetration, or 90 percent protection, estimate was used.d.<T3> Home uses of captan.</T3> NRDC/CRLAF were critical of EPA for notstating its position regarding home use of captan. They urged EPA to immediatelysuspend home use of captan given the oncogenic, reproductive, and possibleteratogenic and mutagenic concerns associated with this chemical. Theyexpressed the opinion that although EPA could argue that protective clothingwould substantially reduce the risks from inhalation and dermal exposure,it was unlikely that home gardeners would adhere to such label precautionsor that they would have proper protective clothing available. NRDC alsorequested that subsequent Agency Special Review documents on captan, orany other chemical, contain a distinct section identifying the risks andbenefits of the home uses and the regulatory decisions on such uses.<T3>EPA response:</T3> The oncogenic risks for home uses of captan on plantsand gardens were estimated in the PD 2/3 to be 10^7. This estimate is confirmedby a study in which home user application was measured directly. The exposureestimate assumes that a short-sleeved shirt and long pants are worn; itdoes not assume the use of any protective equipment, including gloves (Ref.27). EPA has recommended the use of protective gloves and that labels ofcaptan products for home use list simple instructions geared towards thehome uses that would result in a further reduction in exposure if theywere followed. EPA agrees with NRDC/CRLAF that position documents on pesticideswhich are labelled for home use should clearly describe the risks and benefitsof these uses.4.<T3> Summary of EPA's assessment of the risks from non-dietary exposureto captan.</T3> Based on the review of the available data and the commentsreceived in response to the PD 2/3 regarding risks from non-dietary exposureto captan, EPA has determined that the exposure and risk estimates formixer/loaders and applicators have not changed substantially (Table 3).The highest risks remain in the range of 10^6 to 10^5.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table 3_PD 2/3 Risk Estimates (Without Protective Clothing) \1\</T4><H1>Agricultural uses</H1><H1>Mixer/loader</H1><H1>Applicators</H1> Fruit/nut crops: <ITAG tagnum="2">Almonds <D>10</D>^6 to 10^5 <D>10</D>^7 (pilot) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="12">Apples:  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Preharvest </ITAG><D>10</D>^6 <D>10</D>^6 to 10^5 <ITAG tagnum="3">Postharvest </ITAG><D>10</D>^6 <ITAG tagnum="2">Apricots <D>10</D>^6 <D>10</D>^6 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Avocado <D>10</D>^6 <D>10</D>^6 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Blackberry <D>10</D>^6 <D>10</D>^6 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Blueberry <D>10</D>^6 to 10^5 <D>10</D>^6 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="12">Cherries: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Preharvest </ITAG><D>10</D>^6 to 10^5 <D>10</D>^6 to 10^5 <ITAG tagnum="2">Citrus <D>10</D>^7 to 10^6 <D>10</D>^7 to 10^6 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Cranberry <D>10</D>^6 <D>10</D>^6 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Grapes <D>10</D>^6 <D>10</D>^6 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Mangos <D>10</D>^6 to 10^5 <D>10</D>^6 to 10^5 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Nectarines <D>10</D>^6 <D>10</D>^6 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Peaches <D>10</D>^6 <D>10</D>^6 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Pears <D>10</D>^6 <D>10</D>^7 to 10^6 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Plums <D>10</D>^6 <D>10</D>^6 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Pineapple <D>10</D>^6 <D>10</D>^6 to 10^5 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Strawberry <D>10</D>^6 <D> </D></ITAG>Vegetable crops: <ITAG tagnum="2">Beans <D>10</D>^6 <D>10</D>^6 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Beets <D>10</D>^6 <D>10</D>^6 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Carrots <D>10</D>^6 <D>10</D>^6 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Celery <D>10</D>^6 to 10^5 <D>10</D>^6 to 10^5 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Cucurbits <D>10</D>^6 to 10^5 <D>10</D>^6 to 10^5 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Eggplant <D>10</D>^6 to 10^5 <D>10</D>^6 to 10^5 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Lettuce <D>10</D>^6 <D>10</D>^6 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Peppers <D>10</D>^6 to 10^5 <D>10</D>^6 to 10^5 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="12">Potatoes:  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Foliar </ITAG><D>10</D>^6 to 10^5 <D>10</D>^6 to 10^5 <ITAG tagnum="3">Seed treatment </ITAG><D>10</D>^7 to 10^6<D>10</D>^7 <ITAG tagnum="2">Rhubarb <D>10</D>^6 to 10^5 <D>10</D>^7 to 10^6 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="12">Soybeans: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Seed treatment </ITAG><D>10</D>^7 to ^6<D>10</D>^7 to 10^6 <ITAG tagnum="2">Spinach <D>10</D>^6 <D>10</D>^6 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Sweetcorn <D>10</D>^6 to 10^5 <D>10</D>^6 to 10^5 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Taro <D> </D><D> </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Tomatoes </ITAG><D>10</D>^6 to 10^5 <D>10</D>^6 to 10^5 <F>\1\ These risk estimates are summarized from the exposure and risk estimatespresented and discussed in Unit II. of the PD 2/3.

The estimate of risk for applicators from exposure to captan incorporatedin adhesives has been reduced from 10^5 to ``negligible''. The home user'srisk from exposure to captan in products used on plants and gardens isl0^7. EPA has not changed its earlier estimates of fieldworker/ harvester risksfrom non-dietary exposure to captan. Risks were calculated to be at 10^5.Additional data on fieldworker/ harvester exposure have recently been submittedto EPA as part of the data required by the Registration Standard. Whenthese data submissions have been completed and reviewed EPA will reevaluatethe risks to fieldworkers/harvesters from exposure to captan and establishappropriate reentry periods. In EPA's PD 2/3 on captan, EPA proposed certain protective clothing requirementswhich it was anticipated would reduce the non-dietary exposure to captanfor mixer/loaders, applicators, fieldworkers, and home users. For agriculturaluses of captan, a reentry interval of four days was specified replacingthe former requirement that workers must not enter captan treated fieldsuntil after sprays had dried. These measures were also specified in theCaptan Registration Standard and subsequent amendments and included labellingchanges reflecting EPA's policies regarding protective clothing and otherprecautionary measures. Unit VI of this Notice states EPA's conclusionsregarding the worker risks from the use of captan. <ITAG tagnum="85">IV. Summary of Benefits Assessment and Agency Evaluation of Commentsand Additional Data Received</ITAG>In its PD 2/3, EPA presented an analysis of the benefits associated withthe continued use of the fungicide captan, and presented a crop by cropevaluation of the benefit considerations in an accompanying Technical SupportDocument. The benefits of captan were assessed in terms of the economicimpacts which would result for producers and consumers if the chemicalwere no longer available due to cancellation. The main factors consideredin the impact analysis were changes in production costs and crop yields.An assessment of the effects of cancelling captan provides a baseline estimateof the value of captan products to the agricultural community and society,and illustrates the effects that would follow if captan users had to switchto alternative fungicides. In issuing the PD 2/3 EPA expressed its concern not only with risks fromthe use of captan but with the risks associated with fungicides as a group.EPA was aware that the proposed cancellation of the food uses of captanmight result in growers shifting to alternative chemicals that also hadtoxicological concerns. While proposing to examine each of the alternativefungicides through the Registration Standard or Special Review process,EPA encouraged registrants to generate data on safer and less toxic chemicalsand alternative methods of controlling fungi. EPA's current assessmentof the likely shifts in usage for various cancellation scenarios involvingcaptan, chlorothalonil and the EBDCs is discussed in Unit VI of this Notice.The importance EPA has placed on considering the fungicides as a groupis also based on its concern that estimates of the benefits of any onefungicide need to take into consideration the problem of resistance. Researchon the efficacy of various fungicides shows that resistant strains of fungimay develop when only one, or in some cases when a limited number of differentfungicides is used. If resistance develops and no alternatives are available,major economic losses could occur if control of the pest or pathogen isessential to crop production. It is difficult to predict if and when resistancewill develop for every use site due to variability in fungal populations,climatic variations in different regions, and variations in the combinationof fungicides used by different growers. Resistance is more likely to developwhen there is heavy disease pressure over an extended portion of the growingseason. EPA has taken this problem of resistance into consideration inits benefits analysis for each of the registered uses of captan. In the PD 2/3 and the Technical Support Document for captan, EPA estimatedthat the proposed cancellation of captan on all food crops would resultin total first year losses to farmers of $20 to $44 million (includingseed treatments), which represents the increased costs of using, in somecases, more expensive alternative fungicides and the decreased value ofproduction (decreased yields). It was estimated that the burden would beborne largely by the consumer for fruit and vegetables, by the farmer forseed treatments and by the grower for ornamentals. EPA did not proposecancellation of the non-food or nonagricultural uses of captan. Seed treatmentswere considered a food use, but were not proposed for cancellation in thePD 2/3. In response to the PD 2/3 issued in June, 1985, EPA received numerous commentsrelating to its assessment of the benefits of captan and the potentialeconomic impacts of its cancellation. The following registrants submitted preliminary comments including benefitsand usage information to EPA in August, 1985: Chevron Chemical Company,Inc., Stauffer Chemical Company, Inc., and Makhteshim-Agan (America), Inc.A more extensive benefits summary of apples, strawberries, stone fruitsand seed treatments was conducted for the registrants by SRI Internationaland submitted to EPA in March, 1986. In October, I988, the industry's CaptanTask Force, now under the direction of ICI Americas, Inc., submitted adraft of their most recent captan benefit assessment (Ref. 21). This assessmentaddressed the use of captan on the following crops: almonds, apples, apricots,blueberries, caneberries, cantaloupes, cherries, cucumbers, grapes, nectarines,peaches, tomatoes, pears, plums, prunes, strawberries; the post-harvesttreatment of apples, cherries and pears; and a number of seed treatments.The Task Force has submitted the required residue data in support of thecontinued registration of the following food uses of captan: almonds, apples,apricots, cantaloupe, cherries, cucumbers, grapes, nectarines, peaches,pears, plums/prunes, strawberries and tomatoes. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) submitted comments in responseto EPA's Preliminary Determination on captan. The USDA is conducting anin depth assessment of all chemical fungicides, including captan. Theybelieve that there are significant benefits to having captan availablefor some minor uses which registrants have not supported, and may undertaketo gather data for some of these uses. It is anticipated that the resultsof their fungicide assessment will become available in 1990. The USDA commentsappear in their entirety in Unit V of this document. Comments on the benefits of captan were also received from 9 individualgrowers or processors, from 12 grower associations, and from CooperativeExtension Services or university research facilities in California, Georgia,Louisiana, Ohio and Washington. Many responses stressed the established record of effective captan useincluding low cost, relative ease of use and low phytotoxicity. It wasalso emphasized that captan is effective against a broader spectrum ofdiseases than many of its alternatives. Many rebuttals to EPA's proposedcancellation of the food uses of captan expressed the opinion that itsremoval from the marketplace would have a detrimental effect on the productionof fruit crops and almonds, and on the post-harvest treatment of tree fruits.It should be noted that very few of the rebuttals included any new fielddata, technical literature, or experimental data to substantiate the variousbenefits statements submitted. A. Food Uses of Captan As a result of concerns raised by commenters and the additional data thathave become available, EPA has revised its estimates of the economic impactsrelating to the use of captan on a number of food crops. For example, EPAnow estimates that if captan were not available as a post-harvest treatmenton cherries or pears, annual losses would amount to $4.6 and $16.3 millionrespectively. In the PD 2/3, the total estimated benefits for the registered food usesof captan (excluding seed treatments) were between $11.3 and $23.7 millionper year. EPA agrees with Extension Service and state recommendations thaton some crops there are no viable alternatives to captan when certain diseasesare present and also finds that captan is important in slowing the developmentof resistance to its alternatives. These are important although unquantifiedbenefits of having captan available. EPA now estimates the quantifiableeconomic benefits of having captan available for the food uses of captan(excluding seed treatments) to be at least between $67.8 and $75.1 milliondollars annually. The following sections give EPA's estimate of the likely impacts that wouldresult from the loss of captan's availability for disease control on eachof the crops for which it is currently registered. 1. <T3>Almonds. </T3>In EPA's preliminary determination on the benefits ofretaining the use of captan on almonds, it was estimated that captan wasused on about 188,000 acres of almonds, representing about 59 percent ofU.S. almond acreage with annual benefits of about $1.4 million. Commentsfrom the Almond Board of California in 1985 indicated that EPA's 1979 dataunderestimated the total almond bearing acreage, and that 59 percent ofthe total acreage is 233,000 acres. Information from industry's CaptanTask Force in October, 1988 noted that extension experts estimate thatbetween 75 and 100 percent of all almond acreage is treated with captan.Comments received about the efficacy of captan in treating diseases onalmonds include the California Almond Growers Exchange's assessment thatcaptan is the most useful protectant fungicide for almonds because it iseffective against the four major diseases attacking blossoms, leaves andbuds. Also, in the San Joaquin Valley where most of California's almondproduction occurs, dry conditions make it possible for growers to controlboth brown rot and shot-hole with a single fungicide application. Captan'sbroad spectrum of efficacy makes it particularly useful for this kind ofapplication. Knowledge of the brown rot benomyl resistance on peaches canbe used effectively in directing the use of broad spectrum alternativesto delay similar resistance problems in other crops. Captan would providea valuable alternative to benomyl in the event that almond brown rot becameresistant to this chemical. <T3>Conclusion: </T3>EPA agrees that total almond bearing acreage has increasedsignificantly since 1979 and that captan use has also increased. However,EPA maintains its position that about 60 percent of the almond acreageis treated with captan. Captan's use is important in slowing the developmentof resistance. Some resistance to the alternatives benomyl and iprodionewhich are used in treating brown rot has already been reported. Captanand ziram are the only two products that currently give effective controlof shot-hole which is another major disease on almonds. Captan is preferredto ziram because it also controls brown rot, leaf blight and scab, resultingin fewer applications and reduced treatment costs. EPA agrees that captan is the only registered fungicide which controlsall the major almond diseases and thus does not require two or more fungicidesto cover the entire spectrum of diseases. Its broad spectrum activity alsomakes it the preferred pesticide to be used in combination with benzimidazoles(benomyl and thiophanate-methyl), and with the new sterol biosynthesis-inhibitingfungicides where it is used to prevent or ameliorate resistance build-upin pathogenic fungi. Benefits have increased by at least the 24 percentincrease in acres to about $1.7 million per year. 2. <T3>Apples. </T3>The use of captan is registered both as a pre- and post-harvesttreatment on apples. In the PD 2/3, EPA estimated the loss in net revenuesto farmers if the pre-harvest uses of captan on apples were cancelled.The effect of cancellation of the post-harvest use on apples was not estimated.Average annual per acre losses ranged from approximately $530 in the Northeastto $150 in the Southeast. It was also anticipated that the loss of captanwould result in the diversion of about 40 million pounds of fresh fruitannually to the processed market because of the likely increase in diseasedamage when alternatives to captan were used. EPA's position was that although none of the captan alternatives were registeredfor control of all the apple diseases that can be controlled by captan,there were viable alternative fungicides. Dikar, containing mancozeb anddinocap, was mentioned as one of the most effective alternatives to captan.Others included metiram, captafol and folpet. Two of these alternatives:folpet and captafol, have since been 100 cancelled. Mancozeb and metiram(EBDCs) are currently in Special Review. A plant pathologist with the Cooperative Extension Service at the Universityof Georgia commented that captan has been a major fungicide for controllingfruit disease, particularly on apples, for about 25 years and that fruitgrowers in Georgia would lose millions of dollars if captan were not availableto control the summer rots that affect apples. Comments received from the Cooperative Extension Service, Washington StateUniversity, stressed the importance of the post-harvest treatment of apples.The Captan Task Force also addressed the need for captan in post-harvesttreatment of apple diseases. They estimate that in the Northwest as muchas 50 percent of the apple production (almost 430,000 tons of apples) thatis currently treated with captan would be lost. In Washington State, a 17 percent loss would result in a loss of about$54 million. This estimate is based on the inability of the benzimidazolesand other non-EBDC alternatives to captan to control the same broad spectrumof pathogens. The Captan Task Force predicted similar losses in Wisconsindue to resistant Penicillium blue mold strains which would result in annuallosses estimated at about one-quarter of a million dollars. In New York, an estimated 10 percent of the apple crop would be lost withoutcaptan. Extension experts indicate that packing houses would use a combinationof diphenylamine, which is more expensive than captan, and a benzimidazole.Losses in this state could total $8 million annually. Virginia packing houses are not expected to use diphenylamine as it hasbeen found to cause injury to Golden Delicious apples in field trials.It is estimated that up to 25 percent of the Virginia apple crop wouldbe destroyed without captan due to resistant strains of Botrytis and Penicillium,resulting in an annual loss of almost $5 million. The Captan Task Forcestated that without captan, the total loss to apple producing states wouldbe approximately $72 million per year. The most recent information received from registrants through the CaptanTask Force (October, 1988) includes their estimate that approximately 50percent of all apple acreage is treated with captan which is somewhat higherthan the original Agency estimate of 36 percent. <T3>Conclusion: </T3>Comments received indicate that about 50 percent ofthe apple acreage may be treated with captan; however, data were not submittedto support this claim. Therefore, EPA retains its estimate of the net impactsdue to the loss of captan for pre-harvest uses as discussed in the documentssupporting the PD 2/3. EPA recognizes that particular regions may experiencehigh losses if captan were not available. Although EPA did not estimate the impact of the loss of captan as a post-harvesttreatment in its PD 2/3, EPA agrees with estimates received in commentsthat about 25 percent of the apple crop is treated with captan post-harvest.While EPA has not put a specific dollar estimate on the magnitude of benefitsof post-harvest captan treatments, the loss of captan could result in lossesin excess of $25 million if only 5 percent of the apples in storage werelost due to storage rots. 3. <T3>Apricots. </T3>In its PD 2/3, EPA stated that there was unlikely tobe widespread decreased disease control if captan were not available. Itwas estimated that about 15 percent of apricot acreage is treated and thatthe economic impact of the loss of captan was estimated to range from adecrease in control costs of $434,000 to an increase of $700,000 dependingon the alternative selected. It appeared that the most likely alternativesto captan were thiophanate methyl, triforine, maneb, benomyl, and sulfur.EPA's current estimate is that approximately 60 percent of the apricotcrop in the United States is treated with captan. The recommended alternativesto captan include ziram, maneb, zineb, benomyl, iprodione, triforine, sulfurand thiophanatemethyl. The Captan Task Force summary of the economic impact of captan on thiscrop indicates that ziram is the only alternative and that ziram is bothmore expensive and less effective than captan. As with other crops, thereis concern by growers that more than one chemical should be available sothat the problem of fungal resistance can be minimized. <T3>Conclusion: </T3>Although EPA believes there are other alternativesto captan besides ziram for some diseases, EPA agrees with the Task Forcesummary in reference to the resistance problem. The EBDCs are in SpecialReview and if their use on apricots were cancelled captan would be evenmore important for deterring the build-up of resistance with the newerbiochemically selective fungicides. 4. <T3>Caneberries/blueberries. </T3>In 1985, EPA estimated that captan wasused for disease control on about 26 to 33 percent of caneberries (blackberries,dewberries, and raspberries), blueberries and cranberries. It was believedthat major losses of $3.5 to $4 million would occur for those producersusing captan due to increased treatment costs of $200,000 to $300,000 andproduction losses of $3.3 to $3.7 million. The North American Blueberry Council is gathering residue data in supportof the continued registration of captan on blueberries. In telephone communicationwith EPA, they indicated that captan is used to treat 90 percent of the14,000 acres that are currently in production in Michigan where it is appliedtwo or three times a year. New Jersey has 9,500 acres of blueberries whichare treated with captan twice a year. Captan is used in mixes or alternatedwith sterol inhibitors (e.g. triforine) as an anti-resistance measure.The Council expressed their concern that the loss of captan would havea major impact on producers and consumers of this crop. EPA also received information from the USDA which indicates that blueberryacreage in Illinois, Massachusetts and Washington is also treated withcaptan. The Captan Task Force submitted some information on blueberries which indicatedthat no effective alternatives exist to control most of the diseases onthis crop. Captafol is no longer registered, and resistance to benomylhas made it ineffective for Botrytis control. The Task Force estimatesthat by the second or third year that captan is unavailable, growers wouldlose anywhere between 20 and 40 percent of their fruit revenues. The Captan Task Force commented that approximately 40 percent of all caneberryacreage is treated with captan and that if this fungicide were not availablethe cost of disease protection would increase significantly because ofthe higher cost of the alternatives. The most likely alternative treatmentswould be three applications of an iprodione and benomyl combination followedby one or two applications of benomyl alone. They note that some resistanceto these alternative chemicals has already occurred. Several comments were received from caneberry growers and processors andtheir associations. They indicated that captan is effective against Botrytisand fruit rot to which small fruits are susceptible particularly duringa rainy season and noted that Botrytis has shown no resistance to thisfungicide. A member of the Department of Plant Pathology at Ohio State Universityalso expressed concern about EPA's proposed cancellation of captan. Hedescribed captan as the most commonly used and effective fungicide on smallfruits and that there are not sufficient alternative fungicides to replacethe use of captan in small fruit production.One estimate of the use of captan on dewberries is that 40 percent of thecrop is treated annually. Texas also recommends captan for control of anthracnose,fruit rot and Phomopsis on these small berries. The alternatives are copperhydroxide, or combinations of maneb and zinc or copper sulfate, sulfur,zineb and maneb.<T3>Conclusion:</T3> While it remains difficult to get information on allof the minor berry crops, EPA believes that between 25 and 40 percent ofblueberries and caneberries are treated with captan. While the variouscomments received claim losses for specific problems, none of the responsesreceived aggregate the impacts to provide any information which would indicatethat EPA's initial benefit estimates were incorrect. Therefore, EPA isnot changing its position that annual losses of $3.5 to $4 million willoccur if captan uses were cancelled on these sites.5.<T3> Cantaloupe/Muskmelons.</T3> In the PD 2/3, EPA did not discuss theuse of captan on cantaloupe/muskmelons and had no information availableto indicate that captan was important for disease control on this crop.Since the PD 2/3, industry's Captan Task Force has submitted informationindicating that there is very little use of captan on cantaloupe/muskmelonsand that there are more efficacious alternatives available.<T3>Conclusion:</T3> EPA believes that less than 10 percent of cantaloupe/muskmelonsare treated with captan and that there are adequate and probably more efficaciousalternatives to captan for this crop including triadimefon, benomyl, chlorothalonil,mancozeb, maneb and zineb.6.<T3> Celery.</T3> EPA did not directly address the benefits of captan useon celery in the PD 2/3 but instead addressed vegetables as a group sinceEPA had little data and no indication that captan had important benefitson these crops.Comments received provided conflicting information on the percent of celerywhich is treated with captan. One estimate indicates that 70 percent ofthis crop is treated with captan, while other estimates state that 1 percentor less is treated annually. Florida recommends captan as a plant bed drenchor spray to control damping-off and this appears to be a use for whichfew, if any, alternatives are available. The alternatives for foliar treatmentof celery diseases appear to be adequate and include benomyl, chlorothalonil,coppers, mancozeb, metiram, maneb, thiophanate-methyl, DCNA and thiram.<T3>Conclusion:</T3> EPA concludes that captan is not important as a foliartreatment for celery. However, it agrees that the plantbed treatment forFlorida celery represents an important use in that state and that the lossof this treatment could result in a total loss of the crop when damping-offpresents a problem. EPA estimates that a loss of 10 percent of the cropin Florida would result in losses of about $4.6 million.7.<T3> Cherries.</T3> In the PD 2/3, there was insufficient information availableto estimate the benefits impact of the cancellation of captan uses on cherries;however, EPA had no reason to believe that producers would experience majorlosses.Comments submitted to EPA by the Ortho-Chevron Chemical Company in 1985stated that resistance to alternatives such as thiophanate-methyl had alreadyoccurred on sweet cherries. In addition, the Captan Task Force's l988 assessmentof captan usage on this crop states that although the efficacy and comparativeperformance of alternatives is estimated to be equal to captan, withoutcaptan the costs of disease management would increase significantly. Alternativesinclude: Iprodione, vinclozolin and chlorothalonil for brown rot: Iprodionefor Botrytis; dodine on tart cherries and ferbam on sweet cherries forleaf spot. The Task Force estimates that approximately 80 percent of sweetand 5 to 10 percent of tart cherry acreage is treated with captan annually.Three of the five chemicals listed as alternatives to captan should beused alternately or in combination with captan or another broad spectrumfungicide to inhibit resistance development. The only other broad spectrumfungicide registered on cherries is chlorothalonil.Registrants also regard captan as an important post-harvest treatment onsweet cherries. The Captan Task Force estimates that the total loss ofrevenue on this crop would be almost $16 million if captan were not available.Washington ($7 million) and Oregon ($8 million) would be the most affected.Alternatives to captan include the benzimidazoles. However these alternativesare considered less effective overall because of resistance by certainstrains of Botrytis, Penicillium and Monilinia, and because control ofRhizopus, Alternaria or Mucor is not claimed by other pesticides labeledfor this site. Some packing houses in the Northwest treat harvested cherrieswith a chlorine bath before the fungicide drench. This treatment is onlyregistered to reduce fungus spores and is not as effective as captan againstpost-harvest diseases. In addition, because the fruit must be dried betweenthe two processes, it is a more expensive and time-consuming process.<T3>Conclusion:</T3> EPA believes that about 85 percent of cherries receiveeither pre- or post-harvest treatments with captan. EPA agrees with thecomments received that resistance to some captan alternatives on cherrieshas been demonstrated, and that with some alternatives there are both limitationson the time of application and lessened efficacy. EPA also agrees thatthe benefits of pre-harvest and post-harvest uses of captan are largerthan were initially estimated and now estimates the benefits of captan'spre- and post-harvest uses on this crop to be at least $4.6 million annually.8.<T3> Cranberries.</T3> The PD 2/3 did not address the benefits resultingfrom the use of captan on cranberries specifically, but rather as partof the small berries. Since then, EPA has received information that thereis very little use of captan on this crop: about 1 percent nationwide andup to 5 percent in the western areas of the United States.<T3>Conclusion: </T3>EPA believes that while captan can be beneficial tosome cranberry growers, it is not widely used and is not regarded as importantfor disease control on this crop. 9. <T3>Cucumbers. </T3>Prior to issuing the captan PD 2/3, EPA had no informationavailable on the percent of cucumber acreage treated with captan. Thiscrop was grouped in EPA's estimate of the benefits of captan's use on vegetables,and EPA considered it unlikely that there would be any negative impacton producers or consumers if captan were not available on this site. Information received from the Captan Task Force on cucumbers indicatesthat there is very little post-plant use of captan on this crop. The TaskForce reported that the alternatives to captan: chlorothalonil, maneb andmetalaxyl are more efficacious. <T3>Conclusion: </T3>EPA maintains its position in the PD 2/3 that thereis little use of captan on cucumbers and estimates that less than 1 percentof this crop is treated with captan nationwide. EPA agrees that adequatealternatives to captan are available for both commercial and home use.10. <T3>Eggplant. </T3>The PD 2/3 did not address the use of captan specificallyon eggplant. <T3>Conclusion: </T3>EPA has since evaluated the use of captan on eggplantand has concluded that captan is used for disease control as a plant-bedor flat treatment and for this use there are no alternatives. Alabama,New Jersey, New York and Georgia recommend this use and they (together)account for a substantial portion of the total U.S. eggplant acreage. Thus,the loss of captan would be a major loss to the eggplant growers of thesestates. There is little use of captan as a foliar treatment for which thereare several alternatives including maneb, zineb, fixed coppers and ziram.11. <T3>Grapes. </T3>In the PD 2/3, EPA had limited data available to estimatethe impact of the cancellation of captan on grapes although it was believedunlikely that the loss of captan would have a major impact. The CaptanTask Force claims that the chemical costs to growers would increase significantlyif captan were not available for use on grapes. The Task Force estimates that about 20 percent of California grapes aretreated with captan. Their research shows that the efficacy and comparativeperformance of some of the alternative chemicals generally would be aboutthe same as captan. However, without captan, more than one chemical wouldbe needed to control the five major diseases on muscadine grapes. The CaptanTask Force estimates that between 50 and 80 percent of all muscadine grapeacreage is treated with captan and approximately 10 percent of that acreageis treated eight times each season. There are no alternatives to controleither ripe rot or bitter rot on these grapes, and the only alternativefor Macrophoma rot is benomyl which is only used in combination with captanbecause of the resistance problem. For Botrytis, iprodione and vinclozolinare potential chemical alternatives to captan and Botrytis may also becontrolled by removing the leaves from around clusters. This latter measureis very labor intensive (approximately $200 per acre) and the Task Forcebelieves that it would only be economically viable in premium wine growingareas. <T3>Conclusion: </T3>Since the voluntary cancellation of folpet on foodcrops and the emergency suspension of dinoseb, only captan and mancozebhave full Federal registration for control of Phomopsis cane and leaf spot.Mancozeb is in Special Review with the other EBDC fungicides. Sodium arseniteis registered for use in California but some wineries will not accept grapestreated with this chemical. Sodium arsenite is currently in Special Reviewand the State of California is also reviewing the use of this chemicalunder its Birth Defects Prevention Act. EPA agrees that there are major benefits from using captan on grapes sinceits broad spectrum activity prevents resistance to other fungicides andit protects against diseases for which good alternatives are not available.EPA estimates the benefit of having captan available for use on grapesat $1.2 million per year. 12. <T3>Lettuce. </T3>In the PD 2/3, EPA addressed the likely benefit of havingcaptan available for use on lettuce as part of its assessment of a numberof vegetable and fruit crops. No data were available to make a specificestimate of the importance of captan on lettuce although EPA believed thatthe cancellation of captan on this crop would not have a major economicimpact.The Cooperative Extension Service, University of California commented thatthere are significant benefits to the use of captan on lettuce and hasrecently indicated its willingness to generate residue data to supportcontinued registration of the use. <T3>Conclusion: </T3>EPA now estimates that up to 5 percent of lettuceproduced in the United States is treated with captan. Although captan givesonly fair control on downy mildew, a broad spectrum fungicide is necessaryto use with metalaxyl or benzimidazole fungicides because of the resistanceproblem. The current alternatives to captan include maneb, maneb and metalaxyl,maneb and zinc, zineb, and for seed beds only: coppers and lime. Maneband zineb are in Special Review. The economic impact of the loss of captanis estimated to be $2.2 million. 13. <T3>Mangoes. </T3>The PD 2/3 did not address the use of Captan on mangoes.However, after investigating the benefits of this use, EPA now believesthat captan is of major importance to this minor crop as a broad spectrumfungicide to be mixed or alternated with triadimefon and benomyl. Withoutcaptan there would be a build-up of resistance to these alternatives. Captaneffectively controls Cercospora leaf blotch or spot, post-harvest molds,and storage rots including Botrytis, Gleosporium and Rhizopus. 14. <T3>Onions. </T3>The PD 2/3 addressed vegetable uses as a group, includingthe use of captan on onions. The available data indicated that captan isnot used extensively on onions. Comments received since the PD 2/3 fromthe Cooperative Extension Service at the University of California indicatethat there are significant benefits for the use of captan on green onions.Captan is effective for Botrytis control on green onions and the only alternativeis chlorothalonil.EPA has not received any comments regarding the benefits of captan fordisease control on dry bulb onions. EPA estimates that less than 1 percentof onions (dry bulb and green) produced in the United States are treatedwith captan. Alternatives to captan for disease control on dry bulb onionsinclude a combination of metalaxyl and chlorothalonil, mancozeb, and combinationsof zineb, iprodione and chlorothalonil. <T3>Conclusion: </T3>EPA agrees that there are viable alternatives to captanfor disease control for dry bulb onions but that captan is important forthe production of green onions as chlorothalonil is the only availablealternative. 15. <T3>Peaches and Nectarines. </T3>In 1985, EPA's assessment was that theloss of captan on peaches would result in annual losses to growers rangingfrom $2.3 million to $5 million due to increased disease control costsand lost peach production. The loss of captan on nectarines was estimatedto result in losses of up to $650,000 per year. It was thought likely thatthese costs would be passed on to the consumer. Industry's Captan Task Force expressed concern about the potential lossof captan on peaches. They estimated that between 90 and 100 percent ofpeach acreage is treated at least once with captan and that it is importantto growers because of its low price and because it is not subject to resistancebuild-up. Captan can be used in combination with many products includingbenomyl, dodine and thiophanate-methyl. In California, labelling requirementsprohibit the use of benomyl alone on peaches and nectarines. They believethat cancellation of captan would leave them without an affordable, effectivebrown rot control agent. The only non-chemical control mentioned by theCaptan Task Force was for anthracnose, on both peaches and nectarines.They suggest that nurseries should be cleaned before trees are sold inorder to reduce inoculum, and suggest increased mowing and herbicide useto control vegetation. The South Carolina Peach Council and Promotion Board commented that captanis invaluable in the control of bacterial spot, brown rot, blossom blightand scab which all occur frequently in the state's damp and humid climate.EPA also received comments from the North Carolina Peach Grower's Society,Inc. expressing its members' concern over the proposed cancellation ofcaptan. In their view, captan has been more effective than sulfur whichthey regard as the only available alternative. The Louisiana Cooperative Extension Service expressed their concern aboutthe proposed cancellation of captan on peaches. Its alternatives were describedas including chlorothalonil, benomyl and triforine. Captan has been usedfor 20 to 25 years on this crop at an estimated rate of 5,000 pounds ofactive ingredient per year. <T3>Conclusion: </T3>EPA estimates that about 60 percent of peaches and60 percent of nectarines are treated with captan. EPA's current estimateof the impact of cancelling the registered use of captan on peaches isthat it would result in a $30.00 per acre increase in treatment costs annuallyof up to $5 million per year overall. There were no benefits data submittedon nectarines to suggest that EPA should change its earlier benefit assessmentof this captan use. EPA maintains its position that the loss of captanon nectarines would result in increased disease control costs of up to$650,000 annually. As stated in the PD 2/3, while the consumer would probablynot experience price increases initially if the use of captan is not availableon peaches and nectarines, the costs resulting from the unavailabilityof captan may be passed on if fungicidal resistance continues to develop.16. <T3>Pears. </T3>EPA's PD 2/3 assessment of the benefits of captan on pearswas that its use on this crop was not significant. Currently available data indicate that most pears produced in the UnitedStates are grown on the West Coast. California and Washington each accountfor about 36 percent, and Oregon produces about 24 percent of this crop.Industry's Captan Task Force reports that there is little pre-harvest useof captan on pears. The major disease that is controlled by pre-harvesttreatment with captan: pear scab, is rare and geographically concentratedand that there are viable alternatives to captan.  The Task Force also reports that captan is not used as a post-harvesttreatment in California which has a dry growing season. However, industrydata indicate there are significant benefits associated with the post-harvestuse of captan on pears in Washington and Oregon. Approximately 60 percentof the packing houses in Washington and about one-third of those in Oregon,where there are cool, wet periods, use a combination of captan and benomylas a post-harvest treatment. The Task Force estimates that half of the188,000 tons of pears currently treated with captan would be lost if captanwere not available because the benzimidazoles are not registered, or noteffective for controlling Mucor molds or shot-hole in pears. The economicimpact of this loss has been estimated by the Washington Tree Fruit Researchand Extension Center to be approximately $18 million in Washington andby the Hood River Experiment Station, Oregon State University to be $7million in Oregon (References 10 and 19 in the Task Force submission).<T3>Conclusion:</T3> EPA concludes that captan is not important as a pre-harvesttreatment on pears but estimates that about 35 percent of pears are treatedpost-harvest with captan. While EPA may not agree with the comments receivedas to the exact magnitude of the estimated benefits, it agrees that thereare significant benefits of at least $16.3 million annually from the post-harvestuse of captan on pears.17.<T3> Peppers and pimentos.</T3> The PD 2/3 did not address the use of captanon peppers and pimentos specifically but considered this use with othervegetable uses of captan as a group. EPA had no information to suggestthat captan is important for disease control on this crop.Information received since the PD 2/3 indicates that captan is importantas a plant-bed treatment for peppers and pimentos. Captan is importantin slowing the build-up of resistance to metalaxyl which is the only alternativefor plant-bed treatments for these crops. EPA believes that there is littleuse of captan as a foliar treatment for which the alternatives are a combinationof fixed copper and maneb, zineb, ziram and metalaxyl.<T3>Conclusion:</T3> In its current assessment, EPA believes that captanis important for disease control as a plant bed or flat treatment but notas a foliar treatment for peppers and pimentos.18.<T3> Plums/Prunes.</T3> In EPA's PD 2/3 on captan in 1985, only limiteddata were available on the use of captan on plums/prunes and no economicassessment was provided. Comments received from the Captan Task Force indicatethat plums are rarely infested with disease and that very little plum acreageis treated with captan. Their data show that the alternatives to captanincluding triforine and iprodione provide equal or better control for brownrot.However, information provided by the Captan Task Force indicates that captanis used on most prune acreage. It is the only chemical available for thecontrol of russet scab and is highly effective in controlling brown rot.The Task Force predict substantial increases in disease control costs ifcaptan were not available for this use.California Prune, Raisin and Walnut Research of Fresno, California commentedthat one advantage of captan for prune and raisin growers is that it protectsthe crops from a fairly broad spectrum of organisms at a reasonable cost.Another perceived advantage of captan is that it fits better than its alternativesinto an Integrated Pest Management program because it does not evoke resistanceand does not affect beneficial non-target organisms such as mites.<T3>Conclusion:</T3> EPA now estimates that about 85 percent of prunesare treated with captan by foliar application and believes there are significantbenefits from this use of captan. EPA agrees with the Task Force that thereis probably minimal use of captan on plums other than prunes.19.<T3> Spinach.</T3> In the PD 2/3 EPA had no information available on thebenefit of having captan available for use on spinach. Current informationshows that captan is recommended for damping-off control as a pre-plantsoil treatment in New York. The alternative to captan for plant-bed treatmentis metalaxyl. Captan is not registered for foliar use on spinach.<T3>Conclusion: </T3>EPA estimates that less than 5 percent of U.S. spinachacreage is treated with captan; however the only alternative to captanfor plant-bed treatment is metalaxyl and captan is beneficial in slowingthe build-up of resistance to this alternative. EPA now believes that insome areas the use of captan as a plant-bed treatment for spinach has substantialbenefits.20.<T3> Strawberries.</T3> In 1985 EPA expected major losses to occur forproducers if captan were not available for use on strawberries. It wasestimated that without captan, growers would use some combination of thiramand vinclozolin which would increase annual treatment costs by about $5.9million. EPA anticipated that producers would pass on these increased costsof about $200 per acre to the consumer which would result in only a smallchange in typical fresh fruit expenditures.Comments received from a registrant disagreed with EPA's assessment thatthere would be only a small consumer impact if captan were cancelled. Theyexpressed their concern about the problem of resistance to captan's alternativesand their position that the build-up of resistance was being delayed byan alternating treatment schedule using vinclozolin and a combination ofcaptan and benomyl.The Captan Task Force's recent assessment of the resistance problem isthat without captan, chemical costs to growers would increase significantlyif they attempted other methods of disease control and that it is likelythat many growers would stop producing this crop. The Task Force estimatesthat 12 to 20 alternating applications of vinclozolin and benomyl wouldbe necessary without captan which has a broader spectrum of control andhas not shown resistance problems.Comments received from the Florida Strawberry Growers Association in supportof the continued availability of captan noted that Florida's temperatureand humidity make the systematic application of captan essential for diseasecontrol. They asked that any data being considered in the decision to cancelcaptan should include data specific to Florida where all of the 4,900 acresproducing strawberries are treated with captan. A plant pathologist from the Louisiana Cooperative Extension Service, LouisianaState University Agricultural Center also supported the continued availabilityof captan, particularly on strawberries, noting that there are very fewalternatives to captan on this crop. Information received from USDA indicates that captan is widely used onstrawberries with 60 to almost 100 percent of the crop treated dependingon the state. <T3>Conclusion: </T3>EPA agrees that a high percentage of the U.S. strawberrycrop is treated with captan: approximately 85 percent nationwide, and continuesto believe that without the use of captan, producers of strawberries wouldhave significant cost increases estimated at about $5.9 million per year.In addition, EPA agrees that captan may provide a deterrent to the developmentof fungal resistance. 21. <T3>Taro. </T3>In the PD 2/3, taro was grouped with other vegetables forwhich EPA had no information indicating that there were significant benefitsfrom the use of captan. Current information indicates that captan is theonly remaining fungicide for use on taro. It is used as a pre-plant soiltreatment to prevent Pythium soft rot of corms. <T3>Conclusion: </T3>EPA's assessment is that this use of captan has significantbenefits even though less than 10 percent of this crop is treated withcaptan. 22. <T3>Tomatoes. </T3>There was no information available to EPA on captan'suse on tomatoes and the PD 2/3 did not address this use specifically; however,EPA did not believe that there were major benefits from the use of captanon vegetable crops. Industry's Captan Task Force submitted information showing that there islittle use of captan on tomatoes and, in their assessment, little if anybenefit is derived from this use. EPA estimates that less than 1 percent of tomatoes are treated with captannationwide. However, information has been submitted by the USDA claimingthat captan is used on 100 percent of the Tennessee tomato crop as a plant-beddrench. In addition, information received from a University of Tennesseeplant pathologist, indicates that there are no effective alternatives tocaptan for this use. EPA has not received any information showing benefitsfrom foliar uses of captan on tomatoes. <T3>Conclusion: </T3>EPA agrees that captan can be important for use ontomatoes as a plant-bed treatment in certain areas but not as a foliartreatment. 23. <T3>Other fruits and vegetables. </T3>In the PD 2/3, EPA assessed the impactof the cancellation of captan for a group of fruit and vegetable crops(including cherries, citrus, grapes, papaya, pears, plums, prunes and taro)as between $1.2 and $3 million. At that time, data were not available tomake more specific estimates although EPA believed that it was unlikelythat individual producers would be faced with major losses. 24. <T3>Seed Treatments. </T3>In the PD 2/3, EPA assessed the impacts of cancellingthe use of captan as a seed treatment. The use of captan on the followingseed was discussed: corn, cotton, sorghum, soybeans, peanuts, rice, smallgrains, potatoes, and vegetables. EPA estimated that approximately $9 millionin benefits may be realized from the availability of captan as a seed treatment.No additional information was submitted to EPA which would require thisestimate to be revised. Some of the sites for which EPA did not have data previously have alreadybeen described in Unit IV.A 1 through 24 of this Notice. Based on informationreceived since the PD 2/3, EPA maintains its position that there are benefitsin having captan available for some of these crops (e.g., cherries, grapes,plums/prunes and taro). After evaluating the data and comments receivedon other fruit and vegetable crops (e.g., citrus and many vegetable crops),EPA believes that there are minimal, if any, benefits in having captanavailable for use on these sites. Listed in the following Table 4 are the registered food uses of captanthat are not discussed in Unit IV.A 1 through 24. For most of the siteslisted, captan is used on less than one percent of the crop nationwideand viable economic alternatives to captan are available. Also listed area few of the registered uses of captan for which EPA has no indicationof use.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>4_<T4>Summary of Other Crops With Minimal Use and Adequate Viable Alternativesor With No Indication of Use </T4><H1>Use</H1><H1>Percent of site treated</H1><H1>Economic alternatives</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Avocado<D>andless;1</D><D>benomyl, fixed coppers. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Beans \1\<D>andless;1</D><D>metalaxyl, sulfur, zineb. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Beets<D>andless;10</D><D>fixed coppers, zineb. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Broccoli<D>andless;1</D><D>thiram, benomyl, hot water treatment. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Brussels sprouts<D>andless;1</D><D>thiram, benomyl, hot water treatment. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cabbage<D>andless;1</D><D>thiram, benomyl, hot water treatment. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Carrots <D>andless;5</D><D>chlorothalonil, mancozeb, maneb, zineb, triphenyltin hydroxide. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cauliflower<D>andless;1</D><D>thiram, benomyl, hot water treatment. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Citrus<D>andless;1</D><D>coppers, benomyl, imazalil, Biphenyl, sodium ortho-phenylphate, thiabendazole.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Collards <D>andless;1</D><D>thiram, benomyl, hot water treatment. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cotton<D/><D>etridiazole (Terrazole</D>), PCNB, 2-(thiocyanomethylthio), benzothiazole(TCMTB), thiram + carboxin/+ chloroneb/+ fenaminosulf. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Crabapple \2\ </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Kale <D>andless;1 </D><D>thiram, benomyl, hot water treatment. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Leeks \2\ </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Mustard greens<D>andless;1</D><D>thiram, benomyl, hot water treatment. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Peas <D>andless;1</D><D>metalaxyl, zineb, fixed coppers. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pineapple <D>andless;1 </D><D>benomyl, fosetyl-Al (Aliette</D>). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Potatoes <D>andless;1</D><D>metalaxyl, maneb, mancozeb metiram, chlorothalonil, TPTH + mancozeb.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pumpkin/Squash <D>andless;5</D><D>chlorothalonil, mancozeb, maneb + zinc, anilazine, ziram, metiram. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Quince \2\<D/><D>lime sulfur, chlorothalonil, mancozeb, ziram. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Rhubarb \1\<D/><D>dichloran (Botran</D>), maneb. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Rutabaga <D>andless;1</D><D>thiram, benomyl, hot water treatment. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Shallots \2\ </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Soybeans <D>andless;1</D><D> maneb + zinc, chloroneb, carboxin + thiram, PCNB + Terrazole</D>,metalaxyl. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Sweet corn <D>andless;1</D><D>mancozeb, chlorothalonil. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Turnips \2\<D/><D>thiram, benomyl, hot water treatment. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Watermelon <D>andless;10</D><D>chlorothalonil, mancozeb, maneb + zinc, anilazine, ziram, metiram. </D><F>\1\ Beans: VA: 75% (6,200 acres); Broccoli: TN: 100 (100 acres); Rhubarb:MI: greenhouses. </F><F>\2\ No indication of use.</F></ITAG></ITAG> B. Non-Food Uses of Captan1.<T3> Agricultural non-food uses</T3>_a.<T3> Home gardens.</T3> In the PD 2/3 it was estimated that about 100,000pounds of captan active ingredient is used in products marketed for useby home gardeners. Captan is used on a variety of sites including houseplants, ornamentals, fruits and vegetables. There were no data availableto estimate the specific benefits of captan to the home user but it wasconsidered likely that the same alternatives could be employed as for commercialsites.EPA has no data to indicate the economic impact to the home user if captanis not available. However, for those sites for which there are establishedmarkets, use is occurring and few alternatives are available. It is EPA'sposition that the marketability of this broadspectrum fungicide in thehome user market is testimony to its perceived benefits.b.<T3> Forest nurseries.</T3> EPA previously believed that there were adequatealternatives to captan to control damping-off in forest nurseries. In thePD 2/3 it was estimated that captan is used to treat about 8 percent ofthe U.S. forest nursery acreage. No comments or additional informationon this use were submitted in response to the captan PD 2/3 and EPA hasnot revised its estimate of usage. However, the additional informationreceived about the benefit of having captan available for plant-bed treatmentsof captan food uses has led EPA to revise its position that the alternatives(thiram, dazomet, TCMTB and ETCMTD plus thiophanate-methyl) are not alwaysequivalent to captan in controlling damping-off. EPA now believes thatthere is some benefit to having this use of captan available.c.<T3> Turf.</T3> In the PD 2/3 it was estimated that less than 1 percentof turf in the United States is treated with captan. Thiram was believedto be the only alternative which provides protection against a comparablerange of diseases. EPA has received no additional information on this captanuse and supports its previous finding that the use of thiram in place ofcaptan would result in an annual increase in disease control costs of about$28,000.d.<T3> Ornamentals.</T3> EPA concluded in the PD 2/3 that the principal usesof captan on ornamentals are for the control of certain disease on carnations,corm rot on gladiolus, and selected diseases on field grown roses. It wasestimated that there would be cost increases for each of these sites ifcaptan were not available. The costs of alternatives were expected to rangefrom $40,000 on gladiolus to about $96,000 on roses.In contrast to the relatively minor additional production costs for cormsand roses, it was estimated that the loss of captan would have a majorimpact on the carnation cut flower industry. Losses were estimated at $6million per year for the domestic carnation cutting producers (producingplants for flower growers) and up to $12 million in losses from loss ofplantings due to increased disease pressure.EPA has received no additional data on the uses of captan on ornamentalsand supports its earlier assessment of the benefits of captan for theseuses.2.<T3> Non-agricultural uses_</T3>a.<T3> Soaps/pet shampoos/pet powders.</T3> EPA has no new information onthe use of captan in sanitizing deodorant-powdered hand soap and supportsits position in the PD 2/3 that there is some benefit in having captanavailable as an antimicrobial agent in powdered soap.EPA's position on pet shampoos and pet powders was that there were no registeredalternatives to captan for these uses and that having captan availabletherefore provided some benefits.EPA  supports  its  position  in  the  PD 2/3 that there are some benefitsto having captan registered for use in pet powders and pet shampoos.The registrant of the only remaining registration of a pet shampoo/dipcontaining captan requested that it be voluntarily cancelled (January,1989).b.<T3> Plastics/paints/adhesives/aerosol sprays/packing boxes.</T3> In thePD 2/3 EPA estimated that there were some benefits to the uses of captanas a biocide incorporated in plastics, adhesives (including wallpaper pastes),oil and water based paints, fabric for mattresses and pillows, aerosolsprays and packing boxes used in transporting fruits and vegetables. EPAdid not calculate the economic benefits of having captan available foreach of these products but estimated that there were at least minimal benefitsto these minor uses of captan.EPA has not received any additional information regarding these productsand therefore supports its previous position that there are minimal benefitsfrom these uses.C. ConclusionsEPA underestimated the benefits associated with the use of captan on food(excluding seed treatments) in the PD 2/3. It was estimated that theseuses resulted in benefits ranging from $11.3 to $23.7 million. Based oninformation received subsequent to the issuance of the PD 2/3, EPA nowbelieves these uses account for between $67.8 to $75.1 million in benefits.No information was submitted regarding the non-food uses that would requireEPA to revise its earlier assessment of benefits. EPA's revised estimateof benefits resulting from all uses of captan is now estimated to be $76.8to $96.1 million.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Comments of the Scientific Advisory Panel Secretary of Agriculture</ITAG>A. Comments of the Scientific Advisory PanelEPA presented its proposed decision on captan at a public meeting of theScientific Advisory Panel held in Arlington, Virginia, on September 26,1985. The Panel issued its response in a written report of October 4, 1985.The Panel's report is reproduced below in its entirety. The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) ScientificAdvisory Panel (SAP) has completed review of a set of scientific issuesassociated with captan. The review was conducted in an open meeting heldin Arlington, Virginia, on September 26, 1985. All Panel members were present.In addition, two new designees to the SAP, Dr. Thomas Clarkson and Dr.James Swenberg, participated in the review.Public notice of the meeting was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on Friday, August 30, 1985. Oral and written statements were received from Stauffer Chemical Companyand Chevron Chemical Company. In consideration of all matters brought out during the meeting and carefulreview of all documents presented, the Panel unanimously submits the followingreport: <ITAG tagnum="74">Report of SAP Recommendations </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Scientific Advisory Panel has reviewed the materials preparedfor it on captan, and responds as follows to the issues presented to itby EPA. The four scientific questions posed to the SAP by EPA, are listedbelow, together with the Panel's response: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Issue: </T3>1. Several studies have shown that captan is oncogenicin a number of species of test animals: Innes et al., 1969 (mice); NationalCancer Institute, I977 (mice and rats); Chevron, 1981 (mice); Bio/Dynamics,1983 (mice); Stauffer/Chevron, 1982 (rats). Does the Panel agree with EPA'squalitative assessment (i.e., weight of the evidence conclusions) of theoncogenic potential of captan. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Response: </T3>One mouse study demonstrates oncogenic effects in theduodenum of mice exposed to high doses. Two other studies are less convincing,but are supportive because they indicate tumors at the same site. The ratstudies are equivocal at best in indicating oncogenicity. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Issue: </T3>2. EPA calculated the geometric mean of five oncogenicitystudies to determine the potency value (Q<T2>1</T2>*) captan. Does the Panel agree with EPA that this approach isappropriate for estimating dietary and applicator risk. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Response: </T3>Absolutely not. The Panel does not believe this approachis useful because the five studies are not of equal value. Furthermore,the Panel has grave reservations over the procedures and assumptions thatgo into determination and use of Q star values. The Panel feels that Agencyposition documents must stress upper and lower bounds, and provide thebest estimate. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Issue: </T3>3. In the absence of acceptable field data on residuesof captan in or on food crops, EPA conducted a ``worst-case'' calculationof dietary risk. Are the methods used for estimating human dietary exposureto captan appropriate? To what degree should EPA use FDA's Market Basketsurvey data? </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Response: </T3>The Panel does not believe the methods used for estimatinghuman dietary exposure to captan are appropriate. First of all, the Paneldisagrees with EPA's practice of estimating human dietary exposures basedon tolerances. EPA should use the best available residue data. In thiscase, the FDA's Market Basket Survey data should have been used to themaximum extent possible. If EPA does not wish to use Market Basket Surveydata, there are alternative methods available for making estimates morerealistic. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Issue: </T3>4. Available data (Robens, 1970) suggested possible teratogeniceffects in hamsters. These effects were encephaly and fused ribs and occurredonly at maternally toxic levels. Additional information from a second study(Goldenthal, 1978) on the hamster demonstrated only fetotoxic effects.These effects were reduction in fetal weight at maternally toxic levels.Does the Panel concur with EPA's judgment that captan is not teratogenicin the hamster? The Panel should note that the PD 2/3 indicates currentstudies were inadequate and that an additional study on hamsters wouldbe required. However, subsequently EPA has conducted a reregistration reviewand determined that an additional hamster study is not needed. That reviewis enclosed for the Panel's consideration. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Response: </T3>The Panel concurs with EPA's judgment. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For the Chairman. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Certified as an accurate report of findings:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Philip H. Gray, Jr., Executive Secretary, FIFRA Scientific AdvisoryPanel</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Date: October 4, 1985.</ITAG><T3>EPA response: </T3>The SAP's evaluation of EPA's qualitative assessmentof the oncogenic potential of captan (issue 1) and the Panel's findingthat EPA's initial method of determining the potency or Q<T2>1</T2>* of this fungicide was inappropriate (issue 2) were taken intoconsideration in EPA's Second Peer Review of captan. The Second Peer Reviewand determination of a new Q<T2>1</T2>* for captan are discussed in Unit II.A.6. of this Notice. The Panel disagreed with EPA's use of tolerances in estimating dietaryexposure to captan (issue 3). In this final determination on captan, EPAhas used the best available residue data which includes field monitoringdata received since the PD 2/3 was issued; tolerances were only used incalculating exposure to crops for which no better data are available. Dietaryexposure to captan is discussed in Unit III.A. of this Notice. In concluding this Special Review of captan, EPA notes the SAP's concurrencewith EPA's finding that captan does not cause teratogenic effects (issue4). Teratogenicity is discussed in Unit II.C. of this Notice. B.

The preliminarydata we are currently receiving from the states indicate that the usesof these fungicides are essentially the same as discussed in these earlierreports. The major difference lies in the fact that pest resistance topesticides has become an important factor in the use of the more recentlydeveloped systemic fungicides. Because these newer fungicides are highlyspecific in their modes of action, pest resistance is likely to occur relativelysoon if these chemicals are used exclusively. States have developed resistancemanagement programs that rely heavily upon the inclusion of captan and/orEBDC fungicides in concert with the highly specific newer chemicals.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">If you find it imperative to make a decision before the completionof our new study on chemical disease control, we urge you to take advantageof the material already submitted.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Sincerely,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Charles L.

This information is referred to throughoutUnit IV. of this Notice which summarizes EPA's benefits assessment andevaluation of comments and additional data received in response to thePD 2/3. EPA has also considered the problem of resistance, particularlyresistance to the newer site-specific fungicides and has addressed theavailability of viable alternatives to captan, including the EBDCs as partof its fungicide strategy. Both resistance problems and alternative fungicidesare discussed in Units IV. and VI. of this document.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Risk/Benefit Assessment and Initiation of Regulatory Actions</ITAG>A. IntroductionIn its PD 2/3, EPA estimated the total dietary risk from captan food usesas 10^4 to 10^3. EPA proposed to cancel the use of captan products forall food crops but to require additional residue data to determine actualfood residue levels before making a final determination. The decision tocancel all food uses of captan was based on the conclusion that the cancerrisks outweighed the moderate benefits.In the absence of more accurate data on likely residues EPA based the calculationsof dietary risk on established tolerances which represent the highest residuelevels which may legally be present on food crops treated with captan.EPA proposed to retain any use for which there were data showing that anticipatedresidues are sufficiently lower than the tolerances.EPA further proposed to permit the use of captan as a seed or seed piecetreatment but to require submission of residue data to establish tolerancesfor treated seed and to determine whether the residues, if detectable,are of concern. The data are to be submitted in July, 1989.EPA also proposed to allow the continued use of captan detreated corn seedas feed for cattle and hogs. A tolerance of 100 ppm on detreated corn seedwas established in November, 1981 in connection with 40 CFR 186.500 (formerlycodified as 21 FR 561.65). Additional residue data necessary to supportthis tolerance have not been submitted and consequently EPA will be proposingto revoke this tolerance through a notice in the <T4> Federal Register.</T4> The risks from non-dietary exposure to captan ranged from 10^5 to 10^4for animal shampoos to ``negligible'' for uses including industrial incorporationof captan in plastics and paints. The highest and most typical risks formixer/loaders and applicators were 10^6 to 10^5. The risk from exposureto home garden uses of captan was calculated as 10^7.EPA proposed measures that would reduce these non-dietary exposure levels.For persons mixing or loading formulations, applying captan, harvestingor weeding in captan treated areas, incorporating captan in adhesives,paints and plastics or using products containing captan, EPA proposed torequire the use of protective clothing and other safety measures. Thesemeasures included the use of dust masks and protective suits for mixer/loadersand the use of chemical resistant gloves for all uses of captan. Labelchanges resulting from these proposals were specified in the RegistrationStandard issued in March, 1986 and amendments issued in April 1986 and1987.B. Risk/Benefit Assessment: General1.<T3> Risks.</T3> Additional data and comments were received in responseto the PD 2/3 and in response to Data Call-In Notices issued under FIFRAsection 3(c)(2)(B). EPA has reviewed these submissions and they are presentedand discussed in the appropriate units of this Notice.Based on all the available evidence, EPA supports its earlier classificationof captan as a Group B<T2>2</T2> (probable human) carcinogen. The new overall Q<T2>1</T2>* for captan, based on the Chevron high-dose study (Ref. 7) showingtumors of the gastrointestinal tract in both male and female mice, is 3.6x 10^3 (mg/kg/day)^1 (geometric mean). The data do not, however, show thatcaptan causes teratogenic, reproductive or mutagenic effects that warrantEPA concern.The upper-bound lifetime oncogenic risk from dietary exposure to captanfrom all registered food uses is now estimated to be 10^6 to 10^5. Thisis the sum of the risks from the more than 60 food uses of captan. Thereis no individual crop for which the risk is higher than 10^6. As discussedin Unit III of this Notice, the dietary exposure estimates were based onthe best data available to EPA. Although most of these data more accuratelyreflect levels likely to be consumed in the diet than those in the PD 2/3,EPA still believes that actual dietary exposure, and thus risk, is overestimated.The risks from non-dietary exposure to captan range from 10<T3>^</T3>7 to 10<T3>^</T3>5 for mixer/loaders and applicators for agricultural uses ofcaptan. In the PD 2/3 risks for fieldworkers/harvesters were estimatedat 10<T3>^</T3>6 to 10<T3>^</T3>4 based on studies on exposure to captan on strawberries. EPAwill reevaluate these risks when additional data, recently received byEPA, have been reviewed. The risks from home uses of products containing captan include estimatesof 10<T3>^</T3>5 for oil-based paints and 10<T3>^</T3>7 for home garden products. The calculations of risks for homeuses of captan do not assume that the user is wearing protective clothingand gloves. They therefore represent a conservative estimate of risk tothe home user. Protective clothing and other safety measures, some of which were proposedin the PD 2/3, have been specified through the captan Registration Standardand amendments. In general, it is anticipated that compliance with thesemeasures will reduce the risks from non-dietary exposure to captan by oneorder of magnitude. 2. <T3>Alternatives. </T3>The PD 2/3 contained a table of the major alternativesto captan and a summary of their toxicological effects.

All captafol registrations and all folpet food use registrationswere voluntarily cancelled in 1987. Of the alternatives to captan, onlychlorothalonil and the EBDCs (mancozeb, maneb, metiram and zineb) are B<T2>2</T2> carcinogens. Available data indicate the remaining alternativesare either not oncogenic, have only limited evidence regarding carcinogenicity,or do not have adequate oncogenicity testing. While benomyl is a positivecarcinogen, teratogen, and reproductive toxicant, EPA has recently evaluatedthe risks to benomyl (Registration Standard issued July, 1987), and hasdetermined those risks to be acceptable. Also, due to resistance problems,benomyl would not likely increase much in market share if captan were cancelled.Since captan is a broad spectrum fungicide, cancellation of its use ona particular site would likely result in the use of two or more of itsalternatives. Only the EBDCs and chlorothalonil offer the breadth of controlthat captan does; consequently, although cancellation of the use of captancould result in the use of a pesticide that is a less potent carcinogenor not carcinogenic, more pesticide applications would likely be requiredto achieve an equivalent level of control. Additionally, captan has beenfound not to be teratogenic or mutagenic and there are no concerns regardingreproductive effects, whereas there are concerns for some of these effectsfor a number of captan's alternatives. As part of EPA's comparative risk/benefit assessment of major fungicides,the dietary risks for various possible cancellation scenarios for the B<T2>2</T2> fungicides, captan, chlorothalonil and the EBDCs, were evaluated.The EBDCs are currently in Special Review and EPA's Preliminary Noticeof Determination (PD2/3) on the risks and benefits from their use is scheduledto be issued shortly. Chlorothalonil has recently been re-evaluated throughEPA's reregistration process. Risks from dietary exposure to this fungicideare estimated at 10^6 from chlorothalonil and 10^6 from the contaminanthexachlorobenzene (HCB), which has also been identified as a B<T2>2</T2> (probable human) oncogen. The risks from chlorothalonil do notmeet the criteria for initiating a Special Review at this time. A draftGuidance For The Reregistration of Pesticide Products Containing Chlorothalonilwas issued in September 1988. The likely shifts in use patterns were assessed using information on whichfungicides are registered for different use sites, and on EPA's assessmentof the viability, in terms of efficacy and costs, of the remaining alternatives.EPA estimated the potential changes in risks from consumption of captan,EBDCs, or chlorothalonil residues if one or more of the three fungicideswere cancelled. None of these cancellation scenarios caused a significant(i.e., greater than one-half an order of magnitude) increase in the overallestimated dietary risks posed by captan, chlorothalonil or the EBDCs. EPAundertook this assessment in order to determine whether the cancellationof all or some uses of these fungicides would result in unacceptable increasesin risks. 3. <T3>Benefits. </T3>The benefits from food uses of captan are summarizedin Unit IV. of this Notice. The majority of the comments received in responseto EPA's PD 2/3 concerned the benefits of retaining captan for use on specificcrops. Comments also addressed the problem of resistance to some of thealternative fungicides. EPA has revised its benefits assessment as the result of these commentsand other information received subsequent to the issuance of the captanPD 2/3. Benefits were assessed in terms of the economic impacts resultingfrom the cancellation of the use of captan and subsequent switching toalternative pest management practices. The effect of cancellation is expectedto result in losses ranging from approximately $76.8 to $96.1 million dollars.These losses include $67.8 to $75.1 million in benefits from food usesand approximately $9 million from seed treatments. Losses to the ornamentalindustry could be as high as $l2 million without the use of captan. Other benefits are also recognized from the availability of captan althoughthey are not quantifiable. Captan is important in preventing or delayingfungal resistance to other fungicides. For example, resistance problemswith other fungicides would be expected to develop within 2 years on applesand cherries without the availability of captan. C. Risk/Benefit Assessment: Specific 1. <T3>Dietary Risk. </T3>EPA has determined that the oncogenic risks resultingfrom dietary exposure to captan from all treated crops pose an unreasonableadverse effect and that these risks need to be reduced in order to ensurethat the benefits of use outweigh the cumulative risks of use. The PD 2/3for captan proposed cancellation of all food uses based on cumulative dietaryrisks estimated to be in the 10^4 to 10^3 range. As discussed in Unit IIIof this Notice, EPA has calculated the dietary risks of captan in lightof additional information obtained subsequent to the PD 2/3. The upper-boundoncogenic lifetime risk from dietary exposure to captan from all treatedcrops is estimated to be in the 10^6 to 10^5 range for the general population.EPA considered two options for reducing these risks: cancellation of allfood uses as proposed in the PD 2/3; and cancellation of some food usesto bring cumulative dietary risk from captan into balance with the benefits.In determining which food uses to cancel, EPA considered the benefits resultingfrom use on each individual commodity and compared those benefits to therisk posed from dietary exposure to residues of captan on the commodity.Recognizing the overall importance of captan as an agricultural fungicidein both the economic benefits it provides and the importance of its rolein delaying or preventing resistance of fungal organisms to other pesticides,EPA examined ways of reducing risks to the point where the cumulative benefitsfrom captan use outweighed its cumulative risks. The individual dietary risk resulting from exposure to commodities containingcaptan residues ranges from 10^12 to 10^6. Although many of the individualrisks posed by certain food uses are very minimal, EPA believes the cumulativerisk of 10^6 to 10^5 from all food uses to be unacceptable, even in lightof benefits of $67.8 to $75.1 million. The benefits of the use of captan on individual food commodities are discussedin detail in Unit IV of this Notice. In identifying the benefits of theuses of captan, EPA found that there were virtually no, or very minimal,benefits on a number of food commodities.

EPA calculated the cumulative risk from all 24 fooduses which were identified as having such benefits. These are: Almonds,apples (pre- and post-harvest), apricots, blackberries, blueberries, celery(plant-bed), cherries (pre- and post-harvest), dewberries, eggplant (plant-bed),grapes, green onions, lettuce, mangoes, nectarines, peaches, pears (post-harvestonly), plums/prunes, peppers (plant-bed), pimentos (plant-bed), raspberries,spinach (plant-bed), strawberries, taro and tomatoes (plant-bed). The cumulative risk resulting from these uses poses an upper-bound lifetimeoncogenic risk from dietary exposure to captan of 10<T3>^</T3>6 for the overall U.S. population. EPA believes this risk levelis overstated, as discussed in Unit III, due to assumptions made regardingmilk residues and the use of tolerance levels to calculate some food userisks. The cumulative economic benefits resulting from the use of captanon these commodities are estimated at $67.8 to $75.1 million. EPA believesthe benefits are understated due to the unquantified value of captan inslowing or preventing the build-up of resistance to other pesticides andtheir utility in Integrated Pest Management (IPM) programs. EPA believesthat the total quantified and unquantified benefits from these 24 fooduses outweigh the estimated risk. The remaining uses (avocado, beans, beets, broccoli, Brussels sprouts,cabbage, carrots, cantaloupe/muskmelon, cauliflower, celery (foliar), collards,cotton, crabapple, cranberries, cucumber, eggplant (foliar), grapefruit,honeydew, kale, leeks, lemons, limes, mustard greens, onions (dry bulb),oranges, pears (pre-harvest), peas, pineapple, potatoes, pumpkin, rhubarb,rutabaga, shallots, soybeans, squash, sweet corn, tangerines, tomatoes(foliar), turnips, and watermelon) have no identifiable benefits. Whilenone of these crops individually poses a risk of concern, collectivelythey result in an aggregate dietary risk from consumption of captan treatedcrops in the 10<T3>^</T3>6 range. Given that there are no offsetting benefits, EPA considersthe risk from these uses to be unreasonable. 2. <T3>Non-dietary. </T3>EPA has also examined the risks posed from non-dietaryexposure to captan. The PD 2/3 proposed certain precautionary measuresin order to reduce non-dietary exposure and consequently risk. The CaptanRegistration Standard, and amendments to it, specified similar measures.Many of the measures proposed in the PD 2/3 and specified in the RegistrationStandard contain precautionary information which should be followed whenhandling any pesticide. The following Table 7 shows the estimated risksto persons exposed to captan through various activities both without anyparticular protective clothing or measures and with the protective measuresspecified for captan previously in the Registration Standard. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s200,xs84,xs108 </C><T4>Table </T4>7.<T4>_Summary of Non-Dietary Risks </T4><H1>User </H1><H1>Risks (in PD 2/3) without protecttive measures </H1><H1>Risks with protective measures specified in Registration Standard</H1> <T4>A.

The PD 2/3 proposed protective measures for agriculturalnon-food uses but did not for agricultural food uses since cancellationof these uses was proposed due to the dietary risk concerns. However, protectivemeasures for mixers/loaders and applicators for agricultural food useswere specified in the Captan Registration Standard pending EPA's FinalDetermination. EPA estimates that the resulting risks from implementationof these protective measures are 10^8 to 10^6 for agricultural food usesand 10^7 to 10^6 for agricultural non-food uses. The risk to persons applying captan to home gardens, yards, and/or houseplants was estimated in the PD 2/3 to be 10^7. These estimates assume thata short-sleeved shirt and long pants are worn. The protective measures,including the use of chemical resistant gloves, specified in the RegistrationStandard and amendments would reduce exposure to these home uses of captan.However, no risk reduction is assumed in Table 7 since EPA assumed a worstcase situation where these measures will not be adhered to. The estimated risks from exposure to oil-base paint end-use products containingcaptan were estimated, in the PD 2/3, to be 10^5 for commercial applicators.The PD 2/3 proposed a requirement that persons applying oil-base paintwear chemical resistant gloves. This requirement was not included in theRegistration Standard or in this Final Determination since EPA believesrisks without gloves are marginally acceptable and that a requirement towear gloves is not likely to be adhered to. The risks to mixers/loaders and applicators applying or incorporating captaninto adhesives, cosmetics, paints, and plastics was estimated to be negligiblein the PD 2/3 for all uses except adhesives which was estimated to be 10^5.The negligible risks for persons incorporating captan in cosmetics, paints,and plastics assumed that protective clothing, as proposed in the PD 2/3,is normally worn. The PD 2/3 estimate for adhesives should have similarlyassumed that protective clothing is normally worn by mixers/loaders andapplicators. Given that these protective clothing measures for mixers/loadersand applicators are already used under good industrial practices and thatresulting risks are low to negligible, EPA did not specify any protectivemeasures on these uses in the Registration Standard and is not doing soin this Final Determination. EPA has concluded that although the risks posed to mixers/loaders and applicatorsare not unreasonable given the benefits of use, the protective clothingrequirements would not reduce the benefits of use, are inexpensive andeasily obtained, and are generally followed by persons using good agriculturaland industrial practices in handling pesticides in order to reduce unnecessaryexposure. These measures were specified in the Registration Standard, andmost registrants have already modified their labels to comply with them.No additional action is being taken under this Final Determination. b. <T3>Fieldworker/harvester requirements. </T3>Limited data available toEPA at this time indicate that there is significant dermal exposure topersons working in fields treated with captan. The PD 2/3 estimated risksto range from 10^6 to 10^4. Additionally, significant dermal exposure canresult to persons entering fields treated within 4 days if adequate protectiveclothing is not worn. EPA is currently evaluating data recently receivedwhich will allow a better assessment of exposure resulting to fieldworkersand harvesters. Depending on the results of this final assessment, further regulatory actionmay be necessary. The protective clothing requirements specified in theRegistration Standard are expected to reduce risks to 10^5 to 10^7. 3. <T3>Conclusions_</T3>a. <T3>Dietary risk. </T3>The cumulative upperbound lifetime risk for allfood uses with quantifiable or identifiable benefits is 10^6. EPA believesthat the significant benefits from the use of this pesticide on these crops($67.8 to $75.l million) outweighs this level of risk, given that thisrisk estimate is conservative and that some significant benefits are unquantifiable.The remaining registered food uses collectively push the cumulative dietaryrisk from all treated crops to the 10^6 to 10^5 level. Given that theseuses result in a higher cumulative risk and contribute no offsetting benefits,EPA concludes that these uses of captan constitute an unreasonable risk.b. <T3>Non-dietary risk. </T3>A number of risk reduction measures (protectiveclothing requirements) were identified in the PD 2/3 to reduce risks tomixers, loaders, applicators, fieldworkers, and harvesters. These requirementswere subsequently specified in the Registration Standard and most registrantshave amended their labels to comply with these requirements. These requirementsconform with good practice and present minor, if any, cost to growers.Because these risks are not unreasonable even in the absence of protectiveclothing, EPA is not imposing these requirements in this Final Determination.However, EPA believes the measures constitute good practice and reducerisks and should be adhered to.D. Cancellation of Certain Uses Based on the information summarized and discussed elsewhere in this Notice,EPA has determined that certain uses of captan as currently registeredpose unreasonable dietary risk. Therefore, all products that bear useson food must limit use to the following: (a) Plant-bed treatments of captan on celery, eggplant, peppers, pimentos,spinach and tomatoes. (b) Pre-harvest uses of captan on almonds, apples, apricots, blackberries,blueberries, cherries, dewberries, grapes, green onions, lettuce, mangoes,nectarines, peaches, plums/prunes, raspberries, strawberries and taro.(c) Post-harvest uses of captan on apples, cherries and pears. (d) Seed treatment uses of captan.E. Tolerance Reductions/Revocations As a result of the actions required by this Notice and in response to additionalresidue data submitted in support of the continued registration of captanon certain food commodities, EPA will be proposing to reduce or revoketolerances for a number of food commodities. Reductions in tolerance levelswill be proposed within the next 6 months for the following raw agriculturalcommodities: apricots, cherries, nectarines, peaches, plums (fresh prunes),and tomatoes. These reductions reflect lower residues from currently labelledapplication rates, as evidenced in the recently submitted field trial residuestudies. Additionally, EPA will propose that tolerances on many of the followingraw agricultural commodities be revoked since the accompanying registrationson uses (other than seed treatments) are being cancelled: avocados, beans(dry and succulent), beets, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cantaloupe,carrots, cauliflower, collards, cotton seed, crabapples, cranberries, cucumbers,garlic, grapefruit, kale, leeks, lemons, limes, muskmelon, mustard greens,onions (dry bulb), oranges, peas, pineapple, potatoes, pumpkins, quince,rhubarb, rutabaga (roots), shallots, soybeans (dry and succulent), squash(summer and winter), sweet corn, tangerine/tangelos, turnips (roots andgreens), and watermelon. As discussed previously, EPA will also be proposing to revoke the tolerancefor residues of captan on detreated corn seed. For many of these crops,registrations also include use on seed. Seed treatment registrations arenot affected by this regulatory decision. Residue data reflecting the useof captan resulting from seed treatments are not due to be submitted untilJuly, 1989. At that time, some of these tolerances may be reduced ratherthan revoked to reflect continuing use as seed treatments. EPA intendsto review the data submitted in July, reach a regulatory decision on appropriatetolerance levels, and propose these tolerance revocation or reduction actionsprior to the end of the year. F. Provisions Governing Sale and Use of Nonconforming Stocks This section sets forth requirements concerning stocks of captan productssubject to this Notice that do not bear an approved amended label conformingto the requirements of Unit VI.D. of this Notice. Specifically, captanproducts that bear food uses must limit the food uses to the following:(a) Plant-bed treatments of captan on celery, eggplant, peppers, pimentos,spinach and tomatoes. (b) Pre-harvest uses of captan on almonds, apples, apricots, blackberries,blueberries, cherries, dewberries, grapes, green onions, lettuce, mangoes,nectarines, peaches, plums/prunes, raspberries, strawberries and taro.(c) Post-harvest uses of captan on apples, cherries and pears. (d) Seed treatment uses of captan. Non-food uses of captan are not affectedby this Notice. These requirements will apply to all nonconforming stocksincluding existing stocks of products that are cancelled pursuant to thisNotice and to stocks of products that amend their registrations pursuantto the requirements of this Notice. In both cases, this Notice requiresthat nonconforming stocks be relabeled according to specified time frames,and it prohibits use of all captan products for certain food uses afterl year from the date of publication of this Notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. For purposes of this Notice, existing stocks are defined as any quantityof captan product subject to this Notice that has been formulated, packaged,and labeled for use prior to the date by which the registration of theproduct is cancelled pursuant to this Notice. Pursuant to FIFRA section6(a)(1), the Administrator may permit the continued sale and use of existingstocks of a pesticide whose registration (is cancelled pursuant to thisNotice) to such extent, under such conditions, and for such cases as hemay specify, if he determines that such sale or use is not inconsistentwith the purposes of (FIFRA) and will not have unreasonable adverse effectson the environment. EPA has determined that limited sale and use of certainexisting stocks of captan is not inconsistent with the purposes of FIFRAand will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment. Thisdetermination was made after weighing the incremental increase in risksresulting from 1 additional year of exposure when captan is not used inaccordance with the requirements of this Notice against the incrementalbenefits of such use and the costs associated with relabeling or disposal.Accordingly, under the authority of FIFRA section 6(a)(1), EPA will permitthe continued sale and use of existing stocks of captan products for 1year from the date of publication of this Notice, provided that such saleand use is otherwise consistent with the previously approved labeling ofthe product and subject to the following conditions and limitations: Two months from the date of publication of this Notice, registrants mustaffix revised labeling to existing stocks in their possession. Such revisedlabeling must indicate that the product may not be sold after the datewhich is 1 year after the date of publication of this Notice, and may beused after that date only on the food uses identified above. After 2 months from the date of publication of this Notice, registrantsmay not sell or distribute existing stocks unless those stocks bear thisrevised labeling. Registrants are required to contact their distributors of captan productswithin 6 months of the date of publication of this Notice and inform thedistributors of the time limitations being placed on sale and use of captanexisting stocks. Registrants must also provide distributors with revisedlabeling indicating that existing stocks may not be sold after 1 year afterthe date of publication of this Notice, and may be used after that dateonly on the food uses identified above. After 6 months from the date of publication of this Notice, no person maysell or distribute existing stocks unless those stocks bear revised labeling.After l year from the date of publication of this Notice, it will be unlawfulto use existing stocks of captan except for the food uses identified above.Similar limitations apply to stocks of captan products whose registrationsare amended pursuant to the terms of this Notice. As a condition of theamended registration, registrants must affix an approved label modifiedin accordance with the requirements of this Notice to all end use productsreleased for shipment l year after the date of publication of this Notice.Further, as a condition of the amended registration, products not bearingthis approved label (i.e., products released for shipment prior to adoptionof the approved label) may only be sold and used subject to the followingconditions and limitations: Two months from the date of publication of this Notice, registrants mustaffix revised labeling to stocks in their possession not bearing approvedlabeling. Such revised labeling must indicate that the product may notbe sold after the date l year after publication of this Notice, and maybe used after that date only on the food uses identified above. After 2 months from the date of publication of this Notice, registrantsmay not sell or distribute stocks not bearing approved labeling unlessthose stocks bear this revised labeling. Registrants are required to contact their distributors of captan productswithin 6 months of the date of publication of this Notice and inform thedistributors of the time limitations being placed on sale and use of captanstocks not bearing approved labeling. Registrants must also provide distributorswith revised labeling indicating that stocks not bearing approved labelingmay not be sold after l year after the date of publication of this Notice,and may be used after that date only on the food uses identified above.After 6 months from the date of publication of this Notice, no person maysell or distribute stocks not bearing approved labeling unless those stocksbear revised labeling. After 1 year from the date of publication of thisNotice, it will be unlawful to use stocks of captan not bearing approvedlabeling except for the food uses identified above. Any disposal of nonconforming stocks must be in accordance with the requirementsof all applicable Federal, State, and local laws, including the ResourceConservation and Recovery Act. <ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Procedural Matters </ITAG>This Notice announces EPA's final decision to cancel all registrationsand to deny all applications for registration of products containing captanwhich do not comply with the modified terms and conditions of registrationset forth in this Notice. This action is being taken pursuant to authoritygranted by section 6(b) of FIFRA. Under FIFRA sections 6(b)(1) and 3(c)(6),applicants, registrants and certain other adversely affected parties mayrequest a hearing on the cancellation or denial actions that this Noticeinitiates. Any hearing concerning cancellation or denial of registrationfor any pesticide product containing captan will be held in accordancewith FIFRA section 6(d). Alternatively, registrants/applicants may applyto amend the product registrations/applications to remove the uses cancelledby this Notice within 30 days of publication of this Notice. Unless a hearingor amended registration is properly requested with regard to a particularregistration or application, the registration will be cancelled or theapplication denied. This Unit of the Notice explains how such persons mayrequest a hearing or amend their registrations in accordance with the proceduresspecified in this Notice, and the consequences of requesting or failingto request a hearing or submit an amended registration or application.A. Procedures for Requesting a Hearing To contest the regulatory action initiated by this Notice, registrants,or any applicant for registration whose application for registration isaffected by this Notice (including intrastate applicants who have previouslymarketed such products pursuant to 40 CFR 162.17), may request a hearingwithin 30 days of receipt of this Notice, or within 30 days from the dateof publication of this Notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, whichever occurs later. Any other persons adverselyaffected by the cancellation action described in this Notice, or any interestedpersons with the concurrence of an applicant whose application for registrationhas been denied, may request a hearing within 30 days of publication ofthis Notice in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4>All registrants, applicants and other adversely affected persons who requesta hearing must file the request in accordance with the procedures establishedby FIFRA and EPA's Rules of Practice Governing Hearings (40 CFR Part 164).These procedures require that all requests must identify the specific registration(s)by Registration Number(s) and the specific use(s) for which a hearing isrequested and must be received by the Hearing Clerk within the applicable30-day period. Failure to comply with these requirements will result indenial of the request for a hearing. Requests for a hearing should alsobe accompanied by objections that are specific for each use of the pesticideproduct for which a hearing is requested. Requests for a hearing must be submitted to: Hearing Clerk (A-110), EnvironmentalProtection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. 1. <T3>Consequences of filing a timely and effective hearing request. </T3>Ifa hearing on any action initiated by this Notice is requested in a timelyand effective manner, the hearing will be governed by EPA's Rules of PracticeGoverning Hearings under FIFRA section 6 (40 CFR Part 164). All hearingswill be held in Washington, DC. In the event of a hearing, each cancellationaction concerning the specific use or uses of the specific registered productwhich is the subject of the hearing will not become effective except pursuantto an order of the Administrator at the conclusion of the hearing. The hearing will be limited to the specific registrations or applicationsfor which the hearing is requested. 2. <T3>Consequences of failure to file in a timely and effective manner. </T3>Ifa hearing concerning the cancellation or denial of registration of a specificcaptan product subject to this Notice is not requested in a timely andeffective manner by the end of the applicable 30-day period, registrationof that product will be cancelled or the denial will be effective. B. Amendment of Registration or Application Registrants of captan products who are affected by this Notice of Intentto Cancel (NOIC) may avoid cancellation of their registrations withoutrequesting a hearing by filing an application for an amended registrationto amend product labeling to comply with the labeling requirements describedin Unit VI. of this NOIC. Applications containing the label modificationsrequired by this Notice must include 3 copies of the revised label. Theapproved label must be affixed to all end use products released for shipmentl year after publication of this Notice. All registrations or applicationsfor registration must be filed within 30 days of receipt of this Notice,or within 30 days of the date of publication of the final notice whicheveroccurs later. Similarly applicants for a registration that is subject tothis NOIC must file an amended application for registration within theapplicable 30-day period to avoid denial of the application. The failureto file an amendment on time or the timely filing of an inadequate amendmentwill result in automatic cancellation pursuant to FIFRA section 6(b). Registrants whose registrations become cancelled but who wish to use theexisting stocks provisions provided above must submit revised labeling,including time limitations on use, for EPA acceptance prior to the saleand distribution of such existing stocks. All applications must be addressedto: Eugene Wilson, Assistant Product Manager Number 21, Registration Division(TS-767C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency,401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. C. Separation of Functions EPA's rules of practice forbid anyone who may take part in deciding thiscase, at any stage of the proceeding, from discussing the merits of theproceeding ex parte with any party or with any person who has been connectedwith the preparation or presentation of the proceeding as an advocate orin any investigative or expert capacity, or with any of his/her representatives(40 CFR 164.7).
