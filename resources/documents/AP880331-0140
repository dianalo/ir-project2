From 1951 through 1986, there have been an average of 118tornadoes in Texas per year, according to the state climatologist'soffice in College Station.   More than 60 percent of those occur between April and June,records show. In April and June an average of 18 to 19 tornadoesoccur each month, but in May, when weather conditions are the mostunstable, that average increases to about 36.   A few twisters were already recorded in early March in Texas butthey did little or no damage. A tornado that touched down Tuesdayin central Louisiana, near Bunkie, destroyed two brick homes.   ``People should have plans of what they'll do in tornadoes. Ifthey wait until it gets there, it's going to be too late,'' saidBuddy McIntyre, a forecaster with the National Weather Service.   Last May 22, a killer storm flattened the small West Texas townof Saragosa, killing 30 people and injuring 162. In mid-November,11 people died in East Texas when a series of tornadoes trashedtowns from Cherokee County to the Gulf Coast.   ``A tornado is such a devastating kind of storm. No matter howmuch preparation you do there is some property damage and some lossof life. But there are some things you can do to protect yourselfand property,'' said Laureen Chernow, a spokeswoman for thegovernor's division of emergency management.   One is to know the difference between the tornado watches andtornado warnings issued by the weather service.   A watch means weather conditions are suitable for development ofa tornado, and people should keep a careful lookout for potentialfunnel clouds.   A tornado warning means one has already developed and has beenspotted. Take cover immediately and don't go outside, but if youare in a car or mobile home you will be safer taking cover in thenearest ditch or depression.   At home, the best place to stay is a basement or undergroundstorm shelter. If no such shelter is available, go inside a closetin the center of the house or bathroom or lie flat under a heavytable.   McIntyre noted that most fatalities in a tornado are from flyingdebris, so ``we tell people to squat down, cover their heads andpresent a low profile.''   James R. McDonald, director of the Institute for DisasterResearch at Texas Tech University, says many people mistakenly tryto outrun tornadoes in their cars.   During the 1979 Wichita Falls tornado that killed 53, McDonaldsaid, ``people jumped in their cars and drove down Main Street at90 mph.'' Twenty-six people died while trying to outrun the twister.   Another misconception is about opening windows. It was oncebelieved that windows needed to be open to equalize air pressurebetween the storm and the inside of a house to prevent the housefrom exploding.   McIntyre said there are enough natural openings in a house toequalize air pressure, and ``if that tornado wants to open yourwindows, it'll do that for you.''</TEXT></DOC>
