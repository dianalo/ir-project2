(EBE) was granted a right-of-way for a mine access road across Federallands to access the Sheep Creek Portal of the inactive Alaska-Juneau (A-J)Mine (a historic gold mine) located on patented mining lands near Juneau,Alaska. After three years of exploration and study EBE, on March 1, 1989,applied for a right-of-way on Federal lands and State of Alaska selectedlands to allow for construction and operation of facilities to access andreopen the A-J Mine and construction and operation of a 345 feet high by675 feet long dam across Sheep Creek for tailings disposal and a 4.9 MWhydroelectric power plant. Adits of approximately 11,000 feet in length and underground milling facilitiesabout 2.5 miles south of Juneau will be constructed on lands selected bythe State of Alaska and currently on the priority list for conveyance tothe State. These lands should be conveyed to the State prior to the beginningof mine development. The dam, the tailings impoundment area, a 5,200 footlong penstock, and a new access road to the Sheep Creek Portal will belocated on Federal lands withdrawn under a powersite classification. Other development facilities will be constructed and operated on landsowned by the City and Borough of Juneau and the Alaska Electric Light andPower Company. Alternative tailings disposal sites proposed by EBE arelocated on lands administered by the Juneau Ranger District, U.S. ForestService (USFS) of the Tongass National Forest. The A-J Mine Project will process 22,500 tons per day of low grade (0.047oz/ton gold) ore and 1,000 tons per day of waste rock. Total mine tailingsare estimated to be 100,000,000 tons. The capital cost of the project isapproximately $170,000,000. The mine will employ a workforce of 450 peoplefor about 13 years of mining. Processing of the ore will consist of a varietyof mechanical processes for about 96 percent of the ore with the remainingfour percent going through a cyanide leaching process. On March 13, 1989, EBE filed an application with the Alaska District, U.S.Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) for facilities of the project which aresubject to permits under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. EBE also must file applications with the Environmental Protection Agency(EPA) for National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permitsand with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for a PowersiteLicense. In addition to Federal permits, EBE intends to file a right-of-way applicationwith the State of Alaska to use State ownerships. In accordance with section 102(2)(c) of the National Environmental PolicyAct, the BLM has identified the need to prepare an Environmental ImpactStatement (EIS). In accordance with 40 CFR 1506.5 BLM will assume leadand act as the Federal focal point. In accordance with 40 CFR 1506.2 theBLM, the Corps, the EPA, the USFS and the FERC are preparing a coordinatedpublic involvement and decision process to reduce to the fullest extentpossible duplication of effort. All interested parties are invited to participate in the scoping processwhich will: 1. Determine the scope and significant issues to be analyzed in depth inthe EIS. 2. Eliminate insignificant issues, concerns and opportunities. 3. Determine whether significant issues, concerns and opportunities areaddressed in depth prior to the Department of the Interior grant of right-of-way.Specific issues may involve the following questions: What actions are necessary to protect subsistence resources? What actions are necessary to protect fish and wildlife? What actions are necessary to protect recreational opportunities? What actions are necessary to protect or minimize impacts to wetlands,waterbodies, streams, and the marine environment? What significant social and economic impacts need to be considered? What are the cumulative impacts of several ongoing or planned large scalemining projects in the region near Juneau? In accordance with 40 CFR 1501.6 the following agencies have been requestedto participate in the EIS process by BLM: <ITAG tagnum="15">State of Alaska </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Department of the Interior_Fish and Wildlife Service </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Environmental Protection Agency </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Department of Agriculture_Forest Service </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Department of Commerce_National Marine Fisheries Service </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Department of the Army_Corps of Engineers </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Federal Energy Regulatory Commission </ITAG>The EIS will be prepared under third party contract by James M. MontgomeryConsulting Engineers. A draft EIS is expected to be available for publicreview and comment in the summer of 1989 with the final EIS completed inthe winter of 1989-90. Echo Bay Exploration proposes to begin constructionin June of 1990. <ITAG tagnum="6">John F.
