The code will help students ``grow up to be socialist successorsmore rapidly,'' said Education Commission official Zhang Renxian.   The official Xinhua News Agency, which carried the remarks byZhang, did not provide details of the code, but said it demandsthat students ``defend the interests of the motherland, abide bythe constitution, adhere to socialist collectivism and love labor.''   It also takes up moral behavior, maintaining public order and``abiding by the discipline of foreign affairs.''   The government says that inadequate attention to mental andphysical discipline and political education led to the springpro-democracy student movement that was ended by a bloody militarycrackdown on what authorities say was a counterrevolutionaryrebellion.   Since June, all university students have been required to attendclasses on party doctrine and ideology.   There also has been a renewed stress on physical labor, aneducational practice largely abandoned in the past decade.</TEXT></DOC>
