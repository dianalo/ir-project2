The Safe Energy Communication Council said the nuclear industrywas misleading the public by billing the advanced-design reactors asa partial solution to global atmospheric warming caused by emissionsfrom fossil fuel plants.   ``Nuclear power offers a `fools gold' solution to globalwarming,'' said Scott Denman, the group's director.   Alex Antypas, a researcher at the council, said it's too early totell whether new reactor designs will prove better and more economicthan the current generation.   ``It will take at least 10 years to develop and build a singledemonstration plant, and another two or more decades to bring manyof those plants on line,'' Antypas said.   The proposed new reactors would rely heavily on ``passive''design features to guard against a melting of the reactor core. Agas-cooled reactor, for example, uses helium as a coolant instead ofwater and its core is encased in graphite. This gives its operatorsmore time to respond to problems because the gas cannot boil awayand the graphite takes hours to reach a dangerous temperature.   Antypas said that even if the advanced-design reactors prove moresafe and reliable than the current light-water reactors, theindustry still will not have solved the problem of long-termdisposal of wastes generated by the plants.   The group said more emphasis should be placed on improving energyefficiency in transportation, buildings, appliances and utilitiesinstead of spending billions on new nuclear plants.   Many in the nuclear industry believe that widespread adoption ofthe new reactor technologies is vital to restoring public confidencein the safety and efficiency of nuclear power.</TEXT></DOC>
