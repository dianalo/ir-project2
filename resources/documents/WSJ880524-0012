In markets thinned by the Whit Monday holiday in Europe and by many traders attending a foreign-exchange convention in Hawaii, the dollar was pushed lower in New York as participants bought yen and shed dollar positions assumed after the announcement last Tuesday that the U.S. trade deficit narrowed sharply in March.    Late in the New York day, the dollar was quoted at 124.56 yen, down from 124.83 yen, and at 1.7008 marks, from 1.7023 marks.    In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the dollar opened at 124.43 yen.    Traders said yen buying Monday led the way for other currencies as the dollar briefly dipped below 1.7000 marks and 124.50 yen, perceived as important psychological support levels for the U.S. currency.    Traders said the dollar's weakness isn't tied to a specific event, but to market skepticism about its potential to climb.    Despite last week's news that U.S. consumer prices rose at a moderate rate of 0.4% in April, some traders say fears of inflation, or an outbreak of real inflation, will keep the dollar from rising for the next few months.    International Monetary Fund Managing Director Michel Camdessus, speaking in Australia yesterday, said there is a risk of inflation in industrial nations as world prices for primary commodities increase and as the U.S. economy operates at close to full capacity.    Last Tuesday, it was reported that U.S. factories, utilities, and mines operated at a seasonally adjusted 82.7% of capacity in April, the highest level since March 1980.    Traders are awaiting more data to judge whether the U.S. economy is growing at an inflationary pace. Data on U.S. durable goods orders for April will be released today. The first revision of the U.S. Gross National Product for the first quarter will be released Thursday. Preliminary data showed the economy grew at a 2.3% annualized rate for the first quarter.    On New York's Commodity Exchange, current-delivery gold rose $4.10 an ounce, to $462.20, in moderate trading. The estimated volume was 4.3 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $459.75 an ounce in early trading Tuesday in Hong Kong.    ---                    LATE NEW YORK TRADING                     Monday, May 23, 1988    Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
