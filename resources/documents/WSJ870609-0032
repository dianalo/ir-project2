Now he washes dishesand daydreams about how he used to take his daughter tokindergarten, before he became inmate No. 06231-054 at theminimum-security federal prison camp here.   At a time when the apprehension of white-collar criminals has become a media staple, Mr. Orchard's life is an illustration of what happens at the other end of the legal process. A slight, balding man with owlish glasses, he has been here at Eglin for two years on a pair of tax-fraud convictions and hopes to be released to a halfway house this fall. As he tells it, life in any prison is bad.    &quot;It's a place of confinement that keeps you away from your family,&quot; he says, rejecting as &quot;an illusion&quot; the country-club image of such low-security facilities as Eglin, which is tucked into a corner of this sprawling military base in the Florida panhandle.    Indeed, most white-collar criminals learn quickly that, even without the harsh conditions that characterize many higher-security institutions, prison means drudgery and boredom, a lack of privacy and simple liberties, and painful separation from loved ones.    Although white-collar criminals can be sent anywhere in the nation's prison system, they most often serve their time in one of the 21 minimum-security institutions. Eglin's nearly 800 inmates, for example, are all serving time for nonviolent crimes. White-collar criminals make up the second-largest prisoner group here, after those in for drug-related crimes.    Clearly, prison life could be a lot worse than it is in such places. Mr. Orchard wakes each morning at 4:30 -- an hour before most of the other inmates -- and by 5 he is at his job, washing pots and pans in the kitchen. After he gets off work at 10:30, his time is generally his own. He plays tennis two or three times a week and spends a lot of time in the prison law library, working on his case.    He says that the food here is &quot;better than good&quot; and that the people are &quot;very courteous to each other.&quot; The camp itself looks like a well-maintained college campus, with bungalow-like dormitories, four tennis courts and manicured grounds. It doesn't have fences, and only a white line painted on the roadway marks the border of freedom.    Nonetheless, it is prison. And to Mr. Orchard and most other white-collar convicts, that's all that matters.    &quot;The worst thing is you are confined,&quot; says Irwin Schiff, an author and self-styled tax rebel who recently began a three-year sentence for income-tax evasion at the minimum-security Federal Correctional Facility in Loretto, Pa. &quot;You can't see the people who are closest to you. You can't travel. You are told what to do.&quot;    As part of the routine at Eglin, for example, inmates are regularly counted -- five times every 24 hours and seven times on Saturdays and Sundays. They must wear prison blues. Their phone calls and mail are monitored. They're prohibited from carrying on business from the prison. There's little privacy, and the conditions are crowded: Most inmates double up in the dormitories' sleeping cubicles, with two men sharing the roughly 7-foot-by-8-foot cubicles intended for one.    Every aspect of an inmate's life is meticulously regulated. Eglin's 60-page prison handbook says &quot;contact&quot; with wives or girlfriends during weekend visiting times is limited to &quot;hand holding and having one's arm around the other's waist, upper back or shoulder.&quot; Spending money is also restricted. Inmates can't walk around with more than $1 in coins (for vending machines) or spend more than $95 a month in the prison commissary.    &quot;The first week I was incarcerated was the worst week in my life,&quot; says Lewie Tidwell, a former president of Eglin National Bank in Fort Walton Beach, Fla. Mr. Tidwell spent nine months at Eglin after a 1979 conviction for misapplication of bank funds.    Others concur. &quot;You get through one day, and that's one day; you get through one week, and that's another week,&quot; says Jon Perroton, currently serving a 20-year sentence at the medium-security Tucson, Ariz., Federal Correctional Institution for defrauding Hibernia Bank of San Francisco of $23 million.    Mr. Perroton, who shares a two-man cell with a bank robber, can't be released until at least 1995. For now, he works as a clerk in the prison's food service and fights boredom by reading and taking classes in water management. He also fights off homosexual advances, which he says are quite common but &quot;not my game.&quot; Mostly, Mr. Perroton says, he keeps to himself, since &quot;the slightest wrong word can set someone off.&quot;    Like most prisoners, Mr. Perroton says his biggest frustration is family problems -- in his case, an inability to communicate with his children. He says his wife divorced him when he entered prison and now won't accept his collect calls (the only kind prisoners can make). &quot;The only communication is by letter,&quot; he explains.&quot;And since the kids are four and eight, the letters are not very earthshaking.&quot;    Lawrence Austin, by contrast, talks regularly with his family, but he says that hardly suffices. An inmate at the medium-security Federal Correctional Institute in Ray Brook, N.Y., he says that his family is seeing a counselor. &quot;It is destroying my children,&quot; asserts Mr. Austin, who is serving concurrent eight-year sentences for a $1 million check-kiting scheme and for defrauding Fort Lauderdale investors of some $4 million.    Boredom is another major complaint. &quot;After six months in prison, you start to vegetate,&quot; says William Irwin, a 53-year-old inmate at Miami's Metropolitan Correctional Center who is now in the second year of a 62-year sentence for masterminding a big tax-shelter fraud. &quot;To go to the parole board becomes the big event.&quot;    In his ample spare time, Mr. Irwin has become a jailhouse lawyer, working on his own case and on those of other inmates. He says he is confident he will win his freedom, after which he hopes to go to law school.    Barry Nelson, a former mortgage-company vice president who is serving a four-year racketeering sentence at Ray Brook and appealing a concurrent 25-year one, says he is fighting boredom by writing a first novel. So far, he notes, he has completed about 400 pages of &quot;sex, violence, money laundering -- what sells today.&quot;    Then there's David Crabtree, who might welcome a little more boredom. Since being imprisoned in 1984 for bankruptcy fraud, he has been shuffled through six federal prisons and a number of county jails. Mr. Crabtree claims that prosecutors are moving him around to pressure him to cooperate in other cases. Prosecutors deny this and counter that his travels mainly reflect the fact he is testifying in trials in different cities.    Mr. Crabtree notes that his favorite stopover was at Eglin, which he says is &quot;like night and day&quot; compared with some of the higher-security prisons to which he was sent. At such places, he says, a climate of violence affects &quot;everything you do.&quot;    What is it about Eglin in particular that he likes? &quot;It's the class of people you have there,&quot; he says. </TEXT></DOC>
