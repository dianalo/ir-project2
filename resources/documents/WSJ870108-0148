An NZI official in London, special projects manager David Tickett, said an NZI unit during the past three months of 1986 accumulated 4.9% of Hill Samuel's 90 million shares outstanding, but he declined to comment on NZI's purpose in acquiring the stake. Mr. Brierley, who has mounted a number of takeover bids in Britain and the U.S. recently, holds a 19% stake in NZI.    ISTITUTO BANCARIO SAN PAOLO DI TORINO, Italy's second-biggest bank in terms of cash flow, sold its 8.92% stake in NUOVO BANCO AMBROSIANO for the equivalent of $113.5 million. The stake was purchased by CREDIOP, a state-controlled credit institution based in Rome. The profit for San Paolo is expected to be large in terms of the transaction price -- about $85.1 million -- because it purchased its shares in 1982 in what was then called Banco Ambrosiano after the Milan bank's collapse. Since then, however, the Milan bank has returned to financial health.    PEUGEOT S.A., a French auto maker, said it plans to pay its first dividend since 1981 this year. The plan illustrates Peugeot's return to profitability after losses between 1980 and 1984 that totaled more than the equivalent of $1.2 billion. Industry analysts expect Peugeot to post earnings of about $312 million for 1986, up from $85 million in 1985.    TOSHIBA CORP., a Japanese electronics company, said it agreed to provide China with the technology to produce large-scale integration chips for color televisions. The manufacturing technology for the chips, which control television signals and images, will be transferred to China National Electronics Import andamp; Export Corp. as soon as Toshiba gets approval from Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry. </TEXT></DOC>
