<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-43-0828 </DOCNO><TEXT>In addition to interacting in the detector, particles produced at an interactionregion also deposit energy, with less desirable consequences, in magnetsand other components of the accelerator. This note briefly assesses thedamage potential of these (essentially unavoidable) beam losses fromthe viewpoint of quenching of superconducting magnets in an upgradedTevatron, specifically for the 1 TeV p-{ovr_string}p option with a luminosityof 10{sup 31} cm/sup - 2/ sec{sup -1}, through the results carry moregenerality. Related issues such as radiation damage to detector electronicsor other components are not addressed here. These are thought to be lessproblematic at the Tevatron, as in thus far supported by operationalexperience. 8 refs., 10 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
