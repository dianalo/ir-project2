As of this writing its apparentmagnitude in visible light is m=3.0 (the human eye can see up to m=5or 6). It is located in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), our nearestneighbor galaxy at a distance of 50 000 kpc (1 pc {approx} 3 light years{approx} 3 X 10/sup 18/cm). Its present brightness in the visible rangeis more than 100 million times that of the sun. The supernova is expectedto produce emission over essentially the entire electromagnetic spectrum.Thus far it has been detected in the radio, IR, visible, and UV bands.X-rays and gamma-rays, although not yet detected, are expected to eventuallybe seen and to contain some of the most exciting new information on thisphenomenon. This note deals with the planned NASA observations in thesehigh-energy wavelength bands and their scientific importance.</TEXT></DOC>
