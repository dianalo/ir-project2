Normally,banking facilities shall be used only at overseas locations and in statesthat prohibit branch banking.

The following guidelines govern application of 32 CFR Part 286ato those financial institutions that operate under this part.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. Financial institutions and their branches and facilities operatingon DoD military installations do not fall within the purview of 12 U.S.C.1751 et seq.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. These financial institutions do not fit the definition of ``agency''to which the Privacy Act applies: ``. . . any executive department, MilitaryDepartment, Government corporation, Government-controlled corporation,or other establishment in the executive branch of the Government (includingthe Executive Office of the President), or an independent regulatory agency''(5 U.S.C. 552(e) and 552a(a)(1)).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Nor are they ``government contractors'' within the meaning of 5U.S.C. 552a(m) as they do not operate a system of records on behalf ofan agency ``. . . to accomplish an agency function.'' According to theOffice of Management and Budget Privacy Act Guidelines, the provision relatingto Government contractors applies only to systems of records ``. . . actuallytaking the place of a Federal system which, but for the contract, wouldhave been performed by an agency and covered by the Privacy Act.'' Clearly,the subject institutions do not meet these criteria.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. Since the Act does not apply to them, these financial institutionsare not required to comply with the provision of 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(3) inobtaining and making use of personal information in their relationshipswith personnel authorized to use such institutions. Thus, these institutionsare not required to inform individuals from whom information is requestedof the authority for its solicitation, the principal purpose for whichit is intended to be used, the routine uses that may be made of it, orthe effects of not providing the information. There also is no requirementto post information of this nature within onbase banking and credit unionoffices.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The financial institutions concerned hold the same position andrelationship to their accountholders and members and to the Governmentas they did before enactment. Within their usual business relationships,they still are responsible for safeguarding the information provided bytheir accountholders or members and for obtaining only such informationas is reasonable and necessary to conduct business. This includes creditinformation and proper identification, which may include social securitynumber, as a precondition for the cashing of checks.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. Financial institutions may incorporate the following conditionsof disclosure of personal identification in all contracts, including loanagreements, account signature cards, certificates of deposit agreements,and any other agreements signed by their accountholders or members:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">I hereby authorize the Department of Defense and its various Departmentsand Commands to verify my social security number or other identifier anddisclose my home address to authorized (name of financial institution)officials so that they may contact me in connection with my business with(name of financial institution). All information furnished will be usedsolely in connection with my financial relationship with (name of financialinstitution).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">When the financial institution presents such signed authorizations,the Military Commands or installations shall provide the appropriate information.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. Even though the agreement described in subsection A.3., above,has not been obtained, the Department of Defense may provide these financialinstitutions with salary information and, when pertinent, the length ortype of civilian or military appointment, consistent with the Privacy Actand Freedom of Information Act, 32 CFR Parts 286a and 285. Some examplesof personal information pertaining to DoD personnel that can normally bereleased without creating an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy arename, rank, date of rank, salary, present and past duty assignments, futureassignments that have been finalized, office phone number, source of commission,and promotion sequence number.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. When DoD personnel with financial obligations are reassigned andfail to inform the financial institution of their whereabouts, they shouldbe located by contacting the individual's last known commander or supervisorat the official position or duty station within that particular DoD Component.That commander or supervisor shall either furnish the individual's newofficial duty location address to the financial institution, or shall forward,through official channels, any correspondence received pertaining theretoto the individual's new commander or supervisor for appropriate assistanceand response. Correspondence addressed to the individual concerned at hisor her last official place of business or duty station shall be forwardedas provided by postal regulations to the new location, but the individualmay choose not to respond. However, once an individual's affiliation withthe Department of Defense is terminated through separation or retirement,the locator assistance the Department may render in the disclosure of homeaddress is severely curtailed unless the public interest dictates disclosureof the last known home address. The Department of Defense may, at its discretion,forward correspondence to the individual's last known home address. Theindividual may choose not to respond; and the Department may not act asan intermediary for private matters concerning former DoD personnel whoare no longer affiliated with it.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">B. Questions concerning this guidance should be forwarded throughchannels to the Deputy Comptroller (Management Systems) (DC(MS)), Officeof the Comptroller of the Department of Defense, The Pentagon, Washington,DC 20301-1100.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">L.M.
