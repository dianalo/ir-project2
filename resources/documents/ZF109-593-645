 (1)  At the ACMConference on The History of Personal Workstations, Doug Ross told of drawingon an oscilloscope screen by using his finger to move a spot of light in1954.andP;  Graphic software has been a bastion of direct manipulation since the1950s, and Douglas Englebart demonstrated direct manipulation of text tolarge audiences in the 1960s.andP;  The style of contemporary direct-manipulationinterfaces evolved largely from prototypes developed at the Xerox Palo AltoResearch Center (PARC) in the 1970s.andP;  The Xerox Star offered a commercial GUIin 1981 (see Figure 1), and several early GUIs, like VisiOn, TopView, andWindows version 1, failed on underpowered PCs.andP;  The Macintosh, introduced in1984, was a major commercial success.andM;Although GUIs have been used for years, the hardware to support them isexpensive, so the vast majority of personal computer users still controltheir software by typing commands.andP;  With the introduction of Windows Version3, Microsoft hopes to move DOS users away from their command-line interfaceto a direct-manipulation interface.andP;  Let us take a quick look at Windows,then compare it to DOS and the Mac.andM;Windows 3andM;Windows was announced on May 22 1990, but beta copies had been circulatingfor months prior to the announcement.andP;  Microsoft stated that the $10 millionthey spent on the multicity, multimedia rollout and advertising campaign wasan industry record.andP;  I must admit that the hype worked its magic on me.andP;  Italso worked on Wall Street and with potential customers.andP;  Between April 25and May 22, Microsoft stock rose from 55-5/8 to 78-3/4, gaining over 40percent, and Jeffrey Tartar, publisher of Softletter, a software industrynewsletter, predicts sales of as many as six to nine million copies ofWindows during its first year.andP;  (2)andM;The most visible part of Windows is the user interface.andP;  Figure 2 shows anapplication window.andP;  The scrollbars, menu bar, and other widgets arevariations on a now familiar theme.andP;  If you have been using a Mac, GEM, OpenLook, NeXT, or other similar systems, you will be able to use Windows'application interface with little or no reference to the manual.andM;Windows users will enjoy the interface uniformity the Mac is known for.andP;  Forexample, the File menu shown in Figure 2 would be similar in allapplications, and located on the left, and a familiar Edit menu should benext to it.andP;  The Help menu should always be at the end of the menu bar, andit evokes a standard search and browse system, which if used well bydevelopers, will be a significant addition to applications.andM;Most interaction with the operating system, as opposed to an application, isthrough the Program Manager, the File Manager, and the Task List.andP;  Let uslook briefly at each of these.andM;The Program Manager in Figure 3 contains application groups, represented asicons within the Program Manager window.andP;  A group contains icons for one ormore programs and data files.andP;  A typical group would contain icons for thefiles and programs used in a given project or activity.andP;  A group icon opensinto a window when it is double clicked, and programs may be launched bydouble clicking their icons or the icons of files they created (assuming thatthe proper links have been established).andP;  Applications and files can be movedor copied from group to group by dragging their icons; however, they may notbe nested--a group cannot contain another group.andP;  When a program is active,but not being interacted with, it can be minimized to an icon on the desktop.andO;The two icons below the Program Manager window in Figure 3 represent suchprograms.andM;The File Manager is shown in Figure 4.andP;  It is typical of the tree-structuredfile browsers found in DOS 4.0 and many commercial and public domain utilityprograms.andP;  Most of the standard DOS file manipulation commands such as copyand erase are available by direct manipulation, and there are some new onces,for example move.andP;  The most glaring omission is the type command, whichdisplays the contents of a file.andP;  To view the contents of a file, you mustexecute Note-pad, one of the application programs bundled with Windows.andM;Applications can be launched from within File Manager as well as ProgramManager.andP;  You can launch an application by double clicking on its icon, or ifthe proper links have been established, by double clicking on a file createdby the application.andP;  You can also drag the icon for a data file to the iconfor a program, thereby launching the program with the file name in thecommand line.andP;  Given the ability to launch programs from File Manager,experienced users may prefer to make it, not Program Manager, their primaryinterface.andP;  Windows can be initialized to open either File or Program Manageras the first program the user sees.andM;I miss the DOS type command.andP;  I suspect that people who use other DOSbrowsers will also find a favored feature or two missing.andP;  Personally, I donot like the tree style of this and similar browsers.andP;  It is cramped anddifficult to read quickly.andP;  I prefer the rectangular table format found onthe NeXT.andP;  Perhaps that and other alternatives were evaluated and foundunsuitable for a small screen.andM;On the other hand, I like the Task List as shown in Figure 5.andP;  Windows doesmultitasking, and the Task List is used to switch and terminate tasks, aswell as to quickly arrange a cluttered screen.andP;  The Task List is evoked witha keystroke, menu selection, or by double clicking on a blank space on thedesktop.andP;  Once it is displayed, a quick mouse gesture is all that is neededto issue a command.andM;There are two other system control programs, the Print Manager for managingprint tasks and the Control Panel for changing the system configuration.andM;Windows also comes with several application programs including a nice colorpaint program, a simple word processor, and a communication and terminalemulation program.andP;  Perhaps most important, is the inclusion of the run-timemodule for Asymetrix' ToolBook with every copy of Windows.andP;  ToolBook issimilar in intent to Apple's HyperCard, and Windows users will be able toexecute, though not develop, ToolBook applications.andP;  All things considered,Windows comes with a significantly greater amount of application softwarethan the original Mac did.andM;Microsoft has also paid attention to aesthetics.andP;  The user interface isvisually appealing and colorful.andP;  Buttons and scroll bars have a subtlethree-dimensional look; proportional fonts are used in labels and menus; andthe display has an overall restful, velvety appearance.andP;  User interface speedis acceptable even on a relatively slow, 386-SX--based computer.andM;While the user interface is most noticeable, memory management is probablyWindows' most improtant feature.andP;  There are three Windows modes: real,standard, and 386-enhanced.andP;  Real mode is designed for PC-XTs and ATs withonly 640KB memory.andP;  In practice, I doubt that many of these machines willever run Windows, but it enables Microsoft to say there are tens of millionsof potential Windows machines in use.andM;Standard mode will run on at AT with 1 MB or more memory.andP;  It uses protectedmode and can utilize extended memory (above 640K).andP;  While other programs havedone the same, Windows is more impor tant because it is an overnight defactostandard.andP;  In standard mode you can multitask Windows applications, but notDOS applications.andP;  In practice, given the performance characteristics ofWindows (as I will discuss later) and limitation on multitasking, I doubtthat many standard-mode computers will use Windows--except to run specificapplications.andM;The mainstream Windows market is 386-based computers, which will run Windowsin 386-enhanced mode.andP;  This means that they can multitask Windows and DOSapplications, provide virtual memory, and run at a reasonable speed, althoughDOS programs that use expanded memory will no longer work.andP;  Thus, therealistic minimum Windows configuration is a 386-SX, a VGA display, a mouse,a hard disk, and 2-4MB of memory.andP;  According to Dataquest, a market researchfirm, there are approximately six million such machines in the world, roughlyhalf of which are in the United States.andM;Finally, there is a complex but uniform application program interface fardevelopers, and Microsoft is committed to making it possible to port Windowsapplications to OS/2 without rewriting.andP;  Users and developers will alsobenefit enormously by having printer and display device drivers become partof the operating system.andM;Windows Versus DOSandM;When Windows first appeared.andP;  I expected to make it my primary PC operatingenvironment.andP;  It sounded as though there was nothing to lose.andP;  I couldcontinue using my old DOS programs under Windows while gaining multitasking,cut-and-paste between applications, virtual memory, and an attractive GUI.andO;Having used Windows for some time, I must confess now that I am still usingDOS.andP;  Let me give you some of my reasons.andM;As the benchmarks in Table I show, programs run slower under Windows than inDOS.andP;  Under Windows, (in 386-extended mode) DOS programs either run fullscreen or in a window.andP;  The performance degradation in full-screen mode isnot as bad as within a window; however, the ability to cut and pasteinformation between applications is lost.andP;  The user decides the default modefor an application, and after it is running, he or she can quickly switchmodes by typing ALT-Enter.andM;There are still bugs in Windows.andP;  For example, in working with Windows Imanaged to generate error messages like &quot;UNRECOVERABLE APPLICATION ERROR,terminating current application&quot; and &quot;This application has violated systemintegrity and will be terminated; close all applications, exit Windows, andreboot your computer.&quot;andP;  I even found a way to cause Windows to abortexecution and return control immediately to DOS, and after reading electronicbulletin boards I hear of other bugs.andM;In addition to inconvenience, these bugs can corrupt Windows files.andP;  Windowsmaintains files for recording the state of the ProgramandM;Manager, or program groups.andP;   WhenandM;one of these files is corrupted, a Windows guru is needed to rebuild it.andP;  TheWindows files would also be susceptible to hardware failure.andP;  If I usedWindows regularly, I would consider using a batch file to back up the Windowsfiles before each session.andM;When running in a window, the font used for character-oriented DOS programslike WordStar or Lotus 1-2-3 is difficult to read, and in text the cursor isdifficult to find.andP;  A utility program to expand the cursor would be adefinite plus.andP;  Furthermore, even if an application window is extended tofull size, the scroll bars and title bar mean that some characters aretruncated.andM;I am also accustomed to various DOS utility programs, including Norton'sChange Directory and a public domain directory browser.andP;  File Managercommands do not do everything my handy utilities do.andP;  For example, my browsercan display the contents of an ASCII or WordStar file with a singlekeystroke.andP;  Missing utility functions would be even more of a problem for apower user who used more sophisticated utilities or an operating environmentlike DESQview[TM] or an expanded memory manager.andM;I could still use my favorite utilities by temporarily switching to DOS usingWindows' DOS command.andP;  The context switch takes 2.9 seconds to enter DOS and2.0 seconds to return to Windows on a 16MHz, 386-SX computer, but that is notthe main problem.andP;  Changes made while in DOS can corrupt the Windows filesystem.andP;  Escaping to DOS without exiting Windows is an invitation todisaster.andM;My transition to Windows will be gradual.andP;  I will use DOS, switching toWindows only when I want to use a Windows application.andP;  As more Windowsapplications are written, I will switchmore often.andP;  Many developers areworking on Windows applications, and they will be better than DOSapplications because of Windows' graphic scren model, mouse, user interface,and large memory space.andP;  The application-quality gap between DOS and Windowswill become greater after the release of the next version of Windows.andP;  Thenext release will have significant multimedia extensions, including run-timecompatibility with MacroMind's Director and Farallon's sound files, andoutline fonts on the screen.andM;Some of the bugs I complained of will also disappear with the next release,and performance may improve.andP;  Still, the more I use Windows and Windowsapplications, the more I will want a fast machine.andP;  While a 386-SX allows theuser to tap all of Windows' features, all but the most patient andimpoverished users will want the speed of a full 32-bit 386 with a lot ofmemory.andP;  That should make IBM happy.andM;Windows Versus the MacandM;Will Mac users flock to Windows?andP;  Will developers desert the Mac for Windows?andO;Is Windows just a weak imitation of the Mac?andM;I tested three application programs that run on the Mac and under Windows:Microsoft's word processor, Word, their spreadsheet, Excel, and their slidepresentation package, PowerPoint.andP;  I ran the programs on a Mac IIcx with 4MBof memory and on three PC compatibles, a 16MHz AST 386-SX with 4MB of memory,a 20MHz PS/2 with 6MB of memory, and a PC clone with a 25MHz 386 and 4MB ofmemory.andP;  If you have the Norton Utility benchmark program, you can comparethese computers to yours by using Table II.andP;  The speed indices shown thereare relative to a standard IBM PC-XT, so high numbers are good.andP;  As you see,the clone was the quickest internally, but the AST machine had a faster diskthan the others.andM;Table III compares the speed of the Mac and the PC compatibles.andP;  As you see,the results are mixed.andP;  Disk operations are generally faster on the Mac(these PCs had generally slow disks), but internal computing is fastest onthe high-speed PCs.andP;  Screen I/O was also faster on the fast PCs, except inthe case of PowerPoint.andM;PowerPoint was used to test performance with large graphic objects.andP;  I spokewith a PowerPoint developer at Microsoft who stated that the graphicalgorithms used in the Mac and Windows versions were nearly identical.andP;  Sheauributed the speed differences to relatively high overhead on Windows'graphic primitive calls and the segmented memory-addressing scheme on theIntel CPUs used in Windows machines.andP;  The flat address space of the MotorolaCPUs used in the Mac makes it more efficient when operating on graphicobjects larger than Intel's 64K segment size.andP;  (This is not a limitation ofthe Intel 386 CPU, but is caused by the need to be backward compatible withthe 286 and the 808X.)andP;  The quality of device drivers for your display willalso affect graphic performance, though in this case all three PCs usedstandard VGA displays.andP;  Applications that use many different fonts will alsoprobably be faster on a Mac.andM;One should note that this test was designed to compare Mac and Windowsperformance with graphics, not to evaluate PowerPoint.andP;  PowerPoint cachesscreens once they are computed, and redisplaying them is much faster.andM;These benchmark times are consistent with my subjective impression--the Macwas noticeably faster than the ST machine, but internal and screen I/Ooperations on the 25MHz clone were the fastest.andP;  Benchmarks, however, must betaken with a grain of salt, and these are more suspicious than most becausethey may reflect differences in the quality of the implementation of the Macand Windows versions of the programs.andP;  If anything, the Mac may have anadvantage because the programs have been around longer.andP;  The implementations,however, are functionally close, and users will be able to move their skillsand data files between them without a glitch.andM;The applications I tested are available on both machines, but for now thereare many more applications for the Mac than Windows.andP;  The gap is narrowing.andO;Hundreds of developers are working on Windows products and others, likeAsymetrix, are working on tools to simplify end-user programming.andP;  EvenApple's in-house software company, Claris, is rumored to be developing forWindows.andM;A year from now it will be interesting to compare the quality of software oboth platforms.andP;  Will Windows inspire new software; will Mac developers portversions of their current software or redesign for Windows; will Macapplications remain one generation ahead?andP;  These questions will be answeredwhen we have the multimedia version of Windows and Version 7 of the Macoperating system with multitasking, outline fonts on the screen,interapplication communication, stereo sound, NTSC video output (at somepoint), virtual memory, and database access.andP;  When we see the applicationsfor those environments, we will know how the development community hasreacted to the two platforms.andP;  Apple is committed to shipping System 7 thisyear, and Microsoft has promised major upgrades to its current applicationsand two new products at that time.andM;Going beyond speed and software availability, is the user interface.andP;  As longas you are running an application within a window like Figure 2, the Windowsuser interface is as good or better than the Mac.andP;  When dealing with thesystem, however, the Mac is superior.andP;  It will remain so unless Apple'sforthcoming System 7 is extremely complicated.andM;The major drawback to the system portion of the Windows interface is theconceptual separation of the File and Program Managers.andP;  The Mac presents auniform desktop with file icons inside folders and nested subfoldersrepresenting directories.andP;  Programs and data files exist side by side in thefolders, and they can be launched by double-clicking either one.andP;  Windows canoverlap arbitrarily, and files can be copied and moved anywhere by draggingthem.andP;  The interface is conceptually simple and easily learned by beginners.andM;By contrast, because it was retrofitted (kludged) to DOS, Windows separatesthe Program and File Managers as shown in Figure 6.andP;  Both may runsimultaneously, but they are conceptually separate.andP;  You cannot drag filesfrom one to the other, and there is no correspondence between the location ofa file in the File Manager and its location in the Program Manager.andM;A related problem is the difficulty of associating a data file with theprogram that created it.andP;  The user must either make the associationexplicitly, which is cumbersome and requires knowledge of DOS, or a defaultmay be set up associating all data files with a specified 3-character nameextension with a program.andP;  The latter means that the extension can no longerbe used to qualify the file name, a severe restriction since DOS file namesare limited to 8-characters.andP;  Future Windows applications may keep track ofthe files they have created (as does Microsoft Word), but that is a limitedsolution.andM;For example, if I wrote my Communications columns on a Mac, I would create afolder called &quot;Communications Columns&quot; that would contain the documents I wasworking on.andP;  When I was ready to edit a column, I would double click its iconto launch the application and load the document.andP;  To create a backup copy, Iwould drag the document icon to a floppy disk icon.andP;  In DOS, I would switchto the directory containing the columns and evoke my word-processing program(assuming its directory had been initialized on the DOS path).andP;  To make abackup copy, I would enter a single command.andM;To do the same in Windows, I would have to establish a program group for thecolumns using the Program Manager.andP;  Then I would create an icon in the groupfor my column, explicitly specifying the command line and paths to theword-processing program and the document file.andP;  For backup, I would have tocreate a one-line batch file to issue the copy command and create a secondicon to find and execute that batch file.andM;These steps are not difficult, but they re cumbersome and require experiencewith DOS.andP;  What about beginners?andP;  A system manager could set up programgroups for turnkey applications and tell the users not to touch the FileManager, but then the users would be intimidated and not explore.andP;  Thealternative is to teach users about both DOS and Windows.andP;  How does thisaffect the ease of use claimed for Windows?andP;  The bottom line is that both theMac and DOS are conceptually clearer, mapping more directly onto theunderlying structure of the machine than Windows.andP;  That will make Windowsdifficult to learn and will make it more difficult for beginners to infer thestructure of the computer system.andM;There are many other small pros and cons in a comparison of the two userinterfaces.andP;  For example, the Mac's ability to make multiple selections bydragging the mouse is missing from Windows, and it is difficult to grab thecorner of a window to resize it.andP;  On the other hand, Windows' Task List ismore convenient than the Mac Multifinder interface, and the uniform Helpmechanism is a definite plus if developers use it well.andM;Another major difference is HyperCard on the Mac versus ToolBook for Windows.andO;Today, ToolBook is ahead of HyperCard in features, but HyperCard Version 2will be available soon.andP;  It will be faster than ToolBook and it will shiftthe feature balance.andP;  In the long run the two will probably be comparable inspeed and features, but their pricing strategies are different.andP;  Applebundles HyperCard with every Mac, so it has become an extremely popularend-user programming tool.andP;  A runtime version of ToolBook is bundled withWindows, but the developer's package retails for $395.00.andP;  I do not know howhigh a royalty Microsoft would have had to pay to bundle Tool-Book withWindows.andP;  It would have raised the cost, but it would have changed the roleof the program.andP;  Perhaps Microsoft plans other end-user programming tools.andO;(3)andM;Finally, we must compare system prices.andP;  A glance at the ads in the sportspage of the Los Angeles Times shows that a Mac IIcx sells for at least $1,000more than a 25MHz PC clone.andP;  As Windows applications proliferate and thesoftware matures, Apple will cut hardware prices and deliver Version 7 oftheir operating system.andP;  Like Windows, on a 286 based PC, Version 7 willtheoretically run on old, slow Macs with 2MB of memory, but in practice youwill probably want a fast Mac with memory management hardware and morememory.andM;Back to HistoryandM;Let me leave off where I began, with a review of a video tape on the historyof GUIs.andP;  University Video Communications produces video Communicationsproduces video tapes of lectures by distinguished computer scientists.andP;  Thetapes are directed toward upper division and graduate level computer sciencestudents.andP;  Their first Distinguished Lecturer Series features 15 tapes.andP;  Someof them have direct relevance to personal computing such as &quot;Page DescriptionLanguages&quot; by Brian Reid, &quot;Network Computing&quot; by David Nelson, and &quot;The OpenSystems Imperative&quot; by Bill Joy.andM;The tape closest to my heart, however, and the topic of this column, is AlanKay's &quot;Doing with Images Makes Symbols: Communicating with Computers.&quot;andP;  Kay'slecture describes the work his group did at Xerox PARC, where the userinterface concepts and widgets found in the Mac and Windows were invented.andO;It also describes the historical and theoritical influences on their work.andM;Kay discusses and shows video samples of the experimental Alto workstations,Smalltalk, and applications.andP;  One sees prototypes of many facest of theWindows and Mac user interfaces.andP;  He has also has assembled historicalfootage on important systems that preceded his work at PARC.andP;  There is filmof Ivan Sutherland's Sketchpad from the 1950s.andP;  Douglas Englesbart'sdemonstration of the NLS system at the 1968 Fall Joint Computer Conference,and GRAIL (Graphical Input Language), developed at Rand by Tom Ellis and hiscolleagues in the mid 1960s and shown in Figure 7.andP;  Sutherland's andEnglebart's work is now well known and recognized, but GRAIL is relativelyobscure.andP;  GRAIL allowed direct entry and editing of flowcharts using a pen(on a Rand Table) for input.andP;  It recognized printed handwriting, flowchartingsymbols, and gestures.andP;  Kay said he showed the GRAIL film to his group atPARC every three months so they would not forget what they were trying to do.andO;He was inspired by each of these systems, and in watching this tape you willsee why.andM;While speaking of theoretical influences, Kay began with studies of childrenby psychologists Jean Piaget and Jerome Bruner.andP;  (Kay headed the LearningResearch Group at PARC, and his users were children.)andP;  Their work led him toemphasize the use of kinesthetic and graphic skills in learning and creating,with symbolic processing used more for communication after the fact (hencethe title of the talk).andP;  A less conventional influence was Tim Galloway,author of &quot;The Inner Game of Tennis.&quot;andP;  Galloway uses tricks to distracttennis student's minds so they will not interfere with their body's abilityto hit the ball automatically.andP;  Similarly, Kay hoped that an interface withdirect manipulation and graphic objects would distract the symbolic part ofthe mind, leading to kinesthetic and graphic creativity.andP;  I think hesucceeded.andM;PointersandM;There are many books for Windows users and developers.andP;  I looked at severalbooks on Windows, and most added little, if anything, to the program manual.andO;My favorite was, Running Windows, by Craig Stinson and Nancy Andrews, whichadds value to the manual by giving many user hints and tips.andP;  It is publishedby Microsoft Press, which also publishes several books for Windowsdevelopers.andM;Doug Englebart's 1968 demonstration of NLS is shown on the video tapementioned in this column.andP;  That demonstration was inspirational and had wideinfluence.andP;  You can also read the paper behind the presentation: Douglas D.andO;C. Englebart and W. K. English, &quot;A Research Center For Augmenting HumanIntellect,&quot; Proceedings of the AFIPS Fall Joint Computer Conference, SanFrancisco, December, 1968, pp.andP;  395-410.andM;If you would like to read about GRAIL, RAND has several reports on thesystem, including a concise overview: T.
