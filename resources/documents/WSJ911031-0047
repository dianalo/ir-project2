At least that's what the political signspoint to so far. The 72-year-old Mr. Miyazawa would be acredit to any good old party machine, from Tokyo to Chicago.He enjoys a reputation as a smart, seasoned politician. Hisresume shows three decades of public service, includingstints as foreign minister and finance minister. He speaksfluent English and will no doubt prove a poised participantin future summits, starting with the visit to Japan late nextmonth by President Bush.   So what's the problem? Whatever the ruling LDP has beenfussing over in the back rooms these past four decades or so,hasn't Japan sped from post-World War II rubble to the frontranks of the world's developed nations? What's wrong withJapan's good-old-boy politics is that having reached thefront ranks of world development, Japan by now needspoliticians who will lead in directions that voters want thecountry to go. That means spelling out a clear agenda thatinvites public input before the decisions are made by thequiet and powerful Japanese bureaucracy, whose intereststhese days too often diverge from those of the averageJapanese voter.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Miyazawa should know. He was serving as financeminister under Prime Minister Takeshita when the LDP in 1988bulldozed a deeply unpopular 3% sales tax through the Diet.It was a tax desired by Mr. Miyazawa's finance ministry. Butthe ensuing public outrage turned into a national orgy ofousting politicians over seedy deals that in earlier daysmight have been ignored as routine.   We revive this bit of recent history in the hope that Mr.Miyazawa is prepared to ensure it is not repeated. Thatdoesn't mean he should suppress scandals, which have beenrolling steadily through Japan's financial markets this yearlike waves of a rising tide. It means that Japan is ripe fora leader who will speed up and smooth out the transition awayfrom feudal bureaucracy and LDP rice-farm politics.   What Japan needs most from Mr. Miyazawa is straightforwardguidance toward a system in which the chief asset in businessis not political clout, but efficiency in serving consumers.That means, simply put, a more open economy -- not only incar and radio exports, but also in farming and financialmarkets. This would make for happier Japanese voters, closerfriendships abroad and a richer world all around.   Mr. Miyazawa has named various vague projects, including aplan to spend more on infrastructure and his hope ofannouncing a &quot;Tokyo Declaration&quot; reaffirmingJapanese-American ties on the eve of the 50th anniversary ofPearl Harbor. There's nothing wrong with these aspirations.Many Japanese still live without access to modern sewers orgood roads, and there are solid reasons why the American andJapanese capitalist democracies should be firm friends andvigorous trading partners. But what Mr. Miyazawa omits so faris a clear plan to rapidly pare away restrictions that propup old, wasteful cartels, such as rice farming and insurance.   The sheer rising volume of market activity has beenshoving Japan toward modernization, with the statebureaucrats tagging reluctantly along. But to ensure thatJapan travels smoothly through the next lap of development,it would help for Mr. Miyazawa to set the pace.</TEXT></DOC>
