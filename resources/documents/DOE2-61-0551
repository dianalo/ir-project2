Greenpeace's bone of contention is the useof chlorine to achieve high brightness and to remove excess lignin inthe bleaching stage of the pulp process. Dioxin is formed in mechanicaland semi-mechanical pulp processes, papermaking processes, and in recoveryboilers. Chlorine bleaching compounds produce dangerous effluents whichcontain the most toxic form of dioxin, 2,3,7,8-trichloridibenzo-p-dioxin(2,3,7,8-TCDD), which can cause considerable damage to fish and bottomvegetation and represent health risks. A new oxygen-alkali delignificationprocess being used by as many as 35 mills around the world has been foundto reduce bleach chemical use and toxicity of bleach plants effluentsby at least 50% while increasing the pulp yield from five to 10%.</TEXT></DOC>
