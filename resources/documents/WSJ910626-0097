To reach the ambitious goal, Britain's maintelephone-service company said its 200-member U.S. salesforce is starting to sell video-conference systems that itclaims provide clearer pictures than competing models andwill appeal especially to clients wanting to set upinternational video-conferences. The equipment, designed byBritish Telecom, uses semiconductor chips made by MotorolaCorp.</LP><TEXT>   The sales campaign, unveiled during London and New Yorkmedia briefings linked by BT video-conference equipment, isthe latest in a series of splashy BT efforts to make a markoutside its home British base, where it runs about 95% of thecountry's telecommunications services. Its U.S. investmentsinclude the purchase of McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s Tymnetdata-communications network and a 20% stake in the biggestU.S. cellular-phone company, McCaw Cellular CommunicationsInc. So far, however, few of these investments have paid muchprofit.   British Telecom officials said the U.S. video-conferencemarket interests them because they expect it to boomfollowing the introduction this year of products conformingto an international technical standard. The U.S. equipmentmarket -- 1991 size estimates for which range from $200million to $420 million -- is currently dominated byPictureTel Corp. of Peabody, Mass., and Compression Labs Inc.of San Jose, Calif., each of which uses its own technicalstandard. That means a corporation using one video-conferencesystem can't easily tune in a partner or customer usinganother system.   British Telecom claims to be the first to market systemsusing a recently promulgated international standard calledH.261, and says it expects the standard will drive downequipment prices and boost demand. BT's systems have actuallybeen on sale in the U.S. in small quantities for months,through the U.S. sales force of British-based GEC-PlesseyTelecommunications Ltd. The new sales campaign gives BT's ownU.S. sales force responsibility for the products and cuts themodel prices to a starting figure of $65,000 per system fromabout $80,000. It aims within three years to have 30% of theU.S. equipment market, which it believes will then be worth$1 billion. However, that figure is considerably higher thansome other recent estimates.   Success is far from assured. One of BT's main salespoints, its use of the international standard, will soon becountered by Japanese and American rivals preparingcomparable products. PictureTel plans within a month tolaunch a competing product that it says will conform to thestandard. And Norman Gaut, PictureTel's chairman and chiefexecutive, said BT's prices are still too high compared withthe $40,000-a-system price of PictureTel's cheapest model.&quot;They've got an uphill battle,&quot; he said.   But BT's video-conference marketing manager, Steve Gandy,said the BT system provides a clearer picture thanPictureTel's. &quot;We're happy to put our product beside theirsand let the world decide&quot; which is better, Mr. Gandy said.</TEXT></DOC>
