In testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, Rudolph Giuliani, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said that insider trading is a &quot;more substantial problem&quot; than anybody thought a few years ago. He called for bigger enforcement budgets for the SEC and Justice Department to deter insider trading and other forms of fraud, and to maintain investor confidence in the markets.    Mr. Giuliani and SEC enforcement director Gary Lynch told lawmakers that they currently are pursuing more insider-trading cases than they were a year ago, but they wouldn't say when the next major Wall Street case will be brought. The scope of the government's investigation is broadening as investigators learn about different violations from cooperative witnesses, including arbitrager Ivan Boesky and investment banker Dennis Levine.    At yesterday's hearing, the prosecutors declined to comment on the extent of collusion among arbitragers, investment bankers, institutional-fund managers and corporate raiders. After huddling, they acknowledged they were looking into collusion, but they didn't elaborate.    Messrs. Giuliani and Lynch endorsed the idea of imposing civil penalties on any securities firm involved in insider-trading violations, but only if the firm fails to show it made a good-faith effort to prevent such violations. One proposal pending in Congress would subject firms to fines as large as the amount of illicit profits involved.    Mr. Giuliani said that the current maximum prison term of five years for fraud is &quot;inadequate&quot; in major insider-trading cases involving multimillion-dollar profits. Judges should be free to impose sentences of &quot;eight, nine, ten years,&quot; he told lawmakers.    The prosecutor also recommended an additional mandatory sentence of at least one or two years for perjury or obstruction of justice in securities-fraud cases. The threat of added jail time would be &quot;useful,&quot; he said, because half of those convicted of insider trading also lie to grand juries or investigators, or otherwise obstruct justice.    Mr. Giuliani, charting the history of insider-trading prosecutions by his office, said 12 cases were brought between 1934 and 1984. In contrast, 50 persons have been prosecuted in the last two and half years. He attributed the sharp rise to both stepped-up enforcement efforts and an increase in insider trading.    Mr. Lynch told lawmakers that the growth in takeover activity has created more opportunities for making large profits on confidential corporate information, while stock-options trading has enabled insider traders to leverage their investments to the hilt. Some young Wall Street professionals haven't been able to resist the temptations of immense but illegal profits, he said.    Messrs. Giuliani and Lynch agreed that while the government is making headway against marketplace fraud, the securities industry must strengthen its system of self-regulation. Mr. Giuliani said that regulation of risk arbitrage -- or trading in takeover stocks -- in particular must be tightened.    But Mr. Lynch said there haven't been enough known breaches of the separation of mergers-and-acquisitions and risk arbitrage departments to justify a law forbidding investment bankers and arbitragers to work under the same roof. </TEXT></DOC>
