This may be used to determine the polarization ofreactor neutrons. The circular polarization of {gamma} quanta at light-waterand graphite targets at the center of the active zone of the VVR-M reactorat the B.P. Konstantinov Leningrad Institute of Nuclear Physics was recentlymeasured. A simplified experimental scheme is shown. Fast neutrons leavingthe active zone of the reactor were excited in the inelastic scatteringat the target nuclei. The polarization of the {gamma} quanta emittedby nuclei in transitions to the ground state was measured by a polarimeterpositioned above the active zone. The reason for the circular polarizationof {gamma} quanta may also be nonconservation of P parity on accountof weak interaction in the capture of a neutron by hydrogen.</TEXT></DOC>
