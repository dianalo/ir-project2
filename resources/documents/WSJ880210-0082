The companies thus join a Unix bandwagon that promises to further blur the distinctions between high-end personal computers and more-powerful machines.    Unix is a powerful operating system developed years ago by American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., but it has been largely confined to the technical-workstation market. However, a number of companies, including Microsoft Corp., Redmond, Wash., and Sun Microsystems Inc., Mountain View, Calif., have developed or plan to develop Unix systems that can operate high-end PCs as well as minicomputers.    The endorsements of Apple and IBM, issued yesterday by top executives of the two computer giants at an industry show in Dallas, represent another step in Unix's evolution as a key software vehicle for linking computers made by different manufacturers and having different levels of power.    &quot;Unix and other industry standards are clearly the most important trends in the computer industry right now,&quot; said John Levinson, computer analyst with Goldman Sachs andamp; Co.    The operating system controls the flow of data inside computers. The growing popularity of Unix is attributable in part to ATandamp;T's willingness to license it throughout the industry, encouraging third-party software publishers to write a wide variety of programs to run on the system. It also offers the key advantage of running applications for more than one user at a time.    In announcing the shipments of its new Unix-based program, called A/UX, for its powerful Macintosh II personal computers, John Sculley, chairman and chief executive officer of Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple, said the product &quot;was driven by requests from our customers in government, higher education and other channels.&quot; He added, &quot;It illustrates our commitment to important standards, and to helping our customers get the most out of their multivendor environments.&quot;    Similarly, William C. Lowe, an IBM vice president, pledged IBM's commitment to &quot;world leadership&quot; in Unix-based microcomputers. Mr. Lowe said IBM intends to offer &quot;a complete set of Unix-based solutions to customers in the technical, engineering/scientific communities and the commercial Unix multi-user environment.&quot;    Two years ago, Armonk, N.Y.-based IBM introduced a Unix-based workstation, its RT PC, that was widely panned in the industry. Although Mr. Lowe said the company has quadrupled the machine's performance since then, analysts say the machine's technology still lags behind such workstation upstarts as Sun Microsystems and Apollo Computer Inc., Chelmsford, Mass. Mr. Lowe's affirmation of IBM's commitment to the Unix market thus dispelled industry speculation that the company might withdraw from that segment.    &quot;We recognize that the Unix opportunity is large and growing, and we intend to participate in that,&quot; said an IBM spokesman.    Apple's new A/UX program shows how Unix is wiping away barriers that have separated computers of various makes and models. With just a minute's delay, Macintosh II users who buy the A/UX addition will be able to toggle between Unix and the customary Macintosh operating system, allowing them to use applications written for both systems. In addition, with Unix, the Macintosh II becomes a multi-user machine, catapulting it into the technical-workstation level of computing power.    The Unix system &quot;tells you they have listened to customers in the technical-workstation world,&quot; said Adam Cuhney, analyst with Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co.    ---   Paul B.
