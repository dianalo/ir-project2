On paper, at least, this 25-articleaccord concludes one of the most drawn-out wars of ourcentury.   The fight began in 1950 with communist North Korea'sinvasion of the South. The two sides battled their way to aheavily armed truce in 1953, with the North backed by Chinaand the Soviet Union, and the South backed by the U.S. andother non-communist allies. Since then, North and South havemaintained a nervous face-off across the demilitarized zone,making the Korean peninsula one of the potential flash pointsfor a major war in Asia. So it is worth watching the courseof the world-wide &quot;tide of reconciliation and cooperation&quot;that South Korea's Prime Minister Chung Won Shik says has nowreached the two Koreas.</LP><TEXT>   Before popping the champagne corks, however, it's crucialto note that peace accords alone don't prevent war. AndFriday's Korean nonaggression pact isn't yet reflected in anydismantling of North Korea's communist regime or its huge,potentially nuclear war machine. North Korea still keeps someone million troops ready to fight the 600,000 South Koreanand 39,000 American troops across the demilitarized zone.   For all the talk about North Korea junking its nucleararms development program and opening its nuclear facilitiesfor inspection, there is no evidence yet that North Korea'sGreat Leader, President Kim Il Sung, has stopped thenuclear-weapons projects that may produce a bomb within thenext two to three years. This is what accounts for thelow-key reaction to the peace pact from the U.S.administration, which wisely said Friday that it will standby its decision to delay U.S. troop withdrawal until NorthKorea has clearly given up its nuclear program.   Further caveats are that the Korean peace accord lacks atimetable and includes a lot of vague and contradictorypromises. For example, article two of the pact says, &quot;Bothparties shall not interfere in each other's internalaffairs,&quot; but other articles promise economic exchange andcooperation. Recall that South Korea is a thriving capitaliststate. But North Korea -- as we observed during a visit therein the summer -- permits no form of domestic privateenterprise, not even China-style private noodle vendors. It'shard to see how North Korea could both deal heavily with theSouth and continue to insulate its repressive centrallyplanned system from the kind of &quot;bourgeois&quot; influence thathas spread through China.   To see North Korean communism undermined by the South'smarkets would be terrific. The problem is that nothing in therecord of Great Leader Kim's career of internal repressionand international terrorism suggests that he would peacefullypermit his communist system to crack. Signing Friday's pactwas for Pyongyang an act not of enlightenment, but ofisolated desperation. Soviet support for North Korea hasmelted along with the Soviet Union itself. And China may soonfollow up its growing economic links to Seoul with officialrecognition.   The day may be near when 79-year-old President Kim dies oris deposed. When that happens, the December 13 nonaggressionpact may more easily start to assume the substance it nowlacks. Until then, we can celebrate the changing of thelabels on the Korean peninsula, from &quot;war&quot; to&quot;nonaggression.&quot; But a stable peace for the Koreans will comeonly when Mr. Kim's communist government -- lock, stock andnuclear program -- is gone for good.</TEXT></DOC>
