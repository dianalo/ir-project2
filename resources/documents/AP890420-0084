However, Bush said it was not clear that any documents are stillwithin his control, saying ``I think they're in the control andcustody of the archivist.'' He said he had no reason to believethat the Reagan administration withheld any documents.   Meeting with a small group of reporters at the White House, thepresident stuck by his earlier refusal to discuss his role in theIran-Contra affair. But, he added, ``Everything I've said, I'llstand behind.''   Documents introduced at the trial of former White House aideOliver North have raised new questions about Bush's involvement,while vice president, in the Reagan administration's secret aid tothe Contra rebels in Nicaragua.   Bush talked about the Iran-Contra affair and other mattersduring an informal news conference with nine reporters. He chose aninformal setting for the gathering, meeting with the press on thecolonnade outside the Oval Office on a sunny spring day.   Bush said he ``might have something to say'' about theIran-Contra affair after the completion of North's trial, which wasin its final stages today. North is accused of lying to Congressand obstructing a congressional investigation, among other charges.   The president has declined in recent days to field questions onIran-Contra, saying he didn't want to prejudice the North case.However, he said today, ``Let's put it this way, my conscience isclear.''   On other subjects Bush:   _Expressed anguish about the shelling in Lebanon, saying hewished he had ``some dramatic plan the players could agree to. It'snot there.''   _Said his administration, which is nearing the 100-day mark, is``moving reasonably well and I don't even think in terms of 100days.'' Citing his broad budget agreement with Congress andcongressional action on his plan to rescue the savings and loanindustry, Bush said, ``We're making some progress.''   The president added, ``I don't feel a need for some precipitousand dramatic initiative in order to salve the conscience of thosewho are saying you've got to do something in 100 days.''   _Said he has not had any discussions nor made any decision aboutoffering military aid to the non-communist resistance in Cambodia.   _Said he has not made a decision on how to modernize the nucleararsenal. Bush said he will be prepared ``very soon to make adecision'' on funding for the Star Wars anti-missile system andwhether to continue deployment of the MX missile or funddevelopment of a single-warhead Midgetman missile.   Questions about the Iran-Contra affair focused on the chargesthat some documents produced in North's trial were not turned overto the congressional committees that investigated the issue.   Bush said he has seen no evidence that all pertinent documentswere not made available.   However, he said, ``I would offer full cooperation for any, anyrequest made of this administration.''   Asked if would release any documents that Congress wants to see,the president said:   ``Well, procedures were set up to determine what documents wereto be made available. Those procedures were agreed to by theCongress, and certainly I would see that if any documents are incontrol of this administration, relevant documents, that we would,we would live assiduously by those guidelines.   ``But I have no reason to believe that the previousadministration, the lawyers in it who worked closely with Congress,did not fulfill their obligation.''   Asked, then, if he would cooperate fully in any Senateinvestigation, Bush said he would ``defer then to the people whowere in charge of the documentation, which would be Mr. (Arthur)Culvahouse (Reagan's White House counsel) and company, in whom Ihave great confidence, but if there's anything we can do toencourage that, absolutely.''   On another subject, Bush said he was not prepared announce anyrestrictions now on semi-automatic weapons, which have figured in awave of violence, much of it spawned by drug dealers.   ``I have expressed my concern about these weapons and theirsuitability so stay tuned. I don't know exactly when it (anannouncement) will be,'' he said.   Asked if thought interest rates should come down in view of theagreement with Congress on the budget, Bush said: ``I was verypleased with the market reaction to the budget agreement. It seemsto have been under-reported, but nevertheless, it's sort ofheartening.''   However, he added, ``I'm not heartened by the (rising) interestrates.''</TEXT></DOC>
