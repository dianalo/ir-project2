Also today, hopes faded that two Britons held hostage in Lebanonwould be freed soon. A radio station said the expected release was``mere speculation.''   Apparently interpreting Bush's statements to mean that release ofthe hostages was a pre-condition for resuming ties with Iran,President Ali Khamenei said, ``In setting conditions for resumptionof ties, the American president should know that we, not they, haveconditions to set.''   ``We have always said that ties with America can only be resumedwhen America revises its arrogant attitude,'' Khamenei added.   ``It was America which expressed interest in resuming ties withIran; Iran does not need America,'' the radio reported him assaying. The report was monitored in Nicosia.   Bush said in his inaugural address that the United States wouldcooperate with any country that could help release the Americanhostages in Lebanon.   He did not mention Iran by name, but his remarks were seen as acall for Iran to help free the hostages with the promise of betterrelations.   Ties between the United States and Iran were severed soon afterthe 1979 Islamic revolution, when militant Iranian students tookover the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage for444 days.   Fifteen foreigners, including the nine Americans, are believedheld hostage in west Beirut by pro-Iranian factions. The hostageheld longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent forThe Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.   Reports in Beirut the last three days spoke of a release bySaturday of John McCarthy, a journalist, and Brian Keenan, a teacherwho holds Irish and British citizenship.   A British Embassy spokesman had said the purpose of AmbassadorAllan Ramsey's visit Thursday to Moslem west Beirut was to check thereports.   However, embassy spokesman Antoine Haddad told The AssociatedPress today: ``We still have no hard information.'' He would notcomment further.   The Voice of the Nation radio station, based in Moslem westBeirut, said today: ``Reports of an imminent hostage releaseappeared to be mere speculation based on rumors.''   McCarthy, 31, a producer for the London-based WorldwideTelevision News agency, was kidnapped April 17, 1986, as he drove tothe airport for a flight home. Keenan, 38, was kidnapped six daysearlier as he walked to the American University of Beirut.   No group has claimed the abduction of McCarthy or Keenan.</TEXT></DOC>
