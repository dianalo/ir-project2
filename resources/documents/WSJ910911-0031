But Sam Donaldson, Kevin Phillips (in &quot;ThePolitics of Rich and Poor&quot;), and many others who denounce&quot;the Reagan years&quot; as a &quot;decade of greed,&quot; seem to thinkotherwise.   There is no getting around the fact that it was aprosperous decade for me, far more so than for the streetpeople, welfare mothers, inhabitants of our prison system,and the doorman and porters in my apartment complex. As bestI can calculate, I have even done better -- in percentageterms, of course -- than our cleaning woman, though it couldbe a close call. It goes without saying that, in those samepercentage terms, I have not done nearly so well as Messrs.Donaldson and Phillips, but I have no reason to think thatthey are greedy, either.</LP><TEXT>   Why did I do so well? The explanation is simple and Mr.Phillips has it right: My wife and I were in the right incomebracket -- the top one-third of the income distribution -- atthe right time. (In 1980, the cut-off line for entering thisbracket was family income of $23,000 a year; in 1990,$40,000.) With the election of Ronald Reagan, our situationtook a distinct turn for the better. During periods ofeconomic expansion, those who are in the top one-third of theincome distribution will always benefit disproportionately,as compared with those below.   Mind you, this holds for the class as a whole, not equallyfor all individuals in it. It is a heterogeneous class, whichincludes not only me but also the Rockefellers, the Kennedys,Reggie Jackson, Madonna, Michael Milken, and the topexecutives of the Fortune 500 corporations.   My own segment of this income class -- theacademic-intellectual segment -- made modest, butnevertheless substantial progress. Our salaries did outpaceinflation, if barely, and the Reagan tax cuts were a welcome,if small, benefit. But we were men and women of property --homes, stocks, bonds, etc. -- which appreciated smartly inthe 1980s. So did our pensions.   Academic pensions are of the &quot;defined contributions&quot;variety, as distinct from the common &quot;defined benefits&quot; type.In the former, there are limits to how much one can invest ina pension fund but no limits on the size of the pension --that will depend on how the funds' investments make out. Thegarden-variety pension plan that covers most Americansadjusts the contributions so as to achieve a fixed pensionpayout upon retirement. With both stocks and bonds doingextraordinarily well during the decade, professors today areretiring with far higher pensions than they ever expected toreceive.   Needless to say, very few professors see any connectionbetween their increased prosperity and the &quot;decade of greed&quot;they are quick to denounce. After all, that increase did notresult from the vulgar pursuit of money on their part -- onlyfrom other people's vulgar pursuit of money. This leavesacademia in possession of both the high moral ground and themoney.   So, yes, President Reagan's economic policies benefited meto a significant degree, and I have to confess that this hasbeen, for me, an especially pleasurable experience. That isbecause I had been, along with Jack Kemp and others, anexponent of &quot;supply-side economics&quot; ever since the mid-1970s.So I felt a kind of personal entitlement to my good fortune.In any case, having spent a lifetime moving from the bottomthird to the top third, I refuse to define this banalAmerican success story as an example of &quot;greed.&quot;   So where was the greed? Well, there were certain phenomenaof the 1980s that do come to mind when one hears the term, &quot;adecade of greed.&quot; None of them has anything to do with RonaldReagan's tax cuts, and they have little or nothing to do withsins of commission or omission by his administration.   There was, for instance, the spectacular increase inleveraged buyouts of corporations (LBOs), during which someincredible amounts of money were made by incredibly young,freshly minted investment bankers who invested nothing butcharged many millions for their wise advice. That investmentbankers are &quot;greedy&quot; for profitable business opportunitiesshould astonish no one. That their advice was almost alwaysunwanted and unnecessary will also surprise no one who hasever sat on a corporate board. What few people realize,however, is that corporations hire investment bankers not outof any altruistic compassion for fellow capitalists, butbecause the government's regulatory agencies and the courtsmake it impossible for them not to do so.   Whenever corporate management undertakes an action thatmight significantly affect the value of its assets and/orstock price, it has to be provided with an &quot;objective&quot; and&quot;expert&quot; opinion that what it is doing is in the interests ofits stockholders. Otherwise, it will face punitive legalactions. So management goes out and buys such an opinion froman investment banker, preferably one of the larger, moreprestigious ones. Since there are not many such, and theyhave been in great demand, they charge whatever the marketcan bear, and perhaps a bit more. None of this has anythingto do with something the Reagan administration did or did notdo. It is the way our system of corporate governance hasevolved over recent decades.   Many of the LBOs themselves, where existing managementparticipated, were indeed dramatic examples of flaming greed.Others were simply highly speculative &quot;buyouts&quot; financed by&quot;junk bonds.&quot; Since the stockholders made a handsome profitfrom either kind of LBO, there was no legal basis forintervention by any regulatory agency, which had no brief toprotect the banks and insurance companies that foolishlybought these bonds. In any case, the damage to financialinstitutions from investing in LBOs was relatively trivialwhen compared with their horrendous losses from rashinvestments in real estate.   Then there was the incredible spectacle of another mob offreshly minted traders in bonds and other (often also freshlyminted) financial instruments making millions a year. Thisscene has been well described in Michael Lewis's &quot;Liar'sPoker&quot; and it is, in truth, utterly repellent even for thosewho favor free-market economies. But Michael Lewis is acolorful reporter, not an economic analyst, and refers onlycasually, and in passing, to the special circumstances thatmade this bizarre moment in our financial history possible.Most readers, I am confident, missed those references.   To begin with, there was the advent of powerful computersand the ability of these machines to communicate almostinstantaneously. Obviously those firms (like SalomonBrothers) that were the first to learn how to participate inthis expanded market made out like bandits -- until thecompetition finally caught up and brought bid and askedprices into closer alignment.   Then there was the fact that the Federal Reserve, in theearly 1980s, decided to control the money supply rather thaninterest rates. The resulting gyrations in interest rates inall the major nations opened a grand casino for the bold andclever trader.   Finally, Congress insisted on, and the Reaganadministration acceded to, the deregulation of the savingsand loans, while actually hiking the federal insurance oftheir deposits. The Sandamp;Ls -- whose managements were not verysophisticated -- immediately began to pour their money intovarious new speculative financial instruments, invented bythose ingenious investment bankers. There was greed here,most certainly, as well as old-fashioned corruption andappalling stupidity. But the Sandamp;Ls were the darlings (becausethey were financial supporters) of those same liberalDemocrats in Congress who are now so denunciatory of &quot;adecade of greed,&quot; while the Reagan administration played noleading role in &quot;liberating&quot; those Sandamp;Ls for their suicidalventures.   A decade of prosperity and high growth always producesspeculative excesses. (Just look at scandal-ridden Japan])The economic policies of the Reagan administration weresurely responsible, in good part at least, for the prosperityand the growth. As for the speculative excesses -- well, fromthe South Sea Bubble to today, the sight of easy money alwaystends to encourage loose morals. Human beings are like that,Reagan administration or no Reagan administration.   ---   Mr. Kristol, an American Enterprise Institute fellow,co-edits The Public Interest and publishes The NationalInterest.</TEXT></DOC>
