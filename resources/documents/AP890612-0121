AHN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Police on Monday arrested about a dozenradical students who were trying to protest a police raid and theseizure of pro-North Korea pamphlets.   About 600 students rallied at Sogang University had tried tomarch to a nearby police station, but about 1,000 riot policecarrying shields blocked their passage and made the arrests. Noinjuries were reported.   Police raided the university Friday and seized more than 2,000pamphlets on a youth festival to be held July 1-8 in Pyongyang, thecapital of North Korea.   The government has banned South Koreans from taking part in thesports and cultural event but many students have said they will tryto participate anyway. The festival is for students from Third Worldand communist nations.   The pre-dawn raid came amid a crackdown on anti-governmentprotests.   At nearby Yonsei University, about 400 radical students ralliedfor two hours in front of the school, then dispersed voluntarily.They demanded the release of student leaders arrested by police onSaturday in violent anti-government street demonstrations. Policemade no arrests.   In Pusan, the nation's second-largest city, 800 students from twouniversities hurled rocks at riot police and denounced thegovernment ban on attending the youth festival, the Yonhap NewsAgency said. Police fired tear gas to break up the protests, but noarrests or injuries were reported.   Radical students and dissident leaders want the resignation ofPresident Roh Tae-woo and withdrawal of U.S. troops stationed inSouth Korea. They say the United States supports an authoritariangovernment and blocks unification of the two nations.   The students have received little support because of theirviolent tactics.   In the southwestern city of Kwangju, an autopsy was performed onthe charred body of a man found dead in a pool of paint thinner atChosun University. The results of the autopsy were not released.   Police said they suspected the man, Kim Kyung-chan, 20, hadcommitted suicide. A friend said Kim was suffering from anunspecified illness, which might have prompted a suicide.   Chosun has been hit by violent anti-government protests since astudent leader, Lee Chol-kyu, was found dead at a reservoir near thecity last month.   Authorities have said Lee drowned after fleeing police butstudents have said he may have been tortured. Lee's death touchedoff violent street protests in Kwangju.   Also on Monday, Roh warned that high salary increases and laborunrest are undermining the economy. He appealed to employers andworkers to show restraint and work together.   Roh said labor unrest cost the economy $4.5 billion in lostproduction so far this year. He said that figure included $1 billionin lost exports.   The wages of South Korean workers have risen in the past twoyears after years of low salaries that gave its industry a majorprice advantage over other Asian exporters.</TEXT></DOC>
