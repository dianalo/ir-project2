Enormousnatural variation has been seen when the phenotypes of different R allelesare compared in a common genetic background. Some alleles have been shownto have a compound structure resulting from gene duplication and divergence.In these complex alleles, each member of the duplication (called R genicelements) has a unique pattern of expression. The function of the R locusis not known; genetic and biochemical analyses suggest that it may encodea protein that regulates other genes in the anthocyanin pathway. Overthe past year we have determined that the genic elements (P), (S), and(Lc) all encode a very rare 2.8 kb transcript that is present in tissuedisplaying anthocyanin pigmentation. cDNA libraries have been constructedusing mRNA isolated from tissues shown by Northern blots to be enrichedfor the R transcript. Full-length cDNAs will be sequenced and comparedto each other.</TEXT></DOC>
