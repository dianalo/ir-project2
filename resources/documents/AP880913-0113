Cordes said hefelt ``born again.''   Hugging his tearful wife tightly, Cordes was escorted by Syriansecurity officers to the Foreign Ministry in Damascus at 5 p.m. andturned over to West German government envoys by Foreign MinisterFarouk al-Sharaa.   ``I'm rejoicing for being a free man again. I feel I'm bornagain,'' Cordes said. ``It is as if I have been granted a new life.I am feeling perfect, and I'm in a very good shape.''   Earlier, Cordes and his wife had an emotional reunion at thegovernment guest house where he spent the night after his release.   ``She fell into his arms and they kissed each other for a longtime,'' an official who witnessed the reunion told The AssociatedPress.   He said Mrs. Cordes turned to Syrian army officers who escortedher from the airport to the guest house and said: ``Thank you.Thank you so much.''   Cordes, 55, was released late Monday in Beirut by pro-IranianShiite Moslem extremists who kidnapped him in January 1987. He wasdriven to Damascus by Brig. Ali Hammoud, Syria's militaryintelligence chief in Beirut.   Cordes was the last West German hostage in Lebanon, where 17other foreigners are held captive. Asked today if he had seen anyof the other hostages, he said: ``I haven't seen any hostages. Iwas alone.''   Cordes' captors said his release was linked to a Lebanese Shiiteon trial in West Germany for the 1985 hijacking of the TWA jet andthe shooting death of U.S. Navy diver Robert Stethem.   In a note issued in Beirut, they said if Mohammed Ali Hamadi'srelease cannot be gained legally, ``then we shall be obliged toagain resort to violence.''   Cordes and his wife were expected to drive from the ForeignMinistry to the airport to take off in the Canadian-builttwin-engined jet for the five-hour flight to a military airbasenear Bonn.   Seventeen foreigners, including nine Americans, are stillmissing in Lebanon and it is believed most are held by pro-IranianShiite kidnappers. Longest held is Terry Anderson, chief MiddleEast correspondent for The Associated Press. Anderson, 40, waskidnapped in Beirut on March 16, 1985.   In Bonn, a West German government spokesman, who asked not to befurther identified, said he knew of no deal with Iran or with thekidnappers for Cordes' freedom.   The government has repeatedly denied that it paid a ransom forthe release last September for Alfred Schmidt, another West Germanwho had been held captive in Beirut.   Chancellor Helmut Kohl said his government will use thecountry's ties with Iran and Syria to try gain freedom for otherhostages in Lebanon. And Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genschercredited West Germany's continuing ties with Iran for helping tobring about Cordes' release.   Cordes and Schmidt were kidnapped in Beirut in January 1987 inthe week after Hamadi's arrest in Frankfurt.   Schmidt, an engineer, was freed Sept. 7, 1987.   Hamadi, 24, has acknowledged in a Frankfurt court to hijackingthe plane but denies killing Stethem. In the murder and air piracytrial Monday, the captain of the hijacked jetliner, John Testrake,testified that he believed Hamadi fired the shot that killedStethem aboard the aircraft.   The kidnappers' note, one of three issued Monday in Beirut, saidthe decision to release Cordes ``does not mean in any way theabandonment of holy warrior Mohammed Hamadi.''   His brother, Abbas Hamadi, 29, is serving a 13-year prisonsentence in Frankfurt. He was convicted in April of complicity inkidnapping Cordes and Schmidt in an effort to force West Germany tofree Mohammed Hamadi.   In another development, Lebanon radio and U.S. officials said anAmerican engineer who was kidnapped in Lebanon on Sundayoverpowered his captors and escaped to Damascus on Monday with thehelp of Syrian troops.   Another version said Syrian troops in Lebanon rescued theengineer, identified in Washington as Kenneth Wells, afteroverpowering the kidnappers.   The discrepancies could not immediately be reconciled.   Gunmen abducted Wells, 25, who reportedly works in Saudi Arabiafor Litton Industries and holds a black belt in karate.</TEXT></DOC>
