(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Gov. Richard Bryan said Thursday he hasordered weekly state inspections when production resumes at theonly U.S. plant making a fuel component crucial for militaryrockets and the space shuttle.   Bryan said he will not try to block the resumption next week ofammonium perchlorate production at the Kerr-McGee Corp. plant here.   ``We are under the impression the fire department believes alltheir concerns were met,'' Bryan said.   The plant came under scrutiny after the only other U.S. plantmanufacturing the rocket fuel oxidizer was destroyed in a series ofexplosions May 4 that killed two people and caused an estimated $73million damage.   Bryan ordered the state Division of Occupational Safety andHealth to begin inspecting the Kerr-McGee plant in unannouncedweekly visits. He also said he wants to work with federal officialsto minimize the plant's storage of ammonium perchlorate.   Kerr-McGee officials said the company will resume production ofammonium perchlorate Monday morning. The plant had been shut downsince May 12 after state officials threatened to sue the companyfor creating a public hazard.   Clark County Fire Chief Roy Parrish said Thursday he waswithholding approval on resumption of production until the districtattorney's office reviews a letter sent by Kerr-McGee that companyofficials said answers the fire department's concerns.   Anita Bridges, a Kerr-McGee spokeswoman, said the company hiredindependent safety experts to inspect the plant and has ``doneeverything humanly possible to try to alleviate the fears andconcerns of our operation.''   The Kerr-McGee plant can make 36 million pounds a year ofammonium perchlorate, the oxidizier used on space shuttle boostersand military and civilian rockets. The destroyed PacificEngineering andamp; Production Co. plant had the capacity to produce 20million pounds per year.   The House Committee on Science, Space and Technology was told ina recent hearing that demand for ammonium perchlorate would risefrom 37.8 million pounds this year to more than 60 million poundsin 1989.   Each set of shuttle boosters uses 1.7 million pounds of ammoniumperchlorate, and National Aeronautics and Space Administrationofficials said Wednesday that the agency had eight booster rocketson hand, enough for four flights.   Richard Truly, chief of NASA's space flight program, said theagency's schedule of nine missions next year might have to beadjusted, depending on how long the shortage lasts.</TEXT></DOC>
