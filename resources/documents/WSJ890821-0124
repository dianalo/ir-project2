Maybe too many of today's prosecutors were influenced by the prevailing counterculture suspicions of middle-class morality during their law-school days. But another answer is simpler: It is easier to extract plea bargains from traders, with a mere mention of RICO, than from real felons.    The statistics on violent crime are numbing. Murder, robbery and rape all were up in 1988, with a total increase of 5.5%. FBI Director Sessions says &quot;violent crime known to law enforcement reached an unprecedented high in 1988.&quot; The tabloid New York Post one recent day had these subheadlines: &quot;Undercover Cop Shot in Back.&quot; &quot;Four Slain in Mob Rubouts.&quot; &quot;Bullets Fly on Bleecker St.&quot; &quot;Drug Widower: I'll Fight On.&quot; &quot;Dramatic photos on pages 4, 5, 7, 8 and 9.&quot;    President Bush and Drug Czar Bennett want to fight the war on drugs in the streets, where the dealers and users are, but maybe they forgot to tell the Justice Department. Attorney General Thornburgh is proud of coining the moral-equivalency phrase &quot;crime in the suites.&quot; Not long after creating six Securities and Commodities Fraud Task Forces, Mr. Thornburgh decided to disband the long-standing Organized Crime Strike Forces. In New York, Rudy Giuliani's hand-picked replacement, Benito Romano, sees only a &quot;superficial irony&quot; in moving top aides from the fight against the Mob and drug lords to go after bankers and traders; he says white-collar cases &quot;are the most difficult to bring.&quot;    Now, markets do indeed need rules if their effectiveness in allocating capital and goods is not to be sacrificed to public distrust. All exchanges in the U.S. recognize their own self-interest in rule enforcement. A few traders have been guilty of what would be crimes even in the absence of exchange rules, such as theft of information. But some crimes threaten society and some do not. Is it too much to ask law enforcers to give top priority to wide-scale violence, rather than Giuliani-type cases elevating stock parking to racketeering status?    Most Americans agree on the real crime problem. A recent National Law Journal/LEXIS survey asked which crime should rank the highest for law enforcement; 47% said drug dealing, 32% said muggings and rapes, 11% said racketeering -- and 3% said white-collar crimes.    The survey asked this hypothetical: An armed robber gets away with $5,000 from a bank. So does an embezzler. What sentences would you give? Streets vs. suites was no contest: Nearly half would have put the armed robber away for more than 10 years, while only 12% thought the white-collar embezzler should serve more than 10 years, with one-third saying he should serve less than two.    The survey, not to mention simple logic, makes it clear where the public would like prosecutors to direct their efforts. Many of us are dumbfounded by recent examples of misdirection, such as the frivolous antitrust case brought by state attorneys general accusing insurance companies of causing the tort crisis.    No doubt law-enforcement officials find it frustrating to try to nail real felons. Clearly, they would be aided in doing so if courts restored some recognition of the principle that the goal of trials is to find the truth and punish the guilty. New York's ultra-liberal court rules could actually bar from evidence admissions by several youths that they attacked and gang-raped the young woman jogger in Central Park earlier this year. Law-enforcement officials also might ask Congress why they never got the local prosecutors, judges and jailers promised under the huge anti-drug bill.    We are sympathetic toward those prosecutors who feel they have hit a brick wall of procedural protections for drug pushers, youth gangs and other major perpetrators. But this is not much of an excuse for launching dubious prosecutions at easier targets. Their efforts should be bent instead on getting tools that will enable them to accomplish their main task: regaining control of the cities from thugs and murderers. </TEXT></DOC>
