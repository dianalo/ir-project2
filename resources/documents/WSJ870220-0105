In its annual report to Congress on human-rights practices, covering 167 governments, the department said that Nicaragua &quot;expanded its drive to immobilize the opposition during 1986 with official attacks on political parties,&quot; the closing of the leading opposition newspaper and a Catholic radio station and numerous incidents of arrests and torture. The report asserted that refugees entering Costa Rica claimed that the Sandinistas also have begun using death squads against rural inhabitants.    But in mentioning Sandinista claims that about 1,000 civilians had been killed by the Contras last year, the report said, &quot;Independent verification of the combatant status of victims . . . is virtually impossible&quot; because the government controls access to the sites of the alleged killings.    Richard Schifter, assistant secretary of state for human rights, said during a briefing yesterday that the most troubling human-rights development last year was the &quot;sharp deterioration&quot; of conditions in South Africa, where he said 10,000 people -- many of whom are teen-agers -- are still held in detention as a result of the state of emergency declared last June.    Discussing recent Soviet actions that Moscow claims are part of a move toward political &quot;openness,&quot; Mr. Schifter said &quot;the release of prisoners is to be welcomed on purely humanitarian grounds.&quot; But he added that &quot;it is not freedom yet, not by a long shot.&quot;    Mr. Schifter praised the dramatic improvements in human-rights practices in the Philippines and Haiti, both of which overthrew dictatorships last year, and Guatemala, which made a transition from military rule to democracy.    He called communist North Korea &quot;probably the worst human-rights offender in the world.&quot; The report cites continuing reports of torture in South Korea, but it depicts such abuses as aberrations.    On Nicaragua, the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, which often criticizes the Reagan administration, recently charged that the White House &quot;distorts the facts, charging the Nicaraguan government with abuses far in excess of what it actually commits,&quot; while overlooking Contra abuses.    Mr. Shifter denied that the State Department report reflects the Reagan administration's political bias. </TEXT></DOC>
