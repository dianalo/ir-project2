The final tally showed 3,700 workers rejecting the offer and3,682 accepting it, a Jaguar spokesman, who wasn't identified, inaccordance with British custom, said Thursday.   The result was decided by the votes cast late Wednesday by 800night-shift workers.   The spokesman said Jaguar would appeal the outcome, which wasbased on votes cast at open meetings, and would ask the union tostage a secret ballot.   Those voting against the contract offer represented only 42percent of eligible voters, and the company hopes a secret votewould increase the voter turnout.   ``We would like a secret ballot to sort this out,'' the Jaguarspokesman said. ``This vote is not a sufficient mandate for damagingindustrial action.''   In negotiations last weekend Jaguar made what it said was itsfinal offer, a two-year deal including raises of 4.7 percent in thefirst year and 4.4 percent in the second, plus bonuses.   Jaguar said its workers earn an average 210 pounds, or theequivalent of $361, per week.</TEXT></DOC>
