The planned staff reductions were disclosed in a FinancialTimes interview with Barclays Chairman Sir John Quinton.While confirming the cutbacks, Barclays officials said thereductions will occur over five to 10 years, mostly throughresignations, retirements and reduced recruitment. Barclays,the largest clearing bank in Britain, has about 87,000employees in the U.K.</LP><TEXT>   The stretched-out time period for the staff cuts is likelyto ease any immediate fears at the bank, but it suggests thatU.K. banks could face difficulties long after Britain pullsout of the current recession. &quot;U.K. banking -- regardless ofthe recession -- is going to have a period of lowerprofitability,&quot; said Robert Law, an analyst with LehmanBrothers International in London. &quot;All the banks will have tokeep their businesses under a tighter rein than in the past.&quot;   Details on staff reductions at Barclays will emerge Feb.28, when the bank reports its results for 1990. Barclays willalso tell shareholders whether it plans to adhere to a pastpolicy of increasing the dividend each year.   According to Barclays officials, the planned cutbacksreflect more than the severe banking climate of the early1990s. Improved technology reduces personnel needs, oneofficial noted, adding that demographic shifts in Britain areshrinking the pool of available workers.   The prediction of thousands of job losses also may betactical. Barclays is in the thick of wage negotiations.Workers have rejected a 7% wage increase, and the bank isn'tmaking any more generous offers.   Keith Brown, an analyst with Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., saidthat the cost-cutting moves could position Barclays forhealthy profits once Britain is on the other side of thepresent recession. In the meantime, he interprets thestatements from Barclays officials as being a warning that&quot;the profits for 1990 and 1991 are going to be prettyhorrible.&quot;   Lehman Brothers' Mr. Law slashed his estimate forBarclays' 1990 pretax profit to #780 million ($1.54 billion)from last month's forecast of #900 million. Forecasters havealso downgraded their projections for Lloyds Bank PLC,National Westminster Bank PLC and Midland Bank PLC.   The most painful side of the banking difficulties is thesurge in bad debts. Morgan Stanley predicted that this yearwill see a 35% increase in insolvencies from 1990. The firmforecast that bad-debt provisions at the major clearing banksin Britain will rise to #4.6 billion for 1990 and #5.1billion this year. That compares with #1.9 billion in 1989.   The major British banks have built up their operations incontinental Europe, but competition for market share there isfierce. Moreover, the continental economies are slowing down,making it difficult to count on profits from France or Spainto offset losses at home.</TEXT></DOC>
