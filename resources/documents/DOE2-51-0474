The paperpresents condensed versions of the following lectures: 1. Fundamentalsof NO/sub x/ generation and control, 2. Legal boundary conditions forlimiting NO/sub x/ emissions, 3. Technical consequences of limiting valuesfor NO/sub x/ emissions in the Federal Republic of Germany, 4. Statusof NO/sub x/ emissions and measures to control NO/sub x/ emissions fromhousehold gas fire-places and power stations; 5. Status of NO/sub x/emissions and measures to control NO/sub x/ emissions from industrialfurnaces in the metal and ceramics sector; 6. NO/sub x/ emissions andcontrol of NO/sub x/ emissions from large gas-fired boilers; 7. NO/subx/ emissions and control of NO/sub x/ emissions in the case of stationarycombustion engines; 8. NO/sub x/ emissions and control of NO/sub x/ emissionsfrom gas turbines; 9. Limiting values for NO/sub x/ on an internationalscale. (BWI).</TEXT></DOC>
