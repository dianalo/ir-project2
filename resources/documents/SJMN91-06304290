But this time around, after earlier protestsfrom neighbors, he had scaled back the housing by more than 70 percent andincreased the retail so that it could include a large supermarket as well asother stores.;   The council approved the land-use decision by a vote of 4 to3. This is the second such project Vidovich is building in the city, to goalong with two others in Cupertino and Sunnyvale. His other Santa Claraproject, which puts rental apartments above stores, is being built at FloraVista and El Camino Real.;   &quot;The message I seem to be getting from peoplehere tonight is that mixed use is OK as long as it is not in my back yard,&quot;said Councilman Tim Jeffries, who made the motion in support of the project,after more than two hours of negative reactions from neighbors. &quot;Thisphenomenon in our community and county deeply disturbs me.&quot;;   Mixed use --the mixing of housing with retail stores -- is a concept that is new toCalifornia but familiar for a long time in older cities in the East.;   It isthought to be a way to cut down the time needed to be spent in cars by puttingshopping near housing and by putting higher densities of houses and shopsalong major transit corridors.;   Stevens Creek is scheduled for the nextmajor phase of the county's light rail, making it ideal for mixed use, notedMayor Everett &quot;Eddie&quot; Souza.;   Neighbors said the townhouses on top of retailwould tower over nearby single-family homes; they didn't like the fact thattrucks would be using an alleyway behind the stores to service them; and theydidn't like added traffic and density of the homes.;   Most said theypreferred leaving the center as a shopping area without housing.;   Severalpeople asked the council to approve the project because it would fill a needfor affordable housing. The 1,200-square-foot homes would sell for around$160,000, Vidovich promised.;   Judy Nadler, who voted against the proposal,said she didn't think it would help the neighborhood's character. DaveDeLozier also opposed it, saying he didn't like the tall townhouses so nearthe neighborhood. Don Von Raesfeld said he didn't like the way the project wasdesigned and felt the council was too restrictive on the developer because itwas making him take down a billboard at the site.;   Souza, Lasher, Jeffriesand Deto said they supported mixed use projects and thought they were animportant part of the city's future.;   Souza, who took a $5,000 campaigncontribution from Vidovich, said the donation had nothing to do with his voteand at last week's City Council meeting he said he resented critics whoimplied that it might.;   &quot;I did not seek it,&quot; Souza said of the donation, thelargest he received over the past six months.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  BRAD KAVA, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911030  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  10  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  564  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, October 30, 199100304290,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
