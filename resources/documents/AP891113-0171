She also said in remarks to the Lord Mayor's banquet that theEuropean Economic Community should hold out a helping hand to thedemocracies being formed in the Soviet bloc.   In a message to Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Mrs. Thatcher assured theSoviet president the West does not intend to ``poach'' East Germanyfrom the Kremlin's sphere of influence, according to reports byIndependent Television News and Press Association, Britain'sdomestic news agency.   ``Freedom (is) once more on the offensive,'' Mrs. Thatcher saidin the speech, but ``times of great change are times of greatuncertainty, even danger.''   After noting the extent and speed of reforms in the SovietUnion, Poland, Hungary and East Germany, the prime ministerdeclared: ``The way in which we in the West respond to thesehistoric changes could be crucial in determining their success.   ``The very speed of change could put the goal of democracy injeopardy. ... Strong emotions have been aroused on all sides byrecent events. The need now is to take a measured view of the wayahead.''   Mrs. Thatcher urged continuation of the ``strength and resolve''of NATO, which she said set the stage for the reforms, and warnedagainst complacency.   ``It must be through NATO that we continue to keep the peace bytried and tested means, while welcoming every step that allows usto do so safely at lower levels of forces and weapons,'' she said.   ``We should honor those in the Communist countries who never letrepression and dictatorship break their spirit or their unshakeablebelief in liberty, and who are now seeing their hopes realized.   ``We must give them every possible encouragement and support. Weare doing just that in all our contacts with the Soviet Union underMr. Gorbachev, and in the practical help _ with food, training,trade _ that we are giving to Poland and Hungary. We cannot andmust not let their brave efforts fail.''   The 12 nations of the European Economic Community have a specialresponsibility to Eastern Europe, she said.   ``We must stretch out the hand of co-operation and develop newforms of association with the emerging democracies of EasternEurope _ Poland, Hungary, East Germany and, we hope, others willfollow.''</TEXT></DOC>
