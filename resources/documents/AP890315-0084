(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A state trooper responding to a mother'surgent plea stopped a school bus and confiscated grapes from an11-year-old girl and several other children.   Sally Johnson and more than 50 other choir members from PleasantValley School in a Portland suburb were traveling toward Eugene fora music festival Tuesday when Trooper Rod Beach pulled the bus over.   Beach climbed on and wanted to know if a Sally Johnson was aboard.   Sally nervously identified herself. ``Can I have your lunch?''asked the no-nonsense trooper.   Beach said the grapes Sally'd cajoled her mother into buying theprevious night could be contaminated by cyanide.   ``What's going to happen to me?'' asked Sally. ``Am I going to bearrested?''   Beach took Sally's contraband into custody, and several otherstudents also surrendered grapes.   Sally's mother, Catherine, had not heard the federal warningabout contaminated Chilean grapes until after she had put Sally onthe bus. When she heard the news, she called state police.   ``I tried to get her to buy a banana,'' she said later.</TEXT></DOC>
