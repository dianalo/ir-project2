Travelers Corp. said it had offered 8,000 of its 37,000 employees in the U.S. the opportunity to leave voluntarily with a payout and benefits depending on years of service.    A Travelers spokesman said each department is being asked to trim their employment budgets as much as 40%. Non-officers are being offered two weeks' pay for each year of service up to a total of 52 weeks; officers, four weeks pay for each year of service up to 52. Both receive accrued vacations and medical benefits during the period the payout is received.    The Travelers spokesman said an estimate of savings from the cutbacks hasn't yet been determined.    Phoenix Mutual Life Insurance Co. said it plans to reduce its annual operating expenses by $25 million, or 17% of its total operating costs, excluding commissions, through operation reductions, reassignment of personnel and attrition.    A first step is elimination of a 16-person services department that maintains records and renders tax advice for corporate pension accounts. The 16 will be reassigned throughout the company, a spokeswoman said. Phoenix is negotiating with Milliman andamp; Robertson, an actuarial consulting firm based in New York, to take over the service contracts, she added. </TEXT></DOC>
