The order, which confirms options Northwest has held since April1987, calls for 20 A340s, which cost $93 million each and seat up to280 passengers, and 10 A330s, which cost $86 million each and seatup to 330 passengers, according to Northwest spokesman Bob Gibbons.Four of the A330s are being taken on option.   ``The A330s and A340s offer Northwest fleet commonality and thebenefits of advanced technology, lower operating costs and superiorcargo-carrying capability,'' Steve Rothmeier, chairman ofNorthwest's parent NWA Inc., said in a statement.   Northwest is the first North American airline to purchase A340s,while it and Trans World Airlines are the first North Americancarriers to buy A330s, said Airbus spokesman Gregg Schulte.   Both planes are still being tested, Gibbons said.   Northwest, which had no A340s on order previously, expects toreceive the 20 ordered Thursday in 1992, he said.   The four-engine widebody aircraft, powered by CFM InternationalCFM56-5 engines, will be used on Northwest's extensive trans-Pacificroutes. It has a range of up to 8,600 miles.   Northwest already has 10 A330s on order and expects to receivethose in 1994, Gibbons said. The carrier expects to add theadditional six to its fleet in 1995.   The A330, a twin-engine widebody with a range of more than 5,200miles, will be powered by Pratt and Whitney PW4000 engines and willbe used on major domestic and trans-Atlantic routes, Northwest said.   On July 1, Northwest became the first North American carrier toadd Airbus A320 jetliners to its fleet.   The carrier has three of the twin-engine, widebody planes in its315-plane fleet and expects to add four more by the end of the year.Twenty-five of the planes should be in use by March 1992. Northwesthas an option for 75 more A320s, Gibbons said.   With Thursday's orders and other previously announced orders andoptions, Northwest could operate 140 Airbus aircraft by the end ofthe 1990s, Gibbons said.</TEXT></DOC>
