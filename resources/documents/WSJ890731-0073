Although the Supreme Court's recent decision to limit the right to abortion is the biggest anti-abortion victory, it isn't the only one.    Anti-abortion forces are blocking medical research that might help infertile couples and people suffering from incurable diseases, influencing appointments at the Department of Health and Human Services, and successfully campaigning to limit federal assistance for family planning.    &quot;Federal policy has moved consistently in our direction, of course not as quickly as we would like,&quot; says Douglas Johnson, legislative director of the National Right to Life Committee. &quot;The pro-life movement remains vigilant about measures that expand abortion rights,&quot; he says. As a result, anti-abortion activists carefully monitor medical-research policies and federal health programs they think might allow or encourage abortions.    &quot;They have been all over the place and in many ways quite destructive,&quot; says Jeannie Rosoff, president of The Alan Guttmacher Institute, a family-planning research group.    Right now, anti-abortion groups are fighting to broaden restrictions on medical research. Responding to pressure from anti-abortion forces last year, HHS blocked the National Institutes of Health from funding research on fetal-tissue transplants. Researchers want to explore suggestions that the implantation of small amounts of fetal tissue could help treat diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and diabetes. &quot;But we're not going to get that unless we can study fetal tissue,&quot; says Dr. Tamela Davis, a professor of pediatrics at Case Western Reserve Medical School in Cleveland and the president of the American Federation for Clinical Research.    HHS is reviewing a National Institutes of Health recommendation that the funding suspension be lifted. But the decision will be sensitive for HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan, a doctor who has allied himself with anti-abortion positions but who says he has &quot;reservations about any blanket prohibition on medical research.&quot;    Anti-abortion groups vow to fight any effort to allow such research and say they will ask the White House to overrule Dr. Sullivan if he resumes funding. &quot;In our view it would be insane for the federal government to embrace any policy which assumes a large supply of dead fetuses. From an administration that wants to ban all abortions, that would clearly be inconsistent,&quot; Mr. Johnson says.    Although disturbing to medical researchers, this position doesn't stir much public opposition. &quot;If you're talking about fetal research to young women who are concerned about whether they can get abortions, it seems pretty remote,&quot; Ms. Rosoff says.    Some elements of the anti-abortion movement also are opposing federal funding for research on in-vitro fertilization. They complain that fertilizing ova outside the womb and then reimplanting an embryo often leads to the destruction of embryos. Federal funding of IVF research has been stalled for nearly 10 years by a bureaucratic Catch-22: All research must be cleared by a government ethics advisory board, but the panel was abolished in 1980, leaving no way to authorize projects.    Last year the Reagan administration announced plans to revive the panel, but nothing has happened yet. As a result, the federal government still can't fund research that may offer hope to the nation's 2.4 million infertile married couples. All the research is private.    Opposition from anti-abortion groups also is preventing a joint House-Senate panel called the Biomedical Ethics Board from getting off the ground. Formed in 1985 to issue reports on the implications of human genetic engineering and guidelines for federally funded fetal research, the panel hasn't yet started its work. Last year Congress gave a two-year extension to the panel, which is aiming to produce its two reports, plus a third on the withdrawal of nutrition and hydration from dying patients, in 1990. But the panel doesn't have a chairman or enough money and may miss its deadlines again.    And anti-abortion forces are blocking appointments at HHS. Earlier this year they prevented Robert Fulton from taking a high post there after charging that he hadn't responded properly to reports of infant euthanasia in an Oklahoma hospital. Mr. Fulton, formerly the director of human services in Oklahoma, strongly denies the charges.    Government-funded family-planning services, provided under Title 10 of the Public Health Service Act, also bothers the anti-abortion movement. Dr. C. Everett Koop, the anti-abortion surgeon general, argues that more sex education and birth control are needed to combat abortion. &quot;If you want to get rid of abortions, you better get rid of the reason for them -- unwanted pregnancy,&quot; he explains.    But sex education and birth control are sensitive issues for the anti-abortion movement. While the National Right to Life Committee doesn't take positions for or against birth control and sex education, other anti-abortion groups contend that the programs often lead to an increase in pregnancies. &quot;The more money that goes into Title 10, the more teen-agers get pregnant,&quot; argues Michael Schwartz, an anti-abortion activist at the Free Congress Foundation.    Ms. Rosoff charges that the anti-abortion movement &quot;basically has overlooked anything that makes sexual behavior less dangerous. They want to make sure that no sex takes place outside of marriage.&quot;    Politics and budgetary austerity have limited Title 10 funding to about $140 million a year for several years. As a result, Faye Wattleton, president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, says 65% of the women eligible for the services can't receive them. The program primarily serves low-income women; about a third of those who receive family planning and contraceptive services through the program are adolescents, according to HHS.    The department has issued guidelines that prevent the approximately 4,000 family-planning clinics supported by the program from promoting abortion as a method of planning, but family-planning groups are challenging the guidelines in court.    ---   Alan L.
