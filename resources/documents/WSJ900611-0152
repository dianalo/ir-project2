The transaction would mark the third giant order forBoeing Co. from Asia in the past few weeks, underscoring therapid growth in that market.</LP><TEXT>   Seattle-based Boeing, the world's leading commercialairplane maker, has scheduled a news conference for 11 a.m.in Washington, D.C., to mark the signing.   In addition to the attendance of Boeing Chairman FrankShrontz and C.H. Cho, a senior executive vice president ofKorean Airlines, lawmakers also have been invited, a signalthat the South Koreans hope will show that they're continuingto try and reduce the U.S.'s merchandise trade deficit withtheir country. The deficit, according to Commerce Departmentfigures, stood at $6.3 billion at the end of 1989.   Boeing declined to disclose what kinds of planes KoreanAirlines will purchase, but an official at the carrier saidit will make 12 firm orders for 747-400s, as well as 11&quot;re-confirmations&quot; for the four-engine aircraft. Are-confirmation gives Korean Airlines the right to cancel ata future date, but it is considered more of a commitment thantaking out options. Deliveries are planned to begin in 1991.   Sources close to the transaction cautioned that thenumbers could slightly change before the contract signing.   The airline executive said Korean Airlines will pay about$170 million each for the 747s, adjusted for inflation.   The official said that Korean Airlines also consideredAirbus Industrie's A-330 planes, but he said the Boeingaircraft &quot;are particularly suited&quot; for trans-Pacific andEuropean routes. Airbus's A-330s also won't be ready untilseveral years after the Boeing planes are available.   It wasn't immediately clear which of the world'sjet-engine manufacturers -- General Electric Co., Rolls-RoycePLC or United Technologies Corp.'s Pratt andamp; Whitney unit --will power the planes. An engine order often lags an aircraftorder. Pratt andamp; Whitney, though, has been named the supplierfor nine other 747-400s bought in the past by KoreanAirlines.   The Korean Airlines order -- which follows a $2 billiondeal with China's Civil Aviation Administration and a $3.1billion booking for 747-400s for Japan Airlines -- couldboost Boeing's stock price.   The stock hit a 52-week high last Monday at $87. Itslumped later in the week, closing Friday in New York StockExchange composite trading at $82.50, off $1.375.   Judith Comeau, aerospace analyst for Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co.,attributed the fall to profit-taking, noting that a number ofother blue-chips have suffered a similar fate over the pastfew days. But she believes there is plenty of upsidepotential left in the stock. &quot;It is much too early to sellBoeing,&quot; she said.   Ms. Comeau pointed out that the 747-400 is a particularlyhot commodity right now. She said she recently visited AMRCorp.'s American Airlines unit, for instance, where officialsare struggling to find a leasing company or another sourcethat can provide six 747s. &quot;They can't get them anywhere,&quot;she said, explaining that they'll &quot;probably have to settlefor&quot; smaller McDonnell Douglas MD-11 trijets.   The demand for the 747 is particularly acute in thePacific Rim. Boeing's own forecast is that air traffic toAsia from North America and Europe will soar 9% annuallythrough the next decade. Within Asia, air traffic is expectedto surge over the same period almost 8%, and within the U.S.only 5.2%.</TEXT></DOC>
