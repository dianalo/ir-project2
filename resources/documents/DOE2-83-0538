The objective of this article is to examine the applicability,suitability, and significance of existing and new methods for detectingand monitoring the recombinant genes or organisms introduced into theenvironment. Conventional microbiological method(s) involving the selectiveand differential growth of microorganism(s) and other quantitative approachessuch as the most-probable-number (MPN) method and direct microscopicobservation (e.g., acridine orange direct count analysis) have drawbacksand are not specific or universally applicable. Direct enumeration byimmunofluorescence by the use of fluorescent dye seems more sensitivealthough still not perfect. However, the molecular methodologies suchas the use of gene probes, plasmid epidemiology, antibiotic resistantmarker strains, and protein electrophoresis and bacteriophage sensitivityare receiving more attention. As yet, the technology of DNA:DNA hybridizationappears to be very useful, sensitive, and accurate for detecting andmonitoring the microorganisms in the environment, although improvementsare required. New approaches can be developed which may include biochemicalsignature compounds as well as gene cassettes to be used in a complementaryfashion with conventional and molecular techniques for quantifying specificgenotypes and genes in the environment. 239 references.</TEXT></DOC>
