Many say they are &quot;living with AIDS&quot; rather than dying of it. Calling themselves &quot;people with AIDS&quot; instead of &quot;AIDS victims,&quot; many are actively trying to help others.    &quot;I would rather feel there were people fighting along with me than be at home suffering alone,&quot; says Scott James Jordan, 26, whose illness was diagnosed two years ago. Today, he still works full time in a video store and volunteers 10 hours a week at the Gay Men's Health Crisis.    Since his diagnosis, Mr. Jordan has suffered one crisis after another. The manager of a Greenwich Village bakery fired him because he says he couldn't have a person with AIDS in the shop. &quot;He said he felt really bad about it and offered me $40,&quot; Mr. Jordan recalls. He says his former landlady tried unsuccessfully to evict him and his roommates. The roommates, fearing a second attempt, asked Mr. Jordan to move out, he says.    After a hospital stay in which he lost 50 pounds that he has since regained, Mr. Jordan moved to his father's house in Connecticut. There, he says: &quot;I spent a lot of time sitting in a chair waiting to die. I noticed my dishes got a lot of washing.&quot;    On returning to New York to live with friends, Mr. Jordan turned to GMHC for help but ended up volunteering himself. &quot;The worst thing you can do is isolate yourself and do nothing,&quot; he says. &quot;I have my periods of depression, but for the most part I am happy. All I used to do was party. Now I can go to bed every night feeling I have done all I can to help other people.&quot;    Many are turning to the People With AIDS Coalition in the Village. Staffed by 37 volunteers with AIDS or AIDS-related complex, the group says it provides services to more than 800 people a month and distributes a newsletter to many more.    The organization has faced its trials, too. According to Michael Hirsch, who is the executive director and the only staff member who doesn't have AIDS, about 60% of the original directors have died since the group was founded less than two years ago. Mr. Hirsch says the group looked at more than 40 offices, mostly in the Village and nearby Chelsea, without finding one owner who was willing to rent.    An Episcopal church offered to rent space in the building next door. But when an office-copier repairman realized that the building was full of people with AIDS, he &quot;fled so fast, he left his toolbox behind,&quot; Mr. Hirsch says.    Self-help programs can't solve all the devastating practical problems that men and women with AIDS face. Griffin Gold, the president of the PWA Coalition, says lack of strength forced him to give up his job as a real-estate appraiser. Meanwhile, he piled up several thousand dollars in medical bills and only recently got approval for federal disability payments of just over $400 a month. (He has AIDS-related complex.) He says he is behind in his rent, and his landlord has sued to evict him.    &quot;I didn't expect to outlive my savings,&quot; he says. &quot;Now, I eat a lot of rice. I live almost entirely off the generosity of my friends. I am now absolutely, positively destitute.&quot;    Mr. Gold says that when he was diagnosed, he felt &quot;very, very frightened and alone&quot; and went to a support group. &quot;I saw a lot of faces I recognized, and I got involved. I know that someone who is diagnosed now has it just a little easier because of the work I have done. It is absolutely essential for us to band together.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
