The idea has been a centerpiece of Vice President George Bush's presidential campaign, and Mr. Bush's staff has supported its inclusion in the budget. The proposal is also backed by the Education Department and has been endorsed by White House Budget Director James Miller, administration officials said.    According to rough estimates by the administration, the plan would cost the government between $175 million and $355 million annually in lost tax revenues over the next few years. In the long term, the annual cost could rise to more than $1 billion. &quot;It will have a certain tax cost,&quot; acknowledged an education official. &quot;The question is: Is it worth it?&quot;    The plan would principally benefit middle-income and upper-income families with high tax rates, although administration officials said they are considering ways to deny the tax break to the very wealthy.    Variations of the plan have been proposed by Kansas Sen. Robert Dole, Mr. Bush's opponent for the GOP presidential nomination, and by Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts.    The proposal isn't yet final and could be dropped from the budget if opposed by Treasury Secretary James Baker. But Mr. Baker is a friend and adviser to the vice president and is likely to support Mr. Bush's wishes.    &quot;If the vice president wants it, it will be in,&quot; one administration official said.    &quot;We've recommended this for implementation as soon as it is practical,&quot; said a Bush staffer. &quot;We'll accept credit anytime, either in this administration or the next.&quot;    Under the plan, a family could buy Series E U.S. savings bonds and pay no taxes on the interest earned, provided the money is used to finance college expenses. Because U.S. savings bonds earn less interest than other Treasury securities, the government would save money in interest costs because it would be able to finance a greater portion of its debt through savings bonds. But the savings would be more than offset by lost tax revenue.    The education proposal is the first indication that Vice President Bush is trying to put his imprint on the budget proposal for the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1. But administration budget officials said other proposals by Mr. Bush, such as a reduction in the tax rate on capital gains, almost certainly won't be in the budget.    Separately, Budget Director Miller sent a letter to congressional leaders yesterday notifying them that the administration won't meet the law's requirement that a budget be submitted by the first Monday in January. Instead, the White House plans to submit its budget on Feb. 18. Mr. Miller said the postponement was made necessary by congressional delays in enacting the fiscal 1988 tax and spending bills.    Many families use savings bonds to finance college tuition, since taxes may be deferred until the bond is cashed in. The new plan would make that strategy more attractive, by eliminating all taxes if the principal and interest on the bond are used to finance educational expenses.    Administration budget officials haven't yet decided whether the new tax break would apply to savings bonds that have already been sold, or only to savings bonds sold after the proposal is enacted.    Series E savings bonds pay interest equal to only 85% of the average market yield on five-year Treasury bills, with a guaranteed minimum interest rate of 6%. As a result, families in low tax brackets may fare better by purchasing taxable Treasury securities, rather than the proposed tax-savings bonds. The plan's benefits could be substantial, however, for families with high tax rates.    The new plan marks a reversal for the Reagan administration, which has generally opposed new education programs. </TEXT></DOC>
