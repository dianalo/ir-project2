The report by Chaktawar Lentin, a retired Bombay High Courtjudge, also criticized what it called widespread corruption amonggovernment officials responsible for overseeing health care and thepharmaceutical industry.   Lentin, whose report was submitted to the Maharashtra stateassembly Wednesday by the current state health minister, Ram Meghe,recommended criminal investigations of Bhai Sawant and BaliramHiray, two former health ministers.   Lentin's report said the two were ``guilty of corruption, misuseof ministerial power and authority, dereliction of duty and (were)unfit to hold a ministerial post.''   Sawant told the assembly he denied the allegations.   Meghe announced that inquiries would be held.   The state government set up the commission following the deathsof 14 patients at the J.J. Hospital in Bombay after they were givencontaminated glycerine in January and February 1986.   Lentin's report was completed nearly four months ago but hisfindings were not made public until this week.   Critics have charged that the state government's decision not torelease the report until Wednesday encouraged slipshod work inIndia's drug companies.   Lentin said that the medication linked to the deaths of the 14hospital patients had been mixed with the lethal diethylene glycol.It was manufactured at the Alpana Pharma Company located in Nanded,a town in Maharashtra.   The commission also said it found corruption among seniorofficials of the government's Food and Drug Administration. Thereport said that inquiries should be held into the behavior of foursenior officials of the agency.   ``The entire structure of the (agency) has been corroded byrampant and unabashed corruption, indiscipline, naked favoritism,crude nepotism and gross ministerial interference at every stageand a sense of non-accountability all around,'' Lentin said in hisreport.   The state government announced the suspension of four doctors atthe J.J. Hospital on recommendation of the commission. Charges willalso be filed against four drug manufacturing companies.</TEXT></DOC>
