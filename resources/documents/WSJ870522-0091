At a signing ceremony, Mr. Reagan said the legislation &quot;promotes efficient production and development of our energy resources by returning fuel choices to the marketplace.&quot;    The new law also ends the federal requirement that industrial users, rather than residential customers, pay the bulk of natural-gas price increases. Mr. Reagan said that requirement &quot;distorted supply and demand and raised energy prices paid by consumers and industry.&quot;    The gas industry welcomed the measure. George Lawrence, president of the American Gas Association, said, &quot;For the first time in a heck of a long time we don't have any restraints&quot; on gas demand. The gas industry is particularly optimistic about the growth prospects for high-efficiency gas turbines that produce electricity. Mr. Lawrence called it &quot;a premium, priority market that we'll be going after.&quot;    The gas association predicts the law will add about 2.5 trillion cubic feet to annual U.S. gas demand by the turn of the century, an increase of more than 15% from current use.    At his signing ceremony, Mr. Reagan called for Congress to go on to decontrol natural-gas prices and require pipelines to transport gas for anyone. But congressional leaders say such action is highly unlikely in this session. </TEXT></DOC>
