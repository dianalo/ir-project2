Profit for the fourth quarter ended March 27 rose to about $190,000, or 10 cents a share, from $116,000, or 10 cents a share, a year earlier. Kent, which went public last June, had 1.9 million shares outstanding in the latest quarter, compared with 1.2 million a year earlier.    Kent -- a distributor of wiring, cable and related products and a custom manufacturer of electronic components -- said revenue for the period jumped 46% to $5.1 million from $3.5 million a year earlier.    Morrie K. Abramson, chairman and chief executive officer, said in an interview that for the year, Kent expects to report earnings rose 46% to a record $600,000, or 35 cents a share, from $410,000, or 35 cents a share, a year earlier. Average shares outstanding for the year totaled 1.7 million compared with 1.2 million.    Revenue for the full year climbed about 23% to more than $18 million from $14.7 million.    Mr. Abramson attributed the higher earnings to improved operating efficiency, including the automation of certain manufacturing operations to cut labor costs. Mr. Abramson said Kent's strong performance also was fueled by a significant increase in manufacturing contracts, which accounted for about 30% of total revenue, compared with 20% a year earlier. The distribution segment represents the remainder of Kent's business.    The company added that it is discussing the possibility of acquiring companies with similar operations. Specific candidates weren't named. </TEXT></DOC>
