(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>A New LAN Standard Lights the WayandM;From the basic description, you'd think FDDI was a Cecil B. deMille movie:seven years in the making, anxiously awaited by thousands and coming soon toa stage near you.andP;  Although it's not likely to create the same stir as TheTen Commandments or be The Greatest Show on Earth, FDDI--the FiberDistributed Data Interface standard--certainly will add drama to a marketlong starved for a high-speed local area network communications standard.andM;FDDI was designed within the American National Standards Institute (ANSI)Committee X3T9.5 by several dozen participating computer andtelecommunications companies.andP;  This alone makes FDDI special because it's thefirst mainstream local area network (LAN) standard that was developed by theindustry as a whole.andP;  In contrast, other ANSI LAN standards, such as Ethernet(802.3) and Token Ring (802.5) were developed by vendors and adopted asstandards by ANSI because of their widespread implementation in the field.andM;FDDI products are barely out of the box, and already the standard has thesupport of more than 80 leading telecommunications and computer companiesworldwide.andP;  Furthermore, say analysts, the FDDI standard has strong userappeal.andP;  In order for a proprietary LAN solution to beat out FDDI, there willhave to be a compelling reason.andM;Yet a few nagging questions remain, particularly concerning the role FDDIwill play in most organizations and the length of time it will last in themarketplace.andP;  FDDI, after all, has already taken a long time to reach users.andO;Is it already outdated or does it have a big role to play--and where?andM;FDDI BasicsandM;FDDI uses a token-passing access scheme on optical fiber media to achieve aspeed of 100 megabits per second (Mbps), which is an order of magnitudefaster than Ethernet's speed of 10Mbps.andP;  FDDI also has network stationmanagement capabilities baked right into the protocol, which is viewed as acritical benefit to companies that function in a multivendor environment.andM;The FDDI standard itself has four components: Physical (PHY), which describesthe physical connectors and cables; Physical Media Dependent (PMD), whichdescribes the link protocol; Media Access Control (MAC), which describes thepeer-to-peer protocol between nodes; and Station Management (SMT), which isthe network management component.andM;The PHY, PMD and MAC specifications are already complete.andP;  The SMT componentis in draft form and is expected to be completed by early 1991.andP;  Vendors,however, already have products on the market that they say adhere to the SMTdraft specification and will be upgraded to the final specification.andO;Synernetics Inc., an FDDI supplier in Billerica, Mass., recently announcedformation of the SMT Development Forum to encourage a uniform implementationof the SMT specification.andM;When added together, the four components of FDDI map into the first twolayers of the seven-layer Open Systems Interconnection Reference Model,although many people say that the MAC component has some of the intelligencethat is normally associated with OSI's third layer.andM;With OSI support behind it, FDDI seems poised for ready market acceptance.andO;&quot;FDDI is a great deal for end users and the component manufacturers,&quot; saysKenneth Bosomworth, president of International Resource Development Inc., amarket research firm in New Caanan, Conn.andP;  Yet LAN vendors' success atcapitalizing on FDDI remains uncertain.andP;  According to Bosomworth, FDDI willcreate a &quot;dog eat dog market based on price&quot; for LAN vendors because most ofthe value will be supplied by chip and opto-electronics suppliers.andP;  Thisleaves little room for LAN suppliers to differentiate their products.andM;The Building MomentumandM;Although relatively few end-user products have been shipped, momentum for theFDDI market is starting to build rapidly.andP;  Advanced Micro Devices Inc. ofSunnyvale, Calif., which so far has developed the only FDDI chip set on themarket, is leading the charge.andP;  In July 1989, AMD established the AdvancedNetworking Group among LAN developers and vendors.andM;The purpose of the group, says John Jaeger, product marketing manager forAMD's FDDI Supernet chip set, is to promote FDDI in the marketplace and tohelp vendors establish interoperability among different products, so that LANnodes from a variety of vendors will all work together in a singleinstallation.andM;According to Jaeger, there are now about 80 members of the AdvancedNetworking Group.andP;  The list reads like a Who's Who of the computer networkingand telecommunications industry and includes giants such as ATandamp;T,Hewlett-Packard Co., Sun Microsystems Inc., Sony Corp. of America, ToshibaAmerica Inc., Unisys Corp. and Wang Laboratories Inc., along with severaldozen LAN vendors and component suppliers.andM;Conspicuously missing from the list are Digital Equipment Corp. and IBM,although not being on the list does not necessarily signal a lack of companysupport for FDDI.andP;  Digital, for example, has already announced an FDDIproduct and has developed very large scale integrated circuits (VLSICs) forFDDI that it licensed AMD to manufacture for the general market.andP;  WilliamJohnson, Digital's vice president of Distributed Systems, furthermore, hasannounced his firm's public support for FDDI.andM;IBM has made no announcements and doesn't comment on unannounced products.andO;Yet Big Blue has publicly signed deals with Cisco Systems Inc. of Menlo Park,Calif.; Communication Machinery Corp. of Santa Barbara, Calif.; FiberCom Inc.andO;of Roanoke, Va.; and Wellfleet Communications Inc. of Bedford, Mass.andP;  Each ofthese companies is expected to play an important role in the FDDImarketplace.andP;  Furthermore, IBM has said it is looking at FDDI and otherhigh-speed LANs in its research laboratories in Raleigh, N.C., and Zurich,Switzerland.andM;Leader of the PackandM;Although a number of vendors have announced new FDDI products and several areshipping products now, the acknowledged leader of the pack today is Hyannis,Mass.-based Fibronics International Inc., which can lay claim to 80 to 90% ofthe current installed base.andM;A Fibronics spokesman says the firm has 900 FDDI nodes installed in 70companies worldwide.andP;  Installations include Argonne National Laboratory,Coors Brewing Co., General Motors Corp., Italian Autostrade, Martin MariettaCorp., Mitsubishi International, NASA Langley Research Center and TRW Inc.andM;Italian Autostrade, the government agency in charge of Italy's nationalhighway system, has an application that shows the potential value of FDDI'sincreased speed of 100Mbps--automated toll booths that can capture billingdata while cars pass by at about 30 miles per hour.andM;FDDI Takes Its TollandM;The toll booths are connected via an FDDI backbone LAN directly to amainframe computer.andP;  Drivers install a small box on the car's visor thatsends credit card data via radio signals to the toll booth as the car passesby.andP;  The data are then posted to a central database at high speed.andP;  FDDI wasrequired, according to a Fibronics spokesman, so that the mainframe doesn'tmiss a transaction.andM;Although Italian Autostrade's may be an exotic application, FDDI's bread andbutter installations will be far more mundane.andP;  FDDIandM;is viewed by virtually everyone in the market as the coming standard forcorporate LAN backbones.andM;The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Langley ResearchCenter, a research and development arm of the government space organizationbased in Hampton, Va., is an example of how FDDI is likely to operate as abackbone.andP;  Ed Riddle, the head of the Communications and Network SystemsBranch at NASA Langley, says he is pleased with FDDI technology.andP;  &quot;We feelvery good about its future.&quot;andM;NASA Langley is a campus environment that comprises 100 buildings on foursquare miles.andP;  In 1985, says Riddle, 50 Ethernet LANs were installed and wereinterconnected via a 10Mbps Pronet 10 backbone network from Proteon Inc. ofWestborough, Mass.andM;As the Pronet 10 backbone became saturated with traffic and requiredupdating, Riddle says he compared a nonstandard solution--the newer 80MbpsPronet 80 from Proteon--with the FX8210 FDDI LAN from Fibronics.andP;  Riddle'sfirm then purchased a Fibronics backbone to link two Ethernet LANs in NASALangley's test lab and followed this with another FDDI backbone purchase toconnect two more Ethernet LANs in a working field trial.andM;&quot;We were surprised at how well it works,&quot; says Riddle.andP;  &quot;[FDDI] is ideal fora backbone to interface our different Ethernet LANs.&quot;andP;  The fact that FDDI wasa standard solution was &quot;highly significant,&quot; Riddle says, because it gavehim hardware flexibility.andP;  However, he is still waiting for Fibronics todevelop some additional network management software that will further enhancethe backbone.andM;Network Management Is KeyandM;The unique architecture of LANs provides special advantages for passivenetwork management at a modest price.andP;  On most LANs, data pass by everystation.andP;  By simply putting software on any computer on the LAN, traffic canbe passively monitored as it passes by.andM;When a backbone LAN is installed, network monitoring can be extended acrossevery individual network on the system.andP;  (Individual networks are referred toas either &quot;subnetworks&quot; or &quot;front-end&quot; networks.)andP;  This is accomplished byputting monitoring software in the bridge between the subnetwork and thebackbone.andM;Because the bridge is connected on one side to the subnetwork and on theother side to the backbone, it can monitor activity on the subnetwork andpass the information to a single network management station residing on thebackbone itself or on any subnetwork within the overall network.andP;  Monitoringeach subnetwork in this fashion makes it easier to expand the capacity ofsubnetworks and the backbone gracefully.andM;Right now, Riddle is waiting for Fibronics to deliver the ability to monitortraffic on his subnetwork Ethernet LANs before he commits to installing FDDIas the backbone for all NASA Langley's Ethernet LANs.andM;Riddle's experience at the NASA Langley installation gets to the heart of animportant issue: How far does the FDDI standard reach?andP;  In theory, FDDI'sstation management capabilities allow active network management.andP;  This meansthat it is possible to track network use and query the status of every FDDInode on the network, which is important in determining the location ofspecific faults.andP;  But SMT does not readily extend itself to other LANs, suchas AppleTalk, Ethernet or Token Ring.andP;  In essence, users will still require aproprietary network management scheme, such as the pending Fibronicssolution, to track the status of all subnetwork LANs.andM;A Potential GlitchandM;This seemingly tiny hole in the FDDI standard adds a potential glitch to itsvalue as a standard for corporate backbones.andP;  By using custom software froman FDDI vendor to provide any important feature, an end user couldinadvertently end up locked to that one supplier.andM;Riddle say that, although the issue of monitoring his subnetworks isimportant, this current FDDI shortcoming is not enough to keep him from usingthe new standard.andP;  &quot;I don't want to accidentally negate the value of thestandard and also don't want to get locked into a single vendor,&quot; he says.andO;&quot;We'll have to hope that we get standard NMS [network management system]software as the market develops.&quot;andM;A standard solution may not be too far off.andP;  &quot;Once FDDI gets going as acorporate backbone,&quot; says Information Resource Development's Bosomworth,&quot;enterprising people will figure out how to extend its managementcapabilities.andP;  Over the short term, we'll probably see third-party softwarethat extends SMT into Ethernet and other LANs.andP;  Over the long term, we maysee SMT become a part of both Ethernet and Token Ring, as well.&quot;andM;On the Front LinesandM;Although most analysts expect FDDI to become the standard for LAN backbones,there is considerable controversy about another role that FDDI is expected toplay--linking high-speed graphics workstations and minicomputers ormainframes directly together at 100Mbps.andM;The leading workstation companies--including Apollo Computer Inc., Digital,Hewlett-Packard and Sun Microsystems--are expected to ship FDDI products thisyear.andP;  We can also assume that FDDI is in the cards for IBM's hot newworkstation, the RISC System/6000.andM;The problem is that a number of observers don't believe FDDI has enoughhorsepower to meet all the demands of graphics workstations.andP;  According toFrank Dzubeck, president of Communications Network Architects Inc. aconsulting firm in Washington, D.C., FDDI cannot adequately service high-endworkstations that process rotating 3-D graphics.andP;  To do this properly,Dzubeck claims, a minimum of 148Mbps bandwidth is required; otherwiseworkstation performance degrades.andM;Tim Kuhfuss, an assistant computer scientist at Argonne National Laboratoryin Argonne, Ill., agrees.andP;  Kuhfuss, who is testing FDDI, says, &quot;A number ofour researchers have said they'll need something like a gigabit forapplications such as scientific visualization of images.&quot;andM;Still, Dzubeck and Kuhfuss also agree that, while FDDI won't meet every need,it will certainly address the needs of many users.andP;  Dzubeck expects to seehigher speed proprietary LANs that will meet the limited demand not met byFDDI.andP;  These higher speed LANs, he says, will be linked to an FDDI backboneand will simply slow down when graphics have to be transferred across thebackbone.andM;Watch Your WalletandM;Although most problems people seem to have with FDDI lie at its periphery,one problem cuts to the core: price.andP;  Today, a typical FDDI node sits in the$10,000 range, which is pricey even for a backbone.andP;  Fortunately, everyoneexpects the price to drop rapidly when new products flood the market laterthis year.andM;John Jaeger from AMD expects the price of backbone connections to fall atleast to the $4,000-to-$6,000 range within a year, and possibly down to the$3,000-to-$4,000 range.andP;  By 1993, Jaeger expects that connections will bepriced in the $2,000-to-$3,000 range and by 1995 will be under $1,000.andM;&quot;The price makes a big difference,&quot; says Kuhfuss, although he couldn't sayprecisely what price would justify FDDI because different applications havedifferent cost justifications.andP;  But, he says, once FDDI reaches below $3,000for an interconnection to a backbone or to a workstation the standard willbecome &quot;very attractive.&quot;andM;The bottom line on FDDI is that after seven years of development bycommittee, this is the first year in which FDDI will become an operatingreality.andP;  Despite a major push from vendors, there are serious questionregarding how far FDDI will be able to go in the marketplace.andM;How far and for how long FDDI will meet the needs for graphics workstationsis a big question that cannot be answered until products reach consumers.andO;It's even more uncertain whether business users will replace their front-endEthernet, ARCnet and AppleTalk LANs with FDDI.andP;  To do so will require notonly pulling fiber to every desktop but also making a substantial investmentin every workstation in the form of new interface boards.andP;  For these reasonsalone, FDDI may never advance much beyond being a backbone.andM;So FDDI is not going to be everything to everybody.andP;  &quot;FDDI does not exciteus,&quot; maintains John Leong, networking director at Carnegie Mellon Universityin Pittsburgh.andP;  &quot;An order of magnitude increase from 10Mbps to 100Mbps atthis point in time is just not exciting.&quot;andP;  But with dozens of companiesreadying products for something that has the ANSI seal of approval, it's asafe bet that FDDI is going to play a huge role in the future of corporateLAN backbones and a significant one for front-end LANs that need more oomphthan Ethernet.andM;Stephen A. Caswell has more than 15 years' experience writing about datacommunications.andP;  He is based in Westlake Village, Calif.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
