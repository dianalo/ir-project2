The trade figure for May will be released by the Commerce Department this morning. Although many analysts expect a slight widening from the $13.3 billion deficit reported for April, a rumor swept through the markets yesterday that the gap was only $11 billion.    That helped lift bonds out of an early morning slump. Actively traded 30-year Treasury bonds wound up with gains of about three-eighths of a point, or $3.75 for each $1,000 face amount. Corporate and municipal bonds also climbed. The rally also was buoyed by an unexpectedly large drop in the federal funds rate, the rate on reserves banks lend each other overnight.    According to the average forecast of 15 economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets report, the trade deficit widened slightly to $13.6 billion in May. Despite the rumored $11 billion gap, economists' estimates ranged between $12.5 billion and $15.8 billion.    &quot;A $13 billion deficit will be a bit of a disappointment now that $11 billion already is in the market,&quot; said Peter Hegel, who helps manage about $6.5 billion for Lisle, Ill.-based Van Kampen, Merritt Inc., an investment banking concern.    Keith Jarrett, chief economist of Technical Data International, agreed. &quot;The market is setting itself up for a possible fall unless we get a substantial improvement&quot; in the trade deficit, he said. Mr. Jarrett dismissed the rumors as &quot;over-optimistic.&quot;    Rumors about the trade figures are nothing new -- and rarely accurate. Many analysts say the numbers often jolt the markets because the statistics are very difficult to predict and also are subject to large revisions.    In mid-April, for example, the bond and stock markets were rocked by a rumor that the trade gap had soared to about $18 billion in February. The Commerce Department the following day said the actual number for February was $15.06 billion. Treasury bond prices initially slumped further on the news but later rebounded to wind up that day with small declines.    Whatever the case, Mr. Hegel said bond prices likely &quot;will remain in a trading range,&quot; with yields on 30-year government issues, now about 8 1/2%, &quot;drifting between a floor of 8% and a ceiling of 9%. I'm bullish short-term, but later this year I see higher interest rates.&quot;    Also to be reported this morning is industrial production for June. According to the median estimate of 44 analysts surveyed by Money Market Services Inc. of Redwood City, Calif., the report will show industrial production rose only 0.2% last month. That would compare with a 0.5% gain in May. Individual estimates vary widely, ranging from a decline of 0.1% to an increase of 0.4%, said John Lilley, an economist at Money Market Services.    The Treasury's 8 3/4% bonds due 2017, which fell to as low as 101 26/32 early yesterday, later rebounded to wind up the session at 102 19/32, a rise from 102 7/32 Monday. The yield declined to 8.51% from 8.54%. The government's 8 1/2% notes due 1997 rose to 101 5/32 from 100 26/32 as the yield fell to 8.32% from 8.37%.    An index of long-term Treasury bonds compiled by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. rose 4.99 points to 1298.08, closing the session just below its high for the day of 1298.37. The low for the day was 1289.24.    Among short-term interest rates, the latest three-month Treasury bill rate edged higher to 5.56% bid from an average rate of 5.55% set at Monday's auction. The latest six-month Treasury bill rate declined slightly to 5.53% bid from an auction average of 5.54%.    The federal funds rate fell to 6% late yesterday and averaged about 6 3/8% for the day, according to an estimate by Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.) Inc. During the first three weeks in June, the funds rate averaged about 6 3/4%.    The drop in the funds rate, coupled with the fact that the Federal Reserve once again didn't intervene to push the rate back up, has convinced many analysts that the Fed has eased credit. &quot;It's clear the Fed has eased a little bit,&quot; said Mr. Jarrett. &quot;They didn't come in and drain reserves as some people had expected.&quot;    But others remain unconvinced. &quot;I still think the odds are that the Fed hasn't eased in spite of what we've seen on the funds rate,&quot; said Raymond Stone, chief financial economist at Merrill Lynch Economics Inc. &quot;I realize, though, that I'm in the minority.&quot;    Speculation continues that banks may lower their prime lending rates to 8% from 8 1/4% soon. Banks' borrowing costs have been falling in recent weeks, while business loan demand has been sluggish. But several bankers contend that their borrowing costs haven't declined enough yet to justify a lower prime, or base, rate on corporate loans.    As the federal funds rate has fallen, so has the broker-loan rate, which is the rate that banks charge on loans backed by stock. U.S. Trust Co. yesterday lowered its broker loan rate to 7.75% from 8%.    The Fed's policy-making committee held a two-day meeting last week to review its credit strategy and money supply targets. A Fed official is expected to disclose the central bank's money targets and economic projections at a congressional hearing next week.    But a Fed spokesman yesterday said &quot;it hasn't been decided&quot; which Fed official will testify, or when. In the past, Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker has represented the central bank on such occasions. Mr. Volcker's term as chairman expires early next month. President Reagan has nominated Alan Greenspan as his successor.    The Fed's unusually lengthy delay in announcing who will testify, and when, is &quot;very puzzling,&quot; said Maria Fiorini Ramirez, managing director and money market economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. This view was echoed by several other analysts who had expected Mr. Volcker to testify even though he will be leaving the Fed shortly. If Mr. Volcker doesn't testify, Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson is likely to take his place, some analysts said. The Fed spokesman declined to comment.    Underwriters reported mostly sluggish sales for yesterday's slate of new corporate offerings. &quot;Let's put it this way, there are still bonds available,&quot; said an official at First Boston Corp. The bonds included:    --$500 million of collateralized mortgage obligations issued by Salomon Brothers Inc. Underwriters led by Salomon Brothers priced the CMOs with yields ranging from 8.45% on securities with a 2.3-year average life to 10.57% on securities with an 18.8-year average life. The yields were between 1.15 percentage points and 1.9 percentage points greater than Treasury bonds with similar maturities. The offering, rated triple-A by Standard andamp; Poor's Corp., includes floating-rate notes priced to yield 0.6 percentage point more than the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, for three-month Eurodollar deposits.    --$150 million of Bank of Boston Corp. subordinated capital notes due August 1997. Underwriters led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets priced the notes at par to yield 9.5%, or 1.14 percentage points more than the Treasury's 10-year note. The notes are rated single-A-1 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and double-A-minus by Sandamp;P.    --$125 million of Ecolab Inc. sinking fund debentures due July 2017. Underwriters led by First Boston priced the debentures at par to yield 10.375%, or 1.83 percentage points more than the Treasury's 8 3/4% bonds due 2017. The debentures are rated Baa-1 by Moody's and triple-B by Sandamp;P.    In the municipal market, $56.7 million of Mississippi general obligation bonds were offered to investors. Underwriters led by Chase Manhattan Capital Markets Corp. priced the issue after auction to yield from 4% on bonds due 1988 to 7.5% on bonds due 2006 and 2007. The offering is rated double-A by Moody's and double-A-minus by Sandamp;P. The unsold balance: about $18.7 million. </TEXT></DOC>
