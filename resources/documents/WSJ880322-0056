Statements from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries -- which many analysts say has reasons for wanting prices to gyrate -- fueled the rise and fall. North Sea Brent in Europe was up 50 cents, to $15.40 a barrel. But on the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate closed at $16.50 a barrel, after earlier trading as high as $17.03.    The strong opening came on speculation on what OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman of Nigeria will say at a news conference today, as well as on statements by Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer that OPEC is discussing supply issues with nonOPEC members, a break with tradition. But another development, the ouster of Indonesian Oil Minister Subroto in a cabinet shake-up, was a &quot;non-factor&quot; on prices, said Richard D. Donovan, head of the international-energy desk at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., New York.    Mr. Lukman has said he will announce at the news conference measures to stabilize prices; prices were driven up as traders speculated he might announce a much-anticipated OPEC emergency meeting. However, market sources strongly discount that the news conference will yield anything as important as a meeting. It is understood Mr. Lukman will disclose new production numbers, at most.    Even so, prices soared until Saudi King Fahd in an official statement yesterday afternoon confirmed for the first time that his kingdom has been selling oil at discount prices. The statement &quot;really gave this market a kick in the face,&quot; one trader told Dow Jones International Petroleum Report, a news wire.    What apparently has frightened the Saudis, analysts said, is that a lack of buyers caused the kingdom's output for the second week of March to be 3.6 million barrels daily, well under its OPEC quota of 4.3 million barrels. &quot;So they said, 'This is no good. Let's give discounts to everybody and his mother,'&quot; said one analyst.    Analysts puzzled over why Mr. Nazer made price-supporting statements early in the day, while his king made such a negative statement later. Some say Saudi Arabia might relish volatility to make it difficult for U.S. oil companies to do long-term planning, thus keeping new exploration in check and giving OPEC more leverage.    In other commodity markets yesterday:   PRECIOUS METALS: Gold, silver and platinum prices rose sharply in response to statistics and other indications the economy is expanding faster than predicted. Another factor was the surge in oil prices, which spurred further talk of possible accelerating inflation. The talk -- which some analysts derided as &quot;inflation paranoia&quot;helped gold on the Commodity Exchange in New York rise $4.90 an ounce, to $449.20, in heavy trading. Comex silver rose 8.2 cents an ounce, to $6.447. Platinum on the New York Mercantile Exchange finished $6.90 an ounce higher at $502.70. Steven Pepper, senior vice president and gold trader for Republic National Bank, New York, said prices were also boosted by &quot;a good bout of short covering&quot; -- traders buying contracts to offset earlier sales.    GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Corn and soybean prices finished higher. Much of the trading was fueled again by Candamp;D Commodities, a major speculator in the grain pits. &quot;It was a good day. You can thank or blame Candamp;D,&quot; said one trader. Soybean prices for May settlement closed at $6.3775 a bushel, up 7.25 cents. Meal prices were lifted on speculation that the Soviets may have purchased meal from Brazil. &quot;The rumor of the meal purchases lent some support because if (the rumor is) correct it means (the Soviets are) back in the market for meal,&quot; said Victor Lespinasse, a floor broker with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., Chicago. Corn prices responded to the Agriculture Department's announcement late Friday that the Soviets had purchased 500,000 metric tons of corn and fulfilled the minimum purchase requirement of four million tons under the current grain agreement. Wheat futures closed lower.    COFFEE: Prices fell one cent, to $1.315 a pound, on New York's Coffee, Sugar andamp; Cocoa Exchange. Early this year, coffee futures rallied 10 cents a pound and had some analysts predicting prices of $1.60. Instead, the 10-cent gain has been given back. Concerns about a lack of top-quality beans have dissipated and demand has fallen with the onset of spring, said Sandra Kaul, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., New York. When prices were rising, some coffee companies increased retail prices; when the increases hit consumers in coming weeks, demand may go even lower, Ms. Kaul said.    INTEREST RATES: Bellwether Treasury-bond futures for June settlement fell nearly a full point during the day before rebounding in late trading to close at 90 23/32, down 5/16. The initial decline was fueled by renewed inflation fears and rising oil and oil-futures prices, said Jeffrey Priest, head fixed-income trader for Miller, Tabak, Hirsch andamp; Co., New York. As oil futures gave up some of their gains, Treasury-bond futures bounced off their lows for the day. The decline on inflation fears came despite recent consumer and producer price index figures that didn't show any sharp increase in inflation. </TEXT></DOC>
