In the Drexel case, he said,the SEC is ``attempting to find those people in the industry who donot fit the mold of the industry itself.''   Ruder defended Wall Street when asked by Rep. Edward J. Markey,D-Mass., chairman of the House Commerce subcommittee on finance,whether the Drexel allegations reflect widespread abuse or whetherthe problem is confined to a few companies.   ``These allegations, if true, represent a blistering, scaldingcommentary on the culture of Wall Street in the 1980s,'' Markeysaid.   In a suit filed Wednesday in federal court in New York, the SECaccused Drexel; Michael Milken, the firm's executive vicepresident; and three other Drexel employees of violating securitieslaws, including prohibitions against insider trading, stockmanipulation and defrauding clients.   Drexel has denied the civil allegations, which could lead tostiff fines and even to removal of the company's brokerage license.   Federal prosecutors have not disclosed whether they will filecriminal charges. Ruder said SEC investigators have maintained acontinuing relationship with the U.S. attorney in New York, but hewould not elaborate.   Ruder and the SEC's chief enforcer, Gary Lynch, said the Drexellitigation and similar cases have stretched the agency's resourcesto the limit. Because of staff limitations, they said, the Drexelcase may force the SEC to forgo other initiatives.   There is a growing tendency in the securities industry tochallenge SEC complaints, rather than settle out of court, Rudersaid. Two years ago, 18 SEC cases were being litigated; today thereare 60, he said.   Ruder said the $160 million SEC budget the Reagan administrationsought for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1 is ``the minimum for thecommission to fulfill its responsibilities.''   ``The commission has reached the limits of its resources inefficiency, and now needs additional resources,'' he said.   Ruder and Lynch discounted suggestions that the Drexel case, ifsuccessful, could doom the ``junk bond'' industry, in which Drexelis a leader. That is the term given a relatively new form ofhigh-risk, high-yield security often used to finance corporatetakeovers or now enterprises.   ``One can characterize the complaint as not involving junkbonds, and therefore there is not any connection,'' Ruder said.   ``There is nothing inherent in the trading of junk bonds thatrequires one be involved in fraud or manipulation,'' said Lynch.   Ruder said the SEC is ``absolutely confident we are going toprevail'' in the Drexel case, and defended the fact the agencyspent two years and documented 17 allegations before filing thecomplaint.   Rep. Howard C. Nielson, R-Utah, complained that ``you could haveshaken us (Congress) nicely with only three or four'' allegationsseveral months earlier, ``when there was still time for thissession of Congress to act.''   ``We have a potent array of weapons'' against fraud already,Ruder replied, indicating no new legislation would have helped inthe pursuit of the Drexel case.   Nevertheless, he said he supports a bill sponsored by Markey andothers, due for a House vote next week, that would toughen lawsagainst insider trading _ the profiting from access to non-publicinformation.   ``An increase in sanctions in the insider-trading area will behelpful,'' Ruder said.</TEXT></DOC>
