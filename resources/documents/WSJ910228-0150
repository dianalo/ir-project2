Much more quietly, Sony also is forging linkswith a wide variety of small high-technology companies in theU.S.   But instead of buying stakes in small companies -- as manyother companies, such as International Business MachinesCorp., seek to do -- Sony is gambling on cooperativeventures. It is sharing its research staff, productionfacilities and even business plans for specific products withsmall companies.   Sony says it wants to work with as many small companies aspossible to expand applications for its technology and findsmall-business technology that complements its own. InTarzana, Calif., Sony is working with Panavision Inc., todevelop a lens for high-definition television cameras. In SanJose, it is collaborating with Compression Labs Inc. on avideo-conferencing machine. In Durham, N.C., it is helpingAlphatronix Inc. develop rewritable optical-disk storagesystems for computers. In Boulder, Colo., Sony is supplyingthe 8mm tape drive at the heart of Exabyte Corp.'s computerstorage system.   Working with small companies is Sony's way ofunderstanding new markets, says Michael Schulhof, vicechairman Sony USA. &quot;If the companies succeed, they validatethe existence of that market. If they don't, you know themarket isn't there.&quot; Also, &quot;small entrepreneurial companiescan move new ideas ahead more effectively than big corporategiants,&quot; he says.   But Sony is structuring its alliances differently frommany other Japanese and U.S. companies. &quot;Other Japanesecompanies feel more comfortable about owning the technology;Sony doesn't,&quot; says Robert Freese, co-founder of Alphatronix.Unlike IBM and other big high-tech companies, Sony doesn'twant an equity stake in a collaborator as a prelude to buyingits product or sharing technology.   The strategy clearly has paid big dividends for Sony.Using such companies as Alphatronix and Pinnacle Micro Inc.,Irvine, Calif., to sell its rewritable optical-disk drive --in combination with its own sales to Hewlett-Packard Co. --Sony commands approximately a 58% share of the burgeoningoptical-drive business, says Jay Bretzmann, a technologyanalyst with International Data Corp., a Framingham, Mass.,market research firm. Through alliances with Compression andExabyte, Sony has established a strong presence in otherniche markets. &quot;Alliances have helped Sony reach new marketsquickly,&quot; Mr. Bretzmann says.   While many big companies shy away from untested, fledglingcompanies, Sony has been willing to listen and deal,entrepreneurs say. Exabyte, for example, approached a numberof big 8mm video-system makers after the company was startedin 1986 but only Sony was willing to take a chance with theyoung company, says Peter Behrendt, Exabyte's chief executiveofficer. Similarly, Sony agreed to let Pinnacle Micro sellits optical storage device even though Pinnacle was only ayear old and had less than $1 million in revenue, says ScottBlum, a Pinnacle co-founder.   Entrepreneurs say much of Sony's success with smallcompanies comes from selecting partners with businessstrategies that complement Sony's. &quot;It helps to quiet fearsthat they are out to take over your market,&quot; says JohnFarrand, chief executive officer of Panavision.   Panavision was already a major maker of cinematographicequipment before Sony approached it to work on a newhigh-definition TV camera. Panavision's expertise was inlenses for motion picture cameras, while Sony was a leader invideo electronics, Mr. Farrand says. Besides, Panavisionleases its products to customers, while Sony is a seller.   From the beginning there was no confusion over rolesbetween the partners, Mr. Farrand says. Panavision isdeveloping a new lens for the Sony video camera, while Sonyis providing Panavision with key technical information andnews of technical changes. Eventually, Panavision will leasethe cameras to its customers, and Sony will sell them. SaysWilliam Connolly, a senior Sony executive: &quot;There's noconflict in what we're trying to achieve. We're bothexpanding our markets.&quot;   While such relationships have been fruitful, they taketime. It took years of working with Compression before Sonyagreed to a collaboration, says John Walsh, executive vicepresident for Compression. Sony first signed up to distributeCompression's video-conferencing device for Asia five yearsago. But it took another two years before Sony suggested ajoint development effort. Under the arrangement, Compressionworks on the technology to compress images for telephonetransmission while Sony works on improving the quality of theimages.   The association with Sony provided Compression with a&quot;well-respected partner,&quot; Mr. Walsh says. And it letCompression tap into Sony's research and development andmanufacturing.   In such alliances, trust often is built up in small steps.&quot;We spent a lot of time trying to figure out how each of uscould work together without having the other stealproprietary technology,&quot; says Alphatronix founder RobertFreese.   At each meeting, one party would reveal a little more ofits secrets, Mr. Freese recalls. At one of the first meetingshe demonstrated his optical storage system to Sony. At thenext meeting, Sony showed to Mr. Freese and his researchersprototypes of its hardware. Mr. Freese then agreed to letSony's scientists test the system in his laboratory. Inexchange, Sony agreed to let Mr. Freese's staff take a closerlook at its prototype. &quot;It took a long time and a lot ofmeetings before we felt comfortable and confident about thesuccess of the relationship,&quot; Mr. Freese says.   Today, Alphatronix buys optical disk drives from Sony thatit uses in a datastorage system of its own design. In themarket for rewritable optical storage systems, Alphatronixand Sony already are viewed as leading players.   For all its successes with small companies, Sony says itis careful not to depend on them for vital products. &quot;You cannever base your strategy on their success,&quot; says Mr.Schulhof. &quot;If it's that important to us, we'll make itourselves.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
