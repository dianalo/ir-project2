The dollar sell-off began in Japanese currency markets inturbulent trading which was later matched in European and New Yorkmarkets.   Traders reported that the dollar's plunge was aided bycoordinated selling on the part of the central banks of the UnitedStates, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France and Canada.   Finance ministers and central bank presidents from thosecountries, along with Italy, on Saturday issued a blunt statementexpressing displeasure with increases this year in the dollar'svalue, a rise which many fear will abort needed improvement in theU.S. trade deficit. A stronger dollar makes U.S. products lesscompetitive on overseas markets.   The finance ministers, in Washington for the annual meetings ofthe International Monetary Fund and World Bank, pronounced theirsatisfaction today with the dollar's decline.   French Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy said that thecoordinated intervention on the part of governments to push thedollar lower was a ``confirmation and illustration'' of the resolveof the Group of Seven to cooperate on international economicmatters.   Some critics have complained that the G-7 coordination processwas in danger of coming apart, given a failure so far in the yearby the group to influence the dollar's exchange rate.   Beregovoy, briefing reporters at the French Embassy, said thatthe G-7 communique ``meant what it said'' and he said it reflected``the reassertion of our common will to cooperate in monetaryterms.''   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business daybegins, the dollar plunged 2.05 yen to a closing 142.95 yen. Thedollar later fell even further in London trading.   Karl Otto Poehl, president of the West German central bank,confirmed for reporters that widespread intervention was occurringand said that it was ``appropriate and reasonable'' given the needto make further progress in reducing world trade imbalances.   Despite today's sharp plunge in the dollar's value, privateeconomists said it remained to be seen whether intervention wouldwork any better in the long term than it has up until now atkeeping the U.S. currency from rising.   The sessions of the IMF and World Bank are focusing on suchtopics as the Bush administration efforts to reduce a portion ofthe Third World's debt burden and proposals to assist in thedramatic political and economic reforms under way in Poland andHungary.   IMF officials told reporters today that there had been no finaldecision on the question of doubling IMF resources, although theypredicted that the matter could still be resolved by the end ofthis year.   While there is overwhelming support among the 152 nations for atleast some type of increase, the United States, which has vetopower on the issue, remains opposed.   IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus insisted that the outlookfor an increase still looked encouraging, saying he believed therewas a ``growing perception of the weight of the responsibilitiesput on our sholders'' to help carry out the Bush administration'sThird World debt reduction strategy.   In the Group of Seven communique, issued late Saturday after aday of closed-door dicussions, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Bradyand his counterparts from the other countries expressed theirdispleasure with the persistent increase in the dollar's value thisyear.   The joint statement called the dollar's increase ``inconsistentwith longer-run economic fundamentals'' and said a further risecould ``adversely affect prospects for the world economy.''   The Saturday session was the first meeting of the financeministers and central bank presidents since last April. At thattime, the officials had also decried the rising value of thedollar, although the language used was milder in tone.   The stepped-up sense of urgency led many private economists toexpect a heavy effort at intervention today.   David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston andamp; Co., agovernment securities dealer, said he was also looking for Japanand West Germany to show more willingness in the months ahead toraise interest rates in their countries as a way of influencingcurrency markets.   Higher interest rates overseas relative to U.S. rates would makedollar-denominated investments less attractive to foreign investors.   But some analysts said they were not sure whether the latesteffort would be any more successful than the April vow to keep thedollar from rising in value.   Despite heavy intervention in the currency markets since lastspring, the dollar has continued rising and now stands about 20percent above its January level in relation to the Japanese yen. Itis about 25 percent above its January level against the West Germanmark.   Before Saturday's G-7 meeting, the dollar bought 146 yen and1.95 marks, well above what is presumed to be the upper limit ofthe trading range sought by the Group of Seven _ 140 yen and 1.90marks.   ``The fact of the matter is intervention does not work in thelong run,'' said economist David Wyss of DRI-McGraw Hill. He andother economists said what really was needed was for the UnitedStates and other countries to improve underlying economicconditions.   For the United States, that would mean stronger efforts toreduce its budget deficit, which drains away domestic savings andpushes up U.S. interest rates, and greater efforts in West Germanyand Japan to reduce their huge trade surpluses with the UnitedStates.   On Sunday, Brady said the administration was making strides inreducing the federal deficit and he called on countries runninglarge trade surpluses, such as Japan and West Germany, to do moreto stimulate domestic demand and open their borders to U.S. exports.   msc</TEXT></DOC>
