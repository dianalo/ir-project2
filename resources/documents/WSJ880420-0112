The task force, sponsored by the Twentieth Century Fund, a nonprofit research foundation, said that Senate confirmation of Supreme Court nominees should be based &quot;on a nominee's written record and the testimony of legal experts as to his competence.&quot;    If Supreme Court nominees do testify, the task force said, senators shouldn't question them directly about specific issues on which the nominees may later have to rule.    Supreme Court nominees aren't legally required to appear before the Senate, and none did until some 60 years ago. In recent decades, however, such appearances have become customary, and it is unlikely the Judiciary Committee would act on an appointment today without a chance to question the nominee.    The task force included former New York Gov. Hugh Carey, former New York City Mayor Robert Wagner, University of Chicago law professor Philip Kurland, American Enterprise Institute legal expert Walter Berns, former Carter administration officials Lloyd Cutler and Joseph Califano, former Reagan administration official Michael Uhlmann, and North Dakota Attorney General Nicholas Spaeth.    The recommendations prompted some dissent within the task force. Messrs. Califano and Cutler, both Washington lawyers, objected to the suggestion that Supreme Court nominees bypass hearings and that the Senate act on the basis of legal experts' views and nominees' written records.    In other recommendations, the panel said more emphasis should be placed on finding nominees for federal district judgeships who have had trial experience; those nominees should be chosen by bipartisan commissions; and judges shouldn't be chosen because they are thought to share the president's or the Senate's judicial philosophy.    The task force, over Mr. Califano's dissent, concluded that the Supreme Court nominating process &quot;is too visible and attracts too much publicity.&quot; Too much attention, it said, has turned some confirmation hearings into national referendums. They said televised hearings are used by senators, the White House and the Justice Department &quot;for other purposes, ranging from self-promotion to mobilizing special-interest groups in order to influence public opinion.&quot;    But the report said the process of approving district and appeals court appointees should have a higher profile. Confirmation hearings should be announced in advance, and a Judiciary subcommittee should conduct hearings in the region in which a judge will sit.    In unveiling their report yesterday, members of the group said their observations weren't prompted solely by the Senate's rejection in October of Judge Robert Bork, President Reagan's nominee to the Supreme Court. The panel began its review of the process well before Mr. Bork was nominated, they said.    The aim, the report said, was to address the problem of questioning nominees about policy issues. &quot;Choosing candidates for anything other than their legal qualifications damages the public's perception of the institutional prestige of the judiciary and calls into question the high ideal of judicial independence,&quot; the report said. </TEXT></DOC>
