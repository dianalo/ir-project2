International criticism of ambiguous German policies atthe outbreak of war gave rise to a national soul-searching.</LP><TEXT>   Anti-war protests continue, but now they are outweighed byrecent polls showing an overwhelming majority of Germans notonly support U.S. policy in the Persian Gulf, but want tomaintain close security ties with Washington in the future.   A bloody ground war could shift opinion. But growingturmoil in the Soviet Union, at a time when 340,000 ofMoscow's troops remain on German soil, has reinforcedpro-Western attitudes.   The crises in the Gulf and in the U.S.S.R. have remindedGermans that security threats didn't all disappear with theBerlin Wall. Nearly two-thirds of Germans in polls last weeksaid the troops in Germany remain important to theircountry's stability; the same number expressed confidence inWashington's capability to handle international problems.   In another indication of popular support for the U.S.-ledcoalition, 57% of Germans in a poll by Der Spiegel magazinereplied that the U.S. shouldn't have waited longer to launchthe war, with only 38% saying it would have been better towait.   At a conference of insurance executives in Frankfurt lastweek, the moderator went so far as to wonder whether the tensof thousands of American troops that have moved from Germanbases to the Gulf have left his country exposed.   &quot;Who is keeping watch on the Oder?&quot; asked Gerhard Fels,the director of the Institute for German Economy in Cologne,referring to the river that marks the eastern boundary ofunified Germany. For now, the concern is theoretical, butrecent political changes have left worries about whethermatters can turn bad as quickly as they turned good.   Chancellor Helmut Kohl, an expert at reading public moods,has shifted his government's policy in the past two weeks toone of much more resolute support and greater financialcommitment for the U.S. policy. He significantly increasedGermany's financial contribution to 15.6 billion marks ($l0.7billion) and, in response to deteriorating relations withIsrael, sent Patriot missiles and a series of high-rankingofficials, including Foreign Minister Hans Dietrich Genscher,to Israel.   And after false starts, Germany made clear its commitmentwithin NATO to respond if Turkey is attacked. Bonn also hasdeported 28 Iraqi diplomats and significantly toughenedexport controls. However, the Kohl government has lookedreactive at best and passive at worst.   Western diplomats believe that Bonn, and particulary Mr.Genscher, actually fed anti-war protests by not taking aclear stand early on.   Surprisingly, the Iraq war debate has stirred more publicemotion here than that over unification, partly because theevents have summoned up unsavory periods of Germany's past. Arash of often obtuse articles has compared Saddam Hussein toHitler and Baathist Iraq to Nazi Germany. The BerlinerMorgenpost claimed Iraq's Republican Guards have beenpatterned after Hitler's Waffen SS troops who remained soloyal to the end.   The most sensitive issue for Germans has been thenightmare that chemical weapons, built with the aid of Germantechnology, will rain down upon Israel.   When Scud missiles started hitting Israel, Germanindustrialists urged the closing of loopholes to blockexports of militarily useful items. Economic Ministryofficials believe that the range of the Scuds has beenimproved by German know-how.   The popular press has taken the lead in backing the U.S.and its allies in the Gulf. The mass circulation Bild amSonntag newspaper launched a letter-writing campaign insupport of President Bush. The popular magazine Bunte lastweek ran a cover story that asked: &quot;Should We Germans BeAshamed of Ourselves?&quot;   All this notwithstanding, an outspoken and powerfulsegment of society is virulently against the war and forloosening ties with Washington. In one troubling new trend,Germans have increasingly exercised their constitutionalright to refuse military service. Some 22,000 took this pathin January, opting for alternative service, more than threetimes the monthly average last year.   And white sheets continue to hang from windows in Berlinand elsewhere, often with large letters: &quot;Nein.&quot;   The political polarization has been brought intoparticularly sharp focus by a rancorous debate among theopposition Social Democrats. Their candidate in December'selections, Oscar Lafontaine, continues to drum up resistanceto the war in the face of heavy criticism from former SocialDemocratic Chancellor Willy Brandt, who speaks of thesimilarities between Saddam and Hitler.   German officials also expect more strains with the U.S. onissues ranging from interest rates to agricultural policy.Yet despite all the understandable agonizing and problems,the refreshingly open debate in Germany over the past twoweeks has encouraged American policy makers. Albeitbelatedly, the government has been shaken from itspost-unification slumber and now expresses more of a desireto take on an international role.   &quot;Germany has come to terms with its history, and in thefuture it can only recognize its role as a world power andshould expand this,&quot; Chancellor Kohl said recently. &quot;ForGermans, there is no special niche in history in worldpolitics. Germans aren't allowed to take flight from theirresponsibilities.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
