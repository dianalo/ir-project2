Gorbachev said Wednesday the coal strikecould imperil his reforms.   Gorbachev said there were reports of railway workers being urgedto strike, and if labor trouble spreads, ``we may have to take suchextreme measures that it will hurt what we've been doing'' tomodernize the economy. He did not elaborate.   Strikes are rare in the Soviet Union and were ended by forcebefore Gorbachev gained power in March 1985.   Tass said 24,000 strikers in the Kuznetsk Coal Basin of westernSiberia were working Wednesday after some of their demands weregranted, and called the partial return a ``change for the better.''State television said 150,000 Kuznetsk miners remained on strike.   Izvestia, the government newspaper, said strike committees infour Kuznetsk cities decided to end the walkout, which began July11, and that coal deliveries had resumed.   A correspondent said on the evening television news program``Vremya'' that the strike had spread to 70 of the 120 mines in theDonetsk Basin of the Ukraine, more than triple the previous number,and mine construction workers joined the walkout.   In a report from the Donetsk city of Yenakiyevo, ``Vremya'' saidsteel and coke-chemical plants were ``on the verge of a stoppage''for lack of coal. A striker said on the program that miners agreedto provide 1,000 tons to one coke-chemical plant to keep it running.   Earlier reports in the official press had said operations atsteel and power plants were affected by short supplies of coal andcoke.   The strikes in the country's two leading coal basins are theworst Soviet labor unrest since the turbulence of the 1920s, a fewyears after the 1917 Bolshevik revolution.   In Moscow, Gorbachev told the national legislature the strikeshad deprived the nation of more than 1 million tons of coal and``there are reports of calls to railroad workers to join the strikeas of Aug. 1.''   ``Such a development of events poses a threat to theimplementation of plans projected by the policy of perestroika,''his economic reform program, Gorbachev said, and issued his warningabout possible ``extreme measures'' if the trouble spreads.   Gorbachev said he and Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov sent a telegramassuring Donetsk miners all concessions granted the Siberian minerswould apply to the men working other Soviet coal fields.   The government agreed to most miner demands, including those onpensions and overtime, Gorbachev told the Supreme Sovietlegislature, but he added that settling some longer-term issueswould take up to a month.   Tass outlined a concessions package tha includes bonus pay tonight shifts and for men using pneumatic hammers. Strikers also havecomplained about poor housing and shortages of consumer goods andfood, and the government has made general pledges of improvements inthose areas.   Anatoly Saunin, a legislator from Donetsk, told the SupremeSoviet every day lost in the mines costs millions of rubles thatotherwise might help improve living conditions in the entire nation.   ``You mustn't hold a knife to the throat'' of the government, hesaid, apparently addressing the strikers.   Izvestia said coal production worth $31 million had been lost inDonetsk and the strike had cost industry in one Siberian region $75million.</TEXT></DOC>
