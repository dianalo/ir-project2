A week after Eastern said it would stop flying, theInternational Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workerssaid it would take down its picket lines and stop issuing the$100-a-week strike benefits it has been paying out sinceMarch 1989. That's when 8,831 Eastern IAM members --virtually all its membership -- staged a massive walkoutalong with most Eastern flight attendants and pilots. Theiraction virtually grounded the Miami-based airline and helpedtip it into bankruptcy-court protection within days.</LP><TEXT>   Ron Orr, general chairman of the machinists local inMiami, said the strike was ended because Eastern stoppedflying and its assets are already being snapped up by othercarriers.   A spokeswoman for Eastern said the airline would have nocomment.   When the Machinists first struck, the unions said theytook their action less over pay and benefits than overcontrol of the airline. They opposed the management of TexasAir Corp. and its then-chairman Frank Lorenzo. Mr. Lorenzoand his managers ultimately were ousted from control ofEastern by a bankruptcy judge, who installed trustee MartinR. Shugrue Jr. to run it. The machinists also opposed Mr.Shugrue.   The pilots and flight attendants called off their sympathystrike in November 1989, after Eastern began hiringreplacement workers. The machinists, however, didn't budgefrom their picket lines.   Over the nearly two years, the number of strikers stillreceiving their strike check dropped to 5,746, as many leftfor other jobs or moved away.</TEXT></DOC>
