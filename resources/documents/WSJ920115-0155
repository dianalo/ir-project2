TheBundesbank increased its discount rate, the cheapest rate atwhich banks can borrow, to 8% and its emergency overnightLombard rate, the effective ceiling on overnight rates, to9.77%. The Bundesbank's move forced most of Germany'sEuropean partners to take similar action, despite the bleakeconomic environment.   The U.S., of course, was a different story. The day afterthe Bundesbank increases, the Federal Reserve decided tolower its discount rate by no less than a full percentagepoint to 3.5%, its lowest level since 1964. This was thelargest single cut in the rate since 1934, and it had beenpreceded by five others in 1991. The U.S. discount rate isnow 50% below its 1989 peak.</LP><TEXT>   How to explain such divergent economic policies? Thecurrent picture of the major economies is rather mixed, tosay the least. In the U.S., Britain, Canada and Australia,the recession has taken its toll. In all four countries realgross domestic product is down from its level of a year ago.In contrast, most European economies managed to chalk uppositive performances in 1991, although they posted slowergrowth than in 1990.   This situation has raised many questions, on both sides ofthe Atlantic, leaving many wondering:   Aren't the German and American decisions likely to canceleach other out, and don't they run counter to the avowedcoordination of monetary policies by the G-7 nations?   And, since the price of gold did not rise in response tothe Federal Reserve's rate cut, indicating that inflation isnot for the moment a threat, does that not mean that theFederal Reserve is right and the Bundesbank is wrong?   Understanding the Bundesbank's decision is not easy. Therewere, however, at least four motives at work.   1. The move indicated that parochial German politicsrather than an understanding of the global economy prevailsat the Bundesbank. The most internationally minded Bundesbankofficials, Chairman Helmut Schlesinger and Vice Chairman HansTietmeyer, opposed the rate hike. The vote in favor of it wascarried by the representatives of the state governments onthe Bundesbank's board.   The interest rate hike is the financial accompaniment toan increasing mood of &quot;Germany First.&quot; Germany decided lastmonth to recognize the independence of Croatia and Slovenia,ignoring the objections of the U.S., France and the UnitedNations. Recently, too, Germany has demanded that German beintroduced as one of the working languages of the EuropeanCommunity, alongside English and French. No less symptomatic,perhaps, is the fact that the interest rate hikes wereintroduced shortly after European leaders gathered at theMaastricht summit, where important decisions were takenregarding the future European monetary union. The Bundesbankclearly wanted to signal who is the master on board.   2. The Bundesbank, unlike the other European centralbanks, is not paying much attention to the gold price. Itappears instead to be concerned with the behavior of thedomestic money supply (currently at the higher end of thetarget range) and of wage negotiations (many German unionsare demanding a 10% pay rise this year, exceeding the 4% or5% that the Bundesbank finds acceptable). Neither is theBundesbank paying much attention to the German stock market.At the end of 1990, only about 5% of the German populationheld any stocks -- a figure well down from the level of the1960s and much less than the 20% that owns them in the U.S.   3. A growing number of European currencies -- unlike thedollar and the yen -- have gradually reverted to a system ofnear-fixed exchange rates through the European Exchange RateMechanism (ERM). Since the German mark is the anchor of theERM, the Bundesbank feels it should seek to safeguard thestability of the German currency in order to support thecredibility of the scheme as a whole.   4. The integration of eastern Germany is proving to be anexpensive exercise. The budget deficit bulged to 5% of GDP in1991. As a result, Germany needs all its domestic capitalresources and might even need to import funds. High interestrates are essential to attracting the necessary capital. TheBundesbank also feels that the German federal government haspursued an unwarrantedly expansionist fiscal policy in orderto achieve unification. In no way does the bank intend toaccommodate this expansion by allowing the mark todepreciate.   Americans who are inclined to think that it is the Fed'slenience, and not the Bundesbank's severity, that is correctmight want to recall that over the past 20 years, the U.S.monetary authorities have permitted the dollar to lose nearly90% of its value against gold. The price of gold has risenfrom $40 an ounce in the early 1970s to $350. The dollar hasalso been allowed to depreciate, though not as fast, againstthe mark, sliding from 3.7 marks after the Bretton Woodssystem collapsed in 1971, to fewer than 1.60 marks today. Thefuture will tell whether the latest monetary decisions werewarranted or not, and which was eventually right, the FederalReserve or the Bundesbank.   The Federal Reserve tends to take a short-term view of thestability of money; offering interest rate cuts wheneverinflation seems to have subsided. This is a policy favorableto risk-takers, entrepreneurs and stock market investors, asthe chart shows.   Germans, who lost all their savings in anti-inflationmonetary reforms in 1923 and 1948, take a longer view. That'swhy the Bundesbank knows no compromise in the defense of themark. That is why it sometimes seems that the Bundesbankfavors the saver at the expense of the entrepreneur.   ---   Mr. Leuschel is chief strategist for Bank BrusselsLambert.</TEXT></DOC>
