Lee (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> FIN </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Mario L. Baeza's calling card could read: &quot;Renaissance Man for All Seasons.&quot;    In the past few months, Mr. Baeza, a partner in the law firm of Debevoise andamp; Plimpton, orchestrated Kelso andamp; Co.'s $2.5 billion leveraged buy-out of American Standard Inc. and helped shape a state legislative proposal that would ban surrogate motherhood for a fee, a volatile issue in the wake of the Baby M case.    For counterpoint, the former Atlanta Braves draft choice worked on his professional music career, teaming with pop musician Roberta Flack to write several songs for one of her future albums.    &quot;Personally, there's a rewarding cross-pollination in representing corporate clients and working on difficult public policy issues,&quot; says Mr. Baeza, who is 37 years old. As for music, he says, &quot;It helps keep me sane.&quot;    Whether it's business or public policy, Mr. Baeza thrives by forging compromise decisions on tough problems. He helped Kelso, a New York investment banking firm, persuade Black andamp; Decker Corp. to drop its two-month hostile pursuit of American Standard in exchange for $25 million to cover expenses.    Compromise was also essential on the surrogate motherhood issue. Mr. Baeza is co-chairman of a committee on new reproductive technologies that prepared the report, which recommends that surrogate motherhood be discouraged in general and be banned as a commercial practice.    The committee is part of a task force set up by New York Gov. Mario Cuomo to explore legal and public policy issues raised by such new medical technologies as organ transplantation.    &quot;Surrogate motherhood has clearly been the hardest issue that we've tackled yet in the task force,&quot; says Mr. Baeza. &quot;We had to decide whose interests ought to be paramount: infertile couples, surrogate parents, the children, (surrogate motherhood) brokers? We ended up looking at the issue in terms of the best interests of the child, and concluded that the best interests of brokers was against public policy.&quot;    Gov. Cuomo is expected to push for enactment of the legislation by year end. New York's action would be very influential as states develop policy on the subject, says Mr. Baeza.    Mr. Baeza's public policy involvement grows out of his view that the law should be a tool of social change, as well as a source of livelihood. For instance, he started the new-technologies practice at Debevoise andamp; Plimpton, and thus honed his knowledge of medical-technology issues.    As a corporate attorney, Mr. Baeza, a Harvard Law School graduate, is considered by many takeover specialists to be among the best lawyers in New York for leveraged transactions that include employee stock ownership plans, or ESOPs.    Last year, for example, Mr. Baeza devised the ESOP that was the centerpiece of the $3.5 billion recapitalization plan Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. adopted to fend off a hostile takeover attempt from British publisher Robert Maxwell.    &quot;He's not as well known as some (takeover) lawyers, but in terms of quality, he's as good as anybody,&quot; says Frank Nickell, a partner at Kelso.    &quot;Mario knows how to bring people together,&quot; says William Reid, director of corporate finance at First Boston Corp., which provided much of the financing in Kelso's buy-out of American Standard. &quot;When you do a deal with him, everyone knows it will get done and be fair.&quot;    Mr. Baeza came to the U.S. from Cuba in 1958. As one of a handful of black partners at major New York law firms -- and the only one concentrating on mergers and acquisitions -- Mr. Baeza also has managed to represent minority-owned businesses often ignored by larger law firms.    &quot;A big issue for minorities is picking wisely where they are going to start their careers,&quot; says Mr. Baeza, a star high school outfielder in New Jersey who eschewed a shot at a baseball career to attend Cornell University.    &quot;There was some luck involved in my coming to Debevoise andamp; Plimpton instead of going another firm,&quot; says Mr. Baeza. &quot;Unfortunately, there still are a lot of law firms where the cards are stacked against minorities.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
