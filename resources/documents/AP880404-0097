The protesters, part of a group touring the ship, includedveteran activist Phillip Berrigan and Gregory Boertje, a federalfugitive for more than four months. They were arrested Sunday andheld without bond at Virginia Beach City Jail until today'sarraignment.   U.S. Magistrate Tommy Miller set bond at $2,500, and at therequest of defense attorney Oldrick J. LaBel, continued theprotesters' appearance until April 15. At that time a trial datewill be set.   The group picked the battleship as the target of the protestbecause ``they see the Iowa as a symbol ... of super-statemadness,'' said Max Obuszewski, a spokesman for Plowshares, a peacegroup founded by Berrigan eight years ago.   Capt. Archie Galloway, a Navy spokesman, said the incidentoccurred about 3:50 p.m. as a group of 10 to 15 people was beingled on a topside tour of the Iowa, which was docked at NorfolkNaval Base.   The four wandered away from the rest of the group ``and threwwhat they claimed to be blood on two of the ship's armored boxlaunchers,'' which house the Tomahawk missiles, Galloway said.   The protesters ``were immediately apprehended by Iowa crewmembers,'' he said. ``There was no apparent damage to thelaunchers.''   In addition to Berrigan and Boertje, those arrested were AndrewLawrence and Sister Margaret McKenna. Berrigan, Boertje andLawrence are from Baltimore, and Sister McKenna is from Fox Chase,Pa., a Philadelphia suburb.   Boertje, 32, has been wanted by the FBI since he failed to showat his Nov. 17, 1987, sentencing for his part in damaging militaryaircraft at Willow Grove Naval Air Station outside Philadelphia.
