Stewart B. McKinney,a Republican who became the first member of Congress known to havedied from AIDS, is urging the GOP to put a strong election-yearstatement on battling the deadly disease in the party's platform.   ``A Republican platform devoid of a major commitment to solvingthe problems of AIDS would send a clear signal to the Americanpeople that the Republican Party wants to bury its head in the sandand not confront one of the major issues of our day,'' LucieMcKinney told Republican officials Tuesday at a platform hearing onsocial issues.   ``If the Republicans are going to present themselves to theAmerican people as the party of compassion, then we as a partycannot fail to put forth a responsible policy on AIDS,'' she said.   Mrs. McKinney has become an outspoken advocate of spending andresearch on acquired immune deficiency syndrome since the deathlast year of her husband, a nine-term congressman from Connecticut.   ``AIDS doesn't only touch people in big cities. ... It isaffecting people right in our home towns, people we know, people wegrew up with, people we work and live with. People just like us,''she said.   Mrs. McKinney said the party platform should include pledges toincrease spending for AIDS counseling for patients and families,expand the availability of test drugs, fight AIDS discrimination byemployers and insurance companies and support AIDS residences thatcan help care for patients.   ``I don't want our platform to be silent on (AIDS) educationbecause it might offend some people,'' said Sen. Lowell P. WeickerJr., R-Conn. ``I don't want to hear any rubbish that if you educateyou're teaching people to be drug addicts or teaching people to behomosexuals.''   The platform hearing was called at the request of Weicker afterdomestic policy platform hearings were scheduled for Kansas City.Weicker and other GOP liberals and moderates felt the schedulingwas an attempt by conservatives to push social issues such as AIDSand homelessness to the background.   John Buchanan, a former Republican congressman from Alabama andchairman of People for the American Way Action Fund, a liberaladvocacy group on constitutional issues, warned that the GOP wasslipping away from mainstream voters.   ``Will we be the party of Abraham Lincoln and Dwight Eisenhower,or the party of Jerry Falwell and Phyllis Schlafly?'' Buchanan said.   AIDS is an incurable condition that attacks the body's immunesystem, rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases andinfections.   Its chief victims have been homosexual men and intravenous drugusers, although a small percentage of cases are attributed totransfusions of contaminated blood, heterosexual contact and spreadfrom infected pregnant women to their offspring.   McKinney's doctor said he probably contracted the AIDS virusfrom blood transfusions during heart surgery in 1979. But publishedreports following his death said McKinney had homosexual relations.   Asked if the newspaper reports about homosexual encounters weretrue, Mrs. McKinney has said she didn't know of any.   As of June 6, AIDS had been diagnosed in 64,506 Americans, ofwhom more than half, or 36,255 have died, according to the CDC. Noone is known to have recovered from AIDS.</TEXT></DOC>
