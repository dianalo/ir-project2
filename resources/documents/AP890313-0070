The extreme-right National Democratic Party picked up seven seatsin the Frankfurt city legislature Sunday as well as seats in theMain-Kinzig district council east of Hanau and in the city of BadHersfeld, near the East German border.   The ultra-right Republican Party gained seats in two districtcouncils and in the city council of Bad Nauheim north of Frankfurt.In January, the Republicans gained 11 seats in the West Berlin citylegislature.   The far-right parties support expulsion of foreign workers andasylum-seekers from the country.   Heinz Galinski, the head of the Jewish community, bitterlyattacked the outcome.   ``The move to the right and the renunciation of the democraticparties represent the trend of the Federal Republic (West Germany)in the 40th year of its existence,'' Galinski told The AssociatedPress.   Galinski added: ``The year 1989 is more suitable to reflect ondemocracy and to protect it.''   In voting across Hesse state, the Christian Democrats sufferedlosses of 6.8 percent compared with the 1985 elections. Thatincludes losing power in Frankfurt, which the party had controlledfor 12 years.   The left-leaning Social Democrats will have 40 seats in the newlyformed city parliament, the environmentalist Greens 10 seats and theChristian Democrats 36.   ``Right-wing radicalism must be decisively combated,'' theChristian Democrats' general secretary, Heiner Geissler, told Hessestate radio.   Less than two months ago, the Christian Democrats were oustedfrom power in West Berlin.   The Greens and Social Democrats are expected to form a governingcoalition in West Berlin, and Christian Democrats fear the samecould happen on the federal level after next year's elections.   Critics claim the Christian Democrats are as a result trying toappeal to more conservative voters and have been adopting some ofthe causes of the far right.   Some members of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governing party calledtoday for a revamping of its strategy.   In Bonn, prominent Christian Democratic politician JuergenTodenhoefer urged an emergency meeting of the party.   ``For six years, the party has been experiencing one electionfiasco after another, without making any serious analysisafterwards,'' he said in a letter to Kohl. He released a copy to thenews media.   Statewide in Hesse, the extreme right made gains.   The Frankfurt vote gives the party a small but vocal oppositionforce in one of West Germany's most important cities and itsfinancial capital. It is the first time since 1968 the NationalDemocrats have had representation in Frankfurt.   In the town of Woelfersheim, the party won nearly 16 percent ofthe vote or more than double its results in the last elections in1985.   The Republicans gained seats in local councils in the RheingauTaunus district near the Rhine River and in the Wetterau districtnortheast of Frankfurt. The exact number of seats was not determined.</TEXT></DOC>
