However, the negotiations between the union and United are underthe supervision of a federal mediator who would have to declare animpasse and call for a 30-day cooling-off period before a strikecould be called.   The negotiations, which fall under the jurisdiction of theRailway Labor Act, are in recess, the union said Tuesday.   The union represents about 13,500 United attendants and has beennegotiating with the carrier for nearly two years.   One tentative agreement that included major concessions, reachedin November 1987, was rejected by the rank and file.   The Association of Flight Attendants said 95 percent of the 9,980ballots favored giving union leaders the authority to call a strike.   United also is involved in negotiations with its pilots and laterthis year is scheduled to open talks with the Machinists union,which represents mechanics and ground personnel.</TEXT></DOC>
