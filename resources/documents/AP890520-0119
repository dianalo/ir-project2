Edgar Tekere's Zimbabwe Unity Movement (ZUM) was formed lastmonth with pledges to fight mounting top-level official corruption,campaign against President Mugabe's aim of establishing a one-partystate next year and halt the march to socialism.   Tekere, who intended to explain his party's policies at twoseparate football stadiums in Harare, was a founder of Mugabe'sgoverning Zimbabwe African National Union (Patriotic Front) partyin 1963.   A onetime secretary-general of the governing party, Tekere, 52,was fired from the politburo and the central committee in Octoberafter publicly denouncing corruption and charging that politicianswere building a personality cult around Mugabe. He founded theoppposition party on April 30.   The Herald newspaper, published in Harare by thestate-controlled Mass Media Trust, reported Saturday that policehad turned down Tekere's applications for permission to hold therallies.   Under Zimbabwean law, all political gatherings have to becleared in advance by the police. Authorities have denied similarrequests by other opposition parties in the past, usually arguingthat they could trigger tensions between rival political supporters.   ``They did request permission to hold the rallies and the policedid not approve,'' Chief Operations Staff Officer Emmanuel Ruzariowas quoted as saying. ``ZUM were notified of the police decisionwithin seven days ... We said no.''   A spokesman for Tekere, speaking on condition of anonymity, saidZUM would fight the ban in the courts.   Tekere has declined to say how many members he has in a countrywith only three other active political parties. Former Tekereloyalists have said the formation of ZUM will only create divisionsin Zimbabwe, a British colony until independence nine years ago.   Mugabe has promised he will transform Zimbabwe into a one-partystate next year after a formal merger of the two main parties, hisown and the Zimbabwe African People's Union (Patriotic Front), inAugust.</TEXT></DOC>
