(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Four armed Mexican naval personnelwho said they were pursuing drug smugglers apparently interrogateda group of American picnickers on a beach more than a half milenorth of the U.S.-Mexican border, authorities said.   The four Mexicans were arrested Sunday night, said San DiegoCounty sheriff's Sgt. Bob Ramirez.   The four men, whose names were being withheld, interrogated agroup of 10 to 15 U.S. citizens who were picnicking on the beach,said Dale Cozart, chief agent for the U.S. Border Patrol in SanDiego.   ``It's a very serious situation,'' Cozart said today. ``Ourinvestigation is not complete at this time, but it's possible theAmericans were being interrogated against their will.''   Border Patrol agents scanning the area in a helicopter spottedthe four men dressed in Mexican naval infantry uniforms and armedwith fully loaded automatic rifles, Cozart said. The weapons werestandard military issue, he added.   ``Initial statements taken were that they were pursuingnarcotics smugglers. But that has not been confirmed and there isno indication that narcotics were being smuggled in the area at thetime,'' Cozart said.   Local residents frequently picnic on the beach into the night,but Cozart said authorities had not been able to speak to any ofthe picnickers because they scattered when the helicopter hoveredoverhead.   The Mexican men said they had been chasing two suspected drug orarms smugglers up the beach when they were discovered. The Mexicansheaded south and were intercepted before they could get across theborder.   In Mexico City, spokesmen for the foreign ministry and theMexican navy said they had no information on the incident.   The men were being held at the Border Patrol's San Ysidro sectorstation, solely for investigation of immigration violations, hesaid.   ``There is no doubt that the individuals knew they were in theUnited States,'' the agent said.   He added that any other allegations, including possible weaponsviolations, would be considered at a later time.   Five sheriff's deputies were called to assist in the arrests,which occurred without incident, Cozart said.   State Department officials as well as the Mexican consulate inSan Diego and Mexican military officials were notified of thearrests.</TEXT></DOC>
