In this paper we describetwo niobium-tin solenoids built at the I.V. Kurchatov Institute of AtomicEnergy from domestic materials, which are distinguished by their veryhigh constructive current density, which permits making quite compactwindings with fully acceptable dimensions for use in laboratory research.</TEXT></DOC>
