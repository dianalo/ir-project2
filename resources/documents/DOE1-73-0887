Since 1950, possibly 6 billiontons of toxic waste have been disposed of in or on the land, creatinga tremendous residual backlog in waste management. Incremental tons ofcontaminated soil, which have leached contaminants from hazardous landfills,have been created over the years. Presently, the Corps of Engineers andthe U.S. EPA are very interested in on-site incineration for the detoxificationof contaminated soil, so that the decontaminated material can be usedfor site reclamation. Since landfill costs range from $200 to $400/tonand incineration costs for on-site cleanup may range from $400 to $600/ton,incineration may appear more expensive. However, considering the liabilityinvolved with landfilling and any possible leakage, costs may exceed$1,000/ton over period of 10-20 years. Considering the liability situation,on-site incineration may look more attractive. In addition, costs fortransportation are reduced, and the costs of fill materials for reclamationare practically eliminated since incinerated soils may be available forreclamation.</TEXT></DOC>
