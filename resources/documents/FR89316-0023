The new provision requiresthat no owner or operator of any gasoline storage tank farm shall offerfor sale, or sell or deliver to any dispensing facility, gasoline havinga Reid Vapor Pressure greater than 9.0 pounds per square inch from May1 through September 15 beginning in 1989 and continuing each year thereafter.The revision also revises Connecticut regulation subsection 22a-174-20(a)to add definitions for ``gasoline storage tank farm'' and ``Reid VaporPressure.''<ITAG tagnum="84">Background </ITAG>On November 12, 1987, the Commissioners of the Northeast States for CoordinatedAir Use Management (NESCAUM) signed a Memorandum of Understanding expressingtheir intention to reduce the Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) of gasoline to10.0 pounds per square inch (psi) starting in the summer of 1988 and to9.0 psi in the summer of 1989 and continuing every ozone season thereafter.The State of Connecticut held a hearing on a regulation to implement sucha strategy on June 30, 1988. Since there were delays in adopting necessaryregulations, the 1988 limit of 10.0 psi has been eliminated and Connecticutis limiting RVP to 9.0 psi from May 1 to September 15 starting in 1989,and continuing each year thereafter. On January 30, 1989, Connecticut submitteda SIP revision to implement this provision to EPA for approval. EPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking on August 19, 1987 (52 FR31274) which would also require the control of RVP. The EPA proposal callsfor control of the volatility of gasoline nationally. In that notice, EPAproposed that in the Northeast the standard would be 10.5 psi from May16 to September 15 in the years 1989-1991 and 9.0 psi during the same timeperiod in 1992 and thereafter. One option EPA is currently consideringis taking final action now only on the 10.5 psi standard to be effectivebeginning in 1989 as an interim standard. The EPA regulation, if finalized,would normally preempt the state provision, under section 211(c)(4) ofthe Clean Air Act. However, section 211(c)(4)(C) of the Act provides forapproval of state control of fuel or fuel additives if the control is partof the SIP and is necessary to achieve the primary or secondary nationalambient air quality standard (NAAQS) which the plan implements.<ITAG tagnum="84">Criteria for Approval </ITAG>Section 211(c)(4)(A) of the Act, in describing federal preemption authority,states:<ITAG tagnum="21">Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (B) or (C), no State(or political subdivision thereof) may prescribe or attempt to enforce,for the purposes of motor vehicle emission control, any control or prohibitionrespecting use of a fule of fuel additive in a motor vehicle or motor vehicleengine_(i) if the Administrator has found that no control or prohibitionunder paragraph (1) is necessary and has published his finding in the <T4>Federal Register, </T4>or (ii) if the Administrator has prescribedunder paragraph (1) a control prohibition applicable to such fuel or fueladditive, unless [the] State prohibition or control is identical to theprohibition or control prescribed by the Administrator.</ITAG>For the reasons described below, we do not believe this section of theAct preempts approval of the Connecticut revision. It is true that theUS Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has held, in <T3>Exxon </T3>v. <T3>City of New York, </T3>548 F.2nd 1088 (2d Cir. 1977), that EPA's regulationof the lead content of gasoline amounts under subparagraph (ii) to thepreemption of State controls of any aspects of the content of gasoline(unless identical to the federal lead content control). Although EPA doesnot agree with that holding in general, it is bound by the decision inall states under the jurisdiction of the 2nd Circuit, including CT. However, even if preemption has occurred, EPA may still approve certainstate provisions for limits on RVP of fuel where it can make a findingunder section 211(c)(4)(C) which would authorize EPA approval and, thus,eliminate the preemption problem. As set forth below, section 211(c)(4)(C)authorizes EPA to approve into the SIP a state-adopted fuel control measurethat has otherwise been preempted by final EPA action if EPA finds thatthe state control ``is necessary to achieve the standard'' that the SIPimplements. Section 211(c)(4)(C) of the Act, in setting forth the circumstances underwhich an exception to federal preemption of state regulation may occur,states:<ITAG tagnum="21">A State may prescribe and enforce, for purposes of motor vehicle emissioncontrol, a control or prohibition respecting the use of a fuel or fueladditive in a motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine if an applicable implementationplan for such State under section 110 so provides. The Administrator mayapprove such provision in an implementation plan, or promulgate an implementationplan containing such a provision, only if he finds that the State controlor prohibition is necessary to achieve the national primary or secondaryambient air quality standard which the plan implements.</ITAG>In the <T4>Federal Register </T4>discussion of EPA's approval of a state oxygenatedfuels program in the Maricopa County, Arizona SIP, EPA interpreted thislanguage as requiring the Agency to find that a fuel control requirementwas essential to achieve timely attainment of the standard. EPA said furtherthat a fuel control measure may be ``necessary'' for timely attainmentif no other measures that would bring about timely attainment exist, orif such other measures exist and are technically possible to implement,but are unreasonable or impracticable. Otherwise, no fuel control wouldever be `necessary,'' since for any area there is at least one measure_namely,required shutdowns and prohibitions on driving_that would result in timelyattainment of the NAAQS. It is doubtful that Congress would have intendedto bar EPA from approving State fuel controls into a SIP based on the availabilityof such drastic alternatives.\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ <T4>Federal Register </T4>August 10, 1988, 53 FR 30220, 30228.<ITAG tagnum="85">Evaluation of How the Connecticut Revision Satisfies the ``Necessary''Criterion </ITAG>The Connecticut submittal and related documents contain the state's analysisof the emission reductions that various measures would achieve and theremaining shortfall needed to achieve attainment. That analysis concludesthat the Connecticut RVP regulation would reduce VOC emissions by an estimated3900 tons per year (TPY). The quantity of reduction was derived from AP-42emission factors for storage and transfer of gasoline and from the EPAMOBILE 3 emission factor model for motor vehicle emissions. This estimatemay understate the actual reductions because it does not include the emissionsreductions that would result from decreased running losses from motor vehiclesassociated with lower volatility gasoline. Running losses are emissionsfrom the gasoline tank and fuel system that occur while a car is beingdriven and which result from an overload of the evaporative control systemor escape through the filler cap. Information available in the Connecticut SIP and the Reasonable FurtherProgress (REP) Report for 1987, along with supplemental inventory informationsubmitted by the state, were used in making the following findings. The1987 RFP report shows that Connecticut has achieved a 37% reduction ofVOC emissions on a statewide basis from 1980 emissions. Based on EPA'sexperience with Regional Oxidant Model runs for 1980 it seems likely thata reduction on the order of at least 60% from 1980 levels is needed forattainment of the ozone standard. Under this scenario, the emission reductionfrom 1987 levels needed for attainment translates to at least a 37% reductionfrom the 1987 inventory.The VOC strategies identified by the CT DEP as having the greatest potentialfor significant future VOC reductions are:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,tp0,i1,s25,7,7</C> <H1>Measure</H1><H1>Kg/day reduced</H1><H1>Percent of '87 inventory</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">RVP 11.5 to 9.0 psi<D>26,262</D><D>7.9</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Architectural Coatings<D>19,216</D><D>\1\ 5.8</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Consumer/Commercial Solvents<D>15,430</D><D>\1\ 4.7</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Stage II Controls<D>6724</D><D>3.5</D><R>n,n,s</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Total</ITAG><D/><D>21.9</D><F>\1\ Connecticut has assumed that it will likely only achieve 60% controlof 1987 inventory levels in these area source categories due to the difficultyof reformulating products or capturing area source emissions. Even if thesecategories were controlled to 100% in Connecticut there would still bea shortfall for attainment of the ozone standard.</F></ITAG> No other categories of available controls will individually yield reductionsof more than 0.5% of the 1987 inventory. The total of other available controlstrategies may reach 2%, which would yield approximately a 24% reductionin conjunction with the above controls. This still leaves at least a 13%VOC emission reduction shortfall. In order to make up this shortfall, thestate is considering changes to its motor vehicle inspection and maintenance(I/M) program along with other measures as part of the Post-1987 ozoneSIP planning process which will help reduce somewhat the shortfall. Reasonablyavailable I/M enhancements could produce an additional 2% emission reduction.Thus, even if such reasonably available I/M enhancements are implemented,a shortfall will still exist necessitating the implementation of othermeasures to achieve attainment. Even if EPA does promulgate an RVP regulationrequiring control to 10.5 psi in 1989, the state regulation will stillprovide additional reductions. No other measures that are clearly reasonablefor implementation in Connecticut could provide sufficient reductions toachieve attainment without the State RVP control. Thus Connecticut's RVP program appears to meet the appropriate test ofbeing ``necessary'' to achieve attainment of the ozone standard. The factthat the state RVP regulation might not by itself fill the remaining shortfalland hence by itself achieve the standard does not mean the rule would notbe ``necessary'' to achieve the standard within the meaning of section211(c)(4)(C). EPA believes that if Congress had intended EPA to approvea state fuel-content rule only if it were necessary <T3>and sufficient </T3>to achieve the standard then it would have usedthat language in section 211(c)(4)(C). EPA believes that the ``necessaryto achieve'' standard must be interpreted to apply to measures which areneeded to reduce ambient levels (thus bringing the area closer to achievingthe NAAQS) when no other reasonable measures are available to achieve thisreduction. A contrary application of ``necessary to achieve'' in this situationwould mean that measures which result in significantly improved air qualityare nonetheless unacceptable (even though no other reasonable measuresare available) just because they are insufficient to actually result inattainment.<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Action </ITAG>EPA is proposing to approve this revision to the Connecticut Ozone StateImplementation Plan to control gasoline volatility. EPA is also proposing to make a finding that this SIP revision meets therequirements of section 211(c)(4)(C) of the Act for an exception to federalpreemption. Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I certify that this SIP revision will not have asignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.(See 46 FR 8709.)
