Kuwaiti Defense Minister Sheik Nawaf Al-Ahmed signed anagreement with the Soviet deputy minister of foreign trade andeconomic relations, Gen. Yuri Grishin, that ``provides forsupplying Kuwait with certain military equipment,'' an officialannouncement in Kuwait on Sunday.   Neither Kuwaiti officials nor the Soviet Embassy would providedetails of the accord. The Kuwaiti announcement did not say whenthe accord was signed.   The Qatar government announced Sunday that it was establishingrelations with China, leaving Saudi Arabia and Bahrain the only twoArab states with which China lacks diplomatic ties.   The announcements were made by Kuwaiti and Qatari news agenciesand radio, monitored in Bahrain.   The People's Daily newspaper in Beijing said Sunday that Qatar'sambassador to France, Abdul Rahman Al-Attiyah, and his Chinesecounterpart, Zhou Jue, signed a document establishing relationsTuesday in France.   China has a history of good relations with the front-line Arabstates _ Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon _ and the PalestineLiberation Organization has a permanent mission in Beijing. Chinadoes not recognize Israel.   However, the pro-Western Arab states of the Gulf CooperationCouncil have moved slowly to recognize Communist China.   China established ties in 1971 with Kuwait, in 1978 with Omanand in 1984 with the United Arab Emirates. Qatar, Saudi Arabia andBahrain are the three other gulf council states.   Despite the absence of relations between Saudi Arabia, whichharbors Islam's holiest shrines, and the communist countries, theSaudi government recently purchased Chinese-made CSS-2surface-to-surface missiles from Beijing.   Kuwait had also signed a $325 million arms deal with the Sovietsin 1985, involving surface-to-air missiles.   It purchased the SAM-7 projectiles after the Congress blockedits bid to buy American Stinger missiles, complicating Kuwait'splan to boost its defenses against the spillovers of the 8-year-oldIran-Iraq war.   The Qatari and Kuwaiti announcements came as Kuwaiti CrownPrince Sheik Saad al-Abdullah Al-Sabah flew to Washington on anofficial visit.   Sheik Saad, who also is prime minister, is the first suchranking Kuwaiti leader to visit the United States since 1968.   During his stay, he was expected to try to conclude a $1.9million deal involving the purchase of 40 F-A-18 fighter-bombersand Maverick anti-ship and anti-tank missiles.</TEXT></DOC>
