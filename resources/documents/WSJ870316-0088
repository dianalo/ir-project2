In a letter to Supermarkets General's board on Friday, Herbert H. Haft and his son Robert, Dart's chairman and president respectively, urged the Woodbridge, N.J.-based food retailer to meet with Dart &quot;promptly.&quot;    The letter said, &quot;We are prepared to negotiate all terms of an acquisition agreement.&quot; In an interview yesterday, Robert Haft said these terms include the final price Dart would be willing to pay.    But a source close to Supermarkets General's deliberations indicated that the company desires to remain independent.    As previously reported, Dart made an unsolicited offer on March 6 to buy Supermarkets General for $41.75 a share. The Landover, Md.-based discount retailer said it was &quot;most interested,&quot; in a &quot;friendly&quot; transaction.    In composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, Supermarkets General closed at $43.25, up $1, indicating that investors expect a higher bid to emerge.    But since then, Supermarkets General, in apparent attempt to resist the bid, has been weighing its options. These include seeking another suitor, taking the company private, buying back some shares and making an acquisition of its own. Supermarkets General hasn't had any contact with Dart since last Monday, when it said it would consider the Dart offer, Mr. Haft said.    &quot;We're trying to assure that we are part of (Supermarkets General's decisionmaking) process,&quot; Mr. Haft said in the interview. &quot;We wouldn't want to wake up one morning and find out they had sold the company for $41.76 a share.&quot;    Mr. Haft said that &quot;to show good faith,&quot; Dart hasn't added to the 1.9 million Supermarkets General's shares it acquired earlier this year. That stake represents less than 5% of the food retailer's total shares outstanding.    Dart won't increase its stake &quot;while we are communicating and if we feel we are making progress in our discussions,&quot; Mr. Haft said.    But Mr. Haft didn't rule out the possibility of making a tender offer or buying more shares in the open market, if Supermarkets General declines to negotiate.    Some analysts have speculated that Dart might be more interested in putting Supermarkets General into play than in buying the company. They note that last year, after a bid for Safeway Stores Inc., the nation's largest supermarket chain, Dart made a profit of roughly $140 million on its Safeway holdings when the concern was acquired by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. in a leveraged buyout.    But Mr. Haft denied that Dart has any intentions of selling its shares back to Supermarkets General at a premium. &quot;We want to own the company,&quot; he said. &quot;Our shares our not for sale.&quot;    Robert E. Wunderle, vice president of public affairs for Supermarkets General, confirmed the company received what he characterized as a &quot;follow-up&quot; letter from the Hafts. &quot;There was nothing substantively new in it,&quot; he said. &quot;They urged us to discuss their proposal with them.&quot;    Mr. Wunderle said Supermarkets General intends to contact Dart today to acknowledge receipt of the letter. But he stressed that the Dart proposal is still being studied by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., which was retained by the food retailer as soon as it received the unsolicited offer.    &quot;We're really not in any position to formally respond to the proposal until we receive Shearson's report back,&quot; he said. Added a source close to the Supermarkets General deliberations: &quot;It's preposterous to think you can sit down and talk about selling or restructuring $1.6 billion in assets in a few days. Shearson needs time to look at all the alternatives.&quot;    The source close to the deliberations emphasized there has been &quot;no change&quot; in Supermarkets General's thinking. &quot;There remains the strong desire to stay independent and they (Supermarkets General) are exploring all the options in light of the Dart offer.&quot;    Mr. Wunderle said the company's stock closed on Friday above the bid price because of a televised report that indicated that Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., a New York firm specializing in leveraged buyouts, proposed to take Supermarkets General private for $45 a share. &quot;We aren't aware of any proposal by KKR,&quot; Mr. Wunderle said.    In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company largely with debt that ultimately is paid with funds generated by the acquired company. </TEXT></DOC>
