The equation has a compact kernel.Knowing the breakup amplitude into three free particles, the asymptoticform for the breakup channel in configuration space can be studied. Itturns out that the standard asymptotic form is achieved within a fewpercent only if the particles are separated by a few thousands of fm's.</TEXT></DOC>
