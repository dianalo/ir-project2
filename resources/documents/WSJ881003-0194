But prices could rebound quickly as expectations mount over a new round of critical OPEC meetings scheduled to begin soon. In any case, October already is shaping up as the year's pivotal month for the oil market. And the outcome is likely to decide whether there will be a full replay of the price collapse of 1986, or a price recovery like the one that occurred at the end of that year.    Traders on Friday slashed most crude oil prices by 50 cents a barrel or more, dropping them to levels not seen since the summer of 1986. The decline sent stock and bond prices higher in the U.S. -- though stocks later softened -- and sent gold and the dollar lower.    Friday's oil-price plunge began in Tokyo and continued in London and New York in response to a report in this newspaper of a surge in OPEC output led by Saudi Arabia. Then came a Dow Jones International News Service report of an interview with OPEC's secretary-general, Subroto.    The former Indonesian oil minister warned that oil could fall to $5 a barrel if Saudi Arabia fully exploited its production capacity to force other OPEC members to honor their production quotas, and &quot;the market just collapsed,&quot; as a Shearson Lehman Hutton Ltd. oil trader said in London.    Spot prices of the widely traded North Sea Brent crude fell 45 cents to 50 cents a barrel to just above $12 on European spot markets, only to drop an additional 16 cents in U.S. trading. On the New York Mercantile Exchange the benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude opened weak and then plummeted in lively trading after Subroto's comments were reported. For November delivery, the crude closed at $13.37 a barrel, down 55 cents.    &quot;The last time we saw a spot-month close that low was in August 1986,&quot; said a Nymex spokesman.    Hardly by coincidence, OPEC's output has just reached its highest level since that same month just over two years ago, at 20.6 million barrels a day.    In the interview, Subroto expressed concern that Saudi Arabia may flood world oil markets if other members of OPEC don't restrict their rising output. If the Saudis used all their prodigious capacity, he said, that could lead to oil prices of $5 a barrel or less -- even below those of 1986, when some Mideast crudes sold for as little as $7.    The Subroto statement shocked the industry and oil markets already reeling from OPEC's apparent inability to curb runaway production. &quot;Oh, my goodness,&quot; a U.S. consultant to some OPEC countries exclaimed when informed of the comment.    Nevertheless, many oil specialists said the price plunge that these developments triggered could help OPEC finally come to grips with the oil glut -- perhaps with the cooperation of non-OPEC oil exporters -- and eventually turn around the bearish oil market.    &quot;We definitely needed this crash, if we are to expect anything from OPEC,&quot; said Vahan Zanoyan, senior director of Washington-based Petroleum Finance Co.    He said the developments should get the 13 OPEC nations &quot;to finally pull together&quot; in curbing output. He said agreement might be reached at OPEC meetings in October and November on quotas totaling as much as 19 million barrels a day -- higher than the current theoretical ceiling of 17.5 million barrels but lower than actual current production.    Mr. Zanoyan is among the several traders and analysts who say prices could fall an additional $1 a barrel in the next three weeks. But, he said, &quot;If this new total quota scheme happens, even at 19 million, I can easily see a $2 or $3 rally in oil prices, bringing WTI (West Texas Intermediate) back up close to $16.&quot;    However, he said, there is also a danger a rally could come prematurely -- developing as soon as word of a possible OPEC agreement leaks out. If the rally should come before OPEC &quot;regroups,&quot; he said, it would jeopardize oil markets again. &quot;Then the big crash comes in November,&quot; he said.    It may be wishful thinking, but some in the oil industry are saying that the price bottom for this year may have already been reached. William Davis, an Oklahoma City-based independent oil operator, said U.S. producers are beginning to close down wells again because of low prices. That in turn could mean some tightening of supplies for U.S. refiners, firming crude prices. Mr. Davis said he himself has recently closed 30 to 40 oil wells.    Others look for continued volatility in prices but in a relatively narrow range, with possibly some firming until 1989. Joseph Stanislaw, a managing director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, foresees a &quot;modest lift in oil prices in the fourth quarter&quot; but &quot;downward price pressure in early 1989.&quot;    Philip K. Verleger Jr., visiting fellow at the Institute for International Economics who has written books on oil-price behavior, is even more pessimistic about prices in next year's first half. He said OPEC overproduction now is &quot;borrowing&quot; demand from next year.    Additionally, Mr. Verleger said, &quot;what people are losing sight of is that demand for OPEC oil is always the lowest in February and March.&quot; As a result, he said, &quot;we could be in for a period of very low oil prices for the next six to nine months.&quot;    For his part, OPEC's Subroto looks for further price weakness between now and December. &quot;We may see a further decline in prices through a . . . mutual overproduction,&quot; he said in the interview.    The secretary-general also said that talks among oil exporters on a new price and production program may take longer than expected, that OPEC is likely to face a weak world oil market for years to come and that if prices fall below $10 or $11 a barrel, industrial countries may start imposing oil-import fees. </TEXT></DOC>
