Foreign-exchange traders attributed the dollar's mild recovery to the covering of short-dollar positions by participants eager to lock in profits from the currency's recent decline.    They cautioned that prospects for the U.S. currency remain poor in the near future because of the potential for a new round of interest-rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve and concern that the slowing economy may trip into a recession.    In late afternoon New York trading, the dollar was at 1.8588 marks, up from 1.8510 marks Tuesday, and at 136.65 yen, up from 135.90 yen. The pound was at $1.6552, down from $1.6650.    In Tokyo Thursday, the dollar opened for trading at 136.72 yen, up from Wednesday's Tokyo close of 136.20 yen.    Tuesday's late dollar-selling spree carried over into early Asian trading yesterday. The U.S. currency fell to almost 1.8430 marks before the appearence of new buyers triggered profit-taking by participants who had sold dollars during the currency's decline in the past few days.    The release of two relatively minor economic indicators, U.S. new home sales and factory orders, had little effect on the day's trading, dealers said.    Although home sales climbed higher than expected, the gains are largely a product of the lower interest rates that have been hampering the dollar, said Jeff Mondschein, managing director of foreign exchange at Continental Bank in Chicago. Therefore, the increase is as much a signal of how far interest rates have fallen as it is a suggestion of increased economic activity, he said. Sales of new single-family houses rose 5.5% in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 670,000, following a revised 4.3% rise in the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 635,000. Economists, on average, had expected a 1.1% rise in home sales.    New factory orders in June rose 0.4% to a seasonally adjusted $234.56 billion, an expansion from the revised decrease of 2.6% in May and close enough to the predicted 0.3% to leave the market unflustered.    Likewise, the index of U.S. leading indicators for June, to be announced today, isn't expected to have much impact on foreign-exchange dealings. The index, which is expected to have fallen 0.2%, is overshadowed by the employment report, traders said.    James McGroarty, senior vice president of foreign exchange at Greenwich Capital Markets in Greenwich, Conn., said the leading indicators &quot;generally aren't a barometer of Fed monetary policy,&quot; which is the overriding focus of market participants now.    Traders said it would be premature to be concerned that the employment data will lead the Fed to trigger a new reduction in the federal funds rate, after a quarter-point easing last week.    The employment figures are expected to show 158,000 additions to non-farm payrolls and an unemployment rate unchanged from June at 5.3%.    Mr. McGroarty predicted that non-farm payrolls would have to grow by significantly less than 125,000 before the Fed would consider another easing so soon. In addition, Mr. Mondschein said the Fed has to take more time to assess its recent series of interest rate cuts to ensure inflation won't rekindle.    Meanwhile, the Canadian dollar continued to benefit from the perception that it is the least troubled high-yielding currency, traders said. The U.S. dollar slipped to 1.1753 Canadian dollars at the New York finish, down from 1.1761 Canadian dollars Tuesday.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell 70 cents to $370.10 an ounce in light trading. Estimated volume was 2.2 million ounces.    In early trading in Hong Kong Thursday, gold was quoted at $369.70 an ounce. </TEXT></DOC>
