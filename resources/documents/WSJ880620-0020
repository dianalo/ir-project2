The plan, approved by the board Friday afternoon, provides for 100% payment to creditors of Allegheny's main operating subsidiaries: Sunbeam, Almet/Lawnlite and Chemetron Corp. Unsecured creditors of the parent company will receive &quot;varying percentages of their claims&quot; in cash, notes and common stock. The plan passed 8-to-4, with dissident shareholder representatives voting against it. Allegheny in February filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, which allowed it to continue to operate with protection from creditor suits while working out a plan to pay debt.    The reorganization plan, to be filed with the bankruptcy court today, is central to the battle for the majority of the company's 13-member board. Allegheny shareholders meet this morning to elect seven directors.    Dissident shareholder Spear, Leeds andamp; Kellogg, a New York brokerage firm, had hoped to elect its slate of seven directors before the plan was fashioned. At today's election, Spear Leeds is virtually guaranteed three seats, while the company needs only one of its four nominees to be elected to retain a simple majority.    Allegheny officials said the company plan would serve as a &quot;benchmark&quot; for other reorganization proposals for the concern. Several major investors, including Los Angeles financier David H. Murdock, New York investor Bennett S. LeBow and Remington Products Inc. Chairman Victor Kiam, have indicated interest in drafting reorganization plans. However, the company has asked the bankruptcy court for a 180-day &quot;exclusivity&quot; period, which, if granted, means no competing plan could be approved during that time.    Allegheny officials stressed that shareholders must approve management's plan and that a speedy resolution was important to insure the ongoing operations of the company's profitable consumer products operations.    The announcement of the plan didn't surprise Spear Leeds officials, who expected management to rush the plan before today's annual meeting. Allegheny had until June 30 to come up with a reorganization plan.    David P. Nolan, Spear Leeds managing director, blasted the proposal for reducing shareholder ownership to 25% of the reorganized company. He said preferred and preference stock would be swapped for 15% of a new issue of common stock, while existing common shareholders would receive 10% of the new common stock. The remaining 75% of the common stock would go to the unsecured creditors. The value of the new securities wasn't disclosed.    Under the company's plan, shareholders would also receive at least 50% of proceeds from a suit filed by Allegheny's unsecured creditors against the company's main lenders. The suit, seeking $1.3 billion in damages, said strict credit terms forced the company to sell assets at &quot;fire sale&quot; prices.    Mr. Nolan said that if Spear Leeds representatives gain control of the board, they would try to reduce the &quot;exclusivity&quot; period and invite investors to modify the reorganization plan.    &quot;We want to put this in an auction situation where Murdock, Kiam and LeBow and any other interested party can have input and offer the highest price for assets,&quot; he said. &quot;Then let the board determine what is the proper thing to do.&quot;    Both the company and Spear Leeds are confident about emerging as winners in today's proxy fight. In recent weeks, Minneapolis investor Irwin Jacobs, with his 7.3% voting stake, has aligned himself with Spear Leeds, which controls another 7.3% of the votes. Mr. Murdock, controlling 1.5% of the votes, has backed management and the Gabelli group, which controls about 4.3% of the votes, is also expected to side with management nominees. </TEXT></DOC>
