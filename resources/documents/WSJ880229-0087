It is the nation's third-fastest-growing metropolitan area; it is the nation's second-poorest core city. It is a magnet for executives on the make and for the poor from the country.    It is &quot;Hotlanta&quot;: capital city of the South at a time when the South has risen; city of myriad services at a time when the service economy rules; city of the 1980s, more suburban than downtown, more footloose than fixed. If New York is the Big Apple and New Orleans the Big Easy, Atlanta is the Big Hustle.    One of Greater Atlanta's biggest industries is growth. In becoming the nation's seventh-largest builder of offices, it deploys legions of brokers, lawyers and mortgage bankers. In leading the nation the past three years in new single-family housing permits, it has gladdened scores of real-estate agents, architects and marketers. Other than buildings, however, Atlanta produces very little. That gives the economy here a rather ethereal air.    But there is no arguing with the numbers. From 1980 to 1986, Atlanta was the nation's third-fastest-growing metropolitan area, jumping 20% in population to 2.6 million. From 1982 to 1987, it led all major metropolitan areas in job growth rate, nearly doubling the U.S. pace. From the 20th-largest metropolitan area in 1970, it has risen to 10th-largest now.    Understand, there is a world of difference between Atlanta the city and Atlanta the metropolitan area. The city has the big-name brand -- it is Coca-Cola Co.'s headquarters -- and the big-league teams, albeit mostly bad ones. But the metropolitan area is what the Big Hustle is really all about. The suburbs produce new jobs at five times the city's pace. They include the nation's fastest-growing large county -- Gwinnett -- while the city's population shrinks.    Understand, too, that some people here are holding their breath. A Sun Belt star can be a shooting one, as Houston demonstrated after the oil debacle. Metropolitan Atlanta itself flickered in the 1970s, after a speculative building binge, and has seen its '80s growth pace slow in the past year.    It insists it is crash-proof now, more diversified and more stable than it was in the past decade. Still, it may be heading from an era of breakneck acceleration to a time of trying to find its cruising speed.    It does sit on a far more solid foundation than Houston, however, since it is based not on a commodity but on being the crossroads of a region. It has only nine Fortune 500 industrial companies of its own, but 400 of the others have regional offices here. From these offices, latter-day Willy Lomans fly out of the world's busiest airport each day to market to the nation's fastest-growing region. And each day people fly in from around the South, to hustle credit from the region's biggest banks, huddle at the region's biggest law firms, and haggle at the region's biggest buyers' marts.    &quot;It's as though the Southeast is a huge parabolic mirror and the business energy is focused on Atlanta,&quot; says Sam A. Williams, executive vice president of Portman Companies, which operates the marts.    Greater Atlanta has come to bestride the region through Hartsfield International Airport and the sheer force of boosterism. It called that airport the world's busiest well before it was (and even now it is only sort of the busiest -- Chicago's O'Hare handles more passengers though Hartsfield has more flights). It called itself an international city when its only claim to that was Coke exports. Even today, it is a city where the downtown sidewalks roll up around dusk, the hottest cultural issue is a nude-dancing ban and the most famous writer is a good-ole-boy newspaper columnist. But the facts never stop Atlanta. It preens, plots, presses ever forward, until even its lies come true.    And, increasingly, it leaves its poor behind. Atlanta's growth is a mostly white-collar phenomenon, making it a cruel mirage for the unskilled and unemployed drawn here from around the region. The New South's Gotham looks increasingly like the old North's: a bifurcated land of plenty and poverty. When the Democrats pick a presidential candidate here in July, delegates will find shanty homes nearly in the shadow of the convention center.    They will have a harder time finding the history they have read about in &quot;Gone With the Wind,&quot; for it is mostly gone with the wrecking ball. Developers have marched through Atlanta like Sherman, making over the Confederate stronghold into a confederation of generic office towers and shopping centers. &quot;Atlanta's a boom town, focused on the present and future and not very interested in the past,&quot; says Eileen Segrest, the leader of the city's oft-losing preservationists. &quot;But the sense of place is being chipped away.&quot;    And if the Big Hustle's growth has swept out its past, it has outrun its infrastructure. Atlanta's mass-transit system outshines those of other Sun Belt cities, and its interstate arteries can pump through a lot of traffic, thanks in part to the largess of the Carter administration. But uglification is rampant, water shortages loom and suburban traffic is gridlocked, as a crazy quilt of 42 municipal governments does little to control growth. In the South's smaller boom cities, like Nashville and Charlotte, the standard line is, &quot;We don't want to be another Atlanta.&quot;    &quot;They're lying,&quot; says Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young, who, in the tradition of mayors here, doesn't so much run the city as promote it. William B. Hartsfield, the mayor of the '40s and '50s, talked the postal service into making Atlanta the Southern hub for the nascent air-mail system. Ivan Allen Jr., the mayor of the '60s, testified for civil-rights measures while Birmingham's Bull Connor tore into civil-rights demonstrators.    Thus, Atlanta could market itself as &quot;the city too busy to hate,&quot; and it began to draw Yankees by the score. Northern companies now had to have offices in the growing South, and with its racial harmony, good flight connections, and fortunate location above the &quot;gnat belt,&quot; Atlanta became the base of choice. Once Birmingham's equal in size and stature, it began to rapidly pull away as the region's kingpin.    It has evolved into the hub of what SunTrust Banks Inc. economist Wayne D. Gantt calls &quot;the radial economy&quot;: an exporter of services, an importer of talent and the nerve center of a region. Atlanta has three &quot;super-regional&quot; banks, commanding multistate empires; three interstate highways, making it a major distribution center; and one major convention hall, in which the Democrats' bash will be only the fourth biggest this year.    In the age of the service economy, Greater Atlanta has everything to do with information-processing, deal-making, marketing and managing. Its biggest employer is the airport. Its office employment is 20% greater than the average U.S. city's. Its manufacturing accounts for only 14% of its employment.    In a nation whose economy counts on free-spending consumers, Atlanta's is juiced by the shop-till-you drop kind. They troll through 347 shopping centers, giving Greater Atlanta 23% more store space per capita than the average U.S. city. The stores have racked up 14% annual retail sales increases since 1983, excluding autos, three times the national clip. And autos? Atlanta has the nation's top-volume Volvo dealer, its No. 2 BMW dealer, its No. 8 Porsche dealer and one of its top 10 Mercedes dealers.    But all this activity has led to some major overbuilding. The office vacancy rate has reached 21%; the rate in some suburban strip shopping centers is up to 40%. And it will take an estimated 18 months to sell all the new luxury megahouses on the market, a truly mega-inventory.    So builders have begun to apply the brakes. Office construction starts were slashed more than half last year, new multifamily permits by 40%. Metropolitan Atlanta, which averaged 76,000 new jobs a year from 1984 to 1986, dropped to a 44,000 gain last year and a projected 33,000 this year. The slowdown raises the specter of the 1970s, when Atlanta overbuilt, then busted. The nervous consensus: It can't happen again. Atlanta's premier economist, Donald Ratajczak, calls the slowdown a mere correction. &quot;We've had a big run,&quot; he says, &quot;and you're bound to develop some excesses.&quot;    Yet for many here, excess is hardly the problem. In the land of the megahouse, at least 6,000 people are homeless. In a land of 600 new restaurants a year, 27,000 people lined up for free meals last Christmas. In the core city, more than a quarter of the people fell below the federal poverty line as of the 1980 census, a rate second only to that of Newark, N.J.    Some argue that Atlanta looks worse than warranted by such gauges as the poverty line because the core city is small and, unlike many cities, can't legally annex more affluent areas. But the fact is that the inner city's blue-collar and unskilled have been left out of the boom. Manufacturing jobs declined 22% in Atlanta's home county of Fulton between 1970 and 1984; jobs requiring less than a high-school education declined by 6%.    The left-out people don't qualify for the kind of employment that is being created in Fulton, where jobs requiring some college education increased 40% between 1970 and 1984. &quot;Every time there's a drought in South Georgia or a textile mill closes in Alabama, you can see a new wave coming into the Greyhound station,&quot; says Dan E. Sweat Jr., the president of Central Atlanta Progress, a civic group. &quot;They think this is the land of milk and honey, but they aren't qualified to work in our white-collar jobs.&quot;    These migrants, together with the more longstanding poor, are creating problems hitherto better known to Northern slums. Murders are committed in core-city Atlanta at five times the national rate. Drug trafficking has turned violent with the entry of an outfit called the &quot;Miami Boys.&quot; Housing is in a crisis, with the poor being pushed out of gentrifying neighborhoods and widely unable to get into public housing, where 11% of the units are boarded up. It has all the makings of a big permanent underclass right in the midst of the Big Hustle.    While Atlanta's elite gathered last month to honor the late Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. at a black-tie dinner, the dispossessed held a dollar-a-plate &quot;poor people's banquet&quot; nearby. They listened to Mr. King on a boom box, and they heard the fete's sponsor, City Councilman Hosea Williams, talk of the dream, for many here more distant than ever. &quot;Atlanta has allowed some blacks to slip through to prosperity,&quot; Mr. Williams says, &quot;but the masses are much worse off.&quot;    ---                    Where Atlanta Stands   Large metropolitan areas with fastest job growth rates, 1982-97                                          Annual Growth Rate    Atlanta                                        5.7%    Anaheim-Santa Ana, Calif.                      5.6    Washington, D.C.                               4.6    Detroit                                        3.9    Minneapolis-St. Paul                           3.7   Metropolitan areas with fastest population growth, 1980-86                                          Percent Increase    Phoenix                                       25.9%    Dallas-Fort Worth                             24.7    Atlanta                                       19.8    San Antonio                                   19.1    Tampa-St. Petersburg                          18.6   Large cities with highest poverty rates    Newark, N.J.                                  32.8%    Atlanta                                       27.5    Miami                                         24.5    Baltimore                                     22.9    Cleveland                                     22.1   Sources: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics; Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates; Salomon Brothers Inc.; U.S. Census Bureau</TEXT></DOC>
