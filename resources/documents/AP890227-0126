No serious injuries were reported, but dissidents said about 70people were detained.   A major clash broke out in Seoul when about 700 radical studentsand dissidents, throwing rocks and firebombs, battled riot policearound Dongguk University.   ``Bush go home!'' and ``Down with military dictatorship!''protesters shouted, as they began a march to the U.S. Embassy, threemiles away.   The protesters, carrying red and blue flags, tried to march intothe streets after a rally on campus, where they burned effigies ofBush and South Korean President Roh Tae-woo. Marchers beating drumsled the procession.   ``Drive out the imperialist Yankees and their military regime!''a radical leader screamed. Protesters applauded and took up thechant.   Other radical leaders denounced Bush and the United States,charging that Washington keeps troops in South Korea to enforce acolonial-style rule. About 42,000 U.S. troops are stationed in SouthKorea under a mutual defense treaty.   Dozens of protesters surged from the pack and hurled firebombs atriot police, touching off vicious fighting that lasted 45 minutes.Several officers were set afire after being hit by firebombs, butthe flames were extinguished quickly.   Bush, in Seoul for a brief visit on his way home from China andJapan, moved around the capital by helicopter and was not near theviolence. The government mobilized 20,000 riot police in centralSeoul to block protests.   Anti-Americanism was a casual subject in the conversation betweenBush and Roh before they started formal talks, and Bush asked whyeven a small number of Korean students staged violent protests,officials said.   Roh replied there is a small group of radicals who subscribe tocommunist ideology and class struggle, the officials said. Therealso is a group of people who believe South Korea is subservient tothe United States, they said.   In the southern city of Kwangju, hundreds of radicals fought withriot police firing tear gas. Clashes also were reported in Kunsan,Taegu, Pusan and Chongju.   Police broke up an attempt by prominent dissident leaders tomarch to the U.S. Embassy to deliver a letter addressed to Bushdemanding an end to the U.S. military presence in South Korea.   About 15 dissident leaders shouting slogans and carrying picturesof Bush with red crosses drawn through them were hauled away aftertrying to assemble about a block from the embassy in downtown Seoul.   ``No Bush visit!'' the small band shouted before they wereoverwhelmed by charging police, who kicked and punched some of theprotesters.   Minutes after the protest, Bush's helicopter passed overhead onits way to the presidential mansion, the Blue House, to meet Roh.   Hundreds of riot police ringed the U.S. Embassy and other U.S.facilities because of radicals' threats to hold anti-Americanprotests. Police stepped up street checks on pedestrians downtown.   The letter to Bush, released by the nation's main dissidentalliance, called for the withdrawal of all U.S. forces from SouthKorea and charged that Washington ruled the nation like a colony.   ``U.S.A. is the source of all suppression and sorrow to Koreanpeople since the division of the Korean peninsula,'' the letter said.   The letter accused the United States of dividing the Koreanpeninsula and keeping troops in South Korea to prevent itsreunification with North Korea. It also denounced Washington forseeking greater access for U.S. imports to South Korea.   Radicals say Roh's government is a military dictatorshipcontrolled by the United States.   Radical students have little public support because of theirviolent and extreme views, but they can assemble thousands ofactivists and often clash with riot police.</TEXT></DOC>
