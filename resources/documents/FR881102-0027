L. 100-86). 53 FR 19373 (May 27, 1988). In keeping with theBoard's view that the Act established a clear link between the time itnormally takes a check to be cleared and returned, and the time withinwhich the depositary bank \1\<NOTE/> must make the funds available to the depositor, the regulationsprovided that where a check is payable by one bank but payable through\2\<NOTE/> another and sent to the payable through bank for paymentor collection, the location of the payable through bank would determinewhether a check is local or nonlocal vis-a-vis the despostary bank forthe purposes of the funds availability schedules in the regulation.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The Act uses the term ``receiving depository institution''to mean ``the branch of a depository institution or the proprietary ATMin which a check is first deposited.'' 12 U.S.C. 4001(20). Because theterm ``receiving depository institution'' is unique to the Act, the Boardused the term ``depositary bank,'' which, because it is used in the UniformCommercial Code (``U.C.C.'') and the Board's Regulation J (12 CFR Part210), is familiar to the banking industry.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ When a check states on its face that it is ``payable through''a bank, that bank is referred to as the ``payable through bank.'' Underthe U.C.C., a payable through bank is not named as the payor, but is designatedas a ``collecting bank to make presentment.'' U.C.C. andSection; 3-120. Underthe Board's Regulation J, a payable through bank is the ``paying bank.''12 CFR 210.2(j).  Shortly after the Board issued Regulation CC, a trade association of creditunions and one credit union whose checks are payable through a nonlocalbank filed suit against the Board seeking to overturn the definition ofpaying bank to the extent that the definition included a payable throughbank where the check was drawn on a credit union. The court granted theplaintiffs' motion for a summary judgment and invalidated Regulation CC'sdefinition of paying bank to the extent that it includes a payable throughbank where the check is drawn on a credit union. <T3>Credit Union National Association</T3> v. <T3>Board of Governors</T3>, No. 88-1295 OG (D.D.C. July 28, 1988). Thecourt found that the Board's regulation was inconsistent with the Act tothe extent that it defined the payable through bank as the paying bankfor purposes of the Act's funds availability requirements.  The Act and Regulation CC took effect five weeks after the court renderedits decision. In order to clarify the duties of banks and others in lightof the court's order, the Board issued temporary conforming amendmentsto Regulation CC. The Board also requested comment on the interim rulespending the Board's consideration of a final rule. 53 FR 31290 (August18, 1988).  The interim rule primarily affected the definitions and the disclosurerules. Where a check is payable by one bank but payable through anotherbank, the interim rule provided that the check would be considered localor nonlocal by reference to the location of the payor bank, not by referenceto the payable through bank. The interim rule did not affect payable throughchecks payable by nonbank payors. Further, as payable through checks bearthe routing number of the payable through bank, not the payor, provisionsin Regulation CC that allowed a depositary bank to rely on the routingnumber to determine whether a check is local or nonlocal were amended.The interim rule also permitted banks whose initial disclosures were affectedby the court's decision to comply with the Act by sending to their customerssimple clarifying notices in regularly scheduled meetings.  Approximately 93 percent of the 155 comments the Board received on theinterim rule objected to the treatment of bank payable through checks aslocal or nonlocal based on the location of the payor bank, because therule creates operational difficulties and increases risks for depositarybanks. Many of the commenters suggested means of addressing these operationalproblems and risks. In a related action today, the Board has requestedcomment on several proposals to alleviate these operational problems andrisks. (See Docket No. R-0648.)  After consideration of the comments, the Board has determined to adoptin final form the interim rule with two technical changes:  (1) To insert the word ``or'' after the fourth element in the definitionof ``paying bank,'' and (2) Clarify in the disclosure rules and the Commentary that a bank thatmakes funds available within the time periods required for local checksis not required to make the special disclosure.  <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 229  </ITAG>Banks, Banking, Federal Reserve System. Accordingly, the interim rule amending Regulation CC, 12 CFR Part 229,which was published at 53 FR 31290-31296 on August 18, 1988, is adoptedas a final rule with the following changes:  <ITAG tagnum="56">PART 229_AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS AND COLLECTION OF CHECKS  </ITAG>1.
