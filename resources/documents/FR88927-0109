Also, a customer survey was conducted of Bass' naturalgas customers. Plaintiff provided additional comments on the new materialand complained about alleged inconsistencies in the Department's investigationswith respect to the increased import criterion for the Santa Fe Mineralsand Coseka Resources petitions compared to the petition submitted by theformer workers of Bass Enterprises Production Company.One requirement for the certification of workers for adjustment assistanceis increased imports of articles like or directly competitive with thearticles produced by the workers' firm or appropriate subdivision. However,in order for a worker group to become certified as eligible to apply foradjustment assistance it must also meet the other two group eligibilityrequirements of section 222 of the Trade Act of 1974.Petitioners sometimes allege inconsistencies in the Department's determinationsespecially when the Department certifies workers of one firm and deniesworkers at other firms producing the same articles in the same base period.The Department's policy is that if workers are not separately identifiableby product, and the product impacted by imports represents an importantportion of the production of the firm or appropriate subdivision, thenall workers would be certified as eligible to apply for adjustment assistance.Investigation findings show that Santa Fe Minerals, Coseka Resoures andBass Enterprises produced both natural gas and crude oil and the workerswere not separately identifiable by product. In the Santa Fe case, crude oil production accounted for a major portionof total production and workers met all three group eligibility requirementsfor crude oil in 1986. Therefore, there was no need to survey the naturalgas customers. On the other hand, in the Coseka case, natural gas productionaccounted for a major portion of total production. Coseka's certificationwas based primarily on the fact that workers producing natural gas metall three group eligibility requirements in 1985.With respect to the Bass petition, investigation findings show that Basswas primarily a crude oil producer with natural gas accounting for an importantportion of total production. Investigation findings for Bass showed increasedsales and production of crude oil for 1985 and 1986. Accordingly, thereis no need for a customer survey of Bass' crude oil customers since theworkers could not meet all three group eligibility criteria. On reconsideration,the Department surveyed the natural gas customers of Bass Enterprises.The survey findings show that the customers with declining purchases fromBass in 1985 of 1986 did not import natural gas. As a general practice,the Department does not survey secondary customers of firms since the findingswould be too remote and indirect to support the contributed importantlycriterion.Also new findings on reconsideration show that Bass Enterprises replacedgeologists and geophysicists with contract employees_geological consultants_performingthese servcies.With respect to the decreased sales and/or production criterion, the Departmentused quantity data since it is a more reliable indicator than value tomeasure decreases or increases in production or sales. (See: <T3>Former Employees of Asarco's Amarillo Copper Refinery </T3>vs. <T3>Secretary of Labor, </T3>(675 F. Supp 647 (CIT 1987)).Also, there is no purpose in viewing U.S. imports of crude oil or naturalgas (by quarters) prior to the Bass workers separations beginning in September1985 since the workers do not meet the decreased production or sales criterionfor crude oil. U.S. imports of crude oil decreased in every quarter in1985 prior to the beginning of worker separations (September 10, 1985)compared to the same quarter in 1984. Likewise, there is no purpose inviewing U.S. imports of natural gas (by quarters) just prior to the Bassworkers initial separations since the import data show that U.S. importsof natural gas increased in 1985. The ``contributed importantly'' testof the increased import criterion, however, was not met for natural gassince Bass' customers did not shift purchases from Bass to foreign sources.Lastly, the allegation by petitioners concerning the natural gas customersof Coseka and Bass Enterprises is merely speculation and is unsupportedby the record.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion</ITAG>After reconsideration on remand, I reaffirm the original denial of eligibilityto apply for adjustment assistance to workers of Bass Enterprises ProductionCompany, Fort Worth, Texas.<ITAG tagnum="21">Signed at Washington, DC, this 19th day of September 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Stephen A.
