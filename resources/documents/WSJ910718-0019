Man International Futures Inc. inNew York. &quot;The market was very powerful.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude for Augustdelivery settled at $22.14 a barrel, up 49 cents. Gasolinealso surged, with the August contract advancing 1.34 cents agallon to 64.66 cents.   In addition, the Marathon unit of USX Corp. raised theprice it will pay for West Texas Intermediate crude by 50cents a barrel to $21. At least one other major refinerboosted its price, too.   Traders said much of the activity stemmed from the weeklyinventory report by the American Petroleum Institute onTuesday. The API said that gasoline inventories declined bytwo million barrels in the week ended July 12 and that crudestocks dropped by 1.4 million barrels.   Robert Boslego, president of the consulting firm BoslegoCorp., added that reduced gasoline imports and a drop inrefinery production contributed to yesterday's rally.&quot;Overall, the trends in gasoline production and imports arefalling while gasoline demand continues to rise,&quot; he said.   In the past month, Mr. Boslego said, gasoline demand hasbeen less than 1% below last year, compared with 2% to 3%lower at times earlier in the year. The industry had beenexpecting weaker demand at this point in the summer becauseof the recession, he said.   Market speculation in the past week that the U.S. wouldsoon take some form of military action against Iraq hasprovided underlying support to crude prices. Although therewasn't any specific news yesterday, the rumors havepersisted.   Heating-oil contracts fell earlier in the day because of a4.3-million-barrel rise in inventories in the latest week.But yesterday's rally eventually carried heating oil upwardsas well.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Soybean futures prices declined on anextended weather forecast predicting the possibility of rainnext week. The extended forecast calls for more normalweather patterns for this time of year than the Midwest andMississippi Delta growing regions have encountered recently.The weather this week has been extraordinarily hot and dry.Corn futures prices were propped up by ideas circulatingamong traders that the hot weather already has done somedamage to the corn crop, which is less resilient thansoybeans. In addition, the Soviet Union bought an additionalone million metric tons of corn from the U.S. A metric ton isequal to about 2,204.62 pounds. The price of the soybeancontract for November delivery fell 7.5 cents to $5.415 abushel, while the December corn contract rose 1.5 cents to$2.4075 a bushel.                                                                                                          COFFEE: Mexican coffee exporters proposed for discussionlater this week at a Mexico summit meeting ofSpanish-speaking nations, a plan to boost sagging coffeeprices, said Judith Ganes, senior analyst at Merrill Lynch.The proposal suggests empowering the International CoffeeOrganization to buy coffee, rather than administer exportquotas, she said. The cocoa industry tried a similar program,she noted, and &quot;is still suffering from it.&quot; TheInternational Cocoa Organization couldn't buy enough tosupport prices, she said, and ran out of money. Questions offinancing a coffee-buying plan and issues of control alsoraise sticky problems, she added. Other countries areconsidering alternative systems, such as programs requiringcoffee growers to retain a certain amount of coffee for eachbag exported, but they're short-term measures that haveproven ineffectual in the past, she said. Coffee forSeptember delivery ended 1.05 cents a pound higher at 84.15cents.                                                                                                          CRB FUTURES INDEX: The index of 21 futures prices isrebounding from its recent low of 205.04 last week.Yesterday, the index gained 1.08 points to end at 210.09. Therebound isn't surprising because many of the commodities inthe index have been oversold, said John Murphy, president ofJJM Technical Advisors of Oradell, N.J. But, he added, he'snot convinced the markets have bottomed. A rise above 218would be encouraging, he said, but to send a strong signalthat commodity prices are out of their downward trend, theindex would have to rise above 223. &quot;Right now, I'm inclinedto treat this as more of a bear-market rally,&quot; he said.</TEXT></DOC>
