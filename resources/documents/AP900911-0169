The non-binding resolution, passed on a 97-2 vote, declared thatSaddam ``has violated standards of civilized conduct by willfullyseeking to endanger the lives of foreign civilians in Kuwait andIraq.''   The resolution was passed just hours before President Bush wasappearing before a joint House and Senate session to report on thecrisis triggered by Saddam's invasion and occupation of neighboringKuwait.   ``It is the sense of the Senate that in the event of hostilitiesbetween the United States and the government of Iraq, it shall bethe policy of the United States to pursue Saddam Hussein and othersuch perpetrators as may be determined responsible in order tobring them to justice as war criminals,'' it said.   Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., the principal sponsor, told hiscolleagues ``the most important way that we can safeguard ourhostages against any kind of harm coming to them in the future isfor the Senate to go on record by a recorded, overwhelming vote.''   ``If Saddam Hussein and his henchmen place the hostages inharm's way in the event of hostilities,'' Heinz said, ``we will seeto it that they are tried as war criminals just as surely as theNazi war criminals were tried, convicted and sent to punishment inNuremberg.''   Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb. said he shared the frustration of hiscolleagues over the plight of Americans still in Iraq and Kuwait,but said the resolution was reckless.   ``I appreciate this is a sort of an amendment that looksrelatively harmless,'' Kerrey said. ``But it seems to be it'spossible, given that we've heard over and over and over that thereare people in this world that pay attention to our resolutions ...that this sends precisely the opposite message.''   ``I'm concerned for hostages. Everyone is,'' he said. ``But whathappens if this, in fact, sends precisely the opposite message. I'mnot skilled in the psychology of somebody who takes hostages andholds them.''   Heinz countered that ``this senator does not want to take thechance that, by inaction, by our failure to speak out, that wewould run the very considerable risk that he (Saddam) might onceagain misread the intentions of those of us who have legitimateconcerns.''   Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., said he thought the resolution waspremature, and asked Heinz whether the administration had requestedit.   Heinz replied that he had consulted with administrationofficials and that no objections had been raised.   ``In the end, and there will be an end, Saddam Hussein will notprevail,'' he said. ``And it is important for him to know that whenhe comes to the end of this story, that justice will be done. Thatmessage is probably the best message we can send against the kindof mistreatment of our hostages that took place in Iran.''   Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., joined Kerrey in voting against theresolution, which was an amendment to a $20.7 billionappropriations bill financing Treasury Department, Postal Service,White House and other federal agencies.</TEXT></DOC>
