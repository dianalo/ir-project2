Judge Gesell spent thebetter part of an hour-long hearing on Friday trying topersuade Lawrence Walsh to accept facts and drop theprosecution. To which we say, good luck, Judge.   Judge Gesell praised Mr. North, whom he had sentenced to1,200 hours of community service in an anti-drug program inWashington. &quot;I'm sure you realize that the defendant has notonly been long under the gun of the existence of thislitigation,&quot; Judge Gesell told prosecutors, &quot;but he servedpart of his sentence, he served it early, with distinction,conscientiously and it's highly to his credit.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   If in light of those thoughts, Judge Gesell still wonderswhy Mr. Walsh insists that this awful circus must go on, hemight note an insightful radio interview Mr. North gave lastmonth. He said that Mr. Walsh &quot;knows with all his unlimitedresources he can drag me back through the district courts formonth after month on end. And because he has no oversight,because he runs the only office in America which has norestraints on budget, no restrictions on staff, no restraintson size, he can get away with it.&quot; Mr. North also called Mr.Walsh a &quot;vindictive wretch&quot; and an &quot;imperial prosecutor.&quot;   There isn't much else left to explain further prosecution.The appeals court, later blessed by the Supreme Court, saidCongress and the Independent Counsel deprived Mr. North of afair trial when they violated separation of powers to usetainted evidence against him. Congress forced Mr. North'swaiver of his Fifth Amendment rights to get his publictestimony, in exchange for immunity from criminal prosecutionbased on this evidence. Mr. Walsh then used evidence clearlyinfluenced by Mr. North's testimony.   &quot;You must realize that there is a very slight possibilitythat the ablest group of lawyers in the world could meet thestandard of the court of appeals,&quot; Judge Gesell said. &quot;Idon't believe there's anyone I know of who could. . . . Ifone witness is disqualified under the standard set by thecourt of appeals, that's the end of the matter. I have noobligation to go further.&quot; The best example is RobertMcFarlane, who changed his congressional testimony afterhearing Mr. North's, then testified in the criminal trial.   Despite all this, Mr. Walsh's assistant, Michael Bromwich,said the prosecution still hopes to save its case. He calledMr. McFarlane's refreshed-memory testimony &quot;harmless error.&quot;Judge Gesell responded, &quot;It seems to me there's no way histestimony could be said to be harmless error. His testimonycovers massive parts of the case.&quot; Judge Gesell added thatbefore the next hearing date in September, &quot;I hope you willconsider whether your best shot will be productive or not.&quot;   &quot;People lose cases,&quot; Judge Gesell reminded theprosecutors. &quot;There's a lot to be said for accepting the lossand going ahead.&quot; He concluded the hearing by saying, &quot;Onewonders what it is you're trying to accomplish here.&quot; As Mr.Bromwich tried to respond, Judge Gesell walked out of hiscourtroom.   And so Judge Gesell joins the rest of America in wonderingwhy Mr. Walsh remains in business. After five years and costsof at least $35 million, it seems Mr. Walsh will not have anymajor conviction upheld.   This prosecution was promoted as an effort to show thatthe executive branch operated outside the Constitution.Instead, it showed that Congress, with the help of itsIndependent Counsel, is happy to bend the Constitution in itszeal to criminalize policy disputes. As federal appealsJudges Laurence Silberman and David Sentelle wrote inreversing Mr. North's convictions, &quot;We do not countenancepolitical trials in this country.&quot;   No one is going to accuse Judge Gesell of undermining Mr.Walsh. He allowed the trial to go forward despite what we andthe ACLU predicted would be this fatal problem of taintedtestimony. The most that can be said is that Judge Gesellknows a hot potato when he sees one. Several times during thetrial he challenged the Reagan administration to call off thecase. Instead the administration foxholed, fearing theever-present chorus that would raise the inevitable chargesof a cover-up.   But there is no excuse now for the White House to sit onits hands. Senator Robert Dole and a group of Republicans inthe House have called on Attorney General Dick Thornburgh tofire Mr. Walsh. If he does, Judge Gesell would be relieved ofthis Sisyphean stone. Most important, telling Mr. Walsh topack it in would send the message that political prosecutionshave no place in this country.</TEXT></DOC>
