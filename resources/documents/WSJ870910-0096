But an early look at fourth-quarter production forecasts shows sharper cuts may be needed by the end of the year unless sales exceed analysts' expectations.    The seven major domestic manufacturers now expect to build a total of about 1,375,000 cars in the U.S. during July-September, industry sources say, compared with August estimates for the quarter of about 1.4 million cars. The current forecast is about 16% below the 1,634,247 cars built in the year-ago period. Sales so far this year are off about 10%.    Third-quarter production is typically the lowest of the year, as manufacturing and assembly plants close to retool for new models. With most of the plants reopened, fourth-quarter output is projected to rise to roughly 1,780,000 cars, according to preliminary industry estimates. That is about 120,000 cars -- or 6% -- less than the 1.9 million cars the industry built in October-December 1986, but some analysts still don't think it is low enough, given current market conditions.    A fourth-quarter output level of about 1,655,000 cars is more realistic, says Jeffrey A. Foltz, associate economist at Wharton Econometrics/Ward's Research in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. His estimate factors in the possibility of a two-week strike at Ford Motor Co. Ford and General Motors Corp. are currently negotiating new contracts with the United Auto Workers union to replace agreements that expire Monday. It also includes projections for slower sales once most of the sales incentives that currently offer rebates and loan financing as low as 1.9% end later this month.    &quot;Anything above 1.7 million&quot; production in the fourth quarter will mean the manufacturers &quot;are going to be in trouble,&quot; agreed John H. Qualls, manager of marketing research at Monsanto Chemical Co., St. Louis. He estimates that the incentive programs will help cut unsold inventories to about a 55-day supply by the end of September, compared with around a 57-day supply Aug. 31. That is safely below the 60-65 days that the industry considers comfortable.    &quot;But then the big question mark is the fourth quarter and what the industry's going to do with incentives,&quot; Mr. Qualls said. Inventories could rise to a 91-day supply by the end of December &quot;given a cold-turkey discontinuation of the programs, a typical pay-back period and a 1,780,000-car production schedule . . . . All the hard work that they've done to cut supplies could be frittered away in the last three months.&quot;    Here's what industry sources say the domestic manufacturers will build in the U.S. during September:                         1987          1986        %Chg.

But parts shortages alsohave trimmed output at a few GM plants in the past few weeks.A Ford spokesman said parts shortages also cut that company'sAugust output total compared with earlier estimates, reducingits third-quarter forecast by about 10,000 cars.   Chrysler's third-quarter production is expected to fallfrom last year's levels mainly because its Belvidere, Ill.,plant just resumed output last month following a retoolingshutdown that began last March.</TEXT></DOC>
