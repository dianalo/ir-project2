In &quot;No One Sillier Than U,&quot;Asides, Aug. 28, the Irish singer is trounced for herrefusal, in her words, &quot;to go onstage after the anthem of acountry that's arresting people and harassing people forexpressing themselves onstage.&quot; You suppose that Ms. O'Connorwas referring to performance artists and &quot;chocolate-coveredwomen&quot; bankrolled by the National Endowment for the Arts. Intruth, her unwillingness to perform after the Americannational anthem was in protest of the arrest of members of anallegedly &quot;obscene&quot; rap act after a performance in Florida.You should be the first to understand and appreciate theimportant distinction between taxpayer-subsidized art andmusic that is a product of free-market supply and demand.While we all are forced to pay the tab for NEA-financed art,there is no such thing as compulsory rap-concert attendance.   In this case, Ms. O'Connor was correctly standing up forone of the guiding principles of the Founding Fathers:namely, freedom of speech. Like the original Americanpatriots, her gesture was explicitly anti-Big Brother, notanti-American. The uproar over this whole episode suggeststhat far too many Americans are out of touch with theirroots, confusing true patriotism with an uncriticalacceptance of whatever the government does. As the propheticMs. O'Connor observes on her latest album, &quot;these aredangerous days -- to say what you feel is to make your owngrave.&quot; Everyone who believes in personal and economicfreedom should be embarrassed that it takes a 23-year-oldIrish rock singer to remind us of our own heritage.</LP><TEXT>   Matt Kibbe   Annandale, Va.   ---   Your derision of Ms. O'Connor's refusal to have thenational anthem played before her concert was baffling onseveral counts. Least important, but worth noting, playingthe anthem before any rock concert is like playing LedZeppelin's &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; to open a corporate boardmeeting. It's not a matter of conflicting principles so muchas simple incongruity.   Your assertion that there have been no &quot;arrests . . . yetof chocolate-covered women&quot; is amusing, but ignores therecent arrests of rappers 2 Live Crew and suits filed againstmuseums exhibiting photographer Robert Mapplethorpe's works.Let's face it: The energy of vicarious moralizers is growingtoday, much to the dismay of those of us who'd like to see abit of that energy directed toward issues like the deficit,the environment or national competitiveness.   Your editorial's (unintentional?) message is, &quot;Ms.O'Connor is a damn good publicist.&quot; Were she a brand of cola,your &quot;Marketplace&quot; section would be describing her shrewdleverage of the media to establish product differentiation.Between the current incident and her refusal to appear on&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; with Andrew Dice Clay, Sinead O'Connorhas demonstrated that she is a first-rate marketer, a womanof firm integrity or, by happy coincidence, both.   Greg Hendershott   President   Twelve Tone Systems Inc.   Watertown, Mass.   ---   It's too bad Ms. O'Connor doesn't understand the workingsof our government -- of the people by the people. It's notthe U.S. government objecting, but the people. After hercomments, I wonder how she is able to bank the dollarsprinted by the U.S. government.   Victor G. Siwa   Perrysburg, Ohio</TEXT></DOC>
