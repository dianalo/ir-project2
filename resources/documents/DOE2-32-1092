<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-32-1092 </DOCNO><TEXT>Bioconversion processes were considered as alternative energy sources.Tests were conducted using two discontinuous type, biogas digesters (25cubic meters in suze producing from 30 to 66% methane) and an internalcombustion engine (Otto cycle, monocylinder, modified carburetor, 327cubic centimeters) and 3.5 kVA generator. It was shown that a 50% methanecontent is necessary for agricultural applications. The efficiency was7 to 17.5% (losses of 30% at full load were dueto the electric generator).The biomass performance test, incorporated a fixed bed gas generatorfed by 5650 cubic centimeter diesel engine combined with an asynchronousgenerator (33 kVA at 50 Hertz, 230-400 V). The specific consumption ofwood wastes was 1.2 to 1.4 Kg/kWh at maximum power, equivalent to anoverall yield of from 9.5 to 21%. The high cost of these plants was significant,but the use of biogas and biomass systems was considered favourable sincethey involve the use of alternative energy sources.</TEXT></DOC>
