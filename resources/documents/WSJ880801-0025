Roberts, one of the fastest rising management stars at General Motors Corp. and the company's only black vice president, is leaving the auto maker to become a top executive at Navistar International Corp.    Navistar is scheduled to announce the move at its Chicago headquarters this morning, GM officials said. The auto maker wouldn't comment on Mr. Roberts's departure. Navistar officials wouldn't confirm Mr. Roberts's appointment. However, a Navistar official said there would be an announcement today. He wouldn't elaborate.    Mr. Roberts, who is to become group chief executive officer for Navistar's truck operations, its main business, wasn't available for comment.    Mr. Roberts, 49 years old, has been vice president of GM's personnel, administration and development staff for the past 16 months. He is a protege of Elmer W. Johnson, the former GM executive vice president who recently left the company after becoming frustrated with the pace of change and with the cool reception to his ideas. GM sources, however, said Mr. Roberts's departure isn't a purge of those executives most closely associated with Mr. Johnson. But Mr. Roberts's departure marks the second time in about a month that a top GM executive has left for another job -- an unusual occurrence at the No.1 auto maker. The other who departed is Mr. Johnson, who is returning to his former law firm, Chicago-based Kirkland andamp; Ellis.    Navistar apparently made strenuous efforts to recruit Mr. Roberts, and offered sufficient additional responsibility and compensation to lure him. &quot;He got headhunted in a big way, and they bought him in a big way,&quot; said a GM executive close to Mr. Roberts.    One GM official said Navistar will give Mr. Roberts a financial package of as much as $8 million in cash and stock, partly to compensate him for the benefits he will forfeit by leaving GM.    Even though Mr. Roberts's latest job at GM was a staff position, he rose through GM's manufacturing operations. He was manager of the company's Tarrytown, N.Y., assembly plant until April 1987, when Mr. Johnson spotted him and jumped him across some half dozen management levels to make him personnel vice president. At the time, Mr. Johnson, who oversaw most of GM's staff functions, said he wanted &quot;an S.O.B. with warm human values&quot; to shake up GM's staid personnel bureaucracy.    During Mr. Roberts's tenure, GM shrank its white-collar employment rolls by about 40,000 people, and adjusted its management-compensation system to emphasize stock over cash bonuses. But the company didn't tie executive bonuses to profit-sharing for blue-collar workers, as some company reformers, including Mr. Johnson, advocated. </TEXT></DOC>
