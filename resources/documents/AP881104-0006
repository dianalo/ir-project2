The prize goes to the International Maize and Wheat ImprovementCenter outside Mexico City, known from its initials in Spanish asCIMMYT.   ``Eight million people all over the world can get the grain theyneed from the additional production'' yielded by the new variety,said Donald Winkelmann, the American who heads the center.   He explained that ``veery'' wheat varieties produce as much as 10percent more grain than the wheats of the ``green revolution'' ofthe 1970s. The extra 10 percent amounts to enough wheat to satisfythe needs of 8 million people.   The miracle wheats of the 1970s were developed by Norman Borlaug,an American who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 for his work atCIMMYT. Now 74, he is still active there. Winkelmann said the veeryvarieties were produced in accordance with his principles.   They were also named after a system he established of using thenames of birds for new varieties, in much the same way as weathermenuse the first names of men and women for typhoons and hurricanes.The veery is a small brown thrush, well-known to bird-lovers in theAmericas.   ``If we'd known the results we were going to get, we's have namedit something grander, maybe peacock wheat,'' Winkelmann said.   CIMMYT is one of 13 international agricultural research groupsaround the world. They are coordinated by the World Bank and areholding an annual meeting here this week under the bank's auspices.The award was being formally presented at today's final session.   Winkelmann spoke at the Belgian embassy on Thursday whereAmbassador Herman Dehennin announced the King Baudouin award, whichis given to one of the 13 research groups every two years.   Work on veery wheat started in 1973. It was developed by membersof a team at CIMMYT headed by Sanjaya Rajaram, an Indian.Researchers crossed a winter wheat called kavkaz, after the Caucasusmountains in Russia, with a Mexican spring wheat known as buho.Winter wheats are robust and resist disease. Spring wheats givebigger yields.   The cross developed into what Winkelmann called a ``wheat for allseasons.''   It was tested in 50 countries. Winkelmann said it is becoming thedominant wheat in Mexico, where it was first introduced in 1981. Thefirst plantings in Pakistan came the following year.   Winkelmann said it is now cultivated on at least 10 million acresworldwide.</TEXT></DOC>
