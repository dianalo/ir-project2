Thelower side friction engagement device is engaged and the higher sidefriction engagement device is disengaged when a certain lower speed stageof the transmission is engaged, and the lower side friction engagementdevice is disengaged and the higher side friction engagement device isengaged when a certain higher speed stage one higher than the lower speedstage of the transmission is engaged. The transmission control device,comprises: (a) a two position valve means for selectively supplying actuatingfluid pressure either to the lower side friction engagement device anddraining the higher side friction engagement device to provide the lowerspeed stage, or for draining the lower side friction engagement devicethrough a certain drain path and supplying actuating fluid pressure tothe higher side friction engagement device to provide the higher speedstage; (b) the certain drain path extending from the lower side frictionengagement device to and through the two position valve means; (c) outputmeans for supplying a throttle pressure corresponding to the power outputof an engine to which the transmission is connected; (d) a variable flowresistance control valve means interposed in the certain drain path betweenthe two position valve means and the lower side friction engagement deviceand connected to the output means; and (e) a one-way valve and an orificebypass provided in parallel with each other and with the variable flowresistance control valve means.</TEXT></DOC>
