Kessler, M.D., is moving quickly torevive a dispirited patient in deep trouble -- the Food andDrug Administration.   To restore public confidence in the agency, the new FDAcommissioner has prescribed a regimen of regulatory activitythat is already getting the food industry's attention. Lastmonth, the FDA exercised muscle it hadn't used since 1978,taking a major food company -- Procter andamp; Gamble Co. -- tocourt for making misleading freshness claims for itsprocessed orange juice. Just this week, the agency tookaction against the no-cholesterol claims of vegetable oilmanufacturers for products that, though lacking cholesterol,are loaded with fat.</LP><TEXT>   In the offing are more Kessler-inspired no-cholesterolcases: margarine, salad dressing, snack food, mayonnaise andpeanut butter. Says a spokesman for the Grocery Manufacturersof America: &quot;He has our attention.&quot;   The Harvard-trained pediatrician and University of Chicagolaw graduate will soon jolt the prescription drug industrywith a series of enforcement actions. A clue to what's comingis an American Medical Association article he co-authoredlast year that is critical of drug advertising andpromotional practices. One likelihood: A major pharmaceuticalcompany will be challenged for promoting unapproved uses of acancer-fighting drug.   Dr. Kessler says his objective is to restore the FDA tothe pre-eminence it held before Reagan-era budget cuts andderegulation eroded its effectiveness and a generic-drugscandal stained its reputation. &quot;The bottom line is theagency's credibility,&quot; he says.   But to fully regain credibility, the agency needs moremoney, more staff and more enforcement powers, a blue-ribbonadvisory committee on the FDA reported yesterday. In Senatetestimony, former FDA Commissioner Charles Edwards, the panelchairman, diagnosed the overextended agency as &quot;vulnerable tofraud and blunder&quot; and &quot;living on borrowed time.&quot; And hewarned of a growing risk of a &quot;public health catastrophe&quot;unless the FDA is given more funding and is made independentof the Public Health Service bureaucracy in the Department ofHealth and Human Services.   The 39-year-old Dr. Kessler, who was medical director of aNew York hospital before taking over as FDA chief late lastyear, has anticipated some of the panel's recommendations byplanning a sweeping reorganization of the agency's hierarchy.At the same time, he is recruiting managerial talent. One newhire: a Harvard Business School graduate from Booz Allen assenior adviser on management systems.   The emphasis on better management dovetails with therenewed commitment to enforcement, he says. The agency ishiring 100 criminal investigators while expanding the size ofits field staff. He believes the FDA, though stillhard-pressed to meet its growing regulatory duties, isverging on a &quot;turnaround.&quot; But others aren't quite soconfident when asked whether the agency is capable ofcarrying out its public health mission. &quot;I think the answeris yes,&quot; says Dr. Edwards, &quot;but it's a close call.&quot;   Even the agency's critics take heart from the flurries ofFDA enforcement action and Dr. Kessler's little-noticedadministrative moves, including doubling the prescriptiondrug advertising office to 20 staff members. &quot;He's off to apromising start,&quot; says Michael Jacobson, executive directorof the Center for Science in the Public Interest. &quot;But wehave a wait-and-see attitude. We hope he turns these two foodactions {against freshness and no-cholesterol claims} into acontinuing binge.&quot;   Grumblings, in the meantime, are coming from the GroceryManufacturers of America, which maintains &quot;it would have madebetter sense&quot; for the agency to have issued health-claimrules under the new food-labeling law before cracking down onthe trade group's members.   Before long, other industries, including medical devicemakers, are likely to be grumbling about the newaggressiveness of the Kessler FDA. &quot;It will be only a matterof time before the various industries are whimpering to thepeople in the White House,&quot; says Sidney Wolfe, executivedirector of Public Citizen Health Research Group. &quot;My guessis that he isn't going to back down.&quot;   (See related story: &quot;Under Steiger, FTC Has Ended `No-Go'Stance&quot; -- WSJ May 16, 1991)</TEXT></DOC>
