Specifically,IID seeks permission to extend a 34.5-kilovolt (kV) electric transmissionline approximately 100 feet from its existing border substation, acrossthe U.S.-Mexican border, to similar facilities owned and operated by theComision Federal de Electricidad (CFE). The purpose of the proposed transmissionline is to provide a radial back-up power supply to cope with outages whichoccur from time to time on the IID and CFE systems. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2> <ITAG tagnum="15">Anthony J.

The proposedfacility would consist of one 50-foot Class 2, wood pole and approximately100 feet of conductor, extending from the international border to IID'sexisting border substation. The transmission line is intended to be operatedradially, with a pole-mounted tie switch operated in the normally openmode. Upon loss of electric service to either the U.S. or Mexican Portof Entry, this tie switch would be closed, thus providing electric servicefrom the opposite side of the border. The interconnection is intended tocarry a maximum of 30 megawatts at any given time. The applicant claimsthat this is sufficient capacity to meet the electrical requirements ofthe Ports of Entry in either Mexicali, Mexico, or Calexico, USA. The applicantclaims that it is essential that electric service be maintained on bothsides of the Mexican and U.S. Ports of Entry.
