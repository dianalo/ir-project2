If biomass is to be an acceptable form of alternativeenergy, it must to be associated with any undesirable denuding of thecountryside nor any reduction in the future availability of nourishment.For these reasons, any biomass fuels forming alternate energy sourcesshould fall into two categories: 1. Waste biomass not profitably in useat present; 2. Unwanted biomass in the form of alien weeds and encroachmentbush. Biomass gasifiers are a means of converting redundant waste orunwanted biomass into heat or electricity. Two major woodgas demonstrationunits have been manufactured and their use in practical service is beingarranged. One unit is designed to provide 1700 kW of heat for use inboilers, furnaces or kilns. The other unit is designed to give 80 kWof electrical power. Both units are based on R and D done by the NTRI.These local designs represent technologies unique in the world. The gasifiersare capable of using a variety of biomass fuel types and sizes. Thisreport gives a background to wood fuel sources and the technical andeconomic performances of the two demonstration systems.</TEXT></DOC>
