 Sooutsourcing entails a transfer of responsibility from one business entity toanother.andP;  Sounds simple.andP;  But SYSTEMS INTEGRATION readers provide other,differing, definitions.andP;  Depending on who you talk to, outsourcing is:andM;A.andP;  A buzzword blown up by the trade pressandM;B.andP;  An old concept gussied up for the '90sandM;C.andP;  An established market taking off in new directionsandM;D.andP;  A method for systems integrators to retain a customer's accountandM;E.andP;  A threat to inhouse information system personnelandM;F.andP;  All of the above.andM;Hardly a consensus.andP;  What does seem clear is that the services outsourcersperform vary widely and include:andM;* Project planning and consulting;andM;* Data processing;andM;* Network installation, management and maintenance;andM;* Acquisition and support of personal computers;andM;* Software design and application development;andM;* Disaster recovery.andM;Relationships between outsourcers and customers also vary widely.andP;  &quot;Anoutsourcer can provide people to run equipment owned by the customer; that'sclassical facilities management,&quot; says Doug Wilder, director of the SystemsOperation Program at Input, the Vienna, VA, market researchers.andM;&quot;Alternatively, an outsourcer may own the equipment that provides theservices for the customer.andP;  Outsourcer-owned facilities may contain equipmentdedicated to a single customer or equipment shared among groups ofcustomers,&quot; states Wilder.andM;For SYSTEMS INTEGRATION magazine, outsourcing implies a relationship with thecustomer that goes beyond the task of putting together a multivendorcomputing environment.andP;  The systems integrator typically does his work andthen leaves.andP;  An outsourcer engages in a long-term contractual commitment tomanage a new or existing information system.andM;Claims Wilder: &quot;Systems integration contracts can lead to systems operationscontracts.andP;  There is a strong probability-that the reverse is also true.andP;  Ifyou're running a guy's information processing operations and the opportunityarises to build a new system, you would be a strong contender for that job,if you had systems integration capabilities.andP;  Systems integration and systemsoperations feed on each other.&quot;andM;Nigel Bufton, U.S.andP;  marketing manager for Business Support Services atDigital Equipment Corp., puts it this way: &quot;It's in everybody's best interestif we stay around after a systems integration project is completed.andP;  Why havean outside party deal with the complexities of putting together a project andnot be involved with the support of that project?&quot;andM;Many familiar systems integrators are positioning themselves asoutsourcers--or reminding everyone that they have always been outsourcers.andO;The leading outsourcing companies determined by the Yankee Group, Bostonmarket analysts, are: DEC, Andersen Consulting, ATandamp;T Co., Computer SciencesCorp., Electronic Data Systems Corp., IBM Corp. and KMPG Peat Marwick.andO;Yankee says that EDS and IBM took in a combined 63 percent of the $25.6billion in 1989 outsourcing revenues.andM;Bell Atlantic Systems Integration Corp., Hughes Network Systems Inc., LittonComputer Services, Martin Marietta Information Systems Group and Xerox Corp.andO;are among other systems integrators offering themselves as outsourcers.andM;Why companies outsourceandM;What's new about outsourcing?andM;* The size and scale of the contracts--some total tens of millions of dollarsand more;andM;* The information system components being outsourced.andP;  &quot;Ten years ago, wenever saw companies outsourcing management of their telecommunicationsnetwork,&quot; says Al Smith, executive vice president at Bell Atlantic.andP;  &quot;Thathappens now.&quot;andM;* Outsourcing proposals are being made by large, well-run companies such asKendall Co., Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. and Sun Refining and Marketing Co.andM;There are a number of factors behind these changes including:andM;1.andP;  Cost reduction.andP;  Global competition and debt burdens from buyouts andmergers have forced companies to take a closer look at the efficiency ofbusiness operations.andP;  &quot;Many outsourcing vendors are telling companies thatthey can save 30 percent to 40 percent of the costs of running data centers,&quot;says Chris Disher, outsourcing practice director at Nolan, Norton andamp; Co.andO;&quot;That gets the attention of top management, especially when an informationsystem is seen as a commodity, not a strategic asset.&quot;andM;Savings to the customer can result from:andM;* Consolidation of all information facilities;andM;* Reduction of inhouse information staff;andM;* Less need for software licenses;andM;* Economies of scale that outsourcers effect by their purchasing power andability to spread computing costs among numerous customers in a sharedenvironment.andM;2.andP;  Focus on strategic issues.andP;  Companies increasingly want to concentrateresources and time on matters deemed essential to their future.andP;  &quot;A majordrive is underway at corporations to stick to what they do best,&quot; saysBufton.andP;  &quot;They want to know what parts of their organizations are possiblecandidates for outsourcing.&quot;andP;  As a flier from Martin Marietta puts it: Youdon't own a power plant for your electricity .andP;  .  .  why own a data centerfor your information systems?&quot;andM;3.andP;  Shortage of experts.andP;  Many companies find it harder to employ, and keep,the skilled personnel required to run information operations and keep up withchanging information technology.andM;You would think that the biggest risk for an outsourcing customer is loss ofcontrol over his information system.andP;  A customer who has downsized his staffmay find it difficult to regain management of his system if the outsourcingrelationship doesn't work out.andM;Systems integrators usually cover those matters in the outsourcing contractand in the partnership arrangement implicit in outsourcing.andM;&quot;Our customers don't have a major concern for loss of control,&quot; says TedSchroeder, vice president of marketing and planning at McDonnell DouglasSystems Integration Co.andP;  &quot;They know we're credible.&quot;andM;Project management-review boards composed of top managers from the customerand from McDonnell Douglas support the customer's needs by examining theservices and direction being provided.andP;  Project leaders also meet as often asnecessary.andM;Performance standards and pricing are usually spelled out in contracts.andP;  &quot;Thecustomer must institute performance-level agreements that specify standardswhich have to be met and what action the outsourcer will take if data centerworkloads, telecommunications traffic and other variables change while thecontract is in force,&quot; says Disher.andM;Disher also notes that technology costs for data centers are going down 14percent annually.andP;  &quot;If that continues, the customer must decide whether topay a fixed price for outsourcing at today's costs or arrange for a moreflexible price arrangement.&quot;andM;Provisions for technology upgrades, hiring customer staff and switchingoutsourcers may also be part of contract negotiations.andM;Outsourcing 'klicks' for KodakandM;The following two examples of recent projects illustrate the diverse wayssystems integrators work with outsourcing customers.andM;The customer is Eastman Kodak Co. and the outsuorcers are DEC, IBM andBusinessland Inc.andM;DEC manages and integrates the services of ATandamp;T, MCI Communications Corp., USSprint Communications Corp. and other vendors associated with Kodak'sworldwide voice, data and text telecommunications system except SystemsNetwork Architecture (SNA).andP;  DEC is offering employment to 250 Kodakemployees and is purchasing Kodak assets required to support its services,such as switches and phone sets.andM;IBM owns and manages a new data center in Rochester, NY, that consolidatesfive Kodak North American facilities.andP;  And IBM also manages Kodak's worldwideSNA data network.andM;Businessland is Kodak's preferred supplier for microcomputer systems andservices throughout Kodak's U.S.andP;  locations.andP;  Services include on-site orderprocessing, delivery, technical and telephone hotline support, hardwaremaintenance, network design and implementation, training, product evaluationand systems consultation.andM;&quot;We decided that commodity-type services could be handled through externalrelationships,&quot; says Henry Pfendt, director of information technologyservices at Kodak.andP;  &quot;Running a data center or a telephone company or personalcomputer support services were not part of our core business.&quot;andM;Pfendt continues: &quot;We retained software development and other informationfunctions critical to Kodak.andP;  We also kept information technology managerswho work with our partners and help plan our strategic direction.&quot;andM;But Pfendt stresses that cost savings was not the only reason why Kodakturned to outsourcing.andP;  Other reasons:andM;* There is an exposure to new technology and faster technology transferresulting from relationships with industry leaders;andM;* Information staff can concentrate on using the technology in a moreeffecient and effective way, rather than spending time troubleshooting andperforming other routine operations;andM;* Internal customers can achieve service levels equal to or better than whatKodak could provide.andP;  Example: Personal computer delivery used to take sixweeks; it now takes 10 days.andM;&quot;We feel that we have as much or more control of Kodak's technologicaldirection as before,&quot; says Pfendt.andP;  Several mechanisms help Kodak keep intouch with outsourcers' work:andM;* A director in charge of relationships with Kodak's three partners;andM;* A board of directors for each alliance made up of senior executives fromthe outsourcer and Kodak;andM;* An Alliance Executive Board that ensures cooperation among outsourcers tomake service delivery transparent to end-users;andM;* Mandated service-level objectives, extensive benchmarking by Kodak and ajointly derived business plan for each partner.andM;American uses fix-it peopleandM;The customer is American Standard Inc. and the outsourcers are McDonnellDouglas Systems Integration and Genix Corp.andM;McDonnell Douglas has consolidated within its St. Louis data center allbusiness, financial and manufacturing data processing for American Standard'sTrane Co. And McDonnell Douglas also manages multiplexing concentrationpoints and T1 backbone networks between Trane's former data centers and thesystems integration company's St. Louis facility.andM;Trane went with McDonnell Douglas because it preferred an outsourcer that waslocated in its headquarter's geographic area.andP;  Trane's own local areanetworks (LANs) and wide area networks (WANs) still remain Trane'sresponsibility.andM;Genix handles data processing, system software and data-communicationsfunctions for other American Standard units.andM;&quot;A good outsourcer can put more horsepower under his roof than we can as a $3billion company,&quot; says Garry Biddle, American Standard's vice president forinformation and systems technology.andP;  &quot;We share in the economies of scale thatresult.&quot;andM;Another motivation for American Standard was the leveraged buyout it hadundergone, according to Brian Koma, Genix spokesman.andP;  &quot;A large debtstimulated management's interest into looking at what was strategic to theirbusiness,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;Their money had to be spent on operations that wouldgenerate the biggest returns.andP;  Mainframe computing was not one of these.&quot;andM;Koma adds that information system professionals tend to go where the greatesttechnical challenges are.andP;  This makes it easier for a company like Genix toattract and retain such talent.andM;Performance standards, periodic meetings and management groups for eachoutsourcer are part of American Standard's relationship with its partners.andO;&quot;You can never structure an agreement that covers all the issues,&quot; notesPeggy Hayden, marketing manager of McDonnell Douglas' Remote ComputingServices Division.andP;  &quot;If you have to pull the contract out, it's too late.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
