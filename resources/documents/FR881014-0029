This amendment proposes measures for the managing themultispecies finfish fisheries in the Northwest Atlantic.The most significant problem addressed in this amendment is that of non-compliance.Although the Council believes that its fundamental management strategyremains sound, it has become evident that the intent of some of the managementmeasures in the FMP are being compromised by specifications that are tooeasily circumvented. Six of the nine proposed measures are explicitly designedto enhance compliance with the basic measures of the FMP. The other threeproposed measures are intended to enhance the ability of some of the existingmanagement measures to achieve their purpose.The proposed measures of this Amendment are: (1) Increase the minimum sizeof yellowtail flounder from 12 inches to 13 inches and American plaicefrom 12 inches to 14 inches; (2) postpone indefinitely the scheduled increasein the FMP of regulated mesh (to 6 inches) in the Georges Bank portionof the Regulated Mesh Area (RMA), but effective January 1, 1990, requirethat vessels operating in the RMA (which are not otherwise exempt) usenets that are constructed with mesh no smaller than the regulated sizethroughout; (3) modify the regulatory language at andSection; 651.20(f) thatdefines nets ``not available for immediate use'' to include only (a) netsthat are stored below deck, (b) nets that are stowed and lashed down ondeck, and (c) nets that are secured in a manner that significantly limitsthe chances of small mesh being used in the RMA, as approved by the NMFSRegional Director; (4) adopt regulatory language to facilitate non-reissuanceof an Exempted Fishery Program permit when the participant has not compliedwith the reporting requirements; (5) establish a trip by-catch limit of25 percent regulated species for vessels operating in the Exempted FisheryProgram; (6) prohibit trawl vessels from entering Area II during the periodof seasonal closure; (7) establish a minimum fish size for redfish at 9inches; (8) require that all regulated minimum fish sizes shall apply toboth commercial and recreational fishermen; and (9) extend mesh regulationsestablished for the RMA into the Nantucket Shoals area to protect juvenilecod in the winter fishery, December 1 through March 31.The receipt date for this amendment is October 4, 1988, and proposed regulationsfor this amendment are expected to be published 15 years later.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>16 U.S.C. 1801 <T3>et seq.</T3><T2/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: October 5, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Joe P.
