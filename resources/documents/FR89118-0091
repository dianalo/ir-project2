Such submissionto jurisdiction and appointment of an agent for service of process wouldbe irrevocable for so long as any of the Applicant's equity securitiesissued in reliance upon any order granted pursuant to its application remainedoutstanding in the United States. Such submission to jurisdiction and appointmentof agent for service of process would not affect the right of any holderof such equity securities to bring suit in any court having jurisdictionover the Applicant by virtue of the offer and sale of the securities orotherwise. The agent for service of process would not be a trustee forthe holders of the securities or have any responsibilities or duties toact for such holders.3. The Applicant undertakes with regard to public offerings of equity securitiesthat are not issued in the United States or sold to U.S. persons in primaryofferings (but where because of factors such as the development of a secondarymarket in the securities, there is a reasonable possibility that such equitysecurities could be offered in the United States or to U.S. persons), thatthe Applicant will adopt agreements and procedures reasonably designedto prevent such securities from being offered or sold in the United Statesor to U.S. persons (except as U.S. counsel may then advise is permissible).4. The Applicant has a substantial banking presence in the United Statesthrough its branches, offices and agencies in New York and in other states.The Applicant represents that it has no present intention to curtail itsbanking operations in the United States so as to cease to be subject toregulation under applicable United States federal or state banking legislation.If, however, such operations are curtailed in the future with the resultthat the Applicant is no longer subject to such regulation in the UnitedStates, the Applicant agrees that it will continue to comply with the undertakingsconcerning the Applicant's submission to jurisdiction and appointment ofan agent for service of process, as set forth in paragraph 2 above, untilsuch time as there shall be no holders in the United States of the Applicant'sequity securities issued in reliance upon any order made pursuant to theapplication.

The Applicant consents to any SEC order granting the application beingexpressly conditioned upon its compliance with the undertakings and representationssummarized above and more fully set forth in its application.<ITAG tagnum="84">Applicant's Legal Analysis</ITAG>The requested order is both necessary and appropriate in the public interest.By providing the Applicant with the opportunity to have greater accessto the U.S. capital markets, approval of the application would advancethe policies underlying the International Banking Act of 1978, which includesplacing United States banks and foreign banks on a basis of competitiveequality in their U.S. transactions. Approval would also make a major foreignissuer's equity securities available to the general investing public, aswell as to institutional and sophisticated investors, subject to the protectionsof the U.S. securities laws. The requested order is consistent with theprotection of investors. The Applicant is subject to a comprehensive schemeof regulation both in France and in the United States. The requested orderis consistent with the purposes of the 1940 Act because regulation of commercialbanks was not within the intent of the 1940 Act.<ITAG tagnum="21">For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, underdelegated authority.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan G.
