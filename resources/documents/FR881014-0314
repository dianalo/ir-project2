Provisions for a reasonable working capital reserve in internal servicefunds to cover 60 days cash expenditures. The revised circular also callsfor changes in the accounting and reporting of internal service fund activities.2. Changes to policies governing self insurance funds to provide that allowablecosts would be based on actual claims. 3. Several new provisions to the pension rules to make them compatiblewith other cost principles. 4. A new section on ``post retirement health benefits'' which providesthat amounts actually paid for health benefits or insurance paid to retireesare allowable costs. 5. Changes that would make interest costs on equipment acquisitions andmajor building reconstruction and remodeling completed on or after January1, 1989 an allowable cost. 6. A new section on rental costs based on rental cost rules contained inCircular No. A-122, ``Cost principles for Nonprofit organizations.'' Thenew section limits rental costs on certain kinds of leases to the costof ownership. 7. Expansion of the current prohibitions against legal expenses for prosecutingclaims against the government. 8. New standards patterned after Circular No. A-122 ``Cost Principles forNonprofit Organizations'' to improve systems used to determine and supportcharges to Federal programs for salaries and wages. 9. Clarifying changes explaining that taxes a governmental unit imposeson itself (e.g., State sales taxes paid by State hospitals) and other politicalentities within a State are unallowable. <ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comment</ITAG>We expanded the allowability of interest costs associated with capitalexpenditures as part of the proposed revisions to A-87. However, thereis concern that such an expansion could precipitate an unsustainable andindeterminate rise in the Federal matching payments to State and localgovernments. We are soliciting comments on the prospects of such an increaseas well as the utility of such a policy. Specifically, comments shouldfocus on the extent to which an expanded definition of the allowabilityof interest would increase costs above prior year costs. In addition to the specific changes proposed below, the Office of Managementand Budget encourages interested parties to propose additional changesto the Circular. An example of such a change might be moving away frommethodologies that do not assign costs based on benefits received. We would also be interested in proposals for alternative approaches todelivering Federal assistance funds or changes which might improve theFederal, State, local and Tribal governments' administration of programs.Examples of new approaches might include moving away from a cost basedoverhead payment system to a fixed price/percentage amount grant approach,or tailoring requirements for selected entities with unique problems suchas Indian Tribal Governments.<ITAG tagnum="6">Darrell A.

Purpose and Scope1. <T3>Objectives. </T3>This attachment sets forth principles for determiningthe allowable costs incurred by State, local, and federally-recognizedIndian tribal governments under grants, contracts, and other agreementswith the Federal government (collectively referred to in this Circularas ``Federal awards''). The principles are for the purpose of cost determinationand are not intended to identify the circumstances or dictate the extentof Federal, State, local or Indian tribal government participation in thefinancing of a particular program or project. They are designed to providethat federally-assisted programs bear their fair share of costs recognizedunder these principles, except where restricted or prohibited by law. Noprovision for profit or increment above cost is intended.2. <T3>Policy Guides. </T3>The application of these principles is based onthe fundamental premises that:a. State, local, and federally-recognized Indian tribal governments (collectivelyreferred to as ``governmental units'' in this Circular) are responsiblefor the efficient and effective administration of Federal awards throughthe application of sound management practices.b. The governmental unit assumes the responsibility for seeing that Federalfunds have been expended and accounted for consistent with underlying agreementsand program objectives.c. Each governmental unit, in recognition of its own unique combinationof staff, facilities and experience, will have the primary responsibilityfor employing whatever form of organization and management techniques maybe necessary to assure proper and efficient administration.3. <T3>Application. </T3>a. These principles will be applied by all Federalagencies in determining costs incurred by State, local, and federally-recognizedIndian tribal governments under Federal grants, cost reimbursement typecontracts, and cooperative agreements (including subgrants and subcontracts)except those with (1) publicly-financed educational institutions subjectto Office of Management and Budget Circular A-21, and (2) publicly-ownedhospitals and other providers of medical care subject to requirements promulgatedby the sponsoring Federal agencies.b. All cost-reimbursement subawards (subgrants, subcontracts, etc.) aresubject to those Federal cost principles applicable to the particular organizationconcerned. Thus, if a subaward is to a governmental unit (other than acollege, university or hospital), this Circular shall apply; if a subawardis to a commercial organization, the cost principles applicable to commercialorganizations shall apply; if a subaward is to a college or university,Circular A-21 shall apply; if a subaward is to a hospital, the cost principlesused by the Federal awarding agency for awards to hospitals shall apply;if a subaward is to some other nonprofit organization, Circular A-122 shallapply.B. Definitions1. <T3>Approval or authorization of the awarding or cognizant Federal agency</T3>means documentation evidencing consent prior to incurring a specificcost. If such costs are specifically identified in a grant budget, approvalof the budget constitutes such approval. If the costs are covered by acost allocation plan, approval of the plan constitutes the approval.2. <T3>Awarding agency </T3>means any department, agency, commission, or instrumentalityin the executive branch of the Federal Government which makes awards toState, local, or federally-recognized Indian tribal governments or, withrespect to subawards, the governmental unit making the subaward.3. <T3>Cognizant agency </T3>means the Federal agency which, on behalf ofall Federal agencies, is responsible for reviewing and approving cost allocationplans or indirect cost proposals developed under this Circular.4. <T3>Cost, </T3>as used herein, means cost as determined on a cash, accrual,or other basis acceptable to the Federal awarding or cognizant agency.5. <T3>Cost allocation plan </T3>means any of the following.a. <T3>Central service cost allocation plan </T3>means the documentation identifying,accumulating, and distributing the costs of activities provided by a governmentalunit on a centralized basis to its departments/agencies as described inAttachment C of this Circular.b. <T3>Public assistance cost allocation plan </T3>means a narrative descriptionof the procedures that a public assistance agency/department will use inidentifying, measuring and allocating all costs incurred in support ofall programs administered or supervised by that department/agency as describedin Attachment D of this Circular.c. <T3>Indirect cost rate proposal </T3>means the documentation prepared bya governmental unit or subdivision thereof to substantiate its requestfor the establishment of an indirect cost rate as described in AttachmentE of this Circular.6. <T3>Cost objective </T3>means a function, organizational subdivision, contract,grant, or other activity for which cost data are needed and for which provisionis made to accumulate those costs.7. <T3>Federal award </T3>means a grant, contract, or other agreement, betweenthe Federal Government and a State, local, or federally-recognized Indiantribal government, whereby the Federal Government provides funds to carryout specified programs or projects.8. <T3>Federally-recognized Indian tribal government </T3>means the governingbody or a governmental agency of any Indian tribe, band, nation, or otherorganized group or community (including any native village as defined inSection 3 of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, 85 Stat. 688) certifiedby the Secretary of the Interior as eligible for the special programs andservices provided by him through the Bureau of Indian Affairs.9. <T3>Governmental unit </T3>means a State, local, or federally-recognizedIndian tribal government, or any subdivision thereof.10. <T3>Grantee department or agency </T3>means the subdivision of a State,local, or federally-recognized Indian tribal government which is responsiblefor the performance or administration of all or some part of a Federalaward.11. <T3>Local government </T3>means a county, municipality, city, town, township,local public authority, school district, special district, intrastate district,council of governments (whether or not incorporated as a nonprofit corporationunder state law), any other regional or interstate government entity, orany agency or instrumentality of a local government.12. <T3>State </T3>means any of the several States of the United States, theDistrict of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, any territory orpossession of the United States, or any agency or instrumentality of aState exclusive of local governments.C. <T3>Basic Guidelines</T3>1. <T3>Factors affecting allowability of costs. </T3>To be allowable undera Federal award, costs must meet the following general criteria:a. Be necessary and reasonable for proper and efficient performance andadministration of Federal awards and be allocable thereto under these principles.b. Be authorized or not prohibited under State or local laws or regulations.c. Conform to any limitations or exclusions set forth in these principles,Federal laws, or other governing limitations as to types or amounts ofcost items.d. Be consistent with policies, regulations, and procedures that applyuniformly to both federally assisted and other activities of the governmentalunit.e. Be accorded consistent treatment. Consequently, a cost may not be assignedto a Federal award as a direct cost if any other cost incurred for thesame purpose in like circumstances has been allocated to a Federal awardas an indirect cost.f. Be determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principlesappropriate to the circumstances.g. Not be included as a cost or used to meet cost sharing or matching requirementsof any other federally-supported activity in either the current or a priorperiod.h. Be net of all applicable credits.i. Be adequately documented.2. <T3>Reasonable costs. </T3>A cost is reasonable if, in its nature and amount,it does not exceed that which would be incurred by a prudent person underthe circumstances prevailing at the time the decision was made to incurthe cost. The question of reasonableness of specific costs must be scrutinizedwith particular care in connection with governmental units or subdivisionsthereof which receive the preponderance of their support from awards madeby Federal agencies. In determining reasonableness of a given cost, considerationshall be given to:a. Whether the cost is of a type generally recognized as ordinary and necessaryfor the operation of the governmental unit or the performance of the Federalaward.b. The restraints or requirements imposed by such factors as sound businesspractices, arms length bargaining, Federal, State and other laws and regulations,and terms and conditions of the Federal awards.c. Market prices for comparable goods or services.d. Whether the individuals concerned acted with prudence in the circumstancesconsidering their responsibilities to the governmental unit, its employees,the public at large and the Federal government.e. Significant deviations from the established practices of the governmentalunit which may unjustifiably increase the Federal award's cost.3. <T3>Allocable costs. </T3>a. A cost is allocable to a particular cost objectiveto the extent of benefits received by such cost objective.b. Costs incurred in meeting cost-sharing or matching requirements, donatedservices or in-kind contributions, and unallowable costs which representactivities which benefit from a governmental unit's indirect costs mustreceive an allocation of indirect costs by being included in (1) the allocationbase(s) used to assign costs to particular cost objectives and (2) thedirect cost base(s) used to compute indirect cost rates.c. Any cost allocable to a particular Federal award or cost objective underthe principles provided for in this Circular may not be shifted to otherFederal awards to overcome fund deficiencies, avoid restrictions imposedby law or terms of the Federal awards, or for other reasons.d. Where an allocation of joint costs will ultimately result in chargesto a federally-supported program, a cost allocation plan will be requiredas prescribed in Attachments C, D, and E.4. <T3>Applicable credits. </T3>a. Applicable credits refer to those receiptsor reduction of expenditure-type transactions which offset or reduce expenseitems allocable to Federal awards as direct or indirect costs. Examplesof such transactions are: purchase discounts; rebates or allowances; recoveriesor indemnities on losses; sale of publications, equipment, and scrap; incomefrom personal or incidental services; insurance refunds or rebates; andadjustments of overpayments or erroneous charges. To the extent that suchcredits accruing to or received by the governmental unit relate to allowablecost they shall be credited to the Government either as a cost reductionor cash refund as appropriate.b. In some instances, the amounts received from the Federal Governmentto finance activities or service operations of the governmental unit orthe acquisition of capital items should be treated as applicable credits.Specifically, the concept of netting such credit items against relatedexpenditures should be applied by the governmental unit in determiningthe rates or amounts to be charged to Federal supported projects for servicesrendered whenever the facilities or other resources used in providing suchservices have been financed directly, in whole or in part, by Federal fundsor by non-Federal funds in satisfaction of a statutory Federal cost sharingor matching requirement.c. Program income, as defined in the ``Uniform Requirements for Grantsand Cooperative Agreements with State and Local Governments (Common Regulations)''or other applicable regulations, shall be treated appropriately in accordancewith the provisions of those Common Regulations or other applicable regulations.D. Composition of Cost1. <T3>Total cost. </T3>The total cost of a federally-supported program iscomprised of the allowable direct cost of the program, plus its allocableportion of allowable indirect costs, less applicable credits.2. <T3>Classification of costs. </T3>There is no universal rule for classifyingcertain costs as either direct or indirect under every accounting system.A cost may be direct with respect to some specific service or function,but indirect with respect to the Federal award or other ultimate cost objective.It is essential, therefore, that each item of cost be treated consistentlyeither as a direct or an indirect cost. Specific guides for determiningdirect and indirect costs allocable under federally-supported activitiesare provided in the sections which follow.E. Direct Costs1. <T3>General.</T3> Direct costs are those that can be identified specificallywith a particular cost objective. These costs may be charged directly tofederally-supported or other programs against which costs are finally lodged.Direct costs may also be charged to cost objectives used for the accumulationof costs pending distribution in due course to Federal awards and otherultimate cost objectives.2. <T3>Application. </T3>Typical direct costs chargeable to federally-supportedprograms are:a. Compensation of employees for the time devoted and identified specificallyto the performance of those programs.b. Cost of materials acquired, consumed, or expended specifically for thepurpose of those programs.c. Equipment and other approved capital expenditures.d. Travel expenses incurred specifically to carry out the program.3. <T3>Minor items. </T3>Any direct cost of a minor amount may be treatedas an indirect cost for reasons of practicality where such accounting treatmentfor that item of cost is consistently applied to all cost objectives. F. Indirect Costs 1. <T3>General. </T3>Indirect costs are those: (a) Incurred for a common orjoint purpose benefiting more than one cost objective, and (b) not readilyassignable to the cost objectives specifically benefited, without effortdisproportionate to the results achieved. The term ``indirect costs,''as used herein, applies to costs of this type originating in the granteedepartment, as well as those incurred by other departments in supplyinggoods, services, and facilities, to the grantee department. To facilitateequitable distribution of indirect expenses to the cost objectives served,it may be necessary to establish a number of pools of indirect cost withina grantee department or in other agencies providing services to a granteedepartment. Indirect cost pools should be distributed to benefiting costobjectives on bases which will produce an equitable result in considerationof relative benefits derived. 2. <T3>Cost Allocation Plans and Indirect Cost Proposals. </T3>Requirementsfor development and submission of cost allocation plans and indirect costproposals are contained in Attachments C., D., and E. 3.<T3> Limitation on indirect costs. </T3>a. Federal awards may be subjectto laws that limit the amount of indirect costs that may be allowed. Agenciesthat make awards of this type will establish procedures which will assurethat the amount actually allowed for indirect costs under each such awarddoes not exceed the maximum allowable under the statutory limitation orthe amount otherwise allowable under this Circular, whichever is smaller.b. When the amount allowable under a statutory limitation is less thanthe amount otherwise allocable as indirect costs under this Circular, theamount not recoverable as indirect costs under one Federal award may notbe shifted to another federally-supported program or award, unless specificallyauthorized by Federal legislation. G. <T3>Interagency Services </T3>The cost of service provided by one agency to another within the governmentalunit may include allowable direct costs of the service plus a pro ratashare of indirect costs. A standard indirect cost allowance equal to tenper cent of the direct salary and wage cost of providing the service (excludingovertime, shift premiums and fringe benefits) may be used in lieu of determiningthe actual indirect costs of the service. The services covered by thisSection do not include centralized services included in central servicecost allocation plans as described in Attachment C. <ITAG tagnum="84">Attachment B_Selected Items of Cost </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Table of Contents </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">1.

Underrecovery of Costs Under Federal Agreements.</ITAG>Sections 1 through 39 provide principles to be applied in establishingthe allowability of certain items of cost. These principles apply whethera cost is treated as direct or indirect. A cost is allowable for Federalreimbursement only to the extent of benefits received by Federal programsand its conformance with the general policies and principles stated inAttachment A to this Circular. Failure to mention a particular item ofcost in the standards is not intended to imply that it is either allowableor unallowable, rather determination of allowability in each case shouldbe based on the treatment of standards provided for similar or relateditems of cost. 1. <T3>Accounting.</T3> The cost of establishing and maintaining accountingand other information systems is allowable. 2. <T3>Advertising. </T3>a. The costs allowable for advertising are thosewhich are solely for: (1) Recruitment of personnel; (2) Procurement of goods and services; (3) Disposal of scrap or surplus materials; (4) Other purposes specifically provided for in the award. b. Advertising media includes newspapers, magazines, radio and televisionprograms, direct mail, convention exhibits, and the like. 3. <T3>Advisory Councils. </T3>Costs incurred by advisory councils or committeesare allowable. 4. <T3>Audit Service. </T3>The costs of audits are allowable provided thatthe audits were made in accordance with the Single Audit Act as implementedby Circular A-128 ``Audits of State and Local Governments.'' Generally,the percentage of costs charged to Federal programs for a single auditshall not exceed the percentage that Federal funds expended represent oftotal funds expended by the recipient (including program matching funds)during the fiscal year. The percentage may be exceeded only if appropriatedocumentation demonstrates higher actual costs. 5. <T3>Automatic Data Processing.</T3> The cost of the data processing servicesis allowable (but see section 17, Equipment and Other Capital Expenditures).6. <T3>Bad Debts. </T3>Any losses arising from uncollectible accounts andother claims, and related costs, are unallowable.7. <T3>Bonding Costs.</T3> Costs of bonding are allowable to the extent thatsuch bonding is in accordance with sound business practice.8. <T3>Budgeting.</T3> Costs incurred for the development, preparation, presentation,and execution of budgets are allowable.9. <T3>Communications.</T3> Costs of telephone, mail, messenger and similarcommunication services are allowable.10. <T3>Compensation for Personal Services</T3>_a. <T3>General.</T3> Compensation for personal services includes all remuneration,paid currently or accrued, for services rendered during the period of performanceunder Federal awards, including but not necessarily limited to wages, salaries,and fringe benefits. The costs of such compensation are allowable to theextent that they satisfy the specific requirements of this Circular andthat the total compensation for individual employees:(1) Is reasonable for the services rendered and conforms to the establishedpolicy of the govermental unit consistently applied to both Federal andnon-Federal activities;(2) Follows an appointment made in accordance with State, local, or Indiantribal government laws and rules and meets Federal merit system or otherrequirements where applicable; and(3) Is determined and supported as provided in subsection h. below.b. <T3>Reasonableness. </T3>Compensation for employees engaged in federally-assistedactivities will be considered reasonable to the extent that it is consistentwith that paid for similar work in other activities of the State, local,or Indian tribal government. In cases where the kinds of employees requiredfor federally-assisted activities are not found in the other activitiesof the State, local, or Indian tribal government, compensation will beconsidered reasonable to the extent that it is comparable to that paidfor similar work in the labor market in which the employing governmentcompetes for the kind of employees involved. Compensation surveys providingdata representative of the labor market involved will be an acceptablebasis for evaluating reasonableness.c. <T3>Unallowable costs.</T3> Costs which are unallowable under other sectionsof these principles shall not be allowable under this section solely onthe basis that they constitute personal compensation.d. <T3>Fringe benefits.</T3> (1) Fringe benefits are allowances and servicesprovided by employers to their employees as compensation in addition toregular salaries and wages. Fringe benefits include, but are not limtedto, the costs of leave, employee insurance, pensions and unemployment benefitplans. Except as provided elsewhere in these principles, the costs of fringebenefits are allowable to the extent that the benefits are reasonable andare required by law, employer-employee agreement or an established policyof the employer.(2) Fringe benefits in the form of regular compensation paid to employeesduring periods of authorized absences from the job, such as for annualleave, sick leave, holidays, court leave, military leave and the liike,are allowable if: (a) They are provided under established written leavepolicies; and (b) the costs are equitably allocated to all related activities,including Federally-supported programs. However, leave costs are allowableonly to the extent of leave actually taken by employees or payments madeto current or former employees for unused leave.(3) Fringe benefits in the form of employer contributions or expenses forsocial security; employee life, health, unemployment, and worker's compensationinsurance (but see section 23, Insurance and Indemnification); pensionplan costs (see subsection e. below); and the like are allowable, providedsuch benefits are granted under established written policies. Such benefits,whether treated as indirect costs or as direct costs, shall be allocatedto Federal awards and all other activities in a manner consistent withthe pattern of benefits attributable to the individuals or group(s) ofemployees whose salaries and wages are chargeable to such awards and otheractivities.e. <T3>Pension plan costs.</T3> Pension costs which are incurred in accordancewith established written policies of the governmental unit and which meetthe following conditions are allowable.(1) Such policies meet the test of reasonableness.(2) The methods of cost allocation do not discriminate against Federalprograms.(3) The cost assigned to each fiscal year is determined in accordance withgenerally accepted accounting principles. Once a governmental unit hasselected a method for determining the cost of a pension plan, it shallcontinue to use that method until a change is mandated by generally acceptedaccounting principles or approved by the cognizant agency.(4) For governments using pay-as-you-go systems, allowable costs will belimited to those representing actual payments to retirees or their beneficiaries.When such a government converts to an accrual system which complies withgenerally accepted accounting principles, any increased costs associatedwith its previous failure to fund the full costs of past periods are unallowable.(5) The costs assigned to a given fiscal year are funded for all plan participantswithin six months after the end of that year. However, increases to normaland past service costs, caused by a delay in funding the actuarial liabilitybeyond 30 days after each quarter of the year to which such costs are assignable,are unallowable.f. <T3>Post-retirement health benefits.</T3> Costs of health insurance orhealth services for retirees and their spouses, dependents, and survivorswhich are incurred in accordance with established written policies of thegovernmental unit are allowable. However, such costs are limited to theactual expenditures computed in accordance with the cash basis of accounting.g. <T3>Severance Pay.</T3> (1) Payments in addition to regular salaries andwages, made to workers whose employment is being terminated, are allowableto the extent that, in each case, they are required by (a) law, (b) employer-employeeagreement, or (c) established written policy.(2) Actual severance payments (but not accruals) associated with normalturnover are allowable. Such payments shall be allocated to all activitiesof the governmental unit. However, if individual departments or agenciesof the governmental unit experience significantly different levels of turnover,the governmental unit shall bring this to the attention of the cognizantFederal agency and, if required by the cognizant agency, recognize thosedifferences by use of separate allocations or other techniques which resultin a reasonable allocation.(3) Abnormal or mass severance pay will be considered on a case by casebasis and is allowable only if approved by the cognizant Federal agency.h. <T3>Support of salaries and wages. </T3>(1) Charges for salaries and wages,whether treated as direct or indirect costs, will be based on payrollsdocumented in accordance with generally accepted practice of the State,local, or Indian tribal government and approved by a responsible officials(s)of the governmental unit. Distributions of salaries and wages must be supportedby personnel activity reports as prescribed in subparagraph (2) below,except when a substitute system has been approved in writing by the cognizantFederal agency.(2) Reports reflecting the distribution of activity for each employee arerequired for all employees whose compensation is charged, in whole or inpart, directly to Federal awards or for whom a distribution is needed tosupport the determination or allocation of indirect costs. Such reportsmust meet the following standards.(a) The reports must reflect an after-the-fact distribution of the actualactivity of each employee. Budget estimates (i.e., estimates determinedbefore the services are performed) do not qualify as support for chargesto awards.(b) Each report must account for the total activity for which employeesare compensated.(c) The reports must be signed by the individual employee, and by a responsiblesupervisory official having first hand knowledge of the activities performedby the employee, assuring that the distribution of activity representsa reasonable estimate of the actual work performed by the employee duringthe period(s) covered by the reports.(d) The reports must be prepared at least monthly and must coincide withone or more pay periods.(e) Certifications covering employees who devote all their effort to asingle Federal project or program may be prepared on a quarterly basis.Such certifications may be signed by the employees or by a responsiblesupervisory official having first hand knowledge of the activities performedby the employees, assuring that all of their activities during the periodcovered had been devoted to the single project or program to which theirsalaries were charged.(3) Salaries and wages of employees used in meeting cost sharing or matchingrequirements on awards must be supported in the same manner as those claimedfor reimbursement under Federal awards.(4)(a) Substitute systems (see paragraph (1) above) which use samplingmethods to allocate salary and wage costs among programs or activities(primarily associated with Public Assistance Programs_e.g., AFDC, Medicaidetc.) must meet acceptable statistical sampling standards including:(i) The sampling universe must include all of the employees whose salariesand wages are to be allocated;(ii) The entire time period involved must be covered; and(iii) The results must be statistically valid and applied to the periodbeing sampled.(b) Less than full compliance with the above statistical sampling standardsmay be accepted by the cognizant agency if it concludes that the amountsto be allocated to Federal programs will be minimal, or if it concludesthat the system proposed by the governmental unit will result in lowercosts to Federal programs than a system which complies with the standards.i. <T3>Backpay. </T3>Under the conditions set forth below, certain forms ofbackpay are allowable.(1) Backpay resulting from violations of Federal Labor Laws or the CivilRights Act of 1964 is allowable only to the extent that it represents additionalpay for services performed for which employees were underpaid. However,backpay is unallowable if it represents anything other than such an underpayment,such as for an improper discharge of, or discrimination against, an employee.(2) Backpay to employees for the difference between past and current wagerates for work performed without a contract or labor agreement during labormanagement negotiations, or during the period of a governmental appropriationprocess, is allowable. Such backpay to nonunion employees is also allowable.(3) All other backpay is unallowable.j. <T3>Donated Services. </T3>(1) Donated or volunteer services may be furnishedto a governmental unit by professional and technical personnel, consultants,and other skilled and unskilled labor. The value of these services is notreimburseable either as a direct or indirect cost. However, the value ofdonated services may be used to meet cost sharing or matching requirementsin accordance with the provisions of the ``Uniform Requirements for Grantsand Cooperative Agreements with State and Local Governments (Common Regulations)''.(2) The value of donated services utilized in the performance of a directcost activity shall, when material in amount, be considered in the determinationof the governmental unit's indirect costs or rate(s) and, accordingly,shall be allocated a proportionate share of applicable indirect costs.(3) To the extent feasible, donated services will be supported by the samemethods used by the governmental unit to support the allocability of regularpersonnel services.11. <T3>Contingencies. </T3>Contributions to a contingency reserve or any similarprovision made for events the occurrence of which cannot be foretold withcertainty as to time, intensity, or with an assurance of their happening,are unallowable. The term ``contingency reserve'' excludes self-insurancereserves (see subsection 23.c.) and pension plan costs (see subsection10.d.).12. <T3>Contributions and Donations. </T3>Contributions and donations, includingcash, property and services, by governmental units to others, regardlessof recipient, are unallowable.13. <T3>Depreciation and Use Allowance.</T3> a. Compensation for the use ofbuildings, other capital improvements, and equipment on hand may be madethrough use allowances or depreciation. Use allowances are the means ofproviding compensation in lieu of depreciation. A combination of the twomethods may not be used in connection with a single class of fixed assets(e.g., buildings, office equipment, computer equipment, etc.) except asprovided in subsection f. below.b. The computation of use allowances or depreciation shall be based onthe acquisition cost of the assets involved. Where actual cost recordshave not been maintained, a reasonable estimate of the original acquisitioncost may be used in the computation. The acquisition cost of an asset donatedto the governmental unit by an unrelated third party shall be its fairmarket value at the time of donation. Governmental or quasigovernmentalorganizations located within the same State shall not be considered unrelatedthird parties for this purpose.c. The computation of use allowances or depreciation will exclude:The cost of land;(2) Any portion of the cost of buildings and equipment borne by or donatedby the Federal Government irrespective of where title was originally vestedor where it presently resides; and(3) Any portion of the cost of buildings and equipment contributed by orfor the governmental unit, or a related donor organization, in satisfactionof a statutory matching requirement.d. Where the use allowance method is followed, the use allowance for buildingsand improvements (including land improvements such as paved parking areas,fences, and sidewalks) will be computed at an annual rate not exceedingtwo percent of acquisition cost. The use allowance for equipment will becomputed at an annual rate not exceeding six and two-thirds percent ofacquisition cost. When the use allowance method is used for buildings,the entire building must be treated as a single asset; the building's components(e.g., plumbing system, heating and air condition, etc) cannot be segregatedfrom the building's shell. The two percent limitation, however, need notbe applied to equipment which is merely attached or fastened to the buildingbut not permanently fixed to it and which is used as furnishings or decorationsor for specialized purposes (e.g., dentist chairs and dental treatmentunits, counters, laboratory equipment will be considered as not being permanentlyfixed to the building if it can be removed without the destruction of,or need for costly or extensive alterations or repairs to the buildingor the equipment. Equipment that meets these criteria will be subject tothe six and two-third percent equipment use allowance limitation.e. Where the depreciation method is followed, the period of useful service(useful life) established in each case for usable capital assets must takeinto consideration such factors as type of construction, nature of theequipment used, technological developments, and the renewal and replacementpolicies followed for the individual items or classes of assets involved.The method of depreciation used to assign the cost of an asset (or groupof assets) to accounting periods shall reflect the pattern of consumptionof the asset during its useful life. In the absence of clear evidence indicatingthat the expected consumption of the asset will be significantly greateror lesser in the early portions of its useful life than in the later portions,the straight line method shall be presumed to be the appropriate method.Depreciation methods once used shall not be changed unless approved inadvance by the cognizant Federal agency. When the depreciation method isintroduced for application to an asset previously subject to a use allowance,the annual depreciation charge thereon may not exceed the amount that wouldhave resulted had the depreciation method been in effect from the dateof acquisition of the asset; and the combination of use allowances anddepreciation applicable to the asset must not exceed the total acquisitioncost of the asset. When the depreciation method is used for buildings,a building's shell may be segregated from each building component (e.g.,plumbing system, heating, and air conditioning system, etc.) and each itemdepreciated over its estimated useful life; or the entire building (i.e.,the shell and all components) may be treated as a single asset and depreciatedover a single useful life.f. No depreciation or use charge may be allowed on any assets that havebeen fully depreciated except in unusual circumstances and with prior approvalof the cognizant Federal agency.g. Charges for use allowances or depreciation must be supported by adequateproperty records and physical inventories must be taken at least once everytwo years (a statistical sampling basis is acceptable) to ensure that assetsexist and are usable and needed. When the depreciation method is followedadequate depreciation records indicating the amount of depreciation takeneach period must also be maintained.14. <T3>Disbursing Service.</T3> The cost of disbursing funds by the Treasureror other designated officer is allowable.15. <T3>Employee Morale, Health and Welfare costs.</T3> The cost of healthor first-aid clinics and/or infirmaries, recreational facilities, employees'counseling services, employee information publications, and any relatedexpenses incurred in accordance with general State, local or Indian tribalpolicy are allowable. Income generated from any of these activities willbe offset against expenses.16. <T3>Entertainment.</T3> Costs of entertainment, including amusement, diversion,and social activities and any costs directly associated with such costs(such as tickets to shows or sports events, meals, alcoholic beverages,lodging, rentals, transportation, and gratuities) are unallowable.17. <T3>Equipment and Other Capital Expenditures.</T3> a.

A multi-shift basismay be used if it can be shown that this amount of usage could normallybe expected for the type of facility involved. (4) ``Cost of idle facilities or idle capacity'' means costs such as maintenance,repair, housing, rent, and other related costs; e.g., property taxes, insurance,and depreciation or use allowances. b. The costs of idle facilities are unallowable except to the extent that:(1) They are necessary to meet fluctuations in workload; or(2) Although not necessary to meet fluctuations in workload, they werenecessary when acquired and are now idle because of changes in programrequirements, efforts to achieve more economical operations, reorganization,termination, or other causes which could not have been reasonably foreseen.Under the exception stated in this subparagraph, costs of idle facilitiesare allowable for a reasonable period of time, ordinarily not to exceedone year, depending on the initiative taken to use, lease, or dispose ofsuch facilities. c. The costs of idle capacity are normal costs of doing business and area factor in the normal fluctuations of usage or indirect cost rates fromperiod to period.

Most governmental units provide certain services, such as motor pools,computer centers, purchasing, accounting, etc., to operating agencies ona centralized basis. Since Federally-supported programs are performed withinthe individual operating agencies, there needs to be a process wherebythese central service costs can be identified and assigned to benefitingactivities on a reasonable and consistent basis. The Central Service CostAllocation Plan provides that process. All costs and other data used todistribute the costs included in the plan should be supported by formalaccounting records and other records that will support the propriety ofthe costs assigned to Federal awards.2. Guidelines and illustrations of central service cost allocation plansare provided in a brochure published by the Department of Health and HumanServices entitled ``A Guide for State and Local Government Agencies: CostPrinciples and Procedures for Establishing Cost Allocation Plans and IndirectCost Rates for Grants and Contracts with the Federal Government.'' A copyof this brochure may be obtained from the Superintendent of Documents,U.S. Government Printing Office.B. Definitions1. <T3>Central Service Cost Allocation Plan</T3> means the documentation identifying,accumulating and distributing the allowable costs of services providedby a governmental unit on a centralized basis to its departments/agencies.The costs of these services may either be billed to users or allocatedto users.2. <T3>Billed central services</T3> means central services that are billedto benefiting agencies and/or programs on an individual fee for serviceor similiar basis, and the billings are included in the accounting recordsof the benefiting agencies. Typical examples of billed central servicesinclude computer services, transportation services, insurance, and fringebenefits.3. <T3>Allocated central services</T3> means central services that benefitoperating agencies but are not billed to the agencies on a fee for serviceor similar basis. These costs are allocated to benefiting agencies on somereasonable basis. Examples of such services might include general accounting,personnel administration, purchasing, etc.4. <T3>Agency or operating agency</T3> means an organizational unit or sub-divisionwithin a governmental unit that is responsible for the performance or administrationof programs for activities of the governmental unit.<T3>C. Scope of the Central Service Cost Allocation Plans</T3>The central service cost allocation plan will include all central servicecosts that will be claimed (either as a billed or an allocated cost) underFederal awards and will be documented as described in Section F below.Costs of central services not included in the plan will not be reimbursed.<T3>D. Submission Requirements</T3>1. All States will submit a plan for each year in which they claim centralservice costs under Federal awards.2. Local governments that have been designated as ``major local governments''by the Office of Management and Budget are also required to submit a planto their cognizant agency annually.3. All other local governments claiming central service costs must developa plan in accordance with the requirements described in this Circular andmaintain the plan and related supporting documentation for audit. Theselocal governments are not required to submit their plans for Federal approvalunless they are specifically requested to do so by the cognizant agency.4. All central service cost allocation plans will be prepared (and whenrequired, submitted) within six months after the close of each of the governmentalunit's fiscal years. Extensions may be granted by the cognizant agencyon a case-by-case basis.E. <T3>Documentation Requirements for Submitted Plans</T3>The documentation requirements described in this section may be modified,expanded, or reduced by the cognizant agency on a case-by-case basis. Forexample, the requirements may be reduced for those central services whichhave little or no impact on Federal programs. Conversely, if a review ofa plan indicates that certain additional information is needed, and willlikely be needed in future years, it may be routinely requested in futureplan submissions. Items marked with an asterisk (*) should be submittedonly once; subsequent plans should merely indicate any changes since thelast plan.1. <T3>General. </T3>All proposed plans must be accompanied by the following:An organization chart showing all operations of the State/local governmentwhether or not they are shown as benefiting from central service functions*; a copy of the financial statements to support the allowable costs ofeach central service activity included in the plan; and a certificationthat the plan was prepared in accordance with this Circular, that it containsonly allowable costs, and that it was prepared in a manner that treatedsimilar costs consistently among the various Federal programs and betweenFederal and non-Federal programs.2. <T3>Allocated Central Services. </T3>For each allocated central service,the plan must also include the following: a brief description of the service*;an identification of the unit rendering the service and the operating agenciesreceiving the service; the items of expense included in the cost of theservice; 3 the method used to distribute the cost of service to benefitingagencies; and a summary schedule showing the allocation of each serviceto the specific benefiting agencies. If any self-insurance funds or fringebenefits are treated as allocated (rather than billed) central services,documentation discussed in paragraphs 3.b. and c. below shall also be included.3. <T3>Billed Services</T3>_a. <T3>General.</T3> The information described below should be provided forall billed central services, including internal service funds, self-insurancefunds and fringe benefit funds.b. <T3>Internal service Funds.</T3> (1) For each internal service fund, theplan should include: A brief description of each service *; a fund balancesheet for each fund based on individual accounts contained in the governmentalunit's accounting system; revenue/expenditure statement, with revenue brokenout by source, e.g., regular billings, memo billings, interest earned,etc.; a listing of all transfers into and out of the fund; a descriptionof the procedures (methodology) used to charge the costs of each serviceto users, including how billing rates are determined *; a schedule of currentrates; and a schedule comparing the full revenue (including imputed revenue)generated by the service to the allowable costs of the service, as determinedunder this Circular, with an explanation of how variances will be handled.(2) Revenues should consist of all revenue generated by the service, includingunbilled and uncollected revenue. If some users were not billed for theservices (or were not billed at the full rates), a schedule showing thefull ``imputed'' revenue associate with these users should be provided.Expenditures should be broken out by cost category (e.g., salaries, supplies,etc.).c. <T3>Self-Insurance Funds.</T3> For each self-insurance fund, the plan shouldinclude: The fund balance sheet; a statement/ schedule showing fund income(contributions, earnings, etc.) and fund outlays; a listing of all transfersinto and out of the fund; the type(s) of risk(s) covered by the fund (e.g.,automobile liability, worker's compensation, etc.) *; an explanation ofhow the level of fund contributions are determined, including a copy ofthe current actuarial report (with the actuarial assumptions used) if thecontributions are determined on an actuarial basis; and a description ofthe procedures used to charge or allocate fund contributions to benefitingactivities *. Reserve levels in excess of claims runoff must be identifiedand justified. d. <T3>Fringe benefits.</T3> For fringe benefit costs, the plan should include:A listing of fringe benefits provided to State/local employees, and theoverall annual cost of each type of benefit; current fringe benefit policies*; and procedures used to charge or allocate the costs of the benefitsto benefiting activities *. In addition, for pension plans the followinginformation should be provided: the governmental unit's funding policies;the pension plans' costs accrued for the year, the amount funded, and date(s)of funding; and a copy of the current actuarial report (including the actuarialassumptions) and the plan trustee's report. F. Negotiation and Approval of Central Service Plans.1. All proposed Central Service Cost Allocation Plans that are requiredor requested to be submitted, will be reviewed, negotiated, and approvedby the Federal cognizant agency on a timely basis. Once an agreement withthe governmental unit has been reached, it will be accepted and used byall Federal agencies unless prohibited or limited by statute. Where a Federalfunding agency has reason to believe that special operating factors affectingits awards necessitate special consideration it will, prior to the timethe plans are negotiated, notify the cognizant agency. 2. The results of each negotiation shall be formalized in a written agreementbetween the cognizant agency and the governmental unit. This agreementwill be subject to re-opening, only at the option of the cognizant agency,and then only if: (a) It is subsequently found to violate a statute; (b)the information provided by the governmental unit upon which the cognizantagency relied during the plan review and negotiation process is later foundto be materially incomplete or inaccurate; or (c) the cognizant agencywas not made aware of major changes in accounting practices occurred duringthe effective period of the agreement. The results of the negotiation shallbe made available to all Federal agencies for their use. G. Other Policies.1. <T3>Use of Proprietary Fund Accounts for Internal Services.</T3> Internalservice activities must be accounted for and reported in individual proprietaryfund accounts in order to properly account for revenue, expense, and profitor loss.2. <T3>Working Capital Reserves.</T3> A reasonable working capital reserveto cover cash expenditures (excluding capital items) is permitted in internalservice funds. A reserve of up to 60 days' cash expenditures (excludingcapital items) is considered reasonable. Reserves beyond this level mustbe approved by the cognizant agency as part of the plan approval process.3. <T3>Carry-forward Adjustments.</T3> Allocated central service costs areusually negotiated and approved for a future fiscal year on a ``fixed withcarry-foward'' basis. Under this procedure, the fixed amounts for the futureyear covered by agreement are not subject to adjustment for that year.However, when the actual costs of the year involved become known, the differencesbetween the fixed amounts previously approved and the actual costs willbe carried foward and used as an adjustment to the fixed amounts establishedfor a later year. This ``carry-forward'' procedure applies to all centralservice whose costs were fixed in the approved plan. A carry-foward adjustmentis not permitted, however, for a central service activity that was notincluded in the approved plan. 4. <T3>Records Retention.</T3> All Central Service Cost Allocation Plans andrelated documentation used as a basis for claiming costs under FederalAwards must be retained for audit in accordance with the Records Retentionrequirements contained in the ``Uniform Requirements for Grants and CooperativeAgreements with State and Local Governments (Common Regulations)'' or otherapplicable regulations. 5. <T3>Appeals.</T3> If a dispute arises in the negotiation of a plan betweenthe cognizant agency and the governmental unit, the dispute shall be resolvedin accordance with the appeals procedures of the cognizant agency.6. <T3>OMB Assistance.</T3> To the extent that problems are encountered amongthe Federal agencies in connection with the negotiation and approval process,the Office of Management and Budget will lend assistance as required toresolve such problems in a timely manner. <ITAG tagnum="84">Attachment D_Public Assistance Cost Allocation Plans</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Table of Contents</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">A.

Federally-financed programs administered by State public assistanceagencies are funded predominately by the Department of Health and HumanServices (HHS). In support of their stewardship requirements, HHS has publishedrequirements for the development, documentation, submission, negotiationand approval of public assistance cost allocation plans in Subpart E of45 CFR Part 95. All administrative costs (direct and indirect) are normallycharged to Federal awards by implementating the public assistance costallocation plan. It is the purpose of this Attachment to extend these requirementsto all Federal agencies whose programs are administered by a State publicassistance agency. Major Federally-financed programs typically administeredby State public assistance agencies include: Aid for Families with DependentChildren, Medicaid, Food Stamps, Child Support Enforcement, Adoption Assistanceand Foster Care, and Social Services.2. An interim guide has also been developed by the Department of Healthand Human Services entitled ``A Guide for State and Local Government PublicAssistance Agencies/Departments_Procedures for the Preparation and Submissionof Cost Allocation Plans''. A copy of this guide may be obtained from HHS.B. Definitions1. <T3>State public assistance agency </T3>means the State agency administeringor supervising the administration of the public assistance programs operatedby the State as identified by Subpart E of 45 CFR Part 95. For the purposeof this Attachment, these programs would also include all other programsadministered by State public assistance agencies.2. <T3>Public Assistance Cost Allocation Plan </T3>means a narrative descriptionof the procedures that will be used in identifying, measuring and allocatingall ``State public assistance agency costs'' (as defined in paragraph 3.below) to all of the programs administered or supervised by the State agency.3. <T3>State public assistance agency costs </T3>includes all costs incurredby, or allocable to, the State public assistance agency, except expendituresfor financial assistance, medical vendor payments, food stamp coupons,and payments for services and goods provided directly to program recipients.C. PolicyState public assistance agencies will develop, document and implement,and the Federal Government will review, negotiate and approve, public assistancecost allocation plans in accordance with Subpart E of 45 CFR Part 95. Theplan will include all programs administered by the State public assistanceagency. Where a letter of approval or disapproval is transmitted to a Statepublic assistance agency in accordance with Subpart E, it will apply toall Federal agencies and programs. The remaining sections of this Attachmentsummarize the provisions of Subpart E of 45 CFR Part 95.D. Submission, Documentation and Approval of Public Assistance Cost AllocationPlans1. A currently approved public assistance cost allocation plan will continuein effect until the occurrence of an event that would make the currentplan outdated. At that time, the State public assistance agency is requiredto promptly develop and submit an amendment to the cost allocation planto HHS for review and approval.2. Under the coordination process outlined in Subpart E, affected Federalagencies will review all new plans and plan amendments and provide commentsas appropriate to HHS. The effective date of the plan or plan amendmentwill be the first day of the quarter following the submission of the planor amendment unless another date is specifically approved by HHS. HHS,as the cognizant agency acting on behalf of all affected Federal agencies,will, as necessary, conduct negotiations with the State public assistanceagency and will inform the State agency of the action taken on the planor plan amendment.E. Review of Implementation of Approved Plans1. Since public assistance cost allocation plans are of a narrative nature,the review during the plan approval process consists of evaluating theappropriateness of the proposed groupings of costs (cost centers) and therelated allocation bases. As such, the Federal Government needs some assurancethat the cost allocation plan has been implemented as approved. This isaccomplished by reviews by the funding agencies, audits under OMB CircularA-128, or audits conducted by the cognizant audit agency.2. Where inappropriate charges affecting more than one funding agency areidentified, the HHS cost negotiation office will be advised and will takethe lead in resolving the issue(s) as provided for in Subpart E. If a disallowanceinvolving two or more funding agencies is required, it will be issued byHHS on behalf of all affected Federal agencies.3. If a dispute arises in the negotiation of a plan or from a disallowanceinvolving two or more funding agencies, the dispute shall be resolved inaccordance with the appeals procedures set out in 45 CFR Part 75. Disputesinvolving only one funding agency will be resolved in accordance with thefunding agency's appeal process.4. To the extent that problems are encountered among the Federal agenciesin connection with the negotiation and approval process, the Office ofManagement and Budget will lend assistance as required to resolve suchproblems in a timely manner.<ITAG tagnum="84">Attachment E_State/Local Indirect Cost Rate Proposals</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Table of Contents</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">A.

Indirect costs are those that have been incurred for common or jointpurposes benefiting more than one cost objective and cannot be readilyidentified with a particular final cost objective without effort disproportionateto the results achieved. After direct costs have been determined and assigneddirectly to Federal awards and other activities as appropriate, indirectcosts are those remaining to be allocated to benefiting cost objectives.A cost may not be allocated to a Federal award as an indirect cost if anyother cost incurred for the same purpose, in like circumstances, has beenassigned to an award as a direct cost.2. Indirect costs include (a) the indirect costs originating in each granteedepartment or agency performing Federal awards and (b) the costs of centralgovernmental services distributed through the central service cost allocationplan (as described in Attachment C) not otherwise treated as direct costs.3. Indirect costs are normally charged to Federal awards by the use ofan indirect cost rate. A separate indirect cost rate(s) is usually necessaryfor each grantee department or agency claiming indirect costs under Federalawards. Guidelines and illustrations of indirect cost proposals are providedin a brochure published by the Department of Health and Human Servicesentitled ``A Guide for State and Local Government Agencies: Cost Principlesand Procedures for Establishing Cost Allocation Plans and Indirect CostRates for Grants and Contracts with the Federal Government.'' A copy ofthis brochure may be obtained from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S.Government Printing Office.4. Because of the diverse characteristics and accounting practices of Stateand local agencies and Indian tribal governments, it is not possible tospecify the types of costs which may be classified as indirect costs inall situations. However, typical examples of indirect costs may includecertain State/local-wide central service costs, general administrationof the grantee department or agency, accounting and personnel servicesperformed within the grantee department or agency, depreciation or useallowances on buildings and equipment, the costs of operating and maintainingfacilities, etc.5. This Attachment does not apply to State public assistance agencies.These agencies should refer instead to Attachment D.B. Definitions1. <T3>Indirect cost rate proposal</T3> means the documentation prepared bya State or local agency or Indian tribal government to substantiate itsclaim for the reimbursement of indirect costs.2. <T3>Indirect cost rate</T3> is a device for determining in a reasonablemanner what proportion of indirect costs each program should bear. It isthe ratio (expressed as a percentage) of the indirect costs to a directcost base.3. <T3>Indirect cost pool</T3> is the accumulated costs that jointly benefittwo or more programs or other cost objectives.4. <T3>Base</T3> means the accumulated direct costs (normally either totaldirect salaries and wages or total direct costs exclusive of any extraordinaryor distorting expenditures) used to distribute indirect costs to individualFederal awards. The direct cost base selected should result in each programbearing a fair share of the indirect costs in reasonable relation to thebenefits received from the costs.5. <T3>Predetermined rate</T3> means an indirect cost rate, applicable toa specified current or future period, usually the governmental unit's fiscalyear. This rate is based on an estimate of the costs to be incurred duringthe period. Except under very unusual circumstances, a predetermined rateis not subject to adjustment. (Because of legal constraints, predeterminedrates are not permitted for Federal contracts; they may, however, be usedfor grants or cooperative agreements.) Predetermined rates may not be usedby governmental units that have not submitted and negotiated the rate withthe cognizant agency.6. <T3>Fixed rate</T3> means an indirect cost rate which has the same characteristicsas a predetermined rate, except that the difference between the estimatedcosts and the actual costs of the period covered by the rate is carriedforward as an adjustment to the rate computation of a subsequent period.7. <T3>Provisional rate</T3> means a temporary indirect cost rate applicableto a specified period which is used for funding, interim reimbursement,and reporting indirect costs on awards pending the establishment of a ``final''rate for that period.8. <T3>Final rate</T3> means an indirect cost rate applicable to a specifiedpast period which is based on the actual allowable costs of the period.A final rate is not subject to adjustment.9. <T3>Base period</T3> for the allocation of indirect costs is the periodin which such costs are incurred and accumulated for allocation to activitiesperformed in that period. The base period normally should coincide withthe grantee department or agency's fiscal year, but in any event, shallbe so selected as to avoid inequities in the allocation of costs.C. Allocation of Indirect Costs and Determination of Indirect Cost Rates1. <T3>General.</T3> a. Where a grantee department or agency has only onemajor function, or where all its major functions benefit from its indirectcosts to approximately the same degree, the allocation of indirect costsand the computation of an indirect cost rate may be accomplished throughsimplified allocation procedures as described in paragraph 2. below.b. Where a grantee department or agency has several major functions whichbenefit from its indirect costs in varying degrees, the allocation of indirectcosts may require the accumulation of such costs into separate cost groupingswhich then are allocated individually to benefiting functions by meansof a base which best measures the relative degree of benefit. The indirectcosts allocated to each function are then distributed to individual awardsand other activities included in that function by means of an indirectcosts rate(s).c. Specific methods for allocating indirect costs and computing indirectcost rates along with the conditions under which each method should beused are described in paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 below.2. <T3>Simplified Method.</T3> a. Where a grantee agency's major functionsbenefit from its indirect costs to approximately the same degree, the allocationof indirect costs may be accomplished by (i) classifying the grantee agency'stotal costs for the base period as either direct or indirect, and (ii)dividing the total allowable indirect costs (net of applicable credits)by an equitable distribution base. The result of this process is an indirectcost rate which is used to distribute indirect costs to individual Federalawards. The rate should be expressed as the percentage which the totalamount of allowable indirect costs bears to the base selected. This methodshould also be used where a grantee department or agency has only one majorfunction encompassing a number of individual projects or activities, andmay be used where the level of Federal awards to that department or agencyis relatively small.b. Both the direct costs and the indirect costs should exclude capitalexpenditures and unallowable costs. However, unallowable costs which representactivities must be included in the direct costs if they represent activitiesto which indirect costs are properly allocable.c. The distribution base may be total direct costs (excluding capital expendituresand other distorting items, such as flow-through funds, major subcontracts,etc.), direct salaries and wages, or other base which results in an equitabledistribution.3. <T3>Multiple Allocation Base Method.</T3> a. Where a grantee agency's indirectcosts benefit its major functions in varying degrees, such costs shallbe accumulated into separate cost groupings. Each grouping shall then beallocated individually to benefiting functions by means of a base whichbest measures the relative benefits.b. The cost groupings should be established so as to permit the allocationof each grouping on the basis of benefits provided to the major functions.Each grouping should constitute a pool of expenses that are of like characterin terms of the functions they benefit and in terms of the allocation basewhich best measures the relative benefits provided to each function. Thenumber of separate groupings should be held within practical limits, takinginto consideration the materiality of the amounts involved and the degreeof precision needed.c. Actual conditions must be taken into account in selecting the base tobe used in allocating the expenses in each grouping to benefiting functions.When an allocation can be made by assignment of a cost grouping directlyto the function benefited, the allocation shall be made in that manner.When the expenses in a grouping are more general in nature, the allocationshould be made through the use of a selected base which produces resultsthat are equitable to both the Federal Government and the grantee departmentor agency. In general, any cost element or cost related factor associatedwith the agency's activities is potentially adaptable for use as an allocationbase provided that: (i) it can readily be expressed in terms of dollarsor other quantitative measures (total direct costs, direct salaries andwages, staff hours applied, square feet used, hours of usage, number ofdocuments processed, population served, and the like); and (ii) it is commonto the benefiting functions during the base period.d. Except where a special indirect cost rate(s) is required in accordancewith paragraph 4 below, the separate groupings of indirect costs allocatedto each major function shall be aggregated and treated as a common poolfor that function. The costs in the common pool shall then be distributedto individual awards included in that function by use of a single indirectcost rate.e. The distribution base used in computing the indirect cost rate for eachfunction may be total direct costs (excluding capital expenditures andother distorting items such as flow-through funds, major subcontracts,etc.), direct salaries and wages, or other base which results in an equitabledistribution. An indirect cost rate should be developed for each separateindirect cost pool developed. The rate in each case should be stated asthe percentage relationship between the particular indirect cost pool andthe distribution base identified with that pool.4. <T3>Special Indirect Cost Rates.</T3> a. In some instances, a single indirectcost rate for all activities of a grantee department or agency or for eachmajor function of the agency may not be appropriate. It may not take intoaccount those different factors which may substantially affect the indirectcosts applicable to a particular program or group of programs. The factorsmay include the physical location of the work, the level of administrativesupport required, the nature of the facilities or other resources employed,the organizational arrangements used or any combination thereof. When aparticular program(s) is performed in an environment which appears to generatea significantly different level of indirect costs, provisions should bemade for a separate indirect cost pool applicable to that program(s). Theseparate indirect cost pool should be developed during the course of theregular allocation process, and the separate indirect cost rate resultingtherefrom should be used, provided: (i) The rate differs significantlyfrom the rate which would have been developed under paragraphs 2. and 3.above, and (ii) the programs to which the rate would apply are materialin amount.b. Although this Circular adopts the concept of the full reimbursementof indirect costs, there are some Federal statutes which restrict the reimbursementof certain indirect costs on Federal awards. Where such restrictions existit may be necessary to develop a special rate for the affected program.Where a ``restricted rate'' is required, the same procedure for developinga non-restricted rate will be used except for the additional step of theelimination from the indirect cost pool those costs for which the law prohibitsreimbursement.D. Submission and Documentation of Proposals1. <T3>Submission of Indirect Cost Proposals.</T3> a. All grantee departmentsor agencies desiring to claim indirect costs under Federal awards mustprepare an indirect cost proposal and related documentation to supportthose costs. The proposal and related documentation must be retained foraudit in accordance with the Records Retention requirements contained inthe ``Uniform Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements with Stateand Local Governments (Common Regulation)'' or other applicable regulations.b. State and local grantee agencies for which cognizance assignments havebeen designated must submit their indirect cost proposals to their cognizantagency. OMB will periodically publish lists of State and local agenciesidentifying the appropriate Federal cognizant agencies. The cognizant agencyfor all grantee agencies not identified by OMB will be determined basedon the Federal agency providing the largest amount of Federal funds. Inthese cases, grantee agencies must develop indirect cost proposals in accordancewith the requirements of this Circular and maintain the proposal and relatedsupporting documentation for audit. These grantee agencies are not requiredto submit their proposals unless they are specifically requested to doso by the cognizant agency.c. All Indian tribal governments desiring reimbursement of indirect costsmust submit their indirect cost proposals to the Department of Interior(their cognizant Federal agency).d. Indirect cost proposals must be developed (and, when required, submitted)within six months after the close of each of the governmental units fiscalyears, unless an exception is approved by the cognizant Federal agency.If at that time the proposed central service plan for the same period hasnot been approved, the indirect cost proposal may be prepared includingan amount for central services that is based on the latest available centralservice cost allocation plan. The difference between these central serviceamounts and the amounts ultimately approved will be compensated for byan adjustment in a subsequent period.2. <T3>Documentation of Proposals.</T3> The following should be included witheach indirect cost proposal:a. The rates proposed, including subsidiary worksheets and other relevantdata cross-referenced and reconciled to the financial data noted in paragraphb. below. Allocated central service costs will be supported by the summarytable included in the proposed central service cost allocation plan (thisis not required if the central service cost allocation plan for the samefiscal year has been approved by the cognizant agency).b. A copy of the financial data (financial statements, budgets, accountingreports, etc.) upon which the rate is based. Adjustments resulting fromthe use of unaudited data will be recognized, where appropriate, by theFederal cognizant agency in a subsequent proposal.c. The approximate amount of direct base costs incurred under Federal awards.These costs should be broken out between salaries and wages and other directcosts.d. A chart showing the organizational structure of the agency during theperiod for which the proposal applies, along with a functional statement(s)noting the duties and/or responsibilities of all units that comprise theagency. (Once this is submitted, only revisions need be submitted withsubsequent proposals.)e. A certification that the proposal was prepared in accordance with thisCircular, that it contains only allowable indirect costs, and that it wasprepared in a manner that treats similar costs among the Federal programsand between Federal and non-Federal programs consistently.E. Negotiation and Approval of Rates1. Indirect cost rates will be reviewed, negotiated, and approved by thecognizant Federal agency on a timely basis. Once a rate has been agreedupon it will be accepted and used by all Federal agencies unless prohibitedor limited by statute. Where a Federal funding agency has reason to believethat special operating factors affecting its awards necessitate specialindirect cost rates, it will, prior to the time the rates are negotiated,notify the cognizant Federal agency.2. The use of predetermined rates is encouraged where there is reasonableassurance based on past experience and reliable projection of the granteeagency's costs, that the rate is not likely to exceed a rate based on itsactual costs. Long-term agreements utilizing predetermined rates extendingover two or more years are encouraged where appropriate.3. The results of each negotiation shall be formalized in a written agreementbetween the cognizant agency and the governmental unit. This agreementwill be subject to re-opening, only at the option of the cognizant agency,and then only if: (i) It is subsequently found to violate a statute; (ii)the information provided by the governmental unit upon which the cognizantagency relied during the proposal review and negotiation process is laterfound to be materially incomplete or inaccurate; or (iii) the cognizantagency was not made aware of major changes in accounting practices thatoccurred during the effective period of the agreement. The agreed uponrates will be made available to all Federal agencies for their use.F. Other Policies1. <T3>Fringe Benefit Rates. </T3>If overall fringe benefit rates are notapproved for the governmental unit as part of the central service costsallocation plan, these rates will be reviewed, negotiated and approvedfor individual grantee agencies during the indirect cost negotiation process.In these cases, a proposed fringe benefit rate computation should accompanythe indirect cost proposal.
