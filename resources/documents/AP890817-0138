JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An environmental group accused theEnvironmental Protection Agency on Thursday of contributing toincreased air pollution by promoting the burning of toxic wastes.   The EPA issued a statement saying the group ``seriouslydistorts'' the agency's role in the disposal of such wastes and thatits primary goal is to promote waste reduction, not a particularmethod of disposal or treatment.   The National Toxics Campaign Fund, a private organization thatfocuses on toxic pollution issues, told a news conference outsidethe agency's headquarters EPA's policies will ``encourage more toxicwaste production.''   The group argued that the EPA does not focus enough in gettingcompanies and industrial plants to invest in technology that wouldreduce toxic emissions.   Instead, the critics maintained, agency policy requires state andlocal officials to develop new toxic disposal facilities such asadditional landfills or incinerators.   ``New disposal capacity will only encourage toxic wasteproduction,'' said the group. It said putting such wastes inlandfills risks pollution through leakage and the burning toxicwastes results in the release of ``massive quanities of toxic fumesand carcinogenic compunds'' into the air.   ``The only thing we're prompting is waste reduction,'' said EPAspokeswoman Robin Woods. ``We're encouraging (states) to considerall waste reduction opportunities. Secondly we're looking at them tolook at existing (disposal) facilities out of state. And as a lastresort build new facilities.''   She said that the EPA requires strict emission controls whentoxic wastes are burned.   Congress has directed states to certify by next October to theEPA that they have enough toxic waste disposal capacity to managewastes generated over the next 20 years.   Ms. Woods said the EPA has yet to receive any of the state toxicwaste disposal plans that are due Oct. 17 and that she could not sayto what extent states intend to rely on incineration.</TEXT></DOC>
