As the body of Yaacov Ben Shanan, was buried in a militarycemetery here, his youngest daughter and a son who is a regulararmy soldier both fainted. Shanan, 44, was a reservist on a week'sduty in Lebanon when he was killed by Wednesday's blast.   The Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army detained five Shiites fromsouthern Lebanon on suspicion of preparing the bomb, Israel radioreported. It said the militia interrogated about 400 Shiites anddozens of Sunni Moslems.   Israel's leaders promised retaliation against the Hezbollah, orParty of God, the militant organization of fundamentalist Moslemswhich claimed responsibility for the bombing.   ``We have to strike at these people of blood and terroreverywhere and at every opportunity,'' said Prime Minister YitzhakShamir, specifically naming the Hezbollah as ``one of the mostextreme terror organizations.''   Defense Miister Yitzhak Rabin told Israel radio: ``We will seekout, reveal and punish those who carried out the terrible crimeyesterday.''   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said he was certain the attackerswould be punished. ``I am sure that the state of Israel and the IDF(Israeli Defense Force, or army) will not remain still until wereach the source of evil, the source of the attack.''   In Israel, six political parties, including Shamir's hard-lineLikud bloc, canceled campaign broadcasts to mourn the dead.Parliamentary elections are scheduled for Nov. 1.   State Department spokesman Charles Redman appealed in Washingtonon Thursday for ``security and stability for everyone'' but saidnothing of the threat of Israeli revenge.   Syrian troops in Lebanon went on alert in anticipation of anIsraeli attack, according to Christian radio broadcasts monitoredin Tel Aviv. The broadcasts said Israeli warplanes flew severaltimes at low height over Lebanese territory, including the citiesof Sidon and Khalde.   An army spokesman said Israeli troops in the security zone thatIsrael maintains in south Lebanon worked checkpoints and questionedLebanese drivers.   Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, army chief of staff, told Israel radio theattack could have been carried out by ``maybe two people.'' He saidregulations would be enacted to try to minimize any more bombings.   The car bomb exploded Wednesday afternoon as two Israeli armyconvoys were passing. The vehicle, which carried up to 330 poundsof explosives, was destroyed, and the body of the suicide driverwas not found.   The bomb injured eight other soldiers and two Lebanese women. Itwas the deadliest attack on Israeli soldiers in Lebanon since a carbomb killed 12 and injured 14 in March 1985.   The attack came a few yards from the Israeli border in thesecurity zone that Israel set up in 1985 when it pulled most of itstroops out of Lebanon, ending a three-year occupation of the south.Foreign reports say Israel still keeps about 1,000 troops in astrip up to 10 miles deep along the border.   On Thursday in South Lebanon, Shiite families were reportedfleeing to the north in fear of an Israeli reprisal.   Also Thursday, loudspeaker-equipped cars from the Hezbollahtoured South Lebanon, blaring hymns and chants praising ``themartyr who carried out the heroic attack against the Zionists.''   At Baalbek in eastern Lebanon, Hezbollah spokesman Ahmad Qamarsaid his forces were on alert throughout the country in expectationof Israeli revenge. He also said the car bomb attack ``will not bethe last one.''   ``We expect an Israeli aggression any minute and we areconfident that the sons of Islam will be victorious,'' he said.   At the Holon Military Cemetery near Tel Aviv, a rabbi who prayedover Yaacov Bar Shanan's grave called the attackers ``vampires ...bloodthirsty enemies.''</TEXT></DOC>
