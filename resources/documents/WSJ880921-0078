Jurors were told that Mr. Burleson planted a virus, or rogue program, in the computer system used to store records at USPA andamp; IRA Co., a Fort Worth insurance and brokerage firm. A virus is a computer program, often hidden in apparently normal computer software, that instructs the computer to change or destroy information at a given time or after a certain sequence of commands.    Davis McCown, Tarrant County's assistant district attorney, told the jury the virus was programmed in the manner of a time bomb and was activated Sept. 21, 1985, two days after Burleson was fired from his job as a programmer at the firm.    The virus was discovered two days later, after it had eliminated 168,000 payroll records, holding up company paychecks for more than a month.    Damage to the system could have amounted to hundreds of thousands of dollars had the virus continued undetected, Mr. McCown said. </TEXT></DOC>
