Discusses tests madeon coal-shale phenolic compositions and fillers in the form of coal dustfrom the Tsentral'naya mine (Kuznetsk basin), consisting mainly (99%)of particles less than 0.1 mm, and containing 14.1% volatiles. Combinedshale phenols and industrial furfural were used as binders (ratio 60:40%mass). Activation of carbonized granules was carried out in electricallyheated rotary oven at 920 C in a stream of water vapor (8-12 hr.) Statesthat replacement of shale binder by wood tar results in reduction ofsorptional and strength factors of carbon adsorbents. 5 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
