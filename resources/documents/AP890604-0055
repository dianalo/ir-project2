Shigeo Muraoka, Japan's vice minister for international tradeand industry, said he considered filing an official complaintbefore the 96-nation trade forum a ``possible approach.''   The U.S. government last month identified Japan, Brazil andIndia as nations that had erected unfair barriers against importsof American goods, in line with a recently beefed up section of aU.S. trade act known as Super 301.   The new rule has irritated Japan, the European EconomicCommunity and other competitors because it opens the way forWashington to impose retaliatory sanctions without waiting forGATT's permission.   ``The U.S. hasn't done anything that would be a basis for a(Japanese) complaint,'' U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said.``We have simply exposed, open for the world to see, where tradebarriers are.''   ``If we have to retaliate, we've failed in our discussions,''she added. ``We don't like to fail.''   Trade minsters from the U.S., Japan, Canada and the 12-nationEEC are meeting informally in the Hague.   Muraoka, who spoke to reporters after the meeting, said the newU.S. law ``seriously undermines the spirit of free trade.''   He said the U.S. should ask GATT to set up a panel toinvestigate the American allegations to resolve the dispute,Muraoka said.   Alternatively, Japan might request a GATT working group todetermine whether the law is consistent with the trade forum'srules, he said. GATT should also encourage bilateral talks betweenWashington and other nations targeted by the measure, Muraoka said.   The EEC has sharply criticized the trade act and said theEuropean trade bloc or any of its member nations could be targetedby the new rule in the future.   Super 301 requires the U.S. government to announce publicly whatcountries it suspects of protectionism and to begin bilateral talksin order to resolve the problem.   The U.S. claims that if talks fail it can impose trade sanctionsagainst the offending nation without GATT permission. GATT rulessay permission is necessary.</TEXT></DOC>
