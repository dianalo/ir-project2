(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Democratic presidential contender MichaelDukakis, fresh from a solid win in New York's big primary, waslooking to consolidate his strength with a repeat performance herenext week. But rival Jesse Jackson warned not to count him out.   A prize of 178 delegates, the fourth-largest of any state race,is at stake in next Tuesday's primary here.   ``Tomorrow, we take our message ... to Pennsylvania and Ohio andIndiana,'' Dukakis said in a victory speech in New York. ``Andafter that, we will take our message _ the Democratic message _ toevery part of the country.''   The Jackson camp offered congratulations, but said the New Yorkprimary didn't settle things.   ``We continue to win. We have won,'' Jackson told supporters inNew York. ``Our campaign continues to grow.''   ``We think we're still in this race,'' said Jackson's campaignmanager, Gerald Austin. Jackson was heading to Pennsylvania tonight.   Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr., who finished a distant third inNew York, was considering abandoning his presidential bid.   On the Republican side, Vice President George Bush, who isvirtually assured his party's nomination, campaigned Tuesday in thestate.   A poll in today's editions of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette andPhiladelphia Daily News indicated Dukakis led Jesse Jackson amonglikely Democratic voters primary by a 59-20 margin. The poll of 647likely Democratic voters, conducted Tuesday through Sunday, had amargin of error of plus or minus five percentage points.   ``The most likely scenario is that Dukakis uses Pennsylvania tosolidify his front-runnership, his hold on the nomination,'' saidLt. Gov. Mark Singel, a Democrat who is neutral in the race.   Jackson supporters complained that Pennsylvania'sdelegate-selection system stacks the cards against their candidate.The state's popular vote is merely a beauty contest and the realwinner in the primary must succeed in elections in the state's 23congressional districts.   ``We could win the state and lose 80 percent of the delegates,''said Steve Cobble, Jackson's delegate coordinator, calling theprocess ``one of the last vestiges of Republican-type politics inthe Democratic Party.''   ``It ought to be done away with,'' Cobble said.   Jackson's strength is largely in three of the 23 districts, inPhiladelphia and Pittsburgh, where most of the state's blacks live.Blacks make up about 11 percent of state's voting-age population.   ``Even in the best scenario, how he (Jackson) gets more than 30delegates, I don't know,'' said G. Terry Madonna, director of theCenter for Politics and Public Affairs at Millersville University.``If it's a two-man race, it could be 3-1 Dukakis.''   Jackson has only 79 candidates for 116 delegate slots to befilled from Pennsylvania's 23 congressional districts. Another 62pledged delegates will be appointed in June based on the delegatedivision Tuesday.   To fill in the delegate gaps, the Jackson campaign said Tuesdayit has mounted a ``Dropouts Turn To Jesse'' program to recruitdelegate candidates pledged to Democratic hopefuls who have leftthe field.   ``It's going well,'' said spokeswoman Janice Fine. ``We have anumber thinking about it, no question.''   She said the campaign already has commitments from 8 to 10delegates and is working to fill other holes in Jackson's delegatefield.   But he said the outcome in Pennsylvania would not dampenJackson's continuing campaign.   State Democratic Chairman Larry Yatch said Jackson would carryPhiladelphia. ``The rest of the state, at least demographically,doesn't seem to bode well for Jackson,'' Yatch said.   Singel, the lieutenant governor, also predicted Dukakis wouldwin, but said Jackson would do better than most Democraticofficials believe.   ``I'll make a prediction to you that Jesse Jackson will getbetween 35 and 40 percent of the popular vote in Pennsylvania,'' hesaid.   The Dukakis campaign has said it's ready for a fight inPennsylvania.   ``Mike is taking nothing for granted,'' said his Pennsylvaniaspokesman Pat McCarthy. He added, however, that a win inPennsylvania could put Dukakis ``over the psychological top.''   Jackson's workers, however, remained upbeat.   ``As far as I can see, everything is going fine. We've got greatexpectations in Pennsylvania,'' said Jamillah Muhammad, a nationalJackson campaign staffer working in Pittsburgh.   Jackson, who won 16 percent of the vote and 18 delegates in athree-way primary race in 1984, hopes to court disaffectedblue-collar workers in southwestern Pennsylvania, whereunemployment still reaches double digits in some areas.   ``We'll do better than in 1984, exceed expectations and giveDukakis a hell of a run for his money,'' said Ms. Fine. ``We'revery competitive in Pennsylvania.''</TEXT></DOC>
