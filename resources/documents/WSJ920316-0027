Reynolds Tobacco Co. plans to launch a new cigarettecalled Winston Select in May, marking its latest attempt tolure smokers out of Marlboro country.   The nation's No. 2 tobacco merchant is counting on WinstonSelect to help halt the long slide of its flagship brand.Winston was America's best-selling cigarette until 1974, whenit was surpassed by Marlboro, made by archrival Philip MorrisCos. Since then, Winston loyalists have increasingly tradeddown to cheaper cigarettes, kicked the habit or died off.Last year, Winston's share of U.S. cigarette shipments wasabout 7.4%, compared with Marlboro's leading 26% share.</LP><TEXT>   The introduction is part of a broader effort by thetobacco unit of RJR Nabisco Holdings Inc. to prop up itswaning full-priced cigarette brands with new products. Forexample, the company is launching a fatter version of itsCamel filter cigarettes. And last year, it concocted newpackaging for Winston and Salem cigarettes designed to keepthem fresh longer.   But it is open to question whether today's increasinglyvalue-oriented smokers will warm up to a new full-pricedpermutation -- or even understand how it differs from thestandard Winston brand.   To lure Marlboro smokers, the company says, Winston Selectwill contain a new blend of tobacco, intended to give aslightly smoother, milder flavor. But the new smoke willdeliver the punch macho smokers expect. Winston Select willcontain about 18 milligrams of tar and 1.4 milligrams ofnicotine -- comparable to regular Winston.   Packs for the new cigarettes will be a deeper red and willhave a larger version of the brand's trademark gold eaglethan the traditional Winston packaging. &quot;It's meant to givethe new brand a premium look,&quot; said a spokeswoman for thecompany.   Company officials said advertising for Winston Select isbeing developed by Trone Advertising, a small agency based inGreensboro, N.C. Trone helped develop the company'scontroversial Old Joe campaign for its Camel brand. Thanks inpart to Joe Camel, R.J. Reynolds has had some success inattracting youthful Marlboro smokers to its Camel filters.Despite Trone's involvement in the launch, the company saidFCB/Leber Katz Partners in New York will remain the mainagency for the Winston brand.</TEXT></DOC>
