One other policeman and 11 prison guards who recently joined anew union headed by Lt. Gregory Rockman also were arrested at thedemonstration. Police Commissioner Hennie de Witt said the secondpoliceman also was suspended.   All 13 were released without bail after brief court appearanceswhere they were not charged. They are scheduled to reappear Nov. 23.   Three private citizens were arrested at the demonstration andreleased on bail. Eight journalists covering their protest weredetained for two hours, then freed. They included a camera crewfrom ABC News.   The dissident security officers were protesting in themixed-race township of Mitchell's Plain, Rockman's hometown,against police orders to transfer him to a quartermaster's unit ina white area of Cape Town. Rockman is mixed-race.   Police also ordered the transfer of Col. John Manuel, thecommander of the Mitchell's Plain police station, who had supportedRockman.   De Witt said Rockman failed to report for duty Monday at thequartermaster's office, rejecting a transfer that was ``in theinterests of good order and discipline.''   The arrests occurred after Rockman and the other dissidentofficers marched through a shopping area of Mitchell's Plain,chanting in support of their union and against Rockman's transferorder.   After the court appearance, supporters carried Rockman on theirshoulders to a public square and shouted, ``Viva Rockman!''   Rockman become an overnight hero to militant youths inSeptember, when he accused members of an all-white police riotsquad of behaving like ``wild dogs'' when they beat anti-electionprotesters. That protest occurred at the same shopping plaza whereRockman was arrested Monday.   Two white officers were charged with assault in the Septemberincident. They were acquitted last month, but the judge criticizedthe behavior of some men in the unit.</TEXT></DOC>
