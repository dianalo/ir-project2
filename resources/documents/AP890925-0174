Baker III saidMonday he would try to set up a three-way meeting with the foreignministers of Egypt and Israel next week to find a way for Israel tohold negotiations with Palestinian Arabs.   Baker, at a news conference, praised both a proposal by IsraeliPrime Minister Yitzhak Shamir for elections on the West Bank and inGaza to choose Palestinians for the talks and another by EgyptianPresident Hosni Mujbarak that he select the Palestinians.   President Bush, in New York for a speech to the U.N. GeneralAssembly, met separately with Israeli Deputy Prime Minister ShimonPeres and Foreign Minister Moshe Arens.   Mubarak wants Israel to commit itself in advance to surrenderingland in exchange for Arab recognition. Shamir is against the idea,but Peres, who heads the Israeli Labor party, accepts theproposition.   The Palestine Liberation Organization, meanwhile, has dismissedShamir's plan as a ploy to prevent establishment of a state.   Baker had intended to hold a three-way meeting this week in NewYork with Arens and the Egyptian Foreign Minister, EsmetAbdul-Meguid.   But U.S. officals said the Egyptian had a schedule problem andcould not be there.   ``I can't tell you exactly when the meeting will be held,''Baker said. ``But I would suspect that within the course of thenext week we'll be able to arrange that meeting.''   He said the Bush administration was still committed to Shamir'sproposal and said Mubarak's proposals are ``a potential way ofgetting there.''</TEXT></DOC>
