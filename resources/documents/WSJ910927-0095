In addition, inflation-adjusted median household incomedeclined for the first time since 1982.</LP><TEXT>   The growth in the ranks of the poor to 13.5% of the U.S.population, from 12.8% in 1989, reflects the punishingeffects of the recession on all races and income groups. Butthe recession's effect on median household income variedgreatly by region, declining an inflation-adjusted 5% in theNortheast and 3% in the West, but not changing significantlyin the Midwest or the South.   Median household income declined 1.7% for all Americans to$29,943 from $30,468 in 1989. White and Hispanic householdssuffered especially steep declines of 2.6% and 3.4%,respectively.   Black households experienced a smaller decline in medianincome, which the Census Bureau judged statisticallyinsignificant. But large income disparities remained, withblack households showing a median income of $18,676, comparedwith $31,231 for whites and $22,330 for Hispanics.   Asian and Pacific Islander households experienced a slightincrease in median household income, to $38,450 from $38,053in 1989, but the Census Bureau also judged this changestatistically insignificant.   The number of households below the poverty line is likelyto increase even faster in 1991, according to RobertGreenstein, executive director of the Center on Budget andPolicy Priorities, a nonprofit research group based inWashington. Mr. Greenstein based his claim on the fact thatunemployment has increased more rapidly this year than last.   The official poverty line, which varies according to suchfactors as family size and age, averages $13,359 for a familyof four and $6,652 for an individual.   Furthermore, a study released this week by thecongressional Joint Economic Committee suggests that the poorno longer benefit from economic recovery to the degree thatthey once did. According to the study, written by RebeccaBlank of Northwestern University, the poverty rate declinedless than three percentage points between 1983 and 1990,compared with a poverty-rate decline of nine percentagepoints in the expansion from 1961 to 1970.   The study attributed this disparity to falling wages,which largely offset the increased participation of poorpeople in the work force. &quot;`Trickling down' didn't work verywell in the 1980s,&quot; the report concluded.   Conservatives have long criticized the Census Bureau'sannual poverty survey for failing to take non-cash income andwelfare benefits into account when calculating how manyAmericans are in poverty. A separate report issued yesterdayby the Census Bureau found that several &quot;experimentalestimates&quot; of non-cash income and benefits showed asignificant increase in poverty rates from 1989 to 1990.   Daniel Weinberg, the Census Bureau's chief of householdeconomic statistics, said the bureau was working with theHealth and Human Services Department to find a more preciseway of calculating the value of such benefits.</TEXT></DOC>
