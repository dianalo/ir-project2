Credit market analysts said that few investors werewilling to brave the bond market ahead of today's report forfear the data might show the economy is improving rather thancontinuing to deteriorate.</LP><TEXT>   Although many economists expect the report to show a sharpdecline in retail sales, dealers said investors weren'ttaking any chances and stayed out of the market just in casethe economists are wrong.   &quot;Investors are confused about a lot of developments,&quot; saidPhilip Braverman, senior vice president at DKB GovernmentSecurities Inc. Rather than put additional money to work,many investors are sitting on the fence waiting for neweconomic statistics &quot;on hopes that the {retail sales} datawill give them a clearer indication of whether the rally willcontinue,&quot; he said.   The consensus estimate of economists surveyed by Dow JonesCapital Markets Report calls for a 0.9% decline in retailsales in January. That compares with actual declines of 0.4%in December and 0.1% in November.   The retail sales report measures consumer spending trends.A sharp decline in consumer spending could exacerbate thecurrent recession, prompting the Federal Reserve to reduceinterest rates further which, in turn, could lead to higherbond prices.   However, increased or stable consumer spending mightsuggest that the recession is ending, a trend that couldbring a halt to the recent bond market rally.   Mr. Braverman said that bond investors also are nervousbecause of the sharp runup in the stock market. Many stockinvestors are betting that the recession won't last very longand that business activity will start to grow again soon. Theeconomist said that bond investors worry that the euphoria inthe stock market is seeping into the bond market andprompting investors to sell bonds and use the proceeds to buystocks.   &quot;Whenever the market pauses, people start to worry thatothers are taking profits and moving out of bonds,&quot; he said.                                                                                                          Municipal Bonds                                                                                                          Investors and analysts expect New York City's $950 milliongeneral obligation bond sale today to draw strong demand fromboth small and large investors, despite the move by Moody'sInvestors Service Inc. on Monday to downgrade the city's debtrating.   Dealers said they expect investors to snap up the bondslargely because of attractive yields, which are expected torange from 6.5% for one-year notes to as high as 8.35% forlong-term bonds. The yield on the long-term bonds translatesto a taxable-equivalent yield of more than 12% for manyinvestors in high tax brackets.   Although a yield of 8.35% is considered extremely high forthe tax-exempt market, the yield is little changed fromlevels expected prior to the Moody's downgrade and areconsistent with current market rates for outstanding New YorkCity bonds. Moody's lowered the city's bond rating to Baa-1from single-A.   Today's bond sale, which will be lead managed by LehmanBrothers, is expected to comprise $750 million tax-exemptbonds and $200 million taxable securities. The city will alsosell $60 million of &quot;CitySaver&quot; bonds, which are zero-couponbonds. Zeros pay no interest but sell at a deep discount totheir face value. Small investors tend to be big buyers ofzeros and often purchase them for retirement or educationalaccounts.   In the previous New York GO bond sale, which was leadmanaged by First Boston, many brokers and dealers that caterlargely to small investors sharply criticized First Bostonfor reducing the size of the zero-coupon bond portion of theoffering at the last minute.   Some bond salesmen are hoping that under the lead ofLehman, a firm that has a strong retail customer base, smallinvestors will play a bigger role in this sale than theprevious sale, which catered largely to institutionalinvestors.   As the city is not authorized to sell zero-coupon bondsdirectly, ordinary interest-paying bonds maturing in 2006through 2008 will be sold to underwriters, who will thenstrip the bonds into their coupon payments and principalportions and resell them to investors as zero-coupon bonds.The zeros will mature approximately every six months from1992 to 2008.                                                                                                          Treasury Securities                                                                                                          Treasury bonds ended little changed. The benchmark 30-yearTreasury bond ended unchanged yesterday at a price of 9830/32 to yield 7.96%. Short-term securities, however, postedmodest gains. The latest two-year notes ended at a price of100 14/32 to yield 6.74% compared with 100 13/32 to yield6.76% on Monday.   Meanwhile, the Treasury sold $11.81 billion of 52-weekbills at an average rate of 5.85%. The rate was down from6.22% at the previous 52-week bill auction on Jan. 10.Yesterday's rate was the lowest at a 52-week bill sale since5.68% March 12, 1987.   Here are details of yesterday's auction:                                                                                                          Rates are determined by the difference between thepurchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrowsthe investor's return while lower bidding widens it. Thepercentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while thecoupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.                                                                                                                              52-Week Bills                                                                                                          Applications ......................... $33,692,245,000   Accepted bids ........................ $11,811,320,000   Accepted at low price ................             49%   Accepted noncompetitively ............  $1,171,445,000   Average price (Rate) .................  94.085 (5.85%)   High price (Rate) ....................  94.105 (5.83%)   Low price (Rate) .....................  94.085 (5.85%)   Coupon equivalent ....................           6.21%   CUSIP number .........................       912794XZ2                                                                                                          The bills are dated Feb. 14 and mature Feb. 13, 1992.                                                                                                          Corporate andamp; Junk Bonds                                                                                                          Corporate borrwers issued more than $1.2 billion ofcorporate debt.   Among the largest issuers was Halliburton Co., whichoffered $200 million of 30-year debentures priced to yield8.83%. The last time Halliburton tapped the public debtmarket was in 1981.   Robert Fielder, the company's treasurer, said the oilfield services company had been planning to borrow funds thisyear, but was spurred into action yesterday by the recentdrop in long-term rates. &quot;We felt the 30-year rate wasattractive at less than 9%,&quot; he said. Although &quot;long-termrates may go further down&quot; the company &quot;didn't want togamble.&quot;   Many of the issues that hit the market sold quickly. Anissue of May Department Stores Co.'s 30-year amortizingdebentures was increased after pricing to $125 million from$100 million, and bond sales by Unocal Corp. and Pitney BowesInc.'s Pitney Bowes Credit Corp. unit as well as theHalliburton issue were sold out.   In the broader market, prices of investment-gradecorporate bonds were little changed. In the junk-bond market,prices of high-yield, high-risk bonds ended 1/4 point higheron average.   Among the major market movers were bonds of AmBase Corp.,which jumped more than 30 points on news that the company'sstockholders have approved the sale of its wholly-ownedsubsidiary, Home Insurance Co., to TVH Acquisition Corp.   AmBase's 14.875% senior subordinated notes jumped 31 1/2points to 80.</TEXT></DOC>
