The following results were obtained by the analysis of the photographicobservational results on the characteristics of winter lightning: Asone feature of winter lightning, once lighting is generated, lightningtends to occur frequently and concentrically in a relatively short period.In contrast to lightning in summer season, only the barrier effect ofhigh towers is a characteristic of winter lightning useful for lightningresistant designs. The lightning current is increased as compared withthat at the leading stroke during the lightning. For a specific lightningpath, it was found that as soon as lightning struck the earth at threepoints, an inter-cloud lightning discharge of about 1.5 - 2 km in horizontallength was generated, and lowered to the one-fourth of the height ofthe cloud bottom. The newly developed equipment is a wide band recorderfor lightning discharge current wave form, a discriminating system oflightning discharge polarity, and a high response automatic camera.
