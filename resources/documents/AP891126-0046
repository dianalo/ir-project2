The main problem, say congressional and administrationofficials, is a lengthy deportation process that enables releasedconvicts to commit new crimes while their immigration cases arepending, a failure to control illegal immigration, or misplacedpriorities within the Immigration and Naturalization Service.   The result, says Rep. Lamar Smith of Texas, is ``that we'retaking about a massive problem, with potentially hundreds ofthousands of illegal aliens (in the country) who have committedcrimes.''   Smith is ranking Republican on the House Judiciary subcommitteeon immigration, refugees and international law.   Rep. Bruce Morrison, the subcommittee chairman, says the countryis ``overwhelmed'' with hundreds of thousands of criminal aliens,yet the INS is only deporting a fraction of them.   ``The priorities there (at INS) do not seem to be clear atall,'' said Morrison, D-Conn. ``You really can't be allowing alarge number of people who have committed crimes to remain (in thecountry). It makes a joke out of the system.''   INS spokesman Duke Austin said the agency has increased itsdeportations of criminal aliens _ those either convicted or accusedof a crime _ yet is bound by the law, which gives most criminalaliens the right to a full review of their cases in immigrationcourt pending deportation. An alien can prolong a deportation forat least a year and sometimes two years.   During that time, Austin said, aliens have been known to commitnew crimes and end up back in prison. According to Austin, thereare only 60 immigration judges nationwide handling thousands ofcases. And there is only one board to consider appeals fromdecisions made by those 60 judges.   Although the system may be abused in some cases, an immigrationrights activist says it protects everyone's right to due process.   ``There are lots of people who are legally entitled to be in thecountry, and who but for that process might be forcibly evicted,''said Charles Kamasaki, vice president for research, advocacy andlegislation for National Council of La Raza.   There also are those aliens, who with little English proficiencyor poor legal representation, are convicted of crimes yet ``by nostretch of the imagination are criminals,'' Kamasaki said.   According to Smith, whose San Antonio district borders Mexico,aliens now account for 20 percent of the federal prison population.   ``If we think the 20 percent figure is high, what's worse isthat seven out of eight (criminal) aliens are either released orgiven probation and never serve time in prison,'' Smith said.   Smith said more than 72,000 aliens will be arrested every yearon drug charges alone. In Texas, the state spends $115,000 to houseapproximately 3,500 alien inmates in its prisons.   ``The problem of aliens who commit serious crimes like murder,rape and drug dealing has escalated, along with expanded drugtrafficking and the number of aliens in the U.S.,'' Smith said.``By any account, the problem of criminal aliens is large andgrowing.''   Apprehensions of criminal aliens _ those referred to INS bylocal law enforcement _ have more than doubled in five years _ from22,000 in fiscal 1985 to 51,154 in 1989.   Deportations of criminal aliens jumped from 4,711 in 1987 to6,072 in 1988 to 41,824 in fiscal 1989, Austin said.   Austin said he agrees the problem of criminal aliens has beenincreasing in recent years. ``It's growing in relation to theillegal flow of aliens into the United States.''   But Kamasaki says the issue tends to be exaggerated andoverstated, ``in the sense that when you consider the total numberof persons coming into the country ... the number of personscommitting a crime in proportion to the 10 million (aliens whoenter annually) is extraordinarily small.''   Kamasaki said politicians can always score quick points bashingcriminals, aliens, or criminal aliens.   ``For a politician on the lookout for a cheap way to score somepolitical points, the subject _ even the title, `criminal aliens,'is like a gold mine. But its really a very minor problem in thecontext of crime overall,'' he said.   And the problem of aliens involved in the drug trade, he said,is more a drug problem than an immigration problem.   ``There does appear to be a large and growing problem ofimportation of drugs from certain countries, but you don't solvethat through immigration law, but with regular law enforcement,''Kamasaki said.</TEXT></DOC>
