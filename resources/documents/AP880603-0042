Officials from the Foreign Ministry also said Thursday thatJapanese Foreign Minister Sosuke Uno is expected to urge Israel towithdraw from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip when he visitsIsrael at the end of June.   Japan plays a small political role in the Middle East but itseconomic role, especially its purchases of oil and its exportationof high-technology equipment, is substantial.   ``Since the Israeli invasion into Lebanon in June 1982, Japanhas consistently called for an unconditional Israeli withdrawalfrom Lebanon,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Koichi Haraguchi told aregular news conference. ``I'd like to take this opportunity (onthe sixth anniversary) to reaffirm that there has been no change inthis policy.''   Referring to Israel's actions against Arab protesters in theoccupied territories, Haraguchi said, ``the current handling of thePalestinian people in those areas is not kindly welcomed and weexpress our hope that the current conduct will be stoppedimmediately.''

He will bethe highest ranking Japanese official ever to visit Israel, theofficials said.   About 200 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank andGaza Strip since the anti-occupation uprising began nearly sixmonths ago.</TEXT></DOC>
