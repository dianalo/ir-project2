Recent directions in statutes establish the trend ofcombining internal and external doses. We are developing a Health PhysicsInformation Management System (HPIMS) that will centralize dosimetrycalculations and data storage; integrate health physics records withother health-related disciplines, such as industrial hygiene, medicine,and safety; provide a more auditable system with published algorithmsand clearly defined flowcharts of system operation; readily facilitatefuture changes dictated by new regulations, new dosimetric models, andnew systems of units; and address ad-hoc inquiries regarding worker/workplaceinteractions, including potential synergisms with non-radiation exposures.The system is modular and provides a high degree of isolation from low-leveldetail, allowing flexibility for changes without adversely affectingother parts of the system. 10 refs., 3 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
