That appraisal, offered to the House Banking Committee byFederal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman L. William Seidman, fallsshort of private analysts' guesses, which range up to $100 billion,but it is nearly twice as high as other official governmentestimates.   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the regulator of the nation's3,100 savings institutions, last month put the price tag at $31billion, within the $26 billion to $36 billion range offered by theGeneral Accounting Office, Congress' auditing arm.   Some in Congress and the Reagan administration dismiss theshifting estimates as a numbers game, but Seidman's estimate islikely to lend new urgency to the debate over whether taxpayers'money is needed to bail out the Federal Savings and Loan InsuranceCorp.   Until now, official estimates have been low enough to support anargument that the FSLIC, which expects to have $42.5 billion inrevenue over the next 10 years, can get by without taxpayer money.   However, if Seidman's $50 billion cost estimate is on target,there is little question that the FSLIC needs more money. Seidmansaid the bank board's revenue projections also ``are on theoptimistic side.''   He added, ``We estimate (the problem) is getting worse atsomething like $1 billion a month.''   Although Seidman's agency insures commercial banks _ not savingsand loan associations _ it is studying the FSLIC's problems becausesome have proposed merging the two insurance funds, a move Seidmanand banks oppose.   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said members of Congress regardbank board estimates as overly optimistic and were likely to givemore credence to Seidman's number.   Seidman said his own agency, which last Friday announcedpotentially the largest bank rescue ever, will suffer its firstloss this year since its founding in 1934.   The FDIC is spending $4 billion to assist the takeover of FirstRepublicBank Corp. of Dallas by NCNB Corp. of Charlotte, N.C.Seidman had said he expected to recover part of that.   On Wednesday, he estimated for the first time a figure for theultimate cost _ $2 billion to $3 billion.   If that proves true, the First RepublicBank rescue would surpassthe 1984 bailout of Continental Illinois Corp. of Chicago. The FDICinitially spent $4.5 billion in that transaction, but expects torecover all but $1.7 billion.   Seidman slightly worsened the projections for the FDIC fund,which ended 1987 with $18.3 billion. Previously, he has said itcould decline by as much as 10 percent.   On Wednesday, he said, ``we'll go down 10, 12, 13 percent'' to``$16 billion, $15.5 billion, something like that.''   He also said that banks closed or requiring FDIC assistance tostay open will surpass last year's post-Depression record of 203.Ninety-eight banks have failed so far this year and 17 othersreceived government assistance.   With the First RepublicBank transaction, eight of the 10 largestbanks in Texas have been recapitalized, either by the government orprivately. For one of the two remaining, ``we may have to provideassistance. We don't know at this time,'' Seidman said.   He declined to identify the institution, but he was believed tobe talking about MCorp., a Dallas bank that has been trying toraise private capital.</TEXT></DOC>
