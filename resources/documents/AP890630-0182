However, the court left intact a permanent injunction on randomdrug testing for Justice Department lawyers responsible forconducting grand jury proceedings and employees who prosecutecriminal cases.   The court suggested that the department consider limiting testingto personnel who handle drug prosecutions.   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said the department wouldconsider seeking further court review of ``parts of the opinion withwhich we disagree'' or to refocus the program.   The department's plans for random drug testing covered about1,300 employees with top-secret clearances, as well as about 400criminal prosecutors and 750 personnel with access to grand juryinformation.   In a decision written by Chief U.S. Circuit Court of AppealsJudge Patricia Wald, the court rejected the department's request tolift the injunction issued by a federal district court last summer.   The injunction resulted from a lawsuit by 38 Justice Departmentattorneys.   Wald said U.S. Supreme Court decisions require the injunction tobe modified to permit testing of employees with top-secretclearances.   The Supreme Court, in a drug-testing case involving the U.S.Customs Service, said the government had a compelling interest inprotecting truly sensitive information.   The department argued that the duties of its workers covered bythe drug-testing plan raised comparable public safety concerns asthose in the Customs Service and on railroads, where drug testinghas been upheld.   ``We do not agree,'' Wald wrote. ``Certainly a blunder by aJustice Department lawyer may lead, through a chain of ensuingcircumstances, to a threat to public safety.   ``That sort of indirect risk, however, is wholly different fromthe risk posed by a worker who carries a gun or operates a train.''   Wald was joined in the opinion by Judge Spottswood Robinson.Judge Laurence Silberman dissented to part of the decision.</TEXT></DOC>
