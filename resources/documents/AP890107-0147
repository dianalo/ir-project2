The Sunday Telegraph said the senior official, who the report didnot name, said information about the deal to sell Mirage jetfighters was compiled with the help of European intelligenceagencies.   The report did not say how many jets were under negotiation.   Navy Lt. Cmdr. James Kudla, a Defense Department spokesman inWashington, said he had not seen the report and could not comment onit.   The newspaper said Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi ``wants toreplenish his stock of aging (Soviet) MiG planes with the latestFrench fighter,'' the Mirage.   It said the French government first sold Libya a version of theMirage in 1978 which was delivered in the early 1980s, althoughLibya now receives most of its military equipment from EasternEurope and the Soviet Union.   ``The United States fears that, if the Libyans had been equippedwith the new Mirage, the fight over the Mediterranean last weekcould have ended differently,'' said the report, referring the U.S.downing of two Libyan planes on Wednesday.   He said the United States had not confronted the French with itsknowledge.</TEXT></DOC>
