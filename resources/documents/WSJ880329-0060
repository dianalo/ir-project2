Though the conferees are likely to adopt the Senate's plant-closing provision, rather than a tougher House version, the move threatens to jeopardize business support for the trade package as well as spark a veto from the president, who specifically criticized that portion of the bill in remarks yesterday.    The notification plan would require employers to tell workers 60 days in advance if plants are to be closed either to consolidate work forces or to relocate.    Congress is trying to move quickly this week to wrap up conference work on the trade legislation. Senate Finance Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, the leading Senate trade negotiator, said that provisions not resolved by the end of this week could be dropped from the bill. Among the provisions that seem to be stalled in conference are those mandating sanctions against Toshiba Corp. of Japan, requiring foreigners to disclose significant U.S. investments, and requiring the administration to negotiate to create an international debt authority.    In a speech to Reynolds Metals Co. workers in Richmond, Va., President Reagan said he will sign the trade bill only if there is a &quot;wholesale elimination of the objectionable provisions.&quot; In addition to complaining about the plant-closing provision, he pointed to the requirement for disclosure by foreign investors and to a section in the bill that would authorize retaliatory action against nations that run trade surpluses with the U.S.    Administration aides have said they worked out a compromise with lawmakers last week to produce an acceptable provision on the foreign investors requirement. But White House aides said that, while the compromise was approved by administration negotiators, it hasn't yet been formally written into the bill. Thus, they said, Mr. Reagan wanted to reaffirm his insistence that the objectionable language be deleted from the final bill.    In his speech, the president complained that &quot;in an apparent attempt to import Euro-malaise,&quot; lawmakers have written into the trade bill &quot;European-style regulations that would create America's first national rules restricting a company's right to close down facilities and relocate operations.&quot;    But Sen. Bentsen (D., Texas) countered, &quot;That's absolutely not true. . . . It only says they should tell the employees.&quot; Referring to the president's warnings, he added, &quot;I don't think these kinds of threats help, frankly.&quot;    The Senate version of the plant-closing provision, while requiring most employers to give 60 days' notice, would exempt &quot;faltering&quot; companies working to avert a closing and would affect only employers with more than 100 employees. It would require employers to give workers back pay for each day of notice not given, to a maximum of 60 days' wages, and to pay the local government where the plant is located a penalty of $500 a day, to a maximum of $30,000.    House conferees probably will offer modifications to these requirements in today's meeting, but the broad outline of the Senate version should remain, congressional sources said. The House version would have required advance notice of as much as 180 days for big companies, and would have called on employers to consult with labor before closing a plant.    Though acceptance of the weaker Senate version probably won't mollify business, it is a move made partly to accommodate those interests. Businesses have complained that notifying employees of impending shutdowns will hasten or add to closings by driving away customers or bringing in creditors. The Senate version wouldn't require advance notification by employers who are seeking new capital or business to avert a shutdown &quot;and who reasonably believe that giving notice will preclude them from maintaining operations.&quot;    The conferees working on the import-relief and export-promotion portions of the bill are scheduled to meet today, but aren't likely to make decisions until tomorrow. One major provision they are expected to drop is the amendment authorizing retaliation against countries running trade surpluses with the U.S. The amendment was sponsored by Rep. Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.), who dropped out of the Democratic presidential race yesterday; the elimination of the provision has been expected for some time.    The conferees are expected instead to work out a compromise provision designed to force countries with large trade surpluses to drop their barriers to U.S. products or face retaliation. </TEXT></DOC>
