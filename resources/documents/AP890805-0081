Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency quoted an unnamed foreignministry official in Tehran as saying, ``The U.S. administrationsent a message to Iran's foreign ministry last week through a thirdcountry. Since the content had nothing to do with Iran, the messagewas not accepted.''   IRNA, monitored in Cyprus, said the official was responding toreports that President Bush had appealed to Iran to prevent thekilling of Western hostages in Lebanon. IRNA gave no furtherdetails.   The Washington Post and several Beirut radio stations reportedtoday that Bush had specifically asked Algeria to intercede after apro-Iranian group said it killed American hostage Lt. Col. WilliamR. Higgins and another group threatened to kill hostage JosephCicippio.   In Washington, U.S. officials sought to downplay any negativeinterpretation of the IRNA report.   ``Basically, we've been trying to get different people to weighin,'' said one closely involved source who spoke on condition ofanonymity. ``We have been able to get our messages, one way oranother, through to the parties _ certainly to the Iranians.''   Meanwhile Marrack Goulding, head of the U.N. peacekeepingoperations, flew to Beirut by helicopter from south Lebanon for athird day of talks with Lebanese leaders and then left for Syria.Goulding is trying to resolve the fate of Higgins and push effortsto set the hostages free.   Before leaving for Syria, Goulding told reporters that Algeria``is playing an extra part in trying to resolve the hostage problemas Algeria has done in previous cases.''   He said he had not yet ``obtained concrete proof that Col.Higgins is dead and I pray he is not dead.''   An extremist Shiite Moslem group calling itself the Organizationof the Oppressed on Earth said it hanged Higgins Monday becauseIsrael refused to free a Moslem cleric it abducted from southLebanon nine days ago. No body ever has been found, and there havebeen reports Higgins died months earlier.   Higgins, 44, a decorated Vietnam war veteran, was head of a76-man observer team attached to the U.N. Peacekeeping force insouth Lebanon known as UNIFIL when he was kidnapped Feb. 17, 1988.   Sixteen Westerners have been held hostage in Lebanon, thelongest nearly 4{ years. Their plight gained renewed internationalattention eight days ago when Israeli commandos kidnapped a ShiiteMoslem cleric with ties to Iran, leading to the threats againstAmerican captives.   Iran's new president, Hashemi Rafsanjani, said Friday that areasonable solution existed to the hostage crisis and that he waswilling to help the United States find it.   ``I tell the White House the problem of Lebanon has solutions,the freeing of the hostages has solutions _ reasonable, prudentsolutions,'' Rafsanjani said in his sermon in Tehran at weeklyMoslem prayers.   His comments appeared to be the strongest indication yet of apossible accommodation between the countries since Islamicfundamentalists ousted the U.S.-backed monarchy in Iran 10{ yearsago.   Algiers Radio said today that progress was made in talks Fridayinvolving Algeria's ambassador in Beirut, Khaled Hasnawi.   Hasnawi said in an interview in today's Washington Post thatAlgeria had assigned an official delegation including politiciansand intelligence specialists to the task of ``getting in touch withthe parties holding captives.''   The radio report said Hasnawi met with the spiritual leader ofHezbollah _ the group believed to be holding Western hostages _Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, and with Goulding.   The talks involved all hostages, whether ``Lebanese,Palestinians, Americans, Europeans or Israelis,'' according to thereport. ``Progress in this mediation was accomplished,'' it addedwithout elaborating.   State Department spokeswoman Nancy Beck said Friday that she wasaware of the report but added, ``I have nothing specific on that.''   Algeria, while proud of its role in mediating past crises,including the 1981 release of American hostages held in the U.S.Embassy in Tehran, usually is close-mouthed about its involvementuntil an issue is settled. The radio report was seen as a sign thatAlgerian authorities think a deal is close.   Today Goulding met with army commander Gen. Michel Aoun, whoheads a Christian military cabinet. He also was to meet with actingPrime Minister Salim Hoss, who heads a Syrian-backed mostly Moslemcabinet vying for legitimacy with Aoun.   The Tehran Times published an interview with the head of theIranian parliament's foreign affairs committee, Said RajaiKhorasani, in which he said he ``deeply regretted'' the killing ofHiggins. But he said Israel was to blame.   The Revolutionary Justice Organization, one of the kidnappinggroups believed to be fronts for Hezbollah, said Thursday it wassuspending its death sentence against Cicippio and replacing itwith demands that Israel free Palestinian and Lebanese prisoners.   In Jerusalem, Israel's top leaders conferred about a response tothe demands, which Revolutionary Justice said must be accepted``within days.'' It did not say what would happen to Cicippio ifIsrael refused. He was kidnapped Sept. 12, 1986.   Hasnaw told the Washington Post that Bush had asked PresidentChadli Benjedid of Algeria to intercede in the Ciccipio case andthat Fadlallah ``deployed great efforts to defer the execution, forwhich he is thanked.''   ``Following contacts begun yesterday with Hezbollah, in the formof pleading and entreaties concerning Cicippio's execution, andafter we strongly condemned the abduction of (the cleric) ... wecounseled patience and self-restraint and called for abstentionfrom dramatic measures and decisions.''   Had Cicippio been killed, there would have been an``explosion,'' the Post quoted Hasnawi as saying.   ``It would have led to a dangerous reaction. America or Israelwould have intervened militarily without anyone knowing the fullscope or nature of such an intervention,'' he said.   Rafsanjani, who was inaugurated Thursday, is believed eager toimprove ties with the West and erase Iran's image as a sponsor ofinternational terrorism.   Israel has offered to trade the cleric and other Shiiteprisoners for three Israeli soldiers held in Lebanon and for theWestern hostages.   Of the 16 Westerners held in Lebanon, eight are Americans. Heldlongest is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent ofThe Associated Press, who was seized March 16, 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
