That rubber-stamped Darren Lewis as theGiants' center fielder and left Bass somewhat upset.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  BASS ON BENCH DESPITE SUCCESS  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Giants Notes  </MEMO><TEXT>     Bass, who had been out about a month before the homestand because of kneeproblems, met with Roger Craig in the manager's office before the opener ofthe eight-game trip.;    &quot;He just said that I wasn't going to play, that as ofnow he doesn't have enough room,&quot; Bass said, stoically. &quot;He said, 'Just bearwith me. I'll try to get you in there.' &quot;;    Asked if he was satisfied withthat, Bass said, &quot;No. I want to play. I finally feel good physically. I knowit showed (in the homestand).;    &quot;You always figured, 'I'm gonna play,' butit's in the back of your mind that you might not. I want to play.&quot;;    Thehot-hand theory will apply to the right-field picture the rest of the way.Mike Felder also was a big contributor in the homestand and is also areserve.;    &quot;Every time you do something like this, things tend to work out,&quot;Craig said. &quot;Willie, who knows how healthy he'll be? And Kevin (Mitchell),with his knee, might need rests. The one thing is, it makes your bench a lotstronger.&quot;;    In other moves:;    (check) Infielders Greg Litton and MikeBenjamin were recalled from Triple-A Phoenix. Both were required to be on thePhoenix roster at least 10 days, so Benjamin can play tonight and Litton canplay Sunday. Pitcher Don Robinson will be activated from the D.L. on Sunday,and an infielder, probably Tony Perezchica, is expected to be sent down.;   (check) Reserve outfielder Mike Kingery will either clear waivers today or beclaimed by another team. Assistant General Manager Ralph Nelson confirmed thatKingery was placed on irrevocable waivers Tuesday.;    The Giants probablywill offer Kingery to Phoenix if he clears waivers, in which case thefive-year man could accept, or he could refuse and become a free agent,receiving his full 1991 salary.;  ETC.: Third baseman Matt Williams, thehottest player during the winning streak, left Thursday's game after fiveinnings because of severe muscle spasms in his lower back. Williams said heexpects to play tonight unless the spasms resurface in batting practice. . . .The Giants signed former Cal pitcher David Masters to a Triple-A contract, andconsidering that he throws a consistent 95-mph fastball, there is a fairchance he will be among the September call-ups. . . . Reds outfielder EricDavis will be out of the lineup at least several more days because of&quot;tightness in his lower back and a general feeling of weakness,&quot; the clubannounced before the game.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  MARK NEWMAN, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Cincinnati  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910802  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  5D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  492  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday August 2, 199100215115,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
