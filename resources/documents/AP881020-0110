The storm, which was moving west after leaving 35 people dead ormissing in Colombia and thousands homeless, stalled this morningover the ocean, but heavy rains associated with the storm lashedCosta Rica.   Gilbert Clark, meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center inCoral Gables, Fla., said flash floods and mud slides could causesevere damage in the mountainous regions of Central America.   ``Unfortunately, they are getting a lot of rain ahead of thisstorm, which is going to affect the area and cause a lot of mudslides and flash flood in the mountains,'' he said. ``The biggestthreat to life will be from flash floods and mud slides.''   Max Mayfield, another forecaster at the hurricane center, saidthe portion of the Caribbean where the hurricane is bound has neverexperienced a storm of such magnitude.   At 9 a.m. EDT, Joan's center was located near latitude 11.2north, longitude 79.7 west, or about 265 miles southeast ofBluefields, Nicaragua. The hurricane was stationary this morningbut was expected to resume a slow westward motion later today.   Maximum sustained winds were 115 mph.   The Colombian islands of San Andres, Albuquerque and Providenciawere under a hurricane warning, and a watch was posted for theCaribbean coasts of Nicaragua and Costa Rica.   A nationwide state of alert was declared in Nicaragua, andschools were closed across the country. Early today, about 5,000people were evacuated from remote coastal regions, said InformationMinister Manuel Espinoza.   At least 12,000 people fled Puerto Limon, Costa Rica's mainCaribbean port, and other northeast coastal towns, said JohnnyAlfaro, national emergency committee director in Puerto Limon.   ``We're sure of one thing: Hurricane Joan will provoke manyfloods along the Atlantic coast and to a lesser degree on thePacific coast,'' Alfaro said.   Hundreds of people lined up for buses to flee the town of 10,000located 100 miles southeast of San Jose, the capital. Some saidthey were afraid there wouldn't be enough transportation foreveryone.   ``We could die,'' said Alfaro Valverde, 58, as he waited in line.   Public Security Minister Hernan Garron said 1,000 police weresent to Puerto Limon to prevent looting.   In Nicaragua, President Daniel Ortega declared a state of alertWednesday night.   ``If the hurricane fully strikes national territory it couldcause severe damages,'' Agriculture Minister Jaime Wheelock toldThe Associated Press.   ``Our priority is to save lives,'' he said. ``We're prepared forwar, but not against hurricanes.''   Civil Defense officials in Nicaragua said that they had enoughemergency supplies only for ``immediate needs.'' They said the7-year war with the U.S.-backed rebels known as Contras has drainedtheir reserves.   State-run Voice of Nicaragua radio set up a new channel for newson the hurricane so it could broadcast Wednesday night's WorldSeries game between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the OaklandAthletics.   ``If the hurricane stays over water, it is possible its fullforce will hit Bluefields Thursday morning or Friday morning. Itcould be a disaster because most of the buildings there are ofwood,'' said Alejo Moreno, head of the Nicaraguan weather service.   Bluefields is on a remote stretch of the Miskito Coast about 180miles east of Managua, the capital.   Joan swept across Colombia's Guajira Peninsula as a tropicalstorm Monday and became a hurricane Tuesday. It killed 15, left 20missing, injured 50 and flooded or destroyed the homes of 27,000people, Colombia's National Emergency Committee said Wednesday.   Joan is the fifth hurricane of the Atlantic season. InSeptember, Hurricane Gilbert left more than 300 people dead andcaused widespread damage in Mexico, Jamaica, Haiti, the DominicanRepublic and the Cayman Islands.</TEXT></DOC>
