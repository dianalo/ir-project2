The light output of doped BaF{sub 2}samples was measured with a solar blind (CsTe) photomultiplier tube andcompared with a standard bialkali phototube. For dopants showing strongslow component suppression, measurements were also made at elevated temperaturesand indicate that additional suppression can be achieved by heating.Radiation damage was studied by measuring the light transmission before,during and after irradiation with {sup 60}Co gamma rays for doses greaterthan 10{sup 6} rad. The results show that several dopants suppress theslow component, but only one, namely lanthanum, preserves the radiationhardness of undoped BaF{sub 2}. 22 refs., 9 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
