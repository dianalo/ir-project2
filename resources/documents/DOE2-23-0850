In all patients, SPECT revealed either multipleor focal uptake defects, the latter corresponding with focal signs orsymptoms in all but one case. Computerized tomography showed a diffusecerebral atrophy in eight of 12 patients, magnetic resonance imagingexhibited changes like atrophy and/or leukoencephalopathy in two of fivecases. Our data indicate that both disturbance of cerebral amine metabolismand alteration of local perfusion share in the pathogenesis of AIDS dementiacomplex. SPECT is an important aid in the diagnosis of AIDS dementiacomplex and contributes to the understanding of the pathophysiologicalmechanisms of this disorder.</TEXT></DOC>
