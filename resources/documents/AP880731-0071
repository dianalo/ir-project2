The Dallas Morning News, which tracked federal spending forfiscal years 1986 and 1987 through 50 states and 3,041 counties,reported Sunday that Tarrant County achieved its top rankingprimarily through the awarding of multibillion-dollar defensecontracts.   The federal government spent more than $5.5 billion, or $5,481per person, in Tarrant County in 1986. The next year, amid a steepdecline in defense spending, the county dropped to the No. 4 percapita position with $4.4 billion, or $4,030 per person, accordingto the newspaper's analysis.   Tarrant County's 1986-87 total was $9.9 billion, or $9,511 percapita. The average U.S. county studied received a two-year totalof $3,577 per person for 1986 and 1987.   Wright district includes most of Fort Worth and the suburbancities in northwestern Tarrant County. He has represented thedistrict for more than three decades, and the county's high rankingin part is a reflection of Wright's increasing influence in how taxdollars are spent.   Wright is unopposed for re-election this year but faces aninvestigation by the House ethics committee into allegations thathe improperly interceded on behalf of troubled savings and loanexecutives in Texas and that he wrongly profited from royalties ona book.   Wright's critics say the spending ranking only reinforcesWright's image as a provincial, pork-barrel politician.   ``Jim Wright generates more pork than is hanging in a Kansasslaughterhouse,'' said Don McNiel, the Alvarado, Texas, Republicanwho tried to unseat Wright in 1986. ``It's the pork barrel capitalof America.''   ``Pork barrel is an abused and grotesquely overused word,''Wright said in response. ``I think it's a sloppy word usedindiscriminately to belittle projects that one doesn't understandand from which one doesn't benefit.''   Military spending makes up the greatest slice of TarrantCounty's federal pie, with 83 percent of the $9.9 billion in fundsreceived coming from defense contracts. The bulk of TarrantCounty's $8.2 billion in defense contracts went to GeneralDynamics, maker of the F-16 jet fighter and the county's largestemployer with 28,000 workers.   The newspaper's analysis of federal spending in fiscal 1986 and1987 used the Census Bureau's Consolidated Federal Funds Report,which tracks federal spending through 50 states, 3,041 counties andmore than 80,000 local governments.   Some federal defense funds traced to a particular county laterare funneled to subcontractors in other counties, making itdifficult to determine how much money a specific county keeps.</TEXT></DOC>
