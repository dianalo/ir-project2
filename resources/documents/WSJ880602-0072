The move, which the company said is &quot;designed to make the company more responsive to the marketplace,&quot; does away with the two major divisions of Nabisco Brands and makes them into free-standing operating companies. The biscuit division, which makes cookies and crackers, becomes Nabisco Biscuit Co., and the grocery products division, which makes cereals, margarines and assorted other foods, becomes Nabisco Foods Co.    Nabisco Brands is to become a holding company, with its corporate staff of 2,000 slashed to about 400 by the end of this year. The &quot;vast majority&quot; of employees losing those jobs will be assigned to the operating companies, according to RJR, which said it didn't yet know if any layoffs would be necessary.    The move continues a management decentralization trend by RJR, which last year cut its corporate headquarters staff to 350 people from about 1,000. It is also designed to improve Nabisco's response time in the increasingly competitive food business. &quot;Corporate staffs develop a life of their own and a mission of their own, and that can be inconsistent with the needs of the operating companies,&quot; said H. John Greeniaus, president and chief executive officer of Nabisco Brands.    The reorganization also prompted some reassignments of top executives of this unit. Peter N. Rogers, Nabisco Brands' executive vice president, was named chairman and chief executive officer of the newly created Nabisco Biscuit Co. William B. McKnight, who had been president of the biscuit division, was appointed president and chief executive officer of the newly created Nabisco Foods Co. Ellen R. Marram, who had been president of the grocery products division, was named president of Nabisco Biscuit Co., reporting to Mr. Rogers.    The biscuit business, which markets such leading cookie and cracker brands as Oreo and Ritz, is the bigger of the newly created operating companies, with 1987 sales of about $2 billion. The grocery products division has been a catch-all of many other Nabisco brands, including Shredded Wheat and Fleischmann's margarines. It had 1987 sales of about $1.2 billion. RJR, which in addition to food produces tobacco, doesn't disclose the respective businesses' profitability.    Though a major power in the food industry, Nabisco isn't seen as a leading innovator or fast mover, and Mr. Greeniaus acknowledged shortcomings. &quot;We were increasingly tying up people as coordinators and administrators, nothing more than go-betweens,&quot; he said. &quot;What we're interested in doing is stripping out that messenger process.&quot;    Change is particularly imperative, according to Mr. Greeniaus, as Nabisco launches an ambitious $4 billion capital spending program to modernize its bakeries. Hundreds of research-and-development scientists who had been on the corporate staff will be reassigned to the new biscuit company, which he feels will better focus their efforts for that business.    But how this will all work in practice remains to be seen, since Nabisco has previously reorganized itself in a number of other ways in recent years. For instance, it restructured its Del Monte Foods business several times over, before that unit was finally split off into a separate operating company several weeks ago. RJR acknowledged at the time that the combination of Nabisco and Del Monte, with its business mix of fresh fruits and canned fruits and vegetables, hadn't worked.    Nabisco's two international operating companies -- International Nabisco Brands Inc. and Nabisco Brands Ltd. (Canada) -- are relatively unaffected by the new corporate structure, according to RJR. </TEXT></DOC>
