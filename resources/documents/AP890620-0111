Its developers say the machine, though still primitive, is themost promising aid for the blind since the introduction of Braille160 years ago..   The Personal Companion, unveiled at a news conference, wascreated for the 6.5 million Americans who cannot see well enough toread or are so handicapped they can't turn a page or punch akeyboard.   The machine has the appearance of a computer, but without akeyboard. It is programmed to respond to the voice of its user.   Transceptor Technologies Inc., an Ann Arbor, Mich., companyfounded in 1986 by people with backgrounds in medicine, visualrehabilitation, telecommunications, computer design and education,developed the Personal Companion.   Argyropoulos, a 22-year-old computer buff, designed the softwear,working 20 hours to 80 hours a week while a student at theUniversity of Michigan.   He said he wanted to build a machine ``not for the superstarblind person but one that your grandmother could use without knowinganything about computers.''   Argyropoulos said 20 minutes of training by the machine, whichgives instructions by voice, are all that's needed to get started.   Company president Bernard F. McCrory said the machine costs$6,500 to $6,800. The higher priced model comes with a screen forthe visually impaired on which the type can be made several incheshigh.   McCrory said the machine could be leased by those who can'tafford to buy one.   Carroll Jackson, director of the Greater Detroit Society for theBlind and a consultant to the company, called the development``analogous to the introduction of Braille'' by blind FrenchmanLouis Braille in 1829.   Jackson, who is legally blind, compared its potential impact tothe introduction of curb cuts that enable people in wheelchairs touse sidewalks.   In the voice demonstration, Argyropoulos had the machine domathematical computations, record a checkbook transaction _ but notactually write the check _ tell what was in his appointment ledgerand turn on the radio and the lights.   At his command, the device called information to get and record aphone number and then dialed the number.   By arrangement with the Gannett Co., a condensed version of USAToday is made available each day over a telephone line. Themachine's synthetic, mechanical sounding voice lists the sections ofthe newspaper, recites the headlines and reads abbreviated versionsof stories selected by the user.   Ultimately, McCrory said, far more information will be availablefrom computer data banks and the machine will play compact discs,each capable of reading aloud up to 50 books.   Company founder Mark Blumenkranz, an ophthalmologist and surgeonat the Kresge Eye Institute in Detroit, said an engineer who losthis sight in a hunting accident five years ago consequently lost hisbusiness.   The engineer has been testing the machine and ``feels he will beable to go back into business for himself,'' Blumenkranz said.</TEXT></DOC>
