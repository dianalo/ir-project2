Sources said the proposal would raise OPEC's production by 1.5million barrels to 22 million barrels a day and allow the UnitedArab Emirates to continue producing as it pleases.   Venezuela and Indonesia would give up part of their share tomeet Kuwait's demands for a bigger portion, while other countries'percentages would remain the same, the sources said.   Iranian oil minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh said during a breakfrom talks at OPEC's regular winter conference that the ministerswere discussing a new idea, but he declined to elaborate.   ``I think the atmosphere is good,'' Aqazadeh said.   Indonesian oil minister Ginandjar Kartasasmita said: ``Ideas aregetting closer.''   Saudi Arabia's influential oil minister, Hisham Nazer said, ``Wewill be continuing to meet.''   The oil markets decided to reserve judgment, analysts said.   The spot price for North Sea Brent Blend, the most widely tradedinternational crude oil, was $18.44 a barrel Monday afternoon,unchanged from late Friday. West Texas Intermediate, the benchmarkgrade of U.S. crude, was down sharply in late afternoon tradingwith the near-term contract at $19.63 a barrel, down 19 cents fromFriday. But analysts said the weakness was not necessarilyOPEC-related.   ``Traders on the whole have become more circumspect about anearly analysis of OPEC trends, having been caught too many times bythe whipsaw of seemingly contradictory statements by oilministers,'' said Peter Gignoux who heads Shearson Lehman Hutton'sinternational energy desk in London.   Most of the 13 ministers of the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries met in a hotel room for several hours on Mondayto see if they could resolve their differences. They also met insmaller groups during the day.   The ministers gathered on Saturday for the opening of theconference and then met informally on Sunday, part of their normalstrategy for establishing common ground.   OPEC has been grappling with demands from Kuwait and the UnitedArab Emirates for larger shares of the group's total output.   Most of the ministers seem to agree that OPEC's current ceilingof 20.5 million barrels a day could be raised, since it would morerealistically reflect the group's actual output. However, there aredisputes about how large an increase there should be and how theextra output should be divided.   Analysts estimate that OPEC actually is producing more than 23million barrels a day. Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates each arepumping double their quotas of 1.1 million barrels a day to presstheir demands for a higher share of the total.   The United Arab Emirates would be excluded from the deal nowunder consideration and would continue to produce what it wants,sources said.   Prices have held at levels about 50 percent higher than a yearago, despite the increased supply, thanks to strong world demandand lower production by non-OPEC oil producers.   Strong demand coupled with the fact that some members areproducing at near capacity anyway, has eased the pressure for OPECto solve its differences on quota allocations.   If the ministers fail to take advantage of this absence ofcrisis to work out their problems, their choices are: striking adeal that isn't unanimous; giving all members an equal increase; orsimply rolling over their current agreement.   But these choices would only postpone a solution to cheating byOPEC members and the oil markets likely would view any one of themas a sign of weakness.   Such a market reaction, combined with the traditional slump inoil demand during the spring, could deeply depress prices.</TEXT></DOC>
