GERANIOS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>RICHLAND, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The world's first full-sized nuclearreactor is eligible to become a national historic site, but somepeople wonder if a device that helped kill 40,000 Japanese in WorldWar II should bememorialized at all.   ``I believe it has a great deal of historical significance,''said Bill Heine, manager of the Hanford restoration project forWestinghouse Hanford Co. ``Anyone in the nuclear industry wouldagree to that.''   There is little question that the crash construction of the BReactor during the Manhattan Project was an engineering marvel. Itproduced plutonium for the atomic bomb that destroyed Nagasaki onAug. 9, 1945. The bomb that fell on Hiroshima three days earlierwas powered by uranium from Oak Ridge, Tenn.   ``Historians disagree on the importance of the atomic bomb inbringing an end to the war,'' said Lindy Cater of the HanfordEducation Action League, a Spokane-based citizens' watchdog group.   ``Different people have different points of view about theparticipation of Hanford and what resulted in many deaths atNagasaki.''   B Reactor has been ruled eligible for inclusion on the NationalRegister of Historic Places, but no nomination has been made.   What brings the issue to the forefront now is a newly releaseddraft environmental impact statement on what to do with eightclosed reactors along the Columbia River that produced plutoniumfor nuclear weapons. Options range from dismantling them to buryingthem where they are under huge mounds of dirt.   The Department of Energy has scheduled public hearings this yearin Portland, Ore., Richland, Spokane and Seattle. The departmenthas set a July 28 deadline for comments, but has no specific datefor a final report.   As an historic site, the reactor would boost tourism, said DaveHansen of the Washington Department of Community Development.``Naturally our position would favor its retention. It's a veryearly example of atomic technology.''   Memorials to war are not uncommon.   The Enola Gay, the B-29 that dropped the Hiroshima bomb, isstored at the Smithsonian Institution.   Bock's Car, which dropped B Reactor's plutonium on Nagasaki, ison display at the Air Force Museum at Wright-Patterson Air ForceBase in Dayton, Ohio.   Battlefields around the world where thousands died are nowmemorials.   But none of those memorials are classified as radioactive waste,as the B Reactor is. And while current generations face littledanger from the Enola Gay or Antietam National Battlefield, BReactor plutonium still arms warheads.   B Reactor has the most historical significance of those on theHanford nuclear reservation, and in 1976 was designated a NationalHistoric Mechanical Engineering Landmark by the American Society ofMechanical Engineers.   It was the first full-sized nuclear reactor in the world, withconstruction beginning a few months after physicist Enrico Fermiachieved the world's first nuclear chain reaction at the Universityof Chicago.   It was built by 55,000 workers during a fevered 15 months endingSept. 26, 1944, as the nation was racing Nazi Germany to build anatom bomb.   Today, the control room and the adjacent room where Fermi workedare still intact. The walls are painted a government green, thereactor dials are still, and a well-worn operators' manual sits ona desk. While the reactor vessel is classified as low-level nuclearwaste and must be disposed of, no measureable radiation is emittedinto the visitor areas, Hanford officials say.   Although Hanford is still a heavily guarded plutonium productionsite, the B Reactor is only a mile from the public-access StateHighway 240. A road could be built to the reactor, with the areabehind it fenced off, officials say.   Already there are some displays showing photos of the history ofthe reactor, along with pioneering tools and the giant exposed faceof the reactor, where the nuclear fuel rods were inserted.   Only about 200 people per year tour the reactor now, accordingto DOE spokesman Tom Bauman, who said the agency isn't sure howmuch controversy might develop and are waiting to see the resultsof the public hearings.   U.S. Rep. Sid Morrison, R-Wash., who represents Hanford, saidhe, too, isn't sure of the public response. ``It's important for anumber of us to try and sort out how important B Reactor is tohistory.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for PMs, May 29</NOTE></DOC>
