Introduction </ITAG>The Board has had under review for some time the legal and policy issuesassociated with the application of the nonbanking provisions of section4 of the Bank Holding Company Act (``BHC Act'') to subsidiaries of holdingcompany banks. In light of a number of developments, including the enactmentof the insurance amendments to section 4(c)(8) of the Act, the expansionof the powers authorized for subsidiaries of state banks under a numberof state statutes, petitions and requests for rulemaking by a number ofparties regarding the coverage of these subsidiaries under the Act, andthe recent decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of ColumbiaCircuit in <T3>AMBAC,</T3>\1\<NOTE/> the Board has decided that it is now appropriate to resolvethese issues. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ <T3>American Insurance Association </T3>v. <T3>Clarke, </T3>854 F. 2d 1405 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (``<T3>AMBAC</T3>''), <T3>rehearing granted</T3>, October 24, 1988.Accordingly, after reexamining the governing provisions of the Act, theBoard has decided to ask for public comment on a proposal that would rescinedits existing regulation that permits state banks owned by bank holdingcompanies to acquire, without approval under the Bank Holding Company Act,so-called operations subsidiaries_companies that are wholly-owned by thestate bank and that engage only in activities that the bank may conductdirectly under state law.\2\<NOTE/> The result of this proposed amendment would be to requirebank holding companies to obtain approval under the closely related tobanking standards of section 4(c)(8) of the Act for their subsidiary statebanks to acquire or retain control of such operations subsidiaries or theirvoting shares, unless control of the subsidiary is permitted without anapplication under one of the other limited exemptions in the Act (<T3>e.g., </T3>for servicing activities (12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(1)). The proposalwould provide grandfather rights for certain existing operations subsidiariesand establish expedited notice procedures for future acquisitions of operationssubsidiaries by holding company state banks. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ 12 CFR 225.22(d)(2)(ii). As discussed below, the Boarddoes not propose to rescind or alter its current rule permitting statebanks owned by bank holding companies to aquire shares of the kinds andamounts explicitly eligible by federal statute for investment by a nationalbank. 12 CFR 225.22(d)(2)(i). The Board's state bank operations subsidiary rule, which was adopted in1971, provides that state banks owned by bank holding companies may, withoutBoard approval under the Act, acquire or retain all of the voting sharesof companies that engage solely in activities that the bank may conductdirectly under applicable state law, at locations at which the bank mayconduct the activity and subject to other limitations that would be applicableif the bank were conducting the activity.\3\<NOTE/> The Board has a similar rule for operations subsidiariesof national banks authorized in accordance with regulations of the Comptrollerof the Currency.\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ 12 CFR 225.22(d)(2)(ii). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ 12 CFR 225.22(d)(1). As discussed below, the Board isnot proposing any action regarding this regulations pending the decisionof the Court in <T3>AMBAC</T3>.   In adopting these rules in 1971, the Board noted that it did so based uponnotions of competitive equity between independent banks and holding companybanks and in the absence of evidence that acquisitions by holding companybanks were resulting in evasions of the Act. 36 FR 9292 (1971).\5\<NOTE/> At that time, the powers of operations subsidiaries of bankswere limited and approval for operations subsidiaries was required by thebanking authorities. Thus, there was no significant conflict between thescope of activities permitted for bank holding companies and their directand indirect nonbank subsidiaries under the closely related to bankingand proper incident standards of section 4(c)(8) of the Act and the Board'srules. The Board, however, recognized that over time these rules couldbecome the focus for evasion of section 4(c)(8) of the Act and cautionedthat it would review the merits of its decisions not to apply the Act tothese subsidiaries from time to time based upon its experience in administeringthe Act. <T3>Id. </T3><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ At year-end 1971, bank holding companies controlled 2,420banks, or approximately 18 percent of the total banks in the United States.These banks held approximately 57 percent of the total assets in commercialbanks in the country. By year-end 1987, bank holding companies controlled9,316 banks with 92 percent of assets in commercial banks. In 1982, Congress amended section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act to provide that,with certain exceptions, insurance activities are not closely related tobanking, thereby eliminating the Board's discretion to permit bank holdingcompanies to engage in these activities.\6\<NOTE/> This amendment raised the question of the continued appropriatenessof the Board's operations subsidiaries rules because, for the first time,these rules potentially permit nonbank subsidiaries of holding companiesto engage in activities that the Board had no discretion to permit forbank holding companies and their direct and indirect nonbank subsidiaries.In addition, in connection with its 1983 update and revision of RegulationY, the Board received substantial comment that these rules were not consistentwith the terms and intent of the BHC Act because they permitted holdingcompanies to acquire, through subsidiary banks, companies engaged in activitiesnot permissible under the Act. The Board has also become concerned thatthe risk nonbanking activities in subsidiaries of banks outside the frameworkand safeguards Congress established in the BHC Act for the conduct of nonbankingactivities within a bank holding company organization.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ Garn-St Germain Depositiory Institutions Act of 1982,Pub. L. 97-320, Title VI, 96 Stat. 1469, 1536-1538 (1982).For these reasons, the Board deferred final action on the operations subsidiaryrules in its 1983 Regulation Y rulemaking pending completion of certainrelated proceedings involving the insurance and real estate investmentand development powers of bank holding companies and consideration by Congressof the appropriateness of expanded powers for banking organizations andthe structural arrangements and prudential limitations that should governthe exercise of these powers.\7\<NOTE/> The recent decision by the Court of Appeals in AMBAC thata holding company national bank may not acquire an operations subsidiarywithout compliance with section 4(c)(8) of the BHC Act has focused theBoard's attention on the need to resolve the issues raised by these rules.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ 49 FR 794, 797, 811 (1984); 52 FR 543, 545 (1987).A. Acquisitionof Voting Shares and Subsidiaries by Holding Company State Banks Underthe Nonbanking Porvisions of the Bank Holding Company ActIn light of the above developments, the Board has reexamined the legalbasis for the state bank operations subsidiary rule, including, particularly,the scope of coverage of the nonbanking provisions of section 4(a) of theact as they apply to subsidiaries of holding company banks, and the existenceof any provisions in the Act that would permit acquisitions of operationssubsidiaries without section 4(c)(8) approval. Based upon that reexaminationand in light of judicial decisions regarding the Board's discretionaryauthority under the Act, the Board is concerned that the current statebank opeations subsidiary rule may not be consistent with the terms ofthe Act. Accordingly, the Board is proposing to rescind this rule and isrequesting public comment on the proposal.Since enactment of the Act in 1956, the Board has consistently held thatthe nonbanking provisions of section 4(a) of the Act apply to the acquisitionand retention of the voting shares of nonbank companies by holding companybanks because such shares are deemed indirectly held by the parent holdingcompany under the Act. <T3>See e.g. </T3>12 CFR 225.101 and 102. As discussed in Part III, theliteral language of the Act leaves no room for doubt as to the correctnessof this position.\8\<NOTE/> The overall structure of the Act, reflecting the line drawnby Congress in the Act between banking and nonbanking companies, and itslegislative history and itnent support this position.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ Under section 4(a) of the Act, a bank holding companymany not acquire or retain direct or indirect control of the voting sharesof any company other than a bank and may not control any subsidiary otherthan banks and other subsidiaries authorized under the Act. 12 U.S.C. 1843(a).Under the Act's definitions, a subsidiary of a holding company bank isdeemed to be an indirect subsidiary of the holding company and its sharesare deemed to be indirectly held by the holding company. 12 U.S.C. 1841(g)(1).Accordingly, the Board believes that when a bank controlled by a bank holdingcompany seeks to acquire or retain control of a nonbank company or itsvoting shares, that transaction is subject to the nonbanking provisionsof section 4(a) of the BHC Act and, to be permissible, must fall withinone of the exemptions to these prohibitions.There is no express exemption in the Act that permits a state bank ownedby a bank holding company, without compliance with section 4(c)(8), toacquire or retain control of a company engaged in any activity that maybe authorized for the bank under state law or of the voting shares of sucha company; and the Board cited no such exemption when the rule was adoptedin 1971. Moreover, in light of judicial decisions since the operationssubsidiary rules were adopted in 1971 concerning the scope of the Board'sauthority under the Act,\9\<NOTE/> the Board does nto believe that it is authorized under theAct, as a matter of regualtory discretion or forbearance, to provide aregulatory exemption permitting such acquisitions without compliance withthe closely related to banking and public interest standards and proceduralrequirements of section 4(c)(8).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ <T3>See, e.g., Board of governors of the Federal Reserve System </T3>v.<T3>Dimension financial Corp., </T3>474 U.S. 361, 368 (1986) (if the languageof the BHC Act ``is clear and unambiguous, `that is the end of the matter,for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguouslyexpressed intent of Congress' '', quoting <T3>Chevron U.S.A., Inc., </T3>v. <T3>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </T3>467 U.S. 837, 842-843(1984).For the foregoing reasons, the Board is asking for comment on a proposalto rescind the state bank operations subsidiary rule (12 CFR 225.22(d)(2)(ii)),thereby requiring that the acquisition and retention of operations subsidiariesand their voting shares meet the closely related to banking and properincident standards of section 4(c)(8) of the Act (unless the transactionfits under any of the other limited exemptions in the Board's RegulationY).B. Consistency of Proposal With Dual Banking System Principles The Board wishes to emphasize that the principles of the dual banking systemas reflected in the terms and legislative intent of the BHC Act would beunaffected by application of the Act to operations subsidiaries of holdingcompany state banks. In the 1956 Act, Congress recognized these principlesby limiting the coverage of the nonbanking provisions of the Act to bankholding companies and their direct and indirect nonbank subsidiaries. Theappropriate range of activities for state and national banks, which areauthorized, respectively, by the states and the Comptroller, was deliberatelyleft unaffected by the prudential limitations established under section4(c)(8) of the BHC Act. The Board has adhered to this view of the linedrawn by Congress in section 4 of the Act between banks and nonbankingcompanies since its enactment in 1956, and has recently reaffirmed thatposition. See <T3>Merchants National Corporation,</T3> 73 Federal Reserve Bulletin 876,878-80 (1987).\1\\0\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\ <T3>vacated on other grounds sub nom. Independent Ins. Agents of America</T3>v. <T3>Board of Governors, </T3> 838 F.2d 627 (2d Cir. 1988).Because the nonbanking provisions of the Act apply only to holding companiesand their nonbank subsidiaries, the direct activities of state and nationalbanks and the actions of regulatory and state legislative bodies as theyapply to the direct activities of banks are entirely unaffected by section4 of the BHC Act. Thus, a decision that section 4 of the BHC Act appliesto nonbank subsidiaries of holding company state banks does not limit theauthority of states to determine the appropriate range of activities forbanks, whether or not owned by holding companies, and does not upset theprinciples of the dual banking system. C. Impact of the Decision on Operations Subsidiaries of State Banks Similarly, the Board does not believe that a decision to rescind the statebank operations subsidiary rule would unduly disrupt existing relationshipsor result in substantial new regulatory burdens. For example, the Board'sproposal to eliminate the state bank operations subsidiary rule does notmean that it would be unlawful for state banks in a holding company systemto establish operations subsidiaries or that their activities must be terminatedor moved into the bank. In this regard, the Board notes that most of the activities permitted forstate banks are also permissible for bank holding companies under the BHCAct and that many bank holding companies already have approval to engagein the activities on the Regulation Y list directly and through their subsidiaries,including operations subsidiaries. Moreover, as discussed in Part II, theBoard would emphasize that the proposal to rescind its state bank operationssubsidiary rule gives appropriate consideration to grandfathering acquisitionsby banks in reliance on the Board's current regulation. In those cases where BHC Act approval has not been secured, the Board isproposing rules that would permit approval under an expedited notice procedure.The procedure would give full consideration to the authorizing actionsof state bank regulatory authorities and would allow holding companiesbanks to proceed to acquire operations subsidiaries engaged in activitieslisted in Regulation Y unless notified within a short period of time thatthe activity of the subsidiary was inconsistent with the safety and soundnessand other prudential provisions of section 4(c)(8) of the Act. D. Implications for Bank Regulation Application of the BHC Act to holding company state bank operations subsidiarieswould further a fundamental policy objective of bank regulation in thepowers area. The Board has taken the position that it is necessary to expandthe activities in which banking organizations may engage, particularlyin the securities area, in order to assure their competitive vitality ina rapidly changing financial environment. To accomplish this objectivethe Board has considered it essential that these activities take placein a subsidiary of a holding company rather than in a holding company bankor in a subsidiary of a bank. The purpose of this organizational structure is to separate more effectivelythan through other available techniques these new functions from the benefitsof the federal safety net, which consists of access to Federal Reservecredit and federal deposit insurance. This separation is required for tworeasons: (1) To assure that the risks of these activities are not passedon to the federal safety net, and (2) to assure that competition is notdistorted by the support for depository institutions that is an aspectof the federal safety net. Application of the Act to holding company state bank subsidiaries wouldhelp to accomplish these goals by assuring that activities that pose arisk to the federal safety net will be conducted in entities that are muchmore effectively insulated from their bank affiliates. The Board is sensitiveto the concern that these goals might be achieved only as a result of additionalregulatory burdens and at the cost of limiting the scope of initiativeat the state level. The Board believes, however, that effective and flexibleadministration of the BHC Act, such as through the options discussed inPart II, will allow these goals to be accomplished without imposing substantialnew regulatory burdens, or unduly limiting the initiative of state authoritiesto adapt banking powers to market realities. E. Applicability of Section 4(c)(5) of the Act to Permit Acquisition ofShares by Holding Company State Banks.The Board notes that section 4(c)(5) of the Act also does not by its termsauthorize the acquisition of operations subsidiaries by holding companystate banks. Under section 4(c)(5), a holding company may acquire, withoutan application or compliance with the prudential safeguards of section4(c)(8) of the Act, ``shares which are the kinds and amounts eligible forinvestment by national banking associations under the provisions of section5136 of the Revised Statutes''. 12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(5). It is clear thatsection 4(c)(5) does not authorize bank holding companies or their subsidiariesto make either direct or indirect investments that may be permissible forstate banks under state law. As noted above, there is no other provisionin the BHC Act that would have this effect for state bank acquisitions.The Board has interpreted section 4(c)(5) as permitting holding companystate banks to acquire shares of companies only of the kinds and in theamounts listed or cross-referenced in section 5136 of the Revised Statutesas eligible for investment for national banks.\1\\1\<NOTE/> The Board continues to believe that this section of its rulesis fully consistent with the terms of the Act, and thus is proposing toreadopt this rule.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\1\ 12 CFR 225.22(d)(2)(i). The voting shares which arelisted as eligible for investment under section 5136 include those of bankers'banks and bankers' bank holding companies up to 10 percent of capital andsurplus, agricultural credit companies up to 20 percent of capital andsurplus, and safe-deposit companies up to 15 percent of capital and surplus.Section 5136 also cross-references investments in stock specifically authorizedunder other statutes, which also are limited in amount. <T3>E.g., </T3>shares of Edge Act and Agreement Corporations up to 10%of capital and surplus, (12 U.S.C. 601, 618), small business investmentcompanies up to 5% of capital and surplus, (15 U.S.C. 681), and bank servicecorporations up to 10% of capital and surplus (12 U.S.C. 1862).This existing rule is also consistent with the Board's rules implementingsection 4(c)(5) as they apply to the acquisition of shares by bank holdingcompanies directly and by their direct nonbank subsidiaries. 12 CFR 225.22(c)(4).In 1971, at the time it adopted the state bank operations subsidiary rule,the Board also adopted rules implementing section 4(c)((5) that providethat a bank holding company and its nonbank subsidiaries may acquire votingshares under section 4(c)(5), but <T3>only </T3>if the shares were of the limited range explicitly eligibleby federal statute for investment by a national bank.\1\\2\<NOTE/> At that time, the Board recognized that if section 4(c)(5)is deemed to go beyond the limited range of shares authorized by statutefor national banks to invest in, the carefully established Congressionalframework in section 4(c)(8) for authorization of the activities of holdingcompanies and their nonbank subsidiaries would be upset.\1\\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\2\ 12 CFR 225.22(c)(4).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\3\ The Board stated that unless section 4(c)(5) were sointerpreted ``Congress' purpose in amending section 4(c)(8) might be substantiallynullified.'' 36 FR 1430, 1431; <T3>see id. </T3>at 9292 (1971). In its 1984 rulemaking regarding section4(c)(5), the Board reaffirmed this view, a view that has been acceptedby the banking industry, insofar as the bank holding companies themselvesare concerned, without dissent. 48 FR 23,529 (1983).In this regard, the Board notes that, unless section 4(c)(5) is read asreflected in andSection;225.22(c)(4) of Regulation Y, direct acquisitionsby holding companies of finance, mortgage banking, leasing, data processing,and similar companies engaged in activities permissible for national bankswould be permissible without regard to the capital adequacy, conflict ofinterest, safety and soundness and other public benefits criteria of section4(c)(8). Moreover, these acquisitions, in many cases involving substantialportions of the capital resources of the holding company, would be subjectto no regulatory review.The Board notes that the Court of Appeals in <T3>AMBAC </T3>has granted a petition by the Comptroller for rehearingof the BHC Act issues in that case which involve the acquisition of sharesby a holding company national bank in reliance on section 4(c)(5) and theBoard's national bank operations subsidiary rule (12 CFR 225.22(d)(1)).Accordingly, the Board is taking no action to complete its rulemaking proceedingwith respect to andSection;225.22(d)(1) at this time. Depending on the outcomeof the <T3>AMBAC </T3>case and this rulemaking proceeding, the Board will considerappropriate action regarding this section of its rules.F. Applicability of Section 7 of the Act to the Acquisition By HoldingCompany State Banks of Operations Subsidiaries and Their Shares.The Board has also considered whether, as some argue, section 7 of theAct authorizes the Board's state bank operations subsidiary rule. Section7 provides that ``the enactment by the Congress of the (BHC) Act shallnot be construed as preventing any State from exercising such powers andjurisdiction which it now has or may hereafter have with respect to companies,banks, bank holding companies, and subsidiaries thereof.'' 12 U.S.C. 1846.That section does not, and was not intended to, limit the applicabilityof the nonbanking provisions of section 4, or provide an exemption forstate bank operations subsidiaries. As the Supreme Court has noted, section7 is intended only ``to define the extent of the (Act's) pre-emptive effecton state law.'' <T3>Lewis </T3>v. <T3>BT Investment Managers, Inc. </T3>447 U.S. 27, 49 (1980). The SenateReport on the original 1956 Act is explicit that section 7 was intendedto make it clear that, while the states retained concurrent jurisdictionover banks and bank holding companies, ``a State could not enact legislationinconsistent with the bill and therefore nullify its effect.'' \1\\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\4\ S. Rep. No. 1095, pt. 2, 84th Cong., 2d Sess. 5 (1986);102 Cong. Rec. 6751, 6758 (1956) (remarks of Senator Robertson).The fact that, under this interpretation of section 7 of the Act, the Boardand the state banking authorities would share concurrent jurisdiction overnonbank subsidiaries of holding company state banks is not new in the federalbanking laws. For example, the Board and the states share supervisory authorityover state member banks, including the scope of their activities,\1\\5\<NOTE/> as do the FDIC and the states with respect to nonmember banks.\1\\6\<NOTE/> Moreover, the BHC Act grants the Board full examination,reporting, and subpoena authority over national and state banks owned bybank holding companies, even though the Comptroller and the states havesimilar authority over national and state banks, respectively. 12 U.S.C.1844(c). The Supreme Court has recognized that the regulatory frameworkof the BHC Act overlaps with statutes administered by other banking authorities,and has left no doubt that, in such situations, the requirements of theBHC Act prevail. <T3>Board of Govenrors </T3>v. <T3>First Lincolnwood Corp., </T3>439 U.S. 234, 240-41, 250-51 (1978).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\ <T3>See e.g. </T3>12 U.S.C. 322, 12 CFR 208.7(a)(1).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\ <T3>See </T3>12 U.S.C. 1816.<ITAG tagnum="85">II. Proposed Rules Governing the Acquisition and Retention of OperationsSubsidiaries by Holding Company State Banks under the Bank Holding CompanyAct. </ITAG>A. GenerallyRescission of the state bank operations subsidiary rule would require bankholding companies to obtain approval under section 4(c)(8) of the Act inorder for their subsidiary state banks to acquire operations subsidiariesor for these subsidiaries to commence nonbanking activities (unless theacquisition falls under one of the other exemptions in the Act, <T3>e.g., </T3>servicing activities). In order to minimize the impact andregulatory burdens on these future acquisitions or proposals, the Boardis requesting comment on an expedited 30-day notice procedure under whichbank holding companies could seek the necessary approval under section4(c)(8). The Board also recognizes that a number of bank holding companies haveacquired operations subsidiaries, through their subsidiary state banks,without approval under section 4(c)(8), in reliance on the Board's existingstate bank operations subsidiary regulation. Rescission of this rule wouldrequire these bank holding companies to obtain approval under section 4(c)(8)of the Act to retain these operations subsidiaries unless the retentionis otherwise authorized under the Act. The Board notes that a great number of bank holding companies already havethe necessary approval under section 4(c)(8) to acquire or retain operationssubsidiaries engaged in a broad range of activities. For these companies,no further approval under the Act would be required if the operations subsidiaryrule were rescinded. Under existing rules, a bank holding company thathas secured approval under section 4(c)(8) to engage in a nonbanking activity,either directly or through a subsidiary, may open a new office or createa new subsidiary to conduct the activity, generally without further approvalunder the Act. 12 CFR 225.23(b)(1). For example, a bank holding companythat has secured approval under section 4(c)(8) to engage in lending activitieswithout geographic limit could conduct this activity on a <T3>de novo </T3>basis through any of its subsidiaries, including throughan operations subsidiary of one of its state banks, without further approvalunder the Act. Where the bank holding company has not previously obtained approval undersection 4(c)(8) of the Act for a particular activity conducted by an operationssubsidiary, the Board is proposing for comment a rule that would permitbank holding companies, without an application under section 4(c)(8) ofthe Act, to retain all or most existing operations subsidiaries acquiredin reliance on the Board's current rule. B. Future Acquisitions of Operations Subsidiaries 1. <T3>Listed Activities. </T3>The Board proposes to establish an expedited30-day notice procedure for banking holding companies seeking approvalunder section 4(c)(8) of the Act to acquire, through a subsidiary statebank, an operations subsidiary engaged in activities the Board has previouslyfound by regulation to be closely related to banking or for such a subsidiaryto commence, or acquire assets or shares of a company engaged in, theseactivities. Under the proposed procedure, holding company state banks mayestablish operations subsidiaries, insofar as the BHC Act is concerned,after the holding company provides the appropriate Reserve Bank with 30days prior written notice of the proposal. This expedited notice procedurewould apply to operations subsidiaries that are wholly owned by the statebank, as under the existing rule, and that engage in activities that areboth permissible under state law for the bank directly and that the Boardhas determined, by regulation, to be closely related to banking under section4(c)(8). The Board asks for comment on whether the notice procedures shouldalso be available for activities that have been found closely related tobanking by order in an individual case.\17\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\17\ If the Board adopts this procedure, it proposes to amendits existing rules to allow bank holding companies to file notices forsuch acquisitions also. 12 CFR 225.23(a)(1). The notice required under this procedure would be limitd to a brief descriptionof the proposal and the activity that would be conducted by the operationssubsidiary, a reference to the relevant provisions of Regulation Y or Boardorder that found the activity to be closely related to banking, and a copyof any notice or application submitted by the state bank to its primaryregulator for approval to establish or acquire the operations subsidiaryunder state law or for the subsidiary to commence a new activity. The appropriate Reserve Bank would act on all notices submitted under thisprocedure within 30 days of their submission in accordance with the existingexpedited notice procedures in andSection; 225.23(a)(1) of Regulation Y.the proposed notice procedure would be available not only for <T3>de novo </T3>proposals, but also could be used for proposals to acquirethe shares or assets of going concerns. As an alternative, the Board asksfor comment on whether the notice procedure should be limited to proposalsto engage <T3>de novo </T3>in listed activities, and a fuller application requiredfor acquisitions of going concerns, as is the case under existing rulesfor bank holding companies. 12 CFR andSection; 225.23(a)(2).The Reserve Bank would have the discretion to require an application orfuller information regarding a proposal described in the notice, but wouldgenerally do so only where the bank holding company does not meet the Board'scapital adequacy guidelines, or where the condition of the bank holdingcompany organization or the nature of the proposed new activity warrantsa more extensive analysis.The Board asks for comment on whether there are certain activities on theRegulation Y list of closely related to banking activities that shouldnot be permitted for a subsidiary of a holding company bank, but only allowedthrough a direct subsidiary of the bank holding company.2. <T3>Unlisted Activities. </T3>In the case of proposals by operations subsidiariesinvolving activities that have not been added to the list of permissibleactivities in andSection; 225.25(b) of Regulation Y, the Board proposes torequire an application under the procedures currently established in theBoard's regulations for such proposals. <T3>See </T3>12 CFR 225.23(a)(3). In considering these applications, the Board will give full considerationto the finding by the state that the activity is permissible for statebanks in that state. In this regard, in determining whether an activityis closely related to banking, the Board and the courts have looked primarilyto whether banks in fact conduct the activity.\18\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\18\ <T3>National Courier Assn. </T3>v. <T3>Board of Governors, </T3>516 F.2d 1229 (D.C.

Retentionof Existing Operations SubsidiariesTo deal with the impact of the proposed rescission of andSection; 225.22(d)(2)on existing operations subsidiaries, the Board is requesting public commenton a proposal that would permit bank holding companies, without furtherapproval under the BHC Act, to retain operations subsidiaries held by theirsubsidiary state banks in compliance with that regulation on November 21,1988, the date of the proposal to rescind andSection; 225.22(d)(2). Entitlementto this provision would be available only if the operations subsidiarywas in compliance with that rule on November 21, 1988, that is, the subsidiarymust be wholly-owned by the parent bank (except for directors' qualifyingshares) and the subsidiary must be engaged only in activities that theparent bank could conduct directly under relevant state law at locationsat which the bank could conduct the activities.The Board notes that the courts have ruled in a number of cases that changesin regulations that adversely affect parties should ordinarily be appliedonly prospectively.\19\<NOTE/> The courts have been particularly concerned about retroactiveapplication of new regulations in circumstances in which affected partieshave reasonably relied on the existing regulation in conducting their affairsand would suffer detriment under the new rule.\20\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\19\ <T3>See, e.g., Georgetown University Hospital </T3>v. <T3>Bowen, </T3>821 F.2d 750 (D.C.

In addition, many of these operations subsidiaries were formed<T3>de novo, </T3>rather than through acquisition of going concerns, andtheir retention and continued operation would be likely to promote competition,increase customer convenience, and enhance operating efficiencies. Retentionof these subsidiaries also would not involve additional expenditures offunds or increased debt. Consequently, the financial impact of the retentionproposal should in most cases be negligible. For these reasons, the Boardbelieves retention of these subsidiaries would, as a general matter, satisfythe requirements under section 4(c)(8) that the activity be closely relatedto banking and that the public benefits of the proposal outweigh its adverseeffects.The Board notes that under the grandfather proposal, bank holding companies,in some cases, could retain indirectly operations subsidiaries that engagein activities that the Board has not determined to be closely related tobanking, such as certain insurance or real estate development activities.\21\<NOTE/> The Board requests comment on whether under the principlesarticulated by the courts regarding the retroactive application of agencyrules, as discussed in the cases noted above, the Board is authorized toapply any rescission of its operations subsidiary rule only prospectively,thereby permitting bank holding companies to retain these subsidiariesas well as subsidiaries conducting activities that have been determinedto be closely related to banking. The Board also seeks comment on whether,if it is so authorized, it should permit these subsidiaries to be retainedor should prohibit their retention without an application and compliancewith the standards of section 4(c)(8) of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\21\ The Board currently has a proposed rule under considerationto authorize real estate investment and development activities for bankholding companies under section 4(c)(8) within certain prudential limits.52 FR 543 (January 7, 1987); 50 FR 4519 (January 31, 1985).The Board further asks for comment on whether, from the point of view ofthe prudential standards in section 4(c)(8), the Board should permit activitiesthat involve high risk, such as real estate development if it were authorizedunder section 4(c)(8) of the Act for bank holding companies, to be conductedonly through a direct subsidiary of the bank holding company subject toappropriate prudential limitations and not through subsidiaries of holdingcompany banks.The Board further asks for comment on whether the proposed grandfatherrule should contain a provision permitting the Board to determine, in anindividual case, after notice and opportunity for the affected bank holdingcompany to comment, that a particular activity that has not previouslybeen determined by the Board to be closely related to banking, is not permissibleunder the standards set forth in section 4(c)(8) of the Act and must, therefore,be terminated by the company.Finally, the Board asks for comment as to whether to limit the grandfatherproposal for operations subsidiaries established under andSection; 225.22(d)(2)prior to November 21, 1988, to only those subsidiaries engaged in activitiespreviously found by the Board, by regulation or order, to be closely relatedto banking under section 4(c)(8). Because these subsidiaries would meetthe Act's closely-related to banking standard and because, as discussedabove, the retention of the subsidiary would be likely to result in publicbenefits that outweigh potential adverse effects, the Board believes thatthis option would satisfy the terms of section 4(c)(8) and that individualapplications to retain these subsidiaries would not be required. In supportof this proposal, the Board notes that under section 4(c)(8) the Boardmay act by order or by regulation in authorizing nonbanking proposals.As discussed above, the Board is asking for comment on whether it shouldrequire that certain of these activities that may involve high risk shouldbe conducted only through direct subsidiaries of the bank holding company.As discussed in Part I, as a result of the Garn-St Germain Act insuranceamendments, the Board has no discretion under section 4(c)(8) to permitbank holding companies or their nonbank subsidiaries to engage in the UnitedStates in insurance activities, except as specifically authorized in thoseamendments.\2\\2\<NOTE/> One of these provisions permits a holding company subsidiaryto continue any insurance agency activity it conducted on May 1, 1982.The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit recentlyaffirmed a Board decision recognizing that an operations subsidiary ofa holding company state bank selling insurance on May 1, 1982, in relianceon the Board's state bank operations subsidiary rule, qualifies for thisgrandfather exception and may continue to sell insurance under section4(c)(8).\2\\3\<NOTE/> Accordingly, the Board believes that, if the state bank operationssubsidiary rule is rescinded, state banks could continue to hold operationssubsidiaries engaged in general or other insurance agency activities thatthey conducted on May 1, 1982, in accordance with the Board's state bankoperations subsidiary rule and without further application under the BHCAct.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\2\ For example, the amendments permit bank holding companiesto sell credit-related life, accident, health and unemployment insurance.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\3\ <T3>National Association of Casualty and Surety Agents </T3>v. <T3>Board of Governors, </T3>856 F.2d 282 (D.C.

Legal Framework Relating to the Proposed Rescission of the StateBank Operations Subsidiary Rule.</ITAG>A. The Literal Terms of the BHC ActCover the Acquisition and Retention by Holding Company Banks of Controlof Companies (other than Banks) and Their Voting SharesThe BHC Act establishes a comprehensive framework governing the acquisitionsand activities of bank holding companies. Section 4 of the Act containstwo prohibitions that together limit the nonbanking acquisitions and activitiesof bank holding companies to those expressly permitted under various specificprovisions in the statute. Under these prohibitions, a holding companymay not acquire or retain, directly or through a subsidiary, voting sharesor subsidiaries unless the shares or subsidiary are authorized under oneof the Act's exemptions.Section 4 of the Act provides that, except as set forth in the Act, bankholding companies may not (1) acquire or retain direct or <T3>indirect</T3> control of voting shares of ``any company which is nota bank,'' or (2) engage in activities other than banking or managing andcontrolling banks and other subsidiaries authorized under the Act and thoseactivities permitted under the closely related to banking standards ofsection 4(c)(8) of the Act.\2\\5\<NOTE/> Section 4 then sets out certain exceptions from these generalprohibitions, the principal one being for companies engaged in activitiesthe Board, after notice and opportunity for hearing, has determined tobe so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto.\2\\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\5\ Section 4(a) of the Act provides:<ITAG tagnum="28">Except as otherwise provided in this Act, no bank holding companyshall_</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">(1) * * * acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any votingshares of any company which is not a bank, or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">(2) * * * retain direct or indirect ownership or control of any votingshares of any company which is not a bank or bank holding company, or engagein any activities other than (A) those of banking, or of managing or controllingbanks and other subsidiaries authorized under this Act * * *, and (B) thosepermitted under paragraph (8) of subsection (c) (that is, those found bythe Board to be closely related to banking) * * * 12 U.S.C. 1843(a)(1)and (2).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">The activity provision in section 4(a)(2) of the Act limits the directactivities of a bank holding company.

The other exceptions to the generalnonbanking provisions of the Act are set out in paragraphs (1) through(14) of section 4(c) of the Act and include exemptions for holding sharesof servicing subsidiaries, of companies acquired in satisfaction of debtspreviously contracted or in a fiduciary capacity, shares of the kinds andamounts eligible for investment by a national bank under section 5136 ofthe Revised Statutes, shares of an investment company, shares amountingto less than 5 percent of a company's outstanding shares, shares of certainforeign companies, and shares of an export trading company. 12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(1)through (14). There are certain other grandfather exceptions found in section4(a)(2) of the Act. 12 U.S.C. 1843(a)(2).By their terms, the prohibitions of section 4 apply not only to votingshares and nonbank companies controlled directly by a bank holding companybut also to shares and nonbank companies controlled by the bank holdingcompany <T3>indirectly</T3> through any of its subsidiaries.\2\\7\<NOTE/> Section 2(g)(1) of the Act is explicit that ``shares ownedor controlled <T3>by any subsidiary</T3> of a bank holding company shall be deemed tobe <T3>indirectly</T3> owned or controlled by such bank holding company.''12 U.S.C. 1841(g)(1)(emphasis added). The attribution provisions in thissection apply to voting shares held by ``any subsidiary'' of a holdingcompany and do not distinguish between shares held by a subsidiary bankof a bank holding company or by a nonbank subsidiary of a bank holdingcompany.\2\\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\7\ A holding company's subidiaries include direct as wellas indirect subsidiaries. 12 U.S.C. 1841(d)(1).

A ``subsidiary'' of a bank holdingcompany is defined to include ``any company'' 25 percent or more of thevoting shares of which is directly or indirectly owned or controlled bythat holding company. <T3>Id.</T3> That the term ``subsidiary'' as used in the BHC Act encompassesbanks is evident in provisions throughout the Act. <T3>E.g.,</T3> 12 U.S.C. 1842(a)(2), 1844(c). Section 4(a)(2) itself confirmsthis when it limits holding companies to controlling ``banks and othersubsidiaries authorized under this Act.'' 12 U.S.C. 1843(a)(2).Thus, under the unambiguous language of the statute, the voting sharesof a company held by a holding company bank are indirectly owned or controlledby the parent holding company and, in order for the shares or subsidiaryto be retained, they must fit within one of the exceptions to the generalprohibitions in section 4(a).This reading of the statutory language is confirmed by its legislativehistory. Congress added the attribution provisions in section 2(g)(1) tothe Act in 1966 \29\<NOTE/> ``to confirm current interpretations of the Board (that)provide that a bank holding company shall be deemed to control indirectlyany shares owned or controlled by any of its subsidiaries * * *.''

The fact that Congressadded these exemptions to the Act to exempt the fiduciary and DPC acquisitionsof holding company banks is explainable only by the conclusion that Congressrecognized and intended the Act to apply to the acquisition of nonbankshares by a holding company bank.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\30\ <T3>See</T3> Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, Pub.

As explained above,Board interpretations expressing this view, issued in 1956 and 1957 contemporaneouslywith passage of the Act, were subsequently codified in section 2(g)(1)of the Act. 12 CFR 225.101 and 102.

In 1971, the Board reaffirmed its view that section 4 applies to nonbanksubsidiaries of holding company banks in connection with its promulgationof andSection; 225.22(d) of Regulation Y (then andSection; 225.4(e)), providinga regulatory exemption from the nonbanking prohibitions of the Act butonly for wholly owned operations subsidiaries doing business at locationsat which the state bank could conduct the activity and subject to limitationsapplicable to the bank.\36\<NOTE/> Since 1956, acquisitions of companies engaged in activitiesnot permissible for the bank or of less than 100 percent of the sharesof a company engaged in bank-eligible activities has not been permittedunder the Board's rules without compliance with section 4 of the Act. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\36\ In its notice of rulemaking, the Board stated its viewthat the proposed limitation ``would not affect the scope of activitiespermitted to a banking subsidiary of a bank holding company, but couldaffect acquisitions of a nonbanking company by such a bank since any acquisitionby a subsidiary bank would represent an indirect acquisition by the parentholding company.'' 36 FR 1431 (1971).

(``The Board has long held that the provisions of theAct apply to acquisitions by holding company banks of voting shares ofa nonbanking company.'') D. Views of Commenters on Act's Coverage to Acquisitionsof Shares by Holding Company BanksIn response to the Board's request for comments regarding the real estatedevelopment activities of bank holding companies, a number of commentershave argued that the Board has no authority to regulate the activitiesof nonbank subsidiaries of holding company banks. The commenters arguethat the BHC Act does not by its terms permit the Board to regulate thedirect activities of holding company banks and that the legislative historyof the Act indicates that Congress did not intend the BHC Act to confersuch authority on the Board. Based on the argument that the BHC Act doesnot extend to the activities of banks owned by holding companies, the commentersargue that a nonbank subsidiary of a bank is also exempt from the Act becauseit is merely an incorporated department or division of the bank operatingunder color of the bank's charter and authority. These commenters suggestthat Congress could not have intended to create the anomalous result ofexcluding holding company banks from the Board's authority under the BHCAct while granting the Board authority over the nonbank operating subsidiariesof those same banks. The Board notes, however, that this view appears to advocate an interpretationof the Act that is inconsistent with the express terms of the BHC Act,which as noted apply to the direct or indirect nonbanking subsidiariesof a bank holding company without distinction between nonbank companiesowned by the holding company and those owned by a bank subsidiary of theholding company.\38\<NOTE/> Since nonbank subsidiaries of holding company banks are bydefinition not banks, they are not excluded from section 4 of the Act.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\38\ In support of their view that section 4(a) does not applyto subsidiaries or nonvoting shares held by holding company banks, somecommenters rely on <T3>Cameron Financial Corp.</T3> v. <T3>Board of Governors,</T3> 497 F.2d 841, 848 (4th Cir. 1974). That decision,however, held only that since section 4(a) does not apply to banks, activitiesconducted directly by banks do not qualify under the grandfather provisoin section 4(a)(2). In that context, the reference to the term subsidiaryin the grandfather proviso means a subsidiary that is not a bank and thatwould, therefore, not be subject to the nonbank provisions of section 4(a)in the first place. This case does not address the question raised by thecommenters in this proceeding whether section 4 applies to activities conductedby a subsidiary of the bank and not by the bank itself. <ITAG tagnum="28">Some commenters have also referred to the fact that section 4 is entitled``Interests in Nonbanking Organizations.'' That argument supports onlythe position that section 4 applies to nonbank companies wherever locatedwithin a bank holding company organization. </ITAG>Moreover, the commenters' view that a nonbank subsidiary of a bank is merelypart of its bank parent appears to conflict with the facts generally associatedwith the formation of many such subsidiaries. They are separately incorporatedentities, in many cases with different names, offices, and employees, andare formed largely in order to permit the parent to separate and insulateitself from the activities of the subsidiary in order to limit its liabilityfor the activities conducted by the subsidiary. In this regard, the Board notes that the other federal banking agencieshave often expressed the view that subsidiaries of banks provide an effectivemechanism to separate and insulate nonbanking activities from the bankand the support of the federal safety net. For example, the Comptrollerof the Currency has recently stated that the functions of subsidiariesof national banks_at least those conducting certain new types of activities_shouldbe insulated from the parent bank in order to protect the insured depositsof the parent from risks arising from its ownership of the subsidiary.\39\<NOTE/> The FDIC has specifically recognized that a subsidiary ofa bank is a separate entity, which should not be confused with the bankitself.\40\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\39\ <T3>Reform of the Nation's Banking and Financial Systems, Hearings Beforethe House Committee on Banking, Finance, and Urban Affairs, </T3>100thCong., 1st Sess. 283, 287 (1987) (Statement of Comptroller Clarke). <T3>See also </T3>Statement of FDIC Chairman Seidman, <T3>Id., </T3>at 126, 128. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\40\ <T3>See also, </T3>50 FR 23964 (1985); Mandate for Change: Restructuringthe Banking Industry, A Staff Study, FDIC (August 18, 1987). 1. <T3>Divestiture Provisions of Section 5(e) of BHC Act. </T3>Commentersalso point to section 5(e) of the BHC Act, which allows the Board to ordera bank holding company to terminate ownership or control of any nonbanksubsidiary ``other than a nonbank subsidiary of a bank'' where the nonbankconstitutes a serious risk to the safety and soundness of a holding companybank. 12 U.S.C. 1844(e). This provision was added to the Act in 1978 andis pointed to as evidence of Congressional intent that the Act does notapply to nonbank subsidiaries of holding company banks. This exemption, however, merely recognizes that primary responsibilityfor the ongoing supervision of the bank and its safety and soundness restswith the bank's primary supervisor, which has adequate enforcement authorityto protect the bank against safety and soundness risks from nonbank subsidiaries.This section does not in any way attempt to regulate the kinds of nonbankingactivities that the nonbank subsidiary may conduct or by its terms exemptthe activities of such a nonbank subsidiary from the Act. Indeed, the Boardnotes that the fact that Congress excluded nonbank subsidiaries of holdingcompany banks from only this provision of the Act suggests that such subsidiariesare to be included as subsidiaries of the bank holding company for allother provisions of the Act where they are not so excluded, including thenonbanking provisions of section 4. Moreover, if nonbank subsidiaries ofholding company banks are not subject to the Act, the exclusion in section5(e) is unnecessary. 2. <T3>Board Authority Over Nonbank Subsidiaries of Holding Company BanksUnder the Financial Institutions Supervisory Act of 1966. </T3>Similarly,some commenters have argued that the cease-and-desist authority of theBoard under the Financial Institutions Supervisory Act of 1966 (``FISA'')(12 U.S.C. 1818(b)(3)) does not extend to nonbank subsidiaries of holdingcompany banks and that this demonstrates that the BHC Act also does notapply to such subsidiaries. This argument, however, appears based on amisreading of the statute. In fact, the terms of the cease-and-desist statute(12 U.S.C. 1818(b)(3)) confirm that section 4(a) of the BHC Act appliesto subsidiaries of holding company banks as indirect subsidiaries of thebank holding company. FISA grants the Board cease and desist authorityover ``any bank holding company and [to] any subsidiary (other than a bank)of a holding company, as those terms are defined in the Act.'' As noted,a subsidiary of a holding company bank is, as a matter of law, a subsidiaryof the holding company and is, thus, contrary to the commenters' claims,subject to the Board's cease-and-desist authority. The second sentence of section 1818(b)(3), in recognition of the Board'sexclusive jurisdiction over holding companies, establishes the rule thatthe other federal banking agencies may not issue a cease and desist orderagainst bank holding companies or their subsidiaries ``(other than a bankor a subsidiary of that bank)''.\41\<NOTE/> The parenthetical language is necessary to prevent the primaryfederal supervisor from losing cease and desist authority over banks andtheir subsidiaries that are also subsidiaries of a bank holding company.The parenthetical does not, however, mean, as some claim, that the Boardhas no cease and desist authority over nonbank subsidiaries of holdingcompany banks.\42\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\41\ 12 U.S.C. 1818(b)(3) states: ``Nothing in this subsection* * * shall authorize any Federal banking agency, <T3>other than the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, </T3>toissue a notice of charges or cease-and-desist order against a bank holdingcompany or any subsidiary thereof (<T3>other than a bank or subsidiary of that bank</T3>).'' <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\42\ If the commenters' view were correct that the Board'scease and desist authority does not extend to subsidiaries of the holdingcompany banks, the exclusion in the first sentence of 12 U.S.C. 1818(b)(3)would read as does the exclusion in the second sentence, that is, the Board'scease and desist authority under the first sentence would be limited to``any bank holding company, and to any subsidiary (other than a bank orsubsidiary of that bank)''. Thus, the cease and desist provisions recognize a distinction between holdingcompany banks and nonbank subsidiaries of such banks and grant the Boardconcurrent authority over the nonbank subsidiaries of holding company banks.The concurrent cease and desist authority over nonbank subsidiaries ofholding company banks is necessary to enable the Board to enforce the BHCAct as it applies to these subsidiaries while allowing the appropriatebanking authority to enforce provisions of law for which it has responsibility.This grant of authority to the Board under FISA would be unnecessary ifCongress had intended, as the commenters suggest, that nonbank subsidiariesof holding company banks were to be considered as part of the parent bankand outside the Board's jurisdiction for purposes of the BHC Act. 3. <T3>Legislative History of 1970 Amendments to BHC Act. </T3>Some commenterspoint to the following testimony of Chairman Burns regarding the 1970 Amendmentsto the BHC Act as support for the claim that Congress did not intend theBHC Act to cover subsidiaries of holding company banks:<ITAG tagnum="21">We now have three Federal agencies regulating banks.

The testimony, however, says nothing about nonbanksubsidiaries of holding company banks and in no way indicates that section4(a) does not apply to the acquisition of shares or subsidiaries by holdingcompany banks. As discussed above, the Board's long-held position predatingChairman Burns' testimony had been that the Act does apply to the acquisitionof shares of nonbank companies by holding company banks. Moreover, threeweeks after enactment of the 1970 Amendments, the Board reiterated thisview in proposing rules to implement that legislation. 30 FR 1430, 1431,and 9292 (1971).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\44\ The Board is given extensive authority under the BHCAct over holding company banks, including direct authority to examine anyholding company subsidiary, including subsidiary banks, and to requirereports and to issue subpoenas against such institutions. 12 U.S.C. 1844.The Board has also considered the reference by some commenters to the HouseBanking Committee report associated with the 1970 Amendments stating thatthe nonbanking restrictions of section 4 apply only to bank holding companiesand their nonbank subsidiaries and ``not to the bank subsidiaries'' whoseactivities are governed by other Federal and State law. H. Rep. No. 387,91st Cong., 1st Sess. 15 (1969).

Asthe terms of the Act demonstrate, Congress rationally did so on the basisof whether the company conducting the activity is a bank or a nonbank.Thus, where the company is chartered and operated as a bank under the definitionin the BHC Act, it is outside the scope of the nonbanking provisions ofthe Act. But where the company is not a bank, it is, consistent with theline drawn by Congress in section 4, subject to the nonbanking provisionsof the Act_wherever located within a bank holding company system_and inorder for these activities to be permissible, they must fit within oneof the Act's authorizing provisions.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis</ITAG>This rulemaking has been initiated to permit public comment on whetherthe Board is required to rescind its existing state bank operations subsidiaryrule in light of the terms of section 4 of the BHC Act. If the Board isrequired to rescind its rule, the Board has proposed several proceduresthat are designed to mitigate the effect of this action on bank holdingcompanies, including the economic impact on bank holding companies thatmay be small business entities within the meaning of the Reguatory FlexibilityAct (5 U.S.C 601 <T3>et seq</T3>). In particular, the Board has proposed several alternativesfor permitting bank holding companies, including small bank holding companies,to retain all or most existing operations subsidiaries held through statebank subsidiaries. The Board has also proposed an expedited notice procedurefor future acquisitions of operations subsidiaries that has been designedto minimize any procedural burden on bank holding companies, includingsmall bank holding companies.The Board notes that a great number of bank holding companies already havereceived Board approval to engage in the activities conducted by operationssubsidiaries of holding company state banks, and may, therefore, retainand establish such operations subsidiaries engaged in these activitieswithout further approval. As a result, this proposal may have little orno effect on many bank holding companies, including in particular smallbank holding companies, that engage in activities already approved by theBoard under the Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 225</ITAG>Banks, Banking, Federal Reserve System, Holding companies, Reporting andrecordkeeping requirements.For the reasons set out in this notice, and pursuant to the Board's authorityunder section 5(b) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended(12 U.S.C. 1844(b)), the Board proposes to amend 12 CFR Part 225 as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 225_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
