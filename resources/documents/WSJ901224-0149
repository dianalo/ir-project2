The auto maker distributed the payments this month,instead of in January as originally planned, because &quot;taxrates are higher next year,&quot; said Robert A. Lutz, presidentof Chrysler Motors.</LP><TEXT>   But the federal income tax rates are primarily increasingin 1991 for the wealthiest Chrysler executives -- the sameones who decided to change the timing of the payments. Thefar greater number of managers who are eligible for thepayments earn less money, and receiving the payments thismonth instead of in January creates significant taxdisadvantages for them.   The income-tax rate for many of these managers will bereduced next year, under the new federal tax law. Also, thesemanagers will have to pay taxes on the compensation a yearearlier than they previously had planned.   The move has angered many managers at Chrysler who weren'taware the change was coming, and who have been asked by topmanagement to make deep sacrifices over the past 1 1/2 years.&quot;Something like this makes it seem like we have to carry moreof the burden here than those at the top,&quot; complained oneChrysler manager, who asked not to be named. &quot;At the veryleast it sends the wrong message.&quot;   &quot;It's going to hurt some people to put a lump sum outthere&quot; this year instead of next, conceded Chrysler spokesmanThomas Houston. &quot;We did what was deemed to be the best foreveryone at the time.&quot;   Chrysler declined to disclose how much any of itsexecutives will receive from the stock and cash payments.Amounts given to officers such as Chairman Lee A. Iacocca,Vice Chairman R.S. Miller Jr. and Mr. Lutz won't be discloseduntil the company sends out its proxy statement this spring.   The money involved is substantial in some cases. Under theunusual &quot;bet-your check&quot; program that Chrysler set up in July1989, managers could wager as much as 10% of their annualsalary against the company's ability to meet a $1 billioncost-cutting goal by the end of this year. By exceeding thattarget the 2,000 senior managers and executives whoparticipated doubled their money.   The one-time stock awards have a different purpose.Chrysler established them last summer to compensate 1,800top-level employees who weren't getting their usual cashbonuses, which can equal half of their total compensation.Chrysler couldn't give out the regular bonuses because of aunion contract that prevents such pay-outs when hourlyworkers don't get profit-sharing checks. Omitting the bonushad been the major reason turnover tripled, as compared withthe normal level, earlier this year.   Under the new federal tax law, taxpayers earning more than$180,000 a year will see their tax rate increase to 31% in1991 from 28% this year. But because of a quirk in the taxstructure, those who earn $80,000 to $180,000 will actuallysee their tax rates drop to 31% from 33% this year.   Financial planners are encouraging their wealthiestclients to push as much income as they can into this year. Astudy by Arthur Andersen andamp; Co. showed a wealthy taxpayerexpecting a $55,000 bonus could save nearly 3% in taxes, orat least $1,470, by taking the bonus this year instead of in1991. That is even after considering profits that could havebeen reaped from investing the taxes instead of paying themto the Internal Revenue Service a year early. In any event,Chrysler's top executives are expected to get payments farlarger than the Arthur Andersen example.   Advisers are saying the exact opposite to those who gethit by the higher tax rate this year, but whose rates willdrop next year. &quot;If people are going to have to pay the 33%rate this year, they shouldn't pull any extra income intothis year if they can avoid it,&quot; said Nick Bubnovich, aconsultant with Arthur Andersen andamp; Co. in Chicago.   Chrysler's lower-ranking executives didn't have much of achoice, however. IRS rules discourage companies from givingemployees the option of taking compensation in one year orthe next.</TEXT></DOC>
