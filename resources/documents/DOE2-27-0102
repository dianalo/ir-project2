<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-27-0102 </DOCNO><TEXT>A pulsed, high-energy (andgt;5 J) KrF ultraviolet laser system has been developedand used in initial conditioning cell experiments with the IBEX 4-MVelectron beam accelerator. High currents (35 kA) have been efficientlyand stably transported in a 1-cm-diameter beam through low-pressure diethylaniline(DEA) vapor. Conditioning cell details, laser-accelerator parameters,and initial transport results are discussed. 5 refs., 4 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
