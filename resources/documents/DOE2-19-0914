The contribution of hydro power tothe Dutch electric power supply however is modest: a maximum of about0.5%. Within the University of Utrecht, Netherlands, a few studies havebeen executed, aimed at answering two questions: what is the economicallyoptimal configuration for a hydro power station for a particular location,and how much conventional power can be saved within the public electricpower supply by building hydro power stations. Studies in the field ofhydro energy executed in the Netherlands are shortly reviewed. Next theabove-mentioned questions are discussed: first the model method and thenthe calculation results. Finally some conclusions for the applicationof hydro power in the Netherlands are stated. 6 figs., 16 refs., 7 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
