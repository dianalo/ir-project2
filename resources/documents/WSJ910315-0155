The proposal calls for building or purchasing as many as25 large, speedy cargo vessels over the next decade at a costof $7.3 billion. Long-term maintenance and operating costscould add billions of dollars to those costs, but the Bushadministration is expected to ask Congress to authorize onlya small portion of the total this year.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;It is clear from all assessments&quot; of the Persian Gulfconflict, Navy Secretary Lawrence Garrett said in aconfidential memo to Navy brass earlier this month, &quot;thatacquisition of additional . . . ships is a top sealiftpriority.&quot; The memo ordered the start of detailed planningaimed at &quot;construction and/or purchase of commerciallyavailable ships,&quot; even before the full-blown plan iscompleted.   The plan is subject to final approval by Defense SecretaryDick Cheney, who has indicated some reluctance to spend largeamounts on cargo vessels when the Navy's combat fleet isslated to shrink 25% by the late 1990s. Still, the plantaking shape would reverse long-standing Pentagon policiesrelegating sealift to a relatively low priority. The Bushadministration, in fact, has been embroiled in a two-yeardispute with lawmakers because it has balked at spending mostof the $2 billion Congress earmarked to enhance militarysealift.   Faced with examples of delays and mechanical problems thathampered shipment of U.S. tanks, helicopters and othermilitary hardware to Saudi Arabia, high-ranking Pentagonplanners now are paying more attention to ensuring adequatesealift capacity to cope with any future military crisis.&quot;We've finally seen the light,&quot; Adm. Charles Larson, head ofthe Pacific command, told the Senate Defense Appropriationssubcommittee Wednesday. &quot;Everybody I've talked to is onboard.&quot;   The draft version of the plan circulating at the Pentagonand on Capitol Hill suggests doubling the current fleet ofeight fast cargo vessels available to the military, accordingto military and shipping industry officials. The Pentagonalso envisions acquiring 15 or more somewhat slower shipsthat can be loaded and unloaded quickly because tanks andother vehicles could roll directly on and off.   &quot;The experience in the Gulf proved that these assets arebadly needed,&quot; said John Stocker, president of theShipbuilders Council of America, one of the industry groupspushing for increased sealift expenditures. &quot;At last, theissue is being discussed and decisions are being made at thehighest {Pentagon} levels.&quot;   So far, many sealift proponents in Congress remainskeptical. &quot;We've been asking the Pentagon about this foryears, but nothing gets done,&quot; Sen. Trent Lott (R., Miss.)complained to Adm. Larson earlier this week. Noting thatabout $1.3 billion remains unspent in existing sealiftaccounts, Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.), another member of theappropriations subcommittee, said, &quot;We've got to do more thanuse the money that's left over.&quot;   On the House side, too, lawmakers aren't ready to endorsethe Pentagon's plan as adequate. &quot;The Navy recognizes theneed, but I don't see anyone coming up with a broad, vigorousplan&quot; to meet sealift requirements by revitalizing the U.S.shipbuilding industry, Rep. Charles Bennett (D., Fla.),chairman of the Armed Services subcommittee on seapower, saidyesterday in an interview.</TEXT></DOC>
