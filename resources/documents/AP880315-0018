Mrs. Byrne, the former mayor, says her last attempt at officewill be today when she runs in the Democratic primary for clerk ofthe nation's largest local court system.   Vrdolyak, a former alderman and former chairman of the powerfulCook County Democratic Party, wants the same office. But he's now aRepublican running unopposed in the GOP primary.   A victory by either candidate in November's general electioncould give a jump start to his or her political future. But a losscould be politically fatal.   ``It's a position that has some patronage, it has jobs,'' saidPaul Kleppner, a social scientist at Northern Illinois Universityand analyst of Chicago politics.   ``More important than the number of jobs, if you're anoffice-holder, you can grab the media. As Jane Byrne once said, thenew precinct captain in this age is television,'' Kleppner saidMonday.   Mrs. Byrne was in a tough primary race with Aurelia Pucinski,the county Democratic Party's endorsed candidate and daughter offiery Alderman Roman Pucinski.   Mrs. Byrne, mayor from 1979 to 1983, was ousted by HaroldWashington, who became the city's first black chief executive andthen withstood an election challenge from her last year.   Besides announcing proposals to streamline the court system'sbureaucracy and broaden services for county residents outsideChicago, Mrs. Byrne and Mrs. Pucinski have mostly haggled over whohad the late mayor's affection.   Washington supported Mrs. Pucinski and the party's slate ofendorsed candidates just a few days before he died Nov. 23.   But in Mrs. Byrne's effort to appeal to Chicago's powerful blackvoting bloc, she points to a unity breakfast she had withWashington after he won the primary last February.   Mrs. Byrne also pulls out a newspaper article that quotes Mrs.Pucinski as saying she wasn't Washington's first choice for theclerk's job.   Mrs. Pucinski has countered with a radio blitz featuringprominent black politicians and even Washington's half brother,Ramon Price.   ``Harold believed we had come too far to go back to the days ofthe bosses. ... That's why Harold chose Aurelia Pucinski,'' Pricesays on the ad, broadcast on black-oriented radio stations.   But Mrs. Pucinski's alderman father was viewed among blacks asan obstructionist during Washington's reign as mayor.   ``I would expect Byrne to get the black vote,'' Kleppner said.``The question is how much.''   Vrdolyak, an alderman for 15 years, lost power to Washington inthe City Council and waged an unsuccessful bid against him on athird-party ticket last April. Vrdolyak subsequently resigned fromthe chairmanship of the county Democratic organization to become aRepublican.   With no primary opponent, Vrdolyak has spent most of his timetalking about demanding integrity and honesty from the courtsystem's 2,000 employees.   He's also portraying Democrats as big taxers and spenders,hoping to get conservative Democratic voters to join his cause inNovember. At a rally Sunday for Vice President George Bush,Vrdolyak said ``they don't represent you.''   ``They don't hardly represent anybody any more,'' he said.   If Mrs. Byrne survives the primary and meets Vrdolyak inNovember, the clerk's race will feature two former allies. Vrdolyakwas her floor leader in the City Council, and she once helpedinstall him as chairman of the county Democratic Party.   Today, the affection is lost.   ``He's devious. He's a wheeler-dealer,'' she told a newspaperlast week. ``It's distasteful. ... I don't like him. He's not mycup of tea.''</TEXT></DOC>
