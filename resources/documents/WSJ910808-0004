Tracy Borumtook her new recruits to the rifle range, she considereddonning a helmet and bulletproof vest.   &quot;These are people who'd never even played at aiming a toygun,&quot; she says of her cadets, the first women ever to enlistin the army of the United Arab Emirates. &quot;They were scared,and I was, too.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   But by the time they graduated five months later, thewomen had mastered M16 assault rifles, Russianrocket-propelled grenades, multi-purpose machine guns, handgrenades and 9mm pistols.   In the conservative societies of the Arabian peninsula,the idea of women warriors seems incredible. In neighboringSaudi Arabia, women still aren't allowed to drive cars orwalk in the streets alone. Even here in the more liberalUnited Arab Emirates, women only recently have entered thework force. No one expected them to join the army any timethis century.   &quot;Saddam Hussein made it happen,&quot; says Hadra Dawish, 24,who graduated at the top of her cadet class. &quot;If Iraq hadn'tinvaded Kuwait, I wouldn't be doing this.&quot; Before enlisting,she worked with handicapped children, never setting footoutside her house without a veil over her face and a longblack cloak shrouding her body. Now she wears camouflagefatigues adapted for the Islamic law that women mustn't showtheir hair or curves of the body. Her jacket is cut longerand looser than a U.S. soldier's. Under her beret, her hairand neck are wrapped in a tightly tucked scarf.   The push to recruit women came from Sheika Fatima, themain wife of the Emirates' ruler, Sheik Zayed. The sheikawears a traditional cloth face-mask, or &quot;burka&quot;, and never isphotographed, but she heads the local Women's Association andpromotes women's rights. For her, Iraq's quick conquest ofneighboring Kuwait proved that Gulf states needed more oftheir own nationals in their armies. &quot;We wanted to minimizethe foreigners in the army, but with such a small population{less than a half million citizens} there was no way to do itwithout the participation of our local ladies,&quot; says Lt. Col.Mohamed Nasser, commander of the women's military school.   But who would train them? The Emirates' only qualifiedinstructors were men, and that was unthinkable. The Emiratessought U.S. help, and Fort Bragg responded with its firstall-women technical assistance field team. Such teams act asadvisers to allied armies. The U.S. Army chose 10 women whorepresented a wide range of specialties and a depth ofmilitary experience. Their average length of service is 14years. Their mission: to run a basic training course, thenteach some of the new soldiers to become trainers in theirturn.   But first, the U.S. soldiers had to learn a thing or two.Capt. Borum's first reaction to her new assignment as theteam's executive officer was &quot;United Arab where?&quot; recalls the38-year-old military police officer from Nashville, Tenn. &quot;Iwent straight to the library to read everything I could getmy hands on.&quot; What she read worried her. &quot;I was apprehensiveabout how we'd fit in,&quot; she says.   After the U.S. soldiers arrived in October, each spent twodays living with an Emirates family so they could experiencethe culture. &quot;I worried they'd see me as a Western womaninvading their home and challenging their ways,&quot; says Capt.Borum. Instead, she found herself an honored guest, feastingon camel meat (&quot;sweet and sort of greasy&quot;) and trying on aburka (&quot;a weird feeling -- like I was trying to hide fromsomebody&quot;).   Meantime, the 50,000-man Emirates army was seeking femalerecruits. About 1,200 volunteered. Hessa al-Khaledi, a civilengineer and women's activist, selected the recruits, basedon criteria including education, fitness and motivation. Atthe same time, Ms. al-Khaledi was holding meetings withMuslim conservatives to calm their fears. Among her points:One of Islam's storied warriors, Khawla bint alAzwar, was awoman who fought at the side of the Prophet Mohammed. Theacademy is named after her.   In early December, Capt. Borum and her colleaguesconfronted 74 shy Arabian recruits, most of whom had neverspent a night away from home. &quot;At first, I had to go aroundlifting their chins to get them to look me in the eye,&quot; shesays.   Fifteen dropped out in the first weeks. Some hadn'texpected to encounter any men on the base, and couldn't dealwith the daily presence of the few male administrators.Others couldn't cope with the rigors of American-style basictraining. At first, a cadet would just flop on the ground inthe middle of a forced march and say, &quot;I'm not doing anymore.&quot;   &quot;Gulf women are kind of spoiled&quot; since the oil boom, saysMs. al-Khaledi. &quot;We have the maids, the luxury life. Somecouldn't give it up.&quot;   The American and Arab women all lived on base, but not inthe same barracks. In time, they learned from each other. TheAmericans spent a long time explaining the concept ofmilitary discipline. The recruits, meantime, taught theAmericans a different kind of leadership. &quot;The drillsergeants, yelling at them to get into formation or get inthe barracks, were just about scaring these poor women todeath,&quot; says the American commander, Maj. Janis Karpinski.&quot;American recruits expect that to happen -- they've seen allthe movies.&quot;   The sergeants discovered that lavishly praising the oneswho got it right, rather than excoriating the ones who got itwrong, was the best way to get improved performance. &quot;Theyare raised to be pleasers,&quot; says Capt. Borum, &quot;so we tried tobecome the people they wanted to please.&quot;   None of the recruits, who ranged in age from 17 to 31, hadbeen physically active. &quot;There were some itty bitty girls andsome really heavy ones,&quot; says First Sgt. Brenda Marvin. Herinitial reaction was to drastically revise her fitnesstargets. But as the five-month course progressed, thesergeant found herself readjusting the standards upwardagain. One recruit lost 44 pounds; all soon were coping withforced marches and 100 push-ups a day.   Every rule of Islam was observed. During the month ofRamadan, when Muslims fast from dawn to sunset, Maj.Karpinski adjusted the training schedule so the cadets couldrest from noon until evening, then work for a few hours afterthey'd eaten. She joined the troops in fasting. &quot;I wantedthem to see I was supporting them and to know exactly howthey felt,&quot; she says. &quot;When they said, `We can't run,' Icould say yes you can, because we can.&quot;   As the training continued toward May, &quot;We saw thismetamorphosis take place,&quot; says Maj. Karpinski. &quot;In the last30 days I never saw these women but their shoulders weresquared, their heads tall.&quot; By then, she says, they knew theycould do anything they were asked to do.   While proud of their daughters, some families are stillgetting used to the changes. Says Ms. Dawish: &quot;They told meI'd changed too many things, from the way I walk to the way Iact with them. Some they liked, some no.&quot;   Lt. Col. Nasser admits to some misgivings. &quot;If we had abigger population, I'd rather see women stay at home,&quot; hesays. But the colonel also admits he has had to revise hisopinions about women's capabilities. When the Americantrainers first presented him with the cadets' shootingscores, he doubted the data. &quot;When I see results of 38 out of40 I have to be surprised.&quot; He insisted on taking the womento a rifle range used by the male cadets to see if theirresults matched. They did.   Next month, all but one of the first 10 Americans will gohome and six new ones will arrive. But the new group will beadvisers, not trainers; the training will be done by 25 ofthe newly trained Emirates women. Two of the top cadets,including Ms. Dawish, will be going to Sandhurst, the Britishmilitary academy, for officer training. The rest are trainingin protective services -- they'll become bodyguards forfemale members of the ruling families -- or studying militaryintelligence. The idea is that the women, like their Americancounterparts, will mainly fill specialist jobs, not combatroles. &quot;Why not a pilot or a missile operator?&quot; asks Lt. Col.Mohamed Mehrizy, an officer with the Emirates chief of staff.   Why not indeed, says Capt. Borum. &quot;We underestimatedthem,&quot; she says. &quot;There is nothing these women can't do.Nothing at all.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
