The bank holding company had been paying 22 cents quarterly on the common stock.    At their November meeting, an official said, directors will consider whether to pay a fourth-quarter dividend.    Dividends on preferred shares are being continued on an uninterrupted basis. The third-quarter dividend on the preferred was paid earlier this month, and directors voted a regular quarterly dividend of 53.125 cents payable Nov. 13, to preferred stock of record Nov. 5.    Earlier this month the board demanded the resignation of Gerald R. Mock, chairman, president and chief executive officer. He was replaced by Clifford A. Barton, a director, pending selection of a permanent successor.    The company said the loss-reserve addition followed a review of its loan portfolio, triggered by the big additions to loan-loss reserves by many major banks. The addition covered a variety of questionable commercial and industrial loans, and didn't reflect problems with loans in any one industry, the company said.    The second-quarter loss contrasted with profit of $1.3 million, or 41 cents a share, a year earlier.    Despite the loss, the company has a strong balance sheet, an official said. He said capital equals 8.95% of assets, sharply higher than the minimum required 5.5%.    USBancorp, with total assets of $773.8 million, operates 33 branches in western Pennsylvania. </TEXT></DOC>
