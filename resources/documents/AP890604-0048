The 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries wasscheduled to open a formal meeting Monday to plan its pricing andproduction strategy for the rest of the year.   Analysts expect OPEC to set a new elevated production output capof 19.5 million or 20 million barrels a day, a level that wouldlikely hold prices at current levels and do little to gasolineprices at the pump.   Khomeini's death Saturday raised questions about the cartel'swork schedule. Iran, a large crude oil producer, is a leadingmember of the organization.   Gholamreza Aqazadeh, the Iranian oil chief, said governmentofficials were not requiring that he return to Iran. But he said hewanted to return ``to be with my people in Iran and participate inthe funeral ceremony.''   He said the other oil ministers were discussing the situation.   ``I think due to the circumstances, the conference will endsooner than expected,'' he said through an interpreter.   OPEC officials began preliminary discussions Friday on pricingand production goals for the last six months of the year. OnSunday, the ministers met privately in their rooms to try toarrange a deal.   ``We still have a way to go,'' said Libyan Oil Minister FawziShakshuki.   The ministers appear ready to boost their production ceiling,now at 18.5 million barrels a day, with a target price of $18 abarrel.   Aqazadeh said he expected demand for OPEC oil to grow about 1million barrels a day in the last six months of the year, implyingthe cartel might lift its ceiling to at least 19.5 million barrelsdaily.   He said deciding how the increase should be distributed amongthe producers ``is our main problem.'' He declined to elaborate,saying only, ``I think we will reach an agreement.''   Oil prices have soared since the ministers late last yearslashed output in the first six months of 1989. The average priceof a basket of seven crudes monitored by OPEC is nearly $17.70 abarrel, more than 43 percent higher than in late November.   OPEC members are: Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran,Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United ArabEmirates and Venezuela.</TEXT></DOC>
