The stake was bought by the Western Australian State Government Insurance Commission, which last week paid 206 million dollars for some of Mr. Holmes a Court's Perth properties.    Alan Newman, chief general manager of Bell Group Ltd., the major shareholder in Bell Resources, said Bell Resources sold about 39 million BHP shares for an amount that was based on their average market price over the past two days. In Australian trading yesterday, BHP, which is the nation's largest company, fell six cents (four U.S. cents), to 7.24 dollars ($4.97).    Bell Resources has acquired about 30% of BHP in recent years through takeover bids and has agreed with BHP to maintain its stake at 30% unless it attempts a full takeover. The holding has fluctuated because of various options agreements entered into by Bell Resources. Mr. Newman said the sale was necessary to reduce Bell Resources' holding to below 30%. But it also helped Bell Resources build a &quot;war chest&quot; for possible takeover bids, he said.    The stock price of Mr. Holmes a Court's two major listed companies, Bell Group and Bell Resources, has taken a beating in the recent world market plunge because of investor worries that Mr. Holmes a Court faces a cash squeeze. Some analysts have speculated that Mr. Holmes a Court is seeking to acquire a large company in Australia or elsewhere that would provide a strong cash flow. Other analysts believe Mr. Holmes a Court might have to sell his multibillion-dollar assets to boost liquidity. Bell officials deny that a sale is needed.    As previously reported, a senior Bell official has said that Mr. Holmes a Court turned down recent offers for such stakes as his 9.6% holding in Texaco Inc. of the U.S. and 8% of Sears PLC, a British retailer that isn't related to the U.S. concern Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co. The official indicated that such assets could be sold if potential buyers offered higher prices. Although the Bell executive denied asset sales were necessary, he said, &quot;If somebody makes a realistic offer, we'd have to consider it.&quot;    Mr. Newman said the sale of the BHP shares to the Western Australian commission helped Bell get funds it had planned to raise last month through a one billion-dollar issue of Eurobonds convertible into BHP shares. The lead manager, Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., withdrew the issue following the stock-market crash.    &quot;With the cash we already had and the recent sales, we are very close to our target&quot; of raising a war chest for expansion, Mr. Newman said.    The state government of Western Australia, which is the base for many of the country's aggressive financiers, is actively supporting its businessmen. Last month, the government -- as well as Mr. Holmes a Court -- participated in a bailout of Rothwells Ltd., a Western Australian investment bank that experienced a run by depositors as the stock market crashed.    Australia's market fell more than 50% at its nadir, more than the declines on most other world markets.    Bell Resources shares rose 25 cents in heavy turnover yesterday, to close at 1.90 dollars prior to the announcement of the BHP sale. Bell Group climbed 35 cents, to 2.45 dollars.    Separately, Mr. Holmes a Court formally announced the sale of his 8.8% stake in John Fairfax Ltd., one of Australia's two major publishers.    J.N. Taylor Holdings Ltd., owned 34% by Bell Group, acquired 26.5 million shares in John Fairfax Ltd. earlier this year. The move sparked a 2.55 billion-dollar takeover bid for John Fairfax Ltd. in August by Warwick Fairfax, a member of the company's founding family.    Mr. Holmes a Court accepted the offer for his stake on the condition that he would acquire John Fairfax Ltd.'s daily business newspapers in Australia and New Zealand, a radio network and other assets for a total of 475 million dollars. A source close to Bell Group said this week that several media interests had approached Bell about buying those operations, which Bell has said it doesn't want to sell.    J.N. Taylor said it received 225 million dollars for its 8.8% stake in John Fairfax Ltd., leaving a profit before costs of 31 million dollars.    Warwick Fairfax has acquired more than 90% of John Fairfax Ltd. through the takeover bid and is seeking remaining shares outstanding before taking the company private. </TEXT></DOC>
