The May decline followed drops of 0.9% in April and 0.4%in March. Nevertheless, economists say the three-monthdecline, while reflecting continued weakness in the overalleconomy, doesn't necessarily foreshadow a recession.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The figures show some sign of economic weakness, but agood part of that is just a distortion {caused by} theweather,&quot; said Thomas Swanstrom, chief economist for SearsMerchandise Group in Chicago. He cited unusually cool weatherin certain regions, and concluded: &quot;I think the jury is stillout as to whether this is really some sign of economicweakness or if this is just some type of aberration.&quot;   Departing somewhat from Mr. Swanstrom's view, RosalindWells, chief economist for National Retail Federation, said,&quot;It is hard to keep blaming it {the drop} on the weather. Theweakness is pretty widespread . . . which indicates anoverall weakening in the economy.&quot;   Analyst did agree that the decline indicates consumershave become more cautious in the past few months due to aslowdown in employment growth and a slump in home sales andprices.   May's drop in sales, just as the April decline, waswidespread with declines in all sales categories exceptapparel.   Auto sales fell 0.6% in May compared with a 1.6% declinein April. Hardware and building material purchases tumbled4.2% after diving 3.2% in April. Furniture sales dropped 1.1%after rising 0.5% the month before. Sales at generalmerchandise department stores fell 1% after declining 2.1% inApril. However, apparel sales jumped 2.4% after falling alike percentage a month earlier.   Excluding auto sales, which tend to vary widely from monthto month, retail sales were down 0.8% in May after dropping0.7% in April.   But some analysts were skeptical that the overall Maysales decline was as sharp as the department figures suggest.&quot;I would not be surprised if the revised numbers aren't quiteas bad as these figures indicate,&quot; said Ms. Wells.   She also suggested that sales may rise later this yearcompared with the May figures. &quot;It is not a glowing salesreport, and it should be taken seriously. . . . But I expectretail sales to improve as the year goes on,&quot; she said.   Retail purchases totaled $146.84 billion in May afteradjusting for seasonal flucuations, compared with total salesof $147.93 billion in April.   The department's estimates are based on a relatively smallsample of reports and frequently are revised significantly asmore data are collected. The numbers exclude spending onservices, which account for a large portion of consumeroutlays. But retail sales account for about one-third of thecountry's economic activity, and thus those figures areclosely watched by economists.</TEXT></DOC>
