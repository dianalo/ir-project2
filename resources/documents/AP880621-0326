IBM pulled out all the stops, including filling a New York stagewith actors who extolled the new computers in skits set in a bank,hospital and toy factory.   Advertising for the AS-400 computers will include networktelevision commercials featuring Alan Alda and the rest of the gangfrom ``MASH.''   The AS-400 series is the heir to the System 36 and System 38,the biggest-selling computers ever above the ranks of personalcomputers, with roughly 300,000 installed worldwide.   IBM's stock, which has languished for months, rose $3.12{ ashare to $120.25 a share in consolidated New York Stock Exchangetrading. It was not clear how much of the rise was the result ofthe computer announcement.   IBM said the Application System-400 was the result of its mostextensive hardware and software undertaking.   In a delicate software compromise, a team based in Rochester,Minn., built the AS-400 so it can run programs written for eitherof the predecessor machines, overcoming a troubling schism in themiddle of its mid-range product line.   ``IBM has a real family now, and they haven't had anything likethis for a long time,'' said Sonny Monosson, editor of a newslettercalled Monosson on DEC.   Although press speculation before the announcement focused onIBM's competition with Digital Equipment Corp., analysts saidexisting IBM customers would be the most important and easiestmarket for the six models of the AS-400.   If IBM replaced every one of the existing System 36, 38 andolder System 34 machines with an AS-400 at an average of $75,000,it could generate $22 billion in revenue, said Stephen Cohen, ananalyst for Gartner Securities Corp.   Realistically, Cohen said he expects IBM to bring in $800million this year by selling 8,000 of the computers. Next year'ssales could total 20,000, he said.   IBM said its biggest target for the AS-400 is small andmedium-sized businesses, which it called ``the biggest,fastest-growing segment of the world's economy.''   But the company is also hoping to place computers in thedepartments of big companies _ a market where it has less of agrasp and will face tougher competition from Digital Equipment Corp.   Still, the AS-400's ability to run the same programs across awide range of machines helps IBM in its battle with Digital.   ``They're offering everything that DEC offers. I think they'regoing to prevent DEC from weaning away IBM customers,'' Monossonsaid.   In addition to Digital, IBM faces competition from suchcompanies as Hewlett-Packard Co., NCR Corp., Wang LaboratoriesInc., Altos Computer Systems and various European and Japanesecompetitors.   IBM chose the longest day of the year for its eight-hourprogram, part of which was televised by satellite to more than100,000 people across the United States in what the company saidmay have been the biggest private business broadcast ever. Another70,000 people in other countries attended briefings.   Although much information about the AS-400 computers had leakedout, several observers said they were surprised and impressed bythe breadth of the product line. The top of the line is as powerfulas IBM's 4381 mainframe computers.   By the early 1990s IBM expects to have built models of theAS-400 that will be as powerful as the lower rungs of its 3090series, its biggest mainframe computers.   Some analysts had expected IBM to introduce some of the modelsunder the name AS-200, but the company decided to unify all of themunder the AS-400 name.   IBM said all six of the computers will be available worldwide inAugust. That is an unusually short lag that ensures the machineswill have time to make a big difference in IBM's 1988 revenue.   Also unusual is the amount of software that will be availableimmediately _ a crucial consideration for businesses that rely onstandard packages of programs.   IBM and more than 130 cooperating companies announced more than1,000 software packages in such fields as retailing, manufacturing,finance, health, insurance and education.   In a change of strategy, IBM worked closely with othercompanies, not only on software but on the design of the computers,which was based on extensive consultation with customers.   ``We can't go it alone anymore,'' said Terry Lautenbach, generalmanager of IBM United States.   In a sign of IBM's dependence on others, 81 percent of theAS-400 models will be placed with users not by IBM, but by partnercompanies known as value-added resellers that add special features,such as customized software.   Including operating system software and data storage devices,prices of the new computers will range from about $40,000 to morethan $1 million.   About six in 10 of the new computers will be sold outside theUnited States.</TEXT></DOC>
