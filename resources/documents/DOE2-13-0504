Seventy-seven percent ofpatients had PBI and of these, 22% developed brain metastases after amedian time of 11 months post treatment. The brain was the apparent uniqueinitial site of relapse in 10% of PBI cases but more commonly brain relapsewas preceded or accompanied by failure at other sites, especially thechest. Brain metastases were the greatest cause of morbidity in 50% ofPBI failures. Twelve of 14 PBI patients alive 2 years after treatmenthad oncologic, neurologic, and neuropsychological evaluation, and brainCT. All long-term survivors were capable of self care and none fulfilleddiagnostic criteria for dementia, with three borderline cases. One thirdhad pretreatment neurologic dysfunction and two thirds post treatmentneurologic symptoms, most commonly recent memory loss. Fifty percenthad subtle motor findings. Intellectual functioning was at the 38th percentilewith most patients having an unskilled occupational history. Neuropsychologicimpairment ratings were borderline in three cases and definitely impairedin seven cases. CT scans showed brain atrophy in all cases with mildprogression in those having a pre-treatment baseline. Periventricularand subcortical low density lesions identical to the CT appearance ofsubcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy were seen in 82% of posttreatmentCT studies, and lacunar infarcts in 54%. Neuropsychologic impairmentscores and the extent of CT periventricular low density lesions werestrongly associated.</TEXT></DOC>
