Darius N. Keaton, 62 years old, of Monterey, Calif., pleaded guilty to two felony counts in Manhattan federal court on Friday. The pleas came 4 1/2 years after Mr. Keaton settled, without admitting wrongdoing, related civil charges by the Securities and Exchange Commission.    In the SEC case, the government charged eight foreign investors with insider trading in Santa Fe stock and stock options in September 1981, shortly before the Alhambra, Calif.-based oil-exploration company was acquired by Kuwait Petroleum Corp. The SEC had charged Mr. Keaton tipped off a Jordanian oil consultant, Costandi Nasser, about the impending deal. Mr. Nasser, in turn, was charged with tipping off the seven others.    Mr. Keaton, during his plea Friday before federal Judge Whitman Knapp, admitted that he used inside information but didn't admit to giving information to the others named in the case, as originally alleged in the 18-count indictment filed in January 1986.    Milton Gould, an attorney for Mr. Keaton, said, &quot;Originally it was supposed to be a tipping case. The government has dropped that charge. He has pleaded guilty to one count of using inside information and one count of failing to file requisite forms. All of his profits have been turned over to the SEC, and he has also settled in the stockholders' suit. He got a huge financial loss on the transaction. He has made a mistake, he's sorry, and he's paid for it.&quot;    Mr. Keaton bought 10,000 Santa Fe shares himself before the public announcement of the takeover. In settling the earlier SEC charges, the former director gave up more than $300,000 representing illegal trading profits.    Mr. Keaton faces as much as five years in prison on each of the counts to which he pleaded -- failing to report a change in stock ownership to the SEC and wire fraud. He also faces $11,000 in fines.    Judge Knapp set sentencing for June 1.    Mr. Nasser and the seven other foreign investors agreed in February 1986 to give up $7.8 million in illegal profits. Mr. Nasser was later indicted, in July 1986, on 16 criminal counts. That indictment is still outstanding. </TEXT></DOC>
