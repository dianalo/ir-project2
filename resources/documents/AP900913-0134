Souter firmlyrefused to discuss his views on abortion Thursday as the SenateJudiciary Committee opened confirmation hearings. Democratspromised to continue pressing him on that and other controversialissues.   Souter told senators it would be inappropriate for him todiscuss such a hotly contested constitutional matter as abortion,though he said he accepted the constitutional right of privacy onwhich the Supreme Court based its abortion-legalizing 1973decision, Roe vs. Wade.   The New Hampshire judge, nominated by President Bush to be thecourt's 105th justice, spoke slowly and somberly in the crowdedSenate hearing room of the position he called ``the greatestresponsibility that any judge in our republic can undertake.''   The court has been deeply divided in recent years with 5-4rulings on such contentious issues such as abortion and civilrights, and conservatives are hoping that Souter will help anchorthe court firmly on the right.   ``If the Senate of the United States believes it is right toconfirm my nomination, then I will accept those responsibilities asobligations to all of the people of the United States whose liveswill be affected by my stewardship of the Constitution,'' Soutersaid.   Committee chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del., then began the longprocess in which Souter would confront questions from all 14committee members.   Biden engaged Souter in a dialogue about the right of privacy,which although not specifically mentioned in the Constitution hasbeen recognized by the Supreme Court since a 1965 decision calledGriswold vs. Connecticut.   At one point, Souter talked about a need for the Supreme Courtto follow its own precedents - stating that past decisions shouldbe overturned only after careful consideration.   ``The first question is whether the prior decision was wrong,''he said. And if the court does determine its previous ruling wasincorrect, he added, it should measure ``the degree and kind ofreliance placed upon'' the ruling and the ``cost of overruling''it.   Souter began his testimony after sitting quietly for two hourswhile senators made opening statements.   He proved an attentive and respectful witness, though hardlydevoid of humor.   When one senator, worried about his questioning time expiring,cut Souter's response to a question short, the nominee quipped,``You're going to turn me into a laconic Yankee if you keep doingthat.''   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., questioned the nominee closelyabout positions he took while New Hampshire's attorney general and,before that, as an assistant in the attorney general's office.   Kennedy focused on cases in which the state defended a literacytest for prospective voters and resisted federal regulationsseeking information about hiring in state government.   In both instances, Souter emphasized, he was ``acting as anadvocate'' and ``representing a client.'' He said both positionswere tenable at the time, in the 1970s.   Earlier, Souter said he would view his Supreme Court service asa responsibility ``to make the promises of the Constitution areality for our time and to preserve that Constitution for thegenerations that will follow us.''   Drawing battle lines quickly, Democrats advised him to ``openfor us the window into your mind'' while Republicans told him tokeep his own counsel in facing sensitive questions.   ``The burden of proof is on you,'' Biden told him. ``We have aright to know, and a duty to discover, precisely what you ... thinkabout the great constitutional issues of our time.''   He urged Souter, ``Open for us the window into your mind. Andgive us a little bit of a glimpse into your heart.''   Biden and the committee's two other leading liberals, Kennedyand Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, asked Souter to discuss candidly hisviews of key issues on which the Supreme Court is closely divided.   But Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, the committee'sranking Republican, said his colleagues had no right ``to questiona nominee about how he or she would decide a particular case. It isinappropriate.''   Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., added, ``Overly explicit questionsare not only unwise but, I believe, impermissible.''   Reminding Souter that federal judges are ethically bound not topublicly discuss matters that are, or may be, before any court,Simpson gave the judge some Western advice: ``Sit deep in thesaddle.''   Kennedy said little in Souter's record as a state judge andattorney general in New Hampshire ``demonstrates real solicitudefor the rights of those who are weakest and most powerless in oursociety.''   ``It is the responsibility of this committee to find out whetherJudge Souter is committed to these rights and other basic valuesenshrined in the Constitution,'' Kennedy said. ``That is why thesehearings ... are so important.''   But Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, urged the nominee to ``stand yourground when you sincerely believe you are being asked for answersyou clearly cannot properly provide.''   The hearing's opening session was interrupted briefly when 12people - six men and six women - stood and shouted in protest. ``Hewill kill women,'' shouted one.   The demonstrators, who said they were members of a gay rightsgroup, were hustled from the cavernous hearing room by police. Theywere arrested and charged with disrupting a congressional hearing.   ``Welcome to Washington, judge,'' Biden told Souter after theoutburst.   Souter, 50, was nominated by President Bush on July 23, threedays after Justice William J. Brennan retired from the nation'shighest court.   Although he wrote more than 200 opinions in his seven years onthe New Hampshire Supreme Court, Souter has had few, if any,occasions to write about such divisive issues as abortion, civilrights and church-state relations.   Souter, who spent more than a week last month paying courtesycalls to the senators who will decide his nomination's fate, wasformally introduced to the committee by Republican New HampshireSens. Gordon Humphrey and Warren Rudman.   Both defended his ascetic lifestyle.   ``The elegant pundits here inside the beltway think David Soutermay not be quite up to the big time because he drives a clunky oldcar, because he believes in conserving energy by not mowing hislawn until it begins to block his view when he looks out hiswindow,'' Humphrey said as Souter smiled.   ``I believe you'll find David Souter to be as smart as anyone inthis city.''</TEXT></DOC>
