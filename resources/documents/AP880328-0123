Richard Gephardt quit the Democratic presidential racetoday, a victim of mounting losses in the seven weeks since he wonthe lead-off Iowa caucuses. Rival Jesse Jackson, on the rise with avictory in Michigan, said he expects the party to embrace him asits nominee if he wins the most pre-convention delegates.   Gephardt, who declared his candidacy in February 1987 andactually began campaigning more than a year earlier, said at aCapitol Hill news conference, ``It's time to end a presidentialcampaign.''   He said he would file for re-election to his House seat onTuesday ``to continue my fight for the people whose concerns havebeen at the heart of this campaign.''   The Missouri congressman noted that it is often said that anopera isn't over ``until the fat lady sings.'' Referring to hisdistant third-place finish in the Michigan caucuses, he said,``Last Saturday in Michigan, I think I heard her walking to themicrophone.''   He ranked fourth among the Democratic contenders in delegates tothe national convention.   On the eve of Tuesday's Connecticut primary, Vice PresidentGeorge Bush, who grew up in that state and is heavily favored towin, set off today on a three-day Wisconsin campaign swing.</TEXT><HEAD>EMBARGOED for release at 4 p.m. EST</HEAD><TEXT>      Bush's one-time foe, Jack Kemp, endorsed the vice president,saying ``George Bush is going to be the nominee of the RepublicanParty and he has earned that nomination.'' Kemp said the GOP mustrally around Bush to avoid a Democratic win in November, which hesaid would lead to a decline ``every bit as steep and severe asunder Jimmy Carter.''</TEXT><HEAD>End EMBARGOED material</HEAD><TEXT>      Bush, the overwhelming GOP front-runner, wasn't likely to runinto either of his remaining rivals in Wisconsin, which holds itsprimary a week from Tuesday. Bob Dole, who has all but conceded thenomination, was in Washington today, giving a speech on the futureof the Republican Party. And Pat Robertson was taking a week-longvacation.   Jackson, on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America,'' said today, ``Ifat the end of California, we have the most popular votes and themost delegate votes, becoming the nominee is logical and proper.''   He questioned the idea that party leaders might ignore hisdelegate strength at the convention and give the nomination toanother Democratic candidate.   ``They would not have given me the nomination; I would haveearned it from the people,'' Jackson said. ``There is no smallgroup. No electoral college that can give. ... If so, why even havea primary? Why not just let the small group choose candidates inthe first place?   ``I don't believe in collecting a group of favorite sons, andthen selecting one, the people elect what's left,'' he said.   Jackson said if he wins the nomination through the Democraticprocess, ``I expect the party to embrace me and to embrace thoseprinciples.''   Rival Michael Dukakis was seeking to come back with a win on hisNew England home turf. Jackson was campaigning in Connecticut againtoday. But Dukakis, the governor of neighboring Massachusetts, haswon every state in New England so far and was expected to do wellin the state.   With returns from 94 percent of the voting sites in Michigan,Jackson had 55 percent to 28 percent for Dukakis. Gephardt had 13percent; Sen. Paul Simon had 2 percent, as did Sen. Albert Gore Jr.The remaining returns were expected later today.   The Michigan victory put Jackson within striking distance ofDukakis in the national delegate count, although the Massachusettsgovernor still clung to a narrow lead. The latest AP delegate countput Dukakis at 603.55 to Jackson's 597.55. Tennessee Sen. AlbertGore Jr. had 362.8, Sen. Paul Simon 171.5, Gephardt 167 anduncommitted 362.6.   Some of the Democratic candidates were gathering for a forum inNew York tonight. But Dukakis was not expected, and Gephardt mightnot be a candidate by then.   Dukakis, who before Michigan had been seeking to positionhimself as the inevitable Democratic nominee, was talking insteadabout a long fight to the finish.   ``This race is only half over,'' he said Sunday at a Greekfestival in New Haven. ``Anyone that thinks that this race is overor even that it's narrowed down to a two-person or a three-personrace doesn't understand the unpredictability of American politics.... There are no front-runners.''   That was fine by Gore and Simon. The Tennessee senator was inConnecticut on Sunday, suggesting Dukakis' disappointing finishkept the race ``wide open'' _ to his benefit.   ``We're building momentum steadily. ... We're gaining speed,''Gore said after a speech at an Italian-American club in theindustrial city of Derby. ``This race has a long way to go. It iswide open, even more so after the results in Michigan.''   Simon also suggested _ as he has for some time _ that the racewas still fluid, and no nominee would emerge before the DemocraticNational Convention in July. The Illinois senator, who came awaywith only 2 percent of the vote in Michigan, has said he needs astrong showing in Wisconsin to carry on.   A statewide poll in today's Milwaukee Sentinel suggested Jacksonand Dukakis were in a dead heat in the state.   Another poll suggested Dukakis was the clear favorite in NewYork, which holds its primary on April 19.   The weekend wasn't a complete loss for Dukakis. He won precinctcaucuses in North Dakota, and he edged out Gephardt in Iowa'scounty conventions, the latest step in that state's complicateddelegate-selection process.</TEXT></DOC>
