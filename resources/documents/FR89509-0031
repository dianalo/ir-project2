The proposed Consent Order has been placed on the public record for sixty(60) days for receipt of comments by interested persons. Comments receivedduring this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60)days, the Commission will again review the Agreement and the comments received,and will decide whether it should withdraw from the Agreement and takeother appropriate action or make final the proposed Order contained inthe Agreement. This matter concerns advertisements for An-Mar's tanning devices whichuse lamps that emit ultraviolet (UV) radiation to cause tanning of theuser's skin. The Commission's Complaint in this matter charges An-Mar with disseminatingadvertisements containing false and unsubstantiated representations regardingthe health benefits of its tanning devices. According to the Complaint,advertisements for An-Mar's tanning devices falsely claimed that the tanningdevices have a positive and stabilizing effect on metabolism, respirationand blood formation, and that tanning increases power of resistance andstamina. Also, according to the Complaint, the advertisements imply that the devicesdo not pose risks of harmful side effects associated with exposure to thesun's radiation, and that the devices may be used safely without protectiveeye wear. The Complaint alleges that these claims are, in fact, false,and that An-Mar's tanning devices impart no health benefits, cannot beused without risk of any harmful side effects, and cannot be used safelywithout protective eye wear. The Complaint also alleges that the advertisements contained false representationsthat An-Mar had a reasonable basis for the claims that its devices imparthealth benefits, can be used without the risk of any harmful side effectsassociated with the sun, and can be used safely without protective eyewear. In fact, An-Mar did not have a reasonable basis for these representations.The Consent Order contains provisions designed to remedy the advertisingviolations charged, as well as to prevent An-Mar from engaging in similaracts and practices in the future. Part I of the Order prohibits An-Marfrom misrepresenting, directly or by implication, that use of its devicesresults in health benefits, that its devices do not pose a risk of theharmful side effects associated with the sun's radiation, and that itsdevices can be used safely without protective eye wear. Part II of the Order allows An-Mar to run advertisements showing modelsusing the devices without protective eye wear, or wearing what appear tobe ordinary sunglasses, as long as the advertisements also warn the buyerto wear protective eye wear. Part III of the Order requires that for one year, An-Mar include in alladvertisements and promotional materials a notice statement alerting usersto read the mandatory Food and Drug Administration warning label foundon all tanning devices for important information on potential eye injury,skin cancer, skin aging and photosensitive reactions. Part IV of the Order requires that commencing one year after the date ofservice of this Order, An-Mar include a notice statement in any advertisementmaking a claim that its tanning devices are safe or safer than other devicesor methods of tanning, or that the devices have health benefits. The statementalerts users to read the mandatory FDA warning label for important informationon potential eye injury, skin cancer, skin aging and photosensitive reactions.Part V of the Order requires An-Mar to have reliable and competent scientificevidence to support any health or safety representation contained in anadvertisement. Part VI of the Order requires An-Mar to retain all substantiation An-Marrelies on for its advertisements for a period of three (3) years. Part VII of the Order requires An-Mar to send a copy of the Order to eachof its current dealers, distributors and purchasers or lessees for commercialuse, such as health clubs, tanning salons, beauty salons, catalogue houses,and tanning device retailers. Parts VIII through XII of the Order are standard Order provisions requiringAn-Mar to retain certain business records, report to the Commission certaincorporate changes, and provide a report to the Commission on An-Mar's compliancewith the provisions of the Order. The purpose of this Analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposedOrder. It is not intended to constitute an official interpretation of theAgreement and proposed Order or to modify in any way their terms.<ITAG tagnum="6">Benjamin I.
