As an ongoing effort in this direction, development ofcomputer simulated models for the system was initiated in September,1985. It was decided to utilize Dravo's `MINEVENT' computer program forthis purpose. Accordingly, initial computer models of the mine's ventilationsystem have been developed for various modes of operation. Specifically,they include: Simulation of the current ventilation system, and Simulationof the designed ventilation system for modes: mine construction mode/shift,waste storage mode/shift, and air reversal mode. 5 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
