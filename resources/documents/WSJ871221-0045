But most predict much slower growth early next year, and a majority also anticipate lower interest rates. &quot;I'm expecting a slowdown because of the shock to lending and spending that will come out of the crash,&quot; says Neal M. Soss, managing director and chief economist at First Boston Corp.    According to the average estimate of the 17 analysts, the economy is growing at a 3% annual rate this quarter, after adjusting for inflation. Their average forecast for next year's first quarter is that economic growth will slow to a 1.5% pace. Only two of the 17 -- Irwin L. Kellner of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. and H. Erich Heinemann of Moseley Securities -- foresee the start of a recession by next March.    One reason so many analysts expect continued growth is the unexpected strength of business activity prior to Oct. 19. &quot;The economy's pre-crash strength provides reasonable assurance we won't have a recession anytime soon even though consumer spending will slow,&quot; says Lyle Gramley, a former Federal Reserve Board governor who now is chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association of America.    Also, federal income tax cuts scheduled to go into effect next year should help stimulate the economy, says Alan Reynolds, chief economist of Polyconomics Inc., a Morristown, N.J., consulting firm. &quot;There is a lot of income being shuffled from this year's fourth quarter into next year's first quarter&quot; to take advantage of lower tax rates, he says, adding, &quot;I'm expecting a few checks myself in January, which I've deliberately deferred from this year.&quot;    Hopes for lower interest rates surged last week as oil prices fell sharply, bolstering optimism about prospects for keeping inflation under control. Bond prices rose especially sharply on Friday, partly reflecting further declines in oil prices, a stronger dollar, and comments by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan. Mr. Greenspan said October's rise in the nation's trade deficit to a record $17.6 billion was an &quot;aberration&quot; that probably will be reversed soon.    Prices of actively traded long-term Treasury bonds soared Friday by 2 1/2 points, or $25 for each $1,000 face amount of bonds. Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds posted its biggest one-day gain since Oct. 22. For the week, long-term Treasury issues rose about 5 5/8 points. As of late Friday, the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds had dropped to 8.90% from 9.47% the previous week. That was the first time the yield was below 9% in nearly a month.    &quot;Greenspan's comments helped start the rally going&quot; on Friday, said Jon Corzine, a partner at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. &quot;There is a strong bullish undertone to the market.&quot;    The explosive rally also was fueled by declines in the price of gold and other commodities that are watched closely as harbingers of inflation. If inflation remains subdued and the economy weakens early next year, the Federal Reserve will face intense pressure to ease credit. Some analysts already accuse the Fed of having adopted an overly tight credit policy this year.    Several other factors were important in last week's enormous rally. Traders cited growing speculation that Congress will adjourn without approving an increase in the government's authorization to issue new long-term bonds, thus giving the bond markets a temporary respite from the Treasury's huge borrowing needs.    Also, rumors are spreading that former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker will be asked by the Reagan administration to head a new commission to work on cutting the budget deficit. Although few analysts expect any progress until after the elections, some say appointing Mr. Volcker to a special commission would help inspire confidence among investors and provide the bond markets with an additional psychological lift.    Although most analysts expect sluggish growth early next year, individual estimates vary enormously. For example, David Levine, chief economist at Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co., predicts an economic &quot;boom&quot; in 1988. His forecast of a sizzling 6.3% growth rate for the first quarter, adjusted for inflation, is more than double that of anyone else in the Journal's survey. He also expects similar growth in the second and third quarters, leading to sharply higher interest rates.    Impossible, retort Mr. Levine's critics. They say consumer spending was beginning to slow even before the stock market fell apart, and that the stock market's gyrations will make shoppers even more cautious, especially for such items as cars and housing. Skeptics also point out that Mr. Levine has been forecasting a boom for more than two years. Mr. Levine cheerfully acknowledges he has been mistaken since late 1985 but says the tide finally appears to be turning.    At the other extreme is Mr. Heinemann of Moseley Securities, one of the two in the Journal survey to prophesy a recession. The slump, he says, &quot;will be the result of almost a full year of severe monetary restraint&quot; by the Federal Reserve. &quot;Money growth has been brought to a grinding halt.&quot;    Consumer spending &quot;is starting to go into reverse,&quot; Mr. Heinemann said. &quot;Inventories are building up. The economy is turning out a lot of goods, but we're not consuming them. And the jump in initial claims for unemployment insurance recently suggests that business may already be laying people off to bring production in line with sales.&quot; He predicts rates will rise in the short term but then fall &quot;substantially&quot; late in the first quarter or early in the second quarter. However, he expects the recession to be &quot;relatively shallow&quot; and to be over by the third quarter.    One of the few forecasts most analysts in the survey readily agreed with is that interest rates will remain exceptionally volatile. Yields on 30-year Treasury bonds this year have ranged from 7 1/2% during the first quarter to about 10.4% in mid-October.    That extraordinarily wide range &quot;could well be exceeded in 1988,&quot; says Mr. Soss of First Boston. His latest economic outlook report is entitled &quot;Seven Come Eleven.&quot; He predicts that Treasury bond yields could fall &quot;toward 7%&quot; in the first half and then lurch back up to &quot;perhaps 11% by year end.&quot;    ---   Friday's Market Activity   The massive bond rally Friday capped a weeklong surge that was the strongest in more than seven weeks. The rally proved once again the enormous importance of oil and commodity prices in the credit markets and provided analysts with another graphic reminder of the need to keep up with internal politics at the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.    The price of the latest 30-year Treasury bond soared Friday to 99 22/32 from 97 6/32 Thursday. As recently as Dec. 11, the issue was quoted at 94 2/32. Its yield dropped to 8.90% late Friday from 9.15% late Thursday.    Shearson Lehman's index of long-term Treasury bonds jumped 25.22 points Friday to close at 1256.11. It ended just below its high for the day of 1257.15. The low was 1234.39. That was the biggest increase since Oct. 22, when the index rose more than 32 1/2 points.    The government's latest 10-year notes were quoted late Friday at a price of 100 10/32 to yield 8.83%. On Thursday, the issue was quoted at 98 30/32, to yield 9.04%.    Most short-term interest rates also declined. The rate on the Treasury's latest three-month bill rate fell to 5.85% bid from 5.89%, while the latest six-month bill rate declined to 6.37% bid from 6.41%.    But the federal funds rate rose slightly. The funds rate, which is the rate on reserves that banks lend each other overnight, averaged nearly 6 3/4% Friday. That was up from Thursday's average of 6.67%.    Fed Chairman Greenspan's comments at a congressional hearing encouraged many analysts. Mr. Greenspan &quot;sent us a clear message that he is determined to keep inflation low, and that's exactly the message the bond markets have been waiting for,&quot; said Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist at Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. &quot;Greenspan indicated the Fed will restore the purchasing power of the dollar and will not be swayed by election-year pressures.&quot;    ---                      Economic Forecasts                      (Growth in percent)                                            1987      1988                                          FOURTH     FIRST                                         QUARTER   QUARTER Neal Soss, First Boston                     4.1       1.0 David A.
