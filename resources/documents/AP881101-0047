Because such medical news ``might send markets plummeting orrising _ it would have to be sorted out by good standards,'' thevice president said in an interview with The New York Times.   ``If I didn't feel good today I wouldn't feel I had to rush outand have a press conference about it.''   Doctors interviewed said the 64-year-old Bush is in excellenthealth. He runs two miles three or four times a week, has coffeeand fruit for breakfast, and keeps his weight at 195 pounds. He is6-foot-2.   Bush said he has had a few sleepless nights lately because he isworried about the election, but that he hates taking sleeping pills.   He also said he handles stress much better today than he did 20years ago, when he was a chronic worrier and suffered from twoulcers.   Bush's doctors said the vice president has a mild enlargement ofthe prostate gland but that they do not expect corrective surgeryto be necessary in the next four years.   In 1986, Bush had a basal cell skin cancer removed from hisface, but he has no symptoms of other cancers. He is allergic tobee stings but is receiving immunotherapy injections to stave offpotentially life-threatening allergic reactions.</TEXT></DOC>
