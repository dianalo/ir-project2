Loggers chopped down the trees. Farmers burned off the brush and pulled up the mangroves. The rains stripped away the exposed topsoil and carried it down to the bay. The silt smothered the coral. Fish died. Desperate fishermen lobbed homemade bombs into the water to blast remaining fish to the surface. Some blasted off their fingers and arms.    &quot;Life was hard,&quot; says fisherman Lorito Cereno. &quot;Our catch was so small we could barely eat three meals a day.&quot; &quot;Some of us didn't even have rubber thongs,&quot; adds Ponciano Lirazan.    The hillsides are still bare and rocky, but today Mr. Lirazan sports a pair of rubber thongs. Down by the water's edge, fisherman Juan Soliva has decorated his particle-board hut with Save-the-Mangrove posters. High in the boughs of a nearby tree, villagers have built a bamboo lookout for spotting fish poachers. And above the town, yellow corn-fields show stripes of dark green bean bushes -- a first stab at contour farming.    The changes are part of a World Bank project to breathe life into the central Philippines. It will cost $25 million over its five-year life -- a pittance by World Bank standards -- and it has raised eyebrows in Manila's bureaucratic circles.    As well it might. After decades of multimillion-dollar, big-equipment projects to clear jungle, lay down asphalt and displace villagers, the World Bank has a reputation as something of a scourge among biologists and social scientists. Around the world, bank critics cite project after project where the bank's beneficiaries might have been better off without the loans.    The bank isn't solely to blame. Its loans are channeled through Third World governments, and planners in capitals like Manila can be hopelessly out of touch with village reality.    In farming, for instance, the Philippine government has favored large-scale flatlands crops like sugar and corn, even though most farmers in places like Ronda live on hillsides. But Manila classifies hills as state-owned timberland, even though Ronda's hills are thickly populated and covered only with cornstalks and an occasional coconut tree. Because the land is state owned, the hill-dwellers can't get title and live in fear of being evicted.    They refuse to grow trees. Trees take 25 years to harvest. Every so often, government foresters truck in thousands of mahogany seedlings, and the villagers play along with the &quot;reforestation.&quot; When the trucks leave, they rip up the seedlings and replant their corn.    Likewise in fishing, agencies have dredged ports, financed boats, built ice plants, and sold bigger and better nets. The fishermen latch onto the equipment in the beginning, fish the water bare, and are left with the debt. The fish catch has been falling for years in the Philippines, but under former President Ferdinand Marcos officials covered it up. &quot;Back in 1981, it wasn't politically wise to admit there was overfishing,&quot; says Frederick Vande Vusse, a marine biologist on the World Bank program here.    Besides, nixing costly boats, ice plants and mahogany seedlings would have meant missing out on skim and bribes.    Donor nations also tend to prefer big projects. &quot;There is a kind of unwritten rule,&quot; Mr. Vande Vusse says. &quot;If it's money coming from a participating government, the legislative body of that country expects a significant percentage to come back.&quot; Whether they need them or not, farmers and fishermen get fertilizers and ice plants purchased in the donor countries. First World engineers get contracts, and First World consultants get fees. Government officials get rich.    Attitudes here started changing in the 1970s when Andrew Mercer, a British World Bank official, made aerial surveys of the central Philippines. He declared that much of the topsoil was gone and predicted disaster. In 1980, he started drawing up plans for the region. He included 25-year land-use contracts, the closest thing possible to a title deed on the government-owned &quot;timberlands,&quot; artificial reefs made of bamboo, contour plowing and other simple devices.    Convincing his peers in the development community was a slow process.    &quot;I had a fisheries guy from the Food and Agriculture Organization in my office, looking for all the traditional elements of a fishing project,&quot; recalls Mr. Vande Vusse, who worked with Mr. Mercer in the early years. &quot;Ice plants. Ports. Motors. Nets. He kept screaming at me, 'Where's the project? Where's the project?' He couldn't see how the World Bank was going to approve a loan that didn't have a lot of foreign costs.&quot;    When the funds finally came through, technicians moved in. They were required to live in the villages, often in palm-leaf huts without electricity. They were forbidden to hand out equipment unless the locals really wanted it. Convincing the villagers was slow work.    &quot;In the beginning, we believed the program was useless,&quot; says fisherman Sabas Bobier, who has seen many development technicians pass through Ronda, leaving plows, nets and problems in their wake. &quot;We thought the bamboo was just money thrown into the sea.&quot;    But the technicians ferried Mr. Bobier and others to another island, where an artificial reef had been in place long enough to become a fish spawning-ground. The men came back converts.    Now there are more than 7,000 artificial reefs near Ronda. Some mornings, out on the bay, the azure surface boils with fish. Fishermen no longer need bombs. Their diet has improved. Some have new nipapalm roofs on their houses.    &quot;Some even use {metal} sheet roofing,&quot; says Mr. Bobier. For a Ronda fisherman, a metal roof not only keeps a household dry, it can also catch rainwater. A fisherman with a metal roof doesn't have to paddle across the bay to get drinking water.    But the World Bank loan is only good for another year, and project managers fear the money will run out before the new ways take root. So they are looking for new loans. A parade of development agencies has passed though Ronda since 1986, sizing up the possibilities.    &quot;We haven't had a single taker,&quot; sighs Mr. Vande Vusse. &quot;Our project doesn't cost very much, but it's done exclusively with Filipinos, we don't need to buy anything overseas except a motorcycle or two. And that is the kiss of death.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
