The court also agreed to hear four other petitions that calledfor either an increase in compensation or asked for court guidanceon how relief should be distributed among victims of the world'sdeadliest industrial disaster.   The decision came two weeks after the Supreme Court announced asettlement with Union Carbide.   In February, the U.S.-based company agreed to pay damages of $470million to victims of the Dec. 3, 1984 leak of methyl isocyanatefrom the pesticide plant operated by Union Carbide's indiansubsidiary in Bhopal.   Union Carbide, whose headquarters are in Danbury, Conn., hasalready deposited the money with the court.   The key petition filed today challenged the Indian government'sauthority to represent the 3,300 people who died in the tragedy orthe estimated 20,000 others injured by the deadly gas.   Under a 1985 act, the Indian government was given sole authorityto represent all victims of the tragedy after hundreds of indian andU.S. lawyers said they would represent victims in separate cases.   ``I have a very strong case,'' said Charanlal Sahu, a Bhopalattorney who said he and his family were affected by exposure to thegas. ``The act goes against the Indian Constitution. The victimshave no confidence in the ability of the Union of India.''   ``You can't snatch away an individual's fundamental right to beheard in a court of law,'' he said. ``But the Indian government, bya stroke of a pen, became the sole representative of all thevictims.''   Chief Justice R.S. Pathak said he would hear Sahu's case.   ``There is urgency in the matter... It is a case involving thecountry's constitution,'' Pathak said.   A court official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said fourother petitions from two gas victims' associations and two humanrights lawyers may come up for hearings Friday.   ``We do not want to delay the matter any more,'' the officialsaid.   But Sahu said if the court agrees to give the petitions a fullhearing, it will take at least six months to reach any decisions.   One petition suggested the Indian government pay the differencebetween the $3 billion, for which the Indian government originallysued, and the $470 million settlement. Other petitions asked for anincrease in compensation as well as jobs for victims and theirfamilies.</TEXT></DOC>
