Bob Dole's plan ``sounds easy, but it isn'tdecisive.''   On the same day that President Reagan sent a $1.1 trillionbudget to Congress, Bush also claimed that Dole's fiscal policywould ``cut into Social Security and COLAs and reduce the checksfor our senior citizens.''   Bush elaborated on his budget proposal while predicting he wouldscore the most impressive victories in the Super Tuesday series ofRepublican Party primaries and caucuses in the South and borderstates.   He also said he will honor his commitment to take part intonight's GOP candidate debate here, despite Dole's withdrawal,because ``we're committed.''   During a heavy day of campaigning here and in Missouri, Bushalso said he didn't want to get into ``name-calling'' battles withDole, his closest competitor for the party's presidentialnomination.   Bush, in fact, did not name Dole when he told an audience inJoplin, Mo. that ``one candidate'' is supporting a budget freezeproposal that would provide only a 2 percent window of flexibilityon additional spending.   ``It sounds easy, but it isn't decisive,'' Bush said. ``It'sducking decisions about where you cut and where you add.'' He saidDole's ``across-the-board'' freeze would ``freeze in someoutrageous waste'' in spending programs.   The vice president said he is best suited to carry on Reagan'seconomic and foreign policy legacy, and asked voters help himfollow up the New Hampshire victory with a strong showing on March8.   While Bush continued his grass-roots style of campaigning,making an unscheduled stop at a truck stop in rural Missouri, hischief spokesman, Pete Teeley, said the vice president's campaignaides feel Bush is well positioned to make a strong showing in thenext series of primaries.   Bush sought to capitalize on Reagan's relative popularity in theSouth and border states, saying ``the president and I'' havebrought economic prosperity to the country. Bush did say, however,that some areas of the country missed out on the benefits of therecovery from the 1981-82 recession, and said he planned to dosomething about that if elected.   On his bitter battle with Dole, Bush said he did not want to getinto any direct confrontations with the Kansas Republican.   ``I don't respond to Bob Dole. I'm trying to stay on theissues.''   Asked in a local television interview whether he would continueto run negative commercials against Dole, Bush replied, ``He (Dole)called them comparative ads when they were all about me.''   Asked if he would support Dole if the Kansan won the nomination,Bush said,``I'd vote for him over any Democrat and I expect he'dvote for me over any Democrat.''   Bush said ``the next focused event, with the entire nation'sfocus, will be South Carolina'' which holds its presidentialprimary on Tuesday. And Teeley said that Bush will not try tocompete in Minnesota, which also holds its presidential contestnext week.   Addressing a large crowd in the atrium of the Loews AnatoleHotel here, Bush said ``there is no way you can become president ofthe United States by not doing well, if not winning, on SuperTuesday. I intend to win.''   Bush would seek to bring about a balanced budget by fiscal 1993by limiting the growth in expenditures to a growth in U.S. Treasuryreceipts ranging from 5 percent to 8 percent, and a 4 percentannual rate of inflation.   ``The question is, who is best qualified to get this deficitdown,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
