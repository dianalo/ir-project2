The Bundesbank yesterday called for interest-rate tenders on 28-day securities-repurchase agreements at a minimum rate of 3.5%, well below the 3.8% rate it had been asking since January. Market experts estimate that the actual rate to emerge from bidding today is likely to be closer to 3.6% or 3.65%. But they expect the Bundesbank to use later tenders to continue to push the rate lower, possibly to 3.3%.    The repurchase facility is the central bank's principal open-market means for refinancing the banking system with funds backed by securities. Yesterday's Bundesbank action signals broad declines in capital-market interest rates, and could lead to lower credit rates charged by commercial banks.    The West German move complements a recent lowering of short-term interest rates in Japan and a tightening of credit by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board. Those two steps were aimed at stabilizing exchange rates.    However, foreign-exchange traders said the Bundesbank's action didn't have any immediate effect on the currency market and that small interest-rate movements are unlikely to significantly outweigh other factors weakening the dollar, including the U.S. trade deficit.    Economists, meanwhile, don't expect the reduction in West German short-term interest rates to stimulate Europe's largest economy. West German gross national product figures are expected to show a decline in the first quarter from the last quarter of 1986. Rather than monetary measures, economists said, the nation could use deep tax reductions and other fiscal steps to regenerate an economy that is showing fatigue in its fifth year of recovery.    The central bank's announcement had been expected on West German capital markets since late last week. The central bank council last Thursday empowered the Bundesbank directors to cut the repurchase-agreement rate as much as one-half percentage point.    The Bundesbank implemented only part of the approved reduction yesterday. Analysts believe it opted to withhold a portion of the allowed reduction for a later date if the dollar shows signs of needing more support.    The reduction generated some speculation about a cut in West Germany's 3% discount rate before the end of this summer, though most analysts still don't believe such a move is imminent.    &quot;What we're seeing now is a first step towards what may lead toward a discount-rate cut,&quot; said the chief foreign-exchange trader for a bank in Frankfurt. &quot;But the Bundesbank will probably take its time. For now, they've clearly indicated that they're working to widen their interest-rate differential with the U.S.&quot;    Economists hold out the possibility of a discount-rate cut as long as West Germany enjoys near-zero inflation. But they have come to predict a 2% inflation rate by the end of the year. For many, that suggests that West Germany's interest rates could be heading back up by Christmas.    Indications yesterday were that few other European central banks would follow the Bundesbank in pushing interest rates down.    The Bank of France injected liquidity into the domestic money market through a securities-repurchase agreement at a rate of 7 3/4%, the level that has held since March 9. Meanwhile, the Swiss central bank has taken steps to deter a month-end liquidity shortage, banking sources said, but won't try to push rates down in response to the Bundesbank's action.    The Dutch central bank, however, is expected to announce tomorrow a reduction in the rate at which it lends funds in the money market to 5.1% or 5%, from 5.2%, banking sources said.    ---   Japanese Market Rates Fall   Special to The Wall Street Journal    TOKYO -- Japanese capital-market interest rates continued their recent decline, with the government's benchmark 10-year bond reaching a record high price on heavy volume.    The benchmark issue's yield dropped to 2.605% from 2.73% Monday. Other long-term and short-term rates also fell.    The decline in interest rates has been encouraged by the Japanese central bank, following Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's promise, during his recent visit to Washington, to adjust interest rates to help stabilize foreign-exchange rates. </TEXT></DOC>
