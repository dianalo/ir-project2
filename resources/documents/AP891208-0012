(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The conviction of a former Boeing Co.marketing executive sends a clear signal that the government won'ttolerate illegal trafficking of classified Pentagon documentswithin the defense industry, says the U.S. attorney whose officetried the case.   A U.S. District Court jury deliberated only two hours Thursdaybefore convicting Richard Lee Fowler on 39 counts arising from hispossession of secret Defense Department and National SecurityCouncil budget documents.   Fowler, a 64-year-old former Air Force officer who had worked inthe Pentagon, could be sentenced to 310 years in prison and fined$225,000. Sentencing was set for Jan. 12.   Fowler's lawyers said they would appeal.   The charges against Fowler included conspiracy, mail fraud,illegal conveyance of classified documents and conversion of thepapers for his own use.   The documents, known as ``planning, programming and budgetsystem documents,'' generally dealt with Pentagon procurementplans, sometimes for five years.   Employees for several defense contractors testified that theywere part of a nine-company network whose Washingtonrepresentatives swapped the classified documents in the late 1970sand early 1980s.   The nine companies were identified in testimony as Boeing,Honeywell, Bendix, IBM, RCA (since merged into General ElectricCo.), Grumman, Raytheon, Rockwell and Martin Marietta.   ``This case, in my view, puts everyone in the defensecontracting industry on notice that theft, conversion andconveyance of classified documents will not be tolerated,'' saidHenry Hudson, U.S. attorney for the eastern district of Virginia.``It sends a clear message it won't be tolerated.''   Hudson said investigations continue into the use by defensecontractors of classified Pentagon documents, but he refused todiscuss specifics.   Fowler seemed stunned as he faced the jury while the court clerkread the verdict on each of the 39 counts. At times, he closed hiseyes and other times stood stoically while members of his familycried.   One of the jurors wiped away tears and others fought back tears.   Fowler worked for Boeing from 1978 until he was fired in 1986after an investigation began.   Boeing pleaded guilty to receiving classified documents fromFowler and has agreed to pay fines of $5.2 million.   Fowler had little to say after the verdict, but when askedwhether he had been made a scapegoat, he said: ``I would rather notcomment on that. I mean, you can draw your own conclusions.''   During closing arguments, Assistant U.S. Attorney Randy Bellowsdescribed Fowler as the ``linchpin'' of the document-swappingnetwork.   ``Mr. Fowler was the common thread running through every witnesswho was trafficking in this secret material,'' Bellow said. ``Mr.Fowler played a unique role in the conspiracy: He was thesupplier.''   Defense lawyer John Bray said the only reason Fowler wasprosecuted was because he refused to divulge his sources.   ``Dick Fowler has made a very unfortunate enemy by what he hasdone _ the Pentagon,'' Bray said.</TEXT></DOC>
