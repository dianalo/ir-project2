Among those countries that link their currencies,officially or unofficially, to the U.S. dollar, expectationsof further easing by the Federal Reserve may prompt modestinterest-rate reductions. Hong Kong, which maintains a rigidcurrency link to the U.S. dollar, is more likely thanSingapore, Thailand and Indonesia to follow U.S. rates lower.And Malaysia is likely to ignore any U.S. rate cut altogetherand continue to tighten its monetary policy.   In Hong Kong, further rate cuts will depend directly onthe U.S. as long as the Hong Kong dollar remains fixed atHK$7.80 to the U.S. currency. A wider differential than theusual one percentage point between Hong Kong and U.S. ratesproved unsustainable after the Fed on Aug. 8 trimmed itstarget for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point to5.5%, and banks in the colony cut rates two weeks ago toalleviate resultant pressure on the local currency. (Theykept their key mortgage rate unchanged to prevent a surge ininflation and damp property speculation.)   Sanjoy Chowdhury, senior economist at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.in Singapore, expects Hong Kong's prime lending rate to fallfrom the current 9% during the next three to six months, inline with further Fed easing, then creep back up to 9.5% nextyear as the colony's economy picks up.   But Miron Mushkat, chief regional economist at BaringSecurities (Hong Kong) Ltd., warns of the near-term potentialfor a surprise rise in U.S. rates. &quot;One shouldn't be caughtwith overly optimistic expectations for further cuts,&quot; hesays.   In Singapore, slower economic growth and a cooling of theconstruction sector prompted authorities atgovernment-controlled DBS Bank Ltd. to trim the prime lendingrate on Sept. 13 by 1/4 percentage point to 7.25%, leading tosimilar cuts at other major banks. And some analysts saythere's more to come.   Malaysia, however, is still tightening credit following aprolonged reluctance to do so amid last year's double-digitsurge in economic growth. Interest rates continue to rise asKuala Lumpur struggles to contain inflation, now at a 5.5%annual rate, and ease constraints on the labor supply. Butthe belated commitment to price stability may be too little,too late.   &quot;There's more pain to come,&quot; says Mr. Mushkat. Malaysianauthorities &quot;have been obsessed with growth,&quot; he says. &quot;Therehas been an unwillingness to balance growth with stability,and they have overlooked the dangers of easy money.&quot;   Limiting the potential for higher rates, notes Ian P.MacFarlane, chief economist at Wardley Investment Services(HK) Ltd., is the widening differential between Malaysian andglobal interest rates, which could slow direct investment.   Thailand and Indonesia, meanwhile, are emerging fromperiods of tight credit aimed at curbing inflation andreducing current-account deficits. The Bank of Thailand lastweek cut its discount rate to 11% from 12% amid signs thatinflation is holding steady at an annual 5.6%, a recentimport boom has tapered off and overall economic growth isbelow projections. Banks are expected to follow with a cut intheir prime rate in a month or so.   In Thailand, there also was considerable politicalrationale for the rate cut. &quot;I think business was hurting sobadly, they had to do something,&quot; says Mr. Chowdhury.Uncertainty surrounding the coming ratification of a newconstitution and a general election to be held early nextyear also prompted the move. However, further significantrate cuts would require continued improvement in thecurrent-account deficit and inflation, analysts say.   Since clamping down on credit in mid-1990, Indonesia hashad &quot;the most oppressive monetary climate in all of SoutheastAsia,&quot; says Mr. Mushkat. Loan demand and credit growth hadsoared following the government's substantial liberalizationof financial markets in 1989, prompting the tighter policy tocounter a spike in inflation.   Indonesian authorities cut some deposit rates in July,after the economy took a nose dive, dragging the equitiesmarket along with it, and some analysts say the government isnow poised for a substantial easing. Domestic interest ratescould fall below 20% by year's end from the current level ofabout 24%, predicts Mr. MacFarlane, and they could be at 15%to 16% by the end of 1992. However, others note thatIndonesia's current-account deficit for the first nine monthsof 1991 is expected to equal 8% of gross domestic product forthe period, and inflation, though down from its peak level of14% in the mid-1980s, is still uncomfortably high at 9%.   Japan and Taiwan have had more success with their tightmoney policies. Japanese banks' efforts to meet stiffercapital-adequacy requirements imposed by the Bank forInternational Settlements helped bring growth in Japan'sbroadly defined money supply to historic lows earlier thisyear. This allowed the Bank of Japan in July to respond toslowing economic growth in the second quarter with its firstdiscount-rate cut since February 1987.   Prime lending rates have since fallen steadily each month,culminating in last week's announcement of a further cut inshort-term prime rates to 6.9% from 7.5% for October. Asthose reductions became effective Tuesday, the Bank of Japanannounced that it will lower banks' reserve requirement by40% -- its first such move in five years -- subtly easingcredit further by freeing more cash for banks to lend.Moreover, Mr. MacFarlane expects the Bank of Japan to cut itsdiscount rate twice by year's end.   Acceding to pressure from major domestic exporters andborrowers, Taiwan's major banks last week cut their primelending rates by 0.5 to 0.45 percentage point, to between8.875% and 9%. The move followed the central bank's0.25-percentage-point cut in its rediscount rate, bringingthe rate to its lowest level since April 1989, when the bankbegan a credit clampdown to contain inflation and reverse anarrowing trade surplus. Since July, monetary officials havesought to ignite the economy and elicit a depreciation of theNew Taiwan dollar with three discount-rate reductions and twoadjustments of banks' reserve requirements.   Citing ample liquidity and relative price stability inTaiwan, Mr. Chowdhury expects the prime rate to fall further,to 8.5%.   South Korea's efforts to correct a deteriorating tradebalance with tighter credit have exhibited more style thansubstance, says Mr. MacFarlane, noting that the governmentcontinues to ration credit independent of market rates tosuit its economic growth agenda. Analysts blame Seoul'sreluctance to let market forces dictate interest rates on thenation's volatile political history: In the gradualtransition from authoritarianism to democracy, the governmenthas been afraid to inflict too much pain and has thus tendedto err on the side of easy money. Now, with double-digitinflation and a widening trade deficit, analysts say Seoulshould accelerate its liberalization of interest-rate policy.   Elsewhere in the region, signs of economic recovery inAustralia and New Zealand promise to damp prospects forsignificant interest-rate reductions in the near term, whilecurrently high rates in the Philippines will likely remainuntil after next year's national elections.</TEXT></DOC>
