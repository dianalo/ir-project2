Perry (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> EXE CNG </G><TEXT>   Sen. Robert Dole won a big victory in the Iowa Republican caucuses. But the news that sent shock waves across the nation was that former television evangelist Pat Robertson ran second, easily humiliating Vice President George Bush, who finished third.    With almost all of Iowa's 2,487 precincts reporting, the Kansas Republican was winning 37% of the vote, with Mr. Robertson in second place with 25% and the vice president next with 19%. In fourth place was Rep. Jack Kemp, with a little more than 10%; trailing far behind were former Delaware Gov. Pierre du Pont and former Secretary of State Alexander Haig.    Mr. Robertson's striking performance answered the question everyone in Iowa had been asking for months: Does he have a following?    The answer, of course, is yes, he does. Strangers for the most part to Iowa's political process, Mr. Robertson's mysterious army of evangelical Christians materialized at the polling places.    Richard Pinsky, Mr. Robertson's Iowa field director, said the campaign had mailed 130,000 tape cassettes to Iowa voters in the last 10 days. On those cassettes, Mr. Robertson, an expert in the art of mass communications, quietly outlined his highly moral and patriotic themes.    &quot;We began to see this turning around as those cassettes began arriving in people's homes,&quot; Mr. Pinsky said.    Mr. Pinsky believes conservatives in the party unable to accept mainstream Republicans Dole and Bush will now begin to rally around Mr. Robertson. The first casualty in that kind of shift would be Mr. Kemp, who appeals to many of the same voters.    The next stop is the New Hampshire primary a week from today. Polls in New Hampshire have shown Mr. Bush ahead, trailed by Mr. Dole and Mr. Kemp. The New York congressman has been surging in the past week or two.    Now all the cards in the deck are shuffled. Mr. Bush's lead is immediately in serious jeopardy and Mr. Kemp's surge becomes questionable.    The conventional wisdom has accepted for weeks that Iowa is friendly territory for Mr. Robertson but that New Hampshire is not. So another test awaits the Virginia preacher, whose father was a U.S. senator.    Down the road, though, is Super Tuesday on March 8, when voters in 20 states, 12 of them in or on the edge of the South, get their chance to join the proceedings. Mr. Robertson has a lot more support in many of these churchgoing Southern states than he was ever thought to have had in Iowa.    For Mr. Bush, the Iowa results are nothing short of calamitous. It was here in Iowa eight years ago that Mr. Bush won what may have been his greatest triumph -- his upset of Ronald Reagan in these same caucuses. His supporters have hung together ever since, holding reunions, reading &quot;Bush Brigade&quot; newsletters.    Before the votes were cast, David Keene, a senior Dole adviser, said he didn't think the Bush people could recreate the 1980 magic. He said he thought the Bush organization was older and less enthusiastic than the new organization put together by 30-year-old Tom Synhorst, the Iowa coordinator for the Kansas senator.    Mr. Bush, who had flown out of Iowa yesterday for New Hampshire, admitted he was &quot;disappointed&quot; by the Iowa results, but maintained he still believes he will be the GOP nominee. &quot;I'm a fighter,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm not going to slink away.&quot;    Bill Brock, Mr. Dole's campaign manager, summed up the opinion of many. &quot;It's a devastating blow for George Bush,&quot; he said.    Mr. Bush campaigned hard in Iowa, building on the organization he created in 1980, when he upset Ronald Reagan. His campaign figured it won points when Mr. Bush gave his enthusiastic support to the U.S.-Soviet treaty banning short-range and medium-range nuclear missiles in Europe and when he engaged in verbal battle on TV with CBS newsman Dan Rather. (Mr. Dole was slow in coming around to support the treaty.) But the vice president was hurt by the unpopularity of the Reagan administration in Iowa.    Mr. Dole campaigned hard as a Midwesterner, reared in a small town in a family so poor his grandparents were on welfare. &quot;He's one of us,&quot; his ads proclaimed. Mr. Dole put together a new organization with the help of Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley. Many observers thought it was younger, fresher and more enthusiastic than Mr. Bush's.    The confrontation between these two mainstream Republicans turned increasingly nasty as the time neared for Iowans to vote. Mr. Dole and the vice president don't like each other very much, and the antipathy works its way down through their aides and volunteers.    Mr. Robertson was the mystery candidate in Iowa right from the start. The former television evangelist built his campaign around charismatic and Pentecostal Christians, many of whom had watched his TV show, the &quot;700 Club.&quot; &quot;He's the X factor,&quot; said Rich Bond, Mr. Bush's Iowa political director.    Challenging Mr. Robertson for many of those same voters was Mr. Kemp. In the final hours of the campaign, he released a list of 102 evangelical Iowa pastors who were supporting him.    Mr. du Pont campaigned as an outsider with radical new ideas. Mr. Haig skipped Iowa to concentrate on New Hampshire.    The emphasis on last night's Republican caucuses was on the straw vote, which has no bearing on the party's choice of 37 delegates to the national convention. The delegate-selection process was scheduled to get under way after the straw vote, but those results won't be known for weeks.
