Assistant Secretary of State Chester Crocker, just back from anemergency meeting with Cuban, Angolan and South Africanrepresentatives, said he thought the agreement that went intoeffect April 1 was now back on track.   The pact, which grants independence to Namibia from South Africaand envisions a Cuban pullout from Angola, was threatened by anincursion of 1,200 to 1,800 armed SWAPO guerrillas from their basesin Angola.   ``It's still fragile,'' Crocker said. But he added that he wasstruck by ``the extent to which the Cubans want to salvage thisthing.'' Cuba has undertaken to remove an estimated 50,000 troopsfrom Angola by July 1991.   Crocker said the United States believes South Africa too isdetermined to implement the agreements.   Crocker said ``it was hard to explain the motive'' for thedecision made by Sam Nujoma, the head of the Soviet-backed SWAPOgroup, to violate the agreement, which calls for the guerrillas toremain in Angola until May 15.   ``It was a terrible decision from SWAPO's own point of view,''Crocker told reporters. SWAPO sent 300 of its fighters ``to theirdeath'' in Namibia, he said, ``and I would have thought theleadership has something to answer for.''   More than 260 SWAPO guerrillas have been killed in fighting withSouth African-led security forces since their incursion began April1. Some observers have suggested that local SWAPO commandersthought they could return to Namibia the moment the pact went intoeffect.   Nujoma said initially that many of the fighters were already inNamibia and had not crossed from Angola. But the U.N. peacekeepingforce on the ground has refuted the claim. Although Nujoma hascalled on his fighters to retreat to Angola, it was unclearThursday how many had complied.</TEXT></DOC>
