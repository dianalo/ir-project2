The ministers, known as the Group of Seven, are due to meet at the U.S. Treasury to review their nations' economic performance, exchange rates, and the nagging problem of the huge trade surpluses in Japan and Germany and the large U.S. trade deficit.    U.S. and European officials are hinting that the ministers plan no significant new action on the dollar, and will be content to reaffirm the broad exchange-rate ranges they set in the Louvre pact last February. Since that agreement, the dollar has been relatively stable against the Japanese yen and German mark -- at least partly as a result of massive central bank intervention in currency markets and U.S. interest-rate increases.    But the U.S. is expected to press West Germany, as it has previously, to stimulate its domestic demand in order to curb its trade surplus and help absorb increased exports from the U.S. and the Third World.    &quot;We are simply in a situation where the German economic performance is pretty dismal,&quot; said one U.S. official. &quot;It's time for them to make good on their promises to review their policies if growth was less than expected.&quot;    The ministers will conduct a detailed review of each nation's recent economic performance and prospects under a new system of economic indicators and forecasts prepared by the International Monetary Fund. The system, championed by Treasury Secretary James Baker over the objections of some European governments, is designed to improve economic coordination among the big countries by pinpointing both progress and problems on a variety of fronts.    During the review, the U.S. will be called on to discuss its progress in reducing the federal budget deficit, and Japan will be asked to describe its recent moves to raise domestic demand and cut its trade surplus. Both these countries have some progress to report, but Bonn must defend projections of weak growth, a new surge in exports, and a rise yesterday in a key interest rate.    Speaking at a background news briefing yesterday, a Reagan administration official refused to comment on the German interest-rate increase. He said &quot;Germany has performed extremely well&quot; in keeping modest stimulative promises it made earlier this year. But, he added, &quot;The question is what, if anything, additional should we look for.&quot;    U.S. officials concede that the West German economy perked up a bit in the second quarter, but they expect its growth for the full year to be only 1.5% to 2%, below previous projections.    Nevertheless, U.S. officials don't expect West Germany to agree to take strong new stimulative action. Chancellor Helmut Kohl's political position is deteriorating, and many West Germans are far more fearful of inflation than of slow growth.    What's more, German officials have been openly skeptical of the indicator review process adopted by the Group of Seven. In an article published yesterday in a new magazine, The International Economy, German central bank President Karl Otto Poehl attacked the indicator plan, saying &quot;considered judgement and necessary powers of persuasion cannot be replaced by rigid rules and complex technical instruments.&quot;    Mr. Baker, responding to such criticisms, has conceded that more &quot;discipline&quot; would be desirable in the indicator process, but contends the current approach is a vast improvement over previous coordination efforts.    By contrast with West Germany, Japan will bring a strong record of domestic stimulus to the meeting. Though the Japanese economy has been flat lately, U.S. officials believe it may be strong for the year as a whole, and that domestic demand shows signs of healthy growth while exports are off.    The U.S. likely will seek assurances of similar stimulative action from Tokyo next year. But a new government will be in place soon in Tokyo, so no strong pledges are likely now.    Mr. Baker will have to defend U.S. actions to reduce the budget deficit. He has a strong record to point to for the fiscal year coming to a close next week, with a roughly $60 billion reduction expected. Many economists doubt further reductions can be achieved in fiscal 1988, but Mr. Baker will argue that more progress is possible. Congress has been moving toward the outlines of a deficit-reduction plan.    Administration officials expect to be confronted with IMF figures showing the deficit rising, based on no reductions in current services. They will argue that key decisions that could alter that pattern are yet to be taken in the U.S. budget cycle. </TEXT></DOC>
