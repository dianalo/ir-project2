From Alaska's North Slope to Britain's North Sea, oil production has gone flat -- almost everywhere but in the Persian Gulf nations. Meanwhile, oil demand is rising inexorably, leaving the rich Mideast oil fields to fill most of the growing needs.    In as little as five years, consequently, the world's most politically volatile region will hold a more powerful weapon than ever over the world's economies. And it is a weapon that these nations are well practiced at wielding.    &quot;The more we depend on the Middle East, the more we unleash the forces in the region that can lead to an oil disruption,&quot; says Bijan Mossavar-Rahmani, an international-oil expert at Harvard University's Energy and Environmental Policy Center.    The long-term danger, in fact, worries Mideast experts more than the gunboat diplomacy capturing current headlines. A cutoff of Persian Gulf tanker traffic -- and the accompanying loss of 10% to 15% of present world oil supplies -- could be readily handled. Oil could be diverted to pipelines bypassing the gulf. What excess production capacity still exists elsewhere -- in Mexico, Venezuela and Indonesia, for example -- could be tapped. And oil stockpiles in major consuming nations could help for some weeks.    But after 1990 or so, no pipeline or stockpile could overcome a new assertion of Mideast political strength if current global trends in production and demand continued. &quot;The oil exporters of the Middle East will reassert control over world oil supplies in the near future, and they will use that control to further their political and economic interests,&quot; says G. Henry M. Schuler, the director of energy-security studies for the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.    With crude-oil production, at today's prices, running $1 billion a day at the wellhead, petroleum remains the world's largest industry -- and one of the most delicately balanced.    The exact point at which the Mideast -- the only region with significant excess capacity -- will become the world's swing producer depends on numerous factors, including actions by members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries themselves. For the next few years, in fact, OPEC probably will have difficulty holding down its members' oil output to levels set by the cartel.    Nevertheless, non-OPEC producing nations, which have held the greatest influence over the world's petroleum balance in recent years, are rapidly losing control. Non-OPEC production outside the Soviet Union has declined and now is less than half the 47.6 million barrels a day being consumed in the non-Communist world.    That is a stark turnabout from only two years ago, when experts expected non-OPEC output to keep rising -- and cutting further into OPEC's share of world oil markets. As prices soared in the 1970s, oil companies rushed to develop known fields in Mexico, the North Sea and Alaska's North Slope and to step up the search for new fields. For a decade, oil production outside OPEC exploded, adding as much as one million barrels of daily production capacity each year.    However, much of the frantic drilling, especially in the U.S., was like putting more straws in a soda bottle, oil operators now concede. Non-OPEC oil was sucked up more quickly than new discoveries were found. The extra output contributed to the oil glut that triggered last year's oil-price collapse and to the slump in drilling.    But after 10 years of growth, non-OPEC output has finally declined -- just as oil consumption began rising. The production downturn has hit hardest in the U.S., which has the world's biggest appetite for oil as well as the highest production costs. In Texas alone, more than 20,000 oil wells have been shut in, plunging the state's oil production to the lowest level since 1944. Nationwide, crude-oil output has dropped 9% since February 1986 to fewer than 8.3 million barrels a day -- it is still falling -- and less than half of last year's production was replaced by newly found reserves.    America's sobering dependence on foreign oil was dramatized in the last week of July when, for only the second time in history, its petroleum imports exceeded its crude-oil production.    The oil industry is working hard to stem the decline in output, though only within the limits of economic practicality. Now that oil prices have recovered to some $18 to $20 a barrel, or to about two-thirds the level before the price collapse, exploration is stirring anew. In southern Louisiana, service vessels that haul anchors and drilling mud are in tight supply. Oil companies are yearning, and lobbying heavily, to drill in previously off-limits areas of Alaska and of California coastal waters.    But the great oil fields that formed the backbone of the non-OPEC boom -- in the U.S., Britain, Canada and Australia -- are quickly passing their prime. Production is about to peak in Prudhoe Bay, currently North America's biggest oil field. In the British sector of the North Sea, 27 of the 32 major fields, including the venerable Brent, already have peaked. In the Norwegian sector, Phillips Petroleum Co. this month began the huge job of raising five endangered offshore platforms; as oil has been drained from its aging Ekofisk field, the seabed has sagged 12 feet.    Outside the U.S., new oil-exporting nations are helping slow the growth of OPEC's power. North Yemen, with major oil finds in recent years, could be a rising star among oil exporters. Discoveries are being reported in Angola, Malaysia, Pakistan and Colombia. And some veteran producers outside OPEC -- such as Norway, Egypt and Mexico -- still have spare production capacity that could take up some of the slack.    But these sources of supply could prove of little comfort: Even though Mexico and some Mideastern, African and Asian producing nations don't belong to OPEC, they generally coordinate production with the cartel, whose policies are dominated by the Persian Gulf countries of Saudi Arabia and Iran. The Soviet bloc and China have emerged as important oil exporters, although dependence on them is barely preferable to dependence on OPEC suppliers. And in any case, Communist exports, at 2.4 million barrels a day, have probably reached their limit.    Thus, all told, the world is becoming ever more dependent on OPEC oil. Last year, non-OPEC production fell 200,000 barrels a day to about 22.4 million barrels. Although some optimistic experts believe that non-OPEC production could rise slightly this year, they concede that it won't begin to keep pace with demand.    OPEC -- and particularly the Persian Gulf -- stands ready to fill the gap. While the U.S. strains to meet its oil needs, Saudi Arabia, for instance, is currently producing oil at only half of capacity. Saudi Arabia and other OPEC nations as well have varied production levels in a bid to keep world oil prices near the OPEC benchmark of $18 a barrel. But by almost any measure, OPEC now accounts for nearly one-third of world-wide oil production of 20 billion barrels a year.    Even without any increase in demand, OPEC would account for as much as half of global production by the year 2000, says Raymond H. Hefner Jr., the chairman of the Independent Petroleum Association of America. Worse still, the Oklahoma oil man adds, &quot;that increased production will have to come mainly from Persian Gulf countries.&quot;    But Western oil-consuming nations are likely to feel the repercussions well before the turn of the century. History suggests that the trigger point for oil &quot;crises&quot; -- the 1973-1974 Arab oil embargo, for example -- is reached whenever the call on OPEC's oil exceeds 80% of its producing capacity.    And that trigger point is approaching rapidly. By year end, the U.S. alone will have absorbed nearly two million barrels a day, or 20%, of the excess capacity that OPEC had in January 1986, says Charles J. DiBona, the president of the American Petroleum Institute. &quot;That two million barrels gets us one-third to one-half the distance toward the 80% point,&quot; he says, &quot;and, of course, demand is rising elsewhere in the world.&quot;    The Persian Gulf's emergence as the world's principal oil bank is practically assured by another, longer-term factor: Mideast producers hold 58% of the world's total proven reserves of nearly 700 billion barrels. Thus, energy economists say, oil consumers have little choice but to turn increasingly to the region for future needs. &quot;There will be a shift back to the Middle East that's going to become more evident as we enter the 1990s,&quot; says John H. Lichtblau, the president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation.    And the ramifications will go far beyond international economics. There is a fine line between trade and politics in the Persian Gulf nations. Some studies suggest that the national security of the U.S. could be jeopardized. At the very least, some experts say, the U.S. eventually could face the double burden of maintaining Mideast supply lines while securing reliable supplies of fuel for its own military needs. Moreover, the constant threat to its oil supplies could force the U.S. to adjust its foreign policy --toward Israel, for example -- to suit the Mideast's Islamic nations.    Using oil as a political weapon is hardly unprecedented -- or confined to OPEC nations. &quot;The geopolitics of oil have played major and forceful roles on the world stage for several decades now, and foreign policies are dictated increasingly by oil,&quot; note Robert Goralski and Russell W. Freeburg in their book, &quot;Oil andamp; War.&quot;    The U.S., in fact, was among the first to wield the oil weapon when, in 1956, it cut off shipments to Britain and France to force them to withdraw troops from the Suez Canal area. Since 1970, Libya, Iran and the Arab nations around the Persian Gulf have all reduced oil output for political purposes or have banned shipments to less favored nations at one time or another. Over the years, the chief target has been the U.S., once the world's leading oil producer and now ranked behind both the Soviet Union and Saudi Arabia in production capacity.    Several factors could, of course, alter the otherwise-inevitable shift in the balance of world oil power. Petroleum demand could decline -- though only as a result of a sustained, world-wide recession. A supergiant field, similar to Saudi Arabia's Ghawar, could be found outside the Mideast -- off the coast of China, for example, or in unexplored areas of Alaska or South America; but so far, the search has been disappointing. Perhaps technological breakthroughs could speed commercial development of so-called heavy oil, which lies in prodigious quantities in Venezuela and elsewhere in the Western Hemisphere.    But most experts see dwindling options for major oil-consuming nations. Charles Ebinger, a visiting fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, sees only two: &quot;You either decide on a diplomatic policy paying attention to the significant exporters of this vital commodity of oil, or you need a very vigorous domestic energy policy to develop alternatives.&quot;    ---                   Where the World's Oil Is                   Proven crude oil reserves                    (In billion of barrels)    Middle East         401.9    Western Hemisphere  120.2    Communist areas      79.3    Africa               55.3    Western Europe       21.9    Asia Pacific         19.0    Total World Reserves: 697.4 billion.
