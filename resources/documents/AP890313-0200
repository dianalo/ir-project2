Three lawmakers said they received gifts of $8,000 to $31,000 inJuly and August from Recruit Co., an information servicesconglomerate.   Recruit allegedly provided bargain-priced stocks in a subsidiaryto about 150 politicians and business leaders in exchange for favors.   Japanese newspapers and television stations today quoted ananonymous source with connections to Recruit as saying the companygave a total of $300,000 to 15 members of Parliament, including acurrent Cabinet member, shortly after opposition parties launched aninvestigation last summer into the scandal.   Opposition parties charged the gifts were hush money to lawmakerslinked to Recruit, and they demanded the Takeshita administrationresign to take responsibility for the scandal.   The three Liberal Democratic lawmakers _ Vice Secretary GeneralHajime Ishii, Masao Endo and Kenichiro Otsubo, said they returnedthe money. The names of the other members of Parliament whoreportedly received gifts of money were not immediately known.   ``It is outrageous if such money was received after the Recruitscandal surfaced,'' said Shun Ohide of the Japan Socialist Party,the largest opposition group. ``We will intensify our pressure onPrime Minister Takeshita to either resign or dissolve Parliament andcall an election.''   Government spokesman Keizo Obuchi said in response to the newsreports, ``We conducted a thorough investigation of all currentCabinet ministers last year and understand that no one in thecurrent administration was involved in such a deal since lastsummer. I would like to believe in the result of the probe.''   Prosecutors have arrested 12 people on suspicion of giving ortaking bribes or violating securities laws in the scandal.   No politicians have been arrested, but disclosures of allegedinfluence buying have eroded public support for Takeshita's16-month-old government. Polls indicate public disapproval ratingsfor Takeshita's administration have soared to about 60 percent whilehis approval ratings have plunged to about 20 percent.   The scandal has aggravated the anger of rural voters _ long abastion of support for the Liberal Democratic Party _ who resentconcessions to U.S. demands that Japan open its farm markets.   Although it refuses to allow rice imports, Japan agreed underU.S. pressure last year to end quotas on imports of beef and citrusproducts.   Some analysts predict an upset in July elections for half of theupper house of Parliament, where the Liberal Democrats hold 143 ofthe 251 seats. A severe setback would endanger Takeshita's chancesnext October to win another two-year term as party president andprime minister.   Analysts say, however, that Washington will still be dealing withthe Liberal Democrats next year, regardless of Takeshita's fate.   Successive scandals have failed to shake the Liberal Democrats'grip on power. With the exception of 10 months of Socialistgovernment from 1947 to 1948, the party and its predecessor havegoverned Japan since World War II.   The scandal has caused the greatest political fallout in Japansince former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka was accused in theLockheed affair in 1976.   Tanaka was convicted of taking a $2 million bribe after the U.S.aircraft company admitted it spent $12.1 million to advance itssales in Japan.</TEXT></DOC>
