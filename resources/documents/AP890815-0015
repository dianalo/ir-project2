Poor blacks and Hispanics are under-represented in AIDS clinicaltrials where experimental therapies are tested, and they often don'tseek treatment until they are sick enough to qualify for freemedical care, said AIDS caseworkers attending a governmentconference on AIDS and minorities.   ``They're not as well-educated about prevention and they don'thave a cousin who is a doctor who can tell them about the latestdrug that's being tested in a clinical trial in their area,'' saidDr. Gina Brown, an assistant attending physician in obstetrics andgynecology at Harlem Hospital.   Also, the poor are often suspicious of attempts to get them intomedical research, she said. Many hear only that the treatments, likeAZT, make patients sick and don't understand that the drug cancripple the AIDS virus, said Brown, also a clinical instructor atColumbia Presbyterian Hospital in New York.   One way to include more minorities in clinical trials would be tomove the trials out of the academic medical centers and into theneighborhoods, many conference participants said Monday.   Because much of the research on new drugs is being conducted atuniversities, clinical trials are often set up in a way thatexcludes poor people, said Keith Cylar, a clinical social worker andactivist with the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, known as ACT UP.Often, services like transportation and day care are not considered,he said.   ``Don't put the trials on Madison Avenue or at New YorkUniversity, put them in Harlem,'' he said.   As of a month ago, 7,096 people with AIDS were participating inclinical trials sponsored by the National Institute on Allergy andInfectious Diseases, the chief AIDS research institute at theNational Institutes of Health. Among them were 557 blacks, 731Hispanics and 427 women.   AIDS activists helped start the move to community-based testing,and the federal government is preparing to distribute $6 million inthe fall to groups that want to expand or begin such programs.   P. Clay Stephens, an AIDS services worker from Boston attendingthe conference, dismissed the often-heard reasons researchers givefor excluding women and intravenous drug users, the fastest growingsegment of AIDS cases, from clinical trials: They are unreliablebecause they don't always show up for treatments.   ``Well, are they not coming in because they're at their methadoneclinic? That's a very valid place for them to be,'' she said. ``Didthe woman not come in because her child was sick?   ``Those concepts of non-compliance are often covers for our poordesign based on having dealt with other middle-class people who canplan ahead and are in control of their lives in terms of schedulingand resources,'' she said.   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan, whosedepartment is sponsoring the conference, told the opening sessionthat the government and local communities must do a better jobtargeting AIDS prevention messages to minorities.   He said the messages must be ``culturally relevant andsensitive,'' but he added that ``community standards must berespected'' in educating about the disease that is often transmittedthrough sexual contact.   As of July 31, the total number of Americans diagnosed with AIDSreached 102,621, of whom 59,391 have died since July 1, 1981,according to the Centers for Disease Control.   Blacks, who comprise 12 of the U.S. population, represent 26percent of adult AIDS cases in the United States and 53 percent ofpediatric cases, he said. Hispanics, who make up 7 percent of thenation's population, represent 15 percent of adult cases and 23percent of pediatric cases.</TEXT></DOC>
