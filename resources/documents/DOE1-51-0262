On 7 April 1987, the US Patent and TrademarkOffice announced that it now considers non-naturally occurring non-humanmulti-cellular living organisms, including animals, to be patentablesubject matter. The response to this announcement has been an emotioncontroversy centering on the patent office. The announcement has becomethe lightning rod for all of the practical and moral questions surroundingthe overwhelming potential of genetic engineering. Environmentalistsclaim that genetic engineering will ruin the ecology. The Humane Societyof the US, headquartered in Washington, DC, claims that genetic engineeringwill cause undo suffering to animals produced through genetic experimentsand may ultimately lead to the demise of overly engineered animal species.Religious fundamentalists claim that genetic engineering is wrongfullytinkering with the handiwork of the Almighty. While it may be good thatsuch questions are being raised, the patent office is being wrongly singledout as the source of the problem. This paper discusses the legal problemsthat patents on new lifeforms have caused.</TEXT></DOC>
