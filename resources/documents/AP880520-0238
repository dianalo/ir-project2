The ministers began a 5-day meeting Thursday to prepareresolutions and an agenda for a summit meeting next week of theOrganization of African Unity.   The ministers met in private, but sources, speaking on conditionof anonymity, said the resolution was proposed by Zimbabwe'sforeign minister, Nathan Shamuyurira.   The OAU, celebrating its 25th anniversary, has long tried topersuade the United States, Britain, France and West Germany totake the lead in mandatory sanctions against white-dominated SouthAfrica to try to bring about a peaceful end to apartheid. Its usualtack has been to condemn the Western governments in end-of-summitresolutions.   This year, the OAU seems to be considering new strategies.   Several states are pushing for a U.N. Security Council meetingin southern Africa to dramatize what they say is the Pretoriagovernment's undermining of neighboring black states.   Johnny Makatini, ``foreign secretary'' of the African NationalCongress, the biggest guerrilla group fighting the South Africangovernment, said in an interview that the ANC wants African leadersto mount a new type of diplomatic offensive.   ``For example, we have hardly been making use of the U.S.lobbying system,'' he said. ``We want to establish contact andsolicit support of legislators in Washington for the sactions billbefore the Congress.''   Makatini said the same strategy should be adopted for Britain,France, West Germany and Japan.   ``We're going to go for individuals,'' he said. ``For 25 years,we have been relying on government or parties in power. But when itsuits a government it takes a militant position, when not, itretreats.''</TEXT></DOC>
