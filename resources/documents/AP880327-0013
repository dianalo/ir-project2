(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Democrat Richard Gephardt, who had triedto restart his presidential campaign in Michigan, said Saturday hewould meet with his family Sunday to decide whether he would pullout of the race and run for re-election to Congress.   Gephardt, running in third place in returns from Michigan'scaucuses behind Jesse Jackson and Michael Dukakis on Saturday, hadsaid he needed to do well in Michigan to sustain a candidacy thattook off in Iowa but stumbled in the South on Super Tuesday.   ``We're going to go home tomorrow and meet with our family andwe'll have some word for you the first of next week...,'' Gephardtsaid late Saturday. ``We haven't decided anything. We're going togo home and have a family meeting.''   However, Missouri state Rep. Anthony D. Ribaudo, the MissouriHouse majority leader, said late Saturday that Gephardt will fileMonday for re-election to his congressional seat although he willkeep his presidential candidacy alive in some form.   Ribaudo said he spoke to Gephardt who ``informed me he'd like toproceed with his career in Congress. The congressional seat becomes(his) No. 1 priority.''   Tuesday is the deadline for Gephardt to file as a candidate forre-election to Congress from Missouri. Although aides said he couldfile for re-election and remain a candidate for president, hisshowing in Michigan increased the chances he would drop out of thepresidential contest.   Gephardt joined the other Democratic presidential candidates inspeaking to Wisconsin Democrats at the party's annual statewideJefferson-Jackson dinner in Milwaukee.   He said there was ``no question'' that his long bid for thepresidency was worthwhile _ a quest that he said throughout the dayhad taken him to 49 states in 24 months of campaigning.   Campaign manager Bill Carrick said no decisions about the futureof his campaign would be made before Sunday. The mood amongGephardt's forces was somber, and there appeared to be a feeling ofresignation to events that had not gone Gephardt's way.   Asked whether he would decide Sunday, Gephardt said, ``I reallydon't know....''   Gephardt leaped to the top of the Democratic field when he wonIowa's caucuses Feb. 8. He forged a plurality victory in thatlead-off event through widely acclaimed television ads and a strongpopulist message that prompted critics to charge he had switchedpositions on an array of issues in an effort to appeal todisaffected voters. Gephardt based his campaign on his call fortough trade policies with foreign countries.   He finished second in New Hampshire and won South Dakota, butwon only his home state in the 20-state voting on March 8.   Earlier Saturday, Gephardt crossed paths with three otherpresidential candidates _ Dukakis and Sens. Albert Gore Jr. andPaul Simon _ in Wausau, Wis., as they campaigned toward Wisconsin'sApril 5 primary.   The four _ attending an outdoor rally in less than 20 degreeweather _ ddressed several hundred union workers for MarathonElectric who are engaged in a labor dispute and have taken wagecutbacks.   Gephardt said: ``We're here because we care about wages in thiscountry, not going down but going up.''   Gore and Gephardt crossed paths earlier at a Democratic meetingin Merrill, Wis., where Gephardt streuck an optimistic note: ``I'mgoing to give my inaugural address Jan 20, 1989. I invite you to bethere.''</TEXT></DOC>
