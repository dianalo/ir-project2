SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The family of an entertainment executive foundslain in his Beverly Hills mansion believes mobsters had himexecuted because he refused to do business with them, his sistersaid Friday.   ``We think he made the mistake of buying a business that had beenused before by the Mafia, and we think he was trying to run itstraight,'' Marta Menendez-Cano of West Palm Beach, Fla., said aftera memorial service.   Her brother, Jose E. Menendez, was found shot to death Sundaynight along with his wife, Kitty, 44, in their home, a $4 millionSpanish-style mansion with a tennis court.   Menendez, 45, once headed RCA-Ariola Records as well as the U.S.rental car operations for the Hertz Corp.   He was chief executive officer and chairman of the board of LiveEntertainment Inc., an affiliate of Carolco Pictures Inc. in thevideo and music distribution business, and had been praised forimproving the company's performance.   Two of the three companies operated by Live Entertainment hadbeen linked to organized crime before Live Entertainment boughtthem, although Live Entertainment acting President Roger R. Smithhas vehemently rejected suggestions that the deaths may have a moblink.   Ms. Menendez-Cano, the dead man's sister, and former CaliforniaLt. Gov. Mike Curb, a friend for nearly a decade, described Menendezas absolutely honest, although an extremely aggressive businessman.   ``He was very direct, although he had a great sense of humor,''said Curb, the owner of a small record label who met Menendez whenCurb was negotiating with RCA to distribute a record by the countryact The Judds.   ``Sometimes he had to tell people things they didn't want tohear,'' Curb said. ``But he was a wonderful guy, an absolutelyoutstanding person. I just can't believe something like this couldhappen.''   Curb and Ms. Menendez-Cano spoke outside a memorial at theDirectors Guild of America in Hollywood, where 400 people listenedto the Menendez's sons, Eric, 18, and Lyle, 22, eulogize theirparents.   Ms. Menendez-Cano said she had been unaware that two of herbrother's companies had once been linked to organized crime untilshe read newspaper stories on the killings. She said her brother hadalways tried to keep the video business clean.   ``The first thing he did was to get rid of the porno business,''she said. ``Because of his success, he probably was stepping on manyshoes, which some people didn't like.''   International Video Entertainment, which Live Entertainmentpurchased in 1986, had been owned by Noel C. Bloom. Bloom wasidentified in a California attorney general's report on organizedcrime that year as a major distributor of X-rated movies and aformer associate of the late Michael Zaffarano of the Bonannoorganized-crime family.   Peter Hoffman, Carolco's president and chief executive, saidInternational Video Entertainment itself was never involved inpornography.   The other company with a crime-linked past was BeckZack Corp.,which owns the 81-store Strawberries audio and home-video retailingchain in the Northeast. Live Entertainment completed its acquisitionof BeckZack this June.   Beckzack's principal shareholder, Morris Levy, was convicted inMay 1988 of conspiring to extort payments from a record wholesaler.He remains free pending an appeal of his conviction.   An FBI affidavit filed in federal court in New York in connectionwith an investigation of Levy quoted an unidentified informant assaying that a faction of the Genovese crime family owned an interestin the Strawberries chain. The documents called Levy ``a lucrativesource of cash and property'' for the Genovese family leaders.   Ms. Menendez-Cano said her brother had big plans to expand. ``Hesaid he would be controlling the East Coast video business, throughhis careful planning, in the next couple of years.''   Live Entertainment announced Friday that it was forming acommittee to search for a successor to Menendez.</TEXT></DOC>
