The outline of thestudy was introduced. The meteorology simulation was used in the theoriticalcalculations to estimate the variations of radiation and ambient temperaturein the convection sphere correspond to the variations of radiation activetrace gases in the atmosphere. The meteorology simulation can be dividedinto a thermodynamic model and a hydrodynamic model. As for the magnitudeof greenhouse effect due to radiation active trace gases, in case ofCFC, it accounts for about 10 per cent of total gases in the period of1850 to 1980. And in the period of 1980 to 2030, it will be enlargedto 10 to 30 per cent, accordingly, the uncertainties of the effects willbecome larger. The ambient temperature increase in the period of aboutone hundred years in future will be predicted to be 1.5 to 4.5K due togreenhouse effects of CO{sub 2} and other trace gases.
