 As part of the effort, the state has fundedthe North Carolina Supercomputing Center (NCSC) and the MicroelectronicsCenter of North Carolina (MCNC).andM;MCNC is installing a state-wide communications system connecting 10universities and private industrial partners across 300 miles of high-speeddata and video networks.andM;&quot;We fully expect that a Mac at Glaxo Pharmaceutical, Bell Northern Researchor Duke University could use the TCPConnect, NCSA TELNET or NFS [networks] toaccess our Cray YMP,&quot; said Serge Polevitzky, director of technology of NCSC.andO;&quot;Because of the high bandwidth of the fiber or T3 backbone, the quality andspeed of service that a researcher or industrial participant would see from aMac 30 kilometers away would be indistinguishable from the service right hereon site.&quot;andM;When fully upgraded, the backbone of the super network will connect DukeUniversity, the University of North Carolina and North Carolina StateUniversity to Research Triangle Park with optical fiber at a transmissionrate of 45 Mbits per second.andP;  Microwave transmissions at 25 Mbps connect theUniversity of North Carolina at Asheville and East Carolina University inGreenville, which are located at opposite ends of the state.andP;  In contrast,the nationally funded NSFnet uses T1 links running at 1.5 Mbps.andM;For now, the North Carolina visionaries have to be content to operate withinthe boundaries of current technology.andP;  Two T1 links connect sites within 30kilometers of MCNC through a special switch, doubling the transmission rateto 3 Mbps and providing on added link to give the network extra reliability.andM;&quot;Unfortunately, the equipment just isn't available yet for T3 and T2connections,&quot; said Alan Blatecky, director of university programs at MCNC.andO;&quot;If you can believe the manufacturers, there should be something ready toevaluate by February or March of next year.&quot;andM;At the center of the network is the Cray and other shared resources, such asSilicon Graphics image-processing workstations.andP;  And at the ends of thenetwork are the users: scientists and engineers in industry or researchers atuniversities using their choice of personal workstations.andP;  MCNC makes norestrictions on the equipment that can be used on the network.andM;&quot;We are ecumenical about industry standards like X Windows and TCP,&quot; saidPolevitzky.andP;  &quot;That's the leverage on how our staff of 30 has a change toachieve excellence without becoming overbearing and autocratic.andP;  But ifsomeone asks me, I am a Max addict because it is so easy and seductive.&quot;andM;Blatecky has a Mac in his office and has installed Macs in the networkcontrol center to monitor network traffic.andP;  NCSC is also evaluating Macacceleration boards from various vendors and is looking for the first 68040boards to get the fastest possible performance.andP;  The center is also waitingfor serial line IP (SLIP), which will give scientists the ability to runTCP/IP at Ethernet speeds over dial-up lines and use network utilities likeTELNET and NFS at home.andP;  &quot;We run 24hours a day, seven days a week, and thiswill allow us to have exactly the same environment at home as at work,&quot; saidPolevezky.andM;Not content to plan for just next year's technology, MCNC and NCSC areplanning for FDDI (fiber distribution data interface) networks with 100-Mbpsthroughput.andP;  &quot;We expect the 68040 Macs of the '90s to have an FDDI interfacebuilt in,&quot; said Polevitzky.andP;  FDDI will connect Ethernet LANs and fiber ormicrowave wide-area networks to metropolitan-area networks.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
