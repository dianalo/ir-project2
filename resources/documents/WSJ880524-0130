Birnbaum (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> CNG </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   With a grandfatherly smile, retired Brig. Gen. Joe Foss looks into the camera and pronounces the National Rifle Association the policeman's best friend. &quot;Ask them who helped write the law that limits armor-piercing ammunition,&quot; he urges in a television spot.    &quot;Not the NRA,&quot; answers Dewey Stokes, the president of the Fraternal Order of Police. The NRA actually fought the ban on so-called cop-killer bullets until &quot;they saw it was going to be passed and jumped on board,&quot; Mr. Stokes says angrily. In a newspaper ad, he asks: &quot;Has the NRA gone off the deep end?&quot;    It's a question a lot of people are asking. The NRA, with its ability to mobilize hunters and law-and-order advocates in virtually every congressional district, has for years been one of the most feared special-interest groups on Capitol Hill. But now, suffering from a bad case of hubris, it is losing its aura of invincibility.    &quot;The NRA has gotten too powerful in its own mind,&quot; says Rep. Charles Stenholm of Texas, a conservative Democrat and an NRA backer of long standing, who says statements from its leadership in Washington are often &quot;belligerent and unbending.&quot;    Recently, the NRA told its members a bill to ban handguns that can elude airport security would affect dozens of models, perhaps even all of them. Outraged letters flooded congressional offices. In fact, the proposal would have barred only three kinds of tiny handguns, according to the Treasury Department.    Last year, the NRA ran a newspaper ad featuring a harrowing photo of a frightened woman and asserting that a 20-year-old American woman has a 72% chance of being raped, robbed or assaulted in her lifetime. It changed the ad after a Justice Department official publicly complained that it was inaccurate.    Another NRA ad posed the question &quot;Should you shoot a rapist before he cuts your throat?&quot; and stated that only 3% of rape attempts are completed when the victim is armed. The Justice Department says the claim was based on a sample so small -- only about 50 cases -- that it &quot;may be statistically unreliable.&quot;    &quot;They have been carrying things to the extreme,&quot; says Republican Sen. Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas. &quot;They are losing their credibility and their strength.&quot;    The NRA has lately been on the losing end of some congressional battles, something almost unthinkable a few years ago. Not only has it alienated some longtime allies with its statements, but also by championing causes like the armor-piercing bullets and undetectable handguns, it has made an enemy out of one of its most basic constituencies, the police.    As a result, the rifle association has been forced into face-saving compromises on some measures, and it has backed away from its previous support for repealing a ban on the private purchase of new machine guns. Other defeats may be in the offing: Congress is considering requiring a brief waiting period for all handgun purchases, and there is a growing chance that the measure could pass despite the NRA's bitter opposition.    The association defends its tactics and positions as necessary to protect what it sees as the ever-endangered right to bear arms. Its leaders view almost any proposed restriction as the first step toward confiscation of guns, and they believe it is their duty to head off the encroachment with zeal. &quot;We did not choose these battle fields,&quot; says NRA chief executive Warren Cassidy. &quot;They are forced upon us by the anti-gun element.&quot;    By no means is the association finished as a legislative powerhouse. It worked out compromise language in the undetectable-handgun bill ensuring that no weapon currently made would be banned. (The bill is still pending.) And with about 2.8 million members and the nation's seventh-largest political action committee, it is still followed like gospel by many lawmakers from the South and the West. Many congressmen say privately that they would do almost anything to avoid its wrath. &quot;The NRA is as strong as horseradish,&quot; says Rep. Jim Cooper, a Democrat from Tennessee and an NRA supporter.    But the association is unaccustomed to being on the defensive, and its panicky reactions exacerbate its problems. Typical is a feud with Nebraska's Sen. J. James Exon, a conservative Democrat and gun-control opponent who likes to say he was &quot;born with a shotgun in my hand.&quot; When Sen. Exon supported an early version of the undetectable-handgun ban last December, the NRA forgot his lifelong fidelity and blanketed his state with urgent letters to members. &quot;Your senator cast a vote against our rights,&quot; it read. &quot;You must call him today to make sure he doesn't vote against your rights again.&quot;    Sen. Exon was furious. He wrote a newspaper column defending his vote and attacking the NRA, and in an interview makes clear he is still sore. &quot;They are using strong-arm tactics and inflammatory statements,&quot; he says. &quot;They're as far off-base as they can be.&quot;    Many observers ascribe the association's tactics to internal divisions and management turmoil that have racked it for several years. While the NRA has always vehemently opposed gun registration and similar curbs, a large faction in the membership takes an even harder line. In 1986, for example, dissidents at its annual meeting unsuccessfully fought the decision to change course and back a ban on armor-piercing ammo.    Fearing a coup by such insurgents, the NRA board recently gained the ability to choose the association's chief executive, previously elected by members attending the annual meeting. But insiders say the group remains highly sensitive to pressure from its right wing. &quot;They do consider the attitude of those of us who take a harder line any time they consider where they want to be on an issue,&quot; says Neal Knox, a former NRA officer and now the executive director of the Firearms Coalition, a gun-advocacy group. &quot;They are nervous, there is no question about it.&quot;    Some critics say the association's stance also is strongly influenced by gun manufacturers. According to the group's 1987 annual report, nearly 11% of its $71.1 million in revenue comes from ads in its magazine, a great many of which are placed by gun makers. &quot;It appears to law enforcement that the NRA leadership now is putting the profits of its gun backers ahead of the public interest,&quot; charges Mr. Stokes of the Fraternal Order of Police.    NRA officials vigorously deny that. Wayne LaPierre, the executive director of the NRA's Institute for Legislative Action, says the group sometimes takes stands weapons makers dislike, such as encouraging gun imports. &quot;Our main objective is that firearms owned by law-abiding Americans are protected,&quot; he says.    Mr. LaPierre explains why it was so important that the undetectable-handgun bill not ban any existing weapon. The small weapons that might have been affected, he offers, can be used as &quot;trail guns&quot; to kill wounded animals during a hunt. Besides, he adds, &quot;People use them for self-defense, and they collect them.&quot;    Many others, including police groups, fear that such weapons would rapidly fall into the wrong hands. It is the police, in fact, who have emerged as the association's most dangerous foes. For years, police organizations did only occasional lobbying themselves, generally deferring to the NRA to represent them on law-and-order issues. But the NRA's recent stances have strained relations to the breaking point, as have its attacks on local police chiefs who it says oppose efforts to protect gun ownership.    In late 1985, several law-enforcement groups, including the Fraternal Order of Police and the International Association of Chiefs of Police, banded together as the Law Enforcement Steering Committee. The committee now lobbies strenuously for law-enforcement issues, often against the NRA. Legislators who once dreaded the thought of voting against the NRA have become more willing to do so, as long as they are backed by the police.    &quot;Given the option between supporting the NRA and the police, I've come down on the side of the police,&quot; says Arkansas Democratic Rep. Beryl Anthony. For many lawmakers, he adds, &quot;that may be the wave of the future.&quot;    Rep. Richard Durbin, a Democrat from rural Illinois, braved the NRA's ire in 1986 by voting against easing curbs on interstate sale of handguns. When he went home to face constituents and the local press, he had four local law-enforcement officers by his side. His vote, he says, &quot;never hurt me&quot; with the voters and has made him more likely since then to go against the NRA. &quot;Any hesitancy I had just vanished,&quot; he says. &quot;The police groups are very good.&quot;    One other lobbying force has stung the NRA on Capitol Hill: Sarah Brady, the wife of James Brady, the White House spokesman severely wounded along with President Reagan by a handgun wielded by John Hinckley in 1981. Despite her husband's position in the Reagan administration, which generally maintains good relations with the NRA, Mrs. Brady has assumed a highly visible role for Handgun Control Inc., which favors restrictions. &quot;The leadership of the NRA is out of touch and out of step with the mainstream,&quot; she says. &quot;They don't espouse any common-sense solutions any more.&quot;    Mrs. Brady's political ties and willingness to discuss her family's suffering guarantee her a respectful hearing in Congress. &quot;She's been a very powerful spokesman,&quot; says GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona, an NRA enthusiast. One sign of the association's concern: It has dispatched a letter to its members criticizing Mrs. Brady's activities and labeling her a &quot;misdirected woman.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
