<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-70-0390 </DOCNO><TEXT>In the United States, Emergency Core Cooling Systems (ECCS) are requiredfor light water reactors (LWRs) to provide cooling of the reactor corein the event of a break or leak in the reactor piping or an inadvertentopening of a valve. These accidents are called loss-of-coolant accidents(LOCA), and they range from small leaks up to a postulated full breakof the largest pipe in the reactor cooling system. Federal governmentregulations provide that LOCA analysis be performed to show that theECCS will maintain fuel rod cladding temperatures, cladding oxidation,and hydrogen production within certain limits. The NRC and others havecompleted a large body of research which investigated fuel rod behaviorand LOCA/ECCS performance. It is now possible to make a realistic estimateof the ECCS performance during a LOCA and to quantify the uncertaintyof this calculation. The purpose of this report is to summarize thisresearch and to serve as a general reference for the extensive researcheffort that has been performed. The report: (1) summarizes the understandingof LOCA phenomena in 1974; (2) reviews experimental and analytical programsdeveloped to address the phenomena; (3) describes the best-estimate computercodes developed by the NRC; (4) discusses the salient technical aspectsof the physical phenomena and our current understanding of them; (5)discusses probabilistic risk assessment results and perspectives, and(6) evaluates the impact of research results on the ECCS regulations.736 refs., 412 figs., 66 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
