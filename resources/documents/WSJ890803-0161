Butros Ghali, Egypt's minister of state for foreign affairs, spoke at the start of the fifth Symposium on Africa and Latin America, which meets annually, alternating between Cairo and Mexico City.    Mr. Ghali said Africa's share of that total was about $230 billion and Latin America's $440 billion dollars. &quot;These figures clearly demonstrate the magnitude of the problem facing our countries,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
