Rejected in the 1970s as an astronaut, he trained as a space scientist and in 1983 became the first U.S. non-career astronaut to fly on the space shuttle. After that, he kept his hand in the space program by consulting with companies conducting experiments on the shuttle. Now he has found yet another unusual avenue into outer space -- through the Soviet Union.    Last week, Mr. Lichtenberg's Wellesley, Mass.-based consulting firm, Payload Systems Inc., became the first U.S. company to win Commerce Department approval to send a payload into space on a Soviet vehicle. The company has arranged with Soviet authorities to place drug-research apparatus on the Mir space station next year, which will allow experiments of longer duration than available on the shuttle.    Payload's Soviet venture, though of limited technological and commercial significance, has attracted national attention as a symbol of changes in the air between the superpowers. It also represents a major coup for Mr. Lichtenberg's fledgling company as it tries to establish a niche in the business of commercializing space.    The 10-employee concern, headquartered over an office-supplies store in downtown Wellesley, was founded in 1984 by Mr. Lichtenberg and Anthony Arrott, space scientists who met while earning doctorates in biomedical engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Mr. Lichtenberg, 40 years old, and Mr. Arrott, 33, worked on space shuttle research programs while at MIT and planned to use their experience to help other companies and researchers develop shuttle experiments. But they faced big problems after the Challenger exploded in January 1986.    &quot;Several contracts we had on hand went into the deep freeze&quot; after the explosion, said Mr. Arrott, Payload's research director. While waiting for the shuttle program to resume, he added, Payload's planned Soviet venture gives it &quot;a major potential for growth.&quot; The company, however, declined to name its clients in the Soviet venture, discuss other details of the project or say whether any other projects with the Soviets are in the works.    Payload's coup stems largely from connections and skills Mr. Lichtenberg developed at MIT. A former Air Force fighter pilot decorated for service in Vietnam, he was nominated by MIT to fly on the shuttle as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's first U.S. payload specialist, a non-astronaut scientist. NASA selected Mr. Lichtenberg from among some 25 nominees from other research teams. Mr. Lichtenberg said his selection fulfilled a dream &quot;that began when I was a kid and read a lot of science fiction.&quot;    &quot;Byron clearly was the sort of person who had the right stuff&quot; for the shuttle mission, said Charles Oman, an MIT space-science researcher.    Added Richard Chappell, a NASA official who knows Mr. Lichtenberg: &quot;Byron showed proficiency in a broader range of disciplines&quot; than other nominees. &quot;He also is a very good experimentalist. As I heard one NASA scientist say, 'We like people with golden hands.'&quot;    Mr. Lichtenberg developed international space-science contacts while working on the NASA project, said Laurence Young, an MIT space-sciences professor and Mr. Lichtenberg's former mentor. He later expanded his foreign connections through the Association of Space Explorers, a group of U.S. astronauts, Soviet cosmonauts and other space fliers.    Mr. Lichtenberg, who doesn't speak Russian, said those connections probably didn't make a &quot;major difference&quot; in Payload's Soviet pact, but &quot;it didn't hurt. I knew some cosmonauts, and it gave me a little credibility.&quot;    The Soviet Union will gain prestige and scientific contacts from Payload's venture. But space-science specialists said federal approval of the project isn't likely to lower barriers to U.S.-Soviet joint ventures in space involving more sophisticated U.S. technology. &quot;It's encouraging that (federal officials) are allowing a U.S. company to do business with the Soviets,&quot; said a spokesman for Space Commerce Corp., a Houston-based concern that has unsuccessfully tried to win federal approval for launching a U.S. communications satellite on a Soviet rocket. &quot;Beyond that, I don't see much room for optimism.&quot;    The expected resumption of shuttle flights later this year will probably lessen U.S. commercial interest in Payload's Soviet connection. But that won't bother the company, which continues to work with U.S. clients planning shuttle experiments. Moreover, Mr. Lichtenberg has a personal stake in the shuttle's revival: He is to be a payload specialist on a 1990 flight. </TEXT></DOC>
