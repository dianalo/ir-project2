(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Serial killer Ted Bundy exchanged severalletters with a religious broadcaster and anti-pornography crusaderbefore they met for a videotaped interview hours before Bundy'sexecution, an associate said.   James C. Dobson, whose half-hour ``Focus on the Family'' programis heard daily on 1,200 radio stations, was the only member of thenews media to interview Bundy in the days leading up to the Tuesdaymorning execution. Bundy canceled a press conference with 30journalists on Monday.   During the interview, Bundy coolly traced his origins as a serialkiller, describing how boyhood glimpses of violent pornographybecame ``an addiction'' that grew until his ``destructive energy''exploded from fantasy into reality.   ``There are loose in the towns and their communities people likeme today whose dangerous impulses are being fueled day in, day out,by violence in the media ... particularly sexual violence,'' Bundysaid.   Dobson was an outspoken member of former Attorney General EdwinMeese III's federal Commission on Pornography and was a leader ofthe nationwide protest last summer against Universal Pictures' ``TheLast Temptation of Christ.''   Dobson first received a letter from Bundy in 1987, said PaulHetrick, a vice president of the California-based Focus on theFamily ministry. The broadcaster then answered three or four moreletters from Bundy, said Hetrick.   Bundy requested the interview with Dobson through John Tanner, anewly elected state prosecutor in Daytona Beach who previouslycounseled Bundy through a religious ministry at the Florida StatePrison near Starke.   Hetrick would not reveal the content of the letters exchangedbetween Bundy and Dobson, who met for a two-hour private interviewSunday. Dobson is scheduled to address the National ReligiousBroadcasters annual convention in Washington on Saturday.</TEXT></DOC>
