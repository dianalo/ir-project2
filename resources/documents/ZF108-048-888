Inc., Cleveland, has consolidated its system management andnetwork management groups.andP;  The change stemmed from a merger rather than froma grand plan to streamline its organization, according to Ray Beavan, managerof network services.andM;Two years ago, the merger left LTV with five separate management centerswhich were responsible for 6,000 terminals on the company's IBM SystemNetwork Architecture (SNA) network.andM;LTV evaluated its organization and found that money could be saved if theautonomous system management centers and network management centers werecombined.andM;Gradually, the process was completed earlier this year.andP;  Beavan says,&quot;Training is the key to successful merging of system and network groups.&quot;andO;LTV spent more than one month training each operator.andM;Because of the dual management capability, the second release of NetView alsosold well.andM;In September 1988, IBM unveiled NetView's third release.andP;  New featuresincludes: support for the Rexx programming language, which allows customersto automate repetitive network management tasks; and an asset managementfeature, which helped managers track equipment, such as IBM clustercontrollers and microcomputers.andM;ATandamp;T'S UNMA BASED ON OSIandM;ATandamp;T became the second player in the network management race after unveilingits scheme in September 1987.andP;  The plan, Unified Network ManagementArchitecture (UNMA), was based on the emerging International StandardsOrganization's Open System Interconnect (OSI) network model.andP;  The companyalso announced software to control ATandamp;T network products, such as itsSystem/85 PBX and T1 lines.andM;In July 1988, ATandamp;T signed a joint development pact with Cincom Systems Inc.andO;of Concinnati.andP;  Analysts viewed the ATandamp;T/Cincom team as a worthy opponent toIBM.andM;Cincom sells NetMaster, the only NetView replacement product.andP;  Analystsreport that IBM's rapid NetView enhancements during the past few years camein response to NetMaster's success.andM;NetMaster offered many features, such as a programming language and thecapability to manage mainframe operating systems, years before NetViewsupported them.andP;  Mobil Corp., Prudential Insurance Co., and Covia, whichsupplies computer and communications services to United Airlines Inc. andother airlines, are firmly entrenched in NetMaster.andM;In January 1989, ATandamp;T announced its first product to integrate other vendors'network management information.andP;  The key component, the Integrator, runs onATandamp;T 3B computers and provides an operator with a global, graphics interfaceto a network.andM;The Integrator also collects and stores network management information in acentral database management system.andP;  Before a vendor can transmit networkmanagement information to the DBMS, the supplier has to build an interfacethat conforms to ATandamp;T's Network Management Protocol (NMP).andP;  NMP, which isfunctionally equivalent to NetView/PC, translates other vendors' informationinto ATandamp;T formats.andP;  In January, 17 vendors pledged to build NMP interfaces.andM;Also in January, ATandamp;T and Cincom unveiled their first jointly developedproduct, a link between ATandamp;T and SNA network management systems.andM;The link requires two pieces of software.andP;  IBM customers install one module,called the UNMA Application, on an IBM mainframe.andP;  The second, dubbed the SNAManagement Application, runs on an ATandamp;T 3B2 mincomputer.andP;  The softwareenables a user to send information between the two systems.andM;DEC'S EMA MOST RECENT ENTRYandM;The third competitor, DEC, has been the slowest in flushing out its plans.andO;In September 1988, the company unveiled its strategy, Enterprise ManagementArchitecture (EMA).andP;  The architecture's goal was to integrate other vendors'equipment by using he OSI protocol stack, a strategy similar to ATandamp;T's UNMA.andO;Seven vendors signed up to support EMA.andM;DEC planned to publish EMA specifications in the spring.andP;  (Vendors need thespecifications to write software to send their network management informationto a central DEC network management system.)andP;  The spring deadline was pushedback until the end of the year.andP;  (None of the specifications were completedwhen this article was written.)andM;The race to provide a central network management system began three yearsago.andP;  Yet, none of the three major players appears close to the finish line.andO;In fact, analysts and users disagree about who will win the race, and when itwill end.andM;&quot;FAILED TO DELIVER&quot;andM;In 1986, IBM clearly held the lead.andP;  Despite the company's aggressive action,disappointment has replaced initial customer excitement.andP;  &quot;NetView has failedto deliver the integrated voice and data management capabilities that IBMpromised a few years ago,&quot; said James Sever, the manager of nework quality atWestinghouse Electric Corp. in Pittsburgh.andM;Another indication that NetView may be losing its initial luster wasillustrated by a survey of 158 IBM customers by International Data Corp., aFramingham, Mass., market research firm.andP;  The percentage of users deemingNetView as a strategic product fell from more than 50% in 1986 to 25% in1988.andM;Customer discontent stems from many sources.andP;  IBM billed NetView as an easyto use package with a consistent set of capabilities.andP;  As users worked withthe product, they discovered that the five autonomous products were not trulyintegrated.andM;&quot;IBM placed a command set over a group of incompatible products,&quot; said AlbertF. Conklin, a senior system support analyst at Baltimore Gas andamp; Electric,Baltimore.andP;  &quot;Each product still functions autonomously and there is littleconsistency from one package to a second.&quot;andM;NetView is also reportedly difficult to operate.andP;  Wayne Swafford, a systemsprogrammer at E Systems Inc., Greenville, Texas, said, &quot;I have beenprogramming for more than 20 years, yet I have problems with NetView.andP;  IBMpromised to improve the ease of use functions.andP;  The product has many onlineHelp facilities but I often have difficulty interpreting what each mesagemeans.&quot;andM;Despite the problems, NetView sales have been impressive.andP;  Helen Morse,manager of network management product marketing at IBM Communication Systemsin Research Triangle Park, N.C., said that 98% of the company's largest 200customers have acquired the product.andM;Analysts estimate that users purchased approximately 6,000 NetView licenses,and most come from U.S.andP;  companies.andP;  IBM declined to provide any salesfigures.andM;In comparison, Cincom has sold 1,300 NetMaster licenses.andP;  Victoria Duckworth,a senior NetMaster product manager at Cincom, said that U.S.andP;  companiesaccount for only 300 of the licenses.andM;WORKSTATION PREFERRED OVER PCandM;NetView/PC has been criticized.andP;  Vendors supporting the first release of theproduct reported that customer interest was marginal and sales of the productwere minimal.andP;  &quot;NetView/PC was a band-aid placed on a bleeding artery,&quot; saidMichael Fitzpatrick, a senior VP and general manager at Data Switch Corp. inShelton, Conn.andM;The initial problems stemmed from IBM's decision to use its Personal Computeras the foundation of NetView/PC.andP;  &quot;If IBM opted for a powerful workstationrather than the IBM Personal Computer, many of problems would have beenavoided,&quot; said Atul Kapoor, a vice president at Kaptronix Inc., a Haworth,N.J., consulting firm.andM;The microcomputer simply did not have sufficient horsepower to support theapplication.andP;  NetView/PC required a multitasking operating system with plentyof memory and the IBM Personal Computer had neither capability.andM;The blame for NetView/PC's lackluster showing did not fall totally on IBM'sshoulders.andP;  Approximately 50 vendors voiced support for NetView/PC.andP;  Eventhough the product has been available for two years, approximately 20suppliers never kept their promises.andM;Case/Datatel in Cherry Hill, N.J., was one of seven vendors included in theSeptember 1986 NewView/PC announcement, but the company has yet to deliverits first copy of NetView/PC.andM;&quot;We are working on many other enhancements to our product line,&quot; said ScottLedgerwood, the director of product planning at the company.andP;  &quot;There hasn'tbeen a great deal of customer interest in NetView/PC so it has been a lowpriority item.&quot;andM;Users reported that many vendors delivered rudimentary implementations ofNetView/PC.andP;  Last year, Southwestern Bell Corp., which has installed twodozen copies of NetView, purchased one copy of NetView/PC.andM;Doug Weber, the district manager of data network technology at the St. Louiscompany, reported that the software supported few NetView functions.andO;&quot;Obviously, the vendor did not understand NetView or NetView/PC,&quot; he stated.andO;&quot;Simple functions that would make our job easier were missing.&quot;andM;In May 1989, IBM shipped a version of NetView/PC that ran on IBM's OS/2operating system.andP;  This release, which worked with a multitasking operatingsystem and supported 16Mb of random access memory, addressed many initialNetView/PC limitations.andM;The new version sparked some customer interest.andP;  According to WilliamVictoria, the director of network management systems marketing at GeneralData-Comm, Inc. in Middlebury, Conn., &quot;We have received more inquiries aboutthis release than with the previous version of the product.&quot;andM;But vendor support has clearly slipped.andP;  Thirty-two vendors voiced supportfor the OS/2 version of NetView/Pc compared to 50 for the first version ofNetView/PC.andM;IBM's loss is proving to be ATandamp;T's gain.andP;  &quot;Right now, ATandamp;T appears to be astep ahead of IBM in providing an integrated network management system,&quot; saidConklin at Baltimore Gas andamp; Electric.andM;The reason is superior technology.andP;  James Herman, a principal with NortheastConsulting Resources Inc., Boston, noted, &quot;ATandamp;T is building its networkmanagement system with current technology.andP;  The product includes a relationalDBMS, a nice graphics interface, and Unix.andP;  IBM is building on outdated,15-year-old technology.&quot;andM;But, ATandamp;T also has much to prove.andP;  The company's products have gained acclaimbut key components of the line, such as the Integrator, only began shippingthis month.andM;No one is sure how they will function.andP;  &quot;When Net View was introduced,initial reviews were positive,&quot; said General DataComm's Victoria.andP;  &quot;Aftercustomers installed the product, limitations became evident.andP;  The samescenario may be played out with ATandamp;T's products.&quot;andM;Frank Dzubeck, president of Communications Network Architects, a Washington,D.C., consulting firm, pointed to a key shortcoming with ATandamp;T's networkmanagement architecture.andP;  &quot;ATandamp;T's network management approach is geared tophysical connections, links between different pieces of equipment,&quot; heexplained.andP;  &quot;The company's products cannot efficiently manage logical networkitems, such as terminal response time and application software performance.&quot;andM;Even though NetView/PC has not been a blockbuster product, it has been theonly network management tool shipped during the past two years.andP;  Analystsestimate that 1,000 copies of the software have been sold since itsintroduction, compared to near zero implementations of ATandamp;T's NMP.andM;DEC has been criticized for its tardiness in outlining plans and deliveringproducts.andP;  Because the company is at least two years behind IBM and ATandamp;T insome areas, many analysts view DEC as a laggard in the integrated networkmanagement race.andM;Yet, DEC customers do not seem concerned about the giant's slow progress.andO;Ron Meyer, vice president overseeing a global network at Banker's Trust inNew York, said, &quot;DEC is working to make sure its network managementspecifications are correct the first time they are issued.andP;  Other vendorshave rushed out with incomplete solutions.andP;  I would rather wait for a goodtool that works well than purchase a mediocre one now.&quot;andM;Price Waterhouse's Niden agreed.andP;  &quot;DEC's plan to integrate other vendors'network management information is as good as any other vendor's plan.andO;Competitors have talked more about their offerings than DEC has, but theyrealy aren't offering the customer more capabilities.&quot;andM;DEC's strategy will not become clearer until late 1990 when the companydelivers the next release of its network software, according to Niden.andM;NOT WILLING TO WAITandM;Not all customers are willing to wait that long.andP;  &quot;Integrated networkmanagement is at the top of our priority list,&quot; said Robert Parker, the vicepresident of corporate telecommunications management at first National Bankof Chicago.andM;Last summer, the bank issued a request for proposals for an integratednetwork management system.andP;  It plans to install its system during the firstquarter of 1990.andM;Large corporations, like First National Bank, may be exceptions.andP;  Manyorganizations, such as the New York state government, are simply not ready toinstall integrated network management systems.andM;William Wray, a manager for the criminal justice information systemsimprovement project in the division of criminal justice services for thestate of New York, said the state has started to build an integrated backbonenetwork.andP;  That task will take at least two years.andM;&quot;Once the network is built, we will need an integrated network managementsystem and we are confident that one will be available.&quot;andP;  Wray said.andM;Until then, a network management technician will continue bouncing fromscreen to screen trying to determine why Amy Jones' terminal does notfunction.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
