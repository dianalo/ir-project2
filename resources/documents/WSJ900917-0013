Bulkeley   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>09/17/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE C2</SO><CO>   DEC</CO><IN>STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)HEARD ON THE STREET (HRD)COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (CPR)</IN><LP>   BOSTON -- Digital Equipment stock plummeted 2 7/8 Fridayto 56 3/8, its lowest point since 1985, but few analysts arewilling to bet it has hit bottom.   On the surface, there is much to recommend the world'ssecond biggest computer maker at these levels. After all,many analysts were boosting the stock in May when it hit a12-month high of 95. Digital is likely to survive anyindustry shakeout. It has about $17 a share in cash, asterling balance sheet and a current price far below the$66-a-share book value long seen as a floor for the stock.</LP><TEXT>   But with a deteriorating economy hurting sales world-wideand a huge work force being pared only slowly, Digital'soutlook remains somber. Analysts slashed earnings estimateslast week. For the fiscal first quarter, ending Sept. 30,many expect Digital to incur its second consecutive quarterlyloss.   Moreover, there is growing doubt that Digital willinitiate cash dividends at its November annual meeting.Digital's president and founder, Kenneth H. Olsen, indicatedlast year that he had dropped his 33-year opposition topaying dividends. A dividend would allow purchase of theshares by institutions that are prohibited from buying stockswithout dividends. But now the chances of a dividend are&quot;very slim,&quot; says Jay P. Stevens of Dean Witter Reynolds, whowas bullish on the stock most of the year.   Analyst John Adams of Adams Harkness andamp; Hill notes thatDigital is pushing employees to leave under a voluntaryseverance plan; he thinks a dividend is unlikely whenemployees are being asked for sacrifices. Citing Digital'sreluctance to breach its no-layoff tradition, he says, &quot;youhave to empathize with Ken Olsen. He is virtually the onlyindustrial saint around.&quot;   Analysts expect Digital to start a new stock buy-backprogram soon to bolster the shares. In April it began afive-million-share buy-back for 4.1% of its stock.Institutional traders said Digital finished that buy-backlast week, perhaps contributing to the stock's decline.   Patricia Laupheimer at Shearson Lehman Brothers cut herprofit estimate last Monday after a Digital spokesman&quot;described 75% to 80% of their markets as sluggish.&quot; Shenotes that some big, slow-growth computer stocks currentlytrade at multiples of 10 or less times earnings while Digitalremains above that level, compared with Street estimates.   For fiscal 1991, ending June 30, many analysts have cuttheir estimates to $4 to $5 a share from a mean $6.22estimate a few weeks ago. Last year's share earnings wereonly 59 cents after a big restructuring charge, down from$8.45 the year before. &quot;The problem is you don't know whatearnings are going to be,&quot; says Steven Milunovich of FirstBoston. &quot;In the near term, there's not a lot of reason to beoptimistic.&quot;   Many investors remain disenchanted by Digital'scost-cutting efforts. Last spring the Maynard, Mass., companybegan its first voluntary severance program with employmentat a record 125,800 persons. By next June, officials havesaid, employment will be down to about 119,000.   Nevertheless, analysts say Digital remains overstaffedcompared with competitors. Stephen Smith, a PaineWebberanalyst who recommends the stock long term, calculates thatif Digital's overhead and research and development levelswere similar to International Business Machines Corp., theworld's largest computer maker, and Hewlett-Packard Co.,&quot;that would add $8 a share to earnings. They hired too manypeople in the boom days.&quot;   John Levinson of Goldman Sachs, who has been bearish onDigital and other makers of midrange computers for years,says that its $103,000 revenue per employee, a measure ofproductivity, is less than half that of Sun Microsystems, theleader in the workstation market that Digital is trying tocrack. &quot;I believe DEC has many more restructuring costsahead,&quot; he says.   Skittish as most analysts are about Digital, they soundlike wild-eyed optimists compared with Marc Schulman of UBSSecurities. A longtime Digital watcher, he was recommendingthe stock two months ago because he predicted acceleratingearnings momentum. Now he thinks the company will have a netloss of $1 a share in the current quarter and only break evenfor the full year because of weak revenue.   Mr. Schulman thinks Digital may have a 1% revenue declinefrom last year's $12.94 billion, even though the new VAX 9000mainframe computer may add $1 billion in sales. Last year'spaltry 1.6% revenue gain came when the U.S. economy was&quot;muddling along&quot; and Europe was strong, he says. Today, &quot;theU.S. economy is worse than before. The European economy isworse than before and the degree to which users are willingto buy minicomputers is worse than before.&quot;   ---   Digital Equipment   (NYSE; Symbol: DEC)                                                                                                          Business: Computers                                                                                                          Year ended June 30, 1990:   Revenue: $12.94 billion   Net income: $74.4 million*; 59 cents a share                                                                                                          Fourth quarter, June 30, 1990:**   (Net loss): $2.11 a share vs. net income: $2.51 a share                                                                                                          Average daily trading volume:   564,677 shares                                                                                                          Common shares outstanding: 122 million                                                                                                          *Includes $550 million pretax restructuring charge.   **Latest quarter net loss of $256.7 million includes $400million pretax restructuring charge.</TEXT></DOC>
