Relation of spontaneousradiation mechanisms of individual electron and stimulated radiationeffects in electron beams has been elucidated, grounds of linear electrodynamicsof radiative beam instabilities are stated, and main mechanisms of theirnonlinear stabilization are elucidated as well. Various simulated processesin electron beams are considered from the unique point of view usinga simple mathematical apparatus and such physical laws as conservationand Newton laws.</TEXT></DOC>
