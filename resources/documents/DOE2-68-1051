The differences, which are simulated well by a primitiveequation model, are attributed to the effects of terrain blocking, whichis difficult to incorporate into objective interpolation schemes. Implicationsfor plume trajectory predictions are also discussed. Our area of interestlies in a semi-arid region in southeastern Washington; for the numericalsimulations we concentrated on a domain 100 by 100 km in size. The central,eastern, and northeastern portions of the region are relatively flatwith only a gentle rise toward the northeast corner of the domain. Thenorthwestern and southern regions have considerably more terrain relief,with ridge lines extending up to 1000 m above the lowest points in thecentral basin. The Columbia River enters near the northwest corner ofthe domain and is joined by the Yakima River near the southeast corner.A contour map of the central part of the region is included. In the summerof 1982, limited tracer measurements were made with an aircraft to studysome of the circulation patterns that develop in this area. On severaldays, starting about an hour after sunrise, SF{sub 6} was released forapproximately 90 min at an elevation of 10 m AGL near the center of thebasin.</TEXT></DOC>
