(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Corn syrup maker Staley ContinentalInc. rejected as inadequate a $1.33 billion takeover bid from aBritish company Thursday but indicated it might entertain a betteroffer.   Tate andamp; Lyle PLC, which made the $32-a-share cash tender offerApril 8, declined comment on Staley's decision but one analyst saidhe expected the British sugar refiner to increase its bid.   Tate andamp; Lyle did announce it has arranged a $1.3 billion loanagreement wiht a group of 14 banks to finance a takeover.   Staley stock rose 75 cents to $37.50 a share in New York StockExchange composite trading.   Staley, the nation's second-largest refiner of corn sweeteners,said it would consider various alternatives for enhancingshareholder value. The options include a financial restructuring orrecapitalization, issuing stock to a third party, selling all orpart of the company, a joint venture or a leveraged buyout, StaleyChairman Donald E. Nordlund said in a letter to stockholders.   Spokesman David Satterfield said Staley had held discussionswith at least one other party but added that the company wanted toremain independent.   ``I think the board has asked management to look at all thevarious alternatives because as part of its fiduciaryresponsibility they've got to be able to make the best judgmentpossible for shareholders,'' Satterfield said.   One option likely to present itself is a higher offer from Tateandamp; Lyle, said John M. McMillan, an analyst with Prudential-BacheSecurities Inc. in New York.   ``I think they officially put the `for sale' sign on thecompany,'' McMillan said. ``But from a shareholder's point of view,they said all the right things: That they're contemplatingalternative moves designed to enhance the value of Staley's stockbeyond the $32 that Tate and Lyle offered.''   McMillan said Staley probably was worth about $40 a share. Buthe said he doubted a bidding war would develop.   ``I don't think there's a line of bidders that want to get intothe U.S. sweetener industry,'' he said. ``It's a competitive marketand it takes special managerial skills.''   Tate andamp; Lyle is Britain's second-largest sugar refiner. Anacquisition of Staley would give it a foothold in the U.S. cornsweetener market and make it the only supplier of all three typesof sugar _ corn, beet and cane _ in the United States.   Tate andamp; Lyle's owns nearly 5 percent of Staley's 30.4 millionoutstanding shares of common stock and is offering to buy alloutstanding shares of all classes of stock in a deal it valued at$1.33 billion.   Tate andamp; Lyle's chairman, Neil M. Shaw, has said he would move thecompany's headquarters from suburban Chicago back to Decatur, thesite of Staley's largest corn-processing plant and the company'shome until three years ago.   Staley Continental is a holding company formed in early 1985 forthe A.E. Staley Manufacturing Co. and CFS Continental Inc., afood-service supplier.</TEXT></DOC>
