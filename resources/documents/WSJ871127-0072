In March, Sonatrach filed an arbitration claim against Distrigas for $260 million. The claim charged Distrigas with failure to accept gas deliveries agreed upon in a contract made in 1976.    Under terms of the agreement, Distrigas will pay a &quot;substantial&quot; but as yet undetermined sum to Sonatrach. Cabot said its previously established reserves against Sonatrach's claims &quot;should be adequate&quot; to cover the costs of resolving the dispute.    Terms of the new agreement call for Sonatrach to deliver as many as 10 shipments of gas to Distrigas before March 31, 1988, and 17 shipments of gas a year for 15 years after that. Distrigas hasn't received gas from Sonatrach since September 1985, when Distrigas filed for protection from creditor lawsuits under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code. Distrigas emerged from bankruptcy-law proceedings last July.    The agreement is subject to the approval of the boards of directors of Cabot and Distrigas as well as authorities in Algeria. Cabot said it plans to have a definitive agreement by the end of the year. </TEXT></DOC>
