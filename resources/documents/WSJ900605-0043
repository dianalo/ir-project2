Illinois and Iowa were expected to remain mostly drythrough tomorrow, with a chance of rain again Thursday andFriday. Temperatures are expected to rise late this week,which also would help the emerging crop.</LP><TEXT>   A continuation of wet, cool weather would have meant areduction in the likely size of the soybean harvest. Wetweather in May caused some analysts to trim their forecastsfor the corn crop.   Soybeans for July delivery fell 9.25 cents a bushelyesterday to settle at $5.9275. The July corn contract felltwo cents a bushel to $2.7375, but wheat for July deliveryrose 1.75 cents a bushel to $3.31.   The soybean contract was down about 12 cents and the corncontract off about four cents early in the session, butprices recovered slightly before the close at the ChicagoBoard of Trade.   Analysts said the decline in corn prices followed newsthat the weather had improved just in time for many farmersto meet the corn-planting deadline. It's a rule of thumb thatfor maximum yields, most Midwest corn fields must be plantedby June 1.   Soybeans can be planted later than corn, so farmers whomiss corn-planting deadlines tend to shift to soybeans.   Planting in the Midwest soared last week because of thedry weather. Iowa officials said that 65% of soybean acreswere planted as of Sunday, compared with 26% a week ago. Lastyear at that time, however, 98% of planting was completed. InIllinois, soybean fields were 46% planted, compared with 17%a week ago and 81% last year.   Corn planting was 94% complete in Iowa, compared with 87%last week and 100% last year. Corn planting in Illinois was79% complete as of Sunday, compared with 71% a week ago and100% at the same time last year.   Traders shrugged off developments at the summit meetingbetween President Bush and Soviet President MikhailGorbachev.   &quot;If anything, what happened at the summit was maybe alittle better than expected,&quot; said Mario Balletto, analystfor Merrill Lynch, but &quot;the summit really played no role inthese {price} drops.&quot;   At the summit, Mr. Bush agreed to ease trade restrictionson the Soviet Union, but congressional leaders are stilldemanding that the improvement be made contingent on Moscow'seasing its stance on emigration of Soviet Jews and onLithuania's demands for independence.

Marketparticipants view OPEC's ability to trim its output aspossibly the most crucial factor in the energy market thissummer because of the current huge buildup of crude-oilsupplies. West Texas Intermediate crude for July deliveryended at $17.14 a barrel, off 36 cents. Some traders said thenext technical floor for the July contract is $16.90 abarrel, a level they said could be tested shortly. Gasolineprices also fell, with unleaded for July delivery finishingat 59.58 cents a gallon, down 1.20 cents. News of a fire at aKerr-McGee Corp. refinery in Corpus Christi, Texas, didn'taffect prices, traders said.                                                                                                          PRECIOUS METALS: Gold future prices extended Friday'sdeclines with an across-the-board drop to life-of-contractslows. Silver edged higher, and platinum eased. Trading waslight. August gold ended with a loss of $1.10 an ounce at$362.40 after trading at a new low of $359.60. London priceseased in sympathy with Friday's losses in New York, andLondon's weakness was then reflected again in New York,analysts said. The market also continued to be affected bySoviet sales and possible swaps of gold to try to obtainforeign exchange, one analyst said. Another analyst, GregKlochkoff, vice president of Bank of Boston in Providence,R.I., said traders appeared to waiting to see how much Sovietgold the market could absorb. &quot;I think there will be afurther slight dip and a good chance of some recovery laterin the week,&quot; Mr. Klochkoff said. July silver was up 0.2 centan ounce at $5.0820. &quot;Silver prices have been at an extremelylow level in a vastly oversold market,&quot; said Peter Cardillo,trading adviser at Josephthal andamp; Co., New York. At currentlevels, with prices below production costs, the market may beestablishing a base from which to stage a rally, he said.According to Mr. Cardillo, the same is true of gold, which healso termed an oversold market in which a rebound couldn't becounted out. July platinum was off $1.20 to $486.80 an ounce.                                                                                                          COCOA: Futures prices fell, with the July contract endingwith a loss of $30 a metric ton at $1,317. At one point, thecontract traded as low as $1,283. The strong demand that wasgenerated in recent weeks by political turmoil in the IvoryCoast, the world's leading cocoa producer, has been slackingoff as the political situation has stabilized, according toanalysts. While a quieter Ivory Coast has been the majorprice depressant, the Soviet Union's foreign exchangedifficulties also have played a part, one analyst said.Moscow's reported requests for credit extensions last weekraised the possibility that some of the cocoa the Sovietshave contracted to buy may be resold on the world market, theanalyst said. The Soviet Union accounts for about 7% of worldcocoa consumption, the analyst said.</TEXT></DOC>
