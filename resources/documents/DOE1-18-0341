The bombardment of a solid with energetic ionsinevitably involves the deposition of energy as well as material andthis effect, which results in unwanted effects such as radiation damagein conventional implantation situations, is also being utilized to assistin the deposition of highly adherent or epitaxial layers. The increasingrange of applications of ion implantation and ion assisted processingof materials has placed increasingly stringent demands on machine performance;in the present paper implantation techniques and their applications willbe discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
