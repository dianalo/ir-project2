The majority of the 13 ministers meeting here agreed in principle to freeze the cartel's benchmark price at $18 a barrel -- and to defend the price in the face of slackening demand for OPEC oil through a concerted effort to slash current production levels roughly a million barrels a day to about 17.5 million barrels a day.    But after meeting privately with mediators from other delegations, Iran reasserted its threat to boycott any agreement that fails to increase the benchmark price. Iran also continued ruling out a widely supported Arab-sponsored proposal to increase the production quota of Iraq, with which Iran is engaged in an escalating seven-year war.    &quot;If our objectives are not achieved, we are not going to be a party,&quot; a senior Iranian official said in an interview. &quot;And being outside the agreement, it will create other problems for them,&quot; meaning the remaining members of the cartel. The official ruled out some of the schemes being proposed to keep Iran in the agreement.    Several delegates, however, said they remain intent on securing an agreement quickly -- even at the cost of losing Iran's signature on it. &quot;Nobody wants to go home empty-handed,&quot; said Subroto, the oil minister of Indonesia, in an interview. &quot;An agreement one way or another has to be reached to prevent price deterioration.&quot;    Ministers from Venezuela and Nigeria, as well as Mr. Subroto, undertook what one delegate called a &quot;shuttle diplomacy&quot; mission to resolve differences between the Iranians and the Persian Gulf Arab faction led by Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, which aren't even speaking to the Iranians.    Iran, supported by Algeria, Gabon and Libya, continued demanding an increase in OPEC's benchmark price of more than $2 a barrel to account for inflation and the plunging value of the dollar, in which oil is priced. But only Iran was vehement on the price matter.    &quot;The first essential for us is price,&quot; the Iranian official said.    As previously reported, Iran has threatened to flood the world market with cheap oil if it isn't a party to a final agreement. Despite assertions by industry specialists that the Iranian fields aren't capable of producing oil in such quantities, the Iranian declaration made at the OPEC council table offended even Arturo Hernandez Grisanti of Venezuela, a moderate minister who is serving as a mediator between the widely divergent Iranian and Arab factions.    &quot;Nobody -- any member country -- can threaten us in OPEC,&quot; he snapped on his way to yesterday's ministerial session.    With its production capacity and its markets curtailed because of the war with Iraq, Iran yesterday was seeking oil sales at discounted prices. A source close to the Iranians said the country was offering a huge proportion of its daily production on favorable terms. Representatives of two oil concerns with U.S. refining operations are believed to have met with Iranian officials here yesterday.    Besides coming tentatively to terms on the $18 benchmark, most of the ministers agreed that OPEC's production next year should be held to about 17.5 million barrels a day, perhaps slightly higher, which is within the range of most industry estimates for all of 1988. But how to cut the production ceiling into individual quotas is the toughest task facing the remainder of this conference.    Iran continues to rule out the cornerstone of the proposed new production ceiling, which would increase Iraq's allocation by as much as 800,000 barrels a day -- a move that would in fact reduce Iraq's production because of its open flouting of its oil quota. Iraq has insisted on receiving a quota equal to Iran's, a demand that Iran's oil minister has vowed to approve &quot;under no circumstances.&quot;    Some ministers appreciate Iran's dilemma on this issue, which is extremely controversial in Iran at a time when parliamentary elections are approaching.    &quot;For Iran to agree to parity means suicide for the minister,&quot; the chief of another delegation said. Besides the Iran-Iraq quota question, differences involving other countries and issues remain.    If the ministers go home this weekend, as many of them hope, doubt remains that they can do much more than paper over these issues with an interim agreement and then return early next year to attempt to resolve them long term.    &quot;If worse comes to worst, we'll have a majority agreement&quot; without Iran, said one oil minister. &quot;If that is the best we can do to save the market from total collapse, that is the course we are going to take.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
