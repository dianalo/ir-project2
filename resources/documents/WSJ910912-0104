Separately, Wells Fargo andamp; Co. is also likely to takesignificant charges -- mostly related to lower valuations ofits real estate loans -- by the fourth quarter, analystssaid.</LP><TEXT>   The expected moves, related in part to California'sunfolding recession, could delay any considerations of mergerbetween the two California banking giants, at least for theshort term. But in the long run, the charges could encouragean eventual merger because of big cost savings associatedwith intrastate combinations. A merger isn't planned betweenthe two companies, but certain industry experts feel amarriage of the pair is inevitable now that their two bigrivals, BankAmerica Corp. of San Francisco and SecurityPacific Corp. in Los Angeles, have agreed to merge.   A First Interstate spokesman declined to elaborate on thecompany's restructuring plan.   First Interstate, based in Los Angeles, previously said itwould incur restructuring charges for the third quarter, butdidn't specify the amount. A housecleaning is overdue atFirst Interstate, which suffers from bloated overhead,according to a report by Thomas Hanley, an analyst withSalomon Brothers Inc. He estimated the charge at between $80million and $100 million.   More than 1,200 employees could lose their jobs as aresult of the plan, said Thomas Brown, an analyst withDonaldson Lufkin Jenrette Securities Corp.   The action could trim the bank holding company's operatingexpenses by $200 million annually, Mr. Hanley noted in hisreport. Noninterest expenses ate up nearly 76% of thecompany's second-quarter revenue, compared with about 55% forWells Fargo, an industry leader, and a 64% median rate forthe top 50 banks, according to Montgomery Securities.   The expected loss for the third quarter would be FirstInterstate's second consecutive quarterly disappointment. Thebank holding company took a $295 million loan-loss provisionin the second quarter, mostly stemming from problems at itsNevada and Oregon bank units. The provision resulted in a netloss of $80.3 million, or $1.43 a share. At that time, thecompany also announced a plan to cut its dividend 60% to 30cents a share, effective in the current quarter.   Despite a published report that First Interstate alsoplanned to take loan-loss reserves of up to $300 million,people familiar with the bank said such big additionalcharges were unlikely.   &quot;I don't expect an {unusually large} loss reserve,&quot; saidMr. Brown. &quot;But with this company, given the experience ofthe last 11 years, anything can happen and no one issurprised by quarterly earnings being less than expected.&quot;   A First Interstate spokesman, commenting on the publishedreport, said, &quot;We don't comment on speculation and gossip.&quot;   First Interstate's stock was quoted at $30.625, down 50cents, while Wells Fargo shares fell 12.5 cents to $72.625 inlate composite trading yesterday on the New York StockExchange.   Wells Fargo, meanwhile, faces an &quot;unusually stringent&quot;examination by regulators of its real estate portfolio to beconcluded by the end of the year, said Mr. Hanley. Theexamination could result in big additions to loan-lossreserves, seriously denting or even eliminating most of theSan Francisco company's fourth-quarter earnings, variousanalysts have said.   Examiners have become particularly tough on Californiabanks in the past year. In the second quarter, Wells Fargo'snet income plunged 94% to $14 million, or 21 cents a share,after it was forced to take reserves and write-offs on itsportfolio of highly leveraged transaction loans. But in thepast week, the bank got a reprieve on an ordered write-off ofan $85 million loan to Revco D.S. after examiners decided toclassify it differently, Mr. Brown said.   Wells Fargo Chairman Carl Reichardt, in a memo to bankemployees last month, downplayed the prospects for a mergerwith First Interstate or any other bank anytime soon. &quot;We arein a market where there is plenty of room to grow, even if wenever did another acquisition,&quot; he said.</TEXT></DOC>
