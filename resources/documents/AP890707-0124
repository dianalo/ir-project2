Also Friday, scattered clashes between rival Moslem militias lefttwo people dead and four wounded, police said.   The shelling _ a daily effort to keep ships from supplying theChristian enclave _ killed three people and wounded seven, policesaid.   The casualties from the shelling raised the overall toll to 405people killed and 1,558 wounded since March 8, when the fightingstarted between the Christian forces loyal to the government led byGen. Michel Aoun and Syrian troops backing a rival Moslem Cabinet.   Nabih Berri, head of the Shiite Moslem Amal militia, said in theSyrian capital, Damascus, that he wants to match a shipload ofSoviet-designed Frog-7 missiles as well as T-54 and T-55 tanks hesaid the Christians received Thursday from Iraq.   ``They're not to threaten Syria or any other country,'' he said.``They're to be used against the Lebanese and the parties of thenational coalition,'' an alliance of six Moslem parties.   His vow threatened to escalate the conflict that the Arab Leaguehas been trying to halt. Amal had stayed out of the fighting overthe past 16 weeks.   Christian sources reported in April that Iraq _ Syria's main Arabfoe _ delivered six Frog-7s to the Lebanese Forces, the Christians'main militia.   Syria, which maintains 40,000 troops in Lebanon, demanded thatthe missiles shipped in April be removed because they can hitDamascus, 40 miles from Christian positions in mountains northeastof Beirut. Syria has linked the issue to lifting the naval blockade.   Aoun has not confirmed that his 20,000 mainly Christian troopspossess Frog-7s and his aides have been vague in answering questionsabout the missiles.   Berri made his comments after meeting with Druse Moslem chieftainWalid Jumblatt, who heads the Progressive Socialist party militia.   Berri said he had told Syrian officials that the Christians'missiles were ``aimed at my house, the house of Walid Jumblatt andat the Syrian headquarters'' in Moslem west Beirut.   ``The Syrians must help us. We are their allies. If they cannot,or will not, then it is our right to seek to purchase such advancedweapons from any source,'' Berri said.   He said no official request has been made to the Syrians, butthat he was waiting for President Hafez Assad to return from hissummer residence in the coastal city of Latakia to make the request.   Pro-Iranian militiamen of Hezbollah, or Party of God, andfighters of the Syrian-backed Amal, the mainstream Shiite Moslemmilitia, fought scattered gunbattles in south Beirut's seaside Ouzaidistrict Friday. Police reported two people killed and four wounded.   Police said the fighting broke out after Amal militiamen tried tosell their weekly magazine in Ouzai, a Hezbollah stronghold.   Syrian soldiers ``are trying to separate the combatants,'' said apolice spokesman, who cannot be named in line with standing rules.   The two groups, vying for dominance of the 1.2 million Shiiteswho make up Lebanon's largest single sect, battled for two days inMoslem west Beirut early this week. Three people were killed and 11wounded, by police count.   In another development, a source at Aoun's headquarters saidSyrian intelligence agents captured 32 Christian civilians and 10 ofAoun's soldiers in Moslem sectors of Lebanon on Thursday. Thesource, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the soldiers werereleased Friday.   ``Efforts are under way to obtain the release of the civilians,''he said.</TEXT></DOC>
