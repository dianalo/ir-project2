The authors found that a promising experimentalapproach to this problem is the study of laser-induced particle emissionfrom clean surfaces in an ultrahigh-vacuum environment. An earlier studywas reported on ion and electron emission from a number of insulatorsand wideband gap semiconductors. Multiphoton excitation apparently playsa role in the charged emission. They subsequently obtained evidence thatthe charge emission is caused by multiphoton ionization that takes placein a flux of emitted neutrals leaving the surface. The neutral emissioncomponent is, therefore, more directly related to the laser excitationof the surface.</TEXT></DOC>
