Lung cancer risk estimates are basedupon an initiation-promotion model of carcinogenesis. In the immediatevicinity of a hot particle, calculations indicate that doses may be extremelyhigh, so that all cells are killed and no tumour will arise. At intermediatedistances, however, the probability for lung cancer induction exhibitsa distinct maximum. Risk enhancement factors, computed relative to auniform radionuclide distribution of equal activity, are highest forintermediate activities and hot particles moving in the lung. While therisk from inhalation of /sup 103/Ru hot particles might, indeed, exceedthat from all other exposure pathways of the Chernobyl fall-out, it stilllies within normal fluctuations of radon progeny induced lung cancerrisk.</TEXT></DOC>
