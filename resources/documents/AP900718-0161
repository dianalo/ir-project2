The letter called Tehran's hierarchy a ``medieval dictatorship''and expressed support for the Mujahedeen Khalq, or People's HolyWarriors, based in Iraq. It was signed by 100 Democratic and 62Republican representatives and was sent Tuesday to Mujahedeenleader Massoud Rajavi.   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency and Tehran Radioquoted speaker Mahdi Karrubi as telling parliament, ``It is notknown how foolishly members of the U.S. Congress think or how farthey are from realities.   ``The threat of the U.S. Congress is not worth even an iota tous and the United States and its Congress cannot do a damn thing.''   In their letter, the U.S. lawmakers said ``decisiveness isrequired to confront Tehran's medieval dictatorship.''   They asked Rajavi ``to assure your countrymen that we supporttheir peaceful and democratic aims'' of replacing the government.   Karrubi referred to the Mujahedeen guerrillas as a terroristgroup.   IRNA and the radio, both monitored in Nicosia, quoted him assaying that ``when the United States and its Congress speak highly... on that day we must shed tears.''   Also Wednesday, parliament approved a bill that calls for thedeath sentence for ``economic saboteurs.'' The measure was passedin an effort to control burgeoning bureaucratic corruption.   Teheran radio said the legislation will empower courts to orderthe execution of defendants convicted of ``grand'' frauds, and toimpose prison terms ranging from five to 20 years for minoroffenses.   The bill still must be approved by the 13-member Council ofGuardians, a parliamentary watchdog committee which screenslegislation to determine whether it conforms to Islamic teachingsand the constitution.</TEXT></DOC>
