One case was reported in Switzerland last year andanother this year.;    &quot;We're not extremely astonished,&quot; said Michel Prost, anagriculture ministry technical adviser. &quot;We always thought we'd get it here,either through exportation of infected animals before June 1990 or fromanimal-based feed.&quot;;    The ministry is treating the incident as an isolatedcase. By making the results of the tests public, officials hope to alertgrowers.;    Beef sales in Britain plunged 30 percent, despite governmentassurances that there were no known cases of humans being affected. Herds thathad cases were slaughtered en masse.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Paris  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910302  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  8A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  267  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday March 2, 199100062092,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
