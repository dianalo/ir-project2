If anything,our institutions are operating under some capital standardsthat are tighter than those applied to commercial banks.   The Office of Thrift Supervision has not relaxed itsrules. The loans-to-one-borrower transition period referredto is only available to savings institutions that alreadyhave more capital today than the law requires them to hold in1995. They are hardly a threat to the deposit insurance fund.</LP><TEXT>   Also, there is no requirement in the law that savingsinstitutions hold more capital against certain VeteransAdministration loans (actually the servicing of VA loans inGovernment National Mortgage Association pools of mortgages).The OTS imposed a higher capital requirement on some VA loanservicing, then rescinded its directive so that it couldfollow a congressional mandate to conform capitalrequirements for savings institutions with those for nationalbanks.
