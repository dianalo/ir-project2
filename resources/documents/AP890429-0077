Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani refused to namethe groups or individuals who surrendered but said their numbershave increased since Feb. 15, when the Soviet Union withdrew itsremaining troops from Afghanistan.   ``We are expecting more in the future, maybe a major one verysoon,'' Amani said. He did not say when the 422 guerrillassurrendered or what happened to them.   The U.S.-backed rebels have been fighting since April 1978 tooverthrow the Marxist government of President Najib. There are noreliable estimates on how many total guerrillas there are.   The government also said it recently reached agreements with anumber of village leaders along the Salang Highway, the key supplyroute between the capital and the Soviet border to the north.   The agreements offered each village much-needed food and fuel,provided that government vehicles were allowed to travel unmolestedon the highway. Rebels have consistently attacked governmentvehicles on the road.   The government said the offer, which was repeated in thenational press, was accepted by nearly every village. Only thevillage of Mirbackhat was singled out for refusing.   Amani also reported fighting had occurred in the provinces ofNangahar, Kandahar, Herat and Paktia since Friday night.   The spokesman said rebels fired rockets into the eastern city ofJalalabad, the capital of Nangahar province. The city has beenunder siege since March 6.   Amani said 7,000 rebels have died in the Jalalabad assault,while only 300 soldiers and civilians have been killed. Otherdiplomats have put the government death toll at about 2,500.   They say casualties among the civilians in Jalalabad have beenhigh, but they have not provided estimates.   Jalalabad, 75 miles east of Kabul, once had a population of64,000 but tens of thousands of people have fled to Kabul or intoPakistan.   Amani said three civilians were killed in the latest attack andfive were wounded. He said the Afghan armed forces fired heavyartillery at the rebels, killing 117 and wounding 113.   The Soviet news agency Tass also reported heavy shelling androcket attacks in Kabul, and said that four civilians were killedand three wounded. It said Afghan aircraft and artilleryretaliated, ``putting out of action 230 rebels.'' It did notelaborate.   Tass also said that government forces found a ``considerableamount'' of explosives at various locations in Kabul ``whichextremists intended to use against civilians.''   In the town of Sarobi, between Kabul and Jalalabad, 16 rebelswere killed and 15 were injured others injured, Amani said.
