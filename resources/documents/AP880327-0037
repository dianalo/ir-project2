Bernard L. Barker and Eugenio R. Martinez paved the way for thisdefense by winning reversal of their convictions for a burglarythey conducted on assignment from the Nixon White House.   The 1976 appellate court ruling said the trial court erred bypreventing the two Watergate foot soldiers from putting forth the``good faith'' defense at their trial.   Daniel E. Schultz, the lawyer who represented Barker andMartinez, said in an interview that Iran-Contra defendants RichardV. Secord and Albert Hakim would have the best chance of assertingthe defense.   Secord and Hakim were private businessmen recruited by a WhiteHouse aide, Oliver L. North, to secretly arm the Nicaraguan Contrarebels when such assistance was banned by Congress and to arrangefor covert arms shipments to Iran, which were authorized byPresident Reagan.   Schultz said North also might be able to use the ``good faith''defense because he has asserted that he received lawful directionsfrom his superiors _ his boss at the National Security Council,John M. Poindexter, and the late CIA Director, William J. Casey.   ``I never carried out a single act, not one ... in which I didnot have authority from my superiors,'' North told thecongressional Iran-Contra committees last July 7.   The fourth defendant, Poindexter, would have a difficult timeusing the defense, Schultz said. As North's boss at the NSC,Poindexter was at a level where he was making decisions rather thantaking orders.   In fact, Poindexter told Congress July 16 that he ``personallyapproved'' the diversion of profits from the Iran arms sales to theContras and kept the decision from the president.   ``Secord and Hakim have excellent arguments on a good faithbelief'' of participating in a lawful activity, said JosephdiGenova, the former chief federal prosecutor for the District ofColumbia and now a private attorney.   ``Their orders were from high government officials. It's clearin cases like this that Hakim and Secord will be able to argue theyhad authority to do this.   ``The independent counsel will want to show their perception ofauthority was skewed by their desire to make money.''   The indictment accused the defendants of embezzling more than$17 million from the arms sales to Iran _ the difference betweenthe $30 million paid by the Iranians and the $12.2 million turnedover to the U.S. government.   The grand jury said the defendants conspired to ``secretly anddeceptively'' divert millions of dollars from those profits. Theindictment said that Secord, Hakim and North personally profitedfrom the diversion and that the Nicaraguan Contras receivedassistance in violation of a congressional ban on such aid.   Barker and Martinez were convicted in the September 1971burglary at the office of Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist, Dr. LouisJ. Fielding. Ellsberg was a former Defense Department official wholeaked the secret Pentagon Papers that were critical of the VietnamWar.   The two burglars were part of a secret White House unit _ knownas the plumbers _ that was established to investigate leaks ofclassified information. They also were among the men who broke intothe Democratic Party offices in the Watergate building inWashington.   Barker was a former CIA operative, and Martinez was on a CIAretainer when they were recruited for the Fielding burglary by aWhite House official, E. Howard Hunt.   After their conviction, they appealed successfully to the U.S.Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. They argued thetrial judge erred when he refused to admit the defendants' claim ofa good faith reliance on Hunt's authority to assign them to alawful operation. After the reversal, the government declined toretry the defendants, who had pleaded guilty and served time forthe Watergate break-in.   In the 2-1 appellate opinion, Judge Malcolm Richard Wilkeywrote, ``There was abundant evidence in the case from which thejury could have found that the defendants honestly and reasonablybelieved they were engaged in a top-secret national securityoperation lawfully authorized by a government intelligence agency.''   Schultz said that successful use of the good faith defense mustdepend on the background and knowledge of the defendant assertingit.   In the Barker-Martinez case, the appellate court recognized thatthe assignment from Hunt was entirely consistent with thedefendants' prior covert missions.   ``Both testified at trial that they had no reason to questionHunt's credentials,'' the appeals court said. ``He clearly workedfor the White House and had a well-known background with the CIA.During the entire time they worked for the CIA, neither Barker norMartinez was ever shown any credentials by their superiors. Notonce did they receive written instructions. ...   ``Nevertheless, they testified, their understanding was alwaysthat those operations had been authorized by the government of theUnited States.   ``Hunt's instructions and actions were in complete accord withwhat their previous experience had taught them to expect.''   In the Iran-Contra case, Secord _ a retired Air Force majorgeneral _ had expertise in covert missions. That prior experience,including the way he received assignments, could determine if``there was a red flag for him'' in the Iran-Contra affair, Schultzsaid.   Schultz said Poindexter would have a problem with the good faithdefense because the higher someone rises in job responsibility,``the more suspect your claim of lack of knowledge'' about legality.   ``North is somewhere in the upper middle,'' Schultz said. ``He'snot the legal adviser, he's an operational man. He can present avery credible picture of someone who had every reason to believe''the Iran-Contra decisions were lawful.   If Hakim was not accustomed to covert operations, in which theauthority of the supervisor is rarely questioned, he may actuallyhave a weaker case, Schultz said. Without having received suchassignments, he could be expected to raise questions aboutlawfulness, Schultz said.</TEXT></DOC>
