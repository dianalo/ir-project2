The three arrived late last week for a conference at theUniversity of Hawaii and will probably visit other academic centersin the United States as well, said the State Department official,who spoke on condition of anonymity.   The decision to let North Koreans visit the United States waspart of a policy shift adopted last October at the request of SouthKorea.   The U.S. ally hoped that a gesture from Washington wouldencourage more openness by the North Korean government toward itssouthern neighbor and arch-rival, although contacts so far betweenthe sides have not yielded significant progress.   The United States does not have diplomatic ties with NorthKorea, listing it among a handful of countries that supportterrorism.   Nonetheless, the new U.S. policy lifted a ban on contacts withNorth Korean officials outside the United States, and threemeetings have been held so far between American and North Koreandiplomats in Beijing. The last meeting was Feb. 28, said theofficial.   He said the meetings amounted to an exchange of views and couldnot be termed negotiations, although further meetings are expected.</TEXT></DOC>
