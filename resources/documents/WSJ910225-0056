No more daily briefings, said Defense SecretaryRichard Cheney, no news reports from the field givinginformation that might be helpful to the enemy.   Then on Sunday, Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, the Americancommander, stepped before TV cameras in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia,and gave a short, informative briefing -- just what Mr.Cheney had prohibited.</LP><TEXT>   But if the general, facing a war in which almost all ofthe news appeared to be good, couldn't restrain himself,neither could most of the U.S. allies in the fighting. Wireswere humming from the front as each nation in the allianceand almost each military unit in the field staked claims todramatic breakthroughs, high-speed onslaughts and the captureof thousands of Iraqi prisoners.   The French, for example, gave hourly reports of theprogress of their Daguet division, which they said is holdingthe western end of the alliance's front. And the U.S.Marines, with a long history of both public relations andcombat successes, were almost as informative.   The one component of the allied command receiving theleast attention in the war was the U.S. Army, which, ofcourse, is the outfit doing most of the fighting.   &quot;It was ludicrous and wrongheaded to announce a newsblackout,&quot; says Fred Hoffman, a former Pentagon spokesman. &quot;Idon't remember any precedent for it.&quot;   In imposing the blackout, Mr. Cheney said, &quot;We must assumethat the enemy is confused about what is happening on thebattlefield and it is absolutely essential that we not doanything inadvertently ourselves to clarify the picture forhim.&quot;   This war is different from those this country has foughtearlier, Pentagon officials say, because for the first timecommunication from the battlefield can be instantaneous, withlive TV pictures transmitted around the world by satellite.Such pictures and the words accompanying them could, in Mr.Cheney's words, help Iraqi generals &quot;clarify&quot; what washappening to them.   There are about 1,300 journalists in Saudi Arabia -- 700to 800 at Dhahran, including more than 150 who are working in&quot;pools&quot; with units at the front; and 520 at Riyadh, theallied army headquarters.   How to handle so many journalists in a high-speed,high-tech war in which the enemy can stretch out in itscommand bunkers and watch live reports on the world-wideCable News Network, remains a conundrum for both the militaryand the press.   In 1983, in the short but sharp action to overthrow acommunist government on the little Caribbean island ofGrenada, the military commanders simply forgot, conveniently,to take any reporters with them. The fighting had gone on fortwo days before the press arrived. Many high-ranking Americanmilitary officers, still smarting from the press coverage ofthe long war in Vietnam, think that's the perfect solution.   Traditionally, generals have felt they could win battleseasier without reporters questioning their moves. Gen.Winfield Scott, as an early example, never forgave reportersfor giving away the fact he had chosen Veracruz as the placehe would land to begin his march on Mexico City. GeorgeArmstrong Custer refused to allow a reporter to accompany himto Little Big Horn because he had been disappointed in thereporter's earlier coverage of his exploits.   Journalists generally point to World War II when thousandsof reporters roamed battlefields all over the world, sendingback millions of dispatches, some of them censored. On D-Day,27 American reporters came ashore on the Normandy beaches,including one radio correspondent with a tape recorder.   Live war coverage was highlighted by Edward R. Murrow'svivid rooftop broadcasts of the nighttime bombing of London(but even he had been checked out for reliability by Britishcensors) and by an extraordinary short-wave broadcast from abomber flying over Tokyo in the dying moments of the war.   Even in Vietnam, dramatic videotape from TV crews had tobe flown to Tokyo, where it was processed for broadcast; itusually took 24 hours. Specialists who have examined presscoverage of that war point to two operations when U.S.military authorities &quot;embargoed&quot; media coverage -- OperationDelaware, a small American offensive in April 1968, andOperation Lam Son 719, an ill-fated assault in 1971 by SouthVietnamese troops supported by U.S. helicopters. Generally,though, reporters were free to hitch rides to the front, andreport almost everything they observed.   Most public-opinion polls show Americans tend to agreewith the military on reining in the press. Asked if&quot;restrictions on news reports are a good idea,&quot; 79% of thoseresponding last month to a survey for the Times Mirror Centerfor the People and the Press agreed.   Mr. Hoffman, the former Pentagon spokesman, and othermedia specialists tend to acknowledge the need for a blackoutin the first 12 hours of the ground war. &quot;The reasons areobvious,&quot; says Mr. Hoffman, &quot;almost all the early reports asa war begins turn out to be wrong. It's prudent to hold offfor 12 hours.&quot;   Former war correspondent Peter Braestrup, a specialist inwar coverage, would even limit news coverage for the first 48hours. &quot;I don't care about that kind of delay. All I careabout is that I'm there to watch what's happening and that Iget my report out in a reasonable period of time,&quot; he says.   &quot;You've got to lean over backwards,&quot; says Lawrence Lichty,director of the media studies project at the Woodrow WilsonCenter. &quot;What's an American life worth -- 12 hours, 24 hours?The problem is that with modern technology, anyone can watchTV and maybe learn something from it. There's a potentialthere for doing serious harm to your own cause.&quot;   For all that, Messrs. Braestrup and Lichty question theneed for a full news blackout -- and doubt it will survivefor very long. They agree the least the high command can dois issue a daily communique on the war's progress, a commonpractice in earlier major wars. Pentagon officials promisethey will start providing a regular flow of informationwithin the next few days.   Noting that some official footage of the fighting inVietnam is still not available, Mr. Lichty points out &quot;therewill be millions and millions of feet of combat videotape bythe time this is over. We need assurance we will be able toget a look at all of it.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
