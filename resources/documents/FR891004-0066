The EPA published a Notice ofAvailability in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on June 24, 1988 (53 FR 23791). The comment periodon the draft EIS ended on August 8, 1988. The final EIS contains a comprehensivesummary of the draft EIS, copies of comments received on the draft EISand Western's responses, errata and changes to the draft EIS, and otherinformation. The draft and final EISs are intended to be reviewed together.Western proposes to construct, operate, and maintain approximately 40.9miles of new 345-kV transmission line which would interconnect the existingAntelope Valley Station (AVS)-Charlie Creek 345-kV Transmission Line insouthern McKenzie County with the Dawson County-Dickinson 230-kV TransmissionLine near the town of Belfield in Stark County, North Dakota. The northernterminus of the new line would be the existing Charlie Creek Substation,and the southern terminus would be a new substation near Belfield, NorthDakota. The electrical needs of the Charlie Creek-Williston area are presentlyserved by the AVS-Charlie Creek 345-kV line and several 115-kV transmissionlines from Garrison, Tioga, Wolf Point, and Richland. Distribution to consumersis provided by McKenzie Electric Cooperative and West Plains Electric Cooperative.The need for additional transmission capacity into the area has been demonstratedby operational experience and power system simulation studies. Any outageof the AVS-Charlie Creek tranmission line causes severe low voltages, facilityoverloads, and possible loss of electric service to customers in the CharlieCreek-Williston area. If the Charlie Creek-Belfield transmission line isnot constructed, future system voltages and facility loadings will be unacceptableduring both outage and system intact conditions. The proposed project will provide improved service to area loads, improvesystem reliability, contribute to energy conservation, and provide flexibilityfor future expansion of the transmission system, should it become necessary.Alternatives considered include no action, energy conservation, other generationsources, other transmission systems and technologies, and the proposedaction with routing and design alternatives. Unavoidable adverse effectsof the proposed action would be construction related impacts, primarilyon visual resources and land use. The final EIS was prepared in compliance with all applicable regulations.Copies have been distributed to appropriate Federal, State, and local agencies;elected State officials; Boards of County Commissioners; and interestedgroups and individuals. Copies are maintained for public inspection atWestern offices in Billings, Montana, and Golden, Colorado, and the DickinsonPublic Library at Dickinson, North Dakota. Copies of the draft and finalEISs are available to the public upon request from these Western offices.Interested agencies, organizations, and individuals are encouraged to reviewthe final EIS for adequacy, completeness, and accuracy. Any responses shouldbe sent to Mr. James D. Davies, Area Manager, at the address given above.Responses received after the review period may not be considered in Western'sdecision making process.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued at Golden, Colorado, September 25, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William H.
