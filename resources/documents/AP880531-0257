Last of a series.</TEXT><BYLINE>By TAD BARTIMUS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>KREMMLING, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Against a backdrop of jagged mountains,a columbine-blue sky, and summer meadows bursting with wildflowers, a flash of blinding light.   Myrna Rubelman's diamonds had trapped the sun.   Dressed in a casual T-shirt, baseball cap, fly-fishing vest andslacks, Mrs. Rubelman wore her jewels as she cast an artificial flyinto a classic Colorado trout stream.   Along with her husband, Pete, a periodontist, and two othercouples from Islamorada, Fla., Mrs. Rubelman was on her firstfly-fishing expedition.   ``I love it!'' she said, as a professional guide coached herabout the proper grip on her fly rod and cautioned her not to flickher wrist.   Mrs. Rubelman, like the other financially well-off, physicallyactive, middle-aged vacationers scattered along the crystal-clearstream, had no intention of roughing it in the wilderness.Attentive staff members at Elktrout Lodge hovered nearby to makesure she didn't have to.   The Rubelmans and their friends, Julian and Polly Unger, andHank and Joy Brown, are among a growing number of affluentAmericans on the lookout for superb fly fishing.   It doesn't matter whether they are beginners or experts. Theywant to catch plenty of fish in a beautiful setting. (Trout,salmon, and steelhead don't live in ugly places.) They want to eatwell and sleep well while they're doing it. Their hosts mustprovide all, perhaps more than, the comforts of home.   That was the idea behind Elktrout when Andy Shepard, a SantaRosa, Calif., banking executive, and some of his friends pooledresources and built an elegant lodge on the banks of the ColoradoRiver in 1982.   At first, the dozen investors intended Elktrout to be a privatehaven just for them, their families, and their friends. Theystarted buying river frontage along the Colorado and severalsmaller streams near the farming town of Kremmling, located twohours northwest of Denver on the western slope of the ContinentalDivide.   Today Elktrout is a luxurious log compound which accommodates upto 20 guests willing to pay $1,375 for five days of some of thefinest fly fishing in the world.   For their money, anglers cast into more privately owned fishingwater than they can find at any other lodge in the American West.   Elktrout's holdings include five miles of blue-ribbon ColoradoRiver water, three miles of gold medal water on the Blue River,nine lakes, and numerous creeks with names like Cataract andTroublesome.   Trout that lunge at the guests' artificial flies are commonly 16to 24 inches long, weigh up to 5 pounds, and fight like the wildcreatures they are. Nearly all the fish caught by Elktrout anglers,except trout kept in special ``dinner'' ponds, are released.Exceptions are trophy fish.   A day's fishing is pleasantly interrupted by a gourmet picniclunch at tables set beside the stream, an evening gathering aroundthe huge rock fireplace, and afterward a candlelight dinner.   ``Probably less than 10 percent of our guests know anythingtechnical about fly fishing,'' says Steve Herter, Elktrout'sresident manager. ``We provide instruction and let them discoverthe sport on their own. We have all the equipment they need righthere in our Orvis store, and we will talk fly fishing to them foras long as they'll listen.''   Elktrout also offers three-day intensive Orvis fly-fishingclinics run by The Flyfisher, Inc., a Denver dealer, for $475 perperson.   Herter said Elktrout's bookings are growing ``by leaps andbounds. We're getting a very good cross section of clientele in the40-to-60-year range. Some are older, wealthy couples, a lot areup-and-coming professionals who are intrigued by the sport, and alot more women are interested in learning about fly fishing. Weeven have one lady from Texas who comes here to fish while herhusband sits on the bank and reads books.''   Another devoted fly fisherwoman is Susie Fitzgerald, co-ownerwith her husband, Mike, of a specialty travel company in Wexford,Pa.   ``Frontiers'' is a 20-year-old firm that caters to wealthyoutdoorsmen and women who want to experience fishing, hunting, andphotography...``from the pristine trout waters of New Zealand tothe historic chalk streams of England and Normandy...   ``From the prolific bonefish flats of Christmas Island and theCaribbean to the Atlantic salmon rivers of Iceland...   ``From the big trout of Tierra del Fuego and alpine Patagonia tothe best waters of Alaska and the American West...''   Prices per person can run into thousands of dollars. Last yearmore than 4,000 customers used Frontiers' services to arrangefly-fishing vacations around the globe.   ``The demand just keeps increasing,'' says Mrs. Fitzgerald. ``Weare always exploring new areas because interest in the sport isconstantly growing, particularly in salt water fly fishing, wherewe've seen the biggest jump in our business.''</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
