The 77-count indictment against the former AmericanContinental Corp. chairman and four former associates camethe same day the Securities and Exchange Commission accusedMr. Keating and nine others of insider trading and fraud in acivil lawsuit. The SEC also named David Paul, former chairmanand chief executive of CenTrust Savings Bank, in the firstcase that charges both men, who have come to symbolize theexcesses that led to the thrift debacle. CenTrust, based inMiami, is now defunct.                                                                                                          Yesterday's federal indictment against Mr. Keating, whowas convicted just last week on narrower state securitiesfraud charges, centered on five separate racketeeringschemes.   At the crux of the government's case was an alleged systemof land swaps that created phony profits for AmericanContinental and its Lincoln Savings and Loan Associationunit. The government also charged that Mr. Keating and theothers siphoned off $975,000 from the company for theirpersonal use, even as American Continental prepared in 1989to seek bankruptcy-law protection.   Prosecutors charged that at American Continental, &quot;thepurpose of the pattern of racketeering activity was to obtainmoney from and through Lincoln, for the use and benefit ofthe {defendants} and certain of their associates and familymembers.&quot;   Additionally, federal prosecutors accused Mr. Keating andthe others of deceiving buyers of about $200 million ofAmerican Continental bonds. The defendants conveyed &quot;flatlyinconsistent stories about ACC's financial prospects&quot; topurchasers of senior and subordinated notes, the indictmentsaid.   Under the scheme described by the government, thedefendants tried to convince buyers of senior notes to sellthem back to the company at a discount, telling them thatAmerican Continental was financially troubled even as theyassured buyers of the junior debt that the company was sound.   When American Continental filed for bankruptcy-courtprotection in April 1989, the subordinated bonds becamenearly worthless. Misstatements to buyers of about $250million of those notes formed the basis of Mr. Keating'sconviction on California charges that he was responsible formisleading investors, many of them retirees on fixed incomes.His attorney, Stephen C. Neal, has said he will appeal.   Others indicted yesterday on the federal charges were JudyWischer, former American Continental president; AndrewLigget, its former chief financial officer; Robert M.Wurzelbacher, Mr. Keating's son-in-law and former companysenior vice president, and Charles H. Keating III, Mr.Keating's son and former company executive vice president.   The elder Mr. Keating was unable to post bail, set at $2million, and was taken into federal custody. All fivedefendants are scheduled for arraignment Monday.   Lincoln, once the main subsidiary of Mr. Keating'sPhoenix, Ariz.-based company, was seized by federalregulators in April 1989, a day after American Continentalfiled for bankruptcy-court protection. The failure of LincolnSavings is expected to cost taxpayers $2.6 billion, thelargest such bailout in history.   &quot;Fraudulent business practices were really the order ofthe day at Lincoln and at ACC,&quot; said U.S. Attorney Lourdes G.Baird. &quot;They victimized not only purchasers of bonds, butalso the millions of American citizens who will be leftholding the bag.&quot;   Talking to reporters outside the courtroom, Mr. Keating'sattorney, Mr. Neal, said: &quot;The indictment is an effort toretroactively criminalize a whole host of investmenttransactions that were legitimate when made. They were farmore economically sound than the prosecutors would lead youto believe.&quot;   Attorneys for the other defendants couldn't immediately bereached.   The government is also seeking forfeiture of some $265.6million Mr. Keating purportedly obtained through the allegedracketeering activity. Ms. Baird said no property has beenseized, but she declined comment as to whether Mr. Keatingand the others retain any valuable holdings. Mr. Keating hassaid he is broke.   The government's account of the alleged land-swap schemedetailed six separate sales totaling about $82 million,including three transactions in an area southeast of Phoenix,Ariz., known as Hidden Valley. In those deals, a Lincolnsubsidiary allegedly sold property at a price far abovemarket value to third parties, with the subsidiary promisingto reimburse the purchaser for any down payment and the Sandamp;Lproviding much of the financing.   Sham profits from all the alleged sales triggered some $32million in cash payments from Lincoln to its parent under atax-sharing agreement that required Lincoln to make paymentsto its parent based on a percentage of the thrift's profits,the indictment said. Many of the payments were purportedlymade earlier than the agreement had called for. &quot;By makingthese premature payments, Lincoln in effect paid ACCunauthorized dividends in the form of interest-free loans, tothe detriment of Lincoln&quot; and the benefit of AmericanContinental, the indictment said.   In detailing the alleged $975,000 &quot;insider loans scheme,&quot;the indictment said the defendants began transferring the$975,000 to themselves early in 1989. To prevent thetransfers from being challenged by the company's creditors,the indictment said, Mr. Keating and others disguised them asloans from a shell company, Medema Homes of Utah. In reality,the grand jury charged, the defendants knew that the moneywas really coming from American Continental and that therecipients hadn't any intention of ever repaying.   On March 7, 1989, for example, just slightly over a monthbefore the company filed for protection from creditors,Medema transferred about $300,000 to the elder Mr. Keating.   In the separate SEC civil case against Mr. Keating, whichalso names his five co-defendants in the criminal case andfour others, the agency charged Mr. Keating with insidertrading in connection with the sale of $7.5 million inAmerican Continental common stock. The charge relates to SECclaims that Mr. Keating sold more than 680,000 common sharesbetween January 1986 and November 1987 while in possession ofnon-public information about the company's true financialposition.   That suit, also filed in Los Angeles, says that AmericanContinental overstated its earnings by more than $120 millionin financial statements from 1985 through 1988. It furtheralleges that the defendants violated anti-fraud laws inconnection with the sale of the subordinated debenturesthrough Lincoln.   Others named in the SEC action were Robert Kielty,American Continental's former president and chief operatingofficer; Jack Atchison, a former senior vice president and aformer Arthur Young andamp; Co. partner; James Upchurch, acertified public accountant who had various responsibilitiesat American Continental, and Mark Sauter, a former in-houseattorney at the company.   The suit in Los Angeles also charged Mr. Paul, the formerCenTrust chairman, with helping American Continentalimproperly report a gain of $24.6 million on the sale ofsecurities during the second quarter of 1988.   ---   Sandra Block in Washington contributed to this article.</LP><TEXT/></DOC>
