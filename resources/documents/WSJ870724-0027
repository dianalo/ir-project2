KarrStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 07/24/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> LABORCONGRESS (CNG) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee approved a controversial bill that would require employers to notify workers if they've been exposed to high levels of chemicals or other potentially disease-causing hazards.    The 11-5 vote came after a protracted series of final committee sessions on the bill, during which Republican critics of the measure offered a raft of amendments Democratic backers said were often designed to scuttle the legislation.    Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio) had labeled as a &quot;killer&quot; one amendment, offered by Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah), that proposed ordering the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to curb &quot;passive&quot; smoking in the workplace within a year. A consumer health group has petitioned OSHA, an arm of the Labor Department, to ban smoking in work locations.    Sen. Metzenbaum, chairman of the Senate Labor subcommittee and sponsor of the bill, argued that such a proposal should be dealt with in separate legislation, and didn't belong in the high-risk notification measure. Opponents of the Hatch amendment, which was killed earlier this week, said it would draw opposition for the labor-related bill from the tobacco industry, worsening its chances of enactment.    The House Labor Committee approved a similar notification bill late in May. Under both versions, the risk of disease would be established by a risk-assessment board to be formed by the Health and Human Services Department. Backers of the measures say that many workers don't know they've had such exposure, either because they've left the company where it occurred, or because a current employer hasn't told them.    Employers contend, however, that such notification would provoke widespread lawsuits. They add that much of the litigation would be based on claims of psychological stress resulting from employees learning of the exposure.    The Metzenbaum bill is one of a package of provisions unions are promoting, after similar bills failed to make it through Congress in recent years. While there is widespread opposition from employer and some insurance groups, mainly over the liability question, Sen. Metzenbaum has succeeded in lining up support from some electronics and chemical groups, and lately also has gained the backing of the American Medical Association. </TEXT></DOC>
