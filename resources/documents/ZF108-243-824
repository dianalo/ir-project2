(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Don't let printer controllers control youandM;Until recently, the 30-to-50-page-per-minute (ppm) printer market has been apredictable and profitable haven for systems integrators.andP;  Besides being thefastest growing part of the high-end, non-impact printer world, the30-ppm-to-50-ppm segment offered controller experts almost limitlessintegration opportunities.andM;In the past year or so, however, emerging user requirements and advances incontroller technology have begun to make the 30-ppm-to-50-ppm market atougher and lot less certain place.andM;In order to improve margins and make their printers less of a commodityproduct, many printer vendors have begun to build their own engines,controllers or both.andP;  They claim that, as controllers become morepowerful--with features such as built-in small computer systems interface(SCSI) ports for linking printers to hard disks loaded with variousfonts--it's preferable to house them directly within printer units, asopposed to putting them in external blacks boxes.andM;Result: Printer vendors are increasingly doing the engine-controllerintegration--formerly the exclusive domain of systems integrators--by reasonof default.andM;Favoring VARs and integrators is the fact that Japanese companies still makequite a few of the most commonly employed 30-ppm-to-50-ppm engines.andP;  And, sofar, their record in selling printers through direct channels outside ofJapan has been dismal.andM;Accordingly, companies with solid products, such as Canon U.S.A.andP;  Inc.,andO;Hitachi America Ltd., Minolta Corp., Ricoh Corp. and Toshiba America Inc.andO;have needed--and probably will continue to need--OEMs and integrators to helpmove their engines via integration with various vendors' controllers.andM;Fujitsu America Inc., San Jose, is a case in point.andP;  In late 1988, Fujitsuintroduced to the United States its Model M3773NA laser engine.andP;  A full yearlater, Fujitsu had signed up only two U.S.andP;  companies to resell this 50-ppmproduct--Advanced Technologies International Inc. (ATI), Milpitas, Calif.,andO;and a yet-to-be-announced federal OEM.andM;Not too expensiveandM;In theory, the Fujitsu laser engine should be attractive to vendors andintegrators.andP;  It's considered extremely reliable, with an average mean timebetween failures (MTBF) of 1,200 hours, despite its heavy 500,000page-per-month duty cycle.andP;  It can operate at either 240-dot-per-inch or300-dot-per-inch (dpi) resolution.andP;  With an OEM price of slightly under$80,000, the laser engine is on the expensive side, but not excessively so.andM;Originally, Fujitsu planned to offer the product as a complete print system,integrated with one of three Fujitsu-developed controllers.andP;  But morerecently, Fujitsu has dropped its engine-controller integration plans.andM;&quot;We didn't feel we'd have much luck in selling through [VARs] a product towhich they couldn't add value,&quot; explains Fujitsu's James Milne, director ofnon-impact products.andP;  By selling the engine to controller vendors and otherintegrators, &quot;The product can be positioned however the OEM or systemsintegrator wants,&quot; he adds.andM;ATI, a Fujitsu OEM, has lined up behind the engine-maker's strategy.andP;  Itbegan volume production in November 1988 of its LC-6050 printer, which isbased on the Fujitsu 50-ppm M3773NA engine.andP;  ATI integrated the engine withits home-grown LC-6000 controller--the same one it hooks to the 26-ppmToshiba engine, which it has been reselling for the past three years.andP;  Thecompany also expects to use the LC-6000 in the 40-ppm Nissei Sangyo AmericaLtd.-Hitachi printer that it plans to introduce this year.andM;Curt Burkett, CEO of ATI, says his company product supports allindustry-standard text emulations, including Hewlett-Packard Co. LaserJet +and HPGL, Tektronix Inc. 4014 and various models from Xerox Corp., such asits Diable division's model 630.andP;  ATI offers RS232C, Dataproducts Corp.,andO;Genicom Corp.'s Centronics and IBM Corp. twinaxial, coaxial andchannel-attach interfaces.andP;  And ATI is slated to add SCSI support during thefirst quarer of 1990.andM;Additionally, ATI adds value to its various engines via its Native Modesoftware.andP;  Native Mode is a developer toolkit that enables integrators andusers to circumvent emulation modes when writing new drivers.andM;&quot;We're not going after the line-printer replacement market,&quot; as many30-ppm-to-50-ppm vendors do, Burkett says.andP;  &quot;We offer capabilities that arefar above what that marketplace needs.&quot;andM;Target market needsandM;Determining these marketplace needs is hardly as clear-cut as it used to be.andO;The 30-ppm-to-50-ppm market is in a state of flux and has emerged as thefastest growing part of the high-end, non-impact world, says John Boldt, anindustry analyst at Dataquest Inc. of San Jose.andP;  Boldt calculates thecompound annual growth rate (CAGR) for the segment at 33.5 percent from 1989to 1992.andM;To date, the same handful of printer companies with the same basic productshave ruled the market.andP;  According to market researchers at ComputerIntelligence Inc., La Jolla, Calif., the top three (in terms of number ofinstallations) are Hewlett-Packard with its 2680, 2685 and 2689; Xerox withits Model 4050; and Digital Equipment Corp., Maynard, Mass., with itsPrintServer 40 and 40 Plus lines.andM;Engine technology in this segment, too, has remained stable.andP;  Laser hasbecome more reliable and economical--thus, more prevalent.andP;  But sister printtechnologies, such as ion deposition, light-emitting diode (LED) array andelectro-magnetography--from Bull HN Information Systems Inc., have managed tohold their own.andP;  the 30-ppm-to-50-ppm market, in particular, demonstratesthat these so-called post-laser technologies have continued to be strongsellers.andM;Less staid marketandM;Vendors have traditionally positioned these 30-ppm-to-50-ppm printers almostentirely as replacements for impact line-printers.andP;  They have configured themas centralized, departmental machines designed to run large-volume batchapplications, such as accounting dumps, billings and end-of-the-monthreports.andM;However, in the past year or so, the market's become far less staid.andP;  Infact, today, the top items on many users' wish list are SCSI support and fastPostScript support from Adobe Systems Inc.andP;  These requests were previouslyunheard of in the high-end, non-impact arena.andM;At the same time, the channel-attach empire has begun to crumble, and inresponse to customer demand, vendors have begun to add true networkingcapabilities to their printers.andP;  This has been accomplished via external&quot;smart boxes&quot; (see SYSTEMS INTEGRATION, November 1989, Page 48) or viaembedded-controller enhancements.andM;&quot;In a couple of years, users with large local area network installations willbe routinely using 50-ppm models for production/remote printing,&quot; predictsDavid Hudson, an analyst with the Norwell, Mass., market-research company ofBIS CAP International.andM;&quot;The market is radically changing,&quot; concurs Fred Collins, director of salesand marketing at C. Itoh Electronics Inc., Irvine, Calif.andP;  &quot;The stronghold ofmore generalist-type, traditional distributors is being eroded by systemsintegrators and OEMs.&quot;andP;  Trying to support all of the drivers that customersare requesting these days is next to impossible, Collins says.andP;  As a result,he adds, &quot;A more vertical-marketing approach is needed.&quot;andM;C.andP;  Itoh has already felt this shift in its own business.andP;  It currently sells40 percent of its MegaLine, MegaPro and MegaServe 30/45-ppm printers throughthe traditional distributor channel.andP;  The remaining 60 percent go throughOEMs and systems integrators.andM;All three families are based on C. Itoh's own 3030 (30 ppm) or 4530 (45 ppm)ion-deposition engines: All three families offer 300-by-300-dpi resolution.andO;C. Itoh positions the Mega Line almost solely as a line-printer replacement.andO;The MegaPro supports some custom features and digitized data.andP;  Thetop-of-the-line MegaServe, introduced in 1988, is primarily configured aspart of large networks.andM;&quot;The difference in the products is in the controllers,&quot; Collins acknowledges.andO;C. Itoh builds its own controllers for the MegaLine and MegaPro models;Talaris Systems Inc., San Diego, manufactures and integrates the controllerthat C. Itoh resells with the MegaServe.andM;The MegaPro family features HP LaserJet + and Diablo 630 emulations.andP;  TheMegaServe handles ANSI X3.64, DEC LN03 Plus, Diablo 630 FCS, HP LaserJet II,HPGL and Tektronix 4014 emulations.andP;  Available interface ports range from thestandard Centronics and Dataproducts on the MegaLine and MegaPro, toCentronics, Dataproducts, RS232/RS422, Ethernet and SCSI on the MegaServe.andM;Remember the VARandM;Another vendor that has adopted a do-it-yourself engine-controllerintegration approach is Miltope Business Products Corp., Melville, N.Y.andO;Sixty percent of its sales are nonetheless generated through VARs, says BobCeonzo, director of marketing.andM;Miltope's Series 30 products are based on the Delphax Systems 3000, a 30-ppmion-deposition engine.andP;  The model L is a line-replacement model: The model Mis a cut-sheet machine with graphics-handling capabilities.andP;  Its 37-ppmSeries 37, introduced in 1988, is also based on the Delphax 3000.andP;  Bothproduct lines offer resolutions of 300 by 300 dpi.andM;And Miltope integrates its own Advanced Function Controller with both theSeries 30 and Series 37.andP;  Result: The Series 30 products can handleemulations including IBM 3211, 3287, 2780/3780, 522; HP LaserJet II, HPGL;and Dataproducts BP 1500.andP;  The Series 37 accommodates all the sameemulations, minus HPGL.andM;Models in both series offer Centronics, Dataproducts, IBM (Systems NetworkArchitecture, 3270, System/3X and 3770), as well as other multi-interfaceoptions.andP;  Miltope also offers resellers and end-users two customforms-development programs along with its products.andM;Still another vendor that's doing its own engine-controller development andintegration is NBS Southern Inc., Largo, Fla.andP;  NBS integrates ion-depositionengines purchased from Delphax with its home-grown M-II raster-imagecontroller.andM;Currently, NBS sells the controller in combination with its 40-ppm and 80-ppmmodels.andP;  According to NBS' vice president of sales, Richard Busbee, it alsomade its first deliveries of M-II to several worldwide companies in 1988.andM;NBS claims that the M-II can drive any non-impact printer ranging from 20 ppmto 350 ppm.andP;  A custom, bit-slice raster-image processor is at the heart ofNBS' controller.andP;  A coprocessor is used to control the operation of thefloppy disk or tape drive, to load microcode for itself and the rasterprocessor and to provide a control-panel link.andM;Additionally, NBS is positioning the 40-ppm 3840D primarily as a line-printerreplacement.andP;  It offers 300-dpi or 240-dpi resolution options.andP;  Standard hostinterfaces include:  ANSI X.364, Centronics, Dataproducts, DEC VAX, IBMchannel-attach (S370, 4300, 30xx), System/3X and AS/400.andP;  NBS is looking atadding other interfaces to the four-year-old M-II, Busbee says.andP;  He mentionsHitachi as one possibility.andM;Handles entire projectandM;DEC like all the major hardware companies, handles not only theengine-controller integration, but the entire printing system integration.andO;It sells its PrintServer 40 and PrintServer 40 Plus products as completelyintegrated packages.andP;  These packages encompass everything from the MicroVAXCPU chip around which each printer is built, to the supporting DEC computersand software that drive the printers.andM;With the July 1989 announcement of the DECprint program, DEC broadened itsdefinition of &quot;integrated&quot; even further by including other companies'computers and printers in its printing architecture plans (See &quot;High-endprinting: The problem is software&quot;).andM;As with other 30-ppm-to-50-ppm printers, the controller is what makes thePrintServers tick.andP;  Inside each printer is a Q-bus Ethernet controller boardwith three special-function add-in boards.andP;  The controller is populated witha souped-up MicroVAX chip, a TTL bit-slice processor, a 20-MHz 8-bitprocessor, 256K bytes of RAM for font cache, 2.5M bytes of dedicated bit-mapgraphics RAM and an 8-bit processor that reads the bit-map.andM;&quot;A product of this magnitude usually is purchased as part of a completesystem,&quot; says Len Winmill, an in-house marketing consultant for DEC'sWestford, Mass., desktop systems group.andM;Try to add valueandM;In fact, Winmill admits that the only reason DEC makes use of the resellerchannel with the PrintServers is because of the products' use asdepartmental, rather than production (i.e.andP;  line printer) systems.andP;  &quot;For thisproduct family, value-added comes through sales of an entire printsystem--including integration and software,&quot; he says.andP;  Consequently,integrators and resellers intent on selling DEC high-end printers must have aproduct line that includes DEC computers and software.andM;Other integrators might find it more feasible to focus on the service/supportside in order to assure themselves of a place in the high-end printer world.andO;Imageworks, Newburyport, Mass., for example, handles the selection, serviceand support for a variety of Dataproducts and Miltope printers.andM;According to president Jerry Pinsky, Imageworks has recently decided to addvalue across the board--in software, hardware and consulting.andP;  This meansImageworks will be coupling software drivers with controllers and engines--anew area of specialization for the company.andP;  This way, Pinsky says,Imageworks can beat printer vendors themselves in trying to address morespecialized niches.andM;Sometimes, a high-end printer reseller needs to locate only one of thedwindling number of vendors hungry for third-party partners to hook up with.andO;C. Itoh is a good example.andP;  Even though it does its own engine-controllerintegration, it still wants to develop thrid-party relationships, marketingdirector Collins says.andP;  In addition to its deal with Talaris, C. Itoh hascontracts with numerous DEC-compatible controller and IBM-compatibleprotocol-converter manufacturers.andM;Creative Controllers Inc. (CCI) of Picayune, Miss., for one, makescontrollers that link C. Itoh printers with IBM System/34, System/36,System/38 and AS/400 systems.andP;  (It also sells controllers for such companiesas Dataproducts, Fujitsu, Hitachi, HP, Mannesmann Tally and Printronix Inc.)andO;It offers both external-box and internal-board versions of its products.andM;Unlike many controller companies, CCI doesn't do any engine-controllerintegration.andP;  Instead, it sells its boards and boxes to printer vendors (likeC. Itoh), wholesalers and retailers and leaves the integration to them.andM;Changing technologies also mean a shot at new business.andP;  Many printers in the30-ppm-to-50-ppm range are at the end of their life cycle.andP;  This could begood news for resellers with the knowhow to support or integrate them withother hardware--a chore many printer manufacturers may not want to handlethemselves.andM;C.andP;  Itoh's Collins says to watch the 30-ppm-to-50-ppm market for advances inpaper-handling technology, dpi resolution and networking capabilities.andO;Resellers that understand and support these changes will be in demand, hesays.andP;  SCSI and fast PostScript support (for non-PostScript-dedicatedprinters) also are areas in which resellers might consider specializing,since more and more users are asking about them.andM;Finally, as many integrators are discovering, non-impact printers below 20ppm are coming on strong.andP;  Many industry watchers are beginning to adviseresellers to cultivate expertise in this segment to complement their work atthe high-end.andM;As BIS CAP's Hudson notes, however, the best way for 30-ppm-to-50-ppmintegrators and resellers to survive is to &quot;keep up that good sales andservice reputation.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
