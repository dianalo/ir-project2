Analogy between two-dimensional models of quantum fieldtheory and polyacetylene model is drawn. Some consequences of this analogyare considered. The problem of a charge localized on a soliton is discussed.The mechanism of fractional charges and some theoretical models for descriptionof dielectric - metal transition in polyacetylene are considered. Experimentaldata on investigation of this transition are discussed. 117 refs.; 35figs.</TEXT></DOC>
