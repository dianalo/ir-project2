Thedecision was made to use the checklist as a locator reference insteadof using the checklist section numbers as paragraph section numbers becauseseveral different types of waste management units, some of which arenot addressed in the checklists, are part of the GTF. The GTF is a wastemanagement unit within the Hanford Site facility. In May 1988, a permitapplication was filed that identified the GTF as an existing facility.The GTF mixes dry cementitious solids with liquid wastes (containingboth dangerous and radioactive constituents) produced by Hanford Siteoperations. In addition to the design and operating features of the GTFthat are intended to meet the requirements of dangerous waste regulations,many additional design and operating features are necessary to complywith radioactive waste management practices. The GTF design featuresand practices are intended to keep operational exposure to radionuclidesand dangerous substances ``as low as reasonably achievable'' (ALARA)and to provide a disposal system that protects the environment for atleast 10,000 yr. In some instances, ALARA practices present difficultieswhen complying with requirements of dangerous waste regulations. Thisvolume contains 14 Appendices. Topics include Engineering Drawings, Maps,Roads, Toxicity Testing, and Pilot-Scale Testing.</TEXT></DOC>
