The Army decision follows an intense competition in which the two companies faced off with another industry team consisting of Textron Inc. and the Pratt andamp; Whitney unit of United Technologies Corp.    The winners -- Allied's Garrett Engine division and GM's Allison Gas Turbine division -- will form a partnership known as Light Helicopter Turbine Engine Co. to develop the new T800 engine. The Army awarded the partnership a $75.4 million contract to work on the project over the next two years.    After the new partnership has developed the engine, the companies will split up and set up separate production lines. They will then compete annually to produce the engines. The Army plans to buy 5,000 T800 engines between 1995 and 2005, with the cost expected to total billions of dollars.    Robert Kirk, chairman and chief executive officer of Allied-Signal's aerospace subsidiary, applauded the Army selection as &quot;a very significant win for us.&quot;    Meanwhile, the Army extended $158 million to two industry teams to develop an airframe for the LHX. One team is a joint venture by Boeing Co.'s helicopter unit and United Technologies' Sikorsky division. The other team consists of McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Inc. and McDonnell Aircraft Co., both units of McDonnell Douglas Corp.; and Bell Helicopter Textron Inc., a unit of Textron. The Army expects to pick one of these two competing teams in December 1989 to produce 2,096 LHX helicopters.    The Army a year ago scaled back its LHX helicopter program because of technological uncertainties and budget constraints. Originally, the Army wanted two types of LHX helicopters, a reconnaissance aircraft and an assault helicopter. The program would have added up to 4,100 helicopters. Currently, the Army is proceeding only with the LHX reconnaissance helicopter.    In other contracts awarded Friday, Mitre Corp. got a $387.2 million Air Force contract for communications systems engineering.    Lockheed Corp. was awarded a $28.5 million Air Force contract for two C-130 aircraft for the Marines. The company's Lockheed Missiles andamp; Space Co. unit also won a $17.1 million Army contract for space defense parts.    Hercules Engine Inc. won a $22.5 million Army contract for trucks.    Ori Inc. received a $17.1 million Navy contract for submarine services. </TEXT></DOC>
