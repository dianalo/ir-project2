Intron-A is the trade name for interferon alfa, agenetically engineered copy of a human protein that acts asan antiviral agent. It is already on the market for treatmentof hairy cell leukemia, AIDS-related sarcoma and genitalwarts.</LP><TEXT>   Hepatitis C (also known as non-A, non-B hepatitis) isusually contracted through contact with infected blood orblood products. If it reaches chronic stages, it can lead tocirrhosis, liver failure and death.   The government based its approval on results of a clinicaltrial involving 166 people with chronic hepatitis C who weregiven injections of interferon alfa for six months. Abouthalf of the study group treated with high doses showedimprovement, based on levels of an enzyme in the blood thatis specific to liver cell damage, according to the FDA.   Schering-Plough closed at $50, up $2.875, in New YorkStock Exchange composite trading on volume of 2.1 millionshares.   Marc Meyer, a drug-industry analyst at Sanford C.Bernstein andamp; Co., said the FDA approval is the beginning of atrend for wider use of the drug. However, he said he isconcerned that Intron-A's sales might be limited by the factthat Hepatitis C is a disease that tends to strike peoplefrom the lower economic strata. Estimates are that between500,000 and 750,000 Americans suffer from this disease, andMr. Meyer says about 40% of those tend to be intravenous drugusers. He declined to give projections on Intron-A's salesgrowth as a result of the FDA approval, but saidSchering-Plough's sales of the drug last year exceeded $150million.   Meanwhile, Jeffrey Swarz of Goldman Sachs andamp; Co. expectsSchering-Plough's Intron-A sales to reach $285 million thisyear. He adds that Biogen Inc., which developed the product,should get &quot;significant royalties&quot; on Intron-A sales. Mr.Swarz estimates Biogen will get about $64 million this yearin royalties from all products, not just Intron-A.</TEXT></DOC>
