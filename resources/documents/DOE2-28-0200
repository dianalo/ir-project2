It presentsa structured, simplified approach for identifying the most-serious potentialhazards and for calculating their effect distances or damage ranges.It is the intention that by presenting a simplified approach, the manualshould be amenable to use by engineers and scientists with little orno experience of hazard analysis. Further analysis with a view to mitigationof the hazards identified may be appropriate in many cases; at this stage,it may be necessary to seek the advice of a specialist. The basic procedurein a hazard analysis is: identify potential failures, calculate releasequantities for each failure, and calculate the impact of each releaseon people and property. For large plants this can become highly complex,and therefore a simplified method is presented, in which the analysishas been divided into 14 steps. A spreadsheet technique was devised topermit the analyses to be carried out on a programmable calculator orpersonal computer. After the introductory material, the manual outlinesthe 14 steps that make up the hazard analysis.</TEXT></DOC>
