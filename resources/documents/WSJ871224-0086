Leo W. Ladehoff can tell you why.    &quot;Business is brisk, profits are rising, and cash flow is improving,&quot; the chief executive officer of Amcast Industrial Corp. says.    The Dayton, Ohio, maker of pipe fittings, vehicle parts and other products plans to raise its outlays 20% next year, to $12 million or so, for equipment that will help reduce costs and eliminate production bottlenecks. Amcast's capital spending and the stock market, Mr. Ladehoff says, &quot;are two disconnected events.&quot;    The market's Oct. 19 plunge, of course, has made many executives charting their investment plans somewhat wary. That's why capital spending may rise less than the 7.3% that a recent Commerce Department survey projected. The quarterly survey was mailed before Black Monday, and many of the responses didn't reflect the stock market crash.    Nevertheless, most companies say they intend to push on with ambitious investment plans. Many are flush with cash and see plenty of profitable opportunities. With business &quot;very exciting now&quot; for molded plastic products, Phillips Plastics Corp., for one, &quot;will be adding capacity in 1988,&quot; says Robert Cervenka, the president of the Phillips, Wis., company.    &quot;The people I talk to don't pay much attention to the stock market,&quot; he says.    Some economists who track capital goods expect business investment to provide one of the strongest elements next year, helping push the economy through another year of expansion despite sluggish consumer spending.    They see fixed nonresidential investment -- a broad measure of capital spending -- rising to the $465 billion to $470 billion range in 1982 dollars from $443.8 billion in 1986. This year's spending figure isn't available yet, but economists say outlays will rise about 1%.    &quot;The real issue is whether the momentum in capital-goods orders and appropriated funds will be reversed by the market decline,&quot; says Richard D. Rippe, senior vice president and economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. His view: No, &quot;given favorable fundamentals such as rising capacity utilization and an expanding economy.&quot; He predicts a 4 1/2%-to-5% increase next year.    Spending began surging in the third quarter -- following six relatively weak quarters -- with outlays climbing 5.9% to a $463.8 billion annual rate, according to the Commerce Department. And equipment salesmen continue to ring up good orders. (It would be surprising if capital spending paced an economic slump since it ordinarily lags a quarter or two behind the business cycle, both when the economy slides into recession and when it starts to recover.)    A major contributor to the brighter investment outlook is the weaker dollar. It is enabling many domestic manufacturers to gain ground against Japanese and European competitors after four years of being mauled, and American executives are becoming confident enough to improve their plant and equipment.    Though the October U.S. trade deficit set a record, many manufacturers discern a basic change in the competitive balance for many products. Mr. Ladehoff, for example, says a decline in imports of iron and brass pipe fittings has stepped up Amcast's orders and its factory operating rates, &quot;giving us encouragement to invest in those facilities.&quot;    The trade gains are contributing to a need for added manufacturing capacity. In November, U.S. factories operated at 82% of capacity, a seven-year high.    Even the ailing steel industry has regained the courage to invest since the dollar's decline has allowed U.S. mills to raise prices. Armco Inc. plans to spend about $400 million to upgrade its steel mills at Ashland, Ky., and Middletown, Ohio, over the next five years. The investment will include $100 million to rebuild a continuous caster at Ashland.    The weaker dollar is also prompting many foreign manufacturers to build or expand facilities in the U.S., and those activities will help propel spending next year. For some, the only way to sell profitably in the U.S. at current exchange rates is to manufacture here.    Though Japanese auto makers have garnered much publicity about their U.S. investments, many other foreign companies are investing heavily as well. For example, Michelin Tire Corp., the U.S. unit of the French Michelin Group, will spend $200 million over the next four years to expand its U.S. tire-making capacity by 30%. The biggest project will be expansion of its Lexington, S.C., plant, but major investments also are planned at factories in Spartanburg and Anderson, S.C., Michelin says.    Capital spending also should be aided next year by manufacturers whose long-term investment plans already call for additional outlays. For instance, 1988 spending at Atlanta-based RJR Nabisco Inc. will exceed this year's projected $1.1 billion because of &quot;an ongoing program to modernize our food facilities that we have been planning for several years.&quot;    The food and tobacco concern has lots of company, says Gordon G. Palmer, who heads Litton Industries Inc.'s Industrial Automation Systems Group. Many companies, he says, delayed plans to modernize for several years after finding that &quot;automation doesn't fix internal problems in strategy, product or management.&quot; Now, Mr. Palmer says, &quot;they've thought through what they must do to be competitive in the world economy, and they're buying the equipment to do it.&quot;    Barring a recession, many companies will have plenty of cash to invest in their plant and equipment. Following a jolt from last year's tax-law changes, corporate cash flow -- after-tax profit plus depreciation -- has resumed its rise. The 1986 tax law eliminated the investment tax credit and included other changes that increased the tax bite on many companies. Dean Witter's Mr. Rippe estimates that cash flow, after removing the effect of changes in prices of goods in inventory, will climb more than 5% next year, following a gain of less than 1% this year and 2.7% in 1986.    Companies can use that cash to reduce costs. Equipment that pays for itself through savings in one to three years is attractive, even during times of economic uncertainty. And, economists say, purchases of computers and other high-technology equipment will account for about one-third of total corporate investment next year, double its share at the start of the decade. Buying much of that equipment are the service, retail, wholesale and communications concerns, which collectively outspend manufacturers these days.    Electronic data-processing equipment purchases continue at a brisk pace, NCR Corp. says. The Dayton, Ohio, company says it expects &quot;double-digit revenue growth&quot; next year, excluding any benefit from changes in currency values.    There are some signs that the market crash has caused some cancellation of spending plans. Telxon Corp., an Akron, Ohio, producer of hand-held computers and other portable electronic data equipment, says a major retailer that had planned to buy $3 million to $4 million of equipment last month opted for an order one-third that size. &quot;He's still giving us a sizable order,&quot; says Raymond D. Meyo, the chief executive officer. And Telxon's sales are still rising, he says, partly because many new customers are seeking equipment that will cut costs.    Some U.S. retail concerns also are curtailing expansion because competition is getting tougher. Wendy's International Inc., the fast-food chain based in Dublin, Ohio, says capital outlays next year won't exceed this year's projected $100 million, which is down from $118 million in 1986.    After opening 112 new restaurants last year, Wendy's is launching fewer than 40 in 1987 and again in 1988. Though &quot;sales have improved since the summer,&quot; a spokesman says, the business climate for fast-food restaurants hasn't rebounded to what it was two years ago.    Ken Goldstein, an economist with the Conference Board, a nonprofit business research concern, is one forecaster who believes mixed economic signals and the market drop will slow spending. He sees 1988 expenditures only matching this year's figures. &quot;A lot of the spending is for office automation and other equipment that can easily be postponed for six months or a year without creating serious problems,&quot; he says. </TEXT></DOC>
