<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-47-1115 </DOCNO><TEXT>A small-size energy-saving high-voltage source power supply with sequentialvoltage stabilization of high-voltage transformer power supply by pulsedand continuous compensation stabilizers is described. Output voltageis smoothly regulated within 1200-3000 V range. The maximum loading currentis 10 mA. Output voltage pulsation amplitude is andless; or equivalent 0.005%, output voltage temperature instability is 0.005 %/deg C, the sourceefficiency is 80 %. Power supply voltage is 27 V +- 40 %.</TEXT></DOC>
