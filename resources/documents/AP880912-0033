SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   What may have been the worst natural disaster ever to strike thenation's Northeast swept in unexpectedly a half-century ago thismonth, a great hurricane that claimed as many as 700 lives by someaccounts.   Born a few days earlier in a tropical depression, the greatstorm roared out of the Atlantic on Sept. 21, 1938, crossed LongIsland leaving a swath of disaster and crashed north into NewEngland.   The storm gave no warning, blasting a region where such weatherfuries are rare and usually fairly weak by the time they arrive.   Coming before the era of satellite observations and rapidelectronic communications, there was none of the advance notice socommon today.   ``It was the worst natural disaster ever to strike thenortheastern United States,'' says weather historian David M.Ludlum in the magazine Weatherwise.   ``The storm snuffed out the lives of some 700 unsuspectingpeople and injured thousands more. It destroyed or badly damaged20,000 homes, summer cottages and farm buildings, as well as 26,000cars and nearly 6,000 boats,'' Ludlum says.   Historians knew of a major New England hurricane in 1815, butsince then the giant tropical storms had generally only brushedthat part of the nation, concentrating their fury on the South.   So neither meteorologists nor residents of the region wereprepared for the speed, direction and intensity of the 1938 storm.   ``Those of us who were in the 1938 hurricane remember how ittook us by surprise. Like the bombing of Pearl Harbor, it wastotally unexpected,'' reported Howard E. Smith Jr. in his book``Killer Weather.''   Like many tropical storms, this hurricane meandered near Floridafor several days before curving to the north, arriving off CapeHatteras, N.C. about 8:30 a.m. on Sept. 21.   Suddenly, it set out on a speedy trip up the coast.   To the north it was a warm, autumn day with no danger in theforecast.   The Weather Bureau in Washington issued a storm warning for theNortheast at 10 a.m., but by then the hurricane was already surgingnorthward.   Broadcast warnings were delayed in some areas because many radiostations were carrying a live speech by German dictator AdolfHitler at the time.   ``By 3:30 p.m. the whole force of the hurricane smashed againstLong Island, New York. The Empire State Building was lost to sightas swirling, silver-sheeted clouds driven by 120 mile per hourwinds engulfed and swayed it to and fro,'' reported Jay Robert Nashin the book ``Darkest Hours.''   Wind gusts would be recorded at 186 miles per hour before thestorm was over. Along the island, beach houses of the rich andfamous collapsed and were swept away.   After blasting clear large expanses of Long Island, the stormsurged across the narrow sound into Connecticut, then headed northto batter Hartford, Springfield and even blast portions of Vermontand upstate New York. Disastrous flooding was reported in centralConnecticut and Massachusetts.   The worst damage was reported along the coasts, though, withstorm-whipped waves estimated at 20 to 30 feet in height. Thewaters of Narragansett Bay were driven into Providence, bringingnormal life to a halt.   Coming at a time of already high tide, the storm wiped out smallbeach resorts in Connecticut and Rhode Island.   ``What I saw that day will stay in my mind forever. Wheneverbefore I had looked at the horizon it had been a straight line. ...Not that day. Gigantic waves moved along the horizon like the teethof some titanic chain saw,'' wrote Smith, who viewed the storm as ayouth in Rockport, Mass.   Along the storm track whole groves of trees were mowed down bythe wind, an estimated 275 million trees being destroyed, accordingto Ludlum. Heavy rains swept the land and power lines were downnearly everywhere.   ``By nightfall on this day of the autumn equinox, eastern LongIsland and practically all of New England with the exception ofMaine lay stunned from the hurricane's blow,'' Ludlum wrote.   His estimate of 700 killed and 1,500 to 2,000 seriously injuredhelps illustrate the confusion generated by the storm, for Nashreports the fatalities at 494, plus 100 missing and never found;while Smith estimates the dead at 680.   Even with the better forecasting that today would give warningof the storm's approach, the potential for disaster remains.   ``If such a storm should hit today, losses could be muchhigher,'' Ludlum warns.   ``There has been a large increase in both summer and year-roundpopulations in these areas, while property values have risenastronomically. This is particularly true along the shore. Andshould a full-fledged hurricane hit during the vacation season,when beaches and roads are packed, the potential for disaster wouldbe appalling.''</TEXT></DOC>
