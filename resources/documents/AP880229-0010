WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Republican Jack Kemp, trying to breathe life intohis lagging presidential campaign, blasted George Bush and Bob Doleas tax-raising twins in a Southern debate and said if either isnominated, ``the Reagan revolution is over, gone, dead.''   And Bush and Dole tangled repeatedly at a debate Sundayafternoon on their differing calls for a budget freeze, on theIran-Contra affair and on protecting the South's textile industryfrom foreign competition.   The GOP debate may be the last confrontation of the four GOPcandidates before the big round of primaries across the South onMarch 8, Super Tuesday.   Bush forces, confident that the vice president commands thefield in Dixie, said after the debate that Bush had no plans toattend the next scheduled debate, set Sunday in Nashville andsponsored by the League of Women Voters. His move could scrap thefinal GOP debate of the Southern campaign.   ``We're simply at a point where we've got 20 states,'' Bushcampaign manager Lee Atwater said. ``We've got a pretty busyschedule.''   Only a week ago, the Bush forces expressed shock that Sen. Doleof Kansas and the fourth contender, Pat Robertson, backed out of asimilar debate in Dallas.   Rep. Kemp of New York, whose White House aspirations are on theropes after a series of poor showings in the earlier primaries andcaucuses, tried to depict himself as the true conservative in therace and lumped Bush and Dole together as moderates who would raisetaxes and turn their backs on the legacy of President Reagan.   ``Frankly under Bob Dole or George Bush you're going to getexactly the same thing,'' Kemp said in the debate sponsored by theAtlanta Journal-Constitution newspapers.   ``They sound alike. They talk alike. And they have supportedtogether every single tax increase in the last eight years.   ``If they're nominated, I want you folks to know, the Reaganrevolution is over, gone, dead,'' he said.   Bush and Dole both objected, saying they have fought against taxincreases and for the Reagan administration's agenda for the pastseven years. They charged that Kemp wasn't willing to take steps tosolve the federal budget deficit, even as both said raising taxeswasn't the way they would do it.   ``Jack's never met a deficit he didn't like,'' Dole said.   Bush told Kemp: ``You don't care about deficits. You never have,and they're public enemy No. 1.''   Dole raised the Iran-Contra subject and, holding a copy of areport by a commission Bush headed that recommended no deals withterrorists, charged that Bush had condoned selling weapons to Iranin exchange for hostages.   ``We should never trade arms for hostages. We shouldn't issuethese reports and say we shouldn't trade arms for hostages _ thevice president's report _ and then later go to a meeting and sayit's all right. We shouldn't do those things,'' Dole said.   Bush, who contends he did not know the arms were being exchangedfor hostages, said only that ``mistakes were made'' in theIran-Contra affair.   Asked later if the affair had occurred on ``his watch,'' Bushreplied: ``I think when the president found out what happened, hetook the proper steps.''   Robertson, the former television preacher, offered a defense ofembattled Attorney General Edwin Meese III, saying intense scrutinyhas made it difficult to attract people to government. Meese isunder investigation by an independent counsel.   After spending the last two weeks explaning his own remarks _that nuclear missiles are in Cuba, that Bush forces have engaged indirty tricks and that his Christian Broadcasting Network knew whereAmerican hostages were held in Lebanon _ Robertson criticized thepress.   ``I know it's very difficult dealing with the press of Americato get the truth out. They love to distort our words,'' Robertsonsaid.   Kemp accused Dole and Robertson of changing positions to pleaseSouthern voters with their support for legislation limiting textileimports. The textile industry is particularly large in SouthCarolina, which holds a key Southern test on Saturday, two daysbefore primaries across the rest of the South.   He referred to Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, a Democraticcandidate who has called for tough trade sanctions against unfairtrading partners, when he said after the debate, ``Pat Robertsonand Bob Dole sound like Dick Gephardt to me on trade.''   Robertson said that foreign imports now make up a large portionof the domestic textile market and asked, ``How much do you want togive them, communist China and communist Russia?''   Bush and Dole attacked each other's proposals for a federalbudget freeze as a way to deal with the deficit. Bush said his wasmore flexible, and that Dole's plan would cut defense spending.   Dole countered that Bush's plan was a ``four-year cop-out.''   The confrontations of the two GOP leaders _ Bush and Dole _ sodominated the first part of the gathering that Kemp protested,``This is a four-man debate.''</TEXT></DOC>
