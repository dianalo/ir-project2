Mohammad Shuaib of the Jamiat-e-Islami rebel group said thousandsof government and Soviet troops were involved and that hundreds ofguerrillas died in the battle before it ended Sunday.   In Moscow, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimovdenied the charge of chemical weapons use, saying neither Soviet norAfghan government forces have such weapons in Afghanistan.   In a state radio broadcast, the Soviet-backed government in Kabulsaid security forces had retaken the Torkham post on theAfghanistan-Pakistan border.   The broadcast, monitored in Islamabad, said 140 guerrillas werekilled and 150 injured at Torkham Monday. Large quantities ofweapons and ammunition were also captured, it said. It gave no otherdetails.   In another development, Afghanistan today requested an emergencymeeting of the U.N. Security Council to stop Pakistan's arming ofanti-government rebels and warned it may be forced to use militaryforce in self-defense. The request was made in a letter from AbdulWakil, Afghanistan's foreign minister.   Western diplomats on Monday confirmed the presence of Sovietsoldiers in the battle for the Torkham post and the highway linkingJalalabad in eastern Afghanistan to Pakistan.   Diplomats said Soviet soldiers were flown in to join theoffensive, presumably from Kabul, the Afghan capital about 70 milesto the west. They and most guerrilla informants spoke on conditionof anonymity.   Insurgents who reached Peshawar, about 30 miles inside Pakistan,claimed Soviet and Afghan forces used chemical weapons. They saidexplosive shells fired by artillery contained a chemical that causedvictims to blister and vomit blood.   Moslem rebels began fighting after a Communist coup in April 1978and the Soviet Union sent military forces into Afghanistan inDecember 1979. In April, the Soviets accepted a U.N.-mediatedagreement to withdraw their about 100,000 troops.   About half the force has gone home, but the Soviets said lastweek they were suspending the withdrawal and sending new weaponsinto Afghanistan because of continuing guerrilla attacks. Theyadded, however, that they still intend to complete the pullout asscheduled on Feb. 15.   The U.S.-backed guerrillas captured Torkham Nov. 2 and hadclaimed they were closing in on Jalalabad.   Both diplomats and rebels said Soviet commandos supported byhelicopter gunships moved out of Jalalabad on foot, moving along theroad to Torkham, according to insurgent sources.   The official Afghan radio said high military officials visitedthe post Monday.   Insurgents and diplomats said the guerrillas retreated intoPakistan, where about 3 million Afghan refugees live.   Earlier this month, the government displayed SS-1 Scud missilesin Kabul. Advanced MiG-27 ground-attack jets and sophisticatedhelicopter gunships have been reported in action against theguerrillas.   Arrival of the new weapons prompted a guerrilla offensive alongthe strategic Salang highway that links Kabul with the Soviet borderto the north.   Ahmad Shah Masoud, Jamiat-e-Islami's commander in the PanjshirValley, claims to have closed the highway but Shuaib of the Jamiatsaid reports from units along the road were sporadic and there wasno recent confirmation that it remained closed.   The Salang highway is the only overland route to the Soviet Union.</TEXT></DOC>
