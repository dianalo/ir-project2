The ratings concern lowered Southmark's senior debt to single-B from double-B-plus; its subordinated debt to triple-C-plus from double-B-minus and its preferred stock to triple-C from single-B-plus. Southmark is a Dallas-based real estate concern.    Among the three Southmark units, NACO Finance Corp.'s senior debt rating was lowered to single-B from double-B-plus; Southmark California Inc.'s subordinated debt rating was lowered to triple-C-plus from double-B-minus; and Southmark San Juan Inc.'s guaranteed industrial revenue bonds were lowered to single-B from double-B-plus.    Sandamp;P said Southmark's ability to realize value through rapid turnover of real-estate assets has been hurt by the real-estate slump and by tax revision. Additionally, Sandamp;P said Southmark's financial flexibility has been impaired by its high debt level, reduced earnings and cash flow, and its decision to omit common stock dividends.    Southmark declined to comment.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Southmark closed at $2.875, down 37.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
