It doesn't make any sense, but it's wonderful,''George said.   He said that at first, he didn't think the whales could be freed.   ``No, I thought it was one of those exercises in futility thatyou had to do,'' he said. ``I learned a lot. I learned that withpersistence, clear thinking and proper chain saws, you can doanything.''   His colleague, Geoff Carroll, who shared the vigil for nightafter cold, lonely night, said he was more optimistic from thebeginning.   ``It was just one of those things where you start out, and seewhat happens. I guess I always believed we'd get them out, but Inever thought it would turn out the way it did.''   Whaling captain Arnold Brower also spent countless hours on theice, offering his expertise and mobilizing the Eskimos who kept thewhales alive and moving toward safety by cutting a path of more than100 breathing holes.   ``I'm really relieved,'' he said. ``I feel like my burden may belifted.''   Rescue coordinator Ron Morris said he never had any doubts aboutthe eventual success of the operation, which ended with the whalesfollowing the path cut by a Soviet icebreaker.   Rick Skluzacek and Greg Ferrian, Minnesotans who showed upuninvited to provide de-icing equipment that enabled rescuers tokeep the breathing holes open, were elated.   ``Great,'' Skluzacek said of the whales' escape. ``Anything morethan that one-word answer is too much. You can't describe thefeeling.   ``I couldn't feel better now, no way, shape or how,'' he said ashe went off to look for a cigar to celebrate.   ``It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience,'' said Ferrian,Skuzacek's brother-in-law. ``But if anybody asked me to do it again,I'd say no.''   The environmental group Greenpeace hailed the spirit ofcooperation that characterized the rescue.   ``These whales showed us the way toward global consciousness andtrue international cooperation,'' Campbell Plowden, the group'swhale campaign coordinator, said in a statement released inWashington, D.C. ``If this much attention would only be paid to theplight of the hundreds of whales harpooned each year by Japan,Iceland and Norway, the whales could truly be saved.''   President Reagan praised the rescue in a statement from the WhiteHouse. ``The human persistence and determination by so manyindividuals on behalf of these whales shows mankind's concern forthe environment,'' he said. ``It has been an inspiring endeavor.''   The Soviet news agency Tass noted those comments in its report onthe story today.</TEXT></DOC>
