Lamar Alexander as education secretary,choosing a teachers' son with a reputation as an education reformerto take over a department recently troubled by controversy.   Bush made no mention of last week's abrupt departure of hisfirst education secretary, Lauro Cavazos, who was forced to resignby the White House. Praise for the choice of Alexander, currentlypresident of the University of Tennessee, was quick and widespread,suggesting there would be no lingering ill effects from the firingof Cavazos.   Meanwhile, sources said the administration had decided toreverse a ruling by the Education Department's Office of CivilRights that colleges could not award scholarships on the basis ofrace alone.   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush was ``verydisturbed'' by a department official's ruling last week that suchscholarships are illegal.   Bush ``believes these scholarships are important to minoritiesand to ensuring opportunities for all Americans to get a goodeducation,'' and has ordered the department to conduct a quickreview, with advice from the Justice Department and White Houselawyers, Fitzwater said.   Alexander refused to be drawn into the controversy, saying inanswer to questions that he had ``many many opinions about it'' andwould be willing to ``be full of advice to the president'' and theSenate.   ``My general disposition would be that when you're wanderingthrough constitutional thickets, that a warm heart and a littlecommon sense sometimes are helpful,'' he said, noting that theUniversity of Tennessee offers scholarships to poor, minoritystudents.   The president, announcing his choice of Alexander, said, ``Nogovernor in the country is so clearly identified with theimperative to improve education in America.''   ``Lamar, if you'll remember, was at the forefront of themovement to restructue our nation's schools,'' Bush said. ``Whenhe was chairman of the National Governors' Association he wasinstrumental in bringing education reform to the very top of theagenda.   Alexander, 50, left the Tennessee governor's office in 1986after two terms and moved to Australia for six months. In 1988, hewas appointed to his university post.   He said his goals, in addition to improving schools for thenation's children, will include creating better training and adulteducation opportunities for American workers who need new skillsfor the changing workplace.   Alexander said that when Tennessee was looking for workers for anew General Motors plant, families considering the move had twoconcerns:   ``The second question is, `Where can I get good schools for mychildren?' and the first question is, `Where can I go back toschool?''' he said.   While governor, Alexander unveiled an education reform packagecalled Better Schools that included adding a career ladder of payraises for teachers and principals, expanding basic educationcurriculum, putting computers in junior high schools and hiringmore math and science teachers.   In early reaction to the choice:   - Richard F. Rosser, president of the National Association ofIndependent Colleges and Universities, called Alexander ``one ofthe best people in the country'' in terms of background andunderstanding of education. Rosser added, ``He also is known as athoughtful, moderate Republican ... and clearly we need someone whois going to be in the mainstream in terms of their thinking of whatneeds to be done in education.''   - Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation ofTeachers, said he was optimistic that Alexander could bring to thedepartment some of the dynamism that critics said it lacked underCavazos. He said he hoped Alexander would not be as zealous asothers in the Bush administration in pushing the concept of publicschool choice as the key to school reform.   - Ernest Boyer, head of The Carnegie Foundation for theAdvancement of Teaching, said, ``Every signal suggests that notonly does he have strong commitment but a realistic sense of whatthe priorities should be. It seems to me that he's looked at reformmore broadly. There is nothing in his past record to suggest thathe's be narrow or ideological.''   Bush's choice of Alexander, three days after picking Rep. LynnMartin of Illinois as labor secretary, fills his Cabinet for now -although there is much talk that at least one more member may leavesoon, perhaps to take the vacant position of chairman of theRepublican National Committee.   The nominations will be considered by the Senate Labor and HumanResources Committee. The panel's chairman, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,D-Mass., said Monday that Alexander ``has a distinguished record ineducation and earned bipartisan respect for his role in stimulatingeducation reform in the states.''   Alexander told Bush Monday that his parents were teachers andthat as governor ``I discovered that our state's major need wasbetter schools, colleges and universities.''   He received a law degree at New York University and latersupplemented his income as a law clerk in New Orleans by playingthe trombone in a Dixieland band at night.</TEXT></DOC>
