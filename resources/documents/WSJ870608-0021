The laser process was developed in Piscataway, N.J., by researchers with Bell Communications Research Inc., or Bellcore, a joint venture for research formed by the regional Bell operating companies, and by scientists at Rutgers University. Other researchers, including a group at International Business Machines Corp., already have made thin films of the materials with different techniques. Such films are needed for producing complex integrated circuits.    The new superconductors carry electricity without resistance at low temperatures, promising revolutionary electrical devices, including electronic components that are smaller and faster than those now used. Developed during the past year, they work at warmer, more cheaply attained temperatures than previously known superconductors, which had to be cooled with expensive liquid helium.    Bellcore said the new method for making thin films employs rapid laser pulses to vaporize small amounts of a superconducting material. The vapors are deposited as a thin layer on a foundation substance that is then baked at high temperature.    Bellcore said the resulting film showed zero electrical resistance at 83 degrees Kelvin, or about 310 degrees below zero Fahrenheit. That means that inexpensive liquid nitrogen, which exists at about 320 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, could be used to induce the film's superconductivity. Other scientists recently have developed materials that show superconductivity at higher temperatures but haven't reported making thin films with them.    Scientists said Bellcore's technique adds a promising possibility for making thin films with the new superconductors. &quot;No one knows yet which method will be the most reliable and economic,&quot; said Theodore Geballe, a physicist at Stanford University. &quot;But it's very nice that we have different options.&quot; He added that he and other scientists have used electron beams rather than lasers to vaporize the new superconducting material when making thin films.    Bellcore doesn't plan to seek a patent for the method because it was previously developed for use with other materials, said John Rowell, a Bellcore research manager. He added that Bellcore plans to publish details of the technique in Applied Physics Letters, a scientific journal. </TEXT></DOC>
