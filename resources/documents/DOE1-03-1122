The analysisdescribes the conditions that would be encountered at the forward stagnationpoint of a liquid droplet that is injected into a gaseous environmentthat is at a temperature that is well above, and at a pressure that isslightly below (near-critical), or well above (supercritical), thosecorresponding to the critical values of the liquid. The initial dropletinjection process is modeled by suddenly imposing a strain stagnationgas flow on the still liquid surface. In the analysis the transient,axisymmetric, stream function-vorticity equation, and the conservationequations of energy and species for both liquid and gas phases are solvedsimultaneously to determine the profiles of the vorticity, energy andspecies distributions and the regression rate of the interface. Two differentsolution methods are used to calculate this unsteady boundary-value problemwith a moving interface. These are: an expansion of the solution in apower series in time after the sudden initiation of the liquid heatingprocess; and a fully numerical integration of the governing equations.</TEXT></DOC>
