Furthermore, President Bush, despite the move against importsannounced Tuesday, still does not support a ban on the weaponsthemselves, his press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, said.   Fitzwater was asked by reporters if the president would expandthe review of the uses of the weapons to domestic models.   ``There are no plans of that kind anticipated,'' he said.   ``Right now we don't see any need for any review or any otherchanges at all.'' He said the problem of imports was highlighted indiscussions between Bush's new drug policy coordinator, WilliamBennett, and Stephen Higgins, director of the Bureau of AlcoholTobacco and Firearms.   ``It did prompt a review of them. ... At this point we are notwilling to extend that,'' Fitzwater said.   Several domestic models perform the same functions and have thesame characteristics as the imported models affected by Tuesday'ssuspension. One U.S. manufacturer, Colt Industries, on Wednesdayannounced a voluntary suspension of sales of its AR15, a civilianversion of the military's .223-caliber M-16.   The weapons have prompted growing public concern, especially withregard to their proliferation and use in drug-related streetviolence.   The California State Legislature has acted to ban a wide range ofsemiautomatic weapons in the wake of a schoolyard shooting spree inJanuary in which Patrick Edward Purdy killed five Stockton childrenwith a Chinese-made AK-47. He then killed himself.   The administration's suspension of imports, pending a review oftheir uses in the United States, will affect some 110,000 weapons,Bennett said, including AKS-type firearms such as AK-47s, Uzicarbines, FN-FAL and FN-FNC-type weapons and Steyr Aug semiautomaticweapons.   Fitzwater stopped short of completely ruling out action on thedomestically produced weapons.   ``We're not going through and changing everything that's notwarranted. We're just saying here's an issue that's come to light.We need to deal with this and then we'll see where we go,'' he said.   While the move against imports is seen as a softening of Bush'slongstanding opposition to gun controls, and a potential sore spotwith his fellow National Rifle Association members, Fitzwatercontended Bush was not making a new policy.   The administration suspended the imports using existing law thatallows import of the semiautomatics only if they are for sportinguse.   The next step is to find out if they are being used in other ways.   Fitzwater sidestepped numerous questions about why the use ofimports needs to be reviewed when domestic weapons are not reviewed.   While saying there has been no change in Bush's position,Fitzwater also expanded the president's position beyond what Bushtold reporters when the question first arose last month.   Bush had said at that time he would ``strongly oppose'' a ban onsemiautomatics. In subsequent remarks he said he was concerned aboutthe problem and had asked Bennett to come up with suggestions todeal with it and still ``do what's right'' by the sportsman.   Fitzwater said Wednesday that the president's original positionwas that ``he does not favor banning the wepaons that are used bysportsmen and are in compliance with the law.''   ``He has said initially that he did not belive in banning theseguns until we looked into it. He was concerned about the problem.''   Vice President Dan Quayle told The Associated Press he receivedseveral ``inquiries'' from people concerned about the administrationaction.   He declined to elaborate, but said Bush ``was absolutely right toenforce the existing regulations we have. ... I see it as a seriousattempt by President Bush to review the situation.''</TEXT></DOC>
