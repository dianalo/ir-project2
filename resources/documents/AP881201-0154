Boksburg, east of Johannesburg, was the first to resegregateparks and other amenities since the Conservative Party won controlof dozens of municipalities in elections Oct. 26. Several othertowns now want to bar blacks from facilities opened to all races inrecent years.   Blacks, who outnumber Boksburg whites by nearly 2-1, plan asit-in Friday at Boksburg Lake, a 37-acre park the City Council lastweek reserved for whites.   ``It will be a white Christmas without the snow,'' BuchananJantjes, head of the management committee in Boksburg's mixed-raceReiger Park township, said when he announced a black boycott ofwhite-owned businesses.   Conservative Party spokesman Clive Derby-Lewis said the party``is simply applying the laws which exist ... The whites generatethis country's economy and the so-called black spending power isnothing more than the by-product of the white economy.''   About 300 Boksburg whites and a few blacks packed into a churchhall Thursday night to plan a campaign against the council. Businessand civic leaders distributed petitions denouncing resegregation andseeking a referendum.   Several businessmen have signs in their windows that say ``AllRaces Welcome.'' The Boksburg council said blacks are welcome toshop _ they just cannot own businesses there.   Major department stores announced they will not build whererenewed segregation threatens business, and 27 businesses signed apetition urging the council to retract.   The giant clothing chain Edgars Stores said it has withdrawn fromnegotiations to build a new store in Boksburg because of the city'squestionable economic future.   ``The fact that the questionable future in this instance isdirectly a consequence of a bad policy decision needs to becommunicated very strongly,''said Fred Haupt, Edgars group generalmanager.   Boksburg Mayor Beyers de Klerk retaliated, ``I'm here to fight tosurvive and I expect all the thunderbolts in hell to rain down onme.''   Cricket, golf, hockey and cycling federations said they willcancel tours, prohibit tournaments and withdraw subsidies andcoaching from towns that resegregate.   It is illegal under South Africa's 29-month state of emergency tocall for boycotts or economic sanctions. But the government has madeno attempt to stop such measures being used against Boksburg.   The National Party, which has governed for 40 years, introducedthe major apartheid legislation and segregates some facilities incities it controls.   Yet government officials have joined the chorus of condemnation.They say reimposing stricter apartheid will trigger a black backlashand give the country a bad name at a time when peace negotiationsand reprieves for condemned black prisoners have boosted thegovernment's international image.   Constitutional Development Minister Chris Heunis defendedapartheid laws Thursday, but said the government would stop theConservatives. ``It will not be tolerated that we move backwards,''he said.   President P. W. Botha reaffirmed his government's commitment to``the maintenance of own communities for every population group.''</TEXT></DOC>
