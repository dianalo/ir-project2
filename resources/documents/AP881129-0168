Since 1934, federal regulations have required corporate officersand directors to disclose publicly whenever they buy or sell stockin their own company. The commission, by a 3-0 vote, invited publiccomment for 90 days on what would be the first major change to therules since they were established to prevent ``insiders'' fromgaining advantage from information not available to all stockholders.   Corporate officers are supposed to report to the SEC within 10days of acquiring insider status. They must file subsequent reportsin the first 10 days of the month after they buy or sell stock.   According to a survey by the SEC staff, 43 percent of the reportshave been filed late so far this year. An unknown number of insidersnever filed at all.   Under the proposal, companies would be required to list violatorsin their annual reports and proxy statements.   Insiders also would be required to report trades inexchange-listed options as well as stocks.   A new and narrower definition of insider is being proposed toinclude only chief executives and other policy-making officers.   And the commmission is asking for public comment on whether itshould seek authorization from Congress to impose fines againstviolators. Currently, its only option is to seek a court orderforcing compliance.</TEXT></DOC>
