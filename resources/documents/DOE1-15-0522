This involves consideration ofprogram structure, processor and memory resource allocation, and connectiontopology to obtain optimal system balance and efficiency. This paperpresents an overview of a new parallel programming language Multi-Pascalwhich supports a variety of mechanisms for dynamic creation of parallelprocesses which communicate through shared memory or communication channels.To optimize algorithms for specific target multiprocessor architectures,the language has features that allow the programmer to control some aspectsof processor and memory allocation. A complete interpreter and simulationsystem for Multi-Pascal has been developed to determine the expectedspeedup of programs for various classes of multiprocessor architectures.</TEXT></DOC>
