Mr. Bush made clear that the sluggish economy was toppriority for his new team, as he looks to Mr. Skinner to helpassemble new economic-stimulus proposals and to the campaignorganization to counter attacks from Democrats andRepublicans alike that he lacks a domestic agenda.</LP><TEXT>   Among the appointments, which were expected, the presidentdesignated Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher as generalcampaign chairman, pollster Robert Teeter as chief strategistand head of day-to-day operations, and business executiveFred Malek as the campaign's administrative manager.   Mr. Bush suggested once again that his problems werelargely a matter of public relations, complaining about&quot;gloom and doom . . . every single night&quot; in news reports anda one-sided political environment in which rival candidatescriticize him with &quot;nobody out there shooting back.&quot; WhileMr. Bush didn't disclose any marching orders for Mr. Skinner,initial speculation centered on improvements in theoften-criticized White House communications team.   Some administration officials insist that the president'sproblems are more substantive, however, because he stillhasn't clearly decided among the conflicting courses ofactions advocated by aides in the administration.   Despite Mr. Skinner's reputation as a political moderate,conservative advocates of a more aggressive tax-cuttingprogram take some hope from his appointment. Mr. Sununu hadsided with White House economic advisers Michael Boskin andRichard Darman, who have argued against large tax cuts thatmight upset the deficit-reduction agreement with Congress.   Mr. Skinner, 53 years old, is to take over as chief ofstaff when Mr. Sununu leaves Dec. 15, and will spend the nextfew days consulting with the former New Hampshire governorand several former chiefs of staff. One of them, HowardBaker, former Senate Majority Leader and Reagan White HouseChief of Staff, said in an interview that Mr. Skinner's firsttask should be fashioning &quot;a unifying theme&quot; for thepresident's approach to the economy. So far, Mr. Bush's maineconomic theme has been a political gold mine for theDemocrats: a capital gains tax cut that the administrationcontends will produce economic growth but which will providethe greatest direct benefits to wealthy Americans.   At a minimum, Mr. Skinner must help Mr. Bush's White Houserecover its political footing after weeks of bumbling andflip-flops for which the combative Mr. Sununu received muchof the blame. Mr. Sununu, who resigned under pressureTuesday, stood alongside Mr. Skinner at the White House newsconference where President Bush announced the appointments.   Mr. Skinner has displayed considerable political acumen,as well as relentless drive and ambition, in a 23-year publiccareer boosted by his longtime benefactor, former IllinoisGov. James Thompson. His ties with Mr. Bush go back to the1980 presidential campaign.   The one-time International Business Machines Corp.salesman made his public reputation as a U.S. attorneyprosecuting Chicago officials on corruption charges, earningthe nickname &quot;Sam the Hammer.&quot; He used a softer touch astransportation secretary to forge good relationships withinthe admininstration, particularly with Vice President DanQuayle, a golfing pal, and treated congressmen like personalconstituents, answering phone calls promptly and makingfrequent trips to Capitol Hill.   &quot;One of his strengths is that he can disagree withoutbeing disagreeable,&quot; says Galen Reser, who headed Mr.Skinner's government-affairs office before recently leavingfor a job at PepsiCo Inc.   Mr. Skinner has also won praise as a skillful manager whodoused a bitter feud between the department and itsindependent-minded Federal Aviation Administration and whomanaged to drum up national interest in such dry issues asinfrastructure. During his tenure, he oversaw the developmentof a national transportation policy and helped negotiatemajor aviation and surface-transportation legislation.   But he has drawn criticism, too. Mr. Skinner took officepromising to try to promote airline competition, only topreside over the biggest consolidation in the industry'shistory. This year alone, three airlines have closed down.Though he took some modest steps to preserve competition,some critics say they weren't enough.   &quot;He missed a lot of opportunities because he wanted toavoid getting egg on his face,&quot; said Michael E. Levine, deanof Yale University's management school.   In any case, the airlines' problems haven't hurt Mr.Skinner politically. Indeed, perhaps in a measure of hispolitical skill, critics of Mr. Skinner often blamed theOffice of Management and Budget rather than him fordisappointing policies.   Another of Mr. Skinner's advantages is his longstandingrelationship with Mr. Teeter, which should smooth dealingsbetween the White House and the campaign organization. Mr.Sununu had such poor relations with Mr. Teeter and othercampaign officials that some had expressed reluctance to jointhe president's re-election bid so long as Mr. Teeter was inthe job.   Even before he took office as secretary, he managed toelude political minefields. Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio)initially blocked his nomination, charging that as aprosecutor he hadn't vigorously pursued allegations that drugmaker G.D. Searle Co. had concealed test results. Mr. Skinnerlater joined Sidley andamp; Austin, the firm that defended Searlein the case in question. But the Senate Commerce Committeecleared Mr. Skinner of wrongdoing and Sen. Metzenbaumconcluded that he was a &quot;man of integrity.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
