Process methods, potentialor known exposure conditions, and test sampling methods were assessedto determine if a comprehensive investigation was needed to evaluatelong-term health effects associated with wood preserving. Fifteen of27 employees at the facility treat utility poles with pentachlorophenol(PCP) using a nonpressure thermal process. Employee training and workpractices, the occupational educational program, historical data, andresults of safety and health monitoring were evaluated. General air samplingwas conducted during regular operations at sites of potential exposurein order to evaluate different air-sampling methods, define analyticallimitations, and obtain a range of exposure levels during critical shortterm tasks. PCP concentrations were measured 0.13 to 0.36 milligramsper cubic meter (mg/cu m) using a NIOSH procedure, and 0.27 to 1.33 mg/cum using a silica-gel method. The authors conclude that differences inresults using the NIOSH procedure and the silica-gel method could notbe explained adequately because of the limited data obtained.</TEXT></DOC>
