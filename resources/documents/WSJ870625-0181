The recommendation of an FDA advisory committee concerning TPA has not thrown &quot;U.S. medical research into a major crisis,&quot; nor does the episode suggest that the drug review process is &quot;significantly flawed.&quot;    On May 29 the FDA's Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee reviewed the data on two drugs proposed for dissolving blood clots in the coronary arteries, streptokinase and TPA. The committee recommended unanimously that the FDA approve streptokinase but, by a vote of 10 to 1, that the agency require additional data on TPA. We have no position on the committee's recommendation. It is a complex health decision for the FDA to make in consultation with its medical and scientific experts.    We do take exception, however, to your editorial's comments on the situation. The committee's recommendation is not cause for an ad hominem attack on Dr. Robert Temple, one of the FDA's leading physician-scientists. Dr. Temple is not responsible for the opinion of an outside advisory committee, nor will the decision on TPA be made by the office he heads.    We are also concerned about your strident rejection of the committee's views. We believe it important for the FDA to seek the advice of experts on complex scientific decisions. The members of this particular committee are leaders in cardiology and medical science from such wellknown medical schools as Cornell, Harvard, Columbia, Mt. Sinai of New York and Baylor. It is unwise to immediately characterize the committee's interest in statistically valid data as &quot;pedantry&quot; and its recommendations as &quot;absurd.&quot;    Controversial recommendations from advisory committees are an inevitable outcome of open government and of the scientific peer review process at work. They are not cause for alarm, nor do they require FDA Commissioner Frank Young or Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Otis Bowen to &quot;fix the FDA.&quot;    What Dr. Young and his staff need at this point is a little time out of the glare of publicity to review carefully the committee's recommendations, to consider the scientific evidence on TPA, and then to act. Handling controversial issues is standard bread-and-butter work at the FDA. We are confident that the FDA can reach a thoughtful decision on TPA that is sensitive to the public health, providing the agency stays focused on the medical and scientific issues in the case.    J.

Since clinical tests show TPA dissolves blood clots and opens clogged arteries at twice the rate of a competing drug, streptokinase, it is both important and appropriate to question the actions of the FDA panel in this matter.    The Industrial Biotechnology Association has a special interest in doing so, first because TPA is a biotechnology product, and second because a number of other similar products are in various stages of review. We want to be sure we know what the rules are.    The specific question the majority of the advisory committee seems to be dissatisfied with is whether the use of TPA actually prolongs the life of those who suffer a heart attack. A subsidiary question of whether the drug improves the left ventricular function seems to have been answered in the affirmative by a Johns Hopkins study, although this data was not officially before the committee on May 29.    Here then is the problem. Streptokinase has been found to improve survival. Since TPA performs the same clot-dissolving function as that drug, and does so more efficiently, logic seems to compel the conclusion that TPA improves survival as well. However, the committee panelists labeled that argument &quot;intuition, not proof.&quot;    The point of all this is that improvements in procedure at the FDA can very likely result in getting very badly needed new drugs and biologics to patients in serious and life-threatening situations. The American public has a right to access and early application of the health-related benefits from biotechnology. And both the economic benefits and enhancement of the U.S. competitive position, which will result from a more speedy approval process, deserve consideration as well.    Richard D.
