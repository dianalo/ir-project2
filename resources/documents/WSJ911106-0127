One popularordeal, called ordeal by water, involved binding the accusedand throwing him in a pond. If the accused sank, he wasinnocent; if he floated he was guilty. Ordeal by water wasvery much a no-win proposition: You were guilty and alive orinnocent and dead. Very much like what Clarence Thomasexperienced. In many respects, however, it was more fair.Perhaps we ought to consider switching to something likethis. At least we would not have a lot of innocent survivorsaround to remind us of what we have done.   What can be done about this? Probably very little. Theonly hope is for the American public to rise up and showtheir disgust with the process and bring about an end toimmunized character assassinations. However, while we areholding our breath for this to happen. I have the followingadditional and equally improbable suggestions:</LP><TEXT>   1. The president's investigation of the candidate, throughthe FBI, should not be shared at all with the Senate. AsAttorney General, and later Justice, Robert Jackson said:   &quot;Disclosure of information contained in the reports{would} be the grossest kind of injustice to innocentindividuals. Investigative reports include leads andsuspicions, and sometimes even the statements of malicious ormisinformed people. Even though later and more completereports exonerate the individuals, the use of particular orselected reports might constitute the grossest injustice, andwe all know that a correction never catches up with anaccusation.&quot;   These reports constitute the president's investigation ofthe president's nominee and in the past were not generallyshared with the Senate. Since the practice of sharing reportsbegan, it has been systematically abused to inflict graveinjury on innocent persons. Nor would a return to the priormodel justify the Senate establishing its own FBI. Thenecessary and proper clause cannot be stretched that far.   2. As the president suggested last week, the time betweennomination and confirmation should be shortened materially.Even six weeks is too long, particularly where the nomineehas been confirmed by the Senate once, twice or three timesbefore, as in the cases of William Bradford Reynolds, RobertBork and Clarence Thomas. Perhaps the rule should be that anappointment is confirmed without a vote if a candidate is notrejected within a certain period. Sort of a reverse pocketveto.   3. The president should not let up on the Congress untilit adopts laws that protect privacy and enable criminal lawpunishment of leaks. (Not informal rules or standards to beenforced by the Senate or House Ethics committees -- whichhave never inflicted serious punishment and never will.) Thenotion that this would violate separation of powers isnonsense. Congress has passed laws requiring the executive toprosecute executive branch officials who violate theprerogatives of Congress. It can certainly allow those samelaws to be enforced against its own employees and members.   4. Nominees should be advised that personal and privatesubjects are off limits and that they are entitled to declineto discuss such matters absent a clear, specific and credibleclaim that they have violated some law. And they should alsocontinue to refrain from discussing how they would rule incases that might come before them.   5. The American Bar Association and all other self-servinginterest groups should be deleted from the process. Whatmakes the ABA particularly qualified to judge Supreme Courtcandidates? And who elects the judicial evaluation committee?   6. I hope that the president will not be reluctant tocontinue to nominate strong, principled and experiencedindividuals. Robert Bork, in a losing cause, and ClarenceThomas, in a more successful one, showed that a great dealcan be gained by letting intelligent, articulateconservatives appear on television before the Americanpeople. The messages they have to convey are potent andpersuasive and the president should take advantage of theopportunity these hearings present. For one, I flatly rejectthe notion that the president should nominate so-called&quot;centrists&quot; or even liberals, as Stuart Taylor advocates inthe American Lawyer. The debate that will ensue when thepresident nominates another Robert Bork or Antonin Scalia isa splendid opportunity because the more their ideas are heardwithout the filter of an unsympathetic press, the more theirideas will be understood and accepted.   7. Serious consideration should be given to greaterexecutive branch oversight of the legislature. Is itconstitutional to have 107 committees and subcommitteesexercising oversight over the Defense Department, but noexecutive branch oversight over Congress? While such aconcept is an anathema to Congress, a discussion of thissubject might lead to greater attention to the abuses oflegislative oversight over the executive.   In the long run, very little will be done unless thepublic begins to appreciate what has been done to corrupt andmanipulate the process in ways we are beginning to accept asa normal part of the system. Congress is discouragingqualified and experienced people from seeking public officeand it is diminishing the authority of those who survive theprocess and assume positions of leadership. &quot;Every nation hasthe government it deserves,&quot; Joseph de Maistre observednearly 200 years ago. If we want a strong and effectivegovernment, we must stop trying to destroy our most able andwilling leaders. And we must not give in to those who loseelections, but who wish nonetheless to exercise the authorityof office.   ---   Mr. Olson is a former assistant attorney general underPresident Reagan.
