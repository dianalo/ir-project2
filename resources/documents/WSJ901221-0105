The U.S. currency gained as international investors soughtsafety in the face of probable political turmoil. At onepoint, the dollar was up 2.5% on the day against the mark,and it remained nearly that high late in the New York tradingsession. The rush to dollars was triggered by the suddenresignation of Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, amove that called into question the stability of the SovietUnion.</LP><TEXT>   European financial markets were shaken by the news. TheGerman stock market plummeted 3.3%. Prices of German 10-yeargovernment bonds, or bunds, fell nearly 1%. Italian stockswere off 3%, Norway's market lost 2.8%, and both the Frenchand Austrian stock markets were down 2.3%. The London stockmarket, Europe's largest and most liquid, fared better thanmost others. It was off slightly less than 1%.   U.S. financial markets tended to shrug off the SovietUnion's problems. Treasury bond prices were off for the day,but the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 2.73 points toclose at 2629.46 in active trading.   Some analysts suggested that the lingering Persian Gulfcrisis is taking a back seat, at least in European investors'minds, to the Soviet Union's internal problems.   &quot;The Soviet risk is the real political risk,&quot; said AnneParker Mills, a currency strategist at Shearson LehmanBrothers Inc.   Yesterday's rush to the dollar went a long way towardrestoring the U.S. currency's tarnished reputation as ahaven. The dollar's failure to gain significantly afterIraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait led many analysts toquestion that traditional role for the currency. But itssharp rise yesterday, coupled with drops in both the Swissfranc and gold, indicated that the dollar still commands therespect of international investors despite a weak U.S.economy and falling U.S. interest rates. If the SovietUnion's political situation deteriorates further, analystspredict, the dollar will continue to climb.   &quot;At some point,&quot; Ms. Mills said, &quot;the European investorwill say, `I don't care whether I get a lower rate of returnon dollar assets, and I don't care if the U.S. is in arecession. I want to increase my holdings in the U.S. becausethe dollar is the only real safe haven currency.' That movemay have begun in earnest.&quot;   Mr. Shevardnadze's resignation is important because of hisclose association with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev andwith Mr. Gorbachev's program to liberalize the Soviet Unioninternally and conduct a more accommodating foreign policy.Mr. Shevardnadze also is well known and respected outside theSoviet Union. Analysts said his resignation raises thepossibility of two dangerous scenarios: either a return to ahard-line dictatorship in Moscow or the ultimate breakup ofthe Soviet Union.   Turmoil in the Soviet Union has a direct and pronouncedeffect on European markets, particularly Germany's, becauseof Germany's proximity to Eastern Europe and the fact thatGermany is Moscow's largest trading partner in the West.   &quot;Germany was the market that benefited the most&quot; from thepolitical and economic changes in Eastern Europe, said StevenKeddell, a first vice president at Deutsche Bank CapitalCorp. in New York. Therefore, German markets stand to suffermost from a reversal of those changes, he said.   In major market action:                                                                                                          U.S. stock prices were mixed. Volume on the New York StockExchange totaled 174.7 million shares. Declining issues onthe Big Board were ahead of gainers, 813726.                                                                                                          Bond prices fell. The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bondlost 5/8 of a point, or $6.25 for each $1,000 face amount.The yield on the issue rose to 8.23%.                                                                                                          The dollar rose sharply. In late New York trading, thecurrency was quoted at 1.5115 marks and 135.85 yen, comparedwith 1.4785 marks and 134.05 yen late Wednesday.</TEXT></DOC>
