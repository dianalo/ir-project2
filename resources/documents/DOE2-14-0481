To improve patient care, theradiologist has sought the finest quality radiographic film for use withthe best radiographic imaging systems. The proper choice and use of x-raytubes, generators, film-screen combinations, and contrast media has occupiedthe professional attention of the radiologist since the inception ofradiology. Image quality can be significantly improved with digitallyformatted diagnostic imaging systems by providing dynamic ranges in excessof those possible with analog x-ray films. In a CT scanner, the digitalacquisition and reconstruction system can obtain a dynamic range (contrastresolution) of 10,000 to 1. Digital subtraction angiography systems achieve10-bit dynamic ranges for each of the acquired television frames. Increasesin the dynamic ranges of the various imaging modalities have been coupledwith improved spatial resolution. A digitally formatted image is a two-dimensional,numerical array of discrete image elements. Each picture element is calleda pixel. Each pixel has a discrete size. Figure 15.1 illustrates a digitallyformatted image depicting the spatial resolution, array size, and quantizationor numerical range of the pixel values. Currently, 512 x 512 image arraysare standard. Development of 1024 x 1024 digital arrays are underway.Significant improvements have also been achieved in the rates at whichdigital diagnostic imaging data can be acquired, manipulated, and archived.</TEXT></DOC>
