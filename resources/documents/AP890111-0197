(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Singer-author Barry Sadler, who wrote the``Ballad of the Green Berets,'' left a hospital where he was beingtreated for brain damage and is believed to be staying with friends,a lawyer said Wednesday.   Sadler's wife, Lavona Ruth Sadler, and mother claim he isincompetent and should be placed under guardianship. His 24-year-oldson on Tuesday was named temporary guardian.   Sadler, 48, was shot in the head during a robbery attempt at hishome in Guatemala City in September and lost 30 percent of hisbrain, said Hal Hardin, an attorney for Sadler's wife.   ``Sometimes he's lucid, sometimes he's not. Sometimes he'sconversant, sometimes he's not,'' Hardin said, adding that Sadler ispartly paralyzed and has other physical problems that call formedical supervision.   Sadler was discharged Sunday night from a Veterans AdministrationHospital in Cleveland. Hospital spokeswoman Jane Kennedy-Aspis wasnot immediately available for comment Wednesday, her office said.   Hardin said he and Mrs. Sadler believe Sadler's whereabouts areknown by, or he is with, Stephen K. Somers and Paul E. Hill, twoOhio men identified as former members of the U.S. Special Forces,the Green Berets.   The men were identified in a lawsuit filed by Mrs. Sadler inNashville seekng to place her husband under guardianship. She saidshe has not seen her husband since Dec. 26, when she visited him inCleveland.   The singer's mother, Blanche Bebe Sadler of Denver, filed apetition Thursday in Cleveland for guardianship.   Lawyers for Somers and Hill have promised that Sadler will attenda court hearing Friday in Cleveland, where Sadler's competence willbe discussed and a guardian appointed if needed, Hardin said.   ``Their position is Mr. Sadler is competent,'' Hardin said.``They assure me he's in good shape.''   ``We assume and we're hoping that he's in good hands and thathe's going to be brought to court,'' Hardin said. ``We're justconcerned that he gets proper medical treatment.''   ``It's so complicated right now,'' Mrs. Sadler said. ``I want himback in the hospital.''   Sadler's ``Ballad of the Green Berets'' was a No. 1 song in 1966.</TEXT></DOC>
