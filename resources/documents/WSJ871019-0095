Companies cooperating with the investigation include NL Baroid, a division of NL Industries Inc.; M-I Drilling Fluids Co., a joint venture of Dresser Industries Inc. and Halliburton Co.; Oilfield Services Corp. of America, a unit of Great Lakes Chemical Corp.; and closely held Tetra Resources Inc. Officials of the companies confirmed that they were asked by the Justice Department to supply documents, although they denied any wrongdoing.    Some other suppliers of drilling mud, which is purchased in huge quantities for nearly every well drilled in the world, also are said to have been subpoenaed.    Company officials wouldn't describe the scope of the investigation, which, according to people in the industry, is being coordinated by the U.S. attorney's office in Dallas. Alan Payson, chief of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division in Dallas, wouldn't confirm or deny the existence of an investigation.    But a witness who has testified before the grand jury, Keith Sharp of Houston, who formerly operated an offshore-drilling consulting firm, said he told the grand jury that certain suppliers of drilling fluids have &quot;engaged in broad-based antitrust violations, including price fixing.&quot;    In an interview, Mr. Sharp alleged that vendors of drilling and well-completion fluids uniformly raised prices over a week's time in the autumn of 1986, at the depth of the oil industry downturn, particularly for drilling activity. &quot;The prices were all just changed by the various people in the industry and it all happened at once,&quot; Mr. Sharp said. &quot;It was a very dramatic price shift.&quot;    Mr. Sharp, who consulted on well-completion jobs for major oil companies, claimed that he was driven out of business by mud suppliers last year. He said he hurt mud vendors by showing oil companies how to save money on their purchases of drilling fluids.    Drilling mud -- so named for its thick, viscous properties -- consists of minerals and chemicals that are circulated behind a drill bit to keep the hole intact. In addition, it lubricates the drilling operation and carries rock cuttings back to the surface. Completion fluids are used to clean the well, removing elements that would distort the flow of oil or gas. In a major offshore well, the total cost of all drilling fluids can total several hundred thousand dollars.    Like the rest of the oil-service industry, mud suppliers have suffered severely from the downturn in drilling and experienced a ferocious shakeout last year. In 1985, the domestic mud business generated about $100 million of revenue a month, compared with just $44 million now, said Earl Stolz, an analyst at Howard, Weil, Labouisse, Friedrichs Inc. in New Orleans.    While drilling activity fell everywhere, the plunge was especially pronounced in deep-water drilling, which requires a disproportionately prodigious amount of heavily treated mud. &quot;With the hard times, I guess they just got a little bold,&quot; Mr. Sharp asserted.    But the companies that were asked to provide documents said they hadn't engaged in any improper activities. &quot;I certainly feel that we haven't violated any laws,&quot; Robert J. Leidich, general counsel of Dallas-based NL Industries, said, &quot;nor has the government accused us of such.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
