Since gold was first discovered here a century ago, it has been the lifeline of the economy, accounting for nearly half of the country's export earnings today. In the past three years, the precious metal has played an even greater role, deflecting the impact of punitive economic measures against the apartheid government and giving the country an aura of invincibility.    But the precipitous drop in the gold price in 10 trading days earlier this month -- from $428.80 an ounce in New York on Sept. 8 to below $400 on Sept. 21 -- is exposing South Africa's vulnerability to the most-damaging of sanctions yet imposed: the denial of foreign capital. As a result, a looming balance-of-payments crisis is squeezing the country's ability to service its foreign debt. The economic boom that began late last year is coming to an abrupt halt. And Third-World type restrictions, such as import controls, lurk around the corner.    In New York yesterday, gold closed at $397.00 an ounce, up $2.10.    &quot;Sanctions are beginning to bite,&quot; concedes Louis Louw, a spokesman in the Ministry of Finance.    The decline in the gold price couldn't have come at a worse time for South Africa. The country already was grappling with a balance-of-payments problem brought on by the economic expansion and a corresponding surge in imports. Usually, this wouldn't cause much concern if the country had access to foreign borrowing to cover any trade deficits. But since 1985, when international banks first began calling their loans to this country, South Africa has been cut off from foreign lending. Thus, it has had to rely on gold, and other mining revenue to fuel economic growth.    &quot;This is our first expansion since World War II without overseas funds being available,&quot; says Ulrich Joubert, the chief economist of Trust Bank of Africa Ltd. &quot;Now on top of this we get a drop in the gold price. It's a very difficult situation.&quot;    For South Africa, which is the world's largest producer of gold, every $10 drop in the gold price translates into a loss of $200 million in annual revenues. Thus, the $50 fall since July has cost the country $1 billion. This comes at a time when the current account in the first quarter of this year was in deficit by a seasonally adjusted 410 million rand ($164.7 million), the first quarterly deficit since 1984. In the second quarter, South Africa posted a small surplus. With estimated capital outflows of more than two billion rand ($803.6 million) in the second quarter (due to corporate disinvestment and other capital flight), the balance of payments for the first six months of the year is expected to be deeply in the red.    This has set off alarm bells in executive suites across South Africa because the country is facing debt-service payments of about $600 million in each of the next two years. If this isn't covered by a current-account surplus, the country will have to dip into its gold and foreign-exchange reserves, which have shrunk to $2.3 billion in July from $3.2 billion at the end of 1987.    &quot;The reserves can't take too many hits of $600 million,&quot; says Tony Twine of Econometrix, an independent economic consulting firm in Johannesburg. &quot;The other option is that the authorities will have to cool off the economy.&quot;    For a government trying to prevent defections of white supporters to the right-wing Conservative Party, this is an unpopular option. But business executives and economists say that if imports are to be curbed to generate a current-account surplus, the economy will have to slow to an annual growth rate of 1.5% by next year from the 5% growth registered in the fourth quarter of 1987. Economists reckon that a minimum growth rate of 5% is needed to provide enough jobs for the expanding labor force.    &quot;With the gold price dropping and no overseas financing available, we have to tell the domestic economy 'Okay, you have to take the rap again,'&quot; says Mr. Joubert of Trust Bank.    Last month the government slapped surcharge taxes on a range of imports, and some business executives are urging the authorities to go further and impose import controls and begin foreign-currency allocations. In addition, most economists expect interest rates to rise a couple of percentage points by the end of the year, from the current prime rate of 16%. Should the gold price continue to tumble to $350 an ounce, they warn interest rates could rise to 20% and trigger a rash of corporate insolvencies and a further plunge in business confidence. </TEXT></DOC>
