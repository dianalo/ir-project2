Brophy as chairman and chief executive officer next April.    Mr. Brophy had said earlier he would name his successor in January. He said he moved up the date to avoid further speculation about his successor. Though Mr. Johnson has been considered the front-runner since he was named president in March 1986, those inside and outside the Stamford, Conn.-based company had speculated that Mr. Brophy could choose any one of four other GTE executives.    The choice of Mr. Johnson further solidifies GTE's long-term strategy of being primarily a telephone operating company with smaller interests in lighting and precision materials, analysts said. Mr. Johnson, 60 years old, said in an interview that he intends to expand GTE's lighting and precision materials business by buying related companies, mostly outside the U.S.    &quot;I'm very comfortable with where we are right now and I stand firmly committed to our strategy,&quot; Mr. Johnson said. He said he intends to &quot;vigorously&quot; pursue lighting and precision materials acquisitions, but doesn't see making acquisitions in the defense electronics business, where GTE also has a presence.    &quot;While we've looked at (defense) acquisitions, I don't see growing that business with acquisitions,&quot; he said, because GTE isn't interested in acquiring the extra staff that usually goes with such transactions.    In telecommunications, &quot;our biggest challenge is to grow new businesses and continue growth in others,&quot; Mr. Johnson said. He said he doesn't anticipate making any more joint ventures. GTE already has three joint ventures, one in the long-distance phone service business, one in the phone switch business, and another in telephone equipment for businesses.    Mr. Johnson, who has kept the drawl of his native town, Vernon, Texas, said he doesn't intend to quickly name a successor to his current job of president and chief operating officer. The four executives who were considered candidates for the posts of chairman and chief executive probably will be seen as contenders. The executives are senior vice presidents James L. Broadhead, 52; Allan L. Rayfield, 52; Charles R. Lee, 47; and Edward C. Schmults, 56.    But analysts said Mr. Johnson remained the obvious choice to succeed Mr. Brophy, who reaches the mandatory retirement age of 65 next April. &quot;It's a move that will be fully supported both inside and outside&quot; GTE, Mr. Brophy said. Mr. Johnson has a solid background running telephone operating companies, though at times he has exhibited awkwardness in public speaking. He gained his nickname while playing left end on his high school football team.    &quot;Rocky is a great general manager,&quot; said Jack B. Grubman of PaineWebber Inc. &quot;He will now have to prove he has a strategic focus and vision. But what we've seen in the telecommunications business is that the sucessful managers are the ones that are good general managers, not these flash-in-the-pan marketing guys.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
