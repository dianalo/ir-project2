(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Severe weather early Sunday in thiswestern Alabama city damaged houses, downed power lines and injuredan undetermined number of people, authorities said.   J. Danny Cooper, director of the Alabama Emergency ManagementAgency, said a tornado apparently touched down in Tuscaloosa about12:45 a.m.   However, Joe Wheeler, a meteorologist with the National WeatherService in Birmingham, could not immediately confirm the tornadoreport. He said an inspection would determine whether a twistercaused the damage.   Cooper said it was difficult to immediately assess the damagesince the storm hit in the middle of the night and knocked out powerin much of the area.   ``I would say it would be in the morning before we'll know thetotal number of people injured,'' Cooper said from his agency'sMontgomery headquarters. ``This is very difficult situation in thedead of the night.''   A Tuscaloosa police dispatcher who refused to give her name saidpeople were hurt but she did not know how many or the seriousness oftheir injuries.   Tuscaloosa County was under a severe thunderstorm warning whenthe tornado was reported.   Cooper said Gov. Guy Hunt had authorized the Alabama NationalGuard to provide emergency lights and generators to aid rescueworkers, who were moving door-to-door to assess the damage.</TEXT></DOC>
