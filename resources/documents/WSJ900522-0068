A trader said no one knows where the bottom is. Theweighted index, which tumbled 510.21 points Friday, fell424.07, or 5.72%, to finish at 6992.89, the lowest closinglevel since Feb. 27, 1989, when the index ended at 6885.51.

The market was closedSaturday because of a typhoon.   The market opened firmer because of Taiwan President LeeTeng Hui's inauguration speech Sunday, calling for an end tofour decades of hostilities with the rival Communistgovernment in Beijing. The market expected that a changedpolicy toward China would bring Taiwan manufacturers moretrade opportunities.   The reports stimulated buying and drove the market up morethan 160 points in the first 15 minutes. But this strengthebbed, after investors showed little interest in buying athighs. The market tone turned weak and dropped rapidly at theclose.   &quot;Investors are now in a panic, and selling becomes theonly direction,&quot; Hsu Daw Yi, vice president of Core PacificSecurities Co., said. &quot;Volatility is expected to continue.&quot;He blamed the recent market weakness on shaky confidence andconcerns about capital outflow. The market has plunged1576.66 points, or 18.4%, since last Wednesday.   In Frankfurt, the equities market also was sapped by thesoft West German bond and bond futures markets, which openedlower and remained weak. The weighted DAX Index, compiled atthe close, fell 32.41 points, or 1.76%, to 1811.18. Thenarrower FAZ Index, calculated at midday, was down 16.45points to 771.70.   The DAX is near the 1800 lower end of the trading rangeforecast for the second quarter, which previously had aprojected high point of about 2000. The index's historicalhigh was set March 30 at 1968.55; the low on Jan. 28, 1988,at 931.18.   The market continued to be whipped by investor reactionsto developments in monetary unification. Worries were citedthat the opposition Social Democrats may try to change thesubstance or timing of the reunification plan. And there isconcern about the weakness of the West German seniorcoalition partner, the Christian Democrats, after the party'ssetback in two state elections last week.   A market rumor Monday had Bundesbank President Karl OttoPoehl resigning soon, but the central bank denied this.   Price declines were spread across the board, paced by bluechips such as Daimler-Benz, the diversified automotive giant,which ended down 16 marks ($9.71) at 807 marks. Auto makerBMW slipped 12 to 571, Volkswagen was down 9 at 579, andPorsche fell 39 to 1,120.   Deutsche Bank fell 14.50 to 761, Commerzbank was off 20 at277, and Dresdner Bank edged 5.5 lower to 25.

In Tokyo, the Nikkei index of 225 issues lost 248.67points to close at 31765.05, but was up from the intraday lowof 31605.33. The index shed 47.88 points Friday.   At midmorning in Tokyo Tuesday, the Nikkei index was up41.86 points to 31806.91.   On Monday, investors' participation slowed because ofdiscouraging moves lower by the yen.

Traders said investors were unable to decide which stocksto buy, as few attractively priced stocks were left after therecent recovery of stock prices. They also attributed therecent sluggish trading to the major brokerage houses' annualpersonnel changes that occurred last week.   Daifuku, which predicted Friday that its pretax profitwill increase 47% in fiscal 1990, rose as high as 2,220 yen($14.51) before closing at 2,170, up 40.

The FT30-share index closed up 17.5 points at 1810.8. Volume was athin 316.2 million shares, down from 594.8 million on Friday.   London shares largely ignored Britain's provisional moneysupply figures for April, which exceeded forecasts, as banklending shrank. Traders said Wall Street gains late inLondon's session helped boost shares.   Associated British Foods gained 2 pence to 390 pence($6.59), after it posted a 20% jump in pretax profit for theyear ended March 31, in line with expectations.   Carlton Communications plunged 25% to 515, despite aninterim report that pretax profit rose 54% to #64.9 million($109.7 million), though profit-taking was cited.Profit-taking battered other issues.
