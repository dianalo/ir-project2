Background on the West Virginia Program</ITAG>On January 21, 1981, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approvedthe West Virginia program. Information concerning the general backgroundof the program includes the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments,and an explanation of the initial conditions of approval of the West Virginiaprogram. This can be found in the January 21, 1981, <T4>Federal Register</T4> (46 FR 5915-5956). Subsequent actions concerningproposed amendments and the conditions of approval are codified at 30 CFR948.11, 948.12, 948.13, 948.15, and 948.16.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Discussion of Proposed Amendments</ITAG>On August 19, 1986, pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(f)(1), OSMRE provided WestVirginia a list of 221 items (Administrative Record No. WV 711) in itsprogram determined by OSMRE to be less effective than the Federal requirements.On October 22, 1986, the West Virginia Department of Energy (DOE) respondedto OSMRE's list of concerns. Of the 221 deficiencies, DOE indicated that166 would require regulatory changes; 8 statutory changes; and 10 policychanges. DOE also indicated that 26 were already considered to be as effectiveas the Federal requirements and eleven would require detailed review. DOEsuggested a schedule for addressing the deficiencies (Administrative RecordNo. WV 712). The proposed schedule was modified several times to establishpriorities and to consider State Legislature concerns and Federal regulationamendments.On October 20, 1987, DOE submitted proposed regulatory changes to OSMREfor informal review that were intended to satisfy all 221 regulatory reformissues.On December 18, 1987, OSMRE advised DOE that a review identified 204 remainingissues (Administrative Record No. WV 748).On January 18, 1988, the State provided OSMRE its revised coal refuse disposalregulations (section 22) for informal review. On January 20, 1988, DOEsubmitted revised regulations to the Legislative Rulemaking Review Committeewhich were to satisfy most of OSMRE's December 18th concerns. The WestVirginia Legislature adjourned in March 1988 without adopting DOE's proposedregulations.On July 7, 1988, DOE submitted a proposed amendment to OSMRE that containedsurface mining reclamation regulations and coal refuse disposal regulationswhich West Virginia also filed with its Secretary of State on an emergencybasis on July 15, 1988 (Administrative Record No. WV 756).On August 9, 1988, DOE formally submitted to OSMRE a copy of its new proposedsurface mining reclamation regulations. The revisions were intended tosatisfy all of OSMRE's regulatory reform issues and five of the State'sprogram conditions (Administrative Record No. WV 760).On September 9, 1988, DOE held a public hearing on the revised legislativerules, and on September 19, 1988, DOE submitted its revised rules to theLegislative Rulemaking Review Committee for consideration. Because theseregulations are intended to repeal the emergency regulations that wereadopted on July 15, 1988, and subsequently revised on August 5, 1988, theseregulations are commonly referred to as the ``repealer package''.On November 9, 1988, OSMRE provided West Virginia with a second list of13 State regulations which were determined to be less effective than Federalregulations promulgated between October 1, 1983, and June 15, 1988. OSMREgave the State sixty days to submit either proposed amendments or a descriptionof amendments to be proposed to address the identified deficiencies (AdministrativeRecord No. WV 762).On December 28, 1988, DOE submitted additional revisions to its regulationswhich were intended to satisfy OSMRE's concerns of November 9, 1988. TheState included the proposed revisions in the repealer package so that theywould receive consideration by the Legislative Rulemaking Review Committeeduring the 1989 regular session (Administrative Record No. WV 769).On March 30, 1989, DOE provided OSMRE with fifty-four amendments to therepealer package. The proposed amendments were submitted to the State SenateCommittee on Energy, Industry and Mining and approved on March 27, 1989(Administrative Record No. WV 771).On April 8, 1989, the West Virginia Legislature passed DOE's surface miningreclamation regulations with revisions.On April 17, 1989, DOE provided OSMRE a copy of part of the regulationsthat were approved by the Legislature (Administrative Record No. WV 772).Because the submittal did not include the State's proposed regulatory reformrevisions of December 28, 1988, DOE resubmitted revised regulations onApril 26, 1989, which contain all amendments passed by the West VirginiaLegislature (Administrative Record No. WV 775). These new regulations weresubmitted as a program amendment and preempt the July 7, 1988, and August8, 1988, submittals.On April 18, 1989, OSMRE requested that DOE delay finalizing the proposedregulations until they are approved by OSMRE. Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(g),no changes to regulations that make up an approved program can take effectuntil they are approved by OSMRE as an amendment (Administrative RecordNo. WV 773).As discussed above, the State's regulations were revised to resolve overtwo hundred inconsistencies that were identified by OSMRE as a result ofchanges in Federal regulations. The revisions concern inspection and enforcement,civil penalties, small operator assistance program, blasting, prime farmland,topsoil handling, backfilling and grading, fish and wildlife protection,excess spoil disposal, bonding, revegetation, coal exploration, designatinglands unsuitable, historic preservation, hydrology, geology, diversions,siltation structures and impoundments, subsidence control, coal refusedisposal, permitting and other miscellaneous provisions.In addition, DOE substantially revised the format of its regulations. Therequirements governing support facilities, surface mining and undergroundmining operations have been combined, and its coal refuse disposal requirements,which were separate, have been included in the revised surface coal miningreclamation regulations. On March 27, 1989, the Legislature adopted 54amendments concerning applicability, definitions of active and inactivesurface mining operations, ownership and control, head of hollow fills,readvertisement of permit applications, preplans, subsidence control plans,parks and historic lands, hydrologic information, overburden analysis,permit renewals, incidental boundary revisions, permit conditions, sedimentcontrol structures, bond forfeiture, underground discharges, steep slopemining, inactive status, backfilling and regrading, availability of permitapplications, inspection frequencies and enforcement actions.The State also made the same revisions to these regulations which weremade earlier to its emergency regulations in order to satisfy five of theremaining six conditions of program approval at 30 CFR 948.11(a) concerningaugering on previously mined areas, coal refuse disposal, applicant violatorinformation, coal exploration, revegetation success standards and the issuanceof show cause orders for pattern of violations. An announcement regardingthese and other revisions to the emergency regulations appeared in the<T4>Federal Register </T4>on April 21, 1989 (54 FR 16136-16138). Becausethe State has requested that its recent submission preempt its July 7,1988, and August 8, 1988, submittals, OSMRE's formal review will be limitedto the April 26th submission. Any comments received from the public onthe revised emergency regulations will be considered in light of this submission.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Public Comment Procedures</ITAG>In accordance with the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17, OSMRE is now seekingcomments on the proposed amendments submitted by the State of West Virginiato its permanent regulatory program. Specifically, OSMRE is seeking commentson DOE's revised surface coal mining reclamation regulations, Title 38,Series 2, that were submitted on April 26, 1989 (Administrative RecordNo. WV 775). Comments should address whether the proposed amendments arein accordance with SMCRA and no less effective than its implementing regulations.If approved, the amendments will become part of the West Virginia permanentregulatory program.Written CommentsWritten comments should be specific, pertain only to the issues proposedin this rulemaking and include explanations in support of the commenter'srecommendations. Comments received after the time indicated under <T2>``DATES''</T2> or at locations other than the OSMRE Charleston FieldOffice will not necessarily be considered and included in the AdministrativeRecord for the final rulemaking.Public HearingPersons wishing to comment at the public hearing should contact the personlisted under <T2>``FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT''</T2> by the close of business onJune 12, 1989. If no one has requested an opportunity to participate inthe hearing by that date, the hearing will not be held.Filing of a written statement at the time of the hearing is requested asit will greatly assist the transcriber.
