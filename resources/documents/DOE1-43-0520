<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-43-0520 </DOCNO><TEXT>Two types of proportional chambers used in experiments with SIGMA setare considered. The main parameters of detecting electronics, high-voltage,low-voltage and gas supplies are presented. The first type chambers consistof the round or square frames of sheet foiled glass-cloth-base laminate,on which surface electrode lands and joints between them are appliedby photographic printing. The second type chamber electrodes are alsomade of the sheet foiled glass-cloth-base laminate as strips arrangedat the ends of two rectangular metallic profiles. The chamber sensitiveregions vary from 64x64 mm to 768x2500 mm. The chambers are used formore than 15 years in different experiments, such as determination ofelastic scattering, study of J/psi and psi' particle production, searchfor charm particles in hadron interactions, measuring the change of {pi}/sup-/-meson polarizability, study of {mu}/sup +/{mu}-/sup {pi}/- systemproduction. The experience of past years manifested their high efficiencyand reliability. 6 refs.; 10 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
