The move, which has been discussed with Japan's Ministry of Finance, will bring tax benefits to the banks and also should help curb the growth of their loans to Brazil, which currently total about $10 billion. International banks now are contributing to a new $5.2 billion loan for Brazil, which is due to be completed shortly.    The Cayman Islands company, JBA Investment Inc., formed by 28 Japanese banks in early 1987, was planned as a dumping place for a large amount of these banks' shaky Latin American credits.    But, Japanese and other international bankers said, there have been disagreements within the Ministry of Finance between the tax bureau and the banking bureau about what quantity of loans banks should be allowed to place in the new vehicle. The tax bureau apparently is reluctant to allow banks to gain large amounts of tax losses in this fashion, while the banking bureau is more concerned that banks be allowed to reduce their shaky credits and strengthen their capital.    Last year Japan's banks placed a total of about $600 million of Mexican loans and a smaller amount of Argentine loans into the shell company. Initial plans called for the banks to place billions of dollars of loans into the new company. </TEXT></DOC>
