Bush, the Republican nominee for president, was the seniorgovernment representative and featured speaker at Longhorn ArmyAmmunition Plant in northeast Texas for a ceremony marking thedestruction of the first U.S. weapons under the U.S.-SovietIntermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty.   The event provided a highly telegenic campaign showcase anddovetailed into Bush's themes of peace and prosperity.   In a state where 29 electoral votes are up for grabs in a closerace, Bush also campaigned in Tyler and criticized Dukakis forsupporting a nuclear freeze as the INF missiles were being deployedin Western Europe in response to a Soviet builduip.   ``He wanted to restrain us, not the Soviet Union,'' Bush told anenthusiastic Tyler crowd. ``Therein lies a big difference betweenGeorge Bush and the governor of Massachusetts.''   In a setting designed for television cameras, Bush was joined onstage by the Apache Belles, an all-female drill team from TylerJunior College, dressed in cowgirl hats and swimming suit-styleoutfits decorated with fringe.   ``I want to see us build on this record of peace throughstrength and it can't be done if we have a naive view of the SovietUnion,'' Bush said, attacking Dukakis anew for opposing the MX andMidgetmen missiles, the Strategic Defense Initiative, the B-1bomber and two aircraft carrier task forces.   ``He asks for nothing in return,'' Bush said. ``We must not _and if I am elected I will not _ make unilateral concessions to Mr.Gorbachev or the Soviet Union.''   Sheila Tate, press secretary to Bush, said the cost of Bush'stravel to the rocket-destruction in Karnack and related expenseswere being paid out of campaign funds, although Bush aides said itwas not a campaign event.   In another development, she said the vice president _ in areversal of policy _ supports an increase in the minimum wage,which has been fixed for seven years at $3.35 an hour. She did notsay how large a hike he favors.   Bush, in an interview in Tyler, acknowledged that he goes out ofhis way not to mention Dukakis' running mate, fellow Texan LloydBentsen.   ``I keep crossing it out (from proposed speeches) when peoplesend it in there,'' Bush said. ``I'm running against the governorof Massachusetts, very liberal.''   In Karnack, the ground trembled in vibration for 58 seconds asthe motor of a Pershing II missile was ignited and burned its solidfuel rocket propellant. Bolted in concrete and steel, the motorremained stationary as it shot back a fiery tail and thick blossomsof white smoke.   The motor of a less-powerful Pershing 1-A missile was destroyedthe same way. It burned off in 37 seconds. After the firing, thePershing 1-A motor was hauled by forklift to a crushing machine anddestroyed. The larger Pershing II motor was to be destroyed laterafter it cooled down.   Bush, standing on a speaker's platform 1,300 feet away, watchedthe firing through binoculars.   When the smoke cleared, Bush declared, ``This has been aspectacular day. God bless you. This has been a great day.''   The Kremlin began destroying some of its missiles July 22 and asof Sept. 6 had eliminated 92 rockets.   After viewing the rocket-engine crushing and pronouncing it``well done,'' the vice president was presented with two metalfragments. He said he would give one to President Reagan and keepthe other for himself.   Soviet officials at the event also gave him fragments of theirdestroyed rockets.   ``I hope the direction we're going in, in terms of destructionand verifiable reductions, continues,'' Bush said. ``That was themessage I got there today. And I think the Soviets felt the sameway, the ones I talked to there.''   Under the treaty, signed in Washington last December by Reaganand Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, the United States and SovietUnion are required to destroy all nuclear missiles with a range of300 to 3,400 miles within three years.   Officials of the Soviet Embassy in Washington and a team ofSoviet inspectors from Moscow were flown here to witness thedestruction of the U.S. weapons. ``We have become the eyewitnessesof significant events,'' said Nikolai Shabolin, the chief Sovietinspector.   Bush, in brief remarks, said, ``We are witnessing today one ofthose unique moments in the career of man. ... This was the day webegan to reverse the arms race; this was the day we begandestroying the weapons of destruction.''   Bush then flew to Rockford, Ill., where he planned to addressthe Illinois Federation of Republican women. Bush told a crowd ofabout 200 well-wishers at the airport that ``Illinois is going tobe a battleground.''   ``This is one of the critical four or five states in the entirecountry,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
