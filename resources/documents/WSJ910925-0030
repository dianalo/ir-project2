The Houston company, which builds and operates gas-firedcogeneration power plants, expects net income to be at least$80 million, or $1.35 a share, compared with $70 million, or$1.56 a share, in 1990. Per-share figures reflect an increasein common shares outstanding to about 62.5 million from about45 million a year ago.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Goff, in an interview, agreed with estimates that 1991revenue will be about $412 million, flat with last year.   &quot;But our growth rate is 15% to 20% a year. That's thetrack we're on,&quot; he said. &quot;That's our expected growth ratefor the next few years, too.&quot;   Destec has a five-year order backlog, Mr. Goff said. Infact, he said, the company is too busy to handle more ordersfor new plants. &quot;Our growth right now isn't limited by marketforces. It's limited by our people resources,&quot; he said.   The company is seeking to acquire competitors who havecontracts that can be purchased along with their assets. Mr.Goff said Destec has about $160 million in cash and virtuallyno debt.   Destec, whose power-plant building has been entirely inNorth America, is searching for its first foreign projects.</TEXT></DOC>
