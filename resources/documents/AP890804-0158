(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The federal government has yet to buy asingle apple under its $15 million bailout of the Alar-plaguedindustry, but its emergency program is already a rousing success inthe orchards.   The market for apples has improved so dramatically in the pastmonth that there is speculation there will not be a surplus even ifthe government fails to buy any apples. There could even beshortages.   Retailers and industry officials credit the federal buyout planannounced July 7 with restoring consumer confidence in apples,which jumped 20 percent in sales and as much as 50 percent inwholesale price last month.   ``The increase in sales is because of the added reassurance tothe public,'' said Vicky Sanders, a spokeswoman for Vons Cos., achain of 342 food stores based in El Monte, Calif.   ``The federal government is saying that apples are safe, and Ithink it has had an effect on consumers,'' said Robert Keeney, anadministrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service of U.S.Department of Agriculture, which runs the program.   While the buyout already has had the desired effect ofincreasing sales and prices, the Agriculture Department has nointention of halting planned purchases, Keeney said from WashingtonD.C.   ``If we don't go ahead, it would have an adverse effect on themarketplace, and we would certainly lose credibility with theindustry,'' Keeney said.   Recent statistics indicate the government's plan to purchase asmany as 2 million 42-pound boxes of apples is unnecessary.   In the past three weeks, Washington growers have shipped 2.7million boxes of apples out of state. Washington grows half thenation's apples but has about 90 percent of the remaining U.S.warehouse supply.   There were just 3.5 million boxes of apples left in the state'swarehouses as of Aug. 1, and if sales continued at the same rate asin July, the entire surplus would be gone by the end of this monthjust as havesting of the 1989 crop begins.   But Tom Hale, president of the Washington State AppleCommission, said it is wrong to assume that sales will remain sohat high in August when there is considerable competition fromother fruits.   ``To expect that we could sell that volume in August would befantasy land,'' said Hale, noting such sales would break recordsfor the month.   The average sales in August for the past six years have been 1.9million boxes, said Walt Shields of the Yakima ValleyGrowers-Shippers Association.   The industry became worried this summer when warehouseinventories climbed to twice the norm as concern over Alardepressed sales.   Industry leaders aggressively pursued the federal apple purchaseas a way to clean out warehouses and boost prices that had fallenbelow the cost of production.   ``The market was headed for a black hole and this probablyprevented it from going into the black hole,'' said Derl Derr,president of the International Apple Institute in McLean, Va.,which represents many of the 20,000 growers in the nation's $1billion apple industry.   Under the program, apples and apple juice will be shipped tocharitable organizations, with the government reimbursingwarehouses for the fruit.   Keeney said 56 apple warehouses offered apples to the buyoutprogram by Wednesday. Under the program, warehouses offer a certainnumber of apples and name a price. The government will not pay morethan $8.20 per box.   An announcement on exactly how many apples the government willbuy and how much it will spend will come Tuesday, Keeney said.   The industry's troubles were created by the Alar controversythat began in February when a consumer group said eating applestreated with the growth regulator increased cancer risk inchildren. That report by the Natural Resources Defense Council hasbeen disputed, but its impact on the market was undeniable.   Prices for the top grade of red apples fell to $8 per box. Butsince the government announcement, they have risen to between $10and $12 per box, prices well above the ceiling of $8.20 thegovernment intends to pay.</TEXT></DOC>
