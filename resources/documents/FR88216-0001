The regulations impose restrictions on the interstate movement of regulatedarticles from quarantined areas in order to prevent the spread of the Mediterraneanfruit fly to noninfested areas of the United States. The regulations alsodesignated soil, and a large number of fruits, nuts, vegetables, and berries,as regulated articles. Based on trapping surveys conducted by inspectors of the United StatesDepartment of Agriculture and state agencies of California, we have determinedthat the Mediterranean fruit fly has been eradicated from the infestedareas of Los Angeles County. The last finding of Mediterranean fruit flywas made on September 3, 1987. Since then, no evidence of infestationshas been found. We have determined that infestations no longer exist inLos Angeles County. <ITAG tagnum="84">Immediate Action </ITAG>James W. Glosser, Acting Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health InspectionService, has determined that a situation exists that warrants publicationof this interim rule without prior opportunity for public comment. Theareas in Los Angeles County were quarantined due to the possibility thatthe Mediterranean fruit fly could be spread artificially from this areato noninfested areas of the United States. Since this situation no longerexists, and because the quarantined status of these portions of Los AngelesCounty imposes an unnecessary regulatory burden on the public, we are takingimmediate action to remove the Mediterranean fruit fly regulations. Since prior notice and other public procedures with respect to this interimrule are impracticable and contrary to the public interest under thesecircumstances, and because this rule relieves a regulatory restriction,there is good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553 to make this interim rule effectiveupon signature. We will consider comments that are postmarked or receivedwithin 60 days of publication of this interim rule in the<T4> Federal Register.</T4> As soon as possible after the comment periodcloses, we will publish another document in the<T4> Federal Register</T4> discussing the comments we received and anyamendments we are making to the rule as a result of the comments. <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 and Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>We are issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12291, andwe have determined it is not a ``major rule.'' Based on information compiledby the Department, we have determined that this rule will have an effecton the economy of less than $100 million; will not cause a major increasein costs or prices for consumers, individuals, industries, Federal, state,or local government agencies, or geographic regions; and will not causea significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment, productivity,innovation, or the ability of United States-based enterprises to competewith foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets. For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived the reviewprocess required by Executive Order 12291. Within the part of Los Angeles County that was quarantined, there are approximately150 small entities that may be affected, including 87 mobile and eightstationary fruit stands, 40 wholesale produce dealers 15 nurseries, andone farmers' market. The effect of this rule on these entities should beinsignificant, since most of their sales are local intrastate and werenot affected by the regulatory provisions we are removing; those salesthat were affected were generally of articles that could be moved aftercompliance with treatment or inspection provisions of the regulations.Based on these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and PlantHealth Inspection Service has determined that this action will not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>The regulations in this subpart contain no information collection or recordkeepingrequirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501<T3> et seq.</T3>). <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12372 </ITAG>This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistanceunder No. 10.025 and is subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372,which requires intergovernmental consultation with state and local officials.(See 7 CFR Part 3015, Subpart V.) <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 301 </ITAG>Agricultural commodities, Plant diseases, Plant pests, Plants (Agriculture),Quarantine, Transportation, Mediterranean fruit fly, Incorporation by reference.Accordingly, 7 CFR Part 301 is amended as follows: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 301_DOMESTIC QUARANTINE NOTICES </ITAG>1.
