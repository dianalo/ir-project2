(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>STAKING MVS CLAIM, SPREADING VSE ROOTSandM;Goal Systems International, Inc. historically has been a strong player in thesystems software market for IBM mainframes running DOS/VSE, which until lastyear was being phased out.andM;But with a series of acquisitions dating back to the Phoenix computer-basedtraining system from Ohio State University in 1978, and culminating mostrecently with the acquisition of MVS Software--a rising star in the datacenter automation business--Goal has now established a firm beachhead in theMVS market.andM;The combination has transmogrified a company that has done its time in thesystems software business.andP;  The suite of VSE products is countered perhapsonly by Computer Associates (CA), and the MVS incursion positions theColumbus, Ohio-based Goal competitively in the automation market with Legent,Candle Corp., Boole andamp; Babbage and CA.andP;  Despite Goal's VSE reputation, some48% of its systems software revenue came from MVS products last year (versus39% in fiscal 1987).andM;After paying over $60 million in the past year for fouracquisitions--Database Utility Group, Essential Software, Tower Systems andMVS Software--Goal is concentrating today on integrating the new products andpeople into its own culture.andP;  That is no small challenge and a substantialrisk for a company with a very clear identity.andM;Founder and chairman James A. Rutherford seems to have pushed the rightbuttons at the right time.andP;  He built a strong base of products, grew revenueat a healthy rate in the early years, then brought in professional marketingskills with Rick Pinson, former director of marketing, now vice president ofcorporate services.andM;A CHARTER TO GO PUBLICandM;As growth continued at an increasing rate through the 1980s, thoughts turnedto going public.andP;  The timing was wrong in 1984 and 1987, so Goal waited.andP;  Thecompany hired David Wetmore, a CPA and managing partner from Peat Marwick inColumbus, as president in 1988 expressly to help execute and follow up theinitial public offering, held in May 1989.andM;Wetmore most Rutherford in 1984 when he recommended that Goal audit itsbooks.andP;  &quot;The company had been run like a public company from day one,&quot;Wetmore said, referring to the quality of its financial reports.andP;  In 1988,concerned that he needed a different type of manager to bring the company toits next stage of growth, Rutherford approached Wetmore about being presidentof Goal.andP;  At first, &quot;I was not really interested,&quot; Wetmore said.andM;A director from General Atlantic convinced Wetmore that slow mainframe saleswere not indicative of a poor opportunity.andM;Eventually convinced of the software industry's potential, Wetmore and Goal'sboard evaluated each other.andP;  &quot;They chewed me up over five or six days,&quot; hesaid.andP;  Then Wetmore did his own evaluation.andP;  &quot;I have confidence that theboard is committed to building a quality company.andP;  That gave me theconfidence to switch jobs.&quot;andM;Wetmore came on in August 1988, with a charter to bring the company publicwithin one or two years.andP;  The initial public offering was conducted in thespring of 1989 and raised $14 million.andP;  This gave the firm the means tofollow through on its acquisition strategy: firming up the grip on the VSEmarket and building a strong product line for the MVS market.andM;Goal's stock was issued at $9.75; it closed at $15.50 at year-end.andP;  &quot;Thesupport level appears to be about $14,&quot; said Thomas Kelley, Goal's VP offinance.andP;  The company closed its fiscal year Jan. 31 with $69.2 million inrevenue, a 33% increase, and $10.7 million in earnings.andP;  Goal spends 13%-14%of its revenues on research and development, Kelly said.andM;Goal expects acquisition costs of $5 million or so to affect its firstquarter earnings.andP;  &quot;This year will be an assimilation year,&quot; said Kelley.andM;The acquisitions have increased Goal's sales force from 55 to 85, with mostof the increase coming from MVS-oriented salespeople.andP;  Overseas, Goal has 38systems software sales representatives who grew international revenue by 40%in fiscal 1990, according to a recent report by Jim Poyner of William K.andO;Woodruff andamp; Co., Inc., Dallas.andM;Pinson said, &quot;We will be able to follow those products into a strongerdistribution channel and exceed the rate of growth we would normally expect.&quot;andM;A PHONE CALL IN 1975andM;In the beginning, there was no thought of greatness.andP;  The firm was initiatedby a phone call from founder Steve R. O'Donnell to Rutherford in 1975.andP;  Thetwo had met at Westinghouse Electric Corp. O'Donnell, an electrical engineerwho had previously worked for IBM, wrote a linkage editor for IBM mainframescalled Flee, which is still sold today.andP;  (O'Donnell left Goal in 1986 forpersonal reasons.)andM;Rutherford was at Cincom Systems at the time, working on the Environ/1companion product to the Total database, a competitive alternative to IBM'sCICS.andP;  Rutherford joined O'Donnell and the two sold Flee over the phone froma Columbus apartment to IBM mainframe sites.andM;Rutherford encouraged then-fellow Cincom employee Neal Ater to join him.andP;  Afresh college graduate in computer science, Ater was also working on thedevelopment of Total.andP;  Because Cincom owned no computers of its own in thoseearly days, the programmers worked at keypunch machines, and brought theircards to nearby Mead Paper to cut magnetic tapes.andM;Ater was working on an indexing scheme for Total that a customer at ClevelandTrust was impatient to get.andP;  After his boss told him to deliver the software,Ater got on a plane to Cleveland carrying a box of cards with the assemblyerrors marked.andP;  He found a sympathetic manager at Cleveland Trust, who lefthim alone in an office for a month while he completed the program.andP;  Today,Ater is vice president of development at Goal.andM;Rutherford explained, &quot;We started as a company that never expected to be morethan a few software developers that hawked their software.andP;  We did not startwith grand ideas of being the conquerors of the software industry.andP;  All wewanted to do was make a living, be independent and enjoy our careers.&quot;andM;Rutherford found software presented him with an elusive opportunity.andP;  When hegot his first exposure to a computer in 1968 and read a Fortran manual, &quot;Ifell absolutely in love with it.&quot;andP;  He compared it to the work of craftsmen.andO;&quot;You start out with nothing, you use logic and you make something.andP;  It isbasically an intellectual endeavor.&quot;andM;The founders concentrated on writing software for IBM mainframes and focusingon their customers' needs.andP;  While the &quot;customer responsiveness&quot; value isdifficult to measure, it seems real at Goal.andP;  Systems programmer Pete Clarkof Olan Mills, Chattanooga, Tenn., a user of Goal products, said, &quot;They'vedone an absolutely excellent job.andP;  I wish all software vendors could meettheir standards, including IBM.andP;  IBM could learn some important lessons fromthe way Goal handles their customers.&quot;andM;&quot;Our founding philosophies turned out to be successful,&quot; Rutherford said.andO;Success meant that money was rolling in, and Goal's management had to decidewhat to do with it.andP;  &quot;We were all people who grew up in middle classfamilies.andP;  A new Dasher was a big deal to me,&quot; Rutherford said.andP;  &quot;So wedecided to put the money back into the company.&quot;andP;  (No one at the company hasever made more than $300,000 in a year, he said.)andM;Soon, the first sales rep was hired.andP;  &quot;We were all technicians at the time.andO;We were embarrassed to call him a salesman, so we called him 'director ofinvestor relations,'&quot; he said.andM;STRONG MIDWEST CULTUREandM;Goal started surveying the market for takeover candidates over two years ago.andO;&quot;In the case of Tower, the dialogue started three or four years ago,&quot; anddiscussions with Essential and MBS Software began two years ago, saidRutherford.andP;  &quot;Everyone else thought the companies were not for sale.andP;  We justup the discussions.andP;  Eventually, all three companies decided we would be thepreferred partner.&quot;andM;In many be something intangible related to Goal's Midwestern roots thatconvinced these entrepreneurs to join forces.andP;  Goal typically lets go 15% ofan acquired company's work force, by eliminating overlapping administrativejobs and hanging on to developers and key salespersons.andP;  Ater says that nokey developer has left an acquired company.andP;  &quot;People here have a can-doattitude,&quot; Rutherford said.andP;  &quot;We don't have labor problems.&quot;andM;SOFTWARE OASISandM;Columbus is a sort of oasis in the Rust Belt, a service economy of banks,insurance firms, universities and software companies, including Goal andInformation Dimensions, which markets the Basis line of text managementproducts.andP;  Goal employees typically work 50 to 60 hours per week.andP;  &quot;Columbusis a good place to run a business,&quot; Wetmore said.andP;  &quot;And there are not a lotof diversions in certain times of the year,&quot; such as when Ohio State is notin its football season.andM;As the Goal executive with responsibility for operations, Pinson has seen hisplace travel increase since the acquisitions picked up.andP;  &quot;A lot of Goal'sculture is a Midwestern culture.andP;  Trying to merge that successfully withseveral offices and a highly visible presence on the West Coast will be thereal challege for me this year,&quot; Pinson stated.andM;Goal's success has come not without a bit of luck.andP;  When IBM in 1989 turnedaround its decision to stabilize DOS/VSE.andP;  Goal was a beneficiary.andP;  &quot;That isa big customer base for us,&quot; Rutherford said.andP;  But with the high-end AS/400competing with IBM's low-end mainframes, &quot;We view MVS as a more rapidlygrowing area than VSE.&quot;andM;Although MVS is more strategic to IBM, and spending per MVS data center ismuch higher than VSE data centers, VSE still appears to have a substantiallife left.andP;  Some of this boost is coming from IBM's 9370 midrange machine,which runs VSE in native mode, and some is coming from compatible low-endmainframes from Hitachi Data Systems.andP;  Sears, Roebuck, for example, recentlycommitted to rolling out 9370 machines running VSE nationwide with Goal'spackages among their management software.andP;  IBM itself is expected to providea boost this summer with a 43XX follow-on machine and an updated VSE.andM;Besides its new-found position in the MVS data center automation market, Goalis poised to unveil a major automation strategy in the VSE market as well.andO;&quot;We see the VSE market being affected by the same factors as the MVS market,&quot;Wetmore said.andM;Goal has the FAQS/VSE product line for message management and operationssupport.andP;  The Tower acquisition fills the tape and disk management piece ofthe VSE automation line.andP;  And the acquisition of Essential gives Goal thepotential to move the MVS report management software to VSE.andP;  &quot;We will doit,&quot; said Ater of the VSE port of Essential's product, which would help VSEusers save on printing costs, and provide a logical separation of reports.andM;&quot;We now have a comprenhensive VSE solution and 45 salesmen targeting VSE,&quot;Wetmore said.andP;  &quot;Only CA has the same breadth of product.&quot;andM;Steve Sasser, president of the Data Center Management division at Goal, is a10-year veteral of Dallas-based Uccel, where he once eyed Goal as anacquisition.andP;  &quot;Uccel was interested in VSE companies, but there was nointerest on Goal's part,&quot; Sasser said.andP;  Goal is much further along with theintegration of its VSE products than with its newly acquired MVS products,Sasser said.andM;For example, Goal's VSE line contains a Global Event Manager, which is acollection point for information from other VSE products.andP;  In the secondquarter, Goal plans to announce the Automated System Operation product linefor VSE, an enabling architecture for VSE data center operations.andP;  Goal alsowrote a Rexx compiler for VSE to bring the product line into SAA compliance.andM;&quot;This product will blow the socks off the VSE market this year,&quot; Sasserpredicted.andP;  &quot;We want to automate the VSE guy.andP;  We will help them save moneyon software and hardware from IBM--it's a business decision for them.andP;  It'sout 'termite' strategy for the VSE market.andP;  And our acquisitions of OPS/MVS,Tower and Essential will help us inour 'Godzilla' strategy for the high-endMVS market.&quot;andM;Goal will be watching IBM's VSE upgrade path closely.andP;  If IBM approachesone-half to three-quarters of MVS license fees with upgraded releases of vSE,users are likely to be unhappy.andP;  &quot;They don't need a data center that operatesat the speed of sound,&quot; Wetmore said of the VSE community.andP;  A clone VSEoperating system, DOS/MVT, is available from Software Pursuits, SanFrancisco.andM;Goal's lesser known product line is utility tools.andP;  Vsam tools contributedsome 25% of revenue last year, Ater said.andP;  Products include the Faverback-up/restore system and the Vsamaid Vsam tuning tool.andM;Goal's presence in the MVS market traces to the Phoenix product.andP;  Goal hiredthe developer of the Software, an Ohio State University student who convincedGoal to acquire its marketing rights and maintain it for the university.andO;Today, the training business represents 25% of Goal's revenue.andP;  Some 300 userof Goal's Phoenix computer-based training tool and Preference computer-basedreference tool attended an April meeting in Chicago.andP;  Still, &quot;Trainingbudgets are the first to get axed, so iths a difficult market,&quot; Rutherfordsaid.andM;The training software market is not projected to grow as fast as systemssoftware revenue.andP;  Poyner projects training revenue to grow at 10%-15%, andsystems software revenue to grow at over 30%.andM;While the synergy of the software product line and training products linesmay not be apparent, Wetmore says over time it will become more so.andP;  &quot;Bothproduct lines are business solutions which make economic sense.andP;  The CIO isthe place where both of our products lines are eventually directed.andP;  But weare not there yet,&quot; he said.andM;Goal paid a high price for what it sees as a golden opportunity--the MVS datacenter automation market.andM;For MVS Software, which has some 100 installations of OPS/MVS, Goal paid fourtimes trailing 12 months revenue, or $27.5 million.andP;  &quot;We expect 30% returnovr a five-year period,&quot; Kelley said.andP;  Wetmore said, &quot;You don't get a RollsRoyce for a Chevy price.andP;  The price doesn't bother me.andP;  OPS/MVS is anumbrella for the rest of our product line.andP;  It's the linchpin in theexecution of our automated operations strategy.&quot;andM;For MVS automated operations, Goal now has OPS/MVS for message management,FAQS/MVS for operations productivity, Express Delivery for report management,Jobtrac for job scheduling and Epic (currently in beta) for tape management.andM;Jeff Schulman of the Gartner Group, Stamford, Conn., long a fan of MVSSoftware, predicts that Goal's acquisitions have propelled the company intothe &quot;major league&quot; of data center management vendors.andP;  &quot;We believe Goal maybecome one of the few with credibility in the systems software market,&quot;Schulman stated.andM;The product integration work will fall primarily to Ater and his staff.andP;  &quot;IBMdid us a favor with the SAA Common user Access guidelines,&quot; Ater said.andP;  Theprocess involves meeting with the key developers to work out a design toaccomplish the integration objective, he said.andM;When companies are being examined for acquisition, the ability of theirsoftware to be integrated with Goal's is a major consideration, Sasser said.andM;Even though integration is a priority for Goal, &quot;We are not droppingeverything else,&quot; Ater said.andP;  Asked if he fears that Goal's interest in theMVS market could mean fewer resources devoted to the VSE products, OlanMills' Clark said he sees no evidence of it.andM;Besides product intergration, now Goal must be more concerned with ComputerAssociates, Legent, IBM and other major systems software firms as competitor.andO;Schulman noted that CA and Legent both have advantages in distribution andsales.andP;  In the data center automation market, Schulman stated, &quot;Thecompetition will be bloody and intense.&quot;andM;Integrating key people in the acquired companies is the immediate challegefacing Goal.andP;  &quot;It's too early to tell how Goal is going to handle this,&quot;Schulman said.andP;  &quot;They can't drop the ball with any products, especiallyOPS/MVS.andP;  It's been a while since we've seen a new function in OPS/MVS.&quot; henoted, while Legent's Automate/MVS was recently upgraded to release 3.0.andM;Arrangements to keep the key MVS Software developers were still being workedout in April.andP;  &quot;The tendency might be to take the money and run,&quot; Schulmancommented.andM;MANAGEMENT EYES $100 MILLIONandM;How big can Goal get?andP;  Goal's executives are projecting fiscal year 1991revenues of $115-$120 million and profits of $.90/share.andM;The expected entry of IBM's System Managed Architecture, the data centerparallel to AD/Cycle, is not viewed as a competitive threat.andP;  But little isknown about what markets IBM may try to claim for itself within SMA.andM;With Goal growing at a 30{ clip while mainframe growth has been essentiallyflat, it seems that the firm's growth has come at the expense of competitors.andO;But the company does not intend to try to take out established competitiveproducts, such as Candle Corp.'s Omegamon performance monitor, and replacethem with Goal products.andP;  Instead, the company hopes to win a fair percentageof sites that convert from VSE t MVS.andM;&quot;We estimate there are 400 conversions a year from VSE to MVS,&quot; Schulmansaid.andP;  &quot;Goal has the ability to try and deliver a relatively painlessmigration from VSE to MVS.&quot;andM;Another future area for growth is the DB2 tools market.andP;  The Insight/DB2product Goal acquired with Data Base Utility Group of Seattle is the firr'sonly DB2 tool.andM;But for the near term, Goal is concentrating on integrating its acquisitions.andO;The firm now has developers in Columbus, Seattle, Houston, Dallas and LosAngeles.andP;  &quot;If we were to stumble and not deliver,&quot; Wetmore said, &quot;we wouldhave won the battle and lost the war.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
