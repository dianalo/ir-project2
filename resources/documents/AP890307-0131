The president, a lifetime member of the National RifleAssociation, said he directed William Bennett, his nominee for drugpolicy coordinator, to look into what can be done about theproliferation of semiautomatics on city streets.   Although he said previously that he opposed banning such weapons,Bush said Tuesday that he assigned Bennett to ``work the problem,''and told him:   ``I'm not so rigid that if you come to me with a sensible answerthat takes care of the concerns that I've felt over the years, I'lltake a hard look at it, and I'll work with you to that end.''   Bush said he spoke to Bennett after the nominee was quoted astaking a position opposite the president in saying he would consideroutlawing the weapons as a way to cut down on drug-related violence.   The semiautomatic AK-47 guns have provoked increasing publicoutcry with an escalating number of shootings involving gangs andinnocent bystanders.   Bush said he wants to find ``what can be worked out with finalityon AK-47s ... and still do what's right by the legitimate sportsman.I'd love to find an answer to that.''   The NRA has been active in opposing any semiautomatic-ban effortson Capitol Hill on the grounds that such limits would also affecthunting rifles.   Asked what he would tell family members of those who were killedand maimed by such weapons _ which inflict wounds doctors learned totreat in the Vietnam War _ Bush said, ``I say the same thing I sayto a person whose family has been maimed by a pistol or an explosivecharge or whatever else it might be _ a fire _ this is bad, and wehave to stop the scourge of drugs.''   But he added in terms of curbing semiautomatics, ``It isn't aseasy as it seems to those who are understandably crying out, `dosomething. Do something.'''   While Bush voiced concern about the terror waged bysemiautomatics, his comments coupled with his association with theNRA left gun-control activists skeptical.   ``He hasn't supported anything,'' such as a waiting period to buysuch guns instead of the current over-the-counter purchase, saidStay Onders, public relations spokeswoman for the National Coalitionto Ban Handguns. ``I think he got some backlash from his originalstatement,'' opposing a ban on semiautomatics, she added. ``I thinkhe's just trying to make himself seem a little moderate.''   Efforts to outlaw semiautomatics have taken a higher profilesince mid-January when a gunman took a Chinese-made AK-47 into aschoolyard in Stockton, Calif., and shot 35 people, including fivechildren who were fatally shot.   Bush held his news conference on short notice after a winterstorm caused postponement of a planned trip to Pennsylvania andDelaware that was to have focused on an anti-drug message.   On Monday, Bush told a Veterans of Foreign Wars audience that``the notion that America is a nation at peace is only partly true,as long as the violence and destructive power of drugs assault ourcommunities.''   He pledged to ``mobilize all our resources'' to combat drug abuse.   Bush has asked Congress for $5.5 billion for the battle againstdrugs, with much of the money going to law enforcement.</TEXT></DOC>
