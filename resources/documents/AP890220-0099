The strike, called by the PLO-linked United National Leadershipof the Uprising, kept businesses and transportion shut down in theoccupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. It was to continue Tuesday.   The violence was part of the Palestinian uprising against Israelirule of the occupied lands. Since the revolt began 14 months ago,383 Palestinians and 15 Israelis have been killed.   On Monday, the army declared Nablus, the West Bank's largestcity, a closed military zone and erected roadblocks at fourentrances.   Troops stopped dozens of Arab-owned cars in the city and orderedthe drivers to remove outlawed Palestinian flags and pro-PalestineLiberation Organization graffiti, an Arab reporter said.   Officials at Al Ittihad Hospital in Nablus said they treated fourPalestinians wounded in stone-throwing clashes with troops inseveral West Bank areas. The wounded included a 14-year-old boy fromJenin who was shot in the stomach, the doctors said.   In Jenin, troops bulldozed the house of a resident accused ofthrowing three firebombs at an Israeli army vehicle, an armyofficial said. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,said he did not know if anyone was injured in the attack.   The army sealed the homes of three suspected firebomb throwers inthe villages of Hawwara and Dahiat al Barrad near Jerusalem, theofficial said.   The punishment of destroying or sealing homes usually is carriedout before a suspect is charged, a practice the United States andinternational human rights groups say denies Palestinians dueprocess of law.   In the occupied Gaza Strip, the army imposed curfews thatconfined about 70,000 Palestinians to their homes.   In clashes in the Shati and Deir Al Balah refugee camps troopsshot and wounded 16 Palestinians. They included 12-year-old Alad AbuNahel, a Shati resident shot in the eye who is in danger of losingit, and a seven-year-old shot in the leg, hospital officials said.   The army confirmed three wounded in the West Bank and said it waschecking other casualties.   In Arab east Jerusalem, Israeli authorities ordered twoPalestinian journalists and an Arab writer held for six monthswithout trial, Arab reports said. The three were identified as NabilJoulani, Abdul Latif Gaith and Adnan Shalaldah.   The move appeared to be part of an Israeli campaign against Arabjournalists that began Saturday with the six-month detention ofanother journalist, Samaan Khouri.   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens flew to Cairo for meetings onpossible Middle East peace talks Monday with Egyptian PresidentHosni Mubarak and Wednesday with his Soviet counterpart, EduardShevardnadze.   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Monday he hopes the talks leadto a breakthrough in stagnated relations with Egypt and anormalization of Israeli-Soviet ties.   ``Maybe we're entering a more intensive stage in the Middle Eastpeace process,'' Shamir said on Israel TV's Arabic-language program.``I'm not convinced in that, but I would like to hope that themeeting with President Mubarak ... would renew something inrelations between us and Egypt, and would express some specialEgyptian activity regarding the peace process.''   ``Maybe this meeting foretells some breakthrough,'' he added.   Of Arens' scheduled meeting with Shevardnadze, Shamir said, ``Ithink that with every meeting we are coming closer to anormalization'' of the relations Moscow broke after the 1967Arab-Israeli war.   Renewal of ties is an Israeli condition for a Soviet role in thepeace process.</TEXT></DOC>
