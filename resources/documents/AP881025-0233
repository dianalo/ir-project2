ROSENBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The fevered pitch of Wall Street's bidding forgiant food companies could go even higher following Kohlberg KravisRoberts andamp; Co.'s record $20.28 billion offer for RJR Nabisco Inc.   Kohlberg Kravis' announcement Monday of a $90-a-share leveragedbuyout offer for RJR Nabisco came four days after Nabisco'smanagement said it might offer $17 billion, or $75 a share, to buythe company from stockholders.   ``Our offer is a better one,'' stated Henry Kravis, a partner inthe New York-based investment firm.   Securities analysts said the Kohlberg Kravis offer was more inline with Nabisco's worth than the proposal presented bymanagement, and say higher offers still may emerge.   ``There's a possibility this will be the final bid, but it couldgo as high as $100,'' said Jay Nelson, an analyst with BrownBrothers Harriman Inc. ``It's feasible, but not at all certain.''   New York-based Kohlberg Kravis said it would offer $90 a sharein cash for about 87 percent of RJR Nabisco's 225.3 millionoutstanding shares, and would exchange securities valued at thesame amount for the rest of the company's stock.   The offer was was conditioned on support from Nabisco's board.   The investment firm, known for its big, successful leveragedbuyout bids, said it would begin the tender offer formally laterthis week. At more than $20 billion, the offer would surpass thebiggest corporate acquisition of any type, the $13.4 billionpurchase of Gulf Corp. by Chevron Corp. in 1984.   There was no comment from RJR Nabisco or the managers who onThursday announced they were considering a $75-a-share cash bid forthe food and tobacco company.   On Wall Street, investors reacted enthusastically to KohlbergKravis's offer. Nabisco stock shot up $7.25 a share to $84 in NewYork Stock Exchange composite trading.   Ronald B. Morrow, who tracks Nabisco for the investment firmSmith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., said he doubted the managementgroup, led by Nabisco President F. Ross Johnson, would be disturbedby the Kohlberg Kravis bid.   ``They were definitely inviting offers,'' he said.   Clinton Mayer, an analyst with Bear Stearns andamp; Co. Inc., said ofthe Johnson group, ``They're in a no-lose situation.''   ``I think if they could buy at $75, they would have beenhappy,'' Mayer said, but also said ``they would be very happy ifsomeone else bid a higher price.''   Kohlberg Kravis had been expected to enter the whirlwind of bidsfor food companies that began Oct. 4 with a $5.23 billion bid forPillsbury Co. by Grand Metropolitan PLC, a British company.   But many thought the investment firm was considering a bid forKraft Inc., which late Sunday rejected a more than $11 billion bidfrom Philip Morris Cos. Inc. and announced its own $13.59 billionrecapitalization plan.   A successful buyout of Nabisco would be the biggest leveragedbuyout of an American corporation by far. The largest LBO wasKohlberg Kravis' $6.1 billion buyout of Beatrice Cos. in 1986.   In a leveraged buyout, a company is acquired mainly withborrowed funds that are repaid either with company revenue or moneyraised by selling parts of the operation.   Henry Kravis, a partner in the investment firm, said in astatement his company had raised an equity pool of $5.6 billion forbuyouts. Experts say that amount could be used to ``leverage'' asmuch as $40 billion in loans for acquisitions.   Kohlberg Kravis also is leading a group attempting to acquirethe publishing giant Macmillan Inc. for $2.5 billion. Britishpublisher Robert Maxwell, who also seeks to buy Macmillan, isfighting that bid in a Delaware court.   The investment firm recently withdrew a $5.03 billion bid forsupermarket operator Kroger Co. after Kroger's board rejected theoffer in favor of a financial restructuring.   Past Kohlberg leveraged buyouts also include the 1986 purchaseof Safeway Stores Inc. for $4.2 billion, the 1987 buyout ofOwens-Illinois Inc. for $3.7 billion, the purchase of StorerCommunications Inc. for $2.5 billion in 1985, and the buyout ofStop andamp; Shop Cos. earlier this year for $1.23 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
