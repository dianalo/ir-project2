The June 27 blaze killed a woman, left hundreds homeless andwrought more than $250 million in damages in an area north of SantaBarbara.   In the Los Angeles suburb of Glendale, an 350-acre arson firedestroyed 46 homes and damaged 26 others the same day. Damage therewas estimated between $30 million and $40 million.   ``We were wondering if we really still had anything tocelebrate,'' said Peter Georgi, an insurance agent who is directingSanta Barbara's Old Spanish Days fiesta, the biggest tourism eventof the year for the city of 300,000. The five-day celebrationbegins Wednesday.   Georgi, who had 10 clients lose homes in the blaze, said heasked them what they thought as he handed out claim checks. ``Theysaid to go ahead, that they didn't have anything else to lookforward to,'' he said in an interview.   Red, green and yellow flags already line the fiesta's mainthoroughfare. Food booths and stages are going up for the 100,000people organizers hope will attend.   The parade starting the fiesta will be dedicated to Andrea LangGurka, 37, who died as she tried to flee flames roaring toward hercanyon home. Those who were left homeless also will be remembered.   Mrs. Gurka's husband, Michael, said he wants to help educatepeople about fire safety and raise $100,000 to disseminateinformation on such things as fire-retardant buildings andprevention of post-fire soil erosion.   ``I'm trying to find some meaning in this,'' Gurka, 36, toldviewers of a July 6 fire-relief telethon. ``If we can educatepeople about fire, then potential human life won't be lost.''   In the fire-ravaged neighborhoods, surviving homes topped withmanufactured roofing materials stand stark amid the ruins. New cityand county ordinances require shingles of clay, metal or cement.Wood shake roofs, which exploded in flames the night of the fire,are now banned.   Santa Barbara County says 441 single family homes were touchedby the blaze, and 427 were destroyed along with 98 individualapartments. But the Red Cross, basing its figure on the number offamilies who have registered with the disaster agency, estimates630 residences were destroyed.   The county, strapped by a $4 million deficit before the fire,lost $5 million in public buildings and 20 patrol cars.   Tourism has dropped by 10 percent to 15 percent, said spokesmanMichael Forbes of the city's Tourism and Information Bureau. Butthe area's 4,700 hotel and motel rooms are booked solid for thefestival, he said.   ``What people don't realize is that the city of Santa Barbaradid not burn down,'' he said. ``All of the attractions, the hotels,the shops, the beaches, all the reasons why people come SantaBarbara _ none of that was affected.''</TEXT></DOC>
