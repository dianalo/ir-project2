Prosper Avril's militarygovernment worked today to restore its authority after crushing arevolt by army units in two days of fierce fighting.   The government appeared to be firmly in control after therebellion, which followed a failed military coup eight days ago.Shops, offices and schools were open and traffic was back to normalin Port-au-Prince, this Caribbean nation's capital of 1 millionpeople.   Government communiques released late Sunday lifted newscensorship and eased an overnight curfew.   Only sporadic shooting was heard in Port-au-Prince overnight,and one body was found in a street early today.   The government released no information about the number ofcasualties during the weeklong revolt or the fate of rebelscaptured during the final assault Saturday by Avril's PresidentialGuard on the mutineers' stronghold.   However, Roman Catholic Radio Soleil said today that 30 soldiers_ 25 rebels and five loyalists _ and four civilians were killedFriday and Saturday in fighting with cannons, mortars, grenades,rifles and machine guns. A Haitian doctor speaking on condition ofanonymity said at least 15 soldiers of the Presidential Guard werewounded but he had no report on injured rebels.   A military communique issued at 5:15 p.m. Saturday said loyaltroops had seized the Dessalines Barracks compound adjoining theNational Palace and most of the rebels were captured but a few fled.   It blamed the revolt, which began April 2 with a failed coupattempt, on people it said were opposed to the government's ``vastcampaign against drug trafficking, contraband and corruption.''   Four ranking officers were accused of plotting the coup andthree were deported last week to the United States. The fourth,Col. Guy Francois, commander of the Dessalines Barracks, receivedasylum in the Vatican Embassy, according to Radio Soleil.   Avril's seven-month-old government has been under pressure fromthe United States to act against narcotics trafficking and thosemilitary officers reportedly profiting from it.   Washington has made action against the trafficking a conditionfor restoring $70 million in aid that was suspended in November1987 after bands of thugs killed 34 people and brought thecancellation of elections.   The balloting would have been Haiti's first free elections in 30years. It was scheduled after dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier fled toFrance in February 1986 during violent demonstrations.   Avril was installed as president in September after a coup ledby non-commissioned officers and established the island's fourthgovernment since 1968. He has promised democratic elections.   Two of the army's strongest military units, the DessalinesBarracks with 750 troopers and the Leopards Battalion on theoutskirts of the capital with 400 soldiers, rebelled after Avrildeported three alleged leaders of the attempted April 2 coup: Lt.Col. Himmler Rebu, commander of the Leopards; Presidential Guardscommander Col. Philippe Biamby and Col. Leonce Qualo of armyheadquarters.   But the Presidential Guards, which has 1,100 soldiers and is thelargest unit in Haiti's 7,000-man army, remained loyal.   Soldiers of the Leopards Battalion revolted after the failedcoup, demanding the release of their commander. There have beenconflicting reports about the death toll in fighting earlier in theweek with at least six Leopards killed.   U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Susan Clyde said Sunday the UnitedStates had donated $25,000 to the Haitian Red Cross for medicalassistance.</TEXT></DOC>
