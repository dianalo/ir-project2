The presidential patienceappeared to be wearing thin.   Sure he was worried about the drug lords in Colombia and thecivil war in Lebanon. But the other thing bugging Bush as he relaxedon the coast of Maine was why the heck couldn't he catch a fish.   Despite daily excursions in his speedboat Fidelity _ sometimestwice daily _ to ply the ocean off his seaside home, the presidentfailed to reel one in.   He tried all kinds of lures and a variety of fishing partners _from grandchildren to visiting dignitaries _ but still came up withan empty line.   He canceled an afternoon of golf Sunday in favor of a fishingjaunt, and on Monday morning decided to forgo his 6:30 a.m. jog totry again.   On the advice of longtime fishing buddy Bob Boilard the presidenteven ordered the Secret Service to keep extraneous boats, includingthe small flotilla of press chase boats, 500 feet away on the theorythat the vessels might be scaring off the fish.   Still no luck.   Bush tried not to show dismay, and Barbara Bush claimed thepresident wasn't bothered a bit. But there were signs it was gettingto be something of a sore subject.   ``The fishing's been lousy,'' he confided to reporters at the endof the first fishless week. ``I fish every single day and haven'tgot one.''   Eventually there were inklings of a Hemingwayesque obsession, ashe talked of having a ``rendezvous with bluefish.'' He laid down adecree: ``I guarantee there will be fish caught.''   When he learned that an 18-pounder was caught off one of the TVcrew boats tailing Fidelity, he could barely contain his envy.   ``Eighteen pound bluefish?'' he repeated several times. ``Outthere with us? There's no justice here. That's just not fair.''   Meanwhile, word was spreading fast about the fishless vacation.   The Portland Press Herald came out with a front page graphiccalled Fish Watch, featuring a picture of a circled fish with a linedrawn across it and the statistics on how many days Bush has fishedwithout a catch.   When Bush piloted his boat into town one day, a local fishermangave him a large fish, and Bush grudgingly agreed with the presscorps that this seemed the only way he could hook one.   Evangelist Billy Graham, Bush's weekend house guest, told a localchurch congregation the president took him along on a fishing tripas a Jonah, a reference to the biblical figure who was swallowed bya whale.   The president laughed and nodded when a reporter asked if hewould have Graham bless his fishing rods.   Bush has previously espoused a philosophical viewpoint onfish-free vacations, saying the fun was more in the fishing than thecatching.   But this trip, the situation seemed a bit much to take.   By Monday both the president and his staff were trying to put thebest face on his bad luck streak.   That morning presidential photographer David Valdez caught sixfish on the president's boat and National Security Adviser BrentScowcroft caught one that he described by extending his hands abouttwo feet.   White House spokesman Bruce Zanca later said diplomatically,``Under the president's careful tutelage, the fishing trip wassuccessful ... The fish were caught under his strong leadership.''   When reporters came upon him later at the golf course, thepresident also took the cheery tack.   ``We did it today,'' he said.   But when asked if ``we'' meant he too had caught a fish, hequipped, ``I was so busy trying to make General Scowcroft feel athome there ... we did well today.''   By the time Scowcroft finished beating his boss at golf, a gameBush has vowed to improve on this vacation, Bush was directing allquestions about golf and fishing to him.   ``Brent, they want to talk to you about this. I'm too grumpy,''he said before darting off in his golf cart.</TEXT></DOC>
