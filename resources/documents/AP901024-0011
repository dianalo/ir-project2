The enemy, for many, is a clock that moves too slowly.   ``People keep telling lies that morale is high,'' said Spec.Chris Hernandez of San Antonio, Texas, playing cards with friendswho nodded assent. ``They're only fooling themselves. Morale islow.''   A sampling of the 200,000 soldiers and Marines deployed underOperation Desert Shield to confront Iraq suggests a classicmilitary malaise: Troops, with no idea of when new orders mightcome, want to get back to their lives.   Some have been in the blistering northeastern Saudi desert formore than two months preparing for a battle that might never come.   The desert weather is cooling down, but the sand remains,fouling equipment, jamming weapons and fraying tempers.   But many are still anxious to fight. Marine Sgt. MarcoRodriguez, a 23-year-old aircraft mechanic from Santa Barbara,Calif., left no doubt.   ``I'll come home in one of two ways, the big parade or in a bodybag,'' he said. ``I prefer the former, but I'll take the latter.''   Lack of enthusiasm, however, seemed more common.   Field commanders like Lt. Col. Stephen Lutz, of the 3rdBattalion, 41st Field Artillery - the Battle Kings - scroungevideos, books, volleyballs and games to help their troops get by.   ``We're thinking about this every day,'' Lutz said of growingmorale problems. ``We try to provide some relief and outlet for thesoldiers.''   Sgts. Steve Coles, of Pittsburgh, Pa., and Ty McWhorter ofWichita Falls, Texas, weren't convinced by the efforts. They spentlast Christmas in Panama on Operation Just Cause. This year, theyfigure, they'll miss out again.   ``All the goodies, we don't want them,'' Coles said. ``We onlywant one thing: to go home. And that's speaking on behalf ofeveryone.''   McWhorter nodded gravely. His daughter was born 17 months ago,just before desert training. Then came Panama and more deserttraining. And then Saudi Arabia.   Like most others, Coles and McWhorter acknowledged Desert Shieldwas made up of volunteer service people. Like many others, however,they said that if they weren't going to fight, they had no businesssitting around in the desert.   Spec. Darnell Thompson of Akron, Ohio, said his daughter wasborn in early October, and the news - from the Red Cross - took 10days to reach him. He had been due for discharge soon but emergencyorders extended his stay for six months.   ``We're not prisoners and shouldn't be held against our will,''he said.   Four soldiers playing cards broke in to condemn the long,uncertain wait.   William Curtis, 22, of Kelso, Wash., was barechested against theheat, revealing a snarling tiger tattooed on his right shoulder. Onthe left was a heart with the names of his three children. A fourthchild is due anytime.   ``If my wife's going to read this, tell her I love her,'' hesaid.   ``My question is why are we here?'' said Spec. Anthony Zippererof Ruskin, Fla. ``Kuwait's such a little country. It's not ademocracy. If this isn't for oil, why are we fighting?''   He laughed and added: ``I won't tell you what I really feel.I've only said what I can get away with.''   Another shouted: ``I don't see why I should fight forconstitutional rights that are denied to me.''   The reporter, on an escorted tour, had to move on before hecould get an elaboration.   Morale is a sensitive question. After grousing 24th Divisionsoldiers were quoted in the New York Times, the commanding generalrestricted access to individual reporters.   ``One man insulted the president,'' an information officer saidon condition of anonymity. He referred to a remark that PresidentBush should come out and drink hot water with the troops to seethings up close.   Such remarks, however, were common, not only in the 24th butalso among the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force and elsewhere amongthe U.S. forces.   Sgt. Christopher Paugh, 28, a Marine aircraft mechanic fromPhiladelphia, wondered why troops couldn't have a cold beer.Someone said U.S. forces had to be careful not to upset the Saudis,for whom alcohol is forbidden by Islam.   Paugh retorted: ``Hey, if they don't want us on their side, theycan fight their own damned holy wars on their own land bythemselves. We'll go home.''   Senior army field officers blame the morale problem onuncertainty. In Vietnam, a tour of duty was fixed at 13 months. InKorea, troops had a calendar for marking off the days.   Operation Desert Shield, deployed in haste after Iraq invadedKuwait Aug. 2, is undefined. Rumors fly: one-year tours, or sixmonths, or 18 months, or war any day.   Some soldiers fault their comrades for grousing about a job theyvolunteered for, with risks they agreed to take.   ``It's part of the army,'' Lutz said. ``I was away when my sonwas born, too. No one likes that part, but it is our job.''   For the majority who grumble but do their best to adjust, smallcomforts appear by the day.   Marines of the 311 Combat Support Wing, based in Yuma, Ariz.,built a weight room from scrap wood and iron. A poster pinned tothe camouflage netting reads: ``Body by Saudi.''   On a jeep outside, a driver decorated his unneeded defrostervent with a photo of his wife, an American flag and a Bart Simpsondoll.   For Darin Gallow, 25, of Lake Charles, La., playing pickupbasketball by himself with a locket photo of Darin Jr. around hisneck, the luxury of letters from home makes the difference.   Quiet plans are afoot for rest and recreation trips. Some menand women take two-day breaks at a resort camp run by Aramco, thegiant U.S.-Saudi oil company.   At the Battle Kings' club, the small library is limited. Amongthe weighty tomes of military biographies and memoirs is awell-thumbed paperback change of pace: ``Dante's Inferno.''</TEXT></DOC>
