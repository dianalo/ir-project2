Clarke's nomination for a secondfive-year term as comptroller of the currency faces troublebecause he has united those who think he has been too lax inhis regulation of banks with those who think he's been tootough.   Banking experts worry that the criticism Mr. Clarke willface from opponents who want to make him a scapegoat for thecurrent wave of bank failures will complicate efforts toencourage bank examiners to lighten up so that banks will bemore willing to make loans as the economy struggles torecover.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Congress is sending out some very contradictory signals,&quot;says William Isaac, a Washington bank consultant who waschairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. &quot;They'rewringing their hands about the credit crunch, yet theycontinue to beat up on bank examiners for being too lax. Inthis climate, you can't blame examiners for beingextraordinarily cautious.&quot;   Sen. Donald Riegle (D., Mich.), chairman of the SenateBanking Committee, charges that there has been &quot;a seriousbreakdown in the regulatory process&quot; during Mr. Clarke'stenure. He intends to grill Mr. Clarke on topics ranging fromhis regulatory record to his personal investments whenconfirmation hearings begin Thursday.   The extensive personal investments of Mr. Clarke, amulti-millionaire former Texas banking lawyer, have emergedas an issue in his reconfirmation hearings. Yesterday, Mr.Clarke disclosed in response to questions from Mr. Rieglethat he had discussed regulatory matters with two officers ofFarm and Home Savings, an institution from which he has anoutstanding loan of $1.33 million. The men, Daniel Arnold andJoe Lynch, were also participants with Mr. Clarke ininvestment ventures.   He said that both men had approached him last year todiscuss a dispute involving Mr. Lynch and the FDIC. Ascomptroller of the currency, Mr. Clarke is a member of theboard of the FDIC. Mr. Clarke said in his written responsesto Sen. Riegle that he said &quot;it would be inappropriate&quot; forhim to be involved. In addition, he said that he and otherofficials of his office had met with Mr. Arnold in the 1980swhen Mr. Arnold was president of First City Bancorp. ofTexas, a troubled Houston bank, to discuss recapitalizationstrategies.   Ethics officers at the Treasury and the Office ofGovernment Ethics have ruled that Mr. Clarke didn't violateany rules or regulations in his personal financial dealings,but the new revelations of regulatory discussions with oldTexas friends with an institution that lent him money is sureto become an issue at his hearings.   Committee Democrats may not be able to build a strongenough case to defeat Mr. Clarke, especially in the face ofthe defense the Bush administration is preparing for itsnominee. But a public drubbing of Mr. Clarke, whose officeregulates 3,900 federally chartered banks, could causeexaminers to be more vigilant, some bankers fear.   Individual examiners are &quot;never criticized for being tootough or overly prudent,&quot; notes Paul Homan, chairman of FirstFlorida Banks Inc. in Tampa and a former assistant to Mr.Clarke. &quot;They're always criticized for being too lax if abank fails.&quot;   The crux of the case against Mr. Clarke is that he hasflip-flopped between loose and rigid regulation. Early in histerm, Mr. Clarke was &quot;asleep at the switch,&quot; says Sen.Alphonse D'Amato (R., N.Y.). As evidence, he cites a GeneralAccounting Office report alleging lapses in the comptroller'ssupervision of the Bank of New England, which failed inJanuary. But now Sen. D'Amato blames the comptroller for&quot;over-regulatory zeal&quot; and says businesses are sufferingbecause &quot;credit lines are being called in because ofregulatory requirements.&quot;   During the hearings, Sen. Riegle plans to focus on thecomptroller's enforcement record in an attempt to make thecase that Mr. Clarke didn't adequately police problem bankswhile bank failures were rising. Total enforcement actionsdeclined sharply from 624 in 1986, Mr. Clarke's first fullyear, to 316 in 1988 before rising again to 559 last year.   Mr. Clarke concedes that he has made mistakes, but he willhighlight his efforts to fit regulation to particularlydifficult economic conditions in the 1980s -- the oil pricecollapse in Texas, where more banks have failed than anywhereelse, and the real estate bust in New England. &quot;Banks thatare exposed to local economies are going to suffer a greatdeal when the economies in which they lend turn downward,&quot; hesaid in a speech to a banking group yesterday.   Some bankers, including members of the Independent BankersAssociation, which represents community banks, are urging thecommittee to reconfirm Mr. Clarke, whose nomination has beenpending since last December.   Terry Murray, chairman of Fleet/Norstar Financial GroupInc., New England's dominant bank, says further delay &quot;willonly add to the growing public perception that there is alack of consistent and responsible regulatory oversight ofour nation's financial institutions.&quot;   In a letter to committee members, Mr. Murray said Mr.Clarke &quot;has made a good-faith effort to adjust his regulatorypolicies and practices to adapt to changing conditions,&quot; buthe complained that &quot;his policy decisions aren't always beingcorrectly interpreted and implemented, particularly by bankexaminers in the field.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
