Operating proceduresfor downpower and loss of forced circulation are used for demonstration.Human-factors analysis is performed on generic emergency operating proceduresfor three strategies of control; manual, semi-automatic and automatic,using standard emergency operating procedures. Such preliminary analysisshows that automation of procedures is feasible provided that fault-tolerantsoftware and hardware become available for design of the controllers.Recommendations are provided for tests to substantiate the promise ofenhancement of plant safety. Adequate design of operating proceduresthrough automation may alleviate several major operational problems ofnuclear power plants. Also, automation of procedures is necessary forpartial or overall automatic control of plants. Fully automatic operationsare needed for space applications while supervised automation of land-basedand offshore plants may become the thrust of new generation of nulcearpower plants.</TEXT></DOC>
