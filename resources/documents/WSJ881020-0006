Wilson agreed last Saturday to be acquired by Doskocil for $14.50 a share after a long and bitter fight.    Doskocil said the new board is expected to meet this morning and elect Larry Doskocil, Doskocil's chairman and chief executive officer, as Wilson's chairman; and David Smoak, Doskocil's senior vice president and chief financial officer, as president and chief executive of Wilson.    Doskocil said it will purchase 8.1 million Wilson shares under the tender offer that expired last Friday, more than originally estimated. Those shares would give it about 89% of Wilson's shares, including the 9.6% stake that it already owned.    Wilson is an Oklahoma City pork processor and producer. </TEXT></DOC>
