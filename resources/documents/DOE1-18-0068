The distributions of these hydrocarbons are interpreted relativeto possible sources and processes. The hydrocarbons appear to be mixturesof primary and recycled material from marine and terrigenous sources.The n-alkanes are most abundant and are characterized by two distinctpopulations, one of probably marine origin and the other likely fromterrigenous, vascular plant sources. Because the continent of Antarcticatoday is devoid of higher plants, the plant-derived hydrocarbons in theseoffshore sediments probably came from wind-blow material and recycledAntarctic sediment that contains land-plant remains from an earlier periodof time. Isoprenoid hydrocarbons are partially recycled and mainly ofmarine origin; the dominance of pristane over phytane suggests oxic paleoenvironmentalconditions. Both modern and ancient triterpanes and steranes are present,and the distribution of these indicates a mixture of primary and recycledbacterial, algal and possible higher-plant materials. Although the sampledsediments were deposited during the Quaternary, they apparently containa significant component of hydrocarbons of pre-Quaternary age.</TEXT></DOC>
