Although standard contrast angiography has been consideredthe diagnostic study of choice to identify pseudoaneurysms, isotope angiographyhas been described as an alternative method. In this study, we examinedthe role of /sup 99m/Tc-tagged red blood cell scans in the diagnosisof traumatic pseudoaneurysm. Forty patients underwent scans; 25 scanswere reported as abnormal and 15 as normal. There were no false-negativeresults; one scan had false-positive results (2.5%). The presence ofpseudoaneurysm among the patients with abnormal scans was verified atoperation in 23 of 25 patients. The one false-positive test was verifiedby ultrasound. All patients with normal scans were followed up for verification.Follow-up time ranged from 2 to 28 months. Radionuclide vascular flowstudy appears to give information similar to that of conventional angiography.With a series false-positive rate of 2.5%, the examination has a highspecificity. The /sup 99m/Tc-tagged red blood cell scan is a viable alternativeto conventional angiography for the diagnosis of traumatic pseudoaneurysmsand is associated with less radiation and morbidity.</TEXT></DOC>
