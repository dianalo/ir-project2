John Crum, senior vice president and chief financial officer, said there weren't any current talks in progress with candidate companies, but said &quot;we would hope within the next 12 months&quot; to make one or more acquisitions.    Second-quarter per-share net was $11.22 at the real estate and manufacturing concern, 69%-owned by Canadian investors William and Samuel Belzberg.    Net included a loss from continuing operations of $9.6 million in the latest quarter; a gain of $79.4 million, or $9.96 a share, related to the June sale of its Nutone and Yale Security subsidiaries; and a $21.7 million tax credit. In the year-earlier quarter, First City had a net loss of $6.1 million, including profit from discontinued operations of $3.5 million, or 41 cents a share.    Sales fell 11% to $33.8 million from $38 million in the 1986 quarter. Fully diluted per-share earnings in the latest quarter were $7.27, the company said.    William Belzberg, chairman, didn't specify what industries First City might be studying for acquisition, but said the purchase and breakup of Scovill &quot;confirms the soundness of this approach.&quot; He said First City has cash and liquid assets of more than $400 million available for further acquisitions.    Mr. Crum said Scovill's operations had produced a return of $108 million on the $125 million cash portion of First City's total $540 million purchase price for Stamford, Conn.-based Scovill. The Yale Security lock and electronic security-products business and the Nutone door chime and home-products concern, sold for $460 million to London-based Valor PLC, were the largest elements of First City's sell-off, which Mr. Crum said had been completed for a total of $677 million.    He said only one former Scovill company, a maker of apparel fasteners, &quot;is an operation that we are retaining.&quot;    For the six-month period, First City posted net of $106.2 million, or $11.61 a share, consisting of a $15.5 million loss from continuing operations, gains of $84.5 million related to discontinued operations, and the tax credit. The prior year's net loss of $13.9 million consisted of a $16.9 million loss from continuing operations and a gain of $3.1 from discontinued operations.    Fully diluted per-share earnings in the latest six months were $7.64. Sales fell 5% to $64.6 million from $68 million the prior period.    First City stock closed at $14.125, down 25 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday. </TEXT></DOC>
