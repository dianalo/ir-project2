He shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States. -- Article II, Section 2.    He shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed. -- Article II, Section 3.    The judicial Power of the United States shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. -- Article III, Section 1.    These words from the Constitution establish the illegitimacy of the &quot;special prosecutors&quot; Ollie North and Mike Deaver are challenging. A surprising source contributed a legal precedent in this matter last week. A special judicial panel set up by Congress to supervise the special prosecutors ruled that one of them was out of line when she tried to act entirely independent of the executive branch. The weight of the argument has suddenly shifted against those who wish to entrench the &quot;independent&quot; prosecutors inside the three-branch system.    The Constitution set up one executive, the president. He executes the laws, which Congress writes and the courts interpret. The Founders didn't want Congress to use vague laws to punish citizens who held unpopular beliefs. The 1978 Ethics in Government Act drove a tank through this wall between the branches. Congress required the executive to allow the creation of independent prosecutors whenever there's evidence of wrongdoing by White House personnel, and it created a three-judge panel to supervise the prosecutors.    In its decision last week, the panel of judges gave lip service to the constitutionality of the Act that empowered them, but ruled against Alexia Morrison. She is the special prosecutor appointed to investigate whether Justice Department officials misled Congress in a 1983 Environmental Protection Agency controversy. Edwin Meese agreed she could investigate former assistant attorney general Theodore Olson, who denies any wrongdoing. But members of Congress, by complaining loudly about the course of the investigation, pressured Ms. Morrison into a fishing expedition. She then cast her net to include two other former Justice officials. The judges said she can't do that without the approval of Mr. Meese, a member of the executive branch.    This won't help those who think the prosecutors are constitutional. They rest their case on a clause at the end of Article II, Section 2, after the president is given authority over &quot;all other Officers.&quot; The clause says, &quot;The Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.&quot;    Proponents must argue that special prosecutors are &quot;inferior Officers.&quot; Good luck. Once possible wrongdoers are identified by the attorney general, the ethics law grants the special prosecutors &quot;full power and independent authority to exercise all investigative and prosecutorial functions and powers of the Department of Justice, the attorney general, and any other officer or employee of the Department of Justice.&quot; They can't be removed from office by the executive without &quot;good cause,&quot; which is subject to court review.    The simple meaning of the &quot;inferior Officer&quot; clause was to let officials hire underlings without getting specific approval from Congress each time. The purpose of these words obviously was not to topple the scheme of separation of powers. Before he joined the D.C. Circuit, Robert Bork testified to the Senate that the proposed law was unconstitutional. &quot;The Framers intended to give Congress the power to vest in the courts the power to appoint 'inferior Officers' such as clerks, bailiffs and similar functionaries,&quot; not full-fledged prosecutors.    It seems to us that these prosecutors not only replace the attorney general -- himself an officer superior enough to warrant confirmation -- but indeed the president himself. Congressional passage of a bill to usurp this power by creating a new kind of prosecutor is comparable to the courts declaring war or the president granting certiorari. This is why, as we wrote here on March 12, &quot;independent prosecutor&quot; is a constitutional oxymoron.    Congress could, but probably won't, fix the law. The only necessary change is to make the prosecutor an executive-branch official. From Teapot Dome to Watergate, presidents appointed their own prosecutors outside the Justice Department to investigate executive-branch personnel.    Unless the Supreme Court invalidates the law before January, Congress won't be able to duck this issue. The ethics law has a sunset provision, so it will expire at the end of the year unless it's re-authorized. Assistant Attorney General John Bolton recently went before a Senate subcommittee to rehearse the constitutional arguments against re-authorization. Chairman Sen. Carl Levin (D., Mich.) didn't want to hear them. Sen. Levin said the &quot;Justice Department position plays into the hands&quot; of Messrs. North and Deaver.    Not necessarily. Note what happens if one of these men is convicted of something, then wins his challenge against the prosecutor. He would have an excellent claim of double jeopardy, thus escaping any prosecution. This might be the shock congressmen need to accept separation of powers. </TEXT></DOC>
