Whether debating Democratic front-runner Bill Clinton orfencing with reporters on network TV or simply taking hisexistential campaign from one chaotic event to the next, thefeisty Mr. Brown is getting the kind of attention he covets.</LP><TEXT>   The former California governor isn't going to win hisparty's nomination -- he knows that -- but he insists he'snot going to drop out of the race either. He's convincedhe'll finish second, behind Gov. Clinton, in today's Michiganprimary, and that he will go on to even better showings inIndiana, Connecticut and Wisconsin. He says he'll win theCalifornia primary on June 2.   But that's not what he's really up to. He thinks that he'son his way to forming an insurgent movement within theDemocratic Party that will keep him busy well beyond theNovember election.   &quot;I'm not going to go away,&quot; he says in an interview, ashis volunteer minivan driver careens down icy highways enroute to another rally featuring cheering college students.&quot;I'm going to keep working at it, like Ralph Nader or (JesseJackson's) Rainbow Coalition.&quot;   He's building this coalition with the help of hisnow-legendary 800 number. He estimates that 100,000 votershave called the 20 operators standing by to ask forinformation. Of these callers, about 20,000 have actuallymade cash contributions. Although he raised millions in heftycontributions in his last political incarnation, as partychairman in California, he says he won't take more than $100from anyone in this campaign.   He travels with a press secretary and with French-bornJacques Barzaghi, a kind of campaign symbol in his all-blackoutfit -- black beret, black leather jacket, black chinos,black boots. Mr. Barzaghi, who once served in the French armyand has four children from his marriages to three Americanwomen, has been with Mr. Brown for 20 years. No one is quitesure what his exact role is. &quot;I talk to him,&quot; says Mr. Brown.   &quot;When we ran for president before (in 1976 and 1980), itwas always boom, boom, boom, and then it was over,&quot; says Mr.Barzaghi. &quot;This is a real campaign.&quot; When Mr. Brown gives oneof his stem-winding speeches -- they often run for 50 minutes-- Mr. Barzaghi crouches on the floor in front of the podium.Sometimes even he gets enough, and he signals the &quot;cut&quot; sign,fingers sawing across his throat.   Mr. Brown's campaign reminds political veterans of a JesseJackson enterprise -- extemporaneous, highly personalized,sometimes inspired, sometimes demagogic, usually chaotic.   Every now and again, Mr. Brown decides to change hisschedule while his eight-seat aircraft is in the air. Aides-- volunteers for the most part -- and reporters and TV crewsfly in two or three other little planes; they typicallyarrive at rallies after Mr. Brown has finished speaking. Thecandidate usually sleeps in the homes of supporters who havebeen tracked down because they used the 800 number to call incontributions. Everyone else scrambles for accommodations.   Late last week, as the 53-year-old candidate was wooingMichigan auto workers by hitting hard on his opposition tofast-track legislation on a free-trade agreement with Mexico,he set out in a fleet of three little planes on a 600-mileflight to Marquette, a frozen outpost at the northern tip ofMichigan's Upper Peninsula. Even the folks in Marquettewondered a little what he was doing there.   To almost everyone's surprise, his campaign put togetheran effective TV ad last week. Mr. Brown was just as surprisedas everyone else: As it went on the air, he admitted hehadn't seen it. &quot;It just shows I can delegate authority,&quot; hesaid. He was pretty sure the commercial attacks his opponentsfor favoring the fast-track legislation. (It does.)   The campaign spent $150,000 to put the ad on the air, ahuge investment for this bargain-basement campaign. It showspictures of Arkansas Gov. Clinton and Mr. Brown's other majorDemocratic rival, former Sen. Paul Tsongas, along withPresident Bush, and it charges that they want to sendMichigan jobs to Mexico. &quot;Stop them,&quot; Mr. Brown says. &quot;KeepMichigan jobs in Michigan.&quot;   Who made the TV ad? &quot;Joe Trippi's wife,&quot; says Mr. Brown.Well, not exactly. Mr. Trippi, a veteran Washington-basedpolitical consultant, says a number of people got together asvolunteers and produced the ad. He says his wife, Katie, madethe &quot;buy&quot; with Michigan TV stations to put it on the air.   Mr. Brown works wonders with his campaign issues. Beforehe came to Michigan, he ran a campaign attacking &quot;specialinterests&quot; for corrupting U.S. politics with their big cashcontributions to members of Congress. He still talks aboutthat, and the timing is serendipitous: Much of the country istalking about how 355 members or former members of the Houseof Representatives kited checks at their own bank.   But here in Michigan he switched easily into another gear.With organized labor's choice, Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa, outof the race, Mr. Brown began working on voters' fears byattacking the trade agreement with Mexico. In his ad, he saysthe agreement &quot;could cost Michigan workers their jobs.&quot;Unemployment is high here -- 9% -- and auto workers have beenstunned by plant closings.   &quot;It's a job program for Mexico,&quot; Mr. Brown told atypically large and enthusiastic audience at the Universityof Michigan campus here in the heart of Buick country. &quot;Weneed a jobs program for America.&quot;   But it never seems to occur to Mr. Brown that the audiencehe is targeting is the United Auto Workers -- a union thathas long had its own special interests and pursued them withcampaign contributions to members of Congress as part of thevery system Mr. Brown says is corrupt. In the 1990 elections,the UAW's political action committee doled out $1.8 millionto Democratic congressional candidates.   Mr. Brown says this campaign, and the group he plans toput together after it's over, is aimed at recapturing theDemocratic Party for ordinary Americans.   But then there's Mr. Brown's proposal to replaceindividual and corporate income taxes, Social Security taxesand gasoline taxes with a flat-rate 13% income tax, withdeductions for mortgage interest, rent and charitablecontributions. He would also impose a 13% value-added tax ongoods and services. The tax package grows out of his talkswith Jude Wanniski, a longtime booster of supply-sideeconomics.   Robert S. McIntyre, director of Citizens for Tax Justicein Washington, says Mr. Brown's program, if taken literally,would increase the federal budget deficit by more than $200billion a year, triple the taxes of poor families and cut theeffective tax rate on the very rich by a third.   Mr. Brown says he doesn't accept Mr. McIntyre's figures,but he offers no figures of his own. If it turns out there isa problem for poor people under his program, Mr. Brown says,&quot;We can create social equity. The federal government canassist people. You can do it in a direct expenditure forfamilies who don't have adequate income.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
