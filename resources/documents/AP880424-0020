(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The passage of Maryland's new law banningcheap handguns stems in part from an epidemic of drug-relatedkillings, but it also owes a lot to a state senator's embarrassmentat a Washington party.   What embarrassed state Senate President Thomas V. Mike Milleralso made him a center of attention, and that led to a meeting witha woman who is a driving force in the move for gun controllegislation.   Miller's secretary misread an invitation to a Gridiron Clubevent last year as saying white attire was required, instead ofwhite tie, so Miller was the only one who showed up in a whitetuxedo.   He was approached by Sarah Brady, wife of presidential presssecretary James Brady, who was severely injured in the 1981assassination attempt on President Reagan.   ``It was unbelievable,'' recalled Miller. ``There I wasred-faced, standing 15 feet from President Reagan, and Sarah Bradycomes over and tries to make me feel at ease. She told me I was theonly thing adding any pizazz to the party.''   They met again a few weeks ago when Mrs. Brady, who has becomeactive in the fight for gun control legislation, asked for Miller'shelp in pushing a bill that would outlaw the sale and manufacturein Maryland of cheap handguns commonly known as Saturday NightSpecials.   ``I was impressed with her and when I was given the opportunityto help it was the least I could do for her,'' he said.   The law, which Gov. William Donald Schaefer has promised tosign, will require a nine-member state board to draw up a list ofacceptable handguns. Those not on the list would be banned inMaryland, and violators would be liable for stiff fines, up to$10,000 for each illegal gun sold or manufactured.   The ban won't go into effect until January 1990, giving theNational Rifle Association a chance next year to try to have itrepealed. NRA officials have vowed to make such an attempt.   While four other states have laws that ban cheap guns based onthe melting point of a weapon's metal, the Maryland measure isconsidered by its supporters to be much broader. They hope it willbe used as a model by other states.   Gun control advocates also see the Maryland experience as auseful political primer in how to withstand the powerful NRA.   ``Miller was absolutely crucial,'' said Del. Peter Franchot, oneof a cadre of lawmakers who pushed the bill through the House ofDelegates.   ``He just stood up for the gun-control bill and stared down theNRA,'' Franchot said. ``We just sat back there in awe at the wayMiller pushed the thing through. We would have been nowhere withoutthe political muscle of the president.''   Miller acknowledged the role played by Mrs. Brady's personallobbying, but said a more important factor was the attitude of theNRA itself.   ``The very fact that they were opposed to (banning) guns thatcould go past metal detectors turned off a great manylegislators,'' he explained. ``The fact that they were opposed tobanning tin and plastic guns that sell for $29.95 whose solepurpose is to kill, that told the General Assembly of Maryland thatthey weren't interested in a reasonable compromise.''   Agreeing with that analysis was Michael Beard, director of theNational Coalition to Ban Handguns: ``The NRA, I think, just blewit. They were too arrogant.''   Miller, Franchot and Beard also agreed that the recent rash ofshootings by teen-agers hooked into the drug trade in Baltimore andmetropolitan Washington was a crucial factor.   Credit also was given to effective personal lobbying by CorettaScott King, wife of slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King,and other victims of violence.   Ted Lattanzio, the NRA's director of state and local affairs,cited those and other factors for creating an ``emotionalhysteria'' that made passage possible.   ``It was a concerted effort by the governor, other politicalleadership, gun-control groups and the media that steamrolled anunfortunate law, which deludes the public into thinking it willhave an impact on crime, which it won't,'' Lattanzio said.</TEXT></DOC>
