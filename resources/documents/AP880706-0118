(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The state's highest court has ruledWest Virginia's gun law unconstitutional, which some authoritiessay means people may legally carry concealed weapons.   The state Supreme Court ruling ``effectively invalidatedprohibition against carrying dangerous and deadly weapons,'' statepolice Superintendent W.F. Donohoe said Tuesday.   ``However, all other firearms-related charges are still valid,such as brandishing, assault with a deadly weapon, etc.,'' he said.   A Department of Public Safety spokesman said authorities areworried about an increase in gun-related crimes.   ``Absolutely, people are carrying weapons indiscriminately;people are going to be shot with tempers flying; there are going tobe increases in assaults with police officers, increases in deathsin domestic situations,'' said Trooper Ric Robinson.   ``It in general puts everyone in a far more dangerous posture.''   The court unanimously ruled Friday that a 1986 stateconstitutional amendment invalidated a 1975 law requiring permitsfor people carrying concealed weapons.   The amendment, overwhelmingly passed by voters, guarantees that``a person has the right to keep and bear arms for the defense ofself, family, home and state, and for lawful hunting andrecreational use.''   Supporters, including the National Rifle Association, said itsimply reinforced existing rights and was not a threat to state gunlaws.   Donohoe said the ruling leaves some areas unclear.   ``It is still an unanswered question as to whether (the law) isstill enforceable against non-firearm dangerous and deadly weapons,such as dirks, bowie-knives and billy clubs,'' he said.   The Supreme Court ruling stemmed from the 1987 arrest of a manon drunken driving charges. When Princeton police tried to chargehim with carrying a concealed weapon, Magistrate Harold L. Bucknercited the constitutional amendment and refused to issue the warrant.   A circuit judge upheld Buckner, and the state Supreme Courtagreed. Justices also ruled that the Legislature can issue new guncontrol laws which would stand up under the ruling.   Senate Judiciary Chairman Larry Tucker, a Democrat, says hethinks police can handle the situation until next regular sessionin January. The state already has had three special sessions thisyear, and ``it would be a waste of money to come back again,'' saidTucker.   Under the stricken law, West Virginians were allowed to carryfirearms without permits only to and from a place of purchase orrepair, an authorized shooting range or during hunting seasons.Violation meant a mandatory six-month jail sentence for firstoffenders. A second offense was a felony.   Robinson said those constraints are gone: ``If you want to takea pistol and stick it in your pocket, your purse, your swim trunks,the Supreme Court decision allows that.''   But he said he did not think most West Virginians now werepacking guns. ``I'd say most people are not aware of thedecision,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
