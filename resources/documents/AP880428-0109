Organizers said 16,000 workers, or half the work force, were onstrike at the mills outside the southern city of Krakow to demandhigher pay. It is Poland's largest work stoppage since martial lawstifled the independent Solidarity labor union 6{ years ago.   Negotiations at the Lenin works broke off early today.   Alfred Miodowicz, a member of Poland's Communist Party Politburoand the head of the All-Poland Trade Union Alliance, was at themill and said another government official, Deputy Prime MinisterZbigniew Szalajda, also was expected. Szalajda is the government'sindustrial policy chief.   The personal involvement of two senior officials indicated ahigh level of official concern about the strike, which comes only afew days before official May Day celebrations, an annual time ofprotest for government opponents.   Miodowicz, who began his career as a steel worker at the Leninplant in Nowa Huta outside Krakow, is the head of the unionalliance created in 1982 to take Solidarity's place.   Asked by a Western reporter about the possibility of using forceto break the strike, Miodowicz said, ``I don't think that will benecessary.''   In other developments, about 100 people staged a brief rally inKrakow in support of the strike. Solidarity activists in thesoutheastern Polish city of Stalowa Wola reaffirmed their call fora strike Friday at an 18,000-worker heavy machinery plant there.   The government has raised prices 42 percent so far this year aspart of a program to make the economy more market-oriented, andthere is widespread discontent that wages are lagging behindinflation.   The 16-member strike committee was formally notified by aprosecutor today that their strike was illegal, and company foremenwere distributing forms in which each worker was asked to declarein writing whether or not he was on strike.   But the committee said it would ignore the prosecutor's letterand told workers not to sign the forms, said Zygmunt Lenyk, anopposition activist in Krakow.   Amid signs of increasing tension at the plant, negotiations withthe strike committee that began at midnight lasted just 15 minutes,and one committee member said they were told by a director that ifa political solution was not found soon, ``the ZOM0 (special riotpolice) will take over.''   On Wednesday, the strikers rejected a government offer thatnearly met their demand for a 50 percent pay increase.   Management later told strike leaders that if no agreement wasreached, it ``would not be responsible for the security of thestrikers,'' Solidarity adviser Jacek Kuron said today in Warsaw.   Stanislaw Handzlik, a strike committee member, said by telephonethat more than 12,000 strikers were at the plant this morning.Organizers said workers were rotating inside the plant, staying twoshifts then going home for one.   Outwardly, the plant appeared calm, with no banners and littleactivity.   The government was to enter talks today with city transitworkers in Lodz, Torun and Grudziadz, who are seeking higher wages.   On Monday, transit workers in the northwestern city of Bydgoszczstaged an 11-hour strike and won a 60 percent raise. A day later,the strike began at the Lenin mills. Organizers said it wasspontaneous.   The labor troubles are Poland's most serious since the yearlongheyday of the now-outlawed Solidarity trade union movement, whichended with the government's December 1981 crackdown. Strikes ofoccupation were then violently broken up by riot police andhundreds of union supporters interned.   Solidarity Chairman Lech Walesa, in a statement issued from hishome in the northern port of Gdansk on Wednesday, urged Poles to``put pressure on the authorities'' and called for the restorationof Solidarity's legal status.   The strikers at the steel mills have demanded the governmentdouble the current $15 compensation for the price increases forindustrial workers, retirees, teachers and health workers.   For themselves, they demanded an immediate 50 percent raise intheir average $105 monthly pay. Kuron, the Solidarity adviser, saidthey turned down a management offer of a $50 raise to be phased inby October.   Strikes over higher prices have a long tradition in postwarPoland and caused government shakeups in 1956, 1970 and 1980.</TEXT></DOC>
