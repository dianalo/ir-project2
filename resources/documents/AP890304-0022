Airports that handle heavy Eastern traffic boosted policepatrols, designated picket areas and mapped contingency plans tokeep operations running normally after the Machinists went on strikeat 12:01 a.m. EST Saturday.   Machinists quickly established that they intended to shut Easterndown, storming the gate at Miami International Airport. Police inriot gear helped push them back.   At approximately 12:10 a.m., the 3,400 Eastern pilots votedoverwhlemingly to honor the Machinists strike.   J. B. ``Skip'' Stokes, spokesman for Eastern members of the AirLine Pilots Association said early Saturday: ``We will honor theirpicket.''   Referring to the pilots who don't honor the picket line, he said``a shadow would be cast over them for perhaps the rest of theircareers at Eastern.''   Negotiations between the airline and Eastern collapsed despite anundisclosed offer by the carrier at 10 p.m., two hours before thedeadline, and Machinists' officials offering to extend talks at themediators' request.   Defensive activities were especially evident at airports in southFlorida, the Miami-based Eastern's home region. Security also wasbeefed up at many airports, including Atlanta, Washington, Seattle,Philadelphia and Newark, N.J.   Preparations took on new urgency Friday afternoon when PresidentBush announced he would not intervene in the bitter labor dispute _an action that would have stalled a strike by triggering a 60-daycooling-off period.   Eastern cut up to three-quarters of its weekend flights onFriday, including most out of its Atlanta hub and nearly 60 othercities. The airline planned to maintain service to almost 50 cities,including most flights out of Miami and on Eastern's Northeastshuttle and Latin American routes.   Other carriers moved in to pick up some of the slack.   Pan American World Airways said it would add two or three flightsper hour on its shuttle service from New York to both Boston andWashigton.   Delta Air Lines said it would consider adding flights fromEastern's Atlanta hub to Florida and from Northeast points south. Itplanned to honor Eastern tickets, with certain conditions.   Continental Airlines, American Airlines and United Airlines saidthey would honor some Eastern tickets but planned no additionalservice.   Greyhound Lines said it planned expanded bus service beginningMonday.   Amtrak said it would add 12 daily trains between New York andWashington. In the event of a secondary strike, the rail line saidit would attempt skeleton service run by supervisors. Amtrak carries33,000 passengers on 108 trains a day in the Northeast corridor and28,000 daily passengers elsewhere.   In Washington, the head of Amtrak said the national passengerrailroad could continue limited operations for only a few days ifpicketed by workers supporting an Eastern strike.   A recording on a Amtrak station telephone line in Providence,R.I., said, ``The effect of an Eastern strike is uncertain. Ourcurrent plans are to operate a normal schedule.'' The recordingbegan by stating that lines were tied up because of the anticipatedstrike.   National union leaders and locals threatened to disrupttransportation around the country in sympathy with the EasternMachinists.   In Newark, Gene Hoffman, general chairman of District 100 of theMachinists, said there was a ``good possibility'' union members atTrans World Airlines, United Air Lines, Northwest Airlines and USAirwould strike if the Eastern Machinists walked out.   In metropolitan New York, freight railroads and commuter linesthat carry about 320,000 people into Manhattan each day expected tobe hit by a secondary strike.   ``It looks like a very bad situation,'' said Robert Kiley,chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, parent agencyof the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North Commuter Railroad.   Extra buses were ordered to shuttle passengers from outlyingsuburbs in western Connecticut and the northern suburbs to subwayterminals in the Bronx and Queens.   The Long Island Rail Road established telephone hotlines to helpcommuters find alternative routes and subway connections. The cityDepartment of Transportation said it would put extra traffic agentsat busy intersections and activate all tow trucks to deal with ananticipated surge in traffic.   At the port of Miami, port officials and cruise linerepresentatives made contingency plans for an estimated 8,000 to10,000 booked passengers who would be unable to get to cruise shipsor return home if Eastern flights were disrupted.   At Miami International Airport, adjacent to Eastern's corporateheadquarters, extensive preparations were made to maintain airportoperations and ``protect the public's right of access to theairport,'' said Dade County Aviation Department spokeswoman AmaliaFernandez.   ``Things are very quiet right now,'' she said Friday afternoon.``The airport is operating. We have increased police presence asplanned, the staffing is increased in all areas and will continuethroughout the weekend until we see what happens,'' said Ms.Fernandez.   In Atlanta, Eastern's second-largest operating location with6,700 employees, picket lines went up outside the Easternmaintenance hangar after machinists were sent home with pay and thegate to the maintenance area was locked. Union members set up astrike tent across the street from the gate and police set upbarricades nearby.</TEXT></DOC>
