Speaking at a news conference at the Paris Air Show, theSt. Louis-based company said the new aircraft will be calledthe MD-95. With preliminary design already under way,McDonnell Douglas said, the aircraft could begin commercialservice as early as 1995.</LP><TEXT>   The plane will be based on the company's MD-90 jet, andwould be assembled in China. Last April, China's Ministry ofAeronautics and Astronautics Industry agreed to enter finalnegotiations with McDonnell Douglas over a co-productioncontract for MD-90s. The MD-95 program would be a directoffshoot of that arrangement. The Chinese already buildMcDonnell Douglas MD-80 airliners.   &quot;We have established a good foundation with ourco-production agreement for MD-80s, and we are confident thatit can lead to further cooperation with McDonnell Douglas,&quot;Tang Xiaoping, executive vice president of China NationalAero-Technology Import/Export Corp., said in a statement.   The MD-95 would be the smallest member of the McDonnellDouglas twin-jet family. It will be 122.5 feet long, or aboutthree feet longer than the DC-9 Series 30, the aircraft itwill replace for many carriers.   The MD-95 is expected to cost a minimal amount to develop,given that the project is a direct offshoot of the MD-90,whose own development cost only about $350 million. &quot;It'sreally a very modest&quot; expense, said McDonnell Douglas's chieffinancial officer, Herbert Lanese.   Northwest, a unit of NWA Inc. of St. Paul, Minn., hasagreed to evaluate the new aircraft. The airline currentlyoperates 142 McDonnell Douglas DC-9s, the largest such fleetin the world. Larry Kahn, a Northwest vice president,indicated that the MD-95 has some features in common with theDC-9 that could help Northwest manage parts provisioning,maintenance, and pilot and maintenance training. &quot;We areoptimistic the MD-95 could serve well our expanding domesticsystem,&quot; he said.   Pratt andamp; Whitney, a division of United Technologies Corp.of Hartford, Conn., will supply engines from its family ofJT8D-200 series power plants. Discussions are continuing withother engine manufacturers, McDonnell Douglas said.   Separately from the air show, Euralair S.A., a Frenchcharter airline, said it placed firm orders for twolong-range versions of Boeing Co.'s new jetliner, the 777.The order -- the first by a European operator for thetwo-engine, wide-body aircraft -- was valued at about $300million.   Also, Canadair Group of Bombardier Inc. said it signed a$100 million contract with Boeing to manufacture rearfuselage sections for the 767 passenger jet. The 31-footsections are made up of four large components containing morethan 3,400 separate parts.</TEXT></DOC>
