(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Back-End Relational Accelerator Boosts Oracle Speed on VAXesandM;Agencies using low-end VAXes for departmental databases can add a back-endrelational accelerator, which increases the number of transactions per second(TPS) for database transactions.andM;Any VAX VMS system running the Oracle relational database management systemsand performing fewer than 25 TPS -- primarily MicroVAXes -- can benefit fromthe accelerator, said Robert Babiskin, director of high-performance systemsfor Oracle Complex Systems Corp.andM;OCS of Arlington, Va., is the distributor for the accelerator previouslyannounced, but not yet delivered, by Charles River Data Systems ofFramingham, Mass.andM;Digital Equipment Corp. has 10,000 VAXes installed at federal sites, and mostof the base is the smaller VAXes, Babiskin said.andP;  VAXes are running theOracle database at the Agriculture Department, Navy, Army and Air Force, hesaid.andM;&quot;Few agencies don't have VAXes running Oracle,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;This is not for database processing all Social Security Administrationrecords,&quot; Babiskin said.andP;  &quot;But it could be used for a caseload managementsystem in a departmental processing database supporting 25 to 200 users.&quot;andM;The device &quot;puts a midlife kicker on the performance of the existingmachine,&quot; Babiskin said.andP;  &quot;That is a major target of opportunity.&quot;andM;Some agencies would like to run Oracle on a MicroVAX, but do not considertheir machines powerful enough.andM;MicroVAX users cannot upgrade to a VAX to achieve higher performance, and anew VAX is $300,000 to $400,000, Babiskin said.andM;The accelerator is $65,000 for 16M of memory, 1 gigabyte of storage(expandable to 2 gigabytes), an Oracle license and a network interface toattach to the VAX.andM;The optimizing and multiprocessing of Oracle on the accelerator and its lowcost can deliver some of the best TPS-per dollar values available, officialsof Charles River Data Systems said.andM;The special-purpose accelerator only works with the Oracle RDBMS and onlyperforms the RDBMS transactions.andM;The accelerator does not add any functionality, but it does input/output inan extra processor invisible to the application, Babiskin said.andM;The device requires Release 6.0 of the Oracle database.andM;Babiskin expects the accelerator to be on the General ServicesAdministration's Schedule C contract.andP;  In the first year, 100 or 200 machineswill be installed at federal sites, he predicted.andM;Contact Robert Babiskin of Oracle Complex Systems, tel.andP;  703-875-7660.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
