Per capita personal income in the Rocky Mountain states averaged$14,282 last year, 13 percent below the national average of$16,444. New England, meanwhile, claimed the top slot for the fifthstraight year, with income of $20,013, 22 percent above thenational average.   It was the widest gap since 1969 between the highest and lowestregions, based on per capita income as a percent of the U.S.average, the Commerce Department reported.   It also continued the pattern of the nation's six-year-oldeconomic expansion, in which per capita income has grown fasterthan average in the high-income regions and has advanced slowerthan average in low-income regions.   ``The high-income states are still moving further away, abovethe U.S. average, and the lower-income states are moving furtheraway, below the average,'' said Rudolph DePass, a CommerceDepartment analyst.   On a state-by-state basis, Connecticut claimed the top spot forthe third straight year in 1988, with average per capita income of$22,761, while Mississippi remained in the basement with averageincome of $10,992.   Mississippi has been last in every year for which the CommerceDepartment has records, stretching back to 1929, except for 1933,when South Dakota briefly bumped it out of cellar.   Last year was the first time the Southeast, with average incomeof $14,331, did not rank last among the eight regions. Incomegrowth in the Southeast matched the national average last year of6.2 percent, while its replacement on the bottom rung, the RockyMountains, saw income grow by 5.4 percent.   When the national figures are adjusted for inflation, averageper capita income grew 2 percent last year, up from the 1.4 percentpace in 1987.   DePass said the gap between high- and low-income areas haswidened even as income growth slows down in high-income states andaccelerates elsewhere.   For example, per capita income in New England grew 7.8 in 1988,down from 8.2 percent in 1987. At the same time, last year's 5.4pace of growth in the Rocky Mountain states was up from 3.6 percentin 1987.   The Commerce Department said growth in the Rocky Mountain statesand in the Southwest, where per capita income of $14,365 was up 5.2percent in 1988, was held back by slow oil and gas exploration.   Income growth advanced even more slowly in the Plains states,where per capita income of $15,495 advanced just 4.8 percent,reflecting the weak farm economy.   The growth of per capita income in New England and the MiddleAtlantic regions, meanwhile, was bolstered by rapidly expandingservice and construction payrolls, combined with below-averagepopulation growth.   Among the top-ranking states, Connecticut was followed by NewJersey, with per capita income of $21,882; Massachusetts, $20,701;Alaska, $19,514; and Maryland, $19,314.   The District of Columbia would have ranked third if it had beenranked along with the states, with per capita income of $21,667last year.   At the other end of the list, Mississippi was followed by WestVirginia, $11,658; Utah, 12,013; Arkansas, $12,172; Louisiana,$12,193; and South Dakota, $12,475.   South Dakota and North Dakota were the only states in which percapita income fell last year, dropping 0.6 percent in the formerand 1.9 percent in the latter to $12,720.</TEXT></DOC>
