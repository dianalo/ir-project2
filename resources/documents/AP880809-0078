Bush has hit Dukakis in recent days with a barrage of criticism,saying the Massachusetts governor is inexperienced in foreignpolicy and waffles on the issues. On Monday, he set the tone fornext week's Republican National Convention, taking advantage of arare appearance for a nominee at platform hearings to light intoDukakis.   ``He's the stealth candidate,'' Bush said. ``While he can'tdecide about the stealth bomber, he favors instead stealth policies_ they can be neither seen nor heard.''   Dukakis supports research and development for the supersecretbomber but has not vowed to support deployment.   As Bush got off one of his better lines, Sen. Phil Gramm ofTexas said he wouldn't stoop to using ``some cutesy-poo'' name toattack Dukakis during his nominating speech for Bush.   ``I'm not going to demean the office by trying to think up somecute name that I can call him that somebody might laugh at,'' Grammsaid, referring to wisecracking speeches that Texans Ann Richardsand Jim Hightower made at the Democratic National Convention.   Bush stayed away from direct attacks on Dukakis today, paintinghimself instead as tough on crime and touting his opposition to theAmerican Civil Liberties Union.   ``There are those, like the ACLU, whose first concerns are theprotection of the criminals' rights and the potential abuse ofpower by police,'' Bush told a police group in Erie, Pa. ``My firstconcerns are the protection of law-abiding citizens and the abuseof our system of constitutional protections by thugs who can go andhire smart lawyers and find the right judges to set them free.''   And the Republican vice president said liberals in Congress justduck the tough issue of drug enforcement: ``Congress is full ofrhetorical heroes on the issue of drugs, but when it comes to lawenforcement a lot of the liberals there go AWOL.''   The Democratic nominee lashed back at Bush as he flew fromBoston to Cincinnati to join the final session of the NationalGovernors Association.   Bush's foreign-policy positions were unclear, Dukakis said, withthe sole exception of ``this endless fiasco in Central America,''where Bush supports aid to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua andDukakis opposes it.   ``I don't know. Do you know where he stands?'' Dukakis said toreporters. ``I don't think anybody knows where he is on thesethings. ... The only thing he's done is to express some doubt onU.S.-Soviet relations....I don't think Bush's positions are clearon much of anything.''   Dukakis did offer some praise for Reagan administrationpolicies, saying relations with the Soviet Union have improved, forexample.   ``It's an administration that's growing,'' he commented.   On Monday in Cincinnati, the governors heard a farewell speechfrom President Reagan, with the GOP incumbent staying away from thecampaign specifics but boasting of the accomplishments of hisadministration.   ``Our states, like our citizens, have known the blessings of thelongest peacetime economic expansion on record,'' Reagan said.   In the convention city, politics took a back seat to the weatheras tropical storm Beryl pounded away on the region. The stormstalled off the coast, with strong winds blowing heavy rain throughthe city.   Dukakis was weary of the constant pounding from Bush, whom heleads by double-digit margins in the national polls on the fallelection, and he said the public is getting tired of it as well.   ``I don't think they're interested in a daily diet of this kindof thing and it's one of the reasons, at least at this point, theRepublican campaign seems to be in trouble,'' Dukakis said inBoston.   At first, the Massachusetts governor said he would not respondto Bush.   ``I think the way I'm going to win the presidency is not byresponding every day to what some speechwriter has put in front ofMr. Bush,'' Dukakis said.   Then he responded.   ``George Bush has some of the highest negatives ever recorded inthe history of American politics, and I think one of the reasonsfor it is people have seen his campaign as an essentially negativecampaign,'' Dukakis said.   Bush, touring the Superdome where the party will bestow itsnomination next week, denied that he was engaging in negativecampaigning.   ``No, no ... very positive,'' Bush said as he visited withteen-agers painting signs for the convention. ``We've got to getthese differences in focus.''   He also called for a party platform that will stand up well incomparison with what he called the Democrats' ``document ofdeceit.'' With the convention his, and no serious arguments withinthe party, Bush was certain to get the platform he wants _ althoughthe party subcommittees took testimony into the night from morethan 200 witnesses.   ``We need to make this campaign a plan for the future, astatement of solutions, not an exercise in evasion,'' Bush said.   The one mystery about the four days of Republican meeting _Bush's choice of a vice president _ stayed a mystery.   ``Still working on it'' was Bush's comment Monday, sticking withhis promise to announce his decision on the last day of theconvention.   Members of the party's Committee on Contests tried to resolvechallenges to as many as 39 of the 48 delegates from Georgia. Bushwon the primary there, but supporters of television evangelist PatRobertson made a run at taking over the party machinery.   Regardless who is seated, the delegates must vote for Bush.</TEXT></DOC>
