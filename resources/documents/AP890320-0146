Residents now can obtain a Firearm Owner's Identification Card bymail. The card is valid for five years and allows its possessor tokeep as many weapons of any kind as desired without reporting thetotal number or serial numbers.   Under the legislation proposed by Democratic state Sens. WilliamMarovitz and Phil Rock, owners would have to get separate ID cardsfor each handgun, and fill out the applications at a local lawenforcement agency.   The card would be good for three years, and applicants would haveto furnish more detailed personal history than currently required.   Chicago police Supterintendent LeRoy Martin said Chicago's crimerate dipped last year and said his force's confiscation of 14,000weapons had a significant effect.   ``Over 50 percent of the 14,000 can't be identified,'' he said.``If we could trace them, it would make a big difference. We knowpeople are buying the guns and selling them or renting them togangs, and this would enable us to follow some of the weapons backto the source.''   James Zangrilli, a member of the National Rifle Association'sboard of directors, objected to the legislation.   Many states and localities have taken steps limiting gun sales orpossession in recent weeks. President Bush last week ordered atemporary ban on imports of assault rifles.</TEXT></DOC>
