 On paper, thismachine offers better performance than the existing SPARC-based Sun-4 seriesworkstations, so Sun had to replace these machines as well.andP;  And, while itwas at it, it also upgraded its 68020-based Sun-3 product line to 68030-basedmodels that offer better price/performance.andM;The result is two new workstation product lines, new packaging for thelow-end machines, and a host of new graphic options.andP;  Priced from $6,000 tomore than $100,000, these new machines offer a large array of permutationsand combinations.andM;Two markets.andP;  The new SPARCstation 1 is clearly intended to compete in twoquite distinct markets.andP;  In the traditional engineering/scientific Unixworkstation market, the SPARCstation 1 is Sun's answer to the MIPS-basedDECstation 3100 (see Vol.andP;  18, No.andP;  9).andP;  As expected, the base SunSPARCstation configuration under-prices the base DECstation 3100configuration.andP;  Sun claims a 12.5 MIPS speed rating for its machine.andP;  DECclaims 14 MIPS for the 3100.andP;  However, since MIPS is an even more meaninglessmeasure of performance of a RISC-based computer than it is for a complexinstruction set (CISC) computer, we will have to do some side-by-side testingbefore we know which machine really offers better performance for the money.andM;In addition to carrying the Sun price/performance banner in the traditionalUnix marketplace, the SPARCstation is also seen as the &quot;Next killer&quot; in thebattle to move Unix-based workstations into the broader desktop market.andM;In this face-off, the new Sun entrant boasts a considerably higher MIPSrating at a roughly similar price.andP;  However, here too we will want to do someside-by-side comparisons.andP;  The Next machine has some distinct advantages inhow it handles the screen display, in its channel architecture for I/O, andin its built-in digital signal processor which may offset Sun's fasterprocessor.andM;More important, processor bang-for-the-buck will probably not be the mostimportant factor in this particular face-off:andM;* The workstation marketplace is price/performance driven; the more muscleand speed you can put into a computer, the more successful it will be.andP;  Onthe other hand, the desktop marketplace is application-drive.andP;  It does notmatter how fast or cheap a computer is if there is no general productivitysoftware to run on it.andP;  Unfortunately for the Unix vendors, there isn't muchapplication software available.andP;  Sure, Unix vendors claim thousands ofapplications running on their Unix machines, but the great majority isvertical software.andP;  Sun has not yet been able to attract much shrink-wrapped&quot;productivity&quot; software.andP;  This is why it is having to &quot;prime the pump&quot; byoffering its own packages for word processing, drawing and (eventually)spreadsheet and database applications.andP;  (See the Seybold Report on DesktopPublishing, Vol.andP;  3, No.andP;  8.)andM;* The desktop marketplace wants a consistent, easy user interface.andP;  Atpresent, the Unix world is in the middle of a war among four competing userinterfaces: Open Look, OSF/Motif, PM/X and NextStep.andP;  We don't thinkOSF/Motif is appropriate for the broader desktop market.andP;  (See &quot;Revenge ofthe Unix Nerds,&quot; the Seybold Report on Desktop Publishing, Vol.andP;  3, No.andP;  7).andO;NextStep is gaining momentum because of the IBM and Businessland deals (seepage 49 of this issue), and because the object-oriented programmingenvironment offers real benefits to software developers.andP;  Sun must establishOpen Look as a viable contender in this market.andM;* The type of support needed in the desktop market is far different from inthe Unix market.andP;  The typical Unix user is very technically oriented whilethe typical desktop user is not.andP;  To be successful in the generalbusiness/desktop market, Unix workstations will have to be heavily supported.andO;It is no easy task networking Unix computers together, a job made even moredaunting by the fact that Unix systems will not be able to live in a vacuum;they will have to be networked to and compatible with MS-DOS, OS/2, andMacintosh computers.andP;  As the desktop environment moves toward networkedheterogeneous environments and distributed processing, system integrationwill be critical.andP;  Sun has no retail channels; it sells its computersdirectly to users and through OEMs and VARs, which account for nearly 50% ofits sales.andP;  For Sun to be successful in selling to the desktop market of the90s, it will have to learn how to support all of the other computers it maybe networking to.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
