The GAO report, released yesterday, said the FCC's auditing staff is sorely understaffed and may be able to conduct audits only once every 16 years on units of regulated telephone companies. &quot;The level of oversight we see FCC prepared to provide&quot; won't give consumers or competitors &quot;positive assurance&quot; that the FCC can protect their interests, the GAO reported. The GAO is an arm of Congress.    The GAO report follows a sharp rebuke of the FCC's oversight philosophy and capabilities in September by federal Judge Harold Greene. Judge Greene oversees compliance with the terms of the Bell System breakup in 1984. At that time, the court blocked the regional companies from entering long-distance, manufacturing or information-service markets.    In his recent decision, Judge Greene continued to ban the regional phone companies from entering the long-distance and manufacturing markets, partly because he said he was dissatisfied with the FCC's ability to regulate. Judge Greene, however, did say the Baby Bells could enter the information-services business by transmitting information supplied by others.    The GAO studied an FCC decision, made last year, to end the requirement that the regional companies provide information services only through separate subsidiaries. Instead of separate subsidiaries, the FCC required the regional companies to adopt new accounting rules to assure that they don't subsidize their unregulated computerized services by shifting costs to telephone customers. But the GAO report said those accounting safeguards are inadequate.    The FCC has begun requiring phone companies to propose accounting procedures, which the agency would then approve, and have outside accounting firms audit the companies to see that they comply. The FCC also plans to check the work of the auditors. In addition, the FCC says phone-company competitors can complain to the agency if they feel the phone companies are cheating.    Gerald Brock, chief of the FCC's mass-media bureau, said the agency remains committed to its plans but that it would try to increase its auditing capabilities. &quot;We have more confidence in outside auditors than GAO does,&quot; he said.    But the GAO report seems certain to fuel already growing criticism of the FCC's plans. &quot;Ratepayers can be ripped off for phone service and phone companies could drive their competitors out of business,&quot; charged House Telecommunications Subcommittee Chairman Edward Markey, (D., Mass.). Rep. Mike Synar, (D., Okla.), who requested the study, also criticized the agency. &quot;In order for this system to work, the FCC will have to remain actively involved in overseeing the companies' actions,&quot; he said.    The regional phone concerns available to comment on the report defended just as sharply the FCC's ability to monitor them.    The agency's &quot;record on protecting ratepayers on cross-subsidies is clear and positive,&quot; declared David E. Berry, Bell Atlantic Corp.'s vice president, federal regulatory matters. In the past year, the FCC has increased its staff by 25% and increased the number of audits of phone companies, he said, adding that new FCC accounting rules that become effective soon will further protect customers.    In San Francisco, Pacific Telesis Group disagreed with the GAO report. &quot;We believe the FCC has the resources to monitor Bell operating companies,&quot; said Ronald Patterson, director of governmental-relations planning. Evidence of the agency's ability is the reduction in toll rates and connection charges that long-distance companies pay local phone companies.    Moreover, &quot;there hasn't been a hue and cry that we have been undercutting competitors or overcharging customers,&quot; Mr. Patterson said. </TEXT></DOC>
