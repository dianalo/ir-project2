Out of thevarious imaging technologies sonography and conventional radiology areapplied sense-fully and economically in the majority of patients anddiseases. More differentiated imaging technologies, which are partlybased on digital technology, represent an essential contribution to thedecrease of invasivity and examination risk. They also contribute tothe development, that multiple examinations are no longer often necessary,if primarily the optimal imaging system is applied. Therefore it canbe observed, that with the increase of a more technical, improved imagingdiagnosis not only the examination risk but also the diagnostic safetyof diseases could be improved, and thus the general risk in the diagnosisof diseases was decreased. There is no doubt, that this way can onlybe taken interdisciplinarily and with essential contribution of physicists,engineers and biomedical technicians.</TEXT></DOC>
