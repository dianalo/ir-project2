CarrollStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 09/02/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> IBMCOMPUTERS (EDP) </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   International Business Machines Corp. announced substantial upgrades to its most powerful data-storage devices in an attempt to slow competitors' successes in that lucrative market.    The Armonk, N.Y.-based computer giant has traditionally dominated the high end of the data-storage market, capturing some 75% of the market and generating more than $3 billion of revenue a year. But Daniel Mandresh, an analyst at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., estimates that IBM unit shipments for the year to date have fallen about 15% from a year earlier and revenue has dropped some 25% because of increased competition.    It's crucial for IBM to protect its hold on this market, where it is the technological leader, because high-end storage devices provide profit margins far more generous than those available in most other markets. And IBM, which has had five consecutive quarters of lower earnings, faces such stiff competition in midrange and personal computers that it must do well at the high end to turn around.    To try to stem the tide in the storage market, IBM announced a device that will store data more densely, holding 50% more data than its predecessor in a machine of the same size. The device, at $105,000 to $128,000, will cost just slightly more than its predecessor. That means IBM, in effect, cut the price of storage about 40%.    IBM's competitors -- primarily Amdahl Corp., National Semiconductor Corp., Storage Technology Corp. and Unisys Corp. -- typically charge 10% less than IBM for the same amount of storage capacity, so they either will have to cut prices or match IBM's new products to keep up.    Mr. Mandresh said he doesn't think any IBM competitors are close to matching the new products. Because of the complexity of the technology, it took competitors about three years to match IBM after the company began shipping the first member of this family of storage devices in 1981.    Nonetheless, Mr. Mandresh said, many customers will complete existing purchase plans with IBM and its competitors before buying the new IBM products. &quot;I don't expect any lightning-like changes&quot; to the new product line on the part of customers, he said.    Moreover, customers probably won't desert the competitors, because they want to have a second source of the devices to play off against IBM, Mr. Mandresh said.    In addition to the denser storage device, IBM announced one that will retrieve data roughly 20% faster. Both new storage devices will be available starting next month.    IBM also announced a series of products that control the storage devices that will be far faster than their predecessors. The new controllers, however, won't be available until the third quarter of next year.    To accommodate users of its 9370 and 4381 midrange computers, IBM announced a less powerful and less expensive product that will include both a storage device and a controller, and that will incorporate the new technology. That, too, won't ship until the 1988 third quarter. </TEXT></DOC>
