As part of an effort to overhaul Argentina's vast, inefficient bureaucracy, the holding company will have administrative power over 13 major state companies, including such giants as the national oil monopoly, Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales. Of the $13.3 billion in foreign debt held by state companies, the oil company owes $4.7 billion to foreign creditors -- the largest share.    Other companies now under the holding company's control include the telephone monopoly, natural gas and coal companies, the national airline, railways and mail service.    Under the decrees, other companies can be added later, as long as they aren't directly related to national defense. State companies employ about 300,000 people.    Government ministries, meanwhile, were authorized to &quot;restructure&quot; their personnel, but without firings or layoffs.    The government is expected to reduce the number of state agencies and departments, with many jobs eventually to be eliminated through attrition or programs for early retirement.    The changes were included in four decrees signed by President Raul Alfonsin and cabinet members and announced by Mr. Alfonsin in a broadcast speech. </TEXT></DOC>
