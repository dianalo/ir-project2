Samoth said the assets include the Heritage U.S.A. Family Theme Park in Fort Mill, S.C., and PTL Television Network. Peter Thomas, Samoth's chairman, said the transaction is a &quot;real estate investment.&quot; He said Samoth expects to make &quot;major investments&quot; to make Heritage U.S.A. a &quot;world-class family destination resort.&quot;    Mr. Thomas, a Vancouver businessman who owns 53% of Samoth, said the transaction may be financed with the help of partners or through his own resources and those of Karsten von Wersebe, a Toronto businessman who holds 20% of Samoth. Before Friday's announcement, trading in Samoth -- which has an estimated 10 million Canadian dollars (US$8.3 million) in assets -- was halted on the Toronto Stock Exchange at 2.50 Canadian dollars (US$2.08) a share, up two Canadian cents.    PTL filed for protection from creditors under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code last year after the organization's founder and religious leader, Jim Bakker, became involved in a sex scandal. PTL filed plans in May with a U.S. Bankruptcy Court to sell Heritage U.S.A. and other assets to pay debts. </TEXT></DOC>
