It is this conspiracy that forms the backbone of the 23-countindictment against former National Security Adviser John M.Poindexter; his aide, Oliver L. North; and the two businessmen:retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord and his businesspartner, Albert Hakim.   Arms sales to Iran were formally authorized by Reagan on Jan.17, 1986 when he signed an official finding.   But the indictment charged that the defendants ranged far beyondthe president's initiative into the zone of illegality.   They did it by deceiving the Justice Department, Congress, andeven the Central Intelligence Agency, the indictment said. Officialdocuments were destroyed and transactions were concealed throughuse of foreign corporations and untraceable Swiss bank accounts,the grand jurors said.   The aid to the Contras came while such assistance was banned byCongress.   The indictment accused the defendants of repeating the samedeceptive scheme to make a profit for what Secord and Hakim called``The Enterprise'' _ and to arm and supply the Contras.   For instance in early 1986, the indictment said, the defendantstold the CIA that Iran paid $3.7 million for 1,000 TOW anti-tankmissiles when the Iranians actually paid $10 million.   The difference went for the Contras and to Swiss investmentaccounts ``under the control of the defendants Secord and Hakim fortheir personal benefit,'' the indictment said.   In May 1986, the indictment went on, $16.4 million was depositedfor the Enterprise, including $15 million from Iran for Hawkanti-aircraft missile parts, and TOWs for Israel. The TOWs forIsrael were to replenish that nation's supply for its priortransfer of TOWs to Iran.   The conspirators ``caused only $6.5 million to be transmitted tothe United States through the CIA ... thus leaving a remainder ofalmost $10 million in the bank accounts of the Enterprise,'' theindictment said. The arms sales profits again went for the Contrasand the Hakim-Secord profits.   And in October and November 1986, the conspirators shipped 500TOWs to Iran and were paid $3.6 million by the Iranians. Onlyslightly more than $2 million went to the U.S. government throughthe CIA, with the remaining $1.5 million going to the businessmen,the indictment said.   Part of the conspiracy involved North's fund-raising for theContras and the Secord-Hakim enterprise.   ``In the spring and early summer of 1985, in order to fund theEnterprise, the defendant Oliver L. North began raising moneythrough the National Endowment for the Preservation of Liberty by,among other things, arranging meetings with officers of andpotential contributors to NEPL, and others participating insoliciting contributions for ... the Contras,'' the indictment said.   ``From the fall of 1985 to December 1986, the defendant OliverL. North controlled the disposition of funds raised for the Contrasthrough NEPL.''   Last spring, two conservative fund-raisers, Carl R. ``Spitz''Channell and Richard Miller, pleaded guilty to felony charges thatthey conspired with North to illegally use a tax-exempt foundationfor the purpose of raising money for the Contras, a non-exemptpurpose. Both are cooperating with Walsh's investigation.   And in June 1986, the indictment said, North came up with a newscheme. He attempted to divert to the Enterprise a $10 millioncontribution from Brunei intended for humanitarian aid to theContras.   He did so ``by undertaking to supply an official of theDepartment of State (Elliott Abrams) with the bank account numberof Lake Resources (an enterprise account) instead of the number ofa Contra bank account, which the official had requested.''   Another part of the conspiracy was to deceive Congress, theindictment said. North and Poindexter made ``false, fictitious,fraudulent and misleading statements and representations,concerning, among other things, the involvement of officials of theUnited States ... in support of the military and paramilitaryoperations in Nicaragua.'' Such assistance was banned by the BolandAmendment passed by Congress.   And in November 1986, as a Justice Department inquiry of theContra effort closed in on North and Poindexter, they ``altered,destroyed, removed official and other documents and records,including classified documents and records of the NSC and the staffof the NSC,'' the indictment said.   It said North further tried to cover up his activities in lateNovember 1986 by making ``false and misleading statements to theattorney general'' who was conducting an inquiry for the president.</TEXT></DOC>
