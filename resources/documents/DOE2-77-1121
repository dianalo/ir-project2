With reference to the 1985 Agreement on Gas Markets and Prices,the major tasks set were: the creation of conditions for a more flexibleand market-oriented pricing regime for natural gas, the enhancement ofaccess for Canadian buyers to natural gas supplies and for Canadian producersto natural gas markets, and the fostering of a competitive market fornatural gas consistent with the regulated character of the transmissionand distribution sectors of the industry. The most obvious effect ofgovernment withdrawal has been a decline in prices. In the first yearof price deregulation, the weighted average cost of gas sold in the Canadianmarket declined 32% from $2.79/GJ to $1.91/GJ. A similar pattern hasemerged with export prices. Canadian gas prices are in step with themarket. Regulatory barriers to export sales have effectively been removedby the introduction of market-based surplus determination procedures,by the removal of volume and end user restricitons on exports by short-termorder, and by on-going efforts to expedite the federal approval process.Regulatory barriers to the interprovincial gas market have also beenlessened. Benefits to consumers include the lowest commodity prices fornatural gas in real terms since 1976, gas prices that are very competitivewith alternate fuels, and greater gas supply choice than ever before.A balanced, co-operative approach among all segments of the industrywill be essential to sustain and expand marketing efforts.</TEXT></DOC>
