Top officials at the exchange distributed a letter Tuesdaysaying, ``We will never tolerate violations of our rules andregulations and have always aggressively prosecuted those who havebroken our rules.''   The BOT and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange _ the nation'slargest commodities exchanges _ are at the center of aninvestigation into allegations that up to 100 brokers and traderscheated customers out of millions of dollars.   FBI agents posing as traders wore hidden tape recorders todocument alleged wrongdoing in the crowded, frantic trading pits.   Illinois Farm Bureau President John White Jr. warned Tuesday ofserious consequences from the two-year investigation.   ``These are not just Chicago markets _ these are world marketsand these are my markets,'' White, a Kane County grain farmer, saidin a telephone news conference.   ``The public must feel that traders on the floor of the exchangesare working honestly and in an open environment.''   The FBI on Tuesday subpoenaed clearing firms that serve theexchanges, while a federal grand jury was assembled to begin hearingtestimony from traders subpoenaed last week, according to defenseattorneys.   The Chicago Tribune said at least 200 subpoenas were issued aspart of ``Operation Sourmash,'' and some of the recipients were:David H. Horberg, a former co-head of the Merc's powerful yenfutures committee; James Nowak, a major soybean broker; and MartinDempsey, a soybean trader who sold his BOT seat last week for$415,000.   Subpoenas were also delivered to Continental Illinois Corp. ofChicago, which owns Capital First Options Inc., and J.P. Morgan andamp;Co. of New York, the Tribune said.   ``I hope it's only a fishing expedition,'' said John Sandner,chief executive officer of RBandamp;H Inc., which also was served. ``Iwould not want to believe there's such widespread corruption thatwould require such a widespread investigation.''   U.S. Attorney Anton R. Valukas and FBI officials declined tocomment on the latest developments.   Clearing firms, which must own seats to do business, are amongthe exchange's largest members. They have authority to handle retailorders and contract out the physical trading of those orders in thepit to independent traders, also known as locals.   A Merc spokeswoman, Julie Jacobs, said exchange officials had noidea how many of the exchange's 81 clearing firms were subpoenaed.   ``Chicago Mercantile Exchange officials were informed that manyof the CME clearing member firms have been served with subpoenas toprovide various records relating to trading activity on the ChicagoBoard of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,'' the Merc said.   The statement said the subpoenas ``do not imply that the firms... or their officers are targets of the investigation, or aresuspected of any wrongful actions.''   The BOT and Merc are marketplaces in which buyers and sellersessentially bet millions of dollars on the future prices offinancial instruments and commodities, such as Treasury bills orsoybeans.   The Board of Trade's letter, signed by Karsten Mahlmann, chairmanof the board at the exchange, and Thomas R. Donovan, president andchief executive officer, said:   ``If any members have taken part in trading practices which areillegal or violate our rules and regulations they are notrepresentative of the 3,500 members of the CBOT.''</TEXT></DOC>
