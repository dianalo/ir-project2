Halos of galactic scale form in abundance onlyafter z of about 3. Most present-day halos had at least two progenitorsof similar size at z not less than 1. The typical rotation speed of halosat the present day is only about 10 percent of their rms velocity dispersion.Dark halos are generically triaxial with, perhaps, a slight preferencefor near-prolate configurations. It is concluded that, if it is correct,the standard idea that galaxies form by condensation of gas with darkhalos may actually require a high-density universe in order to be compatiblewith observation. 44 references.</TEXT></DOC>
