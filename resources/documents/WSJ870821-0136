MITI's director-general of the trade-policy bureau, Shigeo Muraoka, will leave Japan next Tuesday to consult for several days with top administration officials in the U.S. capital before attending the biannual U.S.-Japan trade talks to be held in Hawaii Aug. 31 to Sept. 1.    The Hawaii talks will discuss general U.S.-Japan trade problems, including issues affecting agricultural products and semiconductors.    While in Washington, Mr. Muraoka is expected to focus his efforts on arguing against congressional passage of a toughened omnibus trade bill which calls for retaliation against Toshiba for the sales, which were violations of the Paris-based Coordinating Committee for Export Control, or Cocom.    The U.S. Congress is scheduled to convene during the second week of September and is expected to attempt to reconcile different trade bills passed earlier by the House and Senate. </TEXT></DOC>
