Grace Names Bolduc as President,   Operating Chief of Chemical Company   ----   By Richard Koenig   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>08/03/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B8</SO><CO>   GRA WNEWS</CO><IN>CHEMICALS, PLASTICS (CHM)</IN><LP>   J.P. Bolduc, who has played a major role in restructuringthe varied business lines of W.R. Grace andamp; Co., was namedpresident and chief operating officer at the diversifiedchemical concern.   Mr. Bolduc, 51 years old, has been one of the three vicechairmen at Grace whom Chief Executive Officer J. Peter Gracehas been considering as possible successors. Mr. Bolduc thusappears to have won an edge, though Mr. Grace, 77, gave noindication that he's preparing to step down.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Bolduc, who joined Grace in 1983, succeeds Charles H.Erhart Jr., who is retiring as president and will remain adirector. Mr. Erhart, 65, was elected president last year,but he wasn't considered a potential successor to Mr. Grace.   Mr. Bolduc has been deeply involved in the company'srestructuring efforts and recently has been responsible forthe company's business groups outside its core specialtychemicals segment. Although the restructuring has alreadyresulted in asset sales totaling some $2.3 billion since1986, still more changes are widely expected.   &quot;We're looking for continued restructuring at Grace. J.P.Bolduc has been the quarterback in that,&quot; said Mark R.Gulley, a chemical-industry analyst at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co.   In an interview, Mr. Bolduc said his role in those effortswill expand. He didn't disclose which of the company'sbusinesses -- which range from fireproofing materials tokidney dialysis to artificial insemination of dairy herds --may be affected. But he said the company is no longerlimiting the possibilities to businesses outside itsspecialty chemicals stronghold.   Mr. Bolduc also emphasized that Grace will consider notonly sales but spinoffs to shareholders, public offerings,partnerships and joint ventures. The company, in fact, hasalready started along that route, having sold 17% of its oiland coal operations to the public last year.   He disclosed that Grace last year rejected an offer froman unidentified bidder for its entire specialty businessesgroup, whose interests include cocoa products, bookdistribution and textiles, and whose total sales in 1989 were$1.69 billion. Grace had sales of $6.11 billion last year.   He explained that Grace had doubts about the offer, partlybecause at about the same time Grace was selling a singleindustrial-equipment rental business for what it considered ahigh price, $305 million, or 25 times the 1988 earnings ofthe business. The buyer was Compagnie Francaise de l'AfriqueOccidentale, Paris. That led Grace to think it wouldn't get apremium for its specialty businesses if it sold them as agroup rather than selling or otherwise restructuring themseparately.   &quot;It became obvious that while we could have sold thebusinesses at a good price and for a good gain, we'd bebetter off if we handled it differently,&quot; he said.   How well Grace fares in additional restructuring willdoubtless figure in whether Mr. Bolduc ultimately succeedsMr. Grace, who has held the top post at the company since1945. Mr. Grace himself said the board didn't say anythingabout any succession issues while electing Mr. Buldoc aspresident. But Mr. Grace, the company's chairman, added,&quot;It's a good move up.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
