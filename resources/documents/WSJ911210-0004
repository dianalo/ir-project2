The textile company, based in Dublin, Ga., is planning aninitial public offering of 3.1 million common stock tofinance a debt-swap offer that it began yesterday. It isoffering to swap cash and unregistered shares of common stockfor as much as $50 million in senior subordinated notes. Thecompany's debt stands at about $156.6 million, with about$102.9 million in notes.</LP><TEXT>   Odyssey Partners L.P., the New York leveraged buy-out firmthat bought 58% of Forstmann for $4 million, plans to offerfor exchange $46.2 million, or its total holding of thenotes. However, if all of the notes are tendered, Forstmannwill accept as much as $50 million on a pro-rata basis. Thiswould reduce by about half the amount of debt swapped byOdyssey.   Forstmann was created in a $105 million buy-out bymanagers of certain J.P. Stevens andamp; Co. assets in 1986. Itwent public in mid-1987, but steadily posted losses. It wastaken private in 1989 through a $65.5 million leveragedbuy-out by Odyssey Partners and textile investor JamesAmmeen, a former Burlington Industries Inc. executive. Thebuyers also assumed Forstmann's $120 million debt. Aspokeswoman for the company said that Mr. Ammeen ceased tohold an interest in Forstmann more than a year ago but shedeclined to elaborate.   Under the swap offer, which will expire Jan. 7, Forstmannwill give $580 in cash and $420 in unregistered common sharesfor each $1,000 face amount of the notes. It also will givecash equal to the accrued interest on the notes. Theunregistered shares can't be sold for 24 months.   Forstmann hopes to raise about $33.6 million from theoffering, which is expected to be priced at $11 to $13 ashare. The public issue and swap offer would give the company4.7 million shares outstanding. If Odyssey does swap the$46.2 million of notes that it holds, its new stake inForstmann would be 34.3%, a spokeswoman said.   The company is seeking a listing on the Nasdaq's NationalMarket System under the symbol FSTM.   Forstmann makes fabrics, primarily wool, for use in theproduction of brandname womenswear, menswear and outerwear.Among its customers are Anne Klein Coats, Liz Claiborne,Ellen Tracy Coats, Lands End and Limited.   In fiscal 1991, ended Oct. 27, Forstmann posted a loss of$9.5 million on sales of $194.6 million, compared with a lossof $11.5 million on sales of $196.4 million the year before.Interest expense totaled $21.2 million in the latest yearcompared with $23.4 million the previous year.   Forstmann added that it has received a commitment fromCitibank to extend its $85 million credit facility for twoyears until November 1994 at lower interest rates and fees.Currently, the company's bank debt totals $53.3 million.</TEXT></DOC>
