Failure to recognize thatactions taken to reduce energy consumption by one part of a complicatedsystem may increase energy consumption or bring about some other negativeimpact elsewhere in the system is a common cause of ineffectiveness ofenergy conservation programs. Indeed, a vast array of energy conservationand fuel substitution opportunities is always available. The difficulttask is to identify the optimum mix considering the costs and benefitsassociated with each set of actions together with the resources available.These costs, benefits, and resources must include the intangible (personaland organizational relationships inside and outside the organization)as well as the technical and economic. Energy management is the processof achieving a high level of knowledge of energy consumption patterns,a method for comprehensively identifying and analyzing new opportunities,and a means of stimulating human commitment. This paper discusses theinformation system that must lie at the heart of any well-developed energymanagement activity and suggests some candidate energy end-use retrofittechnologies emerging for institutional buildings.</TEXT></DOC>
