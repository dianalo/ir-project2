The biotechnology concern, which develops genetically engineered vaccines and diagnostics, said Mimesys will use recombinant DNA techniques to &quot;produce the actual targets of pharmaceutical agents,&quot; such as cell receptors and and enzymes. Researchers at the unit will study those targets to understand why cells respond to compounds that act on them. When those processes are understood, a spokesman said, the researchers will test existing or new chemical compounds on the cell receptors, in search of new treatments.    A Chiron spokesman said such research contrasts with that of most biotechnology companies, which are concentrating on developing substances already known to exist in the body.    Chiron said it signed five-year agreements with Warner-Lambert Co. to develop anti-cancer and central nervous system therapeutics, and expanded an earlier agreement with Johnson andamp; Johnson to include receptor research aimed at developing materials to promote tissue healing. </TEXT></DOC>
