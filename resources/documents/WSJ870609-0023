The Owens-Illinois case shows that new bondholders who climb aboard after the buyout don't always get everything they want either.    Last month, the glass-container maker issued $1.44 billion of junk bonds to repay some of the $3.6 billion that Kohlberg Kravis Roberts borrowed in March to take the company private.    Money managers complain that the 12 1/4% to 12 3/4% yields on Owens-Illinois' more senior junk bonds were &quot;too skinny.&quot; What's more, buyers of junior bonds had to swallow unusual limits on their right to demand money back if the company runs into trouble. The junior bonds, priced to yield 14 1/2% to 14 3/4%, were zero coupons that accrue interest until maturity and payment-in-kind bonds that pay interest in additional bonds.    &quot;They're making you more of an equity holder&quot; than a conventional bondholder, says Gerald Unterman of Solomon Asset Management. The Owens-Illinois prospectus shows that $4 billion of loans advanced by bank creditors and senior junk-bond holders stand ahead of the junior holders, magnifying the latter's risks.    The company's investment bankers at Morgan Stanley cut back the May offering from a planned $2 billion, withdrawing many zero-coupon and 12 3/4% bonds. Some traders think underwriters still had trouble selling all the remaining bonds. At that time, traders note, the entire bond market was in disarray from rising interest rates. Since then, Owens-Illinois' bonds have traded higher, but the entire bond market has recovered, too.    Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley was able to drive a hard bargain. Investors have made so much money from high-quality leveraged buyouts like Beatrice's that they're apparently willing to accept less favorable terms. Issuers and their bankers &quot;can afford to take a tough line&quot; with investors, says Solomon Asset's Mr. Unterman.    Owens-Illinois is considered classic buyout material. Its basic business generates predictable cash flows to service debt. It won't require much capital spending for a while, and it has several businesses that can quickly be sold to repay maturing bank loans and costlier junk bonds.    If all goes well, says Bob Wallace of Gateway Advisors, holders of some junior junk bonds could make quick capital gains. The credit rating of the remaining junk bonds -- and their price -- should rise, rewarding holders. Of course, lenders would all be in trouble if something goes wrong.    Donald Brennan, a Morgan Stanley banker, says Owens-Illinois is due to begin reviewing offers to buy its forest-products division by the end of this month. Analysts value the unit at $800 million to $1 billion. The bond offering was reduced, Mr. Brennan says, because commercial bankers advanced extra money on better terms.    Bob Niehaus, another Morgan Stanley banker, says Owens-Illinois' cash flow from operations in the current year should be twice as great as its cash interest charges. Among buyouts, that puts the company in a class with Safeway Stores, money managers say, and makes it superior to, say, Fruehauf or Viacom.    But some investors shunned Owens-Illinois' senior junk bonds. Given recent market conditions, they think the 12 3/4% bonds, for instance, should have been priced to yield 400 basis points over Treasury bonds at the time, instead of only about 380 basis points.    One trader sold short the 12 3/4% bonds. He thinks many of the bonds &quot;are on the shelf&quot; and their price could tumble if investment bankers unload them.    But &quot;I wouldn't be in his shoes,&quot; says Morgan Stanley's Mr. Niehaus. Morgan Stanley retains &quot;less than $10 million&quot; of the 12 3/4% bonds, he says, while short-sellers' estimated exposure is $40 million to $50 million. As for the 12 1/4% bonds, half were sold to Japanese investors, who aren't as demanding as U.S. investors, he adds.    Gateway Advisors' Mr. Wallace says the junior bonds were a better deal. The payment-in-kind, or PIK bonds were priced to yield 14 1/2%, but he expects the actual return to be much higher. The PIK bonds represent high-cost debt and could be redeemed early, he says. The prospect of an early call should push up the price of bonds issued to pay interest, he argues.    Solomon's Mr. Unterman expects annual returns on the zeros &quot;in the mid-20s&quot; over about 18 months. But buyers of zeros and PIKS paid a price. Usually, junior bondholders can instantly demand their money back if a company defaults on more senior bonds. But in this case, junior holders must wait 90 days to seek accelerated payment. The company initially proposed a 150-day delay, Mr. Unterman says.    Generally, issuers who call bonds early have to pay par value. But if control of Owens-Illinois changes hands, the zeros can be redeemed way below par.    &quot;People were unhappy,&quot; Mr. Niehaus concedes. But &quot;they wouldn't have bought the bonds&quot; if the terms were really unfair, he says.    Despite worries about investment bankers lending money for buyouts, Morgan Stanley did better than Owens-Illinois' public bondholders will do. Annualized, it earned 80% pre-tax on its three-month, $300 million loan to Owens-Illinois, Mr. Niehaus says. That includes interest of $10 million and investment banking fees of $50 million. </TEXT></DOC>
