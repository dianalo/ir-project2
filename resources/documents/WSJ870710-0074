The rally -- the eighth oil-price gain in the past 10 sessions -- was sparked by an Iranian gunboat attack on a U.S.-operated supertanker in the gulf.    The Peconic, which was set on fire near a Kuwaiti oil terminal, was under contract with Texaco Inc.'s Texaco Panama Inc. unit to deliver two million barrels of Persian Gulf crude oil to the U.S., Texaco said. When the Liberian-registered tanker was hit, it was on its way to load 60,000 tons of Kuwaiti crude.    The Iranian action was &quot;a clear sign of escalation in the gulf&quot; and a &quot;warning to the U.S. from the Iranians to stay out of their territory,&quot; said David Mizrahi, editor of the MidEast Report, a New York-based newsletter.    Coupled with concerns about planned U.S. reflagging of Kuwaiti tankers in the gulf area, the attack triggered waves of nervous buying in the oil futures pits at the New York Mercantile Exchange.    The oil market &quot;is a political game right now,&quot; said Ian Gibson, vice president at Kleinwort Grieveson Securities in New York.    The higher spot and futures prices have led several U.S. oil companies to hike the price they pay for West Texas Intermediate, the bellwether domestic crude. And the recent gains have fueled record trading turnover at the New York Merc.    Crude for August delivery rose 35 cents a barrel to $21.23. The last time prices closed higher was Jan. 20, 1986, when they stood at $21.27. Heating oil and gasoline futures prices also rose.    Spot, or noncontract, prices, posted similar gains. The spot price for West Texas Intermediate rose 35 cents a barrel to $21.25, while August North Sea Brent, a major European crude, jumped 25 cents to $19.60 in late trading.    Prices, which have surged almost 10% over the past 10 trading sessions, could soon retreat if the Middle East skittishness shows signs of easing, some analysts caution.    &quot;This was a reflex,&quot; said Mr. Mizrahi. &quot;If traders see the tensions dying down, prices will drop -- gradually.&quot;    Yet some market specialists contend that strong buying will continue to surface on price dips.    &quot;Any pullbacks will be minimal -- there are too many people willing to buy,&quot; said John O'Dea, manager of international energy futures at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in New York.    The rally is being extended by traders who continue to buy futures contracts while hedging their positions in the crude oil options market, Mr. O'Dea said.    In any event, the recent oil-price optimism has sparked a flurry of posted-price increases among oil companies. Yesterday Conoco Inc., a unit of Du Pont Co.; Diamond Shamrock R and M Inc.; Koch Oil Co.; Permian Corp., Phillips Petroleum Co. and Sun Co., among others, raised the price they pay for West Texas Intermediate 50 cents, to $19.50 a barrel.    At the same time, the rally has led to increased turnover at the Merc, the nation's leading oil-trading marketplace. Crude oil futures volume has swelled more than 75% this year compared with the year earlier, the exchange said.    In other futures markets yesterday:    COPPER: Futures prices rebounded to notch strong gains in volatile trading. It was the ninth advance in the past 12 sessions. July copper at the Commodity Exchange in New York changed course in mid-session, plunging to the day's low of 73.8 cents a pound before closing at 76.35 cents, up 0.95 cent for the day. &quot;We're seeing the impact of increased speculator and computer-fund buying coming in and out of the market,&quot; said Frederick Demler, metals economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York. Commodity funds, or pools of professionally managed money, &quot;have become big players in the market,&quot; an analyst said, and some traders are concerned that prices may plunge if the funds decide to take profits simultaneously. The price gains continued to be fueled as well by tightness in supplies, traders said. World-wide copper inventories stand at 625,000 metric tons, down 29% from year end and down 63% from the recent peak of 1.7 million metric tons at the end of 1983, analysts said. A metric ton is equal to 1.1 U.S. short tons, or 2,204.6 pounds. Meanwhile, futures trading turnover continues strong. Yesterday, for the first time in recent memory, the estimated volume of 19,000 copper contracts surpassed the turnover in silver futures, analysts noted.    LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: A late rally sent pork bellies for summer delivery soaring to lifetime highs for the second consecutive day. Continued demand for frozen bellies, which are in tight supply, fueled the advance. However, hog futures fell amid good movement of animals to today's slaughter. The slaughter is coming to the point where there will be pressure on product prices, said Gerald Abbenhaus, an analyst at A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. Cattle prices were mixed, as the December contract hit a lifetime high. Sluggish beef sales weighed against the near-term contract.    INTEREST RATES: Prices fell as dollar-watchers grew disappointed with the U.S. currency's inability to rally further. A stronger or steady dollar helps reduce concerns about inflation and encourages investment in the U.S., while a weak dollar tends to have the opposite effects. There was also disappointment about the inability of September Treasury bond futures to remain above the technically important 92 2/32 level, said William E. Byers, director of futures research at Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. in New York. The September contract closed down 24/32 at 91 16/32. Traders will be watching for further signs on the inflation front this morning as the government releases June producer price figures. Market participants expect an increase of 0.4% to 0.5%, said Frederic Leiner, financial futures analyst in Chicago at PrudentialBache Securities Inc. Rumors that the actual figures would be higher helped depress interest rate futures prices yesterday, Mr. Leiner said.    GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Soybeans and wheat futures prices ended higher yesterday, while corn was mixed. Corn futures may open higher today on the heels of an acreage report from the Agriculture Department that was on the low end of analysts' predictions. The report, released after the close of trading yesterday, said 66 million acres of corn were planted this spring, rather than the 68 million acres that many analysts predicted. The figure reduces expected corn production about 300 million bushels, said Ted Mao, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. in New York. However, he cautioned, the &quot;modest decline&quot; in supplies at season's end &quot;aren't enough to warrant a bull market.&quot; The soybean acreage figure was a little higher than expected, at 58.7 million acres. It means, &quot;we can have lower yields and still get a big crop,&quot; said Mickey Luth, a Shearson analyst in Chicago. </TEXT></DOC>
