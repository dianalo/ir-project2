Strength in the bond market eventually should spill over intolower rates for consumers on mortgage, car and education loans.   The bond market rally also means the federal government willhave to pay lower interest rates on its issue of new debt next week.   ``Eight percent had been viewed as a great barrier andeconomists said it would take a very unusual set of developments toget us there short of a recession, and lo and behold we're thereeven without a recession,'' said Maury Harris, a PaineWebber Inc.economist.   In a sign of lower consumer interest rates to come, Bank ofAmerica announced it was lowering its prime lending rate to 10.5percent on Monday from 11 percent. Chase Manhattan Bank lowered thebenchmark rate to that level earlier this month, but most othermajor banks were still at 11 percent.   The Commerce Department helped the bond market Friday with areport that indicated slow economic growth. It said personalincomes rose a lackluster 0.3 percent in June as consumer spendingdeclined for a second straight month.   Bondholders generally welcome news of a slowdown in the economybecause it implies less demand for goods and services, easing therisk of inflation, which erodes the value of such fixed-incomeinvestments as bonds.   The bellwether 30-year Treasury bond rose 15-32 point, or $4.69per $1,000 in face amount, after gaining nearly 1 point in theprevious session. Its yield fell to 7.985 percent from 8.02 percentlate Thursday. The yield falls when the price rises.   The yield on the benchmark 30-year bond had flirted with 8percent all month. Helping push it below was the Federal Reserve'sinjection of new reserves into the banking system this week as wellas a report Thursday showing slower-than-expected economic growthin the second quarter.   The bond had dipped below 8 percent during the July 11 sessionbut Friday was the first day since April 8, 1987, that it hadfinished below that level.   ``What's happening is that people are sort of coming in off thesidelines to buy bonds as the Federal Reserve easing is becomingmore apparent and the inflation outlook is looking prettyreasonable,'' said John Slosberg, senior fixed-income analyst atTechnical Data Global Markets Group in Boston.   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-termgovernments rose between 5-32 and ] point, intermediate maturitiesadvanced between about ] point and long-term issues gained about {point, the Telerate Inc. financial information service reported.   The movement of a point equals a change of $10 in the price of abond with a $1,000 face value.   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, whichmeasures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues withmaturities of a year or longer, rose 3.46 to 1,198.45 from arevised 1,194.99 on Thursday.

The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans betweenbanks, traded at 8 15-16 percent, down from 9 percent lateThursday.
