<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-10-0485 </DOCNO><TEXT>When treating phosphate ores containing cadmium to produce phosphate fertilizers,the cadmium reaches the phosphoric acid and finally the fertilizer itselfand in intensive fertilisation it is deposited in the soil with the fertilizer.In order to prevent this, the invention proposes a process for extractingcadmium ions from acid solutions particularly those containing P/sub2/O/sub 5/. For this purpose, organic solvents containing phosphane saltsand/or phosphonium compounds are placed in contact with phosphane insolublein water in the presence of halogens. The organic phase loaded with cadmiumis re-extracted in aqueous salt solutions.</TEXT></DOC>
