The company said that after taxes, less minorityinterests, or profit attributable to shareholders, it had aloss of #46 million, or 9.5 pence a share, compared withprofit of #83 million, or 17.2 pence a share, a year earlier.   Premium income rose 4%, to #2.49 billion from #2.40billion.   Ian Rushton, group chief executive, said the results&quot;remain dominated by the abnormally high level of world-wideweather losses.&quot; Royal, like most British insurers, sufferedfrom claims related to wind storms which swept Europe inJanuary and February, as well as damage from an Australianflood. He said weather losses totaled #169 million comparedwith #47 million a year ago.   Royal Insurance's U.K. operations reported a pretax lossof #39 million from a #94 million profit a year ago. Theresult was helped by pretax profit of #23 million in thesecond quarter.   The group's U.S. operations continued to show a decline,bringing a pretax loss of #52 million in the second quarter,more than double the #25 million loss a year earlier.   Royal Insurance said the U.S. result &quot;reflects theindustrywide problem&quot; of inadequate insurance costs and&quot;escalating&quot; costs of losses. Royal Insurance plans toretreat from unprofitable markets and dispose of noncoreoperations to counter the U.S. problems, the company said.   The company's world-wide operations, which includeContinental Europe and Australia, had a pretax loss of #10million.   One analyst said that the size of the company's losses inthe first half means it may make a small pretax loss for theyear. Originally, he had forecast a pretax profit of #34million for 1990.</TEXT></DOC>
