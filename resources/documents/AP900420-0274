Affected models are the 2.2-liter Plymouth Horizon, Turismo andReliant; the Dodge Omni, Charger, Aries, 600ES and 400; andChrysler LeBaron. Only vehicles with manual transmissions areinvolved, and California vehicles are excluded, the EPA said in astatement released Thursday in Washington, D.C.   In another automotive notice, Ford Motor Co. issued a voluntaryrecall of 268 Korean-made 1990 Festivas, citing faulty circuitboards that could keep some seat-belt, engine oil-pressure andbattery-charging warning lights from working properly in coldtemperatures.   ``Those 268 cars got out before we caught the problem,'' Fordspokesman Jim Trainor said Thursday. ``We notified the customers assoon as we had the parts in to fix the problem.''   No injuries have been reported because of the problem, whichdealers will fix at no cost to the owners, he said.   The EPA said the Chrysler emissions failure involved carbonmonoxide and hydrocarbons and was first detected in an agency test.   Chrysler said it will install an air-bleed assembly to provideadditional air to the intake manifold, and the ignition timing andidle speed will be reset. The repair will take about 30 minutes andwill be free of charge.</TEXT></DOC>
