When these Jaguar convertibles and stretch limousines withtinted glass reached the checkpoint, passengers got out and inspectors went towork. The trunks were opened, the hoods were lifted and undersides were lookedat, but not for rust.;    Also, you saw lines of people, blocks long. The fanscarried their precious tickets, but little else. Amenities such as umbrellasand portable televisions and transistor radios were disallowed. There was nocommon mood. A guy over here yelled for his Bills in advance, a child overthere cried in the heat. Whatever, they would be frisked when their timecame.;    ABOVE all, literally and figuratively, you heard the hum. That wasno common helicopter circling the area. That was not one of those innocentcrafts with a big bubble, the kind that provide information on reallyimportant stuff like traffic and fender-benders. That wasn't a purr. Thatwasn't a machine built for friendly skies. That was real life, a black andominous reminder of a world at war.;    &quot;That,&quot; said the security guard, &quot;isan Apache gunship. From U.S. Customs. State of the art. Our best.&quot;;    Youheard the hum, from the middle of the sticky afternoon into the middle of thebalmy night. The sound never went away, whether there was cheering fortouchdowns or fireworks between halves or bands playing or kids singing. Andyou told yourself, over and over again, that what mattered this Super Sundaywas not what happened on the field or between the hash marks.;    After allthe Super Sundays that had gotten all dressed up with no place to go butdownhill, you could settle for less. Law and order would be enough.;    Whenyou got Giants 20 to Buffalo's 19, too, it was a bonus. Super Bowl XXV wasprepared for terror, but Super Bowl XXV was terrific. This biggest of gamesthat had been decided too early too often turned up as a silver anniversaryspecial, unresolved until the last field goal attempt sailed wide right witheight seconds remaining.;    We'll leave it to Las Vegas experts to explainhow these Giants could have been serious underdogs. True, they use a backupquarterback, Jeff Hostetler, who sniffed smelling salts before victory. He wasflattened by an unblocked Kirby Jackson, and ambushed by Leon Seals, but ifHostetler wasn't about to panic, his teammates wouldn't, either. After all,with the same guy in control, the Giants humiliated the Chicago Bears beforewhipping the franchise of the decade and the quarterback of the century in SanFrancisco.;    And we'll let football mavens sort out Sunday's hiddenmeanings. Perhaps, after they look at the films, the seers will questionwhether it really is the ultimate offense when a golden arm such as Jim Kellycalls the shots. The system was supposed to be unstoppable, but the Giantsstopped it the old-fashioned way. They didn't give Buffalo the ball. TheGiants had it for 40 minutes, 33 seconds. Perhaps that, in part, tells whyKelly seemed to be forcing long passes when short was available.;    And we'llrely on the participants to clarify the X's and O's, if they can. The Giants,who couldn't come from behind, trailed 12-3 after Hostetler sacked himself fora safety. Yet that plodding New York squad mounted one drive that consumed 10plays, 87 yards and less than 3 1/2 minutes. Then, to drive home seven morepoints, the Giants went 75 yards in 14 plays and 9:29.;    The Giants beganthe game with their kicker, Matt Bahr, making a tackle. How fitting. TheGiants are the toughest, strongest, meanest bunch in the NFL, and it allstarts with Coach Bill Parcells, a blue-collar guy for whom the blue jerseyslove to play. He may look like a bartender, but he always thinks of something.No-nonsense beats no-huddle, and, considering the circumstances, Super BowlXXV beat all the rest.;    On this Super Sunday in Tampa, where that gunshipmade the rounds, it was the wee hours of Monday morning in Saudi Arabia. Thegame was available to maybe 3 percent of America's troops over there, but youfigured a purpose would be served if it entertained even one solitary soldier.You never imagined that Super Bowl XXV could mean so much to so many millionsof Americans by being not only safe, but by not being sorry.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Bob Verdi column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Tampa, Fla.  </CITY><EDITION>  South County  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910128  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  810  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday January 28, 199100028029,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
