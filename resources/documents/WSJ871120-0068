The five offices of Peoples Bank andamp; Trust of Iberia Parish, New Iberia, La., will reopen today as branches of New Iberia Bank, a subsidiary of New Iberia Bancorp., also of New Iberia, which assumes its deposits. Peoples Bank had assets of $76.1 million and deposits of $77.7 million in 12,900 accounts.    The sole office of Republic Bank, Oklahoma City, will open today as a branch of First National Bank, Bartlesville, Okla. Republic Bank had assets of $56.3 million. First National Bank assumes its deposits, which totaled $55.4 million in 7,900 accounts.    The Kansas banking commissioner closed Timken State Bank, Timken, Kan., which had assets of $3.3 million, and Alexander State Bank, Alexander, Kan., with assets of $8.4 million. The FDIC decided to pay insured depositors because bids for the insolvent banks were unacceptable.    The Alexander bank had deposits of $8.6 million in 1,300 accounts, all believed to be within the federal insurance limit of $100,000 each, the FDIC said.    The Timken institution held $3.3 million in deposits in 580 accounts, including a total of about $1,000 in two accounts in excess of the federal insurance limit. Owners of those accounts will share the proceeds of liquidation of the bank's assets proportionately with the FDIC. </TEXT></DOC>
