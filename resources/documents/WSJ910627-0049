The cashing-out trend, analysts say, is but one more signthat the IPO market is becoming even more risky forinvestors.   &quot;The fact that insiders are major sellers is something forthe investor to be concerned about,&quot; says New York moneymanager Michael Steinhardt. &quot;One is seeing the uninitiatedbuying, and the sophisticated investors selling.&quot;   &quot;It's a sign of the frothiness of the market,&quot; says JackLaporte, president of the New Horizons Fund at T. Rowe PriceAssociates. &quot;In more normal times, the institutional investorwouldn't stand for it.&quot;   &quot;I've seen more of it lately,&quot; chimes in Robert Natale,editor of Standard andamp; Poor's Emerging andamp; Special Situations.&quot;It's usually a sign of an overheated market. It's a negativesignal for buyers.&quot;   At what point should investors watch out, if insiders areselling shares as part of an offering? &quot;There is no magicnumber,&quot; says Norman Fosback, editor of New Issues, a FortLauderdale, Fla. newsletter, &quot;but we advise our readers thatif more than half the shares are being sold by sellingstockholders, it's at least a yellow flag to dig a littledeeper.&quot;   At General Physics, which provides training and supportfor the nuclear power plant industry, 3.2 million shares arebeing sold -- every one by the company's majority owner,National Patent Development. At Teknekron, an engineeringconsulting firm, 70% of the offering is by sellingshareholders.   And at IHOP, the operator of International House ofPancakes, half of the stock on the table is from sellingshareholders -- most of it offered by associates of Kelso andamp;Co., which took the company private in a 1987 leveragedbuy-out. Kelso and two related partnerships plan to unload atleast 79% of their stock.   Underwriters often discourage insider selling, because itmakes the issue harder to sell. &quot;When the market is soft theunderwriters tell insiders to hold back,&quot; says Mr. Natale ofStandard andamp; Poor's.   Analysts also frown on insider selling because, ratherthan raising money for growth -- the classic purpose of IPOs-- cash is simply being pocketed by former owners. &quot;We'revery sympathetic when we see an exciting small company thatneeds capital to finance growth,&quot; says Mr. Laporte of T. RowePrice. &quot;If it's just to pay off insiders, it makes us wonderwhat the prospects are.&quot;   Investors fear that if insiders are selling, they mustknow something. Insiders, after all, know the company best.   Companies with upcoming IPOs, or their underwriters,declined to comment, citing securities restrictions. However,an investment banker with one big underwriting firm saidinvestors should draw a distinction between selling byventure capitalists and by corporate managers.   &quot;Venture capitalists are in the business of investing incompanies, turning them around and cashing out. That is thenormal coming and going in that business. It's another matterentirely if you have the president of the company selling.People want to see the management group stay invested,&quot; hesaid.   James Nelson, general counsel for Moorco, whichmanufactures valves and meters for the oil and gas business,is quick to endorse that reasoning. He says insider sales --accounting for 70% of a recent IPO -- weren't viewed as anegative because &quot;management didn't sell a share.&quot; Thesellers, he says, include four financial companies whoparticipated in a 1984 leveraged buy-out, as well as thecompany's founder. &quot;It wasn't somebody trying to flip.&quot;   In Moorco's case, investors seem to agree. Its shares aretrading at 9% above its offering price. But in general,portfolio managers aren't so sure.   Gerry Moran, a small stock portfolio manager at Scudder,Stevens andamp; Clark, says it is a matter of degree. He is moreconcerned when managers sell, but he doesn't like to see theventure capitalists completely bail out either.   Ken Abrams, vice president at Wellington Management andsmall-stock specialist, says &quot;We take a very jaundiced view,even of selling by venture capitalists. The excuse you alwaysget is that the underwriters want to increase the float.&quot; ButMr. Abrams views the float excuse as plainly that -- anexcuse. (The float is the number of shares in the public'shands.)   Michael Norton, an investment banker at Dain Bosworth,lead underwriter for American Dental Laser, says insiderselling raises a red flag for underwriters as well. &quot;In thiscase management and insiders are still holding a significantstake,&quot; he says. &quot;We won't go forward if we feel they arebailing out.&quot;   Still, inside selling in the early part of the current IPOboom was relatively rare. In the case of such well-receivedofferings as Duracell International's, the owners apparentlythought they would be able to sell shares later on, at higherprices. What are the owners of companies with inside sellingthinking now?   (See related story: &quot;Sagging Market Spurs Firms to PutOfferings on Ice&quot; -- WSJ June 27, 1991)</TEXT></DOC>
