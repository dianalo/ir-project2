The decision, taken late Friday night in the final hours of thefirst Parliament session convened under Prime Minister V.P. Singh,was largely a goodwill gesture.   The amendment, passed in March 1988 when Rajiv Gandhi was primeminister, would have expired March 30, 1990. Many of the measuresimposed under it had already been lifted earlier by the Gandhigovernment in hopes of easing the Punjab situation.   Singh has promised to seek a political solution to the Punjabproblem and has already traveled to the rich northern farming statein hope of opening new talks with Sikh militants.   Sikh extremists, advocating creation of an independent nationfor their faith in Punjab, have killed at least 1,806 people in thestate this year, including 25 since Singh took office Dec. 2.   The victims include Hindus, the country's largest religiousgroup, as well as fellow Sikhs considered traitors ornon-supportive of the militant movement.   Parliament's lower house voted 360-1 to repeal the 59thamendment to the Constitution, and the upper house cast a unanimous140 votes in favor of repeal. The repeal will become effective assoon as it is accepted by President Ramaswamy Venkataraman, whosepost is primarily ceremonial.   Gandhi, who is now the opposition leader in Parliament, saidearlier his Congress Party would not oppose repeal.   The policy-making lower house, of which Singh and Gandhi aremembers, had 525 seats at stake in the November election. Singh'sNational Front and its allies have 277 seats, while the CongressParty has 193.   The 59th amendment had allowed the government to declare a stateof emergency in parts or all of Punjab, thereby enabling thegovernment to invoke other anti-terrorism laws that permit arrestwithout charge and indefinite detention. These laws remain on thebooks.   Singh, who is a Hindu like all of his predecessors as primeminister, led his National Front coalition through the Novemberelection with pledges to seek a political solution to Punjab.   Sikhs, who have a slight majority in Punjab, have complained ofdiscrimination against their faith and culture by Hindus.   Nationally, Sikhs comprise only 2 percent of India's 880 millionpeople, while Hindus account more about 80 percent.   The Sikh faith has roots in both Hinduism and Islam.</TEXT></DOC>
