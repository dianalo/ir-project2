 He'll really open youreyes regarding fiber-optic networking technology.andM;About a month ago, I chaired a session on &quot;High Fiber LANs&quot; at PC Expo in NewYork.andP;  Coden was on the panel along with Paul Callahan, one of DigitalEquipment Corp.'s FDDI experts.andM;The two made a wowie-zowie team, debunking myth after myth, offering avariety of network configuration options and giving the audience what oneattendee called &quot;the most useful, practical experience I've had at anindustry conference in a long, long time.&quot;andM;As the manager of a site that's used fiber backbones for nearly five yearsand as PC Week's resident evangelist on building high-performance LANs, I wasin hog heaven.andM;Aware that no one would listen to whatever else he had to say until he dealtwith the cost issue, Coden showed us some numbers comparing theper-workstation cost of a twisted-pair, a shielded twisted-pair and afiber-optic network.andM;Fiber beat out shielded twisted-pair and wasn't very much more expensive thanplain old twisted-pair.andP;  And that was with fiber running right up to theworkstation, not just serving as a backbone.andM;As David Strom pointed out in his column awhile back, the heaviest costs inrunning cable are fixed, no matter what technology you use.andP;  That's the costof the labor to install your cable and any required conduit.andP;  The per-footcost of the different cabling options is minor compared with those laborcosts.andM;After polishing off the cost issue, Coden took off after the myth that fiberis hard to install.andP;  Here, I must admit, he taught me a thing or two.andM;First, he took a 100-foot piece of fiber cable and shined a flashlight intoit.andP;  You could see the little 3mm point of light at the other end of thecable all the way across the large conference room in New York's JavitsConvention Center.andM;Then Coden made a pretzel out of the cable.andP;  I mean, he really tied a knot inthe thing.andM;&quot;My god,&quot; I thought, &quot;he's wrecking the stuff.&quot; But, guess what, we couldstill see the light at the other end of the cable, knot and all.andO;Furthermore, Coden assured us, no damage had been done to the cable, thoughhe did warn that this wasn't meant to be a demonstration of proper cablehandling procedures but simply a way of reassuring his audience that youdon't need kid gloves to work with fiber.andM;Look, No HandsandM;Driving the last nail in the coffin of the it's-hard-to-work-with myth, Codenactually installed a fiber-optic connector while he was in the middle of histalk.andP;  It was something to watch.andP;  It was a snap.andP;  One disbelieving member ofthe audience came up to the front of the room and examined Coden's connectorcomponents and tools to prove to himself there had been no sleight-of-hand.andM;Having convinced those of us in the conference room that we had nothing tofear from fiber, Coden then proceeded to debunk the myth that fiber is only atechnology of the future.andM;First, he showed us regular Ethernet adapters that run on fiber rather thanthick or thin copper cable.andP;  Though these don't offer any performanceadvantage over copper-based adapters, they're more secure againsteavesdropping than the copper-based kind.andP;  This is because fiber doesn't emitelectromagnetic waves that can be intercepted by nefarious governmental orindustrial spies.andM;Next, Coden argued that 100M-bps FDDI token-passing technology is here nowand reminded us that FDDI only runs on fiber.andM;Playing the magician, Coden pulled a fiber Ethernet adapter out of this magicbriefcase he carries with him.andP;  Then he extracted FDDI adapters for a varietyof PC buses.andP;  When those ran out, he pulled out active and passivefiber-optic hubs.andM;DEC's Paul Callahan followed Coden and firmly restated his company's plans tointroduce its first FDDI products by the end of this year.andM;Time to put some fiber in your LAN's diet?andP;
