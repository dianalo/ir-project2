Because the U.S.brick industry is not interested in having the United States Trade Representative(``USTR'') refer this case to the International Trade Commission (``ITC''),and consequently, is not interested in maintaining the countervailing dutyorder, we intend to revoke the order. We invite interested parties to commenton these preliminary results and intent to revoke.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>August 24, 1986.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Randall Edwards or Paul McGarr,Office of Countervailing Compliance, International Trade Administration,U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230; telephone: (202) 377-2786.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>On May 8, 1984, the Department of Commerce(``the Department'') published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (49 FR 19564) a notice of final affirmative countervailingduty determination and countervailing duty order on bricks from Mexico.At the time the countervailing duty order was issued, Mexico was not entitledto an injury test under U.S. and international law. Countervailing dutieswere imposed upon this merchandise, which was and remains duty free, withouta determination that these entries were injuring the relevant domesticindustry.On August 24, 1986, Mexico acceded to the General Agreement on Tariffsand Trade (``GATT''). Consistent with our earlier positions in CertainFasteners from India; Final Results of Administrative Review and PartialRevocation of Countervailing Duty Order (47 FR 44129; October 6, 1982)and Carbon Steel Wire Rod from Trinidad and Tobago; Preliminary Resultsof Administrative Review and Tentative Determination to Revoke CountervailingDuty Order (50 FR 19561; May 9, 1985), the Department has concluded thatit lacks the authority under Article VI of the GATT and section 303(a)(2)of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (``the Tariff Act''), to levy countervailingduties on duty-free imports from Mexico entered on or after August 24,1986 absent a determination regarding injury to the domestic industry.In order to fulfull our international obligations, we have developed procedureswhereby the U.S. International Trade Commission (``ITC'') will, at therequest of the United States Trade Representative (``USTR''), conduct aninvestigation pursuant to section 332 of the Tariff Act to assess whether(1) an industry in the United States would be materially injured, or wouldbe threatened with material injury, or (2) the establishment of an industryin the United States would be materially retarded, if the Department wereto revoke the outstanding countervailing duty order on bricks from Mexico.On August 1, 1989, we sent a letter to the domestic interested partieson the Department's service list informing them of these procedures. Inorder to determine whether there was any interest in USTR requesting aninvestigation pursuant to section 332 on duty-free imports of bricks fromMexico, we requested that the interested domestic parties submit a statementof interest within 30 days of the receipt of our letter. We stated thatif we received a statement of interest, we would urge USTR to request thatthe ITC conduct an investigation pursuant to section 332. The originalpetitioners in this case requested and received an extension of 30 daysto further consider such an undertaking. On September 29, 1989, the petitionerssubmitted a letter to the Department stating that they were not interestedin an injury investigation of duty-free bricks from Mexico.<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Review</ITAG>The United States, under the auspices of the Customs Cooperation Council,has developed a system of tariff classification based on the internationalharmonized system of customs nomenclature. On January 1, 1989, the UnitedStates fully converted to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) as providedfor in section 1201 <T3>et seq.</T3> of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988.All merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption onor after this date is now classified solely according to the appropriateHTS item number(s).Imports covered by this review are shipments bricks from Mexico, includingunglazed solid bricks and unglazed hollow bricks. Through 1988, such merchandisewas classifiable under item numbers 532.1120 and 532.1140 of the TariffSchedules of the United States Annotated. This merchandise is currentlyclassifiable under HTS item number 6904.10.00. The HTS item number is providedfor convenience and Customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive.<ITAG tagnum="84">Initiation, Preliminary Results of Review and Intent To Revoke</ITAG>We have determined that changed circumstances exist that warrant the initiationof a changed circumstances review. These changed circumstances include:(1) The Government of Mexico's accession to the GATT; (2) our internationalobligations requiring us not to levy countervailing duties on duty-freeimports from GATT-member countries in the absence of an affirmative injurydetermination; and (3) the domestic industry's lack of interest in havingUSTR refer this case to the ITC to conduct a section 332 investigationand consequently, its lack of interest in maintaining the countervailingduty order on bricks from Mexico. Under these circumstances, we concludethat expedited action is warranted and are combining the notices of initiationand preliminary results of our changed circumstances administrative review.Thus, we preliminarily determine that there is a reasonable basis to believethat the requirements for revocation based on changed circumstances aremet. Accordingly, we intend to revoke the countervailing duty order onbricks from Mexico effective August 24, 1986. The current requirementsfor the cash deposit of estimated countervailing duties will remain ineffect until publication of the final results of this review.Interested parties may submit written comments on these preliminary resultsand intent to revoke within 30 days of the date of publication of thisnotice and may request disclosure and/or a hearing within five days ofthe date of publication. Any hearing, if requested, will be held 44 daysafter the date of publication, or the first workday following. Rebuttalbriefs and rebuttals to written comments, limited to issues in those comments,must be filed not later than 37 days after the date of publication. TheDepartment will publish the final results of review and its decision onrevocation, including its analysis of issues raised in any such writtencomments or at a hearing.This initiation of review, administrative review, intent to revoke andnotice are in accordance with sections 751 (b) and (c) of the Tariff Act(19 U.S.C. 1675 (b) and (c)) and andSection; 355.22 (h)(1) and (h)(4) and355.25 (d)(1), (d)(2), and (d)(3) of the Commerce Regulations publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on December 27, 1988 (53 FR 52306) (to be codifiedat 19 CFR 355.22 and 355.25).<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: November 1, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Eric I.
