JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A House subcommittee is considering whetherimproper political pressure led the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers toreverse itself on an Alaska construction permit sought by the oilindustry.   The issue involves federal permits for the construction ofmassive gravel causeways that would connect points along Alaska'sNorth Slope to offshore drilling sites.   Two such causeways have been built and requests for additionalpermits are under consideration or are expected.   The oil industry says the causeways _ up to several miles long _are essential to developing oil in the Arctic National WildlifeRefuge. Environmentalists say they harm the region's ecology andfish and violate federal clean water laws.   Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., chairman of the House Interiorsubcommittee on water, power and offshore energy resources, soughtto show at a hearing Thursday that political pressure was put onthe Corps over the past 18 months on specific causeway permit cases.   Miller said information in internal documents ``starts tosuggest a political decision was made .... Rather extraordinarymeans were taken to see if the decisions could be neutralized.''   The Corps district engineer for Alaska, Col. William Kakel,decided in October 1988 that the 6,600-foot long Niakuk causeway onthe North Slope should not be built because of potential harm tofish and water quality in violation of the federal Clean Water Act.   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service had said the causewaythreatened aquatic habitat.   As part of his decision, Kakel suggested that British Petroleumfind alternatives to the gravel causeway. He also issued newguidelines on causeway permits that suggested oil companies firstlook at other ways to work out their problems such as directionaldrilling or underwater pipes.   But four months later, Kakel's guidelines were rescinded and hewas told to reopen the Niakuk case.   Kakel denied in testimony Thursday that he was pressured bysuperiors for purely political reasons and said the Niakuk permitcase was still active and may be decided soon.   His superior, Maj. Gen. Patrick Kelly, director of civil worksat the Corps, maintained that Kakel's decision was rescinded onlybecause of procedural problems and not from political pressure orindustry lobbying. He said the colonel had no authority to issuegeneral policy guidelines.   But Robert Oja, chief of the regulatory branch of the Corps'Alaska district, said pressure from the oil company, which lobbiedvigorously in Washington after Kakel made his decision, promptedthe reversal.   Oja testified as a government ``whistleblower'' which provideshim with additional protection against possible retaliation.   He said the events surrounding the decision ``convey a strongmessage about how an industry has systematically and successfullylobbied its self-interests at the expense of the public's trust.''   ``At the very least, this information suggests incidents ofabuse of authority, waste and improper command influence,'' hecontinued, adding that ``a well-entrenched system ... has grosslytwisted the regulatory and scientific processes.''   The Fish and Wildlife Service, in a draft recommendation, urgedagainst building the causeway, citing concern about the impact onfish flows, testified Paul Gertler, a former field officer inAlaska and now Fish and Wildlife's coordinator for the Exxon Valdezoil spill.   But he said under the direction of senior Interior Departmentofficials, the draft was changed, ``resulting in a letter thatomitted all of the service's technical information on fish andwildlife resources and the potential impacts of the causeway ... aswell as the service's recommendation that (the Kiakuk) permit ...be denied.''</TEXT></DOC>
