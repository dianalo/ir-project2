Richard A. Mariucci, 30, was arrested by the FBI Tuesday at hishome in the Riverside County community of Rancho, said U.S. AttorneyJoseph Russoniello. He released a 29-count indictment againstMariucci that was returned Friday by a federal grand jury.   Mariucci managed a San Francisco branch of Gibraltar Savings andLoan from 1985 to April 1989, when he was fired for reasonsunrelated to the embezzlement investigation, the FBI said.   He could be sentenced to 145 years in prison and fined $7.25million if convicted of all charges, Russoniello said.   The problem came to light two days after Mariucci was fired, whena customer asked about the $100,000 certificate of deposit she hadtaken out with Gibraltar the previous September and was told therewas no record of her account, said FBI Agent Kathryn Reeve in asworn statement.   She said an investigation showed that Mariucci took certificateof deposit checks that were placed with him and put much of themoney in a personal account, while setting aside the rest to repayearlier depositors and avoid discovery.   Reeve's statement listed eight customers who were verified ashaving deposited money that was not in their accounts and anothersix who had been identified by Gibraltar, and said the list maygrow. The indictment states 29 instances of embezzlement, of amountsranging up to $400,000, between February 1985 and April 1989.   Agents seized over $639,000 from accounts controlled by Mariucciat seven institutions on May 9, Reeve said.   Court documents did not mention the recovery of any of the otherallegedly embezzled funds. Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Zanides saidMariucci may have put some of the money into real estate.</TEXT></DOC>
