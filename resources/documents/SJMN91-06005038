Only Justice Allen Broussard voted to review the case, withfour votes needed on the seven-member court. Justice Stanley Mosk did notparticipate, for unstated reasons.;    Smith, the San Francisco districtattorney, conceded defeat after the court's action, telling reporters he hadwired and telephoned Lungren to congratulate him and offer his cooperation.;   He said he would run for a new four-year term as district attorney this fall,but would not rule out another statewide race in the future. In thepartnership between the new attorney general and local district attorneys, &quot;Iwill not be a silent partner,&quot; Smith said.;    Lungren said in a statementthat the court had &quot;declared victory for 1.4 million voters statewide, whoseright to participate in the democratic process was threatened repeatedly byArlo Smith and his supporters.&quot;;    Lungren, a former congressman, trailedSmith by about 29,000 votes after all ballots were counted on Election Day,but pulled ahead over the next week as the remaining 400,000 absentee ballotswere counted. The final tally was 3,407,927 to 3,379,021 votes.;    Thenormally pro-Republican absentee vote was bolstered by a $7 million GOPcampaign to mail 6.5 million absentee ballot applications around the state. Itmay have made the difference in Lungren's victory and in Pete Wilson's victoryfor governor over Democrat Dianne Feinstein, who beat Wilson among votersactually going to the polls.;    &quot;If the Democrats had done half the job theRepublicans did, I would have been elected in a walk and Dianne would probablyhave been elected,&quot; Smith said Friday. He referred to the absentee ballotcampaign and to voter registration and turnout efforts, but would not saywhether he thought former Gov. Edmund G. &quot;Jerry&quot; Brown Jr., the stateDemocratic chairman, was to blame.;    The lawsuit, filed by a supporter onSmith's behalf, challenged procedures used to verify absentee ballotapplications in 37 of the state's 58 counties. Secretary of State March FongEu said 1.39 million absentee votes, or 95.8 percent of the state total, werecast in the 37 counties.;    In those counties, voter registrars do not checkthe signature on an absentee ballot application against a voter's originalregistration signature before mailing out an absentee ballot. However, beforeopening and counting the returned ballot, they check the signature on thecover against the registration signature.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  San Francisco  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910105  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1F  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  482  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday January 5, 199100005038,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
