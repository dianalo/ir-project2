Hillas, chairman, called 1990 a pivotal year forthe company's restructuring efforts. He said a majordivestiture in the first half of the year reduced thecompany's size by 40%, &quot;and as a result, dramaticallyimproved our capital position.&quot; Meritor's primary capitalstood at 9.4% of assets at year end. Assets were $6.5billion, compared with $12.64 billion at the end of 1989.</TEXT></DOC>
