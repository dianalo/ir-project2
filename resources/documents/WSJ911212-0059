Comptroller General Charles Bowsher told the House BankingCommittee that real-estate accounting guidelines issued lastmonth for banks and bank examiners &quot;may seriously add to theproblem of unreliable financial data by allowing real-estatevaluations that hide loan losses.&quot; As a result, he said,&quot;There will be more banks failing without reasonable warning,the extent of losses will be hidden, and the regulatoryprocess will be severely hampered.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   In his testimony yesterday, Mr. Bowsher, who hasfrequently criticized bank regulators for not following toughaccounting rules, repeated his concerns that the $70 billionline of credit that Congress just voted to bolster the bankdeposit insurance fund may not be enough to weather thecurrent wave of bank failures.   &quot;My concern all year long has been that the regulators andthe administration have consistently said that this is atemporary problem and that taxpayer funds would not beinvolved&quot; in propping up the insurance fund, Mr. Bowshersaid. &quot;I have consistently thought it was a larger problem.&quot;He added that &quot;$70 billion is a good figure to start with.I'm just not sure it's going to be enough.&quot;   The target of Mr. Bowsher's remarks was a Nov. 7 policystatement issued by federal bank regulators in response topleas from banks, borrowers and the administration forgreater clarity on how to deal with troubled real-estateloans. The guidelines said that bank examiners shouldn'tautomatically require bankers to write down real-estate loansand establish reserves against them. Instead, the guidelinesstress that banks and examiners should look at a broad rangeof factors -- including long-term economic growth prospectsand a borrower's business record -- in evaluating credits.   Regulators quickly defended their guidelines against Mr.Bowsher's attack. &quot;I think he has overreacted,&quot; said RobertMiailovich of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.'s divisionof supervision. &quot;He fears that we won't recognize losses.There is an equal fear in the world that we mayover-recognize these problems&quot; by forcing banks to takeunnecessarily large writeoffs, Mr. Miailovich said. &quot;We thinkwe have a carefully balanced approach.&quot;   In response to business and administration complaints thattough regulation has made banks afraid to lend, the FDIC, theFederal Reserve Board, the Comptroller of the Currency, andthe Office of Thrift Supervision are reviewing the contentand implementation of their regulations to make sure thatsupervision is neither too harsh nor too easy. Next week,regulators are slated to meet with 500 supervisors and seniorexaminers to discuss how to follow the guidelines. Both Mr.Bowsher and Rep. Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas), the bankingcommittee chairman, complained that their staffs have beenexcluded from the meeting.   A spokesman for the OTS, which is running the conference,said the agency had decided not to allow observers at theworking session in order to allow regulators to discussissues involving specific banks, if necessary.   Mr. Bowsher has long complained that private accountingstandards don't require banks to recognize losses soonenough. &quot;It's critically important for the accountingstandard-setting bodies to change accounting rules so theymore accurately reflect the true health of banks,&quot; he said.He praised the banking law Congress passed last month forgiving regulators new authority to review and tighten bankaccounting rules.   But the comptroller general expressed fear that thereal-estate guidelines will make it more difficult forexaminers to continue serving as &quot;a primary force preventingthe manipulation of accounting to conceal losses and risks.&quot;He reminded the committee that the savings-and-loan crisisturned out to be worse than expected because lax auditing hadhidden the true size of loan portfolio losses.   Jonathan Fiechter, an OTS official, said: &quot;I disagree withthe whole thrust of that. Our approach is to make certainthat banks report accurate financial statements and are ontop of troubled loans.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
