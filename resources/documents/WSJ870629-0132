The views of the retiring justice, at one time a corporate lawyer in Richmond, Va., have generally been favorable to business, and have reflected the outlook of President Reagan. So his successor isn't likely to drastically change the court's voting pattern. But the business world will feel the effects of Justice Powell's decisions for some time to come.    Indeed, for the Securities and Exchange Commission, the retirement of the 79-year-old Justice Powell may be good news. He has written several important decisions on insider trading, most often rejecting the commission's efforts to find broad enforcement power in the law.    In 1983, Justice Powell wrote the court's decision in favor of securities analyst Raymond Dirks, censured by the SEC for passing on to his clients information he had investigated concerning massive fraud at Equity Corp. of America, a now-defunct insurance holding company.    The Supreme Court, reversing the censure, ruled that under anti-fraud provisions of federal securities law, persons outside a company who come upon inside information don't have the same duty to refrain from using such information, as do company officials and employees.    The ruling was a blow to SEC enforcement efforts and forced the agency to try a different approach for insider-trading cases based on theft or misappropriation of information, rather than securities fraud.    In a similar ruling, Justice Powell concluded for the court in 1980 that a printer at a New York financial printing house didn't violate securities law by trading in companies whose names he deduced from tender offers he was printing. Justice Powell said the printer wasn't a corporate insider or party to the tender offers and had no duty to disclose the information.    In a 1982 ruling, he wrote the majority opinion striking down an Illinois law regulating tender offers. Justice Powell said the law -- similar to those in 37 states -- clashed with federal securities law. But this year, he again wrote for the court in upholding an Indiana takeover law. The Indiana law, passed after the 1982 ruling, interfered less with interstate corporate mergers and was permissible, he said.    In other major business rulings, it was Justice Powell who told Texaco Inc. that it must take its chances in the Texas state courts, rather than the federal system, in its effort to avoid having to post a $12 billion bond while it battles Pennzoil Co. over ownership of Getty Oil Co.    And last year, Justice Powell rejected 15-year-old claims by Zenith Electronics Corp. that Japanese television manufacturers conspired to violate federal antitrust laws. The decision rejected a controversial antitrust theory that companies may sometimes underprice a product in order to drive less financially secure competitors out of business.    Also last year, Justice Powell concluded that trustees of bankrupt companies can't abandon hazardous-waste sites in violation of state environmental laws and said that state laws requiring utility companies to insert leaflets from consumer groups violated the companies' free speech rights. In 1983, he wrote the court's first decision permitting bank holding companies to offer discount brokerage services through subsidiaries. </TEXT></DOC>
