(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Part of David Richmond's 1990 vacationwill be spent drinking orange juice at a lunch counter in downtownGreensboro. It should be a lot easier than it was 30 years ago.   On Feb. 1, 1960, Richmond was one of four black freshmen atNorth Carolina Aandamp;T State University who walked into the downtownWoolworth, sat down at the whites-only lunch counter and demandedservice.   The lunch counter manager said no, and the store manager saidno, but the students refused to leave.   Thus began a movement.   In the weeks ahead, sit-ins would spread to lunch counters in 54cities across nine southern states. They eventually shattered oneof the more visible racial barriers of everyday life and achievedone of the earliest victories of the budding civil rights movement.   ``What happened in 1960 served to launch people of the city andnation on a relentless pursuit of human dignity,'' said ClaudetteBurroughs-White, co-chairperson of the Greensboro Sit-in 30thAnniversary Committee.   The committee is leading several biracial groups in celebratingthe actions of Richmond and fellow students Ezell Blair, FranklinMcCain and Joseph McNeil.   The commemorative events from Jan. 31 to Feb. 3 includebanquets, symposiums, a student march from the Aandamp;T campus and theunveiling of a plaque outside the store. The four former studentsalso will have their bronzed footsteps set in the sidewalk.   Richmond and his three sit-in colleagues once again will takeseats at the lunch counter, as they have done at previousanniversary celebrations.   ``We didn't do it for the glory or heroics,'' Richmond said.``It was just something that was spontaneous, something we talkedabout collectively. I don't think any one of us singularly wouldhave done it. The four of us were like a unit. We have remainedclose through the years.''   Today, he quietly goes about his duties as housekeepingsupervisor at a Greensboro health care center.   The others have left the area. McCain is an executive with theCelanese Corp. in Charlotte. Blair, who has changed his name toJibreel Khazan, lives in New Bedford, Mass. McNeil is a stockbrokerin New York.   The re-enactments give Richmond a chance to chat with Ima Evans,the lunch counter manager who was working at the bakery counter theday the students came in.   ``We are very good friends,'' Richmond said. ``We have appearedon a couple of programs together.''   Ms. Evans, who is white, said the sit-in put Woolworth employeesin an awkward situation. The black employees were sympathetic tothe students, as were some of the white workers, but they weren'tallowed to serve blacks.   ``I felt they deserved to be served as much as anyone,'' Ms.Evans said, ``but it was policy all over.''   The Greensboro sit-ins eventually involved hundreds of students.Each day, they showed up at Woolworth and at the Kressfive-and-dime store down the street, causing an uproar at City Halland in the business community.   After months of sit-ins, meetings and negotiations, Woolworthand later Kress agreed to integrate their lunch counters.</TEXT></DOC>
