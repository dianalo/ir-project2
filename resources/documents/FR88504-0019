Interested persons weregiven until October 25, 1986 to comment on the proposal. Sixteen commentswere received. A Draft Evaluation of economic and environmental impactassociated with the NPRM was prepared along with a statement announcinga finding of no significant environmental impact (FONSI). These documentswere placed in the rulemaking docket and made available for public commentduring the 60 day comment period provided for the NPRM. A specific statementgiving public notice of the availability of the FONSI was also providedon December 29, 1986, and interested persons were given until February12, 1987 to comment. Ten additional comments were received. <ITAG tagnum="84">Drafting Information </ITAG>The principal drafters of these regulations were LCDR David B. Crawford,Project Manager, and Mr. William R. Register, Project Counsel, Office ofthe Chief Counsel. <ITAG tagnum="84">Background Information </ITAG>Ocean incineration is a process for disposing of hazardous waste by hightemperature destruction at sea. In a typical disposal operation, a tankvessel which has one or more specially designed incinerators receives hazardouswaste at a port, transits to a designated burn site, burns the waste atthe site, and then returns. The Coast Guard, under 46 U.S.C. 3703, has responsibility for prescribingregulations of incinerator vessels as may be necessary for navigation,vessel safety, and safety of vessel personnel as well as for enhanced protectionof the marine environment. These regulations may include, among other things,requirements for the design, construction, equipment, and operation ofincinerator vessels. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has generalresponsibilities relating to ocean incineration activities. These responsibilitiesinclude setting standards for incinerator emissions, issuance of oceanincineration permits, and the designation and management of ocean incinerationsites. As referenced in this document, these regulations include certainprovisions which have been developed taking into account correspondingprovisions in EPA's notice of proposed rulemaking of February 28, 1985,(50 FR 8222) pertaining to ocean incineration permits. To the extent thatEPA's proposal is modified in further rulemaking proceedings, the CoastGuard will evaluate these regulations to determine the need for updatingrevisions. Technology concerning ocean incineration of hazardous waste originatedin Europe in the late 1960's. As it developed, a need for specific requirementsfor incinerator vessels became increasingly apparent. Existing vessel safetyrequirements for tank vessels did not specifically address hazards associatedwith incinerators and incinerator spaces, the sources of ignition in thesespaces, and the potential for release of hazardous wastes in these spacesduring transfer from vessel cargo tanks to an incinerator. The InternationalMaritime Organization (IMO) in recognizing and responding to this need,developed a set of comprehensive incinerator vessel requirements whichhave been included in Chapter 19 of the International Bulk Chemical Code(IBC). The Coast Guard actively participated in the development of Chapter19. Input was also obtained from the U.S. Working Group on Bulk Chemicalsof the Subcommittee on Safety of Life at Sea of the Shipping CoordinatingCommittee. The standards in Chapter 19 are widely accepted as being thebest, most practicable safety standards available for incinerator vessels.The IBC, including Chapter 19, became mandatory for states signatory tothe 1974 International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, includingthe United States, on July 1, 1986. Chapter 19 contains detailed requirementsrelating to incinerator vessels and also incorporates applicable requirementsof Chapter 1-16 of the IBC that apply generally to all chemical tank vessels.The requirements of Chapters 1-16 in turn incorporate provisions of theCode for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Dangerous Chemicalsin Bulk (Bulk Chemical Code), which was originally adopted in 1971 as arecommended international standard for all chemical tank vessels. The CoastGuard incorporated the Bulk Chemical Code into United States regulationsin 1977. These requirements are currently published in 46 CFR Part 153.The final rules in this document incorporate the provisions of Chapter19 of the IBC into U.S. regulations. They are being adopted as measuresto provide for the safety of incinerator vessels and their crews and forthe protection of the marine environment, when transporting hazardous wastesand while operating at an incineration site. At present, there is one potential United States flag incinerator vessel,APOLLO I. Another, APOLLO II, is currently under construction. The plansfor both of these vessels have been approved by the Coast Guard and theywill meet the level of safety provided by Chapter 19 of the IBC and thesefinal regulations. Also, several inquiries have been received from prospectivebuilders of other incinerator vessels.Two foreign flag incinerator vessels, VULCANUS I and VULCANUS II, haverequested EPA authorization to burn U.S. generated hazardous wastes. Bothof these vessels are required by Pub. L. 97-389 (96 Stat. 1954, 46 U.S.C.883) to undergo full inspection, including drydock inspections and internalexaminations of the tanks and void spaces, and meet the same standardsas U.S. vessels. The VULCANUS II was recently certified by the Coast Guardin accordance with Pub. L. 97-389 and was found to comply with the principalrequirements in this notice, and the second vessel has applied for a certification.Pub. L. 97-389 also prohibits other foreign vessels (<T3>i.e.,</T3> foreign vessels not owned or under construction on May 1,1982, by a corporation wholly owned by a citizen of the U.S.) from loadingbulk hazardous wastes from U.S. ports for the purpose of incineration atsea.<ITAG tagnum="84">Description of the Final Rules</ITAG>(1) <T3>Activities to be Regulated.</T3> Incinerator vessels conduct two primaryactivities both of which are addressed in these final regulations. Thefirst activity is to transport hazardous waste to an ocean incinerationsite. In this respect an incinerator vessel's operation is similar to anyother tank vessel. The second activity involves the actual process of incineration.Incinerators pose hazards similar to other fired units on board ship suchas boilers. In addition, the operation of transferring hazardous wastefrom the incinerator vessel's cargo tanks to an incinerator is an operationunique to incinerator vessels.(2) <T3>Regulatory Approach</T3>_(a) <T3>Transportation of Waste Material.</T3> The regulatory approach forshipboard transportation of hazardous waste to an incineration site willbe to apply, where appropriate, the existing requirements for chemicaltank vessels that carry hazardous materials in bulk. The standards necessaryto safely transport hazardous waste materials are essentially the sameas those applied to the carriage of hazardous materials as cargo in bulk.The principal safety regulations for all tank vessels are in SubchapterD of Title 46, Code of Federal Regulations, and andSection;150.220 of thefinal rules requires certification of compliance with those regulations.Examples of Subchapter D requirements include: firefighting systems, structuralfire protection, lifesaving equipment, cargo venting systems, and ventilationsystems.For chemical tank vessels, the Subchapter D requirements are supplementedby requirements in Part 153 of Subchapter O of Title 46, Code of FederalRegulations. As stated above, these supplemental requirements incorporateprovisions of the Bulk Chemical Code which are carried forward into Chapters1-16 of the IBC and are also included in these final rules. Examples ofthese requirements are: vessel arrangements, cargo containment systems,cargo tank gauging, cargo pumps and pumprooms, monitors, alarms, and controlsystems, toxic vapor protection, emergency shutdown, and various cargotransfer and other operational procedures and controls.In addition to the existing requirements in Subchapters D and O, specificrequirements are also necessary to address construction and arrangementfeatures concerning incinerators and incinerator spaces. These additionalrequirements are found in Chapter 19 of the IBC and have been includedin the final rules.(b) <T3>Incineration of Wastes.</T3> The regulatory approach for incinerationof hazardous waste will be to apply requirements from 46 CFR Part 63 whichrelate to large water heating equipment and other large fired units onboard ship. The hazards involved in using this equipment are essentiallythe same as those associated with shipboard incinerators. The principalpurposes of the Part 63 requirements are to preclude the introduction offuel or hazardous waste into an incinerator in the absence of an ignitionsource and to preclude the ignition of flammable vapor in amounts thatwould damage an incinerator or cause an explosion.The final rules also include requirements from Chapter 19 of the IBC asmeasures to minimize hazards resulting from an accidental release of hazardouswastes from cargo piping during transfer to an incinerator. These additionalrequirements include automatic shutdown systems, electrical equipment requirementsfor equipment located in compartments containing cargo piping, ventilationrequirements for spaces surrounding the incinerators, and special pumproomrequirements.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Comments and Changes Made in the Final Rules</ITAG>Many of the commenters addressed both technical considerations as wellas environmental concerns. Comments which are primarily technical are addressedbelow. The environmental concerns have been fully discussed in the FinalRegulatory Evaluation, which is available for public inspection and copyingin the docket, and are also summarized in this document.a. Application of These Rules to Ships Carrying Hazardous Waste in Containers(Portable Tanks)Three commenters expressed concern that the rules do not address carriageof wastes in containers, <T3>i.e.,</T3> portable tanks. Section 150.220 requires that each incineratorvessel be certificated as a tank vessel under Subchapter D of Title 46,CFR. Subchapter D in turn requires tank vessels to comply with the CoastGuard's regulations concerning carriage of hazardous materials in portabletanks (see 46 CFR 30.01-5 and 31.30.1). The portable tank regulations areextensive and are currently in 46 CFR Part 64 and 46 CFR Subpart 98.30.Subpart 64.95 of Part 64 also requires the cargo piping and hoses for portabletanks to meet applicable requirements in 46 CFR Part 56.Proposed revisions to the portable tank regulations are being preparedfor <T4>Federal Register</T4> publication in separate rulemaking (CGD 84-043)and will address principally a proposal to require use of DOT IM 101 and102 portable tanks. This proposal would also apply to portable tanks carriedon board incinerator vessels.One of the commenters also suggested that andSection;150.400 be revised toallow alternative fire protection systems, such as water spray systemsin lieu of a fixed foam system, on incinerator ships carrying hazardouswastes in containers. This comment has not been adopted. Using water toextinguish a fire in the cargo area of a tank vessel is not consideredan adequate safety measure. Foam is more effective than water in cuttingoff oxygen supply to the fire.One commenter also recommended that specific requirements be added to addresshandling and storage of portable tanks carrying dangerous cargoes at transferfacilities. Specific regulations which address this topic are in 33 CFRPart 126 (see, <T3>e.g.</T3>, 33 CFR 126.27 and 126.29) and the Coast Guard is currentlypreparing proposed rules in docket CGD 86-034 to apply present oil pollutionprevention regulations in 33 CFR Parts 154-156 to both vessels and facilitiesinvolved in the transfer of hazardous substances.b. Designation of Ship TypeFour comments questioned the requirement of assigning ship type II to incineratorships. The comments recommended that the Coast Guard apply the maximumstandard, type I, to these vessels because of the hazards of the wastesto be carried. One commenter also suggested in the alternative that, iftype I construction is not to be required, the Coast Guard should requirean adequate chemical analysis to be performed on the wastes to be carriedto ensure no mixing of type I wastes with type II wastes.The commenters' concerns with respect to type I versus type II constructionwere extensively analyzed and the determination was made to retain therequirement of assigning ship type II in the final rules. As explainedin more detail below and in the Final Evaluation, requiring type I constructionfor all incinerator ships could not be justified because of the expectationthat few types of wastes equivalent to type I cargoes will be carried onincinerator ships. With respect to the recommendation that a chemical analysisof wastes be conducted, the Coast Guard will be reviewing a waste analysisof each cargo to determine the degree of hazard involved. This review willsupplement the EPA waste analysis requirements in proposed 40 CFR 234.16and 234.58.One of the commenters pointed out that Annex II of the 1978 Protocol tothe International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships,1973 (MARPOL 73/78) applies to incinerator vessels. The commenter notedthat the 23rd session of the IMO Marine Environmental Protection Committeeapproved an interpretation of Annex II of MARPOL 73/78 which classifiesan incinerator vessel's cargo as a Category A Noxious Liquid Substance(NLS). The commenter said that Category A is the most stringent classificationand that the Coast Guard should therefore require the highest standards.Tanker type, <T3>i.e.</T3>, type I, II, or III, is assigned based on the combined safetyand environmental threat posed by the cargo to be carried, with particularemphasis being upon the immediate safety hazard posed to a vessel's crewand surrounding port area by a sudden release of the cargo. The pollutioncategories A, B, C, and D, as designated in Annex II of MARPOL, refer tothe toxicity of a substance, <T3>i.e.</T3>, they refer to the extent that a substance, without regardto the extent of immediate threat to the crew or port area, will causeharm to marine life if released. Thus, a cargo can be rated as CategoryA (the most stringent category) for pollution prevention purposes, yetbe carried as type II or III cargo on a type II or III vessel. There arevery few Category A substances that would require carriage in a type Ivessel. The assignment of Category A to a hazardous waste mixture willresult primarily from the impracticability of establishing, in advance,a profile of the environmental hazard for each possible waste in the mixture.A cargo containment system type is assigned for each chemical shipped ina chemical tanker. Regulations for chemical tankers in 46 CFR Part 153include three levels of cargo containment systems: type I, II, and III(see 46 CFR 153.230-153.232). Applying a cargo containment type requirementto a chemical specifies the extent to which a ship carrying the chemicalmust survive damage conditions given in Table 172.135 of 46 CFR Part 172and specifies the location of the tank carrying the chemical with respectto the ship's shell plating.The ship type requirement for incinerator vessels (see 46 CFR 150.255)is based on IMO regulations which mandate type II double hulled constructionfor chemical tankers. As of April 6, 1987, when the provisions of AnnexII of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution fromShips became effective, incinerator vessels must have at least a type IIhull (double hull construction) to reduce the potential for dischargescaused by collisions and groundings and also meet a two compartment damagestability standard.It cannot be accurately anticipated at this time how many wastes requiringa type II containment system will be carried. Based on experience to date,the majority of wastes proposed for carriage have been type II or III.Because a substantial number of cargoes will require a type II system,the higher standard, <T3>i.e.</T3>, type II construction, rather than type III construction,is being required as the preferred option. Although some wastes may bemade up of chemicals which, when shipped commercially, may be carried ina type III cargo containment system, IMO requirements and these regulationsdo not include provisions allowing carriage of hazardous wastes on incineratorvessels that have type III hulls. Specific provisions are not includedfor type III vessels since they cannot safely carry many of the type IIhazardous wastes that the Coast Guard anticipates will be routinely transported.As explained in Appendix I to the Final Evaluation, vessels that have atype III hull are not required to meet certain standards required for typeII construction.In addition to the protection afforded by type II hulls, IMO standardsand these rules preclude carriage of cargo in an incinerator vessel's wingtanks; whereas, on a type II chemical tanker the wing tanks could containflammable chemicals. This feature improves survivability in collision situationsby lowering the risk of fire. Therefore, a type II incinerator vessel willprovide better protection than a type II chemical tanker.It is unlikely that many types of wastes presenting hazards equivalentto those cargoes requiring a type I system will be proposed for incinerationat sea. Consequently, requiring all wastes to be carried in type I hullsis not considered justified. Incinerator vessels typically carry mixturescontaining many wastes components, some of which are highly hazardous froma health standpoint, but which are present only in low concentrations.The overall hazards of the mixtures are generally comparable to those ofcommercial products which are routinely transported on type II vessels.In addition, the type II standard is consistent with IMO requirements alreadyset forth in Chapter 19 of the IBC.As part of the EPA permitting process, the Coast Guard will be reviewingchemical waste mixtures to determine the degree of the cargo hazard. Peculiarhazards associated with the wastes may require imposition of specific controlsand safeguards. The particulars of these controls and safeguards will befully developed and analyzed as a part of the permitting process whichwill include an opportunity for public input pursuant to EPA's processingprocedures set out in proposed 40 CFR Subpart C.c. Environmental ImpactSeveral commenters on the NPRM and FONSI suggested that the environmentalassessment prepared for this rulemaking did not contain a sufficient analysisof the environmental issues involved, and they urged instead that an environmentalimpact statement (EIS) be prepared.Coast Guard internal procedures call for preparation of an environmentalassessment as a first step in each proposed action having potential environmentalconsequences. Based upon that assessment, a finding is made as to whetherthe action will or will not have a significant impact on the environmentand, if a significant environmental impact is expected, an EIS is thenprepared. In this rulemaking the Coast Guard originally concluded thatthere would not be a significant environmental impact involved and, inaccordance with our procedures, a finding of no significant impact (FONSI)was issued in lieu of preparing and EIS.In response to the commenters' concerns, the environmental issues in thisrulemaking were critically reexamined. These issues relate primarily tothe need for operational limitations and controls during vessel transit,Type I vs Type II vessel construction, additional facility requirements,worker safety considerations, as well as specific concerns relating toindividual safety requirements proposed in the rulemaking. Discussion ofthese various concerns appears throughout this document as well as in theFinal Regulatory Evaluation.Based upon the Coast Guard's reexamination, the environmental assessmentfor this rulemaking was extensively revised and the prior determinationthat there would be no significant environmental impact was reaffirmed.A copy of the revised environmental assessment and FONSI are included inthe Final Regulatory Evaluation and may be obtained from the address listedabove under <T2>ADDRESSES.</T2>d. Operational Limitations and ControlsSix comments recommended that the rules should include specific operationallimitations and controls concerning port transit and that these operationalrequirements should be made applicable to all ports. The NPRM proposedadoption of specific controls and limitations on a case by case basis asneeded for specific ports.Examples of port transit limitations and controls include: establishmentof a moving safety zone, requirements for Coast Guard escort vessels, restrictionof operations to daylight hours, weather and visibility restrictions, requirementsfor tug assistance, and a requirement to provide adequate advance noticebefore transferring hazardous waste to an incinerator vessel. As explainedin the revised environmental assessment, the Coast Guard has already developeda planned set of operational limitations and controls for possible incinerationvessel operations from the ports of Mobile and Philadelphia. These plannedcontrols and limitations are outlined in the assessment and, as evidentfrom their description, they are somewhat different for each port becauseof differing port configurations and navigating conditions. By way of example,a requirement for tug assistance is contemplated for Philadelphia betweenthe loading facility and the Delaware Memorial Bridge; whereas, in Mobile,a requirement for tug assistance is contemplated for operations inboundbetween the entrance to the Mobile river and the facility and outboundbetween the Facilty and the Theodore Ship Channel entrance. These examplesillustrate the importance of considering local port conditions in establishingspecific operational limitations and controls.In response to the comments, the Coast Guard reconsidered the feasibilityof establishing uniform nationwide controls, rather than port specificcontrols as originally proposed, and again concluded the case by case selectionof appropriate controls is still the more effective approach. As illustratedabove for the ports of Mobile and Philadelphia, individual port configurationsand navigating conditions differ and require individual appraisal and tailoredcontrols and limitations. Adoption of nationwide controls is simply notpracticable and, as emphasized in the environmental assessment, impositionof port specific controls and limitations has a greater potential for decreasingtransit risks than would a general set of nationwide controls.e. Port SelectionOne commenter suggested that not every port will be suited to accommodateincinerator vessels and recommended that the Coast Guard, in cooperationwith EPA, take necessary steps to develop criteria for port selection.The selection of ports for transfer of hazardous materials currently beingtransported in bulk involves determinations made at the state and locallevels in cooperation with affected business interests. The selection ofports for transfer of wastes to be incinerated at sea will be consideredas a part of the EPA permitting process (see proposed 40 CFR 234.18 (February28, 1985, 50 FR 8261)) and the Coast Guard will have an extensive inputinto that process as explained more fully in the EPA notice of proposedrulemaking.f. Independent vs. Integral TanksThree commenters suggested that the Coast Guard prohibit the carriage ofincinerator vessel cargo in integral tanks since these tanks would be subjectedto the same stresses to which the hull is subjected. These comments havenot been adopted. As part of the vessel's hull structure, integral tanksare designed to withstand the stresses transmitted by the hull. The integrityof integral tanks is not impaired by the presence of these stresses. Incontrast, independent tanks are typically used for refrigerated and/orelevated temperature cargoes because of the thermal stresses imparted bythese cargoes. Incinerator vessel cargoes, however, are not carried attemperature extremes and, therefore, can be carried safely in integraltanks.g. Worker SafetyOne commenter recommended that as part of the certification process foran incinerator vessel, the applicant should be required to submit a workersafety plan addressing the particular hazards encountered by workers involvedin incineration at sea. The commenter noted that the Coast Guard is thedominant federal agency for occupational safety and health of seaman onboardinspected vessels under a Memorandum of Understanding between OSHA andthe Coast Guard (see 48 FR 11365, dated March 17, 1983).In analyzing this comment, the various worker safety considerations includedin the proposed rules were reconsidered to assess their adequacy in providingeffectively for shipboard worker safety both during shore to ship transfer,as well as during transit to the burn site and during the process of burningwaste at the site. The worker safety considerations provided for in theserules include provisions concerning personal emergency and safety equipment(andSection; 150.395), eye protection (andSection; 150.450), protective clothing(andSection; 150.455), entry into spaces containing cargo vapor (andSection;150.460), a comprehensive respiratory program (andSection; 150.460), screensaround incinerator stacks (andSection; 150.330), as well as rules which takeinto account worker safety in transfer and burning of wastes e.g., operationsinstructions and test procedures to be utilized in burning (andSection; 150.365),prohibitions against entry on deck during burning (andSection; 150.457),and requirements for holding cargo transfer conferences (andSection; 150.500).Based on experience to date, these various provisions have been determinedto provide adequately for workers safety on board incinerator vessels.One commenter recommended that the final rules include a requirement tohave a comprehensive program concerning labeling and warnings concerningthe personnel hazards of the wastes to be carried. This comment has beenadopted and andSection; 150.430 has been revised to require cargo informationsimilar to the information required for chemical tankers in 46 CFR 153.907.One commenter recommended that the Coast Guard include a specific medicalmonitoring program for crew protection. Action on this comment has beendeferred. The requirements in andSection; 150.460 concerning entry into spacescontaining cargo vapors and for a comprehensive respiratory program werebased in part on the interim recommendations of a Coast Guard-sponsoredstudy of workers in the chemical marine transportation industry. (The interimrecommendations are included in the public docket.) The final report, whichhas not yet been issued, is expected to include specific recommendationson medical monitoring requirements. In addition, OSHA published in the<T4>Federal Register </T4>an interim final rule (see 51 FR 45654, datedDecember 19, 1986) to amend the OSHA standards for hazardous materialsin Subpart H of 29 CFR Part 1910 by adding a new andSection; 1910.120 containingemployee protection requirements for workers engaged in hazardous wasteoperations. Paragraphs (e) and (f) of andSection; 1910.120 provide standardsfor training and medical surveillance for workers engaged in hazardouswaste operations. The Coast Guard intends to evaluate these OSHA standardsin conjunction with the final results of the Coast Guard-sponsored studyreferenced above. The results of this evaluation will be the basis fordetermining whether additional rulemaking is needed concerning crew medicalmonitoring programs on incinerator vessels.One commenter suggested that a requirement be added to provide decontaminationstations at various locations on the ship to provide personnel protectionagainst waste contamination resulting during routine transfer operations.The possibility for contamination during routine transfer operations isconsidered remote, except possibly under occasional circumstances set outin andSection;andSection; 150.450 and 150.455. During these specified circumstances,the protective clothing and eye protection required by those sections mustbe worn. In the event that contamination might otherwise occur during anemergency, emergency showers, as required in andSection; 150.395, would beavailable for personnel use.h. Compliance With IBC RequirementsSeveral comments noted that certain IBC requirements were not includedin the proposed rules. It was not the Coast Guard's intent to exclude theserequirements and they have been added to the final rules. The additionsare contained in the following sections:<ITAG tagnum="25">Section 150.205 Definitions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Section 150.225 Required endorsement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Section 150.255 (o), (p), and (q) Cargo containment system.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Section 150.340 (h) Incinerator monitoring and alarms.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Section 150.385 Incinerator blower space.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Section 150.395(a)(3) Personnel emergency and safety equipment.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Section 150.402 Flammable vapor detectors.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Section 150.403 Toxic vapor detectors.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Section 150.432 Cargo Antidotes.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Section 150.520 Preparation for cargo transfer.</ITAG>These additional rules are not expected to impose any additional appreciablecosts over those incurred to comply with the remaining requirements inthis rulemaking.i. Section-by-Section Discussion of Other Changes MadeOther specific changes made to the NPRM are discussed section by sectionbelow along with a discussion of related comments. Minor corrections andclarifications are not discussed except where the rationale for a changeis not otherwise self-evident.<T3>Section 150.220 Inspection for Certificate of Inspection.</T3>One commenter noted that the requirement in IBC Section 19.1.4 for takingcorrosion into account during vessel surveys and determining the remainingwall thicknesses after required surveys could not be found in the proposedrules. Subchapter D of Title 46, CFR, addresses corrosiveness but doesnot include an inspection requirement for determining remaining wall thickness.A requirement for annual inspections has been added and incorporates theinspection requirements for boilers in 46 CFR Part 61.<T3>Section 150.230 Carriage of bulk solid hazardous waste.</T3>Six commenters recommended that carriage and burning of solids be prohibitedand/or that specific requirements for solid hazardous waste cargoes beadded. In accordance with these comments, andSection; 150.230 and the applicabilitystatement in andSection; 150.200 has been revised in the final rules to emphasizethat the requirements in this rulemaking apply only to carriage of liquidwastes in bulk and that only liquid wastes may be carried for the purposeof incineration at sea. If and when requests to carry solids are receivedor anticipated, consideration will be given to imposing specific requirementsas needed to address particular hazards associated with carriage and burningof solids.<T3>Section 150.255 Cargo containment system.</T3><T3>Paragraph (d)</T3>_Two commenters recommended that the requirementfor a three-way valve be deleted or revised to accommodate incineratordesigns in which separate fuel and cargo lines lead to each burner. Theintent of the proposed rule was to require use of a three way valve inpiping systems in which both fuel and cargo enter an incinerator burnerthrough the same pipe. The requirement does not apply to systems in whichcargo and fuel enter a burner through separate pipes. The final rules havebeen modified accordingly.<T3>Section 150.270 Vessel Arrangements and andSection; 150.457 Entry ondeck in vicinity of Incinerators.</T3>One commenter recommended that a provision equivalent to IBC andSection;19.3.7 requiring that the incinerator be located outside the external perimeterof the cargo area be included in the rules. This provision was proposedin andSection; 150.270 of the proposed rules and has been retained in finalrules.One comment recommended adding a requirement to provide access to machineryspaces in the aft part of the incinerator vessel without having to walkon deck. The comment addresses a valid safety concern, but an alternative,less expensive solution has been adopted.Operational prohibitions concerning access to the vicinity of the incineratorhave been added in the final rules (see andSection; 150.147) and these prohibitionsshould resolve the safety concerns evident in the commenter's recommendation.<T3>Section 150.295 Cargo venting system.</T3>One commenter recommended that the provisions on cargo venting systemsin IBC Chapter 8 and andSection; 15.12 be included in the final rules. TheseIBC provisions were incorporated into the chemical tanker rules (46 CFRPart 153) in 1977 and have been included in both the proposed and finalrules in this rulemaking at andSection; 150.295.<T3>Paragraph (e)</T3>_One commenter questioned the need to have a Pressure-Vacuum(PV) valve between each tank and the connection to another tank's ventline on an incinerator vessel that only carries compatible wastes. Therequirement for having a PV valve has been retained in the final rules.In addition to providing a safeguard against hazards associated with incompatiblecargoes, the PV valve serves to isolate cargo tanks, one from the other,in the event of fire or explosion.<T3>Paragraph (m)</T3>_One comment stated that high velocity vents shouldnot be fitted with flame arrestors since flame arrestors would slow thespeed of the vented gas thus preventing effective high velocity venting.This comment has been adopted.<T3>Section 150.325 Pumproom respiratory requirements.</T3>One commenter requested that a low pressure air supply system be requiredonly for pumprooms not open to the atmosphere. This comment has not beenadopted. Pumprooms are by definition closed spaces (see <T3>e.g.,</T3> 46 CFR 153.2, and the definition of ``cargo handling space''in andSection; 150.205 of these rules) and access to a low pressure air supplyis essential to allow sustained work in those spaces. The same commenteralso questioned the need for requiring enclosed spaces for cargo pumps.The requirement for having enclosed pumprooms applies to all tank vessels(see 46 CFR 32.60-20) and is necessary to isolate the pumps from sourcesof vapor ignition.<T3>Sections 150.330-150.382 Incinerators and Controls</T3>One commenter urged that the proposed rules relating to incinerator andsystem design should be made more stringent and comprehensive because ofanticipated full flow rates being in the 1600-5500 gallon per hour rangein lieu of the 3 gallons per hour range contemplated by the regulationsfor boilers and other vital systems in proposed 46 CFR Part 62 (upon whichmany of the requirements in proposed andSection;andSection; 150.330-150.385were based). The regulations in proposed Part 62 are derived from requirementsapplicable to propulsion boiler systems also having fuel rates in the rangeof 1600-5500 gallons per hour. These requirements are considered to beadequate to address safety concerns associated with fuel flow rates inanticipated incinerator designs.<T3>Section 150.330 Incinerator construction.</T3>One commenter recommended that the rules also should include specific requirementsfor incinerators relating to design features which may affect the safetyof shipboard personnel resulting from accidental spills, explosions, andemissions including, e.g., requirements concerning furnace design, operatingconditions, combustion chamber geometry, etc. This recommendation has notbeen adopted. Imposing design restrictions for incinerators would inhibitinnovation in this developing field. Further, all known incinerators thatcan be adopted for shipboard use are considered to be adequate for suchuse.Two commenters questioned the reason for the outside surface temperaturelimit of 180anddegrees;C(356anddegrees;F). These comments noted that andSection;19.4.4 of the IMO IBC provides that the temperature rise should not adverselyaffect personnel safety and that the 180anddegrees;C temperature was toohigh to prevent personnel injury.This 180anddegrees;C temperature requirement is provided as a structuralfire protection measure. As provided in Subchapter D, 180anddegrees;C isthe temperature used to test the structural integrity of Class ``A'' bulkheads.However, the Coast Guard agrees that this requirement alone is not sufficientto prevent personnel injury. Accordingly, a requirement for a guard railingor protective screen to protect the crew from the external surface of theincinerator has been added to andSection; 150.330. Additionally, an operatingrequirement has been added as andSection; 150.457 which prescribes limitationson when personnel are allowed on deck in the aft part of the vessel duringburning.Section 150.335 Incinerator control and monitoring: general.<T3>Paragraph (f)</T3>_One commenter noted that the proposal did not includethe proposed requirements as set out in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of September 23, 1985, at proposed andSection;62.25-30(a) for controls, alarms, and monitoring equipment to be used onall types of inspected vessels. This omission was inadvertent and the proposedandSection; 62.25-30(a) has been included in this paragraph of the finalrules.<T3>Paragraph (i)</T3>_One commenter questioned the need to have back-upvalves, i.e. master valves. This requirement has been retained as the back-upcapability is considered to be a critical safeguard to allow for the immediateshutdown of whole systems during an emergency.Section 150.350 Programming control.<T3>Paragraph (b)</T3>_One commenter noted that the 25% maximum air flowduring light off requirement would extinguish the flame during light off.The intent of this requirement was to provide an air-rich combustion chamberatmosphere. This comment has been adopted and paragraph (b) has been revisedaccordingly.Section 150.370 Ventilation of cargo handling spaces, incinerator spacesand incinerator blower spaces.<T3>Paragraph (c)</T3>_One commenter recommended that design or operatingrequirements be added to address hazards involved in the event of ventilationsystem failure. This comment has not been adopted. Section 150.365 requiresthat operating instructions include emergency instructions which wouldcover precautions involved in the event of such failures. Further requiredprecautions are not considered necessary and are not required for othertypes of tank vessels.Section 150.390 Emergency shutdown stations.<T3>Paragraph (b)</T3>_Two commenters recommended that the first of thetwo emergency shutdown stations required by this section not be on theweatherdeck in the cargo area since personnel are seldom there during incineratoroperation. One of the commenters also recommended that the location bechanged to the bridge. Section 150.390 (b) has been revised in the finalrules in accordance with these recommendations to require one of the emergencyshutdown stations to be on the bridge. This requirement is also in IMOIBC andSection; 19.5.4.Section 150.395 Personnel emergency and safety equipment.<T3>Paragraph (a)(2)</T3>_One commenter recommended that only 2 self-containedbreathing apparatus (SCBA's) be required rather than 3, and that the 30minute capacity for SCBA's be reduced. In support, the commenter suggestedthat the third apparatus is unnecessary since they are typically used inpairs with one person entering the dangerous situation while the otherremains on standby. These comments have not been adopted. The regulationsfor chemical tankers (see 46 CFR 153.214(a) and (b)) require three SCBA'swith 30 minute capacity and the IMO IBC, at andSection;andSection; 14.2 and19.3.1, for incinerator vessels, likewise require 3 SCBA's with sufficientbreathing capacity to deal with an emergency situation for at least 20minutes, which necessarily presupposes the additional time needed, <T3>i.e., </T3>10 minutes, to activate and deactivate the apparatus beforeentering and after departing the emergency situation.<T3>Paragraph (g)(1)</T3>_Three commenters questioned the provision forthe emergency escape breathing apparatus (EEBA). Two of the comments urgedadoption of the IMO IBC requirement to require at least a 15 minute airsupply and the third comment suggested that the requirement to provideone EEBA per crew member was excessive. One commenter also suggested thatthe air supply be of sufficient duration for use in an abandon ship situation.The IMO requirement for a 15 minute air supply has been adopted in thefinal rules. A requirement to have a longer air supply would entail useof bulky equipment which would substantially impair the wearer's abilityto move in exiting the vessel or survive in the water in an abandon ship/survivalsituation. The intent of the rule is to provide an emergency supply inthe event of a momentary blow-back or similar air-starvation situation.The requirement to have one EEBA per person is an IMO requirement and hasbeen retained in the final rules. The EEBA is an important safety devicewhich has also been required for several years on chemical tankers thatcarry hazardous substances which emit toxic vapors.Section 150.442 Incinerator Stack Emissions and andSection; 150.457 Entryon deck in vicinity of incinerators.One commenter recommended that the rules include requirements on stackpositioning and other design requirements that take into account the effectof combustion gases on air intakes, personnel work areas, and openingsto these spaces, as provided in andSection; 19.3.8 of the IMO IBC. TheseIMO IBC requirements have been incorporated into various provisions ofthe proposed and final rules. Section 150.270(b) contains specific requirementson placement of air intakes, as well as openings to accommodation spacesand service and machinery spaces, which take into account the effects ofcombustion gases on vessel personnel. Additional safeguards are also addressedin andSection; 150.270(j), which requires stack positioning to be specificallyapproved by the Commandant, and in andSection; 150.457, as added in the finalrules, which contains operational prohibitions against entry on deck duringincinerator operations.Section 150.450 Eye Protection.Paragraph (a)(2)_One commenter recommended that the requirement in andSection;150.450(a)(2) to wear tight-fitting goggles for eye protection while transferringcargo be deleted. This comment has not been adopted. The requirement towear goggles while transferring cargo, as well as while sampling cargo,opening a cargo tank, and making or breaking a cargo hose connection, hasbeen in effect since 1977 and applied to transfers of all types of hazardouscargoes regulated under 46 CFR Subchapters D and O. This requirement isconsidered a basic, essential safety measure and is being retained in thefinal rules.Section 157.507 Discharges.Subsequent to the publication of the NPRM in this rulemaking, the IMO MarineEnvironmental Protection Committee (MEPC) issued an ``Interpretation ofAnnex II of MAPROL 73/76 in respect of Incinerator Ships, MEPC 23/22.''MEPC 23/22 classifies all incinerator cargo as Category A Noxious LiquidSubstances (NLS's) and prohibits disposal of these cargoes from an incineratorvessel other than by means of incineration at sea or to an adequate receptionfacility. These MEPC provisions in effect impose an absolute prohibitionagainst overboard discharges from incinerator vessels.The Coast Guard recently published final regulations in 46 CFR Part 153to implement the provisions of ANNEX II. See the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of March 12, 1987 beginning at page 7744 (52FR 7444-7801). These regulations were generally made applicable to incineratorvessels but did not include specific implementation of the MEPC 23/22 interpretationsand did not add specific provisions to the regulations for incineratorvessels in this rulemaking. One commenter to the Part 153 NPRM recommendedthat the Coast Guard incorporate the provisions of the MEPC 23/22 interpretations.This comment has been adopted in these final rules.To implement Annex II and MEPC 23/22 for incinerator vessels, andSection;150.255, in both proposed and final rules, prohibits piping connectingany cargo piping to sea valves, <T3>i.e., </T3>to discharge points to the sea, and andSection; 150.507, asadded to the final rules, imposes an obligation on the master to ensureagainst operational discharges of cargoes and cargo residues overboardto the sea. These provisions taken together adopt and clearly reinforcethe international mandate to prohibit all overboard discharges from incineratorvessels.Annex II and the implementing regulations in Part 153 include numerousrequirements for vessels carrying Category A NLS cargoes. Specific provisionsinclude requiring prewashing of cargo tanks before allowing overboard discharges,as well as requirements for a Cargo Record Book, a Procedures and ArrangementsManual, and use of a surveyor.Because of the provisions of MEPC 23/22, however, none of those provisionsapply or are needed for incinerator vessels. Accordingly, Part 153 hasbeen revised to exclude incinerator vessels from its application and tomake specific reference to the incinerator vessel regulations in this rulemaking(46 CFR Part 150). More specifically, the prewashing provisions in AnnexII do not apply since incinerator vessels can not discharge wastes overboard.The remaining provisions in Annex II are not needed since they are alreadyincluded in the proposed rules of the EPA or the Coast Guard. EPA's proposedandSection; 234.60 (Monitoring and record requirements) and andSection; 234.62(Shiprider requirement) (50 FR 8268-8270) and andSection; 150.430 (Shippingdocuments and Cargo Information) in these rules are equivalent to the surveyor,Cargo Record Book and Procedures and Arrangements Manual provisions inAnnex II. Also, MEPC 23/22 expressly authorizes adoption of modified provisionsin lieu of specific Annex II requirements to reflect specialized operationsof incinerator vessels.<ITAG tagnum="84">Final Regulatory Evaluation</ITAG>These regulations are considered to be non-major under Executive Order12291 and significant under Department of Transportation regulatory policiesand procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). A regulatory evaluationhas been prepared and placed in the rulemaking docket. It may be inspectedand copied at the address listed above under <T2>ADDRESSES.</T2> Copies may also be obtained by contacting the personlisted under <T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT.</T2>The evaluation provides a detailed explanation of the estimated costs ofthese regulations. The estimated costs for new construction are approximately$3 million per vessel with an expectation of a maximum of 3 incineratorvessels being built per year for the next 10-11 years. These costs takeinto account a potential savings to prospective shipowners of as greatas $1 million per vessel over the $4 million cost per vessel required tomeet current Coast Guard conditions for certification as an incineratorvessel. The savings will result from reducing the time needed for CoastGuard concept plan review in the certification process. The savings wouldbe considerably reduced if several vessels were built to the same plans;however, this is not the usual practice.Due to a lack of operational experience for incinerator vessels, it wasnot possible to quantify the extent to which these regulations affect therisk of explosion and fire aboard ships during the incineration processand the potential for exposure of the crew to toxic wastes. However, allknown hazards are addressed by these regulations and the risks should beminimal.These regulations, in conjunction with the EPA permit requirements as proposedin EPA docket FRL-2698-5, should result in an essentially negligible potentialfor harmful releases affecting coastal areas as a consequence of a vesselcasualty. Based upon the information in the Final evaluation, the CoastGuard certifies that these rules will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>This rulemaking includes information collection requirements that havealready been approved for all chemical tank vessels. These requirementsare in andSection; 150.225(b) and (e), andSection; 150.235(b), andSection; 150.240(b),andSection; 150.365(a), andSection; 150.415, andSection; 150.430, andSection; 150.435,and andSection; 150.480 and are approved under OMB Approval No. 2115-0089.Other information collection requirements are in andSection; 150.460 approvedunder OMB Approval No. 2115-0071, andSection; 150.550 under OMB ApprovalNo. 2115-0518, 150.365(b) under OMB Approval No. 2115-0548, and andSection;andSection;150.490 and 150.505 are approved under OMB Approval No. 2115-0078.The information collection requirements in this rulemaking and their correspondingcontrol numbers will be listed in 46 CFR andSection; 150.105 concurrentlywith the publication of final rules.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 46 CFR Parts 150 and 153</ITAG>Hazardous materials transportation, Marine safety, Incinerator vessels,Incorporation by reference.In accordance with the foregoing, Title 46 of the Code of Federal Regulations,Chapter I, Parts 150 and 153 are amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 150_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
