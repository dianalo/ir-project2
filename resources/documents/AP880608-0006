Michael Dukakis drew Reagan Democrats backto the fold in the California and New Jersey primaries Tuesday,garnering support from a voting group whose choice will be criticalin the general election.   About a quarter of the voters in the two primaries said they hadbacked President Reagan in 1984, and nearly two-thirds of them saidthis year they would favor Dukakis over George Bush, CBS News-NewYork Times polls said.   A Los Angeles Times exit poll of Republicans in Californiacontained other good news for Dukakis: only about a third of theRepublican voters viewed him unfavorably, far fewer than usual for acandidate of the opposing party.   Also, a sizable share of Democratic opponent Jesse Jackson'svoters viewed Dukakis favorably, an indication that Dukakis will beable to win them over with relative ease, said Los Angeles Timespollster I.A. Lewis.   In the 1984 and 1980 Democratic primaries in California,supporters of the losers were far more antagonistic toward thewinners, Lewis noted. ``Jackson voters are not unfavorable toDukakis,'' he said. ``So it won't be so hard for them to bind uptheir wounds.''   On the other side of the country, exit polls of New Jersey voterssaid more Democrats considered Dukakis to be a strong andexperienced leader than in earlier contests, and more said theysupported him strongly.   His strength of support was not as great in California, accordingto preliminary poll results. But Dukakis' voters still valued hisexperience and leadership more than generally was the case inearlier races.   The polls in California indicated that Dukakis and Jackson splitthe liberal vote, a large segment of the Democratic electoratethere, while Dukakis won among moderates and conservative Democrats.   The polls said Jackson won about a quarter of the white vote inCalifornia _ one of his best showings among whites _ but only 9percent in New Jersey, one of his worst showings with whites. He gotmore than 90 percent of the black vote in both states.   ABC News poll results from New Jersey said Dukakis continued toappeal to Democrats across the ideological spectrum. He wonmajorities of liberals, moderates and conservatives, and 56 percentof all Democrats said his views were ``just about right'' as opposedto too liberal or too conservative.   In both California and New Jersey, about a quarter of Democraticvoters said they were not sure of Dukakis' ideology, less than inearlier races but still an indication he was somewhat ill-defined,said John Brennan, an ABC poll analyst. Still, Brennan noted, smallminorities of voters thought Dukakis too liberal or too conservative.   That broad ideological appeal could be double-edged, Brennansaid: ``It's an indication he's run a moderate campaign. It alsoindicates people haven't scrutinized him closely. He's all things toall people.''   The CBS-Times poll found that 54 percent of the Dukakis voters inNew Jersey supported him strongly, up from most earlier races. Whenasked the most important qualities they considered, 43 percent saidexperience and 41 percent cited strong leadership _ also increasesfrom earlier contests.   In California, roughly half of the Dukakis voters had somereservations about him, and fewer said they were strongly for him.Still, experience and strong leadership were most often cited asreasons for backing him.   The strength of Dukakis' support in New Jersey ``could stem fromthe fact that he's on a roll. He's got momentum'' from a string ofprimary victories, said CBS News poll analyst Keating Holland. Italso could reflect a regional bias for a fellow Northeasterner, hesaid.   Although the electorate was racially polarized, 70 percent ofJackson's New Jersey supporters told ABC they would vote for Dukakisover Bush in November, while just 7 percent took Bush and 22 percentsaid they would not vote. And while most Jackson voters wanted himto be the vice presidential nominee, a slight majority in NewJersey, 54 percent, said the choice should be left up to thepresidential nominee, ABC reported.   ABC's polls had a margin of sampling error of five percentagepoints; the CBS-Times poll had a four-point margin, NBC's, 2 points.</TEXT></DOC>
