Our &quot;fate&quot; will, in largest part,be the product of the myriad discrete choices we make, as individualsand as society: as individuals, the choices include the cars we purchase,buildings we construct, appliances we choose to own; as a society, thechoices include the tax and tariff measures, and our myriad regulatorychoices. Crucial decisions are now on the table. We can opt for measuresthat would serve the short-term selfish needs of a small number of vestedinterests - at great cost, and even great peril, to the nation.
