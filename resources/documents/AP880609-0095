Bishop Jin Luxian of Shanghai called for early negotiationsbetween China and the Vatican to improve their relationship. TheChinese Catholic church broke ties with the Roman Catholic Churchin 1957.   During a recess in an international conference on Confucianismand Christianity, Jin invited Roman Catholic Archbishop Lo Kuang tovisit China, which the Taiwan prelate left 58 years ago.   Lo told reporters his health would not permit him to visit themainland. The Nationalist Chinese fled to Taiwan in 1949 afterlosing a civil war to the Communists.   Jin said he conferred for an hour with Lo after arriving herefrom China on Wednesday. He said they talked about the Catholicchurch on the mainland and in Taiwan.   Jin said he first met Lo in 1948 when he was studying in Romeand Lo was the Chinese Nationalist Party's representative at theVatican.   China's breakaway Catholic Church claims 3 million members. Anunknown number of other Catholics remain secretly loyal to thePope, and several are imprisoned for their religious beliefs.   Jin said the last two imprisoned priests, Zhu Weifang fromZhejiang province and Chen Tianxiang from Jiangxi province, will bereleased soon. He gave no other details.   Referring to ties between Beijing and the Vatican, Jin saidnothing can be solved without negotiations.   The Shanghai Bishop said he had also invited the newly-elevatedCardinal of Hong Kong, John Baptist Wu, to China.   Wu was named cardinal on May 29 by the pope. Vatican officialsdescribed the appointment as especially significant because HongKong will revert to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.   More than 70 scholars and religious leaders from North American,Europe and Asia are attending the week-long conference in Hong Kong.</TEXT></DOC>
