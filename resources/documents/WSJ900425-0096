After days of debate within the administration aboutwhether to cancel talks with the Soviets on economic issues,Mr. Bush said he still wants to avoid steps that mightprovoke a Kremlin backlash and scuttle chances for anegotiated end to the Lithuanian standoff. Mr. Bush notedthat a Lithuanian delegation is visiting Moscow, and he saidhe didn't want to do anything that might reduce its chancesof persuading the Kremlin to open talks.</LP><TEXT>   He also indicated his worry that imposing sanctions nowmight imperil progress already made in pulling Eastern Europeout of the Soviet grip. &quot;I'm concerned that we notinadvertently do something that compels the Soviet Union totake action that would set back the whole case of freedomaround the world,&quot; Mr. Bush told reporters.   The president's decision means negotiations with theSoviets in Paris on a broad new trade treaty, as well astalks on a civil aviation agreement, will proceed asscheduled this week, the White House said.   Though the overriding reason for Mr. Bush's decisionappears to be his fear of undermining negotiations overLithuania, a widespread distaste for sanctions among U.S.allies was a factor as well. Mr. Bush himself has been hopingall along to avoid imposing sanctions for fear that mightspoil the climate for closing big arms-reduction deals withthe Soviets. European allies apparently have reinforced thatfeeling by voicing similar concerns in consultations with theWhite House over the last few days.   &quot;Our allies aren't prepared to join in on any sanctions,and under those circumstances I am not sure that I wouldrecommend unilateral sanctions,&quot; said Rep. Dante Fascell (D.,Fla.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, aftera meeting with Mr. Bush yesterday.   Some allies are worried that the problems facing SovietPresident Mikhail Gorbachev at the moment are so acute thatU.S. sanctions might be a serious blow to his regime, asenior administration aide said. U.S. analysts don't thinkMr. Gorbachev is in such dire straits, the official said, butagree that sanctions might have an especially substantialimpact on him right now.   Mr. Bush and his aides insist that the administrationcould reverse its position at any time and choose to imposesanctions. In particular, the senior official said, theywould reconsider sanctions if the Kremlin continues to refuseto open negotiations or further tightens an economic blockadeunder which the Soviets already have cut oil, gas and othersupplies to Lithuania.   Mr. Bush's inclination to avoid acting immediately wasreinforced by a meeting he held yesterday with a delegationof leading congressional Democrats and Republicans, officialssaid. Though some congressional conservatives have beencomplaining about Mr. Bush's failure to lash out at theSoviet Union, both administration aides and lawmakers saidafter the meeting that the lawmakers offered general supportfor Mr. Bush's cautious approach.   Rep. Fascell, for instance, repeated a suggestion he'smade before that Mr. Bush cancel a summit meeting schedulewith Mr. Gorbachev for May 30 to June 4. And Sen. Jesse Helms(R., N.C.) urged Mr. Bush to send a U.S. ambassador toLithuania in recognition of the breakaway republic'sdeclaration of independence.   Overall, though, there was a &quot;general feeling of support&quot;for Mr. Bush, said Sen. Claiborne Pell (D., R.I.), chairmanof the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   Still, some signs of brewing unrest in Congress areemerging. Sen. Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.), chairman of thepowerful Appropriations Committee, declared Sunday in aSenate speech that he opposes &quot;extending any new economicbenefits to the Soviets so long as they continue to frustratethe legitimate status of Lithuania as an independent nation.&quot;   In addition to the talks on trade and civil aviationagreements, the U.S. also has pledged to support observerstatus for the Soviet Union at the General Agreement onTariffs and Trade, the West's primary trade-regulation body.Officials said withdrawing that support also could be apossible sanction.</TEXT></DOC>
