The Green Bay, Wis., paper products concern previously said only that certain managers had indicated their intention to seek a leveraged buy-out with third parties it didn't identify.    Analysts have said shareholders could receive around $50 a share in a leveraged buy-out, giving the transaction an indicated value of $3.4 billion. Some analysts say the price could be even higher.    In a leveraged buy-out, a company is acquired with funds that are largely borrowed. Ultimately, the debt is repaid with funds generated by the company's operations or the sale of its assets.    The company's shares closed Friday at $50, up $2.50, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. </TEXT></DOC>
