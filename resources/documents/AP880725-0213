Uneasy aboutIsrael-Arab tension nowadays, they tend to keep a low profile.   Most speak only Arabic and dress like the Tunisian peasants whopredominate on the island off Tunisia's southern mainland. Theirforefathers came with Phoenician traders after the destruction ofSolomon's Temple in 586 B.C., more than a millenium before thefoundation of Islam and the Arab invasions of North Africa.   Almost throughout this long history, they have lived among thelocal population in ``harmonious and brotherly coexistence,'' saidHaim Madar, Tunisia's chief rabbi, himself born 55 years ago in aMoorish-style family home in Hara Khebira.   He attributed occasional friction and acts of anti-Jewishvandalism to Arab youths whipped up by events in the Middle East.   ``Israel creates some problems for us,'' he said. ``If it werenot for Israel, we would live here as happily as ever.''   Hai Moussa Haddad, a local Jewish jeweler, said the Arabpopulation is aware the Jews have unspoken emotional and religiouslinks with Israel, which has therefore become ``a politicalembarrassment for those of us who want to remain in Tunisia, theland of our fathers.''   Madar attended a Talmudic school and speaks only Hebrew andTunisian Arabic.   ``We must thank the authorities for all they have done for thesurvival of the Jewish faith in Tunisia,'' he said through aninterpreter. ``We are regarded as an integral part of the Tunisianpeople.''   At the same time, he added, the government makes a distinctionbetween Jews and Zionists, those who try to promote Jewishresettlement in Palestine.   ``The authorities continuously remind Tunisians that a Jew isnot necessarily a Zionist,'' he said. ``Those Jews who decide toleave are free to go anywhere. As for me, I was born here, I belonghere and I am staying here.''   A police station is in the same building as the synagogue innearby Hara Ghriba. Mader said he warmly welcomed the policepresence at the synagogue, visited by hundreds of tourists dailyduring the summer season.   The 116-square-mile island is among Tunisia's main touristcenters.   Painted in blue outside many Jewish homes are symbolic outlinesof menorahs _ the candelabra used in Jewish rites _ combined withfish.   ``They are intended as a protection against the evil eye,''Madar said. ``It is a very ancient custom. Jewish doctrinedisapproves of it, but we don't interfere.''   Every year in May, crowds of Jews come on a pilgrimage fromTunis and elsewhere to commemorate Rabbi Shimon Bar Yuhai, an earlyJewish mystic reputed to have had special links with Jerba.   A marble plaque in the Ghriba synagogue claims, ``This sacredand antique place dates from the destruction of Solomon's firsttemple in 586 before our era.''   In fact, local records indicate the whitewashed building waserected in the 1920's, the latest in a succession of Jewish shrinesbuilt on the same spot over the centuries.   Former President Habib Bourguiba of Tunisia attended Jewishreligious services there in 1966 to mark his respect for thecommunity. The Jews, Bourguiba said, brought ``baraka'' (good luck)to Tunisia.   Despite the official protection, vandals regularly fling garbageover the wall into the four-acre Jewish cemetery in Hara Khebira.Many tombstones engraved with Hebrew inscriptions were deliberatelysmashed years ago.   ``We can do nothing about it,'' Madar said. ``If we clean it up,it will only start again.''   The island's police chief said he had received no complaints ofanti-Jewish violence or vandalism. The police chief, who cannot beidentified by name under government regulations, said it was a``very sensitive subject, a political rather than a police matter.''   One Jewish resident requesting anonymity said complaints onlygenerate more friction.   ``We generally live in peace here as long as we keep quiet aboutthose who don't like us.''   During the 1967 Middle East war, Tunisian rioters burned downthe main synagogue in Tunis, 400 miles to the north. Theringleaders were punished and the government paid for restorationof the building.   Most of Tunisia's Jews live in Tunis, but they are involved inthe capital's modern life and are ``rapidly losing their faith,''Madar said. ``Only in Jerba is our religion intact. Jews here neversmoke or drink on the Sabbath. Their children, like mine, attendreligious schools.''   Like many of the men in Hara Khebira, Madar was temporarilyunshaven in ritual mourning for Solomon's Temple.   Jews enjoyed official protection throughout the five centuriesof Turkish, Spanish and French domination. When French colonialrule ended in 1956, some 120,000 Jews lived in Tunisia. Many hadacquired French citizenship.   Newly independent Tunisia backed the Arab cause in the MiddleEast, leading to a massive exodus of the nation's Jewish minorityto Israel and France. Madar said Tunisia now has only 2,700 Jewishresidents, 900 of them in Jerba.   Tunisian Jews are often craftsmen, tailors, butchers orjewelers. Madar said only one has qualified as an engineer. ManyJews are active in the tourist industry. Very few are wealthy.   But several members of a prominent Italian Jewish family namedPariente have elaborate tombs in the Hara Khebira cemetery. Madarsaid the family contributed substantially to the upkeep of Jerba'ssynagogues.   The patriarch, Guido Pariente, died in l954. His tomb has beendesecrated and partly destroyed.   Undisturbed nearby are the fresh tombs of Madar's mother andfather.   As he passed, Madar knelt down in the burning sun and kissed hisparents' tombstones engraved with Hebrew inscriptions.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Thurs AMs Aug. 4 or Thereafter</NOTE></DOC>
