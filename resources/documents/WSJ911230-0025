According to reports from several analysts andtoy-industry officials, Sega Enterprises Ltd.'s Genesis videogames outsold Nintendo's new Super Nintendo series during thecrucial Christmas buying season by a wide margin, especiallyin stores that carry both systems.</LP><TEXT>   Although Nintendo retains a comfortable lead in totalvideo-game sales in the U.S., the Christmas performanceindicates that the longtime leader may have failed in its bidto come up with a dominant system that employs the latesttechnology. Both Genesis and Super Nintendo have 16 bits ofcomputer memory, compared with the eight bits used in earliergenerations of games. The games are sold on cartridges thatplug into a game-player, which in turn is plugged into atelevision set. The game is viewed and played on the TV.   The numbers also underscore the increasingly hot rivalrybetween Sega and Nintendo, which could mean future pricingpressures as the two Japanese concerns vie for sales in whatmay be a shrinking or stagnant market.   Nintendo, entering the more advanced video game marketthis fall -- two years after Sega -- thought it could lurenew fans by including the fourth version of its popular SuperMario game with its $199 Super Nintendo system. But the $149Genesis, which features a popular game called Sonic theHedgehog, outsold Super Nintendo by about two-to-one in thelast week before Christmas, says John Taylor, an analyst forL.H. Alton andamp; Co. in San Francisco, who says he has surveyedmany retailers.   The sales lag comes despite a $25 million advertisingblitz by Nintendo, two and a half times what Sega spentpromoting Genesis since Nintendo's introduction.   &quot;There's no question Sega is beating the dickens out ofNintendo,&quot; says Thomas Kully, analyst for William Blair andamp; Co.in Chicago. &quot;Sonic is the most exciting game since SuperMario III.&quot;   Nintendo, which has set 2.2 million Super Nintendo unitsas its 1991 sales goal, maintains that consumers will buy&quot;more than two million units&quot; by year's end. A Nintendospokesman, William White, said, &quot;We are pleased with oursales, given the poor retail environment.&quot; But a number ofretailers and analysts quarrel with the estimate of more thantwo million units. Mr. Kully of William Blair figures only1.2 million Super Nintendo units will be sold this year.   &quot;I don't see how Nintendo can possibly achieve itsnumbers,&quot; adds Mr. Taylor.   Sega contends that it will sell 1.6 million Genesis unitsin 1991 and that its Christmas sales have exceededexpectations. For instance, Thomas Kalinske, president ofSega's U.S. unit, says in the final week before ChristmasGenesis outsold Super Nintendo by an average of 2.5 to one atToys &quot;R&quot; Us Inc. outlets, by 4.6 to one at Babbage's Inc. andby 1.8 to one at KayBee Toy andamp; Hobby, a Melville Corp. unit.Babbage's president, Gary Kusin, said he &quot;had no trouble&quot;with the accuracy of the estimate for its stores. Toys &quot;R&quot; Usdeclined comment. The other ratios were corroborated byanalysts who have surveyed retailers and asked not to benamed.   Nintendo didn't dispute Mr. Kalinske's numbers. However,Mr. White added that based on October sales, the latestpublished figures, and from checking with retailers from timeto time since then, Nintendo will sell twice as many 16-bitsystems as Sega when the full-year tallies are done.   The next few months will be a critical period for bothSega and Nintendo as they battle for market share, analystssay. Twice magazine, a consumer electronics publication,estimates that Nintendo had 70% of the $4 billion U.S videogames market in 1991, vs. 20% for Sega and 10% for others.Those figures include sales of previous-generation machinesand software, and handheld games.   Not wanting to break its momentum, Sega says it issupplying retailers by air, despite the added expense. &quot;Idon't want to give up any sales to Nintendo,&quot; says Mr.Kalinske, noting that it takes 11 days to ship products bysea.   In 1992, Sega plans to go after the core of the video gameplaying market -- children eight to 12 years old -- aNintendo stronghold in older systems. Until now Sega hasdirected more than two thirds of its advertising towardadults and teenagers, who have purchased most of the Genesissystems. But Mr. Kalinske says the company plans to spendnearly half its $40 million advertising budget in 1992promoting Genesis on childrens' TV and in childrens'magazines.   Nintendo says it plans to &quot;significantly&quot; increase its1992 advertising budget but won't know by how much untilafter the Consumer Electronic Show next month in Las Vegas.Typically, such trade shows are good for gauging retailerinterest in new products.   &quot;I think 1992 is going to be a watershed year,&quot; says L.H.Alton's Mr. Taylor. &quot;It marks an important juncture forNintendo, which must find a way of stopping Sega's momentum.&quot;   For starters, analysts suggest, Nintendo must lower its$199 price tag on the Super Nintendo by at least $30 tocompete with the cheaper Genesis system. More importantly,they say, Nintendo must also improve the quality of games andput more of them on the market. Sega currently has 159 gamescompared with Nintendo's 25. Nintendo, which hasn't made agame for its old system since August, has stepped upproduction on Super Nintendo games hoping to market another50 Super Nintendo games by June.   How good the games will be is debatable. &quot;It takes a goodyear for a programmer to understand the nuances of amachine,&quot; says William Blair's Mr. Kully, adding that itwould be difficult for Nintendo to come up with excitingselections before next fall because of its relatively lateentry.   Nintendo concedes it has stumbled somewhat in developinggames for the 16-bit system, but Mr. White noted thatNintendo software developers are well on their way toimproving their games.   Both the Super Nintendo and Genesis systems are based onsimilar microchip technologies. The Nintendo machine candisplay 256 colors on a screen compared with only 64 colorsfor Genesis. But Genesis uses its computing power to makecharacters move more quickly on a screen -- an advantage thathelps Sega sports games like Joe Montana and John Maddenfootball.   Speed is the main Genesis attraction for James Shaunessey,18, of San Mateo, Calif, a sports video-game afficionado. Hesays he has played games on both systems. &quot;Let me put it thisway,&quot; he says, &quot;Genesis makes me forget girls for a while;with the Super NES, I'm still thinking about them.&quot;   Sonic the Hedgehog also has fans. The game is similar inconcept to the Super Mario game, with multiple levels ofchallenges. Sonic, a hairy blue porcupine, moves from stratato strata of video strife doing flips, scaling bridges andscooting through tunnels.   Not everyone agrees. Steven Worthington, another Babbage'spatron, has been in the Super Nintendo camp sinceThanksgiving, when he played it at a friend's house. &quot;I thinkwith Nintendo the games can get really complicated, which Ilike.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
