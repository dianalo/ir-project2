Clinical indications for the examinationsincluded 205 patients with suspected peripheral vascular diseases, 147with suspected neurovascular diseases, 57 with tumor or tumor-like lesionsof various organs and 4 with other diseases. Quality of total 1773 digitalfluorography (DF) images (1182 non-selective and 591 selective injectionsof the contrast material) were categorized into four grades; grade A(clinically adequate study with excellent images), grade B (adequateor nearly adequte), grade C (inadequate), and grade D (useless). GradeA and B images consisted 53 % and 41 % of the non-selective injectionstudies respectively, and consisted 76 % and 23 % of the selective injectionstudies respectively. Both grade-A and B images were considered clinicallyacceptable, so this result suggests the usefulness of this angiographicalapproach. Then, 98 images obtained with computed radiography (CR) methodwere compared with DF images and CR was superior to DF in most of thecases. Degree of the angiospasm at the brachial catheterization siteswas estimated using IADSA. The incidence of severe spasm was rather high(20 %) in the early cases, and the most of these were seen in youngerpatients especially in females. Incidence of angiospasm decreased significantlyafter limitation of this approach to the younger group. Topical use ofwater-soluble nitroglycerin was effective in 50 % of the 22 patients.But, its clinical usefulness remains for further evaluatons. There wereno patients who suffered long-term complications. (J.P.N.).</TEXT></DOC>
