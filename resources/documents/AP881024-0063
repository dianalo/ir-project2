An in-house EPA committee report to Administrator Lee M. Thomassuggests that the agency and state governments might have toconsider new ways to help those affected by some 85 major rulesinvolving everything from pesticide use to controls on dry cleaningsolvents.   The committee made no attempt to assess the benefits of theregulations, but cautioned they must not be ignored.   It suggested that federal, state and local governments consider,among other things, ``public education'' as one helpful tactic.   ``Making people aware of the potential net benefits to be gainedby investing in environmental protection should provide a betterforum for assessing the merits of the project,'' the committeewrote.   It said the agency may need to encourage other tactics such asmore technical assistance, changes in fee structures, grants toparticularly poor communities and incentives to cooperate withothers, as in regional water systems embracing several communities.   Warning that cost estimates couldn't be derived for severalimportant regulations such as asbestos control in schools, thestudy said the average household nationwide by 1996 might have topay $100 a year more in charges, fees and taxes because ofregulations on drinking water, waste water treatment and solidwaste disposal.   The cost was greater at the extremes _ an average of $170 morein communities under 2,500 residents and $160 in communities of atleast 250,000.   In 20 percent of the smaller places, current charges could morethan double, but nationwide only 2 percent of the households wouldsee an increase that large.   People living in smaller communities generally have lowerincomes, and the study estimated current and future costs for theseenvironmental services could total 0.7 percent of household incomefor towns of fewer than 2,500 people compared with 0.5 percent forlarger places.   Based on the finances of a sample of 207 municipalities, thestudy estimated that 21 percent to 30 percent of communities offewer than 2,500 people could have trouble financing capitalexpenditures the regulations are expected to require. Only 3percent to 7 percent of larger communities were expected to havesimilar problems.   No such sample was possible for farms, so the committee examinedthe books of typical farms in ``average'' and ``vulnerable''financial conditions for thee types of operations _ an Illinoiscorn and soybean operation, of which there are about 31,000; aMississippi farm growing cotton and soybeans, of which there areabout 1,800; and a Kansas farm producing wheat and cattle, of whichthere are about 20,000.   Assuming that the agency tried to promulgate regulations withminimum costs and that not every farmer in average financialcondition had to meet every requirement _ a kind of ``averageimpact'' scenario _ income before depreciation would fall by 3percent for the Mississippi and Kansas farms and by 0.7 percent forthe Illinois farm.   If all such farms had to meet all requirements, income wouldfall by 8 percent for the Illinois farm, 18 percent for theMississippi farm and 24 percent for the Kansas farm.   In the worst case, EPA would promulgate regulations bearingheavy costs that all farmers would have to meet _ a highlyimprobable upper bound, since only a few farms would be so heavilyaffected. The Illinois farm would lose 26 percent of its income,the Mississippi farm would lose 24 percent and the Kansas farmwould lose 84 percent.   A ``vulnerable'' Kansas farm with current negative net cashincome will go out of business in 1996 anyway, but a year earlierunder some possible scenarios, the report said.   The committee also examined a few speciality crops and concludedthat even ``average impact'' fungicide restrictions could havedramatic effects on apple growers in Michigan and New York, but notWashington state.   If the agency goes all-out with high-cost regulations, New Yorkgrowers could see a drop of 60 percent in their current $220 netreturn per acre, and Michigan growers could lose 84 percent oftheir $80 per acre. Washington returns would barely change from$330, increasing by 0.2 percent because apple prices would rise.   Relatively few non-farm small businesses will be affected byEPA's regulations. Seventy percent of the nation's 3.5 smallbusinesses _ those with fewer than 50 employees _ are innon-polluting fields such as wholesale and retail trade, finance orother services.   But the committee said it was able to identify severalindustries where costs to comply with future regulations had a goodchance of eating up either 30 percent of annual profits orrequiring capital expenditures of more than 30 percent of theowners' investment.   Most prominent are dry cleaners, who may be faced with expensivecontrols on solvent emissions, and service stations, where ``onlythe strongest'' financially would be able to meet costs of cleaningup any leaking underground storage tanks.   Small electroplaters, wood preservers and pesticide formulatorscould have difficulty meeting toxic chemical regulations. If theyhave leaking underground tanks, farm supply stores and truckingcompanies also could be vulnerable.</TEXT></DOC>
