In releasing the findings of the department's six-week review of Texas Air, Transportation Secretary James Burnley said Eastern's intramural conflicts represent an &quot;unprecedented level of hostility for an airline.&quot; Mr. Burnley also said he has asked former Labor Secretary William Brock to begin talks with both sides to try to ensure that conflicts over economic issues don't hurt safety practices.    Texas Air officials hailed the department's report, while the head of an Eastern union called it &quot;a whitewash.&quot;    At a news conference in Washington jammed with reporters and lobbyists, Mr. Burnley described Eastern as &quot;a safe carrier,&quot; but stressed that &quot;there is an atmospheric condition pervasive at all levels that gives us cause for concern.&quot;    A Federal Aviation Administration report prepared for Mr. Burnley said both labor and management at Eastern behave as though they are &quot;at war,&quot; producing a &quot;corporate cultural problem&quot; that sometimes prevents the airline from complying totally with federal safety rules.    The report said, &quot;In a company so divided, the risk is increased that the labor-management discord will, at some time, either through inattention or design, have an adverse impact on public safety.&quot;    Other than that, the department's findings on Houston-based Texas Air -- based on 30-day FAA ramp inspections of Eastern and Continental, hundreds of interviews of employees and thousands of pages of documents -- essentially were good news for the nation's biggest airline company.    On management and financial issues, Mr. Burnley said managers at Eastern and Continental were &quot;experienced professionals&quot; and that there was &quot;no basis for serious concern about management competence.&quot; Despite financial losses last year at both Continental and Eastern, each carrier has substantial assets and access to capital, he said. In addition, the secretary said the department's investigation didn't support concerns that management was selling profitable Eastern assets in an effort &quot;to bleed off&quot; the company, threatening its viability.    At another news conference in Washington, Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo exulted over the department's conclusions that Eastern and Continental are safe. &quot;Both airlines passed inspection with flying colors,&quot; he said . The department report, agreed Eastern President Philip Bakes, should &quot;reassure the flying public.&quot; Both men expressed intense relief that the investigation was over, saying it had exacted a significant financial toll on both Eastern and Continental.    But in Miami, Charles Bryan, head of Eastern's machinists' union, called the report &quot;a whitewash in every sense of the word.&quot; He added, &quot;There is certainly a labor-management problem. But it is a Continental problem and an Eastern problem and a problem with anyone else Lorenzo is involved with.&quot;    In the FAA's report on the ramp safety checks, which ran from mid-April to mid-May, Eastern didn't perform nearly as well as Continental. Of Continental's 350 airplanes, 50, or 14% of the fleet, were temporarily removed from service by the airline at least once because of hydraulic leaks, cracks or other safety problems. At Eastern, 83 of the 280 planes, or nearly 30%, were pulled from service voluntarily because of safety problems. The FAA characterized many of the airlines' problems as minor.    Texas Air's four commuter airlines also were included in the ramp inspections, and 20% of those carriers' planes were temporarily removed from service at least once.    In addition, the FAA found that Eastern has &quot;an ineffective quality assurance program&quot; for its line, or day-to-day, maintenance. It also reported there are some problems with the airline's weighting and balancing of cargo on aircraft, and with its &quot;minimum equipment list&quot; program, which dictates which repairs are done immediately and which ones are delayed.    FAA Administrator Allan McArtor, who appeared at the news conference with Messrs. Burnley and Brock, said Eastern is taking steps to solve the problems. But he said he will keep close tabs on the airline in coming months.    Henry Duffy, president of the Air Line Pilots Association, one of the unions that has been locked in combat with Mr. Lorenzo, said the Eastern problems turned up by the FAA are ones &quot;we told them they'd find.&quot; Asked whether he was satisfied with the report, he was restrained, saying only there needs to be &quot;an ongoing inspection&quot; of Eastern.    The department's conclusions seemed to have something for everyone: for unions, a highlighting of some continuing safety concerns at Eastern; for management, a bottom-line assessment that the carrier is safe.    Both sides welcomed the proposed intervention of Mr. Brock, a longtime, prominent figure in the Republican Party who also has served as senator, U.S. trade representative, and most recently as head of Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole's presidential campaign.    Secretary Burnley said Mr. Brock's mission is to &quot;sit down with both sides and try to calm things somewhat.&quot; His focus will be on safety-related areas rather than on the economic disputes, which have long plagued labor-management relations at Eastern and are being handled by the National Mediation Board.    Mr. Brock said he has had initial contacts with both sides, and that they have indicated &quot;a very serious concern&quot; over the situation and &quot;a desire to see it remedied.&quot; He said he plans to take &quot;the approach of a friend who sees a couple of other friends battling to the advantage of no one.&quot;    Mr. Bryan said he had spoken at length with Mr. Brock Wednesday, but that no meeting has yet been scheduled between the machinists' union head and Texas Air executives. &quot;I'm going into this with optimism,&quot; Mr. Bryan said.    Whether Mr. Brock succeeds at turning down the temperature at Eastern -- something many have failed at in the past -- remains to be seen. Yesterday, Mr. Burnley said he was making &quot;no promises&quot; about Mr. Brock's chances of success.    Publicly, at least, some of the combatants are striking a conciliatory stance. Mr. Lorenzo said he wants to &quot;rebuild bridges that were burned a long time ago, and some that were burned more recently.&quot; Mr. Duffy of the pilots' union said he hoped Mr. Brock's participation could improve relations between employees and management.    Still, many officials of labor and management expect a culture of confrontation to persist at Texas Air. Management is battling for steep wage reductions at Eastern, while Eastern's unions are striving to bring nonunion Continental into their domain.    While Eastern remains in federally supervised mediation with its machinists, the company has also recently begun meeting with its pilots in hopes of obtaining wage concessions under a contract that becomes amendable July 1. Last year, Eastern said it wanted to reduce its total pilot costs to $304 million from $417 million.    &quot;Frankly, the difficult labor relations are going to continue until we have contracts&quot; with the machinists and pilots, a Texas Air executive said yesterday.    Many employees have grown frustrated with the atmosphere of antagonism and uncertainty. Eastern has lost pilots at a rate far exceeding the industry average, and in congressional hearings earlier this year, Eastern executives said the exodus caused some scheduling cutbacks.    And despite the generally positive review by the Transportation Department, the unions and many in Congress say they will keep Texas Air under scrutiny. They plan to pursue a congressional resolution -- which more than half of the House has sponsored -- to require a more in-depth study of the Texas Air empire. </TEXT></DOC>
