In most patients with endocrine-active adrenal disease,CT is the only imaging test needed to establish the correct diagnosis.Adrenal venography with blood sampling may provide important additionalinformation in patients with Conn adenoma. Magnetic resonance imagingand (IMBG) scintigraphy appear to be the best imaging tests for the localizationof multiple or extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas. Inactive adrenal tumorsdetected incidentally are a problem as far as diagnosis is concerned,since inactive adrenal adenomas have to be differentiated from carcinomasand metastases. MRI is rarely helpful in these cases. For patients witha known primary tumor, the authors recommend CT-guided biopsy. In allother cases a follow-up study often reveals that the adrenal tumor detectedis benign.</TEXT></DOC>
