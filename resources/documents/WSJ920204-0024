The group, which also includes Cable andamp; Wireless PLC ofBritain, Telefonica Larga Distancia of Puerto Rico and USSprint Communications Co., a unit of UnitedTelecommunications Inc., said it will spend $17 million onthe system.</LP><TEXT>   The 112-mile undersea cable system -- named Taino-Caribfor the Indians who first inhabited the islands -- will linkPuerto Rico, St. Thomas and Tortola starting this fall, ATandamp;Tsaid.   The cable, which was designed by ATandamp;T Bell Laboratories,is half the diameter of present transoceanic cables and usesno electronic regenerating equipment to boost the signal. Sixpairs of optical fibers run through it and carry signals at arate of 560 million bits a second -- or about 225,000simultaneous phone calls, ATandamp;T said. By comparison, the TAT-9trans-Atlantic system scheduled to begin service March 2 hasthree pairs of fibers and can carry 80,000 phone calls, ATandamp;Tsaid.   The Taino-Carib system will be built by ATandamp;T SubmarineSystems Inc., a unit of ATandamp;T.</TEXT></DOC>
