Thereport examines the energy performances of 'standard' and 'high efficiency'motors together with the ranges of solid state controllers, and the partthey can play in achieving savings. The investigation identified a numberof additional reasons for considering energy conservation investments.These include: (1) electricity costs in general are increasing at a fasterrate than motor prices, (2) in the case studies average motor loadingswere only 64% of full load current, (3) oversizing of motors occurs ona large scale, leading to lower efficiencies and poorer power factorsthan optimum. It has been established that 'efficiency' is rarely a factorconsidered when evaluating motors, but it has been demonstrated thatenergy conservation measures in relation to motor selection can providevery good economic returns along with other benefits. The report concludesthat there is considerable scope for energy savings to be made, and thatthe measures that may be taken to achieve these savings are economicallyviable. Finally recommendations are made for implementation of an energyconservation programme targeted at industrial motor users. 16 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
