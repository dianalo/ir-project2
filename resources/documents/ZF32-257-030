 IBM found it was able to achieve a 40%improvement in quality and that a byproduct was a 10% improvement inproductivity.andP;  Once it could measure quality, it could -- and did -- insertnumeric quality improvements into the business plans.andP;  IBM executives couldevaluate progress -- and they could hold managers responsible for progress inquality.andM;When ITT became interested in software measurement, they &quot;stole&quot; a portion ofthe IBM staff (including Jones) to do it for them.andP;  The experience at ITTparalleled that at IBM: by concentrating on improving quality, they also gotimproved productivity -- but to do so, it was necessary to measure both.andM;&quot;Don't attempt to improve productivity without improving quality first -- youjust propagate the poor quality.&quot;andM;In project management, there are five measurements:andM;1.andP;  sizing -- predicts the volumes of code and paperworkandM;- &quot;That's not terribly difficult.&quot;andM;2.andP;  estimating -- predicts the effort, cost, and schedulesandM;- &quot;For large projects, you can't do it well manually.&quot;andM;- &quot;Thirty-three companies offer [automated] products to do it.andP;  But fewpeople [do it at all].&quot;andM;3.andP;  planning -- predicts schedules and milestonesandM;- &quot;There are 60 project planning tools.andP;  They only work well in the hands ofexpert planners.&quot;andM;4.andP;  tracking -- monitors progress against the plans and estimatesandM;- &quot;It's a national disgrace!andP;  [Most tracking] omits 30% to 70% of the costs!andO;What are usually left out are unpaid overtime, management costs, costsassociated with groups that are only partially involved, and users that areactive participants.&quot;andM;5.andP;  measuring -- reducing status and progress to numericsandM;- There are three products on the market (including the one from theinstructor's company).andM;In project management, there are four types of data:andM;1.andP;  size dataandM;- number of pages (every project includes documentation)andM;- lines of source codeandM;- number of function points (explained later)andM;- number and size of test casesandM;2.andP;  soft dataandM;- skills of staffandM;- working environmentandM;- tools availableandM;- methodologies in useandM;3.andP;  hard dataandM;- staffingandM;- schedulesandM;- effortandM;- costsandM;- milestonesandM;4.andP;  normalized dataandM;- productivityandM;- qualityandM;Which of those must you measure?andP;  All of the above!andM;The cost of doing all that measurement will be about 4% of the total projectcost.andP;  That will be quickly absorbed by the savings in productivity and theimprovements in quality -- which reduces maintenance.andM;CAN COMMENT: Capers interrupted the flow of the class to tell us a tale fromhis days at IBM.andP;  It is well worth repeating:  IBM was having a problem withthe quality of IMS (its original database product).andP;  After carefullymeasuring all the bugs that had been found, they discovered that almost allthe problems came from a small set of modules and all of the damaging modulescome from projects under a single manager.andP;  &quot;That manager was reassigned to aposition where he couldn't do any more damage.&quot;andP;  &quot;Bad managers do bad thingsto companies.&quot;andP;  &quot;If you don't get rid of bad managers, give up all hopes ofimproving quality.&quot;andP;  &quot;Good people leave if their manager is a turkey!&quot;andM;Dear reader, please consider framing those statements in gold.andM;Back to measurements ...andM;He presented a chart that showed the interrelationship of a whole set ofreports:andM;* employee survey report -- measures manager's performance (the employeesknow the turkeys from the eagles!)andM;* user satisfaction survey report -- (the ultimate measure of quality)andM;* defect measurement report -- number, severity, origin, cause, and status ofbugsandM;CAN COMMENT: Careful!andP;  I know of cases where these reports exist but havebeen &quot;manipulated&quot; (that word is more polite than saying &quot;falsified&quot;) toprotect the guilty.andM;* monthly progress reportsandM;* annual productivity reportandM;&quot;If you expect to compete with Japan, it's laughable if you aren't doingthis!&quot;andM;Before beginning a project, you should measure or estimate some basics.andP;  Hereviewed a long list of questions for you to ask yourself.andP;  Sample questions:andM;* Do we have the right people?andP;  Tools?andP;  Methods?andP;  Support?andP;  Environment?andM;* How big will the project be?andP;  How long will the schedule be?andP;  How manypeople will be needed?andP;  how much will it cost?andM;* How many bugs will there be?andP;  How many can you remove?andP;  How many will usersfind?andM;- &quot;If users find too many, they stop using the product and don't find anymore!&quot;andM;* What benefits will derive from this project?andP;  Revenue?andP;  Lower future costs?andO;Ability to compete?andP;  Increased speed of response?andP;  New capabilities?andM;* What risks are involved?andP;  Schedule overrun?andP;  Cost overrun?andP;  Poor qualityproduct?andP;  User dissatisfaction?andP;  Project cancellation?andM;- &quot;The risks are in direct proportion to the size of the project!&quot;andP;  Asproject size increases, so do all the problems!andM;The more you know about the project, the better your ability to estimateaccurately.andP;  (When you know everything, you don't have to estimate anything!)andM;He presented a set of equations.andP;  As you learn some facts about the project,you can derive other facts.andP;  Example: &quot;effort&quot; equals the size divided by theproduction rate.andP;  Calculating that, you can derive the schedule because theschedule equals the effort divided by the &quot;staff.&quot;andM;&quot;Tight schedules tend to make managers behave psychotically!&quot;andM;For much of what followed, he broke &quot;software&quot; into three component-types:andM;1.andP;  information systems (MIS)andM;- 52% of all softwareandM;2.andP;  systems software (more complex)andM;- 26% of all softwareandM;3.andP;  military software (burdened by excessive documentation)andM;- 22% of all softwareandM;The differences among the three affect productivity rates.andP;  The averageproductivity rate -- measured in function points -- is five function pointsper staff month for all software (in the U.S.), but:andM;* 8 per staff month for MIS softwareandM;* 4 per staff month for systems software (because it is more complex)andM;* 3 per staff month for military software (because it is burdened by paperwork)andM;Compare your rate to the appropriate average.andM;A series of graphs showed the affects of project size on project variables:As size increases, staffing, schedule, required effort, paper work, risk offailure, expected enhancements, life expectancy, and defects all increase.andO;The only things to decrease are productivity and the ability to find andremove defects.andP;  (Conclusion: the bigger they are, the harder -- and morefrequently -- they fall!)andO;</TEXT></DOC>
