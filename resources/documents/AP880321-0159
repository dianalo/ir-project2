(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Environmentalists still nagged by thedemise of the last known dusky seaside sparrow plan a final searchof the bird's one-time habitat before writing an epitaph.   A search of the area near Kennedy Space Center had been plannedfor this spring, even though regional officials of the U.S. Fishand Wildlife Service are convinced there are no more duskies.   A final search will be conducted in about a year before thedusky is declared extinct, said John Christian, deputy assistantregional director of the wildlife service in Atlanta.   State and federal officials sponsor the bird-watching expeditionin which volunteers will go through area with binoculars. If noduskies are spotted, the species will be considered extinct.   The last tiny dusky died of old age in June in a speciallydesigned environment on Discovery Island, a Walt Disney Worldzoological park primarily for birds. The last five survivors, allmales, were taken there from their only known wildlife habitat onCape Canaveral several years ago.   They were bred with close cousins, seeking to preserve theirgenes, but they died one by one.   The bird's decline began in the 1940s when mosquito fightersbegan spraying DDT over the St. Johns River Refuge marshlands,ruining the duskies' eggs and insect food supply.   Although they were protected by law, conservationists say thebirds did not have much chance against diking, drainage,land-clearing, highway construction, housing developments,mosquito-control projects and fires.   ``We have laws protecting the species, but not the habitat,''said John Wood, a federal official. ``You can protect the speciesall you want, but if you don't have the habitat, they have no placeto go and won't make it.''   But Christian pointed out that the 5,000-acre St. Johns refugewas purchased for $3 million to protect the dusky.   ``We thought we had enough habitat to sustain them, and then thepopulation just crashed,'' Christian said. ``We will never knowwhat biological mechanism was responsible. Nobody really knows.''   Charles Cook, curator of Discovery Island and a leader in thefight to preserve the dusky genes, said he hoped that someday someof the part-duskies will be released on an experimental basis inthe protected area.   Cook believes there is a chance one or more of the birds mayexist in a remote section of the refuge.   ``Scientists always keep the option open,'' he said. ``Idefinitely feel it is worth looking into, particularly in aperipheral habitat not frequently visited by people.''</TEXT></DOC>
