RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court today refused to becomeinvolved in a bitter divorce dispute between jazz saxophonist StanGetz and his wife of 32 years.   The justices, without comment, rejected arguments by Monica Getzthat New York's divorce law violates the rights of women.   Getz, 63, sued for divorce in 1981, after Mrs. Getz, 56, went tocourt alleging her husband - suffering from alcoholism and drugaddiction - abused her. She sought a court order for family supportpayments and protection against Getz.   The couple later made attempts at reconciliation before thedivorce became final in 1987. A state jury ruled in Getz's favor ingranting the divorce. He had accused his wife of infidelity andtrying to poison him.   Mrs. Getz said her husband had been repeatedly unfaithful andunpredictably violent, but said she stood by him when drugs andalcohol could have cost him his life.   A state judge ruled that Mrs. Getz is entitled to half herhusband's royalties from the beginning of their marriage in 1956 to1981. That ruling was not at issue in the case acted on today.   In her appeal to the Supreme Court, Mrs. Getz said the divorcedecree against her is unfair. She said the case should have beenresolved in New York's family courts rather than by trial courtsthat handle corporate disputes and other matters.   She said the state law favors men by permitting them to wage``legal wars of attrition'' against their wives, who often lackequal financial resources.   Family courts are designed to expedite resolutions of divorcecases and spare the couple excessive legal fees, she said.   Mrs. Getz said she has spent more than $600,000 in legal feesand will be forced to use the proceeds from the couple's mansion inIrvington, N.Y., where she still lives, to pay off the bills.   In a legal brief in her behalf, Mrs. Getz's lawyer, WhitneyNorth Seymour Jr., said, ``The wife's entire life has been left inshambles by this case. She has been branded an adulteress. She hasbecome obligated to pay legal fees of many hundreds of thousands ofdollars. She is being forced out of her home and to give up herold-age security.''   The case is Getz vs. Getz, 90-562.</TEXT></DOC>
