<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-35-0411 </DOCNO><TEXT>A brief overview of nuclear radiation processes is presented. Units ofradiation energy and dose are discussed. Interactions of radiation processeswith matter are analyzed in order to understand radiation and its energy.Range is discussed in relation to structures of matter in representativematerials. Specific emphasis is placed on interaction of these radiationprocesses with soils in order to consider the ultimate effects of radiationon optical fibers located in a medium of soil and soil types. The shieldingeffects of soils are analyzed for the purpose of understanding radiationdamage to any buried cable that may contain optical fibers.</TEXT></DOC>
