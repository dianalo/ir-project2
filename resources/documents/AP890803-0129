The Commerce Department's Index of Leading Economic Indicatorsedged down 0.1 percent in June following a May decline of 1.3percent, which had been the steepest drop in 19 months.   The leading index still has not flashed the traditional signalof an impending recession, which is three consecutive monthlydeclines. Decreases in February, March, May and June were broken upby a 0.6 percent rise in April.   But many economists cautioned that the three-straight rule isnot infallible. The steep 1981-82 recession had actually begunbefore the index recorded its third consecutive decline.   Some analysts said they believed the economy is headed for adownturn, based on the weakness already shown in the leading indexand various other business barometers.   ``We are flirting with a mild recession,'' said Allen Sinai,chief economist of the Boston Co. He predicted that economic growthwould decline for two consecutive quarters beginning in the firstthree months of 1990.   Bruce Steinberg, an economist with Merrill Lynch, said hebelieved the 6{-year expansion has already ended and economicoutput will be contracting in both the current July-Septemberquarter and the final quarter of this year.   But David Wyss, an economist with DRI-McGraw Hill, said thecountry should be able to skate by a period of very sluggish growthwithout an actual downturn although he cautioned, ``It's time tocross your fingers.''   At the White House, the administration remained optimistic ofreaching its target for overall economic growth of 2.9 percent thisyear, as measured by the GNP, although officials said growth wouldbe lower than in 1987 and 1988.   ``The weakness in the leading indicators over recent months isconsistent with our view that economic growth is likely to remainrelatively soft over the second half of 1989,'' said presidentialspokesman Marlin Fitzwater.   The GNP, the country's total output of goods and services, grewat a lackluster annual rate of 1.7 percent in the just-completedApril-June quarter, the slowest growth rate in almost three years.   Economists who believe production will keep expanding in thelast half of the year base their optimism on the fact that theFederal Reserve Board switched from driving interest rates higheras a way of fighting inflation to easing credit, starting in June,in order to keep the economy expanding.   Lawrence A. Hunter, deputy chief economist of the U.S. Chamberof Commerce, said the debate over whether the economy wouldactually topple into a recession missed the point that the Fed'syear-long effort to slow economic growth had already produced``unacceptable casualties.''   He said that the slower growth, even without a recession, wouldtranslate into an extra 500,000 Americans without jobs and $50billion added to the budget deficit next year.   ``The economy is struggling and will continue to struggle as adirect consequence of the Federal Reserve Board's past tightmonetary policy,'' Hunter said.   In another report showing general weakness, the Labor Departmentsaid Thursday that productivity of American workers edged up aminuscule 0.2 percent in the April-June quarter after having fallenby 1.3 percent in the first three months of the year.   The sluggish growth in productivity, defined as output per hourof work, was accompanied by rising employment costs. Unit laborcosts rose at an annual rate of 5.2 percent in the second quarterafter an even faster 6.2 percent rate of increase in the secondquarter.   Economists said this jump in labor costs meant that inflationarypressures would not abate quickly, even though energy and foodcosts have moderated.   The 0.1 percent drop in the June leading index reflectedwidespread weakness, with seven of 11 components declining.   The biggest negative impact came from drop in raw materialprices. While this is an indication of lessening inflationpressures, it also can mean less demand, which is viewed as anegative by the forecasting gauge.   Other negative forces in June were a jump in unemploymentclaims; a fall in building permits; a speedup in business deliverytimes, also viewed as a sign of falling demand; a decline in thelength of the average work week; a drop in orders for consumergoods, and a smaller backlog of unfilled orders for manufacturedgoods.   Four indicators showed strength in June. The biggest plus factorwas a rise in stock prices followed by higher consumer confidence,faster growth of the money supply and an increase in plant andequipment orders.   The various changes left the leading index at 143.5 percent ofits 1982 base of 100.</TEXT></DOC>
