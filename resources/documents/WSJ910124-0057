The policy change, which could have sweeping long-termimplications, was outlined yesterday by the transportationsecretary in a speech to the National Press Club and spelledout in a separate department order. That order, in effect,rescinded a 1989 directive that KLM Royal Dutch Airlines sella big chunk of its ownership stake in NWA Inc.'s NorthwestAirlines.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Skinner said his new interpretation of federal lawgoverning foreign investment in the nation's carriers &quot;willallow U.S. airlines to attract additional foreign capital&quot;without compromising national security. Department officialssaid, however, they aren't aware of any foreign carrierspoised to buy big chunks of American airlines.   While praising the decision, airline analysts predicted itprobably won't have a significant short-term effect.&quot;Everybody is pulling in their horns a little bit&quot; because ofthe world-wide slump in travel, said Raymond Neidl, airlinesanalyst for Dillon Read andamp; Co. &quot;But longer term,&quot; he added,the policy &quot;could help the weaker carriers&quot; by funnelingmuch-needed cash from foreign carriers seeking a foothold inthe U.S.   Mr. Skinner's action came under immediate fire from laborunions, who are worried that their members will be hurt ifforeigners exert increased control over domestic carriers.   Specifically, Mr. Skinner changed his view of whatconstitutes foreign control of a U.S. airline. Under federallaw, foreigners are prohibited from holding more than 25% ofthe voting stock of a U.S. airline or exercising acontrolling interest in any U.S. carrier.   In August 1989, KLM provided a $400 million equityinvestment when an investor group led by Alfred Checchiacquired NWA. A few months later, Mr. Skinner orderedNorthwest to sharply reduce KLM's stake -- roughly 57% --even though it represented only about 5% of the voting stock.The transportation secretary argued that the big investmentcould allow KLM to effectively control Northwest.   Yesterday, in a turnaround, Mr. Skinner said thatforeigners could buy as much as 50% of the total equity in anairline without being considered a potential controllinginterest. He also said the department would take a morelenient view of foreign membership on domestic airlineboards, provided the foreign directors recuse themselves frommaking decisions affecting competition.   For the moment, Mr. Skinner said he has decided againstproposing that the foreign-ownership law be changed. He saidthat he didn't think a change was necessary in view of hisnew interpretation of the law. But his decision also signalsthat he doesn't want to battle with Congress, which isconcerned about the potential foreign takeover of animportant American industry.   Mr. Skinner's policy shift means that Northwest won't berequired to reduce KLM's investment -- a ruling sought byNorthwest to strengthen its cash position. But the departmentsaid any foreign equity over 49% must remain in a votingtrust.</TEXT></DOC>
