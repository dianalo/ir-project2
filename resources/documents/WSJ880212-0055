MCI and Toronto-based Northern Telecom wouldn't disclose terms of the multi-year contract. However, industry sources valued the agreement at $150 million.    Washington-based MCI has come under fire from industry analysts for neglecting its telephone network while implementing aggressive cost-cutting measures. In 1987, MCI spent $650 million on network modernization, down from $1.1 billion invested in the network in 1986.    The latest move signals that the telecommunications concern will start investing more in its network. The contract calls for Northern Telecom, a manufacturer of fully digital telecommunications systems, to upgrade MCI's network with advanced switching and signaling capabilities that were introduced last June.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, MCI closed at $10.875, up 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
