Minpeco S.A. won more than $130 million in a jury verdict last month against Nelson Bunker Hunt, William Herbert Hunt, Lamar Hunt and two other defendants. After a six-month trial, the jury found the defendants had conspired to corner the world silver markets of 1979-80. Minpeco's lawyers requested the bond to ensure that the Hunts retain sufficient assets to pay the award, plus interest and other expenses. The Hunt brothers' response was submitted under seal and its contents could not be determined.    &quot;We think there must be a bond in order to assure the status quo of the defendants' assets,&quot; said Shaun Corette, a partner at Cole, Corette andamp; Abrutyn, the Washington law firm representing Minpeco, who had not yet seen the sealed documents.    The Hunts' attorneys at Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays andamp; Handler have said they object to the bond because the Hunts have the assets to pay the judgment and because the ultimate damages -- if any -- may differ from the jury verdict. Within the next month or so, the Hunts' lawyers will submit post-trial motions, including a motion to overturn the verdict. Judge Morris E. Lasker is presiding over the case.    A court hearing on the bond question is scheduled for tomorrow in New York federal district court. </TEXT></DOC>
