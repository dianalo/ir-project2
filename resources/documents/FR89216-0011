Since the 1971 decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in <T3>Bivens </T3>v. <T3>Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </T3>403U.S. 388, lawsuits against Federal employees in their individual capacitieshave proliferated. Recent statistics from the Department of Justice indicatethat more than 14,000 claims have been filed against Federal employeespersonally since the <T3>Bivens </T3>case. Nearly 5,000 of these suits are pending. A numberof these suits have been filed against ED officials. The recent enactment of the Federal Employees Liability Reform and TortCompensation Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100-694, does not eliminate the needfor these regulations. That Act provides, in essence, that a Federal employeecan no longer be personally sued for common law torts arising from actswithin the scope of employment. This legislation, however, does not applyto claims arising under the Constitution. Accordingly, Federal employeesremain subject to constitutional tort actions in their personal capacities.The potential for adverse judgments against a Federal employee for actionstaken within the scope of employment is detrimental to both the individualemployee and the Federal Government. Although there are currently provisionsfor employees to request representation by the Department of Justice inthese actions, the individual employee still bears the risk of personalliability for an adverse judgment. Moreover, the prospect of personal liabilityand the uncertainty as to what conduct may result in a lawsuit againstthe employee personally may intimidate employees, impede creativity, andstifle initiative and decisive action. Employees' concerns regarding personalliability can affect Government operations, decision making, and policydeterminations. A provision for indemnification of ED employees would help alleviate theseproblems and would afford these employees the same protection given otherFederal officials. These regulations permit, but do not require, ED to indemnify a Departmentemployee who suffers an adverse judgment or other monetary award. Indemnificationis provided only if the actions leading to the award were taken withinthe scope of employment and if the indemnification is in the interest ofthe United States, as determined by the Secretary. The Department anticipatesthat, in making this determination, the Secretary will take into accountvarious factors such as the nature of the employee's actions, the relationshipof those actions to the employee's employment, the cooperation of the employeein the conduct of the proceeding, the nature of the adverse judgment, andthe potential effect on future departmental operations. Under the same standards, these regulations also allow ED to pay Departmentfunds to settle a claim against an employee in his or her individual capacity.The Department does not indemnify or settle before entry of an adversejudgment unless the Secretary determines that exceptional circumstancesjustify an exception. This limitation is designed to discourage the filingof lawsuits against Federal employees in their individual capacities inorder to pressure the Government into settlement.These regulations apply to actions pending against ED employees as of theeffective date of the regulations, as well as to actions commenced afterthat date.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980</ITAG>These regulations are not subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act becausethey deal solely with internal matters governing ED personnel.<ITAG tagnum="84">Inapplicability of Proposed Rulemaking</ITAG>The Secretary has determined, under 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(2), that these regulationsdo not require public notice and comment because they relate to the managementand personnel of the Department.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 34 CFR Part 60</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Government employees.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: February 13, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Lauro F.
