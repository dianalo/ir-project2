(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A self-taught computer wizard isattracting the attention of police from around the nation andScotland Yard for a computer dialing program that checks on elderlypeople who live alone.   ``Good morning!'' the recorded message announces. ``Are youO.K.?''   If the recipient of the call utters a response, the computerassumes the answer is yes and moves on to the next person. Ifthere's no answer or the telephone is busy, the computer repeatsthe call.   But if there's no answer a second or third time, the computerdesigned by Bruce Johnson sounds an alert to law enforcementofficials who dispatch a squad car to see if anyone is in danger.   ``It's a good deal all the way through,'' said Clyde Ritter, 73,of rural Osage, Iowa. ``They say it saved my life.''   Ritter had gone into a diabetic coma one morning in August athis home five miles northwest of Osage.   The town's ``Are You O.K.?'' computer at police headquartersalerted authorities that Ritter failed to answer a second call, anda deputy sheriff was sent to the home. He found Ritter comatose andsummoned an ambulance.   ``I guess I credit the system for saving at least one life,''said Osage Police Officer Michael DeKruif. ``We've had tremendoussuccess with it.''   Besides Ritter's rescue, the system has alerted Osage police toan elderly man whose hands were caught in a window _ trapping himinside his own home _ and to three elderly people who had fallen intheir homes and needed police to help them.   ``I haven't seen anything like it,'' said Retha Jefferson, apolice department desk officer in Belhaven, N.C. ``It's just thatofficers respond to calls all the time of neighbors not seeingtheir neighbors for two or three days and then it's too late.''   Jefferson, who manually calls about 45 elderly people each dayto check on them, said Belhaven is raising $7,000 to buy a system.   The 41-year-old Johnson said he developed the program about ayear ago for Osage ``more or less as a public service'' while hewas living in nearby Austin, Minn. Johnson had video stores inAustin and Osage and was considered a computer guru by friends.   Members of the police department had heard of a computer dialingsystem in Carthage, Mo., and they wanted Johnson to improve on it.   ``I foolishly told the city, `I'll write it for you,''' Johnsonsaid. ``It took me 14 months.''   Thanks to publicity in law enforcement journals, the project hasblossomed into a full-time business for Johnson, a former Army andNational Guard officer.   Only Osage, Charles City, Iowa, and Sutherlin, Ore., are on linewith the system, but inquiries and purchase orders have beenpouring in from all over.   ``We had a call from Scotland Yard on it,'' said Robert O'Keefe,the only other officer in Johnson's home-based company, NorthlandInnovations.   ``The whole thing has caught me off guard,'' Johnson said.``Maybe I'm achieving the American dream by accident, but that'sOK.''   Johnson, a two-time University of Minnesota dropout who haslived in Brazil, Germany and the Bronx, started to teach himselfabout computers in 1982 when he was bedridden for six months with aback injury.   He said ``Are You O.K.?'' programs are flexible and easy tooperate. The service is free to the residents where a system isbased.   Participation is voluntary, but police departments emphasize theimportance of avoiding false alarms. Participants are asked to bein their homes and off the telephone at the same time each day toanswer the call. They are required to report in advance when theywill not be home so the information can be stored in the computerin time to avert a call.   ``My goal for `Are You O.K.?' is to see one in every city in theU.S.,'' Johnson said.</TEXT></DOC>
