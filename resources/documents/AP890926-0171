Most of the testimony centered on the requirements under theproposed legislation that inter-city bus fleets be made accessibleto the disabled within six or seven years of enactment.   The bus operators interpret that requirement as a mandate thatall buses be equipped with wheelchair lifts, which they say costfrom $10,000 to $35,000 per bus to install, not to mentionmaintenance costs.   ``The mandatory lift requirement, with its attendant costs,including installation, seat loss, and possible package expressloss, would spell the end of intercity bus service in the UnitedStates,'' said Frank M. Henry, chairman of the American BusAssociation.   The operators are proposing alternatives, such as a system ofleasing equipped buses or having a limited number in the fleet,making those buses available on call.   Advocates for the disabled say they have the same right tospontaneous travel that others have, and a reservations system orother limited availability would prevent that.   With 200,000 buses in the total fleet operated by members of theAmerican Bus Association, the cost of installing lifts would wouldrange from $20 million to $70 million, said Henry, of Wilkes-Barre,Pa.   He told the surface transportation subcommittee of the Committeeon Public Works and Transportation that by contrast, the industryhad operating income of $41.5 million from 1982-1986.   The bus operators say the installation of wheelchair lifts wouldresult in the loss of up to four revenue-producing seats, not tomention cargo and luggage space and modifying restrooms.   Owners also testified that where wheelchair access was in place,demand was minimal.   Advocates for the disabled told the subcommittee, however, thatthe bill does not specify wheelchair lifts, but added that the lifttechnology is so advanced that the cost estimates given by theindustry are exaggerated.   Most of the testimony Tuesday and in a hearing by thesubcommittee last week dealt with the costs of lifts.   A German-designed lift used on Denver buses costs $11,000,removes only one seat and occupies no baggage space, said MarilynGolden of the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund.   She also said there is no requirement to modify restrooms,adding that the disabled have had long experience coping withoutbathrooms.   She and several other witnesses disputed the claims of lowridership, saying the disabled have been conditioned not be be ableto expect to travel.   ``It takes time for them to believe the word `Yes','' said JohnWinski, assistant director of the Massachusetts Coalition ofCitizens with Disabilities.</TEXT></DOC>
