As the official measure of the population, the census is too important to be subjected to partisan whim. You draw the wrong conclusion, however, in suggesting that efforts to correct the census for minority undercounts are merely more interference. In fact, the litigation being contemplated by the City of New York would seek to restore a plan devised by professionals at the Census Bureau to correct the 1990 census for people who will inevitably be missed by traditional enumeration methods -- a plan that was quashed by political appointees at the Department of Commerce, the agency that oversees the Census Bureau.    The decision by the Department of Commerce was not based on any doubts about the technical feasibility of the Census Bureau's plan. Rather, it was based on an assessment of the political consequences of improving the census count. Commerce knew what all those familiar with the Census Bureau have known for a long time: the census consistently and dramatically undercounts blacks and Hispanics, particularly urban blacks and Hispanics. Quite simply, the Department of Commerce feared that a more accurate census would mean more representatives in Congress, more representatives in the state legislatures, and more federal and state funds for minorities, groups that have not been sympathetic to this administration's agenda.    The plans to correct the 1990 census that Commerce rejected were the result of years of study and testing carried out by the professional statisticians of the Census Bureau. Panels of experts from the American Statistical Association, the Population Association of America and the National Academy of Sciences all endorsed the bureau's correction plans. These scientists labored, not for any partisan aim, but to produce the most accurate census possible. Yet when the Census Bureau's director, John Keane, informed the Department of Commerce that correction of the census was feasible, he was directed not to do it.    Commerce's political interference so disturbed Barbara Bailar -- at the time, associate Census Bureau director for statistical standards -- that she resigned after 29 years with the bureau. Ms. Bailar has said that Commerce's decision not to correct 1990 census for the minority undercount was &quot;dressed up in technical language, but was purely a political decision&quot; (&quot;Power, Money at Stake in Reagan Decision to Bar Census from Adjusting its Counting of Minorities,&quot; Wall Street Journal, April 12, 1988).    The litigation contemplated by the City of New York, as well as by several other municipalities and states, would seek only to return control over census planning and operations to the experts of the Census Bureau itself. Our goal, like yours, would be to remove partisan politics from the decisions about how best to conduct the census. The city simply wants a restoration of the bureau's authority to design the census -- a census that fully counts minorities and that is consistent with the agency's obligations.    Peter L.
