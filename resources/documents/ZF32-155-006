(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Film recorders, which process computer images and record them on film, aretraditionally of interest only to specialized slide service bureaus.andO;Professional film recorders cost upwards of $40,000, and a capitalexpenditure this large can usually be justified only if the recorders can berented out on a production basis.andP;  Less expensive recorders are available (inthe $10,000 to 25,000 range), and some large organizations have found itcost-effective to acquire them.andP;  But since these machines are still expensiveand require significant skill to operate, they are usually found in corporategraphics departments that function essentially as internal slide services,with a dedicated staff to meet the needs of the whole company.andP;  Theservice-bureau approach works well for some, but many people don't like torely on outsiders to create their slides.andP;  First, there's the problem of leadtime.andP;  Just because you need slides tomorrow does not mean that a servicewill be able to create them in time for you, and if you need a quick slideproof, you're out of luck.andM;Then there's the security issue.andP;  If your sensitive quarterly results orcomps must pass through the hands of strangers, there is always the chancethat something might leak somewhere; the best way to guard secrets is to keepthem to yourself.andM;Finally, there's the confidence factor.andP;  If your performance is going to bejudged on the results, you may feel more comfortable having the entireprocess right at hand, where you can see its progress and know that theresults will be ready when you need them.andM;All of these considerations make it desirable to have slide imagingcapabilities right at your desktop.andP;  And manufacturers have responded to thisneed by producing less expensive film recorders suitable for the purpose.andO;Though these desktop film recorders aren't for everyone, they are inexpensiveenough for those who really need them to have such units all to themselves.andM;REVIEW CRITERIAandM;In this review, we look at four film recorders suitable for the desktopmarket.andP;  All are technologically similar to the more expensive cousins usedby slide service bureaus; they use digital technology and support aresolution of at least 2,000 lines with up to 16.7 million simultaneouscolors on any image.andP;  All of them have list prices under  9,000, includingthe PC interface.andM;Agfa Matrix Division's Agfa ProColor, Lasergraphics' LFR, and PresentationTechnologies' Montage FRI were all reviewed in our previous look at filmrecorders (&quot;From Screen to SlideAffordably,&quot;PCMagazine,February28, 1989),though they have new options and new software in some cases.andP;  There's also anewcomer, Polaroid Corp.'s Polaroid Digital Palette CI-3000, a digitalcounterpart to the popular analog Polaroid Palette (which we mentioned inFirst Looks, January 29, 1991).andM;A few other models exist in this category.andP;  The Mirus FilmPrinter and theForefront Graphics F2FR both fit our criteria for review, but the vendor ofthe former could not supply us with an evaluation unit in time, and we wereunable to complete our tests on the latter because final versions of thenecessary drivers were not available at the time of shipping.andP;  ThePhotoMetric SlideMaker from General Parametrics Corp. has a price tag in thisrange, but it does not support 16.7 million simultaneous colors.andM;THE BENEFITS OF BEING DIGITALandM;The earliest low-cost film recorders, like the original Polaroid Palette,were analog recorders.andP;  These work by taking a video signal directly from thecomputer and displaying it on a small CRT contained in a case; a camera thentakes a picture of this full-color image.andP;  The approach is fast and cheap,and it creates good enough images for proofing and for relatively undemandingapplications.andP;  But since the image is created by the video adapter in yourPC, its resolution and number of colors are limited to those the signal cansupply: If you use a VGA adapter, then 640 by 480 pixels by 16 colors is allyou'll get.andP;  High-quality analog recorders exist, notably Focus Graphics'ImageCorder, which is designed primarily for rapid imaging of CAD drawings.andO;But business-quality slides require digital technology.andM;Digital film recorders also have a CRT and a camera, but they work verydifferently from their analog cousins (see the sidebar &quot;From Screen toScreen: How a Film Recorder Works&quot;).andP;  Instead of putting up a full-colorimage and snapping its picture, a digital recorder exposes the red, green,and blue components of the image separately through colored filters.andP;  Thisprocess is slower, but since the resolution depends on the recorder's ownrasterizer rather than your video card, the results are of much higherquality than you can get from an analog system.andM;Once the image is on film, it is treated much like any other photograph.andP;  Ifthe camera body (called the camera back) is a standard 35-mm.andP;  model, yousimply send the film away to be developed into color prints or slides.andP;  Ifit's an instant-camera back, you can develop and mount the slides yourselfusing standard film cutting and mounting equipment.andM;SPECS AND SPECSandM;In practice, the only way to determine whether you are likely to get qualityslides is to run a few and see them for yourself But it's important to knowabout some basic technical issues so that you can understand what affectsquality.andM;The traditional resolution for 35-mm.andP;  slides has 4,000 lines, or 4,096 by2,732 pixels; this is known as 4K resolution.andP;  All recorders we reviewedexcept the Polaroid Digital Palette CI-3000 support 4K resolution.andP;  Itrepresents the finest resolution that the light-sensitive particles onstandard 35-mm.andP;  film can achieve.andM;Sometimes you will want the highest possible resolution (for formalpresentations in large auditoriums, for instance, where any blemishes will beblown up to wall size).andP;  Yet 2,000 lines (2,048 by 1,366 pixels) is plentyfor many situations.andP;  Though jaggies and artifacts are more noticeable atthis lower resolution if you look closely, they are subtle enough to beignored if your audience isn't sitting too close to the screen.andP;  And2,000-line slides are a good deal faster to create than 4,000line slides.andO;All the recorders in this group have 2,000-line modes, and in the Polaroidrecorder this is the highest resolution available.andM;2,000- or 4,000-line resolution isn't necessarily a measure of the sharpnessof the slides, though.andP;  This addressable resolution is only the number ofpixels that the recorder can define in its controller; the actual number ofdots that can be exposed on the film (the resolvable resolution) may besmaller, depending on the spot size and other characteristics of the internalCRT.andP;  If the resolvable resolution is too much lower than the addressableresolution, the image tends to look fuzzy, as the large spots overlap andobscure each other.andP;  Yet the spots must overlap somewhat to produce acontinuous image.andM;A film recorder's color-handling ability is also important.andP;  All theserecorders support full 24-bit color, which assigns 8 bits per pixel for eachof the red, green, and blue (RGB) components, for a total of 16.7 millioncolors.andP;  This is more than enough colors for any image; in fact, it's morethan the human eye can see.andP;  But problems can still arise due to differencesbetween the ways film and the eye perceive color.andP;  These are most apparent ingradients- tints that gradually shift from color to color-which look soattractive in slide backgrounds.andP;  Depending on the quality of the colorlookup tables that map RGB values to film colors, you may see noticeablebanding and abrupt transitions.andM;One way of smoothing out gradients is to increase the number of resolvablecolors by representing each one with 33 bits instead of 24 bits (I I bitseach for red, blue, and green).andP;  Though this does not increase the actualnumber of addressable colors, it does offer more steps within each color forgradients.andP;  Some relatively high-end recorders, such as Lasergraphics' LFRPlus, use this feature.andP;  In our group, the Polaroid Digital Palette CI-3000employs 3000 this technology.andM;In addition tb applying gradient backgrounds, film recorders also offerseveral hardware fonts for rendering text.andP;  The advent of high-qualityscalable fonts in business graphics packages makes these less important, butolder packages such as Harvard Graphics still rely on the fonts built intothe recorder.andP;  Since most presentations rely heavily on word charts, having avariety of good-quality hardware fonts is crucial.andM;BILL OF OPERATIONSandM;The above considerations are important in selecting a recorder, but whatmatters in using one is the accessories: the software that the manufacturersupplies to adjust and control the recorder, and the various camera backs.andM;The traditional way to get your images into a film recorder is to write theoutput to a file and then copy it to the recorder.andP;  But this is a crudemethod, so most recorders today come with software that lets you group imagesin groups of 36-the number of frames in a standard film roll-and send them tothe recorder in a batch.andP;  Some software, such as Polaroid's ImagePrint, letsyou print images in standard graphics file formats.andP;  Vector formats such asCGM or HPGL are the best for this purpose, as they can print at the highresolutions that film recorders support without degradation.andP;  But often youcan print high-resolution bitmapped images as well.andP;  The most popularbitmapped formats are TIFF and Targa's.TGA format; unlike, say,.PCX, thesesupport full 24-bit color.andM;These batch-printing schemes work well enough, but it is usually easiest toprint your images directly from your graphics program.andP;  Many film recordersnow have direct drivers for such popular graphics applications as HarvardGraphics and Lotus Freelance Plus.andP;  And with the recent popularity ofMicrosoft Windows 3.0, most vendors are actively working on Windows drivers,which opens up their recorders to a whole world of Windows-based graphicssoftware.andP;  Presentation Technologies and Polaroid even offer custom versionsof Zenographics' SuperPrint, which not only let you print from any Windowsapplication but also vastly extend the recorder's text capabilities byletting you use any industry-standard scalable font outlines.andP;  Unfortunately,none of the recorders had Windows drivers available in final form when wetested.andM;While PostScript has become the overwhelming favorite imaging model for colorpublications, it has not yet taken over the film recorder world.andP;  All but thePolaroid recorder were offering PostScript options at the time of our review,but these come in the form of add-ons: Lasergraphics and PresentationTechnologies offer versions of the PostScript-compatible software interpreterFreedom of Press, while Agfa offers an expensive hardware solution in theChromascript.andP;  This retrograde situation may be changing, if new products areany guide: The Forefront F2FR, for example, is designed specifically forimaging PostScript slides.andM;THE MECHANICAL EYEandM;Photography can be a complex subject, but the camera and film needed fordesktop film recorders are fairly simple.andP;  The standard camera back on mostfilm recorders is an ordinary 35-mm.andP;  camera from Canon or Pentax-just likethe one you would buy in a camera store.andP;  It operates just like an ordinarycamera, too, so it should not be hard to master if you have any experiencewith photography.andP;  The Lasergraphics and Polaroid offer optional backs tocreate 4- by 5-inch transparencies, and the latter even has an 8- by 10inchtransparency back, though most people will want to go to a service bureau forthe use of this expensive specialty item.andM;Most camera backs are self-loading and offer automatic advance, but if youregularly shoot more than a roll or so at a time, you'll appreciate anautomatic camera back like the one available with Lasergraphics'LFR.andP;  Thisclever machine winds to the end on loading so that it can count frames, andit has a liquid crystal display that gives you status messages in Englishrather than gobbledygook.andP;  Such state-of-the-art features can really simplifythe operation of the recorder.andM;Though film recorder manufacturers recommend professional-quality film forbest results, many people use ordinary Ektachrome 100; it's readilyavailable, and you can develop it anywhere.andP;  Polaroid also offers a varietyof instant-processing films; instead of waiting a day or two to get your filmback from a processing lab, you can see your results in a minute or two.andO;These instant films do not always produce the same quality as professionallyprocessed film, but they do provide a method for last-minute changes.andO;Larger-format instant-transparency films are available as well as the 35-mm.andO;format; Polaroid even makes a tiny, portable projection stand that you canuse to display these mini-transparencies on a standard overhead projector.andM;MAKING A CHOICEandM;Should you buy a desktop film recorder, and if so, how should you go aboutselecting one?andM;Saving money may be the first concern that springs to mind when you think ofgetting a film recorder.andP;  The idea of avoiding those $15-per-slide fees maybe awfully tempting, but before you start making rosy projections, considerthat the real cost of using a film recorder goes well beyond purchasing therecorder itself For one thing, slides take so long to image that most sitesdoing any kind of volume must dedicate a PC to the task; this is doublynecessary if you're using a software PostScript interpreter or a customversion of SuperPrint as a Windows driver, both of which rely on your PC todo the bruteforce work of rasterizing the images.andP;  It's also important toconsider the costs of film processing.andM;Most important, though, is the intangible cost of your time.andP;  Bringing a filmrecorder in-house means that you will be doing a lot of the work that theslide service bureau formerly took care of, including troubleshooting.andP;  Seenin this light, overall usability may be the single most important criterionby which to judge the suitability of a film recorder intended for desktopuse.andM;Service bureaus can afford to tinker with adjustments, fine-tune colortables, and commission custom drivers, and the high prices of professionalrecorders make it worth the vendors' while to provide onsite service.andP;  But asan end user with a desktop recorder, you're on your own.andP;  So you should payattention to such niceties as automatic camera backs and the quality ofinstallation manuals when you read the accompanying reviews.andM;Though the low volumes that most desktop users produce make speed relativelyunimportant, the quality of the slides is critical.andP;  While these recorders donot quite equal the quality available from the expensive professionalrecorders that slide service bureaus use, they're easily good enough for mostuses.andP;  Unless you are going to present your images in a huge auditorium youraudience is exceptionally picky-you'll do just fine with these.andM;The four machines described in the following pages offer various combinationsof features and performance at a price that can be justified in a short time.andO;If you currently rely on outside services to produce a significant number ofslides each year, and you're willing to take on the burden of learning andoperating the equipment, you will find one of these to be an affordablealternative.andM;FROM SCREEN TO SCREEN:  HOW A FILM RECORDER WORKSandM;Digital film recorders create images through triple exposure.andP;  After theimage is rasterized, its red, green, and blue components are displayed lineby line on a monochrome CRT, passing through a filter of the appropriatecolor before striking the film.andP;  The result is a full-color image that canthen be developed and printed by conventional photographic processes.andM;1.andP;  ImageandM;Everything starts with the graphics image.andP;  Vector images are preferred,because they are not shackled to the resolution at which they were created,but high-resolution bitmapped images can also achieve attractive effects.andP;  Inany case, each graphics file must be converted to the recorder's nativecontrol language (such as the SCODL language that Agfa Matrix film recordersuse); this task is performed by the driver in your application package or bysoftware that comes with the film recorder.andM;2.andP;  RasterizerandM;Though control languages are vector-based, the film recorder understands onlybitmapped data, so all images must be rasterized (converted into patterns ofpixels) and broken up into red, green, and blue components before being sentto the recorder.andP;  The rasterizer also substitutes high-quality hardware fontsand applies gradient backgrounds to your images.andP;  All this adds up to aprocessor-intensive job, whose length increases with the complexity of theimage.andM;Some recorders have hardware rasterizers, supplied on add-in boards.andP;  Thesetake the load off the computer's own processor, but with a microprocessor anda few megabytes of memory, they are expensive.andP;  The alternative is torasterize in software, using your computer's processor to do the work.andO;SuperPrint, which some recorders use to print from Windows applications, andthe PostScript-compatible software interpreters that many recorders offer forprocessing PostScript images fall into this category.andM;3.andP;  InterfaceandM;With 4,096 by 2,732 pixels, each of which may be 24 bits deep, the averageslide represents a lot of data to push over a parallel connection.andP;  Each ofthe film recorders in our review offers a high-speed interface, eitherstandard or as an option, and these interfaces give you a speed boost thatcan be critical in high-volume service operations.andP;  But the time required tosend files is not large compared with the total imaging time, and thisconsideration may not matter much on the desktop.andM;4.andP;  Picture tubeandM;The heart of a film recorder is the picture tube, and its quality is one ofthe chief determinants of the resolvable resolution (as opposed to theaddressable resolution) of the recorder.andP;  Image fuzziness, which results fromimperfectly placed or oversized spots that overlap and blur the edges ofobjects, can usually be traced to the picture tube.andM;Digital film recorders use monochrome tubes primarily for their quality; theyare simpler and more precise than color tubes, and they do not have thedistorting effects of a shadow mask.andP;  In general, larger picture tubes,smaller spot sizes, and longer necks should lead to more precise pictures,but the interactions are not that simple: Finding the optimal combination ofscreen area, spot size, and neck length within the budget is part of the artof recorder design.andM;5.andP;  Electronics and optics Picture tube specifications make a difference, butthey don't absolutely determine quality.andP;  The analog electronics that controlthe placement of the beam must compensate for inevitable nonlinearities inthe response characteristics of CRTs, as well as for the optical distortionsintroduced by the red, green, and blue filters, by the camera lens, and byany mirrors that the recorder uses.andP;  Circuit design is especially importantin desktop film recorders, which must get the most from relatively low-costcomponents.andM;6.andP;  Camera backandM;In contrast with the specialized components in the rest of the recorder, thecamera back is a standard item.andP;  Most recorders use ordinary 35-mm.andP;  camerabodies, though they often offer optional camera backs for creatingtransparencies or instant prints.andP;  Standard manual camera backs are fine forlow-volume work, but if you shoot more than a few rolls here and there, youshould make sure your recorder comes equipped with an automatic camera back.andM;7.andP;  FilmandM;One of the trickiest aspects of using a film recorder is choosing the properfilm, Different types of film have different responses to light, with somebeing more sensitive to blues and some to reds, and one of the most criticalparts of film recorder engineering is the development of the color lookuptables that map software RGB values to red, green, and blue beam intensities.andO;Each table must be carefully calibrated to the optical qualities of the typeof film you are using; imperfections in this software can result in banding,vignetting, or color distortions.andM;Many people use general-purpose film such as Ektachrome 100 for creatingslides, but most film recorder vendors recommend one or more types ofprofessional-quality film.andP;  These are more tightly controlled in themanufacturing process and consequently respond more uniformly to exposure anddevelopment.andP;  in either case, you should try to shoot all the slides in apresentation from the same emulsion batch to minimize color variations.andM;8.andP;  DeveloperandM;Unlike a color printer, a film recorder's output is not ready to go once thelight stops blinking; you need to have the film roll developed first.andO;Development has its own impact; the best film and the best recorder cannotcompensate for variations in chemicals and photographic processes.andP;  In ourtests, we went to the source, Kodak, to develop our slides.andP;  In practice, youwill find it worthwhile to work with your developer to get slides of thegreatest consistency.andM;You can avoid the outside development step by using Polaroid Polachrome35-mm.andP;  instant slide film, which fits inside an ordinary 35-mm.andP;  canisterand can be developed within a few minutes by using a special unit.andP;  You canproduce instant transparencies as well, with the proper camera back.andP;  Thequality of these instant images is noticeably lower than you would get fromconventional film, however.andM;9.andP;  ProjectorandM;No matter how much care you take to produce the finest slides, it can all goto naught unless you take equal care in the projection room.andP;  A slide willlook much clearer on a high-quality projector with a precision-ground glasslens than on a cheaper one with a plastic lens.andP;  The heat from the projectorcan cause the acetate to expand and the image to slip out of focus; glassmounting can help prevent this.andP;  The reflectivity of the screen influencesperceived brightness and color, as does the ambient lighting.andM;Polaroid Digital Palette CI-3000andM;No film recorder will ever be as trouble-free as the average laser printer,but Polaroid Corp. has come remarkably close with its Digital PaletteCI-3000, our Editors' Choice.andP;  Value-priced at only  4,495-$2,500 cheaperthan its closest competitor-it redefines value and ease of use in itscategory.andM;The other products we reviewed are essentially scaled-down versions ofprofessional film recorders, with cranky personalities to match.andP;  Bycontrast, the Polaroid Digital Palette CI-3000 is designed from the ground upas an end-user product.andP;  Everything you need comes as standard equipment,including not only a standard 35-mm.andP;  camera back but instant print andtransparency backs, an instant film-processing unit, and a slide mounter.andO;The parallel interface means that you don't need to fiddle with boards orjumpers, nor wade through a separate installation manual just to get the unitup and running.andM;Though it is limited to 2,000-line resolution, the CI-3000 doesn't take aback seat in terms of quality.andP;  In fact, its 2,000-line slides look almost asgood as the 4,000-line slides produced by competitors, and they are farquicker and easier to produce.andM;Intelligent design decisions, including enhanced 33-bit color handling(normally found only on much costlier professional units), do an excellentjob of putting quality where it counts, and cutting comers where it doesn't.andO;The Polaroid is slower than its competitors, but in low-volume desktop usethe difference will not be significant.andP;  For those who really need fasteroutput, Polaroid offers an optional processor board that speeds things up abit and lets imaging take place in the background.andM;The availability of drivers is always a worry when it comes to brand-newhardware, and it's true that the CI-3000 needs some improvement in thisrespect.andP;  Polaroid recommends that you use Business andamp; Professional Software'sPresentation Express, which it sells, but this is hardly the answer foreveryone.andP;  At the time of our testing, the CI-3000 supports other packagesonly through CGM files and its own ImagePrint software, which we found to bea chancy proposition.andP;  But a direct driver for Harvard Graphics and a customversion of SuperPrint for Microsoft Windows applications should be availableby the time you read this.andP;  These will open the recorder's horizons to a muchwider range of uses.andM;EVALUATING SLIDE QUALITYandM;To be consistent with the theme of this special issue, we evaluated filmrecorders and slide services primarily as output options for yourPC-generated business presentations.andP;  While all the recorders and servicesreviewed here can image raster files, we chose not to emphasize thosecapabilities in our testing; instead, we chose the most popular and widelysupported business graphics program, Harvard Graphics, to produce our testslides.andP;  The initial test suite also included PowerPoint files and PostScriptfiles created with CorelDRAW and Micrografx Designer, but none of therecorders had a shipping Windows driver at the time of our testing, and onlyone had a PostScript-compatible interpreter, so we were unable to runcomparative tests on these files.andM;In testing these four recorders, we concocted a set of images to process thatwere designed to show a recorder's strengths and weaknesses.andP;  With input fromvarious sources-most notably Management Graphics (makers of the Solitaireline of high-end professional film recorders)-we developed a set of images totest specific pitfalls that all recorders must face at one time or another.andO;We had slides with gray gradient backgrounds, which require strict control ofthe red, green, and blue values to image properly; these helped us to detectcolor balance problems.andP;  We had slides with samples of the default serif andsans serif fonts, to help evaluate the quality of the text alignment,leading, and kerning.andP;  And we had slides that included tricky side-by-sidecolor combinations, such as red next to green, to make any blooming andfringing problems stand out.andP;  In addition, we included a number of typicalbusiness slides, such as word charts, pie charts, and illustrative graphics.andM;TESTED BY DEFAULTandM;We tested each recorder in its default configuration; though service bureausoften fiddle with RGB intensities and other adjustments to get better resultson different types of images, we needed to get repeatable results, and wereasoned that most business users will not have time for too much adjustment.andO;Before shooting the final test slides, we shot instant slides (usingPolachrome film) to ensure that we had consistent and repeatable results.andM;Although we don't recommend using it, we chose Kodak Ektachrome 100 filmbecause it is the slide film most commonly used in these recorders.andP;  Tominimize the possible variations introduced in the developing process, wepurchased all film from the same emulsion batch, and had all film processeddirectly by Kodak, which kindly donated its services to us for the purpose.andO;In the case of any egregious problems, the slides were reshot and sent backto Kodak.andP;  All slides were Wess glass-mounted to prevent film degradation.andM;PASSING JUDGMENTandM;To evaluate the quality of the slides from the film recorders and slideservice bureaus, we presented the slides to a panel of judges.andP;  We knew thatascertaining what was &quot;good enough&quot; would require both trained and untrainedeyes to balance each other's perceptions.andP;  Moreover, visual perceptioncharacteristics differ between the sexes as well as among individuals.andO;Therefore, our panel of judges comprised three men and three women, includingboth art professionals and untrained viewers.andM;Before beginning the viewing, we presented the judges with the following listof artifacts, which they indicated as present, absent, or only slightlyvisible on each slide:andM;* Banding (visible transitions between shades).andM;* Vignetting (an abrupt transition between top and bottom colors, compressedin the middle of the image).andM;* Fringing  in which two colors overlap and mix at their borders).andM;* Jaggies or fuzziness on text or graphics.andM;* Poor color balance (a red, green, or blue cast on gray gradientbackgrounds).andM;* Inconsistent color density.andM;* Poor color saturation.andM;* Noticeable distortion.andM;During the judging, the panelists discussed the problems inherent withjudging color, and why comments such as &quot;That red is wrong&quot; wereinappropriate.andP;  We provided space for comments about any unlisted problemsthe judges spotted and for positive feedback they wished to voice.andP;  Finally,we asked them to give the recorder or service an overall score.andM;We chose to emulate the conditions of the type of small-to-medium sizedconference room that you typically find.andP;  including using standard projectionequipment.andP;  The slides were projected using a Kodak Ektagraphic III Bprojector equipped with an Ektagraphic Projection FF 76mm f/3.5 lens onto aDa-Lite Model L screen approximately 10 feet away.andP;  We seated our panel ofjudges approximately 15 feet from the screen, and refocused the projector asnecessary.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
