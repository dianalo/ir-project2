John S. R. Shad, who headed the SEC from 1981 to 1987 and now isenvoy to the Netherlands, confirmed Thursday through a spokesman atthe U.S. embassy there that he had been approached by Drexel aboutbecoming chairman, but he did not say whether he would accept.   The nation's fifth-largest securities firm also asked anotherex-SEC chairman, Roderick M. Hills, husband of U.S. traderepresentative-designate Carla Hills, about the possibility ofserving on its board of directors.   Hills, who ran the SEC from 1975-77 and is now an independenttrade consultant in Washington, also confirmed Drexel had approachedhim but declined to comment further.   It was under Shad's auspices that the SEC began a majorinvestigation of Drexel in late 1986, which resulted in a massivecivil enforcement action in September and a record securities-fraudplea deal between the firm and the Justice Department, reached lastmonth but still not finalized.   Shad ordered the Drexel probe after the firm was implicated inextensive wrongdoing by Ivan F. Boesky, the speculator and insidetrader now serving a three-year prison term.   ``The firm's objective is to develop a fresh outlook on theproblems and opportunities it faces, and to continue to make animportant contribution to the nation's capital markets,'' Drexelsaid in a brief statement Thursday disclosing the job offers to Shadand Hills.   ``The firm continues to enjoy the loyalty and support of the vastmajority of its employees, and investment banking, institutional andretail clients. After the settlement, the firm's $2 billion ofcapital will remain among the largest in the securities industry andwill be more than adequate to finance its future growth,'' thestatement said.   The invitations extended by Drexel were disclosed as the firmcontinued to negotiate with the government over final details of itssecurities fraud plea bargain settlement.   Under that accord, Drexel must pay a record $650 million in finesand restitution, plead guilty to six unspecified felonies, settlerelated civil litigation with the SEC and agree to cooperate in thegovernment's expanding campaign against Wall Street corruption.   Shad is credited with toughening the agency's enforcement effortsto reduce insider trading and other abuses on Wall Street, and is aleading proponent of strengthening business ethics in general.   Independently wealthy, with an extensive background on WallStreet, Shad resigned the SEC post in 1987 after a six-year tenureto accept the ambassador position.   If Shad were to accept a Drexel job, he would replace RobertLinton, who has long been expected to retire.   It would mark an ironic twist not only in the legal ordeal of theinvestment firm but also for Drexel's chief executive officer,Frederick Joseph, who was once hired by Shad 20 years ago when Shadran the now-defunct investment firm E.F. Hutton andamp; Co.   Word that Shad and Hills had been approached came a day afterDrexel said it and former Sen. Howard Baker had agreed to end talksabout a possible role for him in the firm's senior management.   Baker, a prominent Republican lawyer, former Tennessee senatorand one-time White House chief of staff under President Reagan, hadbeen negotiating with Drexel since November about assuming a seniorposition.   There was no explanation for why talks ended. But people familiarwith the talks said there was disagreement over how much managementcontrol would be exercised by Baker, who has no background in WallStreet investment banking.</TEXT></DOC>
