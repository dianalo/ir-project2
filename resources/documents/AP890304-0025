The investigators, in a report released by the Energy Departmenton Friday, blamed the Jan. 22 accident on ``significant andlongstanding weaknesses'' in operations at the Savannah River Plant,which includes three nuclear reactors.   The reactors are owned by the Energy Department and run by aprivate contractor.   The report said the troubles at Savannah River's K reactor, wherethe accident occurred, are symptomatic of problems throughout thecomplex that must be corrected before the reactors resume productionof tritium, a gas needed in the manufacture of American nuclear arms.   All three reactors have been shut down since last spring,crippling the nuclear weapons production program. A restart of the Kreactor has been planned for late this year, with the two otherreactors to resume operation in 1990.   There had been concern that the Jan. 22 accident might delay therestart schedule. The Energy Department has said that unless tritiumproduction were resumed by the end of the year, the nation's nucleararsenal could be put in jeopardy.   ``We do not see any significant schedule delay as a result ofthis,'' Leonard C. Sjostrom, an Energy Department health and safetyofficial said in a telephone interview from Savannah River. He wasone of the official investigators.   Sjostrom said the department still expected to announce aspecific restart schedule for the K reactor sometime this month. Hesaid he could not be more specific.   The Energy Department report said operators of the reactor andits support systems were unprofessional and lacking in discipline.It blamed their managers for this.   The conclusions of the 131-page report go to the heart of safety,technical and managerial problems at Savannah River that havevirtually shut down the complex.   Several valves in K reactor's backup cooling system were damagedin the accident, but because there was no fuel in the reactor, thehealth and safety of plant workers and the general public were notin danger, the report said.   The problem began when a pipe valve was inadvertently left openbefore the start of the cooling system test. This prevented theusual buildup of pressure in the pipes during the test. Instead ofhalting operations to determine the cause of the problem, du Ponttechnicians pumped more water into the pipes. This caused the openvalve to slam shut with extraordinary force, creating what is calleda ``water hammer'' that damaged several other valves.   A final assessment of the extent of damage has not yet beencompleted, officials said.   The investigators' report was strongly critical of the E. I. duPont de Nemours andamp; Co. management team that runs the reactor complexunder an Energy Department contract. It also criticized plantoperators and Energy Department officials on the site.   ``The investigative team reached a consensus that this event wasa direct result of significant and longstanding weaknesses thatcontinue to exist in the conduct of plant operations,'' the reportsaid.   The investigators cited du Pont's initial report of the incident,which happened on a Sunday. The company's report was a routineaccounting of what had taken place at the plant over the weekend. Itsaid there had been ``no incidents,'' while later mentioning thereactor accident only briefly.   The du Pont report included 10 ``events.'' Listed ahead of thereactor accident were such things as the spilling of one quart ofdiesel fuel and an operator falling off his chair.</TEXT></DOC>
