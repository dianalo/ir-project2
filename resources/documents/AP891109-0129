By a vote of 236-172, lawmakers approved legislation thatprovides much of Bush's request for land-based nuclear missiles andrestores some funds for two conventional-arms programs thepresident sought to kill.   The bill provides $3.8 billion for SDI, also known as Star Wars,in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1 _ about $279 million less thanthe amount spent in fiscal 1989.   The spending level represents the first reduction in the SDIprogram in its six-year history.   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed ServicesCommittee, said this budget represents the ``last deficit-drivendefense budget. What we're likely to face next year is the first ina series of (Soviet President Mikhail) Gorbachev-driven defensebudgets.''   But Rep. Ronald Dellums, D-Calif., said reductions in the U.S.defense budget in response to efforts toward democracy in EasternEurope should occur this year.   ``The Warsaw Pact is crumbling before our eyes and we'rebuilding weapons of destruction,'' said Dellums, a member of theHouse Armed Services panel.   The legislation, which still must be approved by the Senate,includes approximately $1.1 billion for the rail-based MXmultiple-warhead missile and the truck-based Midgetmansingle-warhead missile, about $150 million less than Bush hadrequested for the two nuclear weapons.   The bill also includes House language imposing a 50-missile capon the MX.   The bill provides $4.3 billion for the B-2 stealth bomberprogram _ $430 million less than the adminstration requested. Itprovides money for the purchase of two stealth bombers in fiscal1990 and components for five of the bat-winged aircraft in fiscal1991.   The legislation restores some money for the twoconventional-arms programs Bush sought to cancel _ the Marine CorpsOsprey tilt-rotor aircraft and the Navy's F-14D Tomcat.   The Osprey, an aircraft that takes off like a helicopter but canfly like a plane, will receive about $255 million in research anddevelopment money but no funds for procurement. The future of theprogram would be tied to commercial use of the plane.   The legislation also includes a provision calling for thepurchase of 18 F-14D fighters in fiscal 1990. However, the billrequires the manufacturer of the F-14D, Grumman Corp., of New York,to sign a contract to end future production of the plane.</TEXT></DOC>
