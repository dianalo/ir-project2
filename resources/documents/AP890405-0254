But the cube-making didn't melt down for a minute. Those sameemployees were back at the freezers of the Nashville-based companythe next day, although another company was signing their paychecks.   Noel joined the growing number of businesses leasing some or alltheir employees, a strategy that can cut costs and eliminatemanagement headaches ranging from payroll deductions toemployer-sponsored health insurance.   ``Every time I get a little piece of paper from the governmentabout my employees, I can just write 'em back and tell 'em Noel IceCo. has no employees,'' Voss says.   Employee leasing is now used to staff entire departments, fromdaycare centers to mail rooms to production lines. It has gainedthe most popularity among small and medium-sized businesses. Buteven large corporations are finding it attractive.   At Chase Manhattan Bank, leased messengers deliver up to 1,000documents a day. Insurance giant Cigna Corp. leases its daycarefacility.   The National Planning Association, an economic consulting groupin Washington, reckons the number of employees under lease is atleast 165,000, but some other estimates range as high as 500,000.   Joseph Honick, executive director of the National Staff LeasingAssociation, says the number of leasees is swelling by about 30percent a year, and by the end of the next decade, he projectsleased-employee population could exceed 3 million.   Leasing frees companies from the monumental worries associatedwith employees calling in sick, juggling vacation schedules,providing costly benefits and making social security payments tothe government.   ``It tightens the line between businesses and their customers,''Honick said. ``If you're in the business to sell shoes, you're notin business to run a payroll operation.''   In turn, a generation of entrepreneurs who organize the legionsof leasees has been spawned _ an estimated 400 companies existsolely to lease workers to other companies.   The trend started because ``companies have gotten very hurt inthe process of downsizing and upsizing and downsizing andupsizing,'' said Edith Weiner of the New York management consultingfirm of Weiner, Edrich, Brown Inc.   ``Companies want to keep their constant overhead lower, and theydon't really want to have the problem of laying people off,'' shesaid. ``Sometimes it costs more (to lease), but it gives you morelatitude.''   Until the Tax Reform Act of 1986, employee leasing wasconsidered a questionable practice, partly because high-incomeprofessionals such as doctors and lawyers used it so they could setup tax-deferred pension plans for themselves while avoiding themfor their workers. Once those loopholes were closed, leasing'scredibility rose.   Many employers praise the system. ``It saves me time,'' said VanStewart, president of Auto Rental Systems Inc., a car leasingcompany with operations in Nashville, Memphis, Dallas and St.Louis, that leases its 37 employees.   ``I don't have to spend any time on payroll, I don't have tofile (social security) ... I'm writing two checks a month insteadof 50 or 60,'' said Stewart. He even gets his own check from theleasing company.   Besides handling payroll, leasing companies can pool groups ofemployees for cheaper insurance. Noel's Voss said before he boughtthe company, it had been spending $112 a month per employee tocover health benefits. Now he's paying a leasing concern $87 amonth per employee for benefits he says are superior.   While a full benefits package can run as much as 60 percent ofan employee's base salary, ``we can bring it in for about 30 to 35percent,'' said Edward Katz, founder of New York-based ChoiceCourier Inc.   Katz's messenger service has evolved into a leasing operationwith 1,500 employees in nine East Coast cities. He's projecting 30percent growth this year, to about $40 million in annual revenues.   Like many other leasing concerns, Katz uses plenty of part-timehelp and scales back benefits like vacation time to save moremoney. He'll hire, fire, train and maintain a workforce for otherbusinesses.   ``The savings for a company is non-calculable,'' said Katz.``The people we're dealing with are on the bottom two rungs'' ofthe employment ladder. ``We've got the new wave of immigrants, andwe have to train them.''   With expertise in the mailroom, Katz says he can find savingswhere companies forget to look. For example, his workers transmitdocuments by facsimile machine to the West Coast after 6 p.m., whenphone costs are cheaper. They use lightweight envelopes to slashpostage.   To ensure each job is always fully staffed, Katz has a dozen orso workers waiting to be dispatched from a ``bullpen'' when otheremployees call in sick.   It's hard to find a critic of leasing. Although leased employeesdon't necessarily have high-paying jobs with generous benefits,they often have better security. If they're on one job and thecontract is canceled, their leasing company can shift them toanother worksite.   When a leasing company moves in to run an already-functioningoperation, those same employees stay on the job, although Honickrejects the characterization that they're fired first then rehired.   ``They don't write resignation letters,'' he said. ``A leasedemployee is a regular employee.''   Some say larger corporations have been slow to embrace theconcept because they often are bound by strict union agreements.But Honick says a deeper reason is there aren't enoughprofessional, qualified employee-leasing companies to go around.   In the past, leased employees have been relegated to running thecompany cafeteria or providing janitorial services. But the realmof services leased workers provide continues to broaden.   Cigna Corp. has contracted with the national child-care chainKinder-Care Inc. to provide a fully staffed daycare center housing80 children at its headquarters in Bloomfield, Conn. The cost tothe company has been minimal, since employees pay for most of theexpense.   ``If we were operating it ourselves, I don't know what it wouldcost, but I imagine it would be more expensive,'' said Cigna'sdirector of employee services, Beth Fox. ``We have some operatingcosts involved in grounds and indoor maintenance, but that's aboutit. ... We don't need to get involved in any great way.''   Because Cigna provided a building to Kinder-Care, the child-carecompany was able to offer its services at a discount. An existingspace cuts Kinder-Care's capital investment by roughly 25 percent,said Len Kuhn, senior vice president of development at theMontgomery, Ala., company.   Kinder-Care also can provide services cheaper than Cigna could,partly because of economies of scale and Kinder-Care'swell-developed daycare structure.   ``We have all the programs in place, all the policies andprocedures, an understanding of staffing needs, and because we havean established track record and managed our liability very well, wehave a significant difference in (the cost of) insurance,'' Kuhnsaid.
