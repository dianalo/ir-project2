(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr., a freshface in the Democratic crowd, waltzed to victory in Arkansas whileanother neighbor, Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt, was battered intodefeat by his rivals, the state's governor said.   ``I was a little surprised by how far Gephardt fell,'' Gov. BillClinton said after Gore scored a decisive win over MassachusettsGov. Michael Dukakis in the Super Tuesday Democratic primary,leaving Gephardt a distant fourth.   ``That's really the story of this election. What happened wasDukakis and Gore were attacking Gephardt. Gore and Gephardt wereattacking Dukakis. Nobody was attacking Gore on television. He gotoff with a free ride in this fight.''   Gephardt, an early front-runner in the 1988 campaign with hisIowa win, suffered a similar fate elsewhere on Super Tuesday,winning only his home state of Missouri. Gore, who stayed out ofthe national spotlight by focusing on the South, triumphed in fiveof the day's 20 state primaries.   On the Republican side, Vice President George Bush trounced Sen.Bob Dole on his way to a 16-state sweep of his Kansas rival.   Rep. Bill Alexander had little trouble defeating politicalconsultant Darrell Glascock for the Democratic nomination for the1st Congressional District of eastern Arkansas. There was noRepublican candidate in this heavily Democratic state.   With 2,541 of 2,762 precincts or 92 percent reporting, Goretallied 178,502 votes or 37 percent to Dukakis' 93,543, or 19percent, and Jesse Jackson's 85,064, or 17 percent. Gephardttrailed with 57,783 votes, or 12 percent.   Far behind were Gary Hart with 18,520 votes or 4 percent andPaul Simon with 8,981 votes or 2 percent.   Democratic candidates must attract at least 15 percent to sharein the 38 delegates up for grabs. Gore will likely get 19delegates, Dukakis 10 and Jackson nine.   With 3,366 of 4,304 precincts or 78 percent reporting, Bushtallied 123,285 votes or 64 percent to Dole's 31,279 or 16 percent.Former TV evangelist Pat Robertson had 27,192 or 14 percent and NewYork Rep. Jack Kemp was far back with 9,458 or 5 percent.   Republican candidates must get at least 3 percent of the vote toqualify for delegates. With half the precincts reporting, Bushgarnered 14 delegates to Dole's seven, Robertson's five and Kemp'sone.   Gov. Bill Clinton, who all but endorsed Dukakis, said Gorebenefited from the undecided voters.   ``Dukakis and Jackson should be very pleased,'' the Democraticgovernor said. ``Gore should be relieved. He did better than he wasexpected to do for the last couple of weeks, (although) probablynot quite as well as he hoped he'd do when he started.''</TEXT></DOC>
