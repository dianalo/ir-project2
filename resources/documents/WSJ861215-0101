The move is delighting the states, cities and towns that borrow, angering some U.S. banks, and creating anxiety about long-term dependency on foreign capital.    For a fee, these banks sell letters of credit, in effect lending their credit ratings to a municipality or local agency that issues bonds or notes. The more a bank can enhance the issuer's credit, the less the issuer has to pay to borrow money. That's where foreign banks have a big edge: seven of them have triple-A credit ratings with the two major U.S. rating concerns, compared with just two domestic banks -- both units of J.P. Morgan andamp; Co.    Foreign banks, especially Japanese, now dominate. According to Melinda Herman, an analyst at Standard andamp; Poor's Corp., foreign banks have more than 50% of the market in such letters of credit, compared with less than 10% in 1982. Other estimates put foreign banks' share at as high as 80%. In all, banks -- domestic and foreign -- wrote letters of credit on more than $60 billion of municipal bonds and notes last year, based on figures from Sandamp;P and Moody's Investors Service Inc.    Foreign financial institutions often use loss leaders or low-profit businesses to gain footholds in the U.S. and other countries. &quot;Foreign banks, particularly the Japanese, are trying to gain market share of any and all U.S. lending activities,&quot; says Andrew Aran, a bank analyst at Sandamp;P. &quot;They're blanketing the market not only in letters of credit, but also in corporate lending.&quot;    Competition has sharpened as foreign banks have muscled in. For instance, two years ago the city of Boston paid Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., a J.P. Morgan unit, 75 basis points for a letter of credit backing a $70 million short-term note. A basis point is 1/100 of a percentage point, so in this case the fee was $520,000.    Last year, the city of Boston decided to ask for competitive bids on a $100 million note. For the first time, two Japanese banks entered the fray. They lost. But this year one of them, Sanwa Bank Ltd., among the 10 biggest banks in the world, decided to upgrade its Boston office to a full branch. &quot;So,&quot; says Hideaki Yamazaki, Sanwa's general manager in Boston, &quot;we decided we had to win this at any rate.&quot;    It did -- with a bid of nine basis points, or about one-eighth of what Morgan charged two years earlier. The next two lowest bids were both from Japanese banks. The best U.S. bid was more than twice as expensive as Sanwa's.    &quot;I suspect the city of Boston would be loath to buy a fleet of Hondas for its police force,&quot; one of the losing Boston bankers, who didn't want to be named, says bitterly. &quot;But they don't have any qualms about Japanese letters of credit-because police cars are visible, but you don't see letters of credit.&quot;    Mr. Yamazaki says that at parties U.S. bankers reproach him for his low fees. &quot;They are mad, they are unhappy,&quot; he says. &quot;I tell them, 'It's a good credit. Maybe U.S. banks have been charging too much.' &quot;    At any rate, Boston's treasurer is happy. Since bothMorgan and Sanwa have triple-A ratings, there wasn't any roomfor improvement on interest costs. But, says Treasurer GeorgeRussell, &quot;Competition is a wonderful thing. Without theforeign banks, we'd probably be looking at borrowing costs inthe neighborhood of 15 to 23 basis points.&quot; Mr. Russellestimates Sanwa's bid saved the city's taxpayers at least$130,000 to $400,000 in fees.   Boston's experience isn't unusual. A few weeks ago, the Arkansas Development Finance Authority found that the top three bids for a letter of credit on a $160 million bond issue all were from Japanese banks. Wooten Epes, the agency's president, estimates the winning bid from triple-A-rated Sumitomo Bank saved it $1.8 million in fees and reduced interest costs over three years. And the Dallas Area Rapid Transit Authority says last year it saved &quot;thousands&quot; of dollars on its first major financing when Mitsubishi Bank Ltd., another triple-A-rated bank, won the bid to back a $90 million variable-rate demand note.    Besides their stellar credit ratings, foreign banks have a number of advantages. They are less encumbered than U.S. banks by reserve requirements. Many aren't as pressured to focus on quarterly profits, so they can afford to cut rates -- and profits -- to gain a foothold in a new market. Moreover, many foreign banks have more leeway because their cost of funds is lower; Japan rigidly controls the amount its banks pay on deposits, for instance.    At the same time, U.S. banks have seen their credit ratings downgraded as they wrestle with problem loans in energy, agriculture and Latin America. What's more, investment bankers, who underwrite the bonds for states and cities, have become reluctant to go to U.S. banks, which they see as direct competitors. &quot;We're afraid they're not only glad to give the letter of credit, but they'll also try to take the underwriting,&quot; says Jon Chester, an investment banker at E.F. Hutton andamp; Co.    Foreign banks are charging so little that some competitors question whether they can turn a profit. Takehiro Naruse, Mitsubishi's assistant general manager in New York, dismisses such suggestions. &quot;Mitsubishi Bank does not bid unless we make money,&quot; he says, noting that his bank wrote letters of credit for more than $1 billion in public financing last year.    Still, some U.S. banks say they've been priced out of the market. &quot;We won't compete at those prices,&quot; says Peter C. Read, head of treasury-investment banking at Bank of Boston. A Citicorp spokeswoman adds: &quot;This would be a nice business for U.S. banks to be in. But . . . where Japanese banks are bidding very, very low, it's not a profitable deal for us.&quot;    Foreign banks are particularly attracted to this low-risk business, where the default rate is considerably lower than for commercial loans. Foreign banks' share of letters of credit for tax-exempt, floating-rate financings at Hutton soared to 83% in the first six months of this year, compared with 10% in 1981, according to Steven McIntyre, an investment banker there.    Some foreign banks even are beginning to take on riskier, more creative deals. Rabobank Nederland, a Dutch bank, recently agreed to lend its triple-A rating to a $50 million pooled financing over which it will have only cursory credit review. &quot;This is just an invitation to the dance,&quot; says Brian Carty, executive director of the Massachusetts Industrial Finance Agency, which saved about $800,000 in fees and interest payments on the Rabobank deal. &quot;If this goes well, we could get $150 million more.&quot;    Still, some borrowers fret about the implications of depending on a foreign bank. The cut-rate fees mean cut-rate service. &quot;We're going to get what we're paying for,&quot; says Ronald Bean, executive director of the Illinois Development Finance Authority, who says until now he's relied on local banks for help in analyzing credits or structuring deals. But he says he'll probably choose a foreign bank to back a new pooled financing. That will mean, he says, &quot;I can't just walk across the street&quot; to talk to the bank's president.    In the long term, these borrowers admit, their fickleness on fees means they can't count on loyalty from these banks. &quot;I wonder what commitment these banks have to Arkansas,&quot; says Mr. Epes, the president of that state's development finance agency. And should Arkansas need credit badly, he fears the foreign banks would shun it. &quot;I would hate to think in the future our only choice is foreign banks,&quot; he says. &quot;But that seems to be the trend.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
