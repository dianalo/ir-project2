(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Supreme Court Justice Louis Peck canremain on the bench for at least 10 more days, as lawyers battleover whether the justice should be forced to retire because of hisage.   U.S. District Court Judge Lee Gagliardi issued a temporaryrestraining order on Thursday, stopping the state from forcing Peckoff the bench today.   The state had issued the June 30 retirement order because Peckturned 70 in December and the state Constitution requires all judgesto retire at age 70. Peck is fighting the order, saying federal lawprohibiting age discrimination supersedes the state constitutionalprovision.   Gagliardi's order allows Peck to remain on the job for 10 days,but lawyers on both sides said the order could be extended if thereis no decision within that period.   ``The understanding is that the judge will renew the restrainingorder until there is a decision in the case,'' said James Lee, theNew York regional attorney for the federal Equal EmploymentOpportunity Commission. ``This will allow Justice Peck to stay inoffice while the case is argued.''   The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is handling the caseon Peck's behalf. The commission believes the action to force Peck'sretirement constitutes age discrimination.   Peck said he was pleased by the order and is looking forward togetting a decision. ``This settles whether I have to move out thisweekend, but the case has a long way to go,'' the justice said.   The legal question is whether a federal law concerning agediscrimination should be applied to appointed state judges.   In 1986, Congress amended the federal Age Discrimination inEmployment Act to extend protections to people of all ages.Previously the act had covered people only up to age 70.   The federal law, however, does contain exceptions: electedofficers, the personal staff of elected officers and policymakingappointees. Courts in Massachusetts have ruled that appointed statejudges like Peck also should be excluded.</TEXT></DOC>
