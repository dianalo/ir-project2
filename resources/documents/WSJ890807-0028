After declining early last week, the dollar seemed to become rejuvenated and closed sharply higher Friday.    The Federal Reserve seems to be &quot;finished easing for a while. The dollar is going to strengthen a little bit,&quot; said Nancy Sotern, a futures analyst at Stotler andamp; Co. in Chicago. Relatively high U.S. interest rates have helped enhance the attractiveness of dollar-denominated investments.    Because it is considered likely the Fed will hold off on further rate reductions, &quot;the dollar is very attractive again,&quot; said Francoise Soares-Kemp, a corporate foreign exchange adviser at Credit Suisse.    Concerns about declining U.S. interest rates prompted dollar bashing early last week, as did some forecasts for a steep dollar decline near-term. But traders said the outlook changed with moderate but stronger-than-expected U.S. employment data in July, which was released Friday. The key nonfarm payrolls rose 169,000 last month after a revised June gain of 250,000, and the jobless rate fell to 5.2% from 5.3%.    The data sent market participants scrambling to buy dollars in early trading in New York because many of them had expected a nonfarm payroll rise of 150,000 or less and a steady jobless rate of 5.3%.    In late trading Friday the dollar was quoted at 1.9070 marks and 139.90 yen, up from 1.8726 and 137.25 late Thursday. The close was well above last week's intraday lows of about 1.8440 marks and 135.53 yen on Wednesday.    In Tokyo Monday, the dollar opened for trading at 139.55 yen, up sharply from Friday's Tokyo close of 138.05 yen.    &quot;Prospects for the dollar aren't so bad,&quot; said Kevin Logan, chief economist at Swiss Bank Corp. He forecasts the dollar could rise to 141 yen this week.    While the dollar had been battered by concern about possible credit-easing moves by the Fed, Mr. Logan said a play-it-safe easing approach is still considered most likely.    &quot;A steady, prudent, cautious pattern of lowering the {federal} funds rate in small steps&quot; is probable in coming months, he said, adding that such a tactic probably won't hurt the dollar.    The rate on federal funds -- reserves banks lend one another, usually overnight -- has been at about 9% since it was allowed to fall from 9 3/4 in early June. Some analysts, such as Mr. Logan, expect an 8% federal funds rate by year end.    Indications about near-term Fed policy may be evident in Wednesday's release of the central bank's &quot;beige book,&quot; a summary of economic conditions in each respective Fed district. The report will be used by the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee at its Aug. 22 meeting.    Meanwhile, the dollar is still being buoyed by flight-to-quality buying encouraged by heightened U.S.-Middle East political tensions, traders said.    &quot;There's still a lot of political unrest,&quot; and this helps the dollar, said Stotler's Ms. Sotern. She sees the dollar testing resistance at 1.92 marks and 142 yen in coming days.    Some analysts, though, don't have much faith in the dollar's renewed bullish sentiment for a number of reasons, including remaining concerns about moderating U.S. economic growth, the nation's relatively large merchandise trade deficit and the likelihood that a strong rally would be foiled by concerted central-bank intervention. Additionally, some analysts cited the lack of stability in the foreign exchange market.    &quot;The sentiment in the market swings around so fast it's astonishing sometimes,&quot; said Mr. Logan of Swiss Bank; &quot;We're not going to see a big break-out for the dollar.&quot; He said lower U.S. rate jitters could resurface quickly and knock the dollar toward support at 1.86 marks and 135 yen.    Separately, many analysts said the Canadian dollar may run into trouble this week although it is trading at its highest levels in almost eight years.    &quot;High {Canadian} interest rates are keeping buying interest alive in the Canadian dollar, but it's a very volatile currency,&quot; said a market participant.    The Canadian dollar stood at 84.87 cents in late New York trading Friday.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York Friday, gold for current delivery dropped $5.90 to $367.80 an ounce. Estimated volume was a moderate three million ounces.    In early trading in Hong Kong Monday, gold was quoted at $368.50 an ounce. </TEXT></DOC>
