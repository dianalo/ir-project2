The Commerce Department said a survey found that businesses planto spend $429.4 billion, after adjusting for inflation, topping theprevious high of $391.6 billion set in 1985.   This 11.6 percent increase over the 1987 spending total, ifrealized, would mark the biggest percentage jump since a 16.6percent rise in 1984, when American industry was still recoveringfrom the steep 1981-82 recession.   ``Capital spending is the main driving force in the economy atthe present time and there are no signs that it is going to easeoff,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co.   So far this year, business spending on plant and equipment and aboom in export sales have accounted for almost three-fourths oftotal economic growth.   The two developments are closely related, as Americanmanufacturers have rushed to expand production facilities in aneffort to meet growing overseas demand for their goods.   Sinai estimated that one-third of U.S. industry is operating atfull capacity, providing a strong incentive to boost investment.Overall, American industry is operating at 83.5 percent ofcapacity, the highest rate in eight years.   The high operating rates have led to concerns that the economyis beginning to push against capacity constraints and tight labormarkets, resulting in rising inflationary pressures.   The Federal Reserve has been pushing up interest rates sincelate March as a way of fighting inflation by dampening demand.Economists said the rate increases so far will not likely triggerany cutbacks in investment plans this year, although they expect aslowdown in 1989.   ``It takes time to make capital investment decisions so higherinterest rates won't slow this spending over the next severalmonths,'' said Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist of the NationalAssociation of Manufacturers.   ``Companies are making major increases in capital spending toexpand capacity and reduce costs through greater use ofinformation-processing equipment,'' he said, noting that half ofthe equipment spending in 1987 went to purchase computers andrelated equipment.   The new estimate of business investment plans released Thursdaywas based on company surveys completed over the past two months.   It represented only a small change from a June report thatestimated spending would rise 11.9 percent this year. Both surveysrepresented substantial gains from estimates made at the beginningof the year that investment would only climb by 7.3 percent thisyear.   In 1987, investment spending edged up a modest 2.3 percent afterhaving fallen 3.9 percent in 1986. Analysts said some of therebound this year reflected pent-up demand after two sluggishspending years.   ``This is a very typical pattern where there is a rush to spendon plant and equipment after a period of hesistation as companieswaited to be sure of the business environment,'' Sinai said.   The weakness in 1986 and 1987 was blamed on the soaring U.S.trade deficit, which sent the manufacturing sector into a slump asa flood of imports reduced domestic demand for U.S. goods at thesame time American companies were being priced out of overseasmarkets.   This year, manufacturers expect to boost spending by 12.5percent, with all durable-goods industries except automobilesplanning to boost investment over the 1987 level.   The largest increase in production of non-durable goods, thoseexpected to last less than three years, is forecast in the paperindustry. Plants there are operating at 92.8 percent of capacity,the highest level of any industry.   In non-manufacturing industries, the report predicted anincrease of 12.4 percent in capital investment by transportationcompanies, including airlines. It saw only a 1.3 percent rise ininvestment spending by public utilities, which have faced problemsof slumping electric power demand and delays in licensing nuclearplants throughout most of the decade.   The mining industry, which includes oil and gas exploration,projected a 5.5 percent increase in spending in 1988, representingonly a modest rebound after big declines in the past two yearsbecause of falling world energy prices.   Before removing the effects of inflation, business investment isprojected to rise by 10.6 percent this year to $430.9 billion,following an increase of 2.7 percent in 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
