Six radicals also were killed in a gun battle with soldiers andin attacks blamed on vigilante groups.   The deaths occurred during the previous 24 hours, the governmentstatement said.   Sinhalese militants are trying to overthrow the government,accusing it of offering too many concessions to the minorityTamils, who are mostly Hindus and make up 18 percent of thecountry's 16 million people.   The government offered the concessions in an accord signed in1987. The accord, however, failed after the most powerful of theTamil rebels groups, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelamn,rejected it saying it did not meet their expectations for autonomy.   More than 5,000 people, most of them government officials andsecurity personnel, have been killed since the Sinhalese uprisingbegan.   Tamils, who contend they are denied jobs and education by theSinhalese majority, have waged a bloody insurgency for a separatehomeland in the northeast since 1983.   The predominantly Buddhist Sinhalese comprise 75 percent of thepopulation and dominate the government and military. At least11,000 people have been killed in the 6-year-old Tamil insurgency.</TEXT></DOC>
