Without comment, the justices left intact an August 1989ruling by a federal appeals court in New Orleans that theformer employees may sue for damages under state law andaren't restricted to filing complaints with the NationalLabor Relations Board.</LP><TEXT>   The 32 workers were employed at GM's Packard ElectricDivision plant in Clinton, Miss. In 1983, the companyannounced layoffs and agreed with the union to give workersthe choice of receiving severance payments or retaining theirseniority and rehiring rights.   Under the agreement, the 32 workers chose severancepayments. When GM began hiring again in 1985, the workersapplied for jobs. They said they were told that not only hadthey given up their seniority rights but that they weren'teligible to be considered for jobs, even with a pool ofgeneral applicants.   When they sued GM, the company argued that the issuesshould be handled by the NLRB and decided under federal laborlaw. The appeals court rejected GM's arguments, ordering atrial, and the Supreme Court yesterday refused to hear GM'sappeal.   GM said it is &quot;truly disappointed&quot; at the court's action.John Maciarz, a GM spokesman, said, &quot;We plan to continue topursue the case vigorously.&quot; (General Motors Corp. vs. Wells)                                                                                                          Court in Brief                                                                                                          In other action yesterday, the Supreme Court:   -- Ruled, 9-0, that the Port Authority of New York and NewJersey, which operates airports, trains and other facilitiesfor the two states, may be sued for damages in federal courtby a worker who was injured on the job.
