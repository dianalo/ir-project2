Sease </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> STK NDX </IN><TEXT>   The program selling and profit-taking that stalled the stock market's rally Wednesday turned mean yesterday, sending prices plunging in the afternoon.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 48.24 points at 2026.03 on volume of 197.3 million shares. The volume was down from the 211 million shares that changed hands Wednesday. Declining issues were ahead of gainers, 3 to 1, on the New York Stock Exchange.    Broader market indexes also lost ground. Standard andamp; Poor's 500-Stock Index was off 5.22 to 263.84 and the New York Stock Exchange Index fell 2.56 to 148.92.    Traders and money managers said investors had been getting increasingly nervous as the stock market failed to extend its gains past the post-crash high of 2074.27 set Tuesday. When gold and oil prices began to rise yesterday morning, investors began retreating from stocks. The exodus gained momentum in the afternoon as stock-index futures reached levels at which they became underpriced in relation to the cash indexes, triggering computerized trading programs in which stocks were sold and futures contracts were bought.    But the sell-off didn't disturb many market professionals, who argued that the market's recent run-up to a new post-crash high had set the stage for a correction.    &quot;I do not believe that this is the start of a big downhill slide,&quot; said Lon Gorman, senior equities manager at First Boston Corp. &quot;The markets were slightly overbought and if we're going to generate that springboard effect that will get us past 2100 on the Dow, we had to take some fluff out of the tape.&quot;    Don Yarling, a partner in the Cleveland money management firm of Lemley, Yarling andamp; Co., said he wasn't surprised at the price drop. &quot;Anytime the market has had nothing but takeover speculation to feed on, there's been a correction,&quot; he said.    Charles Clough, chief investment strategist for Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., said he, too, had been expecting a correction. &quot;The further the market grinds up, the way this one has been doing, the more vulnerable it is to bad news,&quot; he said.    The &quot;bad&quot; news, he said, came in the form of last week's government report that showed non-farm employment in January up more than 500,000. That suggested the economy was much stronger than many analysts had been thinking and that the Federal Reserve Board wouldn't be willing to further ease interest rates. That has since been reflected in a lethargic bond market and a retreat in utility stocks prior to yesterday's sharp across-the-board plunge in stock prices.    Whether the decline continues today depends upon two government reports due out today, market analysts said. One is February retail sales, which a consensus forecast of economists suggests will show a gain of about 0.9%. And the producer price index is expected to show an increase of about 0.3%. But excluding fuel and food, the index may be up as much as 0.4% or 0.5%, intensifying inflation fears and driving down bond prices, analysts said. Further weakness in bonds could push stock prices lower.    Takeovers buoyed target stocks yesterday as new deals continued to be announced or rumored. Colt Industries shot up 4 7/8 to 18 1/8 after it said it had agreed to be acquired for $17 a share by Colt Holdings Inc., a new company formed by Morgan Stanley Equity Fund II and a senior management group of Colt Industries.    Facet Enterprises gained 3/8 to 27 3/8 after Prospect Group began a $26-a-share offer for it. Sabine rose 3 5/8 to 18 5/8 after Presidio Oil launched a $20-a-share offer for about 95% of Sabine's shares.    Moore McCormack Resources closed at 34 3/4, up 5/8. Southdown sweetened its offer for Moore McCormack to $35 a share from $31. Southdown was off 1 5/8 to 40 3/4.    Motorola dropped 3 3/4 to 47 1/4. Rumors had circulated that Ford Motor Co. would make a bid for the company. Ford fell 1 3/4 to 43 3/8.    Shares of AFG Industries plunged 5 to 31 5/8 after Forstmann Little said it won't make an offer for the company. Forstmann had earlier proposed to take AFG private at a price higher than the $33-a-share bid, to which AFG agreed, from an investor group headed by AFG Chairman Randall D. Hubbard.    Bear Stearns was off 1 to 14. Jardine Strategic Holdings, which had been rumored as a possible buyer of up to 20% of Bear Stearns shares, said it isn't interested in a stake in the firm.    Firestone gained 1/8 to 62 1/2. Italy's Pirelli Group disclosed that it had arranged a $2.3 billion borrowing facility to finance its $58-a-share bid for Firestone. Japan's Bridgestone, which had agreed to buy 75% of Firestone's world-wide tire manufacturing and wholesale business for $1.25 billion as part of a joint venture, remained silent on its plans. Traders said it would be imperative for Bridgestone to make a counteroffer if it wants to remain competitive in world markets.    Aluminum stocks fell sharply after analysts at both Prudential-Bache and Kidder Peabody downgraded their opinions of the companies' prospects. Kidder Peabody's Robert Hageman said production is outpacing consumption and that inventory levels now are the highest since August. Aluminum Co. of America slumped 3 1/8 to 44 7/8; Alcan Aluminium dropped 1 7/8 to 28 3/8; KaiserTech fell 7/8 to 11 1/2, and Reynolds Metals dropped 2 3/8 to 43 3/4.    Oil issues closed mostly lower after being higher most of the session. A Wall Street Journal story said industry executives are looking for a possible rebound in prices, especially if the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries can agree to meet on possible production cuts. Mobil eased 1/2 to 43 1/8; Phillips Petroleum fell 1/2 to 15 1/4; Atlantic Richfield lost 1/4 to 75 3/4; Exxon went down 1/4 to 41 5/8; Chevron was unchanged at 45 1/4; Sun Co. gained 1/4 to 56, and Unocal eased 1/8 to 36 5/8. British Petroleum soared on rumors that the Kuwaiti Investment Office is increasing its nearly 20% stake in the company; the stock gained 3 5/8 to close at 60 5/8. And Ranger Oil gained 1/2 to 6 on news of a North Sea oil find. </TEXT></DOC>
