The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said DeputyPrime Minister and Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach first revealedtheir new position to Thai Foreign Minister Siddhi Savetsila duringtalks in Bangkok on June 20.   A Thai Foreign Ministry official who declined to be namedconfirmed this today.   The Western official said Vietnam previously had said it wouldconsider accepting refugees only on ``a case-by-case basis,'' whichthe official said ``is their way of saying no.''   ``Now they are saying they are willing to contemplatesignificant numbers of people returning,'' said the official, whohas participated in negotiations on the issue with Indochinesecountries since at least 1982.   The new position could pave the way for cooperation withSoutheast Asian nations that have complained about a recent surgeof refugees arriving on their shores.   A United Nations refugee official today said that there were45,136 so-called Vietnamese boat people in the region's refugeecamps at the end of May, an increase of 11,664 from the previousyear.   Foreign ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nationssaid in annual talks last week that a repatriation program was oneof the new approaches needed to deal with the influx of Vietnameserefugees.   The Western official said that in the earlier stages of theVietnamese exodus by boat, which began with the communist victoryin 1975, some groups of people later returned to Vietnam.   In the past three to four years, however, few returns have beenallowed.   The Thai Foreign Ministry official said Thach told Siddhi thatVietnam was ready to hold talks on the refugee issue with Thailandand other Southeast Asian nations. He said Thach, in an unusuallyconciliatory statement, acknowledged that the influx had a``negative impact on regional countries.''   A Vietnamese Foreign Ministry spokesman said in Hanoi on July 7that Vietnam was ready to discuss the problem with countries andinternational organizations and that it was taking measures to stopthe clandestine exodus.   The British colony of Hong Kong, host to record numbers of boatpeople in recent months, last week announced it had accepted aninvitation from Hanoi for unprecedented talks on the issue.   Hopes for a resolution of the problem recently have focused onrepatriation because most people fleeing Vietnam are consideredeconomic migrants, not people subjected to political persecution.   `The proportion of genuine refugees has never been more than 10to 20 percent,'' the Western official said.   Under a proposal by the United States and other countries, theSoutheast Asian nations would relax their tough policies and allowboat people to land safely. Officials would interview arrivals toseparate economic migrants from political refugees. The refugeeswould be resettled and the economic migrants would be returned toVietnam.</TEXT></DOC>
