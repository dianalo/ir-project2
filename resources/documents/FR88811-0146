Lima, Chief, Freedomof Information Act Division, Office of the Assistant Secretary for PublicAffairs, U.S. Department of Transportation, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington,DC 20590, 202-366-4542.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>No major revision of the Departmentof Transportation's regulations implementing the FOIA has been made sincethey were promulgated in 1975 (40 FR 7915, February 24, 1975). In the interim,a need has developed for more precise criteria to be used in processingFOIA requests and FOIA appeals; for codification of procedures used informallyby the Department for notifying a submitter of confidential commercialor financial records of a request for these documents; and for additionalappendices detailing procedures used by the Maritime Administration andthe Research and Special Programs Administration, respectively, for thedisclosure of information to the public. In addition, when the FOIA wasamended by The Freedom of Information Reform Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-570,sections 1801-1804), substantial further revisions to parts of the regulationsdealing with fees and fee waivers became necessary. Finally, the issuanceof Executive Order 12600 (52 FR 23781, June 25, 1987), made it necessaryfor the Department to modify its proposed regulations pertaining to theprocessing of requests for confidential commercial information. Proposedregulations to respond to many of the needs for change were published inthe <T4>Federal Register </T4>on October 17, 1985 (50 FR 42049). Additionalproposed regulations were published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on November 6, 1987 (52 FR 42688). The finalregulations have been changed in response to comments received concerningthe two notices of proposed rulemaking.Regarding appeals, the Department is reducing from 60 to 30 days the periodin which an appeal must be submitted. When a denial is issued, the subjectrecords are retained by the responsible FOIA officer until the appeal periodexpires, longer if there is an appeal, and much longer still if the appealis denied. This retention is costly; as the number of FOIA requests hasincreased, the cost has become too burdensome. In our experience, it isnot unreasonable to expect a requester to submit an appeal within 30 days.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Comments</ITAG>The Department received three sets of public comments in response to thenotice of proposed rulemaking published on October 17, 1985 (first NPRM),and two sets of public comments in response to the supplemental noticeof proposed rulemaking published on November 6, 1987 (second NPRM).In response to the first NPRM, the Freedom of Information Clearinghouse(FOIC) objected on the general grounds that the proposed changes were unnecessaryand had not been adequately justified. The Department disagrees. It isthe Department's view that the preamble to the first NPRM included an adequateexplanation and justification for the changes then proposed. In any event,in light of the enactment of The Freedom of Information Reform Act of 1986and the issuance of Executive Order 12600, it is clear now that substantialchanges in the Department's FOIA regulations are essential.In specific comments concerning the first NPRM, FOIC objected to the proposedprocedures for processing requests for business information, proposed andSection;7.57, for three reasons. First, FOIC said it is unclear when the noticeand objection procedures apply. The Department agrees that some clarificationis needed and has revised the first sentence of proposed andSection; 7.57(a)to make it clear when the procedures apply. The wording of the final regulationalso more closely conforms to that of Executive Order 12600.The second objection by FOIC to proposed andSection; 7.57 is that the proceduresunnecessarily burden requesters by delaying the agency response. To meetthis concern, FOIC recommends that the regulations of the National HighwayTraffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), 49 CFR Part 512, be adopted foruse throughout the Department. Under these regulations, a submitter mustidentify confidential information and justify confidentiality claims atthe time the information is submitted to NHTSA. The Department does notanticipate that any significant delays will result from the codificationof the business notification procedures. Procedures similar to those inproposed andSection; 7.57 of the regulations have been used informally bythe Department for some time. Also, while the NHTSA regulation has workedwell, we are not prepared to adopt it for use by the entire Department.A significant portion of the business information submitted to NHTSA isfrom regulated parties such as automobile and tire manufacturers, and repeateddealings between NHTSA and members of regulated industries have demonstratedthe value of pre-marking information and providing accompanying justificationsin aid of evaluation of confidentiality claims. On the other hand, it isnot clear that this approach would work as well throughout the Department.Since a significant amount of business information submitted to the Departmentnever is the subject of an FOIA request, the imposition of a general requirementthat submitters assert and justify a claim for confidential treatment concurrentwith the submission of business information could produce an unjustifiedand costly burden on many members of the public and on the Department.The Department will, however, continue to evaluate this FOIC recommendationas further changes to andSection; 7.57 are considered pursuant to ExecutiveOrder 12600.Finally, FOIC points out that the proposed business information proceduresof andSection; 7.57 do not provide requesters the same notice of agency decisionsthat they provide submitters. In response to Executive Order 12600, theDepartment has changed the proposed regulation to provide notice similarto that recommended by FOIC. The regulation does not, however, requirethat the requester be provided the same information that the submitterreceives. Such a procedure would defeat the purpose of the business notificationprocedure in many cases by providing the requester with confidential commercialinformation before the submitter has had any opportunity to object.Specific objections to proposed provisions pertaining to fees and fee waiverspublished in the first NPRM were also submitted by FOIC. These objectionshave been overtaken by events and are now moot. The second NPRM, publishedin response to the Freedom of Information Reform Act of 1986 and guidelinesprovided to agencies by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and theDepartment of Justice, significantly changed the proposed fee payment andfee waiver provisions to which FOIC objected.In its comments submitted in response to the first NPRM, the Center forAuto Safety (CAS) said the proposed changes would blunt the acquisitionof important consumer information from the Department and its operatingelements by dramatically lowering the free-of-charge threshold, by increasingthe per page copy charge by 400% and by establishing a 26% surcharge forfringe benefits. As noted above, comments concerning proposed changes infees and fee waivers as published in the first NPRM have been overtakenby events. Under the revised regulations, consumers generally will havemuch greater access to information without having to pay a fee. The standardfee for photocopying has been revised downward from the earlier proposalof 20 cents per page to 10 cents per page (a charge consistent with thefigures submitted by CAS in its comments on the first NPRM), and the proposedsurcharge for benefits has been lowered to 16% in accordance with uniformguidelines provided to agencies by OMB.CAS also expressed concern that five changes proposed in the first NPRMwere subtle attempts by the Department to make it more difficult for thepublic to gain access to information. Specifically, CAS noted that: (1)Proposed andSection;andSection; 7.21 and 7.23 would delete the requirementfor immediate notice to a requester of initial and final determinations;(2) proposed andSection; 7.25 would change ``date on which a determinationis expected to be dispatched'' to ``date on which a determination is expectedto be made''; (3) proposed andSection; 7.53(d) would impose a positive dutyon the requester to provide a detailed description of a requested record,whereas the current regulation uses the word ``should'' in this regard;(4) the proposed elimination of the provision for an administrative appealwhere a requested record has not been made available would eliminate animportant intra-agency check against dilatory personnel practices; and(5) the reference in proposed andSection; 7.13 to information that the agency``wants to withhold'' suggests a departure from the longstanding policyexpressed in andSection; 7.3 favoring maximum disclosure.In proposing the changes to which CAS objected, the Department did notintend to make it more difficult for members of the public to obtain accessto information, nor does the Department agree that the proposed changeswould cause that effect. There is no necessity that the regulations includea requirement for immediate notice to a requester concerning an initialdetermination, since such notice is specifically required by the FOIA.Also, while not specifically required by the FOIA, such notice clearlyis intended with respect to a final determination as well. Nevertheless,the final regulations will make it clear that immediate notice to a requesteris required with respect to both an initial and final determination. TheDepartment agrees that the regulation should require that the requesterbe notified of the ``date on which a determination is expected to be dispatched''rather than the ``date on which a determination is expected to be made.''As CAS correctly observed, ``dispatched'' is used in the statute. The Departmentalso agrees that the wording of proposed andSection; 7.13, and proposed andSection;7.53(d) and andSection; 7.81(c) could cause confusion. Accordingly, theseprovisions have been changed in the final regulations to meet the concernsexpressed by CAS.CAS also stated that the proposed regulation may unlawfully alter and undercutthe NHTSA regulation in 49 CFR Part 512, since it does not make it clearthat 49 CFR Part 512 is the exclusive procedure for use in relation toinformation submitted to NHTSA. Proposed andSection; 7.57 has been changedto clarify this.An individual who submitted comments on the first NPRM generally supportedthe proposed changes as a vast improvement over the existing regulations.He recommended, however, that proposed andSection; 7.53(a) be modified toeliminate the positive obligation to mark an envelope to show that it containsan FOIA request, that proposed andSection; 7.95(a) be revised to take intoaccount the differences between military pay and civilian pay and fringebenefits and that the wording of the fee schedule be clarified relativeto charges for certified copies of documents. The Department agrees withthe recommendation concerning proposed andSection; 7.53(a). Accordingly,``must'' in proposed andSection; 7.53(a)(2), (3), and (4) has been replacedwith ``should'' in the final regulations. For similar reasons, ``shall''in proposed andSection; 7.53(d) has in two places been changed to ``should'',and ``must'' in proposed andSection; 7.81(e) (redesignated andSection; 7.81(d)in the final regulations) has in two places been changed to ``should.''The final regulations have also been changed to take into account the differencesbetween military pay and civilian pay and benefits. The Department doesnot agree that clarification is necessary with respect to fees chargedfor certified copies. This provision, as proposed, has been applied bythe Department without difficulty for many years.Comments on the second NPRM were submitted by The Reporters Committee forFreedom of the Press (RCFP) and jointly by Public Citizen Litigation Group(PCLG) and Freedom of Information Clearinghouse (FOIC). In general, RCFPurged the Department to reexamine and change its proposals concerning feewaiver and advance payment and to change its proposed business notificationprocedures to allow compliance with the time limitations of the FOIA.Specifically, RCFP recommended that the Department merely reiterate thelanguage of the statute concerning waiver of fees, and not include in itsregulations the fee waiver guidelines developed by the Department of Justice.RCFP also states that the proposed procedures for waiver of fees wouldviolate the Paperwork Reduction Act by requiring requesters to write separateproofs of entitlement to fee waiver or reduction. Further, according toRCFP, the proposed fee waiver provisions do not consider the legitimacyof the public's interest in monitoring the Department's activities as acriterion for granting a public interest fee waiver; appearing insteadto consider quantity of interest, magnitude of dissemination, and a hostof other irrelevant criteria. The Department disagrees. Although the statutorystandard for fee waivers is included in the final regulations, the Departmentalso believes that the guidelines developed by the Department of Justicewill be helpful when applying the general language of the statute to specificcircumstances. For that reason, the guidelines are included in the finalregulations.The Department does not agree that its proposed procedures are in conflictwith the Paperwork Reduction Act. Since that statute relates to informationcollection methods calling for answers to identical questions posed to,or identical reporting or recordkeeping requirements imposed on, ten ormore persons, it is inapplicable to the procedures prescribed in the Department'sFOIA regulations. The Department also disagrees that its proposed fee waiverprovisions fail to consider the legitimacy of the public's interest inmonitoring its activities. The Department's proposed regulations reiteratethe statute as the basic criterion for fee waivers or reductions. Additionalfactors also are stated that can be of assistance in applying the statute.Consideration of other factors is not precluded by the regulations. RCFP states that the proposed provisions for advance payment of fees willinterfere with prompt provision of information to media requesters, becausemedia requesters who had not established a record of timely payment beforeadoption of these regulations would need to await the assessment and mailingof a bill, return payment and await still other bureaucratic processesfor recording payment and certifying release. RCFP also notes that thereis no showing the requesters, particularly media requesters, have in thepast failed to pay the Department fees. The basis for this comment by RCFPis not clear. Under the proposed regulations, media requesters rarely willbe liable for any fees because of statutory fee limitations. Moreover,they frequently will be entitled to a waiver or reduction of any fees forwhich they could otherwise be liable. Advance payment, i.e., payment beforework is commenced or continued on a request, may be required under theDepartment's proposed regulations only if allowable charges are likelyto exceed $250 or the requester has failed promptly to pay fees for a priorFOIA request. These are both circumstances under which the FOIA clearlyauthorizes agencies to require advance payment of fees. It may be thatthe RCFP comment is in reference to the provisions in the proposed regulationsthat permit the collection of fees before the requested records are duplicatedor delivered. If so, the Department does not agree that these are requirementsfor advance payment of fees as that term is used in the FOIA. The Departmentinformally adopted internal procedures some time ago whereby a bill forany fees due is included in the initial determination letter and copiesof requested records are either enclosed with the determination letteror dispatched immediately upon receipt of payment. This procedure has workedextremely well, and has significantly reduced the need for repeat billingsand collection activities. The Department does not anticipate that theinclusion of this procedure in the final regulations will unnecessarilydelay the delivery of documents to requesters.RCFP urged the Department to modify its proposed regulations for notifyingsubmitters of confidential commercial information to make it clear thatthe procedures do not obviate the agency's obligation to respond to therequester within 10 working days. The Department believes that proposedandSection; 7.57 as published in the first NPRM was clear with respect tothis issue. Nevertheless, proposed andSection; 7.57 has been changed to conformto the language of Executive Order 12600.In joint comments, PCLG and FOIC said agencies must engage in full noticeand comment rulemaking with respect to fees and fee waiver provisions,should not adopt all of the fee guidelines developed by OMB and shouldreject the guidelines concerning fees waivers developed by the Departmentof Justice. The Department believes that the notice and opportunity forcomment that has been provided with respect to fees and fee waivers isadequate. Although the Department's proposed regulations did not specificallyinclude some of the guidance concerning fees that was developed by OMB,such as the definitions of ``commercial use request'', ``educational institution''and ``representative of the news media'' which PCLG and FOIC urged theDepartment to reject, the public is hereby given notice that the Departmentwill consider relevant OMB guidance, including definitions, when necessaryto determine the fees applicable to an FOIA request. The Department doesnot agree with PCLG and FOIC that in authorizing two hours of free searchtime Congress must have intended that agencies provide a requester withtwo hours of free computer operation time when requested information ismaintained in an automated data system. It is the Department's view thatthe definition developed by OMB for use in computing fees for computersearch time is reasonable and is consistent with the intent of the Congress.Accordingly, the Department has included that definition in its final regulations.The Department also disagrees that the fee waiver guidelines developedby the Department of Justice should be rejected in favor of those recommendedby PCLG and FOIC. As indicated elsewhere in the discussion of comments,the Department will rely upon the statute as the primary guide when decidingwhether a waiver or reduction of fees is required or appropriate. However,the guidelines developed by the Department of Justice have been includedin the final regulation because the Department believes they will helpwhen applying the statute. Consideration of other factors such as thoserecommended by PCLG and FOIC is not, however, precluded by the Department'sfinal regulations.In specific comments, PCLG and FOIC objected to the statement in proposedandSection; 7.97(e) that a waiver or reduction of the fees that would otherwisebe applicable to a particular request is a discretionary determinationon the part of the official(s) having initial denial authority. They statethat fee waivers or reductions are mandatory when the statutory standardis met. The Department agrees that the statute imposes a positive obligationto waive or reduce fees when the statutory standard is met, and that thesentence to which PCLG and FOIC objected could be misinterpreted. The Departmentalso finds upon further review that the sentence objected to is not necessary.Accordingly, it has been deleted from the final regulations.PCLG and FOIC also said that the provisions for advance payment of feesin proposed andSection; 7.93(e) allow the agency to require advance paymentswhere there is no history of payment for a particular requester, whichgoes beyond what the statute permits. The Department disagrees. The FOIApermits agencies to require advance payment of fees if: (1) The requesterhas previously failed to pay fees in a timely fashion, or (2) the agencyhas determined that the fee will exceed $250. Proposed andSection; 7.93(e)applies to the second situation only. Under those circumstances, the FOIAauthorizes the Department to require all requesters to pay fees in advance.However, the Department has decided not to adopt such a policy becauseit would unnecessarily delay the release of records to requesters who havea history of prompt payment of FOIA fees. Under proposed andSection; 7.93(e),advance payment may be required only if the Department has determined thatthe fees will exceed $250 and the requester has no history of payment.This is clearly permissible under the FOIA.PCLG and FOIC also objected to the Department's proposal to impose searchcharges even when no documents are found or released. They state that thiswill intimidate requesters from making legitimate requests, and that Congressnever intended or anticipated that fees would be charged where no documentswere found or released. The Department disagrees. Specific fee limitationsin the FOIA reduce the likelihood that requesters will be intimidated whenconsidering submission of legitimate requests. Also, the Department's regulationsare designed to ensure that a requester is informed in advance of anticipatedfees and given an opportunity to discuss the request with knowledgeablepersons who may be able to help avoid a needless search or a search thatis too broad. The FOIA specifically authorizes agencies to charge searchfees and, in limited circumstances, review charges. Congress undoubtedlywas aware that some agency searches will disclose no responsive records,and that even if responsive records are found they may be withheld if exempt.Therefore, it is the Department's view that if Congress had intended topermit agencies to charge only for successful searches that result in therelease of documents this limitation would have been clearly set out inthe statute, as were several other fee limitations. Accordingly, the proposedprovisions concerning search fees have not been changed in the final regulations.In addition to the changes discussed above, the final regulations havebeen changed to correct minor errors in citations and office addressesand to bring the language of the regulations into conformity with thatof statutes revised while the rulemaking project was pending. Minor editorialchanges also were made.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Evaluation</ITAG>The Department has determined that this rule is not a major rule underExecutive Order 12291 because it would have an economic impact of lessthan $10 million. However, this rule is significant under the Department'sRegulatory Policies and Procedures [44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979] sinceit concerns a matter in which there is a substantial public interest orcontroversy. The Department has also determined that the expected economicimpact of the rule is so minimal that a full regulatory evaluation is unwarranted.For this reason, I certify that, under the criteria of the Regulatory FlexibilityAct (5 U.S.C. 601, <T3>et seq.</T3>), this rule will not, if promulgated, have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This Departmenthas no reason to believe that small entities, in particular, would be seriouslyaffected by this rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 7</ITAG>Freedom of information, Administrative practice and procedure, Records.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC, on August 1, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jim Burnley,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Secretary of Transportation.</ITAG>In consideration of the foregoing, 49 CFR Part 7 is revised to read asfollows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 7_PUBLIC AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart A_Applicability and Policy</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">7.1 Applicability.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">7.3 Policy.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">7.5 Definitions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart B_General</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">7.11 Administration of part.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">7.13 Records containing both available and unavailable information.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">7.15 Protection of records.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart C_Time Limits</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">7.21 Initial determination.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">7.23 Final determination.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">7.25 Extension.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart D_Publication in the Federal Register</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">7.31 Applicability.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">7.33 Publication required.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="76">Subpart E_Availability of Opinions, Orders, Staff Manuals, Statementsof Policy and Interpretations: Indices</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">7.41 Applicability.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">7.43 Deletion of identifying detail.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">7.45 Access to materials and indices.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">7.47 Index of public materials.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">7.49 Copies.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart F_Availability of Reasonably Described Records</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">7.51 Applicability.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">7.53 Public availability of records.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">7.55 Request for records of concern to more than one Government organization.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">7.57 Request for business information submitted by a private party.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart G_Exemptions</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">7.61 Applicability.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">7.63 Records relating to matters that are required by Executive Orderto be kept secret.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">7.65 Records related solely to internal personnel rules and practices.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">7.67 Records exempted from disclosure by statute.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">7.69 Trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtainedfrom a person and privileged or confidential.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">7.71 Intragovernmental exchanges.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">7.73 Protection of personal privacy.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">7.75 Records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">7.77 Reports of financial institutions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">7.79 Geological and geophysical information.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="76">Subpart H_Procedures for Appealing Decisions Not To Disclose RecordsAnd/Or Waive Fees</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">7.81 General.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart I_Fees</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">7.91 General.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">7.93 Payment of fees.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">7.95 Fee schedule.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">7.97 Services performed without charge or at a reduced charge.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">7.99 Transcripts.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">7.101 Copyrighted material.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">7.103 Alternative sources of information.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Appendix A_Office of The Secretary</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Appendix B_United States Coast Guard</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Appendix C_Federal Aviation Administration</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Appendix D_Federal Highway Administration</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Appendix E_Federal Railroad Administration</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Appendix F_National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Appendix G_Urban Mass Transportation Administration</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Appendix H_Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Appendix I_Maritime Administration</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Appendix J_Research and Special Programs Administration</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>5 U.S.C. 552;

(b) All terms defined by the Freedom of Information Act apply to this subpart,and the term ``hourly rate'' means the actual hourly base pay for a civilianemployee or, for members of the Coast Guard, the equivalent hourly payrate computed using a 40 hour week and the member's normal basic pay andallowances.(c) This subpart applies to all employees of the Department, includingthose of non-appropriated fund activities of the United States Coast Guardand the Maritime Administration. (d) This subpart does not apply to any special study, special statisticalcompilation, table, or other record requested under 49 U.S.C. 329(c). Thefee for the performance of such a service is the actual cost of the workinvolved in compiling the record. All such fees received by the Departmentin payment of the cost of such work are deposited in a separate accountadministered under the direction of the Secretary, and may be used forthe ordinary expenses incidental to providing the information. (e) This subpart does not apply to requests from record subjects for recordsabout themselves filed in Departmental systems of records. Fees for suchrequests are to be determined in accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974,as implemented by Department of Transportation regulations (49 CFR Part10). <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 7.93 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Payment of fees. </ITAG>(a) The fees prescribed in this subpart may be paid by check, draft, ormoney order, payable to the Treasury of the United States. However, inthe case of the Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation, all feesresulting from a request to that operating element shall be made payableto the Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation. (b) Charges may be assessed by the Department for time spent searchingfor requested records even if the search fails to locate the records orthe records located are determined to be exempt from disclosure. In addition,if records are requested for commercial use, the Department may assessa fee for time spent reviewing any responsive records located to determinewhether they are exempt from disclosure. (c) When it is estimated that the search charges, review charges, duplicationfees or any combination of fees that could be charged to the requesterwill likely exceed $25, the requester shall be notified of the estimatedamount of the fees, unless the requester has indicated in advance his orher willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. The notice shallalso inform the requester how to consult with appropriate Departmentalofficials with the object of reformulating the request to meet his or herneeds at a lower cost. (d) Payment of fees may be required by the Department prior to actual duplicationof delivery of any releasable records to a requester. However, advancepayment of fees, i.e., payment before work is commenced or continued ona request, may not be required unless: (1) Allowable charges that a requester may be required to pay are likelyto exceed $250; or (2) The requester has failed to pay within 30 days of the billing datefees charged for a previous FOIA request.(e) When paragraph (d)(1) of this section applies, the requester shallbe notified of the likely cost and, where he or she has a history of promptpayment of FOIA fees, requested to furnish satisfactory assurance of fullpayment. Where no history of payment exists, the requester may be requiredto make advance payment of any amount up to the full estimated charges.(f) When paragraph (d)(2) of this section applies, the requester shallbe required to demonstrate that the fee has, in fact, been paid or to paythe full amount owed, including any applicable interest, late handlingcharges and penalty charges as discussed below. The requester shall alsobe required to make an advance payment of the full amount of the estimatedfee before processing of a new request or continuation of a pending requestis begun. (g) The Department will assess interest on an unpaid bill starting on the31st day following the day on which the notice of the amount due is firstmailed to the requester. Interest will accrue from the date of the noticeof amount due and will be at the rate prescribed in section 3717 of Title31, U.S.C. Receipt by the Department of a payment for the full amount ofthe fees owed within 30 calendar days after the date of the initial billingwill stay the accrual of interest, even if the payment has not been processed.(h) If payment of fees charged is not received within 30 calendar daysafter the date the initial notice of the amount due is first mailed tothe requester, an administrative charge will be assessed by the Departmentto cover the cost of processing and handling the delinquent claim. In addition,a penalty charge will be applied with respect to any principal amount ofa debt that is more than 90 days past due. Where appropriate, other stepspermitted by federal debt collection statutes, including disclosure toconsumer reporting agencies and use of collection agencies, will be utilizedby the Department to encourage payment of amounts overdue. (i) In any instance where the Department reasonably believes that a requesteror a group of requesters acting in concert is attempting to break downa single FOIA request into a series of requests for the sole purpose ofevading the payment of otherwise applicable fees, the Department will aggregatethe requests and determine the applicable fees on the basis of the aggregation.(j) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subpart, when the totalamount of fees that could be charged for a particular request (or aggregationof requests) under Subpart F, after taking into account all services whichmust be provided at no charge or at a reduced charge, is less than $10.00the Department will not make any charge for fees. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 7.95 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Fee schedule. </ITAG>(a) The standard fee for a manual search to locate a record requested underSubpart F of this part, including making it available for inspection, willbe determined by multiplying each searcher's hourly rate plus 16 percentby the time spent conducting the search. (b) The standard fee for a computer search for a record requested underSubpart F of this part is the actual cost. This includes the cost of operatingthe central processing unit (CPU) for the time directly attributable tosearching for records responsive to a FOIA request and the operator/programmersalary (hourly rate plus 16 percent) costs apportionable to the search.(c) The standard fee for review of records requested under Subpart F ofthis part is the reviewer's hourly rate plus 16 percent multiplied by thetime he or she spent determining whether the requested records are exemptfrom mandatory disclosure. (d) The standard fee for duplication of a record requested under SubpartF of this part is determined as follows: (1) Per copy of each page (not larger than 8\1/2\andmultiply;14 inches) reproducedby photocopy or similar methods (includes costs of personnel and equipment),$0.10. (2) Per copy prepared by computer, such as tapes or printout, Actual costs,including operator time. (3) Per copy prepared by any other method of duplication, Actual directcost of production. (e) Depending upon the category of requester, and the use for which therecords are requested, in some cases the fees computed in accordance withthe above standard fee schedule must either be reduced or not charged,as prescribed by other provisions of this subpart. (f) The following special services not required by the FOIA may be madeavailable upon request, at the stated fees: Certified copies of documents, with Department of Transportation or operatingelement seal (where authorized), $4.00, or true copy, without seal, $2.00.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 7.97</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Services performed without charge or at a reduced charge.</ITAG>(a) No fee is to be charged to any requester making a request under SubpartF for the first two hours of search time unless the records are requestedfor commercial use. For purposes of this subpart, when a computer searchis required two hours of search time will be considered spent when thehourly costs of operating the central processing unit used to perform thesearch added to the computer operator's salary cost (hourly rate plus 16per cent) equals two hours of the computer operator's salary costs (hourlyrate plus 16 percent).(b) No fee is to be charged for any time spent searching for a record requestedunder Subpart F if the records are not for commercial use and the requesteris a representative of the news media, an educational institution whosepurpose is scholarly research, or a non-commercial scientific institutionwhose purpose is scientific research.(c) No fee is to be charged for duplication of the first 100 pages (standardpaper, not larger than 8\1/2\andmultiply;14 inches) of records provided toany requester in response to a request under Subpart F unless the recordsare requested for commercial use.(d) No fee is to be charged to any requester for review of a record requestedunder Subpart F to determine whether it is exempt from disclosure unlessthe records are requested for commercial use. A review charge may not becharged except with respect to an initial review to determine the applicabilityof a particular exemption to a particular record or portion of a record.A review charge may not be assessed for review at the administrative appeallevel. When records or portions of records withheld in full under an exemptionwhich is subsequently determined not to apply are reviewed again to determinethe applicability of other exemptions not previously considered, this isconsidered an initial review for purposes of assessing a review charge.(e) Documents will be furnished without charge or at a reduced charge ifthe Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs, or his or her designee, orofficial(s) having initial denial authority, as the case may be, determinethat disclosure of the information is in the public interest because itis likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operationsor activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercialinterest of the requester.(f) Factors to be considered by officials of the Department authorizedto determined whether a waiver or reduction of fees will be granted include:(1) Whether the subject matter of the requested records concerns the operationsor activities of the Federal government;(2) Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute to an understandingof Federal government operations or activities;(3) Whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute tothe understanding of the public at large, as opposed to the individualunderstanding of the requester or a narrow segment of interested persons;(4) Whether the contribution to public understanding of Federal governmentoperations or activities will be significant;(5) Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furtheredby the requested disclosure; and (6) Whether the magnitude of any identified commercial interest of therequester is sufficiently large in comparison with the public interestin disclosure that disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest ofthe requester.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 7.99</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Transcripts.</ITAG>Transcripts of hearings or oral arguments are available for inspection.Where transcripts are prepared by a nongovernmental contractor, and thecontract permits the Department to handle the reproduction of further copies,Subpart I applies.
