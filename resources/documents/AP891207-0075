Hussein Kamel, minister of industry and militaryindustrialization, said on state-run Baghdad radio that thethree-stage rocket was launched at 8:30 a.m. Tuesday from theAl-Anbar space research center.   He also claimed that Iraq has developed two othersurface-to-surface missiles with a range of 1,240 miles. If true,this would double the reach of Iraq's missile arsenal.   The heaviest missile the Iraqis are believed to have developedis the al-Hussain weapon with a range of around 560 miles.   There was no independent confirmation of the launch.   The report did not specify the missile's flight path or saywhere the research center is located. Kamel said the 48-ton rocketwill be used to launch a satellite for scientific research. He saidit used a 70-ton first-stage launch vehicle, far bigger thananything the Iraqis were believed to possess.   He said the launch was the first stage of an Iraqi spaceresearch program.   Oil-rich Iraq is the only Arab country to have claimed it hasthe capability of launching satellites into space. If true, thiscould enable it to develop a military satellite to spy on Israeland Iraq's rivals in the region.   Israel is the only Middle East country known to have satellitecapability.   President Saddam Hussein of Iraq has been driving to develop anaerospace industry for some time and has spent billions of dollarson missile development.   The most ambitious part of the program was developing amulti-stage ballistic missile with Egypt and Argentina based onArgentina's Condor missile.   The radio report quoted Kamel as telling Saddam in a telegramannouncing the launch that the rocket was built at Iraqimilitary-industrial research centers. But intelligence officialsand diplomats have been skeptical for some time about such claims.   Israel launched the Ofek-1 satellite Sept. 19, 1988, from amilitary base south of Tel Aviv. It said Ofek-1 was designed forscientific research, but Arab governments fear it will be used as aspy satellite.   Israel has said it is working on an Ofek-2 satellite. The Sovietnews agency Tass reported that the Israelis launched a ballisticmissile Sept. 14.   Israel denied it, but Western intelligence agencies believe thereported firing could have been an abortive effort to launch Ofek-2into orbit.   If the Iraqis have acquired the potential to put a satelliteinto space, the Iranians and Syrians would be concerned.   Iran and Iraq fought an eight-year war that was halted by acease-fire last year, but peace talks have deadlocked and bothsides are rearming.   Syria is Saddam's archrival in the Arab world and was alliedwith Iran against Iraq during the war.   A spy satellite capability would greatly enhance Saddam'smilitary might and would erode Israel's long-held technologicalsuperiority, already threatened by the buildup of long-range,surface-to-surface missiles by Iraq, Iran, Syria and Saudi Arabia.Libya too is seeking a missile arsenal.</TEXT></DOC>
