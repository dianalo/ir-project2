 That spells trouble.andP;  Specifically, yourproblem becomes one or both of the following: You know the name of the fileyou're looking for, but not where it resides on your hard disk; or you knowthe data you want, but not the name of the file it is in.andM;Either way, there are three strategies you can use to make it easier to findthe files you're looking for:andM;* Simplify the search.andP;  This includes adopting file-naming conventions thatmake it easier to identify files, building identifying sections intoworksheets, and reducing the number of files stored on your hard disk.andM;* Divide and conquer.andP;  This includes using subdirectories to separate andorganize disk content, and using 1-2-3's and Symphony's subdirectorynavigation commands to locate desired files.andM;* Buy a utility program.andP;  A utility program will help you organize and finddisk-based files.andP;  Among these programs are Norton Commander, The WorksheetUtilities, ViewLink, and Lotus Magellan.andM;Three Ways To SimplifyandM;the SearchandM;1.andP;  Make space.andP;  A quick way to find a needle in a haystack is to reduce thesize of the haystack.andP;  So it is with finding a file on a hard disk.andP;  Make ahabit of deleting unnecessary files.andP;  Archiving inactive files on removablemedia--floppy disks, cartridges, tapes, or even Bernoulli Boxcartridges--frees up hard-disk space without sacrificing access to the files.andM;Archiving does take time.andP;  But it's time you'll save later, when you look forfiles.andP;  Another problem with archiving is that most people forget to do itconsistently.andP;  To ensure that it gets done, set up a schedule.andP;  If yourcomputing activity isn't unusually heavy, consider archiving once a month.andO;Archiving to free up space should not take the place of normal hard-diskbackups.andP;  You can combine archiving with backing up with a program called PCLibrarian (United Software Security, Vienna, Va.).andP;  It allows you to removefiles from your hard disk as you make back-up copies of them.andM;2.andP;  Adopt a file naming convention.andP;  Establish a common method of namingfiles.andP;  In most cases, DOS's eight-character file-name limit prevents youfrom clearly differentiating the contents of one file from another.andP;  You canreduce the confusion substantially, however, if you use the first fourletters of a file name as a person or subject identifier.andP;  Use the last fourletters for date coding or subcoding.andP;  For example, you might assign the nameRCVBJUNE to a file containing June's account receivable data.andP;  You can alsoassign three-letter file-name extensions that identify file content.andP;  Forexample, use extensions such as .CTR for contract worksheets, .BGT for budgetfiles, or .RCV for receivables worksheets.andM;To save a file with a unique file-name extension in the current subdirectory,using 1-2-3 Release 2/2.01, select /File Save (in Symphony, SERVICES FileSave), enter the coded file name, and press Return.andP;  In 1-2-3 Release 1A, youcannot specify a file extension when you save a file.andP;  The programautomatically assigns the .WKS extension.andP;  Since 1-2-3 and Symphony initiallypresent at the File Retrieve command only files with Lotus-specificextensions (.WR1, .WK1, and so on), you'll need to intervene.andP;  In the currentdirectory, to retrieve a 1-2-3 file that has a unique file extension, select/File Retrieve, enter *.*, and select the file the way you normally do.andP;  InSymphony press SERVICES File Retrieve and follow the same procedure.andM;Assigning unique file-name extensions has another advantage.andP;  You can searchfor file groups with the DOS DIR command.andP;  For example, entering the DOScommand dir *.bgt will present all the files in the current directory thathave the .BGT file extension.andM;The drawbacks of adopting naming conventions include the need for disciplineto use them and the need to remember the conventions you've established.andP;  Jogyour memory on both counts by taping a note that lists the conventions you'reusing to the top of your keyboard.andM;3.andP;  Create a title area.andP;  With a little forethought, you can make it easierto identify worksheet files.andP;  Even after you've retrieved a worksheet, youoften waste time browsing through it to see if it contains the informationyou want.andP;  To save time, record basic identifying information in theupper-left corner of the worksheet.andP;  This title area can contain a shortexplanation of the worksheet's purpose or function, the name of its creator,and the date of its most recent revision.andP;  If you have to load a worksheet tosee what's in it, the title area can save you from searching through thewhole worksheet.andM;Two Ways to Divide and ConquerandM;1.andP;  Use subdirectories.andP;  Subdirectories divide the relatively huge storagecapacity of hard disks into manageable and meaningful segments.andM;DOS lets you create as many subdirectories as you want.andP;  You're limited onlyby disk space and the 63-character limit of a directory-path listing.andP;  Thesubdirectory scheme you adopt is entirely up to you.andP;  One subdirectorytechnique that frequently works well is using a separate subdirectory foreach application program and its associated data files.andP;  For example, youmight install 1-2-3 in a subdirectory called C:\123, WordPerfect in asubdirectory called C:\WP, and dBase in a subdirectory called C:\DB.andP;  Youwould then store 1-2-3 worksheet files in the C:\123\ FILES subdirectory,WordPerfect text files in the C:\WP\FILES subdirectory, and dBase data filesin the C:\DB\FILES subdirectory.andP;  An advantage to this scheme is that you canupdate your application programs without disturbing data files.andM;If you store your data in a separate subdirectory from your program files,you need to tell 1-2-3 or Symphony where to look for your data.andP;  Use theWorksheet Global Default Directory command (in Symphony, SERVICESConfiguration File) to set the default directory.andP;  Once you set the default,use the Update command to save your default-directory selection.andM;2.andP;  Use directory navigation commands.andP;  The 1-2-3 Release 2/2.01 and Symphonydirectory navigation commands provide a quick way to locate a worksheet fileby name.andP;  Rather than selecting /File Retrieve (in Symphony, SERVICES FileRetrieve) and scanning five file names at a time across the control panel,you can press the NAME key (in Symphony, MENU) to view a full-screen displayof up to 105 file names at a time.andP;  Then choose your file by placing thepointer on the desired file name and pressing Return.andM;You can change directories while you are viewing a list of files within 1-2-3Release 2/2.01 or Symphony.andP;  When you press Backspace, you move to thedirectory immediately above the directory you are in.andP;  1-2-3 or Symphony thenpresents a list of worksheet files and subdirectories in the new directory.andM;You can also move down a level to a subordinate subdirectory by highlightingit and pressing Return.andP;  This displays all the worksheet files andsubdirectories in the subordinate subdirectory.andM;Seven Utility Programs You Can BuyandM;1.andP;  Norton CommanderandM;This DOS-enhancement program includes several useful utilities for findingfiles.andP;  The Find File command searches an entire hard disk and displays allfiles that match a file name and extension criterion you've specified.andP;  Sinceyou can use DOS wildcard search characters with this command, you don't haveto know the precise name of the file you're seeking.andM;The Norton Commander View command allows you to examine the contents of1-2-3, Symphony, dBase II, dBase III, and ASCII text riles.andP;  When you view1-2-3 and Symphony worksheet files in this way, they appear similar to theoriginal program screen (see figure 1).andP;  dBase files are displayed one recordat a time, with field names and field contents on one screen.andP;  Text filesappear in full-screen presentation.andM;You can also use the program to sort directories by file name, fileextension, file size, and file-creation date, all of which may help youlocate the file.andM;2.andP;  The Worksheet UtilitiesandM;This program includes six add-ins you can use directly from within 1-2-3.andO;One add-in, FileWorks, helps you find files in three ways (see figure 2).andO;The most useful of these lets you attach a 240-character description to afile.andP;  You can display the description and the file name in a directory-stylelisting.andP;  FileWorks also lets you attach up to eight keywords to a file.andO;These keywords are drawn from a list of up to 64 words you've defined, andyou can search for files by keyword.andP;  The add-in also lets you attach anowner's name to a file.andM;FileWorks lets you look at a file in either worksheet or text format withouthaving to load the file.andP;  You can sort directories by the usual name,extension, date and file size, and search all the files within a directoryfor worksheet files containing specified labels and range names.andM;3.andP;  PC Tools Deluxe 5.0andM;This program includes two helpful tools for finding files.andP;  The Locate Filecommand lets you search all subdirectories to find a file if you know thefile name or any part of the name.andP;  The Search Disk command matches textstrings you specify to similar text strings in nonworksheet files.andP;  Onceyou've found a file, you can look at its contents without loading the programthat created it.andM;4.andP;  XTreeProandM;This general-purpose program for managing a disk provides several methods forfinding files.andP;  If you know the name of the file but not its location, youcan use the program to search any of your disk drives to find files matchingthe name criteria you supply.andP;  XTreePro also lets you sort directories byfile name, file extension, file size, or file-creation date and time.andP;  Sortscan be in either ascending or descending order.andP;  Once files are sorted, it'soften easy to recognize the one you want.andM;XTreePro's View command displays the contents of text files on the screen.andO;The program includes many other disk-management and productivity features,and it lets you look simultaneously at the contents of several drives on asingle screen.andM;5.andP;  Lotus MagellanandM;This program provides a host of functions to help you manage a hard disk andlocate files.andP;  It lets you index your hard disk and quickly search the entiredrive by file type, file content, or by a combination of both.andP;  It looks foreither exact or similar matches to your specified string of characters, andduring the search, each selected file is assigned a score that represents thedegree to which a file matches your criteria.andP;  The program lists the filenames in descending order of match scores, with the most promising match atthe top.andP;  If you wish, you can name the search-criteria and save it for lateruse.andP;  A typical Magellan screen appears in figure 3.andM;The program also provides an easy way to peruse the files themselves.andP;  As youmove your cursor through a list of files on the left side of your screen,Magellan displays the contents of each highlighted file on the right side ofthe screen.andP;  If the file was created with 1-2-3, Symphony, dBase, or one ofseveral word processing programs, Magellan displays the file as it appears inthe original program.andP;  You can move around inside a file using the originalprogram's file-navigation keys, but you cannot change anything.andM;Once you've found the file you want, Magellan lets you use it.andP;  If the filewas created by a program for which Magellan has a driver, you canautomatically start the application program that created the file (assumingyou have the application program on your hard disk) and load the file you areexamining.andM;6.andP;  ViewLinkandM;This program lets you see groups of related files, or &quot;Views,&quot; no matterwhere those files are stored or in what program they were created.andP;  You cangroup files based on type, file name, file content, file-creation date, orany combination of these factors.andP;  Once you set up one or more Views, anyfiles that match the criteria specified for a View will automatically belinked to it.andM;Like Magellan, ViewLink can start other programs and load their data files.andO;If the file was created by one of over 50 popular application programs,ViewLink will start the program and automatically load the file you want.andP;  Itisn't necessary for an application program to be on a disk for ViewLink torecognize a file's origin, but the application program must be there in orderto run.andM;7.andP;  ReTreeveandM;Here's a program that is designed exclusively to help people find files.andO;ReTreeve uses a filing-cabinet metaphor that arranges files into &quot;folders&quot; bysubject, regardless of where they reside on a hard drive.andP;  With this programyou can give a file a 64-character comment and put a &quot;carbon copy&quot; of it intoany number of folders.andP;  Each folder can have its own sort sequence; forexample, onee can be in chronological order,  another in keyword order.andO;Keywords are chosen from either the comment text or the file content.andM;The program also indexes you entire hard disk.andP;  An average of less than 5% ofthe total drive content is used for the index file.andP;  Once a drive is indexed,you can search the disk for files by any character sequence.andP;  ReTreeve alsoallows you to point to a file, automatically start the application programthat created it, and load the file.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
