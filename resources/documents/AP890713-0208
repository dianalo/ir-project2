The three rifles, one shotgun and three pistols are said to bethe ones used in the attack by Charles Whitman. In all, Whitmankilled 16 people and wounded 31 others. He killed his mother and hiswife before climbing the 307-foot tower in the center of the Austincampus, where he was a student.   Police stormed the tower and killed Whitman, 25.   Austin Police Capt. Robert Gross said Thursday that the guns usedin the attack were turned over to Whitman's estate and were latersold at auction.   The guns have been advertised by Wayne Buxton in the past threeissues of a gun collectors' publication, the AustinAmerican-Statesman and the Houston Chronicle reported Thursday.   The American-Statesman said Buxton instructed editors of``Shotgun News'' not to divulge his name or phone number to callers.The newspaper said it linked the post office box number given in theclassified ad to Buxton, who owns a gun and pawn shop in the Dallassuburb of Garland.   Buxton did not return telephone calls Thursday to his home andshop from The Associated Press.   The gun dealer told the newspapers he doesn't want to discusswhat the ads call The Whitman Colection because ``there's too muchpain in the state of Texas'' associated with the slayings.   ``I have no interest whatsoever in resurrecting pain or any sadfeelings,'' he said. ``It's a source of pain to certain people, andI don't want to get into that.''   The Chronicle said Buxton, who is seeking $7,500 for thecollection, would not say how he obtained the weapons, but claimsthey are authentic. He said he is not a Whitman relative.   KDFW-TV in Dallas said Buxton told the station he does not ownthe weapons, but is acting as the agent for the owner, whom he wouldnot identify.   The ad offers the guns, a radio, binoculars, cameras and a knifefor money or in trade for historical Winchester rifles or Coltpistols, the Chronicle said. The ad also offers a copy of a 1966Life magazine reporting the slaughter.</TEXT></DOC>
