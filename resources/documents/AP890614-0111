Voters in the other seven EEC countries go to the polls Sunday.   Elections will be held Thursday in Britain, Denmark, Ireland, theNetherlands and Spain. But ballots will be counted only after voterschoose among candidates in West Germany, Luxembourg, France, Italy,Portugal, Belgium and Greece.   In all, 7,126 candidates are vying for seats in the 518-memberassembly. They represent 178 parties across the political spectrum.   Pre-election polls say Socialists and Christian Democrats, whohold 166 and 112 seats respectively in the outgoing assembly, willremain the largest factions, and might even make gains.   Green Party candidates are expected to do well in West Germany,the Netherlands, France, Belgium, Spain and Portugal and winsubstantially more than the 20 seats they held previously.   In Ireland, Luxembourg and Greece, voting for the EuropeanParliament coincides with national legislative elections.   But even in countries where no general election is planned soon,campaigning for the European elections has focused largely ondomestic issues.   In Britain, the opposition Labor party has turned the electionsinto a referendum on Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's 10 years inoffice, rather than on its views of European integration.   In Italy, campaigns also took on a domestic tinge and voteresults will affect the makeup of the next coalition government.Italy's 48th postwar government collapsed last month.   And in Spain, which joined the EEC in 1986, the campaign iswidely seen as a warm-up for general elections that must be held by1991.   Issues such as the EEC single market project, under whichEurope's internal borders will disappear by Dec. 31, 1992, havebarely been explained to voters who seem confused about what theparliament is and what it does.   The assembly is one of three institutions directly involved inthe EEC's lawmaking process.   But unlike the EEC Commission and the Council of Ministers, bothof which are based in Brussels, the parliament straddles threenations: its committees meet in Brussels, its headoffice is inLuxembourg and its plenary sessions are held monthly in Strasbourg,France.   While the parliament lacks a high profile, it gained additionalpowers on July 1, 1987, forcing the EEC Commission and the Councilof Ministers to pay more attention to the parliament's views.   The parliament must now be consulted on any single market issuesinvolving the environment, research and technology, occupationalhealth and safety and certain measures to harmonize laws amongnations.   It must also approve some EEC treaties with other countries andapplications for EEC membership. It can amend or reject the EEC'sannual budget, fire the 17-member EEC executive Commission or delayan opinion on draft EEC legislation to keep it from taking effect.   The parliament also plays a growing role in internationalaffairs. Former President Ronald Reagan, Argentine President RaulAlfonsin, King Hussein of Jordan, PLO leader Yasser Arafat and PopeJohn Paul II have addressed the body in recent years.   The parliament cannot, however, initiate EEC legislation.   The outgoing parliament comprises eight political ``groups,''representing 79 political parties sitting in alignments of theright, center and left.</TEXT></DOC>
