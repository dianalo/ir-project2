The agreement, thrashed out in more than a month of talks thatconcluded late Thursday night, minimally meets next year's goal ofreducing the deficit to $100 billion, while putting off the toughchoices until later.   It allows the president to claim he won't violate his campaignpledge against new taxes, and he agreed to lower his defensespending plans so that Congress could avert a squeeze on populardomestic programs.   ``The budget agreement does not complete the wholedeficit-reduction job ... but I am convinced that we will only beable to complete that job if we tackle it in manageable steps on anorderly basis in a constructive bipartisan spirit,'' Bush said.``And this is a first manageable step.''   ``This is not an heroic agreement,'' said House Speaker JimWright, D-Texas. ``If we begin with the assumption that there canbe no significant major increase in revenue, this agreement isabout as good as we could do.''   ``No one should be deluded into thinking that this is the end ofthe process,'' said Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,D-Maine. ``Much sterner measures will be required in the future.''   Bush and the House and Senate leadership sealed the deal in amorning meeting in the Cabinet Room, and then announced it at aRose Garden ceremony.   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, the chairman of the Senate FinanceCommittee, attended the meeting with the president but refused tojoin in the announcement.   ``He declined to go out in the Rose Garden and have his picturetaken because he doesn't like the agreement,'' said Jack Devore,Bentsen's spokesman.   The senator told the president ``that he thought the budget wasmarginal, that he's concerned that it depends on wildly optimisticeconomic assumptions and there remains a great gulf between theCongress and the administration on how you raise the $5.3 billionin new taxes Bush is calling for,'' Devore said.   The plan claims to reduce the fiscal 1990 deficit to about $99.4billion, meeting the goal of the Gramm-Rudman law of a deficit nolarger than $100 billion in the year beginning Oct. 1.   The deficit next year would be about $126.6 billion undercurrent government policies, compared with about $163 billion thisfiscal year, according to administration estimates.   About half of the deficit reduction, $14.2 billion, would comefrom a combination of increased revenues including $5.8 billion intaxes, $2.7 billion in fees for government services and $5.7billion from selling government assets, according to sourcesfamiliar with the package.   Details of the revenue sources were left unspecified, to beworked out later as Congress and its committees draft thelegislation to implement the pact. The budget agreement itself doesnot have the force of law, but it will provide a framework for theactual spending bills passed later.   The tax figure includes $500 million through increasedenforcement of the tax code, but achieving the other $5.3 billionwill either mean finding taxes that Bush doesn't believe violatehis campaign pledges, or Congress acceding to Bush's claim thatcutting the capital gains tax rate will bring in more revenue, notless.   Bush wants a lower capital gains tax and says it would actuallyincrease revenue in fiscal 1990 because of an increase in that typeof financial activity. Democrats argue that the plan is a bigrevenue loser in the long run, with the wealthy sopping up most ofthe benefits.   On the spending side, the plan would restrain overall growth forfiscal 1990 in both domestic and military programs to below therate of inflation.   The Pentagon would be held to about $299 billion in outlays,virtually the same as this year. Military spending authority, whichincludes commitments that span more than one fiscal year, would beabout $305.5 billion.   Current cost controls in the Medicare health plan would beextended and other restraints would be imposed on that fast-growingentitlement, without cutting benefits. Overall spending bygovernment agencies would be increased with the rate of inflation,although the Congress and Bush would presumably cut some programsto make room for additional spending in others.   Even before the agreement was announced, negotiators were sayingthat more needed to be done, especially if the deficit path is tocontinue downward and reach the $64 billion goal for fiscal 1991.Deep spending cuts or significant tax increases would be needed tomeet that goal, the negotiators concluded, and they decided againsttackling it in the current round of talks.   Rep. Bill Frenzel of Minnesota, senior Republican on the HouseBudget Committee, called the result ``something of adisappointment.''   ``It does not make substantial reductions in our spending''although it slows the upward trend. ``It isn't what I had hopedfor,'' he said.   ``It's going to make the work for next year very difficult,'' hesaid.   A big chunk of the deficit plan is made up of one-shot savingsand accounting gimmicks that don't lessen the long-term deficitproblem.   Sales of government assets, which are frequently loanportfolios, often cost the Treasury in the long run.   The plan lists $1.9 billion in savings from reduced payments tofarmers, but more than half of that would be by paying farmersearly so the checks are written this fiscal year instead of next.More than $3 billion of the other ``savings'' in the plan come fromaccounting changes, such as moving the postal service ``offbudget.''   The plan also claims that by rejecting its pay raise earlierthis year, Congress saved $100 million.   More than $1 billion of the deficit reduction is calculatedbecause the government would pay less interest because of thesavings in the rest of the plan.   Although the plan claims to reduce the deficit to slightly belowthe $100 billion Gramm-Rudman ceiling, the law does not count the$5.7 billion in asset sales toward that target.   The plan also relies on administration economic assumptionswhich are widely regarded as too optimistic. If the economy doesnot meet those expectations of strong growth and low interestrates, the real deficit will exceed the one calculated in advancefor the purposes of the Gramm-Rudman law.   If Congress and the president fail to enact spending and taxbills that, at least on paper, bring the deficit to within $10billion of Gramm-Rudman's $100 billion target, the law requires theadministration to cut military and domestic spending across theboard. Only Social Security and welfare programs are exempt fromsuch cuts.</TEXT></DOC>
