The Pentagon, as part of an in-depth review of big-ticketweapons programs by Secretary Dick Cheney, said it wants tobuy 1,292 of the new lightweight Army helicopters at anannual rate of 120. They'd replace the current fleet of AH-1,OH-6 and OH-58 choppers at a cost of $34.2 billion.Previously, the Pentagon had planned to buy 2,096 LHs at acost of $42 billion.</LP><TEXT>   Critics in Congress have questioned the cost of thehelicopter, its necessity in light of the diminished Sovietthreat and its ability to survive attack from the ground. Inaddition, the Senate has voted to require that the Army buildprototypes of the helicopter before it starts assembling afinal production model. The Army originally had planned torely just on engineering analyses before putting productiontooling in place.   In its decision, announced Friday, the Pentagon largelyacquiesced to the Senate requirement, saying it would buildsix prototypes before deciding on a production model. Thefirst LH helicopters for actual use now are expected to comeoff the production line in December 1998, about two yearslater than scheduled. &quot;We're falling in line&quot; with theSenate's position, said an Army spokeswoman.   Yet given the effort by some lawmakers, especially Rep.Larry Hopkins (R., Ky.), to scuttle the LH programcompletely, the Pentagon's long-awaited call to push aheadwith development was greeted by the contractors on theproject as welcome news.   They cited, in particular, Mr. Cheney's assertion that theArmy's current fleet of helicopters does &quot;not meet theprojected threat.&quot; In a letter dated Thursday to Senate ArmedServices Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D., Ga.), the secretarymaintained that &quot;the collapse of the Warsaw Pact does notalter the need for the LH,&quot; saying that crises such as theone currently in the Persian Gulf &quot;require a versatile andmore flexible force.&quot;   &quot;In light of all the programs that the Pentagon hascanceled or has gone back to a study phase on, we're pleasedwith its decision,&quot; said Al Haggerty, director of a team madeup of McDonnell Douglas Corp. and Textron Inc.'s Belldivision -- one of two teams competing for the LH accord.&quot;We're talking about hundreds of people that could have beenout of work had they zeroed it,&quot; he said.   The other team is made up of Boeing Co. and UnitedTechnologies Corp.'s Sikorsky subsidiary. The Army plans tochoose between the two teams in February 1991. The industryhas already poured a total of about $450 million into the LH.   A Sikorsky spokesman said he couldn't comment as to whatthe Army's newly proposed production rate of 10 a month mightmean for his team. But Mr. Haggerty asserted: &quot;This will keepthe momentum going, the technology moving.&quot; The new rate, hesaid, would allow for adequate efficiency and &quot;certainlyisn't something that anybody in the industry would turn theirnose up at.&quot;   Still, the Pentagon announcement doesn't end the program'spolitical problems. The House Armed Services Committee, forinstance, has approved language calling for the Army to scrapthe LH and come up with an improved design, which it callsthe Scout attack helicopter. &quot;We want them to go back to thedrawing board,&quot; a committee spokeswoman said. Mr. Haggertycountered, however, that the measure being advanced by theHouse panel seems more a matter of semantics than substance;the LH's mission, he insisted, hasn't been changed.   The Pentagon describes the LH as an armed reconnaissancehelicopter that can perform at night, in bad weather and inhot climates with a range unmatched by current helicopters.</TEXT></DOC>
