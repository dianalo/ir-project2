The ban imposed on 43 styles of semiautomatic weapons _ includingthe popular Chinese-made AK-47 and Israeli-made Uzi carbine _followed a four-month study by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco andFirearms on whether the weapons met the standards imposed by the GunControl Act of 1968, which barred importation of weapons that arenot used for legitimate sporting purposes.   ``The study was undertaken because of the dramatic increase inthe number of these weapons being imported and police reports oftheir use in violent crime,'' said Stephen E. Higgins, director ofthe ATF bureau.   While the 43 were banned permanently, another seven whose importshad been suspended since early spring will be available for importagain as a result of the study. Those include six .22 rimfirecaliber rifles and a gun called the Valmet Hunter, which had beenconsidered an AK-47 type of weapon during the suspension.   Higgins said the ATF, which studied the marketing and use of theweapons, said the models banned were ``not being used for sportinguses.'' Such weapons were identified officially Friday as``semiautomatic assault rifles.''   The ATF annually traces 35,000 to 40,000 guns used in crime, andabout 10 percent of them are semiautomatic assault weapons, Higginssaid, estimating that slightly more than half of them were domesticmakes that are not subject to ATF control.   ``We're not saying that it will solve the basic problem'' ofcrime, Higgins said, adding, ``Their use in crime is probablydisproportionately high compared with the number that are here.''   Holding aloft one of the banned weapons _ an Israeli-made Galilrifle _ Higgins pointed out some of the accoutrements that led toits prohibition: a folding stock, a night sight, a flash suppressoron the end that could serve as a grenade launcher, its ability toaccept a bayonet lug, a pistol grip and a large magazine.   In the future, he said, weapons with several of these featuresprobably also would be subject to an import ban.   Higgins estimated that the Customs Service has seized about20,000 of the weapons and that those will not be allowed into thecountry unless purchased by law enforcement agencies. Asked whetherthe government will pay damages to importers, Higgins said, ``That'ssomething the court would decide.''   Three importers already have brought suit against the governmentover the suspension, and although a district court has upheld thegovernment in one of the cases, Higgins said the ATF would acceptcomments on the permanent ban from any importers for 30 days. Thefinal regulations would be issued ``very quickly'' after that, hesaid.   Asked why the ATF previously had allowed imports of thenow-banned weapons, Higgins said the committee set up after the 1968law was passed to determine whether guns qualified for import had``concentrated primarily, almost exclusive, on handguns.'' It wasn'tuntil the number of assault-style weapons being imported increaseddramatically that the ATF focused on them, he said.   The action Friday was lauded by gun control advocates, but WayneLaPierre, executive director of the NRA Institute for LegislativeAction, said it was ``inconsistent with the rights guaranteedlaw-abiding American gun owners under the Second Amendment to theConstitution. The National Rifle Association will fight thisdecision in the courts, on Capitol Hill and at the ballot box.''   John M. Snyder, spokesman for the Citizens Committee for theRight to Keep and Bear Arms, said the ban ``shows theundependability of government, because originally, the ATF hadcertified that these rifles could be imported because they aresuitable for sporting purposes.   ``I think it also tends to further undermine whatever credibilityPresident Bush has left with the firearms-owning community in theUnited States,'' he added.   Bush, a hunter and a lifetime member of the National RifleAssociation, came into office opposing any bans on the assault-styleweapons, despite an outcry over their increasing popularity amongdrug gangs and a heightened public concern triggered by the Januaryschoolyard slayings of five children in Stockton, Calif., by a manwielding an AK-47.   However, Bush asked William J. Bennett, the director of theOffice of National Drug Control Policy, to advise him on what to doabout the weapons. In March, at Bennett's urging, Treasury SecretaryNicholas Brady suspended the imports of many of the weapons, andBush expanded the list the following month.   The ATF, which has the power to control imports, does notregulate domestic manufacture of weapons, so similar weapons made inthe United States would not be affected by the action. Several billspending in Congress would control or eliminate many of the U.S.-madeassault-style weapons.   The ATF has estimated that domestic makes account forthree-quarters of the 3 million semiautomatic rifles now owned byAmericans. Colt Industries Inc. suspended sales of its AR-15, themost popular of the domestic assault semiautomatic rifles, in March.   Sarah Brady, chairwoman of Handgun Control Inc., praised theATF's action as Bush's ``leadership in working toward reducingassault weapon violence by stopping the import of these weapons ofwar.   ``I urge the president and the Congress to continue in thedirection of public safety by passing legislation to stop thedomestic production of assault weapons,'' said Mrs. Brady, whosehusband, former White House press secretary Jim Brady, was severelywounded in the 1981 assassination attempt on President Reagan. ``Itis no more acceptable to have citizens being gunned down by killingmachines wearing a `Made in the USA' label than by those madeabroad.''   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, and Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif.,who have authored bills that would severely limit or end futuresales of domestically produced semiautomatic assault-style weaponsas well as imports, echoed Mrs. Brady's views.   ``The president's ban on imported assault weapons cannot make ourstreets safer unless we also ban American-made assault weapons,''said Metzenbaum. The senator said some domestic makes also ``arefavored by drug dealers and street gangs and are used against policeofficers and innocent citizens.''   Said Stark: ``The president's decision to ban imported assaultweapons while ignoring domestic ones is a glaring loophole.''   The NRA has argued vociferously against limits on the rights oflaw-abiding citizens to own the weapons and has urged a crackdown oncriminals rather than imposition of new gun-control laws.   The weapons banned come primarily from China, Israel, WestGermany and Belgium. Others are made in Austria, Australia, Italyand Switzerland, among other countries.</TEXT></DOC>
