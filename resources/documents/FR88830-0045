These revisions were developedin response to the 1984 Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments to the ResourceConservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). This proposed action would amendPart 257 by including information requirements for certain solid wastedisposal facilities and by excluding municipal solid waste landfills (MSWLFs)from Part 257. In addition, this action would add a new Part 258, whichspells out specific requirements for MSWLFs.Amended Part 257 would establish notification and exposure informationrequirements for owners and operators of industrial solid waste disposalfacilities and construction/demolition waste landfills. The new Part 258sets forth revised minimum Criteria for MSWLFs, primarily in the form ofperformance standards, including location restrictions, facility designand operating criteria, ground-water monitoring requirements, correctiveaction requirements, financial assurance, and closure and post-closurecare requirements.EPA believes that the provisions in today's proposal are necessary forthe protection of human health and the environment and take into accountthe practicable capability of owners and operators of municipal solid wastelandfills. The Agency is requesting comment on the overall approach proposedand on specific components of the proposal.Today's proposal also is intended to fulfill a portion of EPA's mandateunder section 405(d) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) to promulgate regulationsgoverning the use and disposal of sewage sludge. Under today's proposal,Part 258 would be co-promulgated under the authority of the CWA; this authoritywould apply to all municipal solid waste facilities in which sewage sludgeis co-disposed with household wastes. A separate regulation for sludgemonofills (landfills in which only sewage sludge is disposed of) is beingprepared for future proposal under 40 CFR Part 503. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Comments on this proposed rule must be submitted on orbefore October 31, 1988.

Part 257</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">B. Part 258</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">I. Authority</ITAG>These regulations are being proposed under the authority of sections 1008,4004, and 4010 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976. Section1008 directed EPA to publish guidelines for solid waste management, includingcriteria that define solid waste management practices that constitute opendumping and are prohibited under Subtitle D of RCRA. Section 4004 furtherrequired EPA to promulgate regulations containing criteria for determiningwhich facilities are sanitary landfills and which are open dumps. In response,EPA promulgated the ``Criteria for Classification of Solid Waste DisposalFacilities and Practices'' (40 CFR Part 257) in 1979. Section 4010, addedby the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), directs EPAto revise those Criteria promulgated under sections 1008 and 4004 for facilitiesthat may receive household hazardous waste (HHW) or small quantity generator(SQG) hazardous waste. For municipal solid waste landfills in which sewage sludge is disposedof together with household wastes, the Part 258 regulations also are beingproposed under the authority of section 405 (d) and (e) of the CWA. Section405 regulates the use and disposal of sewage sludge generated by treatmentworks treating domestic sewage. Section 405 requires that EPA develop standardsfor sludge use and disposal, including: An identification of the majoruse and disposal practices, factors to be taken into account in determiningapplicable measures and practices for each use or disposal, and concentrationsof pollutants that interfere with each use or disposal. When the CWA wasamended in February 1987, additional requirements were added to section405. Congress directed EPA to identify toxic pollutants that may be presentin sewage sludge in concentrations that may adversely affect public healthand the environment and to establish numerical limitations and managementpractices for each identified pollutant for each use of disposal option.The numerical limitations and management practices are to be adequate toprotect public health and the environment from any reasonably anticipatedadverse effects of each pollutant. Further, the amendments require thatthese section 405(d) sludge standards be implemented through National PollutantDischarges Elimination System (NPDES) permits issued to publicly ownedtreatment works (POTWs) or other treatment works treating domestic sewageunless the standards have been included in a permit issued under RCRA SubtitleC; the Safe Drinking Water Act; the Marine Protection, Research and SanctuariesAct; the Clean Air Act; or a State permit where the State program has beenapproved as ensuring compliance with section 405. In addition section 405(e)prohibits any person from disposing of sludge from a POTW or other treatmentworks treating domestic sewage except in accordance with the section 405(d)regulations. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Background </ITAG>Subtitle D of RCRA establishes framework for Federal, State, and localgovernment cooperation in controlling the management of nonhazardous solidwaste. The Federal role in this arrangement is to establish the overallregulatory direction, to provide minimum standards for protecting humanhealth and the environment, and to provide technical assistance to Statesfor planning and developing environmentally sound waste management practices.The actual planning and direct implementation of solid waste programs underSubtitle D, however, remain State and local functions. Section 405(d)-(f) of the CWA establishes a comprehensive framework forregulating the use and disposal of sewage sludge. Section 405(d) providesfor the Federal promulgation of numerical limitations and management practicesgoverning the use and disposal of sludge. Section 405(e) provides for Federalenforcement of these standards. Section 405(f) requires the implementationof these regulations through permits issued to POTWs under section 402of the CWA, unless they have been included in a permit issued under SubtitleC of RCRA or other authority listed in that section. The permits are tobe issued by EPA or by a State with a program that has been approved asensuring compliance with section 405 of the CWA. A. Current Subtitle D CriteriaUnder the authority of sections 1008(a)(3) and 4004(a) of RCRA, EPA promulgatedthe ``Criteria for Classification of Solid Waste Disposal Facilities andPractices'' (40 CFR Part 257) on September 13, 1979. EPA issued minor modificationsto these Criteria on September 23, 1981. These Subtitle D Criteria establishminimum national performance standards necessary to ensure that ``no reasonableprobability of adverse effects on health or the environment'' will resultfrom solid waste disposal facilities or practices. A facility or practicethat meets the Criteria is classified as a ``sanitary landfill''; a facilityfailing to satisfy any of the Criteria is considered an ``open dump'' forpurposes of State solid waste management planning. State plans developedunder the ``Guidelines for Development and Implementation of State SolidWaste Management Plans'' (40 CFR Part 256) must provide for closing orupgrading all existing ``open dumps'' within the State. The existing Part 257 Criteria include general environmental performancestandards addressing eight major topics: Floodplains (andSection; 257.3-1),endangered species (andSection; 257.3-2), surface water (andSection; 257.3-3),ground water (andSection; 257.3-4), land application (andSection; 257.3-5),disease (andSection; 257.3-6), air (andSection; 257.3-7), and safety (257.3-8).The following briefly summarizes these provisions. Section 257.3-1 specifies that facilities or practices in floodplains shallnot interfere with the floodplain or result in washout of solid waste soas to pose a hazard to human life, wildlife, or land or water resources.Section 257.3-2 prohibits solid waste disposal facilities and practicesthat cause or contribute to the taking of any endangered or threatenedspecies or result in the destruction or adverse modification of the criticalhabitats of such species. The surface water provision, andSection; 257.3-3,specifies that disposal facilities shall not cause a discharge of pollutantsor dredged or fill material to waters of the United States that is in violationof section 402 or 404 of the CWA. Section 257.3-4 lays out the ground-waterprotection standards, which require that facilities and practices not exceedthe Safe Drinking Water Act maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) in an undergrounddrinking water source beyond the solid waste unit boundary or beyond analternative boundary specified by the State. Section 257.3-5 requires that a facility or practice meet certain restrictionswith respect to the concentrations of cadmium and polychlorinated biphenyls(PCBs) contained in waste applied to land used for producing food chaincrops. Section 257.3-6 specifies that waste disposal facilities and practicesmust institute appropriate disease vector controls, such as periodic applicationof cover material. In addition, andSection; 257.3-6 requires pathogen reductionprocesses for sewage sludges and septic tank pumpings applied to land.The air criterion in andSection; 257.3-7 prohibits open burning of solidwaste (with certain exceptions) and specifies that the applicable requirementsof the State Implementation Plans developed under section 110 of the CleanAir Act must be met. Finally, the safety provisions of andSection; 257.3-8require control of explosive gases, fires, bird hazards to aircraft, andpublic access to the facility. Currently, EPA does not have the authority to enforce these existing Part257 Criteria directly, except in situations involving the disposal or handlingof POTW sludge. Federal enforcement of POTW sludge handling facilitiesis authorized under the CWA. The existing Criteria, as they apply to non-sludge-handlingfacilities, are enforced by the States through State regulatory programsor by citizens through the citizen suit provisions of section 7002 of RCRA.B. Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984In 1984, Congress made significant modifications to Subtitle D of RCRAthrough the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments. As described below, themajor modifications to Subtitle D include requirements that EPA completea Subtitle D study and revise the Part 257 Criteria, and that States implementrevised permitting programs. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Subtitle D Study and Report to Congress</ITAG>HSWA added a new section 4010 to RCRA, which requires EPA to ``conducta study of the extent to which the guidelines and Criteria under this Act(other than guidelines and Criteria for facilities to which Subtitle Capplies) which are applicable to solid waste management and disposal facilities* * * are adequate to protect human health and the environment from groundwater contamination.'' This study is to include a detailed assessment ofthe adequacy of the Criteria regarding monitoring, prevention of contamination,and remedial action for protecting ground water and also is to identify``recommendation with respect to any additional enforcement authoritieswhich the Administrator, in consultation with the Attorney General, deemsnecessary.'' EPA anticipates submitting a Report to Congress on the resultsof the study shortly.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Criteria Revisions</ITAG>Section 4010 also required EPA to revise the Subtitle D Criteria by March31, 1988, for facilities that may receive household hazardous waste orhazardous waste from small quantity generators. These revisions must bethose necessary to protect human health and the environment, but, at aminimum, should require ground-water monitoring as necessary to detectcontamination, establish location standards for new or existing facilities,and provide for corrective action, as appropriate. Section 4010 furtherstates that EPA may take into account the ``practicable capability'' offacilities to implement the Criteria. Today's proposal represents the firstphase of the Agency's promulgation of these mandated revisions.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Implementation and Enforcement</ITAG>HSWA amended section 4005 of RCRA to require States to establish by November8, 1987, a permit program or other system of prior approval to ensure thatfacilities that receive HHW or SQG hazardous waste are in compliance withthe existing Part 257 Criteria. Within 18 months of promulgation of revisedCriteria, each State must modify its permit program to ensure compliancewith the revised Criteria. If the Administrator determines that a Statehas not adopted an adequate permit program, EPA may enforce the revisedCriteria at facilities that may receive HHW or SQG waste.C. Current Sewage Sludge CriteriaThe existing Part 257 Criteria discussed above were co-promulgated underthe joint authority of RCRA and section 405(d) of the CWA. The Part 257regulations thus apply to all sludge land disposal practices, except distributingand marketing sludge. Because these regulations apply to sewage sludge,they are directly enforceable by EPA against any person found to be inviolation of them. In February 1987, Congress enacted the Water Quality Act of 1987, whichamended portions of the CWA, including section 405. First, Congress expandedsection 405(d) to impose new standard-setting requirements with associateddeadlines. Second, Congress established new sludge permitting requirementsin section 405(f) along with State program requirements. EPA currentlyis developing sludge regulations to be proposed under section 405(d) andpublished in 40 CFR Part 503. In addition, EPA already has published aproposed regulation in 40 CFR Part 501 that would implement the requirementsof section 405(f) (53 FR 7642, March 9, 1988). The comment period for theselatter regulations closed on May 9, 1988.The Part 503 regulations, when promulgated, will address the incineration,ocean disposal, land application, and distribution and marketing of sludge.Lastly, and most relevant here, they also will regulate sludge monofills,which are landfills in which only sewage sludge is disposed of (i.e., noother type of solid waste is co-disposed of with the sewage sludge). Thoseregulations will not, however, contain regulations for the co-disposalof sewage sludge with household wastes. Regulations for the co-disposalof sewage sludge and household wastes, rather, are part of today's proposal.By this action, the Agency seeks to achieve consistency in its regulationunder two legal authorities of a single disposal practice_the co-disposalof sewage sludge and other solid wastes in municipal solid waste landfills.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Nature and Scope of the Problem</ITAG>To fulfill its responsibilities under HSWA, EPA has conducted a seriesof studies and analyses of solid waste characteristics, waste disposalpractices, and environmental and public health impacts resulting from solidwaste disposal. Preliminary results of these studies were summarized inthe ``Subtitle D Study Phase I Report,'' issued in October 1986 (Ref. 34).Final results, which form the basis for Agency decision making for thisrule, are incorporated in EPA's Subtitle D report to Congress, which isexpected to be issued shortly. The key studies pertinent to today's proposalare summarized below. Copies of the reports mentioned below are availablefor public review in the docket for this rulemaking.A. EPA Studies of Solid Waste Management<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Analysis of Solid Waste Characteristics</ITAG>To analyze the characteristics of solid waste, EPA conducted numerous studiesto determine the volume, characteristics, and management methods of wastesregulated under Subtitle D. These studies revealed that more than 11 billiontons of solid waste are generated each year, including 7.6 billion tonsof industrial nonhazardous waste (which includes about 55.8 million tonsof electric utility wastes), 2 to 3 billion tons of oil and gas waste (includingboth drilling wastes and produced wastes), more than 1.4 billion tons ofmining waste, and nearly 160 million tons of municipal solid waste.Several Subtitle D wastes currently are being addressed under separateAgency efforts and thus were not examined in detail in EPA's Subtitle Dstudy. In particular oil and gas wastes, utility wastes, and mining wastehave been the subject of special studies conducted under section 8002 ofRCRA and are being considered separately for rulemaking. In addition, theAgency currently is closely evaluating, in a separate effort, the characteristicsand management practices for municipal waste combustion ash. Thus, thefollowing discussion focuses on the characteristics of municipal solidwaste, household hazardous waste, and small quantity generator hazardouswaste, which are the primary waste streams addressed by today's proposal,as well as industrial solid waste.In 1986, EPA sponsored a study entitled ``Characterization of MunicipalSolid Waste in the United States, 1960 to 2000'' (Ref. 16). This studyexamined the quantity and composition of municipal solid wastes and forecastthe characteristics of municipal solid wastes in the U.S. through the endof the century. The study found that, on average, more than 50 percentof municipal solid waste comprises paper, paperboard, and yard wastes;nearly 40 percent is metals, food wastes, and plastics; and the remaining10 percent is wood, rubber, leather, textiles, and miscellaneous inorganics.Waste composition was found to be highly site-dependent and influencedsignificantly by climate, season, and socioeconomic factors. The studydetermined that approximately 150 million tons of municipal solid wastewere generated in 1984 (of which more than 126 million tons were landfilled)and that the waste volume was expected to increase significantly by theend of the century. EPA recently completed an update to this study entitled,``Characterization of Municipal Solid Waste in the United States, 1960-2000(Update 1988)'' (Ref. 17). This update estimated that 158 million tonsof municipal solid waste were generated in 1986. In October 1986, EPA published ``A Survey of Household Hazardous Wastesand Related Collection Programs,'' which analyzed the existing informationon characteristics of HHW and reviewed HHW collection programs (Ref. 30).This study indicated that common discarded household products, such ashousehold cleaners, automotive products, paint thinners, and pesticides,may contain hazardous wastes that are either listed under Subtitle C orexhibit one or more hazardous characteristics. Household wastes, includingHHW, currently are exempt from regulation under Subtitle C of RCRA.A third study, ``Summary of Data on Industrial Nonhazardous Waste DisposalPractices,'' compiled available data on industrial solid waste characteristicsand land disposal practices in 22 major manufacturing industries (Ref.29). This study estimated that roughly 390 million metric tons of industrialnonhazardous waste are generated by these industries each year, that 35percent of these wastes are managed on site, and that 75 percent of thesewastes are generated by four industries: Iron and steel, electric powergeneration, industrial inorganic chemicals, and plastics and resins. Additionalinformation on industrial nonhazardous waste quantities was provided bythe Industrial Facility Screening Survey (Ref. 35), which estimated thatapproximately 7.6 billion tons of industrial nonhazardous wastes are generatedeach year. The survey is described in more detail below. In 1985, EPA also conducted the ``National Small Quantity Generator Survey,''which characterized SQG waste volumes and disposal practices (Ref. 14).(For purposes of this study, SQGs were defined as those operations yieldingless than 1,000 kilograms of hazardous waste per month.) This survey indicatedthat SQGs annually produce 940,000 metric tons of hazardous waste, consistinglargely of lead-acid batteries, solvents, and strongly acidic or alkalinewastes. Furthermore, the survey found that solid waste disposal facilities,including MSWLFs, are the second most frequent destination for SQG hazardouswaste shipped off site. EPA estimates that MSWLFs may receive from 5 percentto 16 percent of the SQG hazardous waste produced.Existing information on MSWLF leachate, summarized in the background documenton MSWLF leachate quality (Ref. 8), indicates that leachate from MSWLFsgenerally contain a wide range of inorganic and organic hazardous constituentsin varying concentrations. Landfill gas comprises 50 to 60 percent methane,40 to 50 percent carbon dioxide, and less than 1 percent hydrogen, oxygen,nitrogen, and other trace gases.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Review of Waste Disposal Practices</ITAG>EPA conducted numerous studies to gather existing information on the numbersof Subtitle D facilities, facility design and operating characteristics,leachate and gas characteristics, and environmental and human health impactsassociated with different types of facilities. EPA relied on several keysources of information on the number and design and operating characteristicsof Subtitle D facilities for this proposal. The first major source wasan EPA mail survey of State solid waste management programs conducted in1985 to gather information on State Subtitle D programs and facilities.The final report on the survey, ``Census of State and Territorial SubtitleD Nonhazardous Waste Programs'' (State Census), was issued in 1986 (Ref.46).The State Census indicated that there are about 227,000 Subtitle D disposalfacilities, excluding waste piles (which were not included in the survey).This total includes approximately 16,500 landfills, 191,500 surface impoundments,and 19,000 land application units. In addition, the State Census indicatedthat there are more than 145,000 oil and gas waste or mining waste facilities,which EPA is addressing in separate efforts.The States estimated that roughly 37,000 Subtitle D facilities (or 16 percentof all the facilities) may receive hazardous wastes from households orfrom small quantity generators. The States' estimate of 16,500 landfillsincluded approximately 9,300 MSWLFs; however, the States subsequently identifiederrors in the numbers reported for MSWLFs and submitted revised figures.These revised State figures and the results from EPA's 1986 municipal solidwaste landfill survey, which was a random sample of approximately 1,250MSWLFs nationwide, indicate that there are a total of 6,034 MSWLFs (asof 1986). The MSWLF survey also provided detailed information on MSWLFdesign and operation.In developing this rule, EPA also utilized the results of an industrialfacility screening survey, which involved a telephone screening of nearly30,000 establishments in 22 industries. The primary purpose of this screeningsurvey was to provide EPA with basic information on the universe and characteristicsof industrial solid waste disposal facilities.In general, information on Subtitle D disposal facilities is limited, exceptfor MSWLFs. While new MSWLFs are expected to be better located, designed,and operated, the following observations can be made regarding the universeof existing MSWLFs. According to the State Census, MSWLFs are distributedthroughout the country, occurring in virtually every hydrogeologic setting,and generally concentrated near more populated areas; they are owned predominantlyby local governments (80 percent), with the remainder owned by privateentities (15 percent), the Federal Government (4 percent), and State governments(1 percent). Approximately 42 percent are small (less than 10 acres) and52 percent dispose of small amounts of waste (less than 17.5 tons per day);only 15 percent are designed with liners (natural or synthetic) and only5 percent have leachate collection systems. Current data also indicatethat only 25 to 30 percent of MSWLFs have some type of ground-water monitoringsystem. Results from the 1986 MSWLF survey generally are consistent withthese results.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Assessment of Impacts</ITAG>Impacts associated with MSWLFs and industrial Subtitle D facilities aredescribed below. Existing data indicate that some MSWLFs are adverselyaffecting the environment and could harm human health. Industrial solidwaste facilities need to be examined more closely to determine their impacts.<T3>a. Municipal Solid Waste Landfills.</T3> State inspection data, casestudy evidence, risk characterization studies, waste and leachate characteristics,and the current limited use of design controls indicate that some MSWLFshave degraded the environment and that this degradation could continue.Older landfills are of most concern because they may have received largevolumes of hazardous waste and, in general, their use of design controlswas very limited; however, existing data are not sufficient to conclusivelydemonstrate that MSWLFs currently are harming human health, other thandata indicating acute impacts associated with methane releases. Currenthuman health impacts from past exposure to contaminant releases from MSWLFsare difficult to isolate due to the complex interaction of factors thataffect human health. However, the Agency's recently completed risk assessmentsindicate that MSWLFs present future potential risks to human health.More than 500 MSWLFs, or about 25 percent of MSWLFs with ground-water monitoringsystems, were reported by States to be violating a State ground-water protectionstandard, although the nature and extent of these violations are unknown.In some States, any detectable degradation of the ground water is considereda violation. Most facilities do not monitor for organic hazardous constituentsin ground water, so these violations represent analyses for a limited setof pollutants. States also reported that 845 MSWLFs were cited for air-relatedviolations (many of which are likely to be odor-related incidents), and660 MSWLFs were cited for surface water contamination. Some of these violationsmay have been reported at sites established before existing State and Federalregulations were in place.EPA has summarized case study information documenting ground-water andsurface water contamination incidents (Ref. 7). Evaluation of 163 MSWLFcase studies revealed ground-water contamination at 146 facilities andsurface water contamination at 73 facilities. For most of these landfills,information on the waste received either was not available or was incomplete,although a limited number are known to have received hazardous waste beforethe Subtitle C regulations were issued. At about 50% of the facilitieswith ground-water contamination, specific contaminants were identified.The most common constituents were iron, chloride, manganese, trichloroethylene,benzene, and toluene. At several sites, drinking water sources were contaminated.Ground-water contaminant plumes characterized at three of the sites extendedto (or nearly to) the base of an aquifer at depths of approximately 70feet (at two sites) and 300 feet (at one site).The plume from one site migrated one-half mile downgradient of the landfill,while the plume at another site migrated almost one and one-half milesdowngradient.Typically, those facilities causing ground-water contamination were morethan 10 years older than facilities reporting no impacts. Ground-waterimpacts appeared to be more severe in locations characterized by high netinfiltration rates and high ground-water flow rates. Most facilities thathad contaminated ground water were located close to the ground-water table,underlain by highly permeable soils, or had no or very limited engineeringcontrols. The case study information identifies several factors that maybe related to failure at a particular facility, specifically the landfill'sage, location, and engineering design; however, it is unknown whether thissample is representative of the universe of MSWLFs, and it is not possibleto isolate the specific factors responsible for each failure.Analysis of damage cases involving methane indicates that methane mustbe controlled to protect human health. Methane is produced in MSWLFs throughanaerobic decomposition of organic waste and is explosive at sufficientlyhigh concentrations (the lower explosive limit). Existing Federal regulationsrequire that the concentration of explosive gases should not exceed 25percent of the lower explosive limit in facility structures and shouldnot exceed the lower explosive limit at the facility boundary. Methaneis produced in such abundance that methane collection projects are in placeat approximately 100 landfills for the primary purpose of resource recoveryand energy production. Where methane is not controlled, fires and explosionshave occurred. In 23 of 29 damage cases studied, methane has been measuredin concentrations above the lower explosive limit at distances up to 1,000feet off site. Explosions and fires, both on site and off site, have occurredin 20 of the 29 cases, loss of life has been documented in five instances,and injuries have been reported in several others. Most of these siteswhere injuries or death occurred did not have a landfill gas control system.EPA also examined the characteristics of landfills on the Superfund NationalPriorities List (NPL) in May 1986 (Ref. 26). Of the 850 sites listed orproposed for listing on the NPL (in May 1986), 184 sites (22 percent) wereidentified as MSWLFs. In addition, of the 27,000 sites in the Superfunddata base, almost one fourth are MSWLFs. In general, the MSWLFs on theNPL were poorly located and designed. Because most of the NPL sites werein operation before 1980 (the effective date of EPA's hazardous waste rules)and may have received hazardous wastes in addition to Subtitle D wastes,they are not representative of newer, better designed and operated MSWLFs;however, these sites indicate the extent to which older and poorly located,designed, and managed landfills can harm the environment. Current dataindicate that 70 percent of existing MSWLFs were in operation prior to1980. The State data, case study information, and NPL study were supplementedby a risk assessment of MSWLFs (Ref. 10). The risk assessment was completedusing the Subtitle D Risk Model, which was developed to evaluate the risksand resource damage associated with ground-water contamination at MSWLFsand to identify the factors that affect the nature, extent, and severityof environmental impacts from these facilities. The model simulates pollutantrelease, fate, and transport; exposure; impacts; and corrective action.The model is described in more detail in Section XI of this preamble. Caveats to the risk and resource damage analysis results presented in therisk assessment need to be recognized. First, the risk and resource damagemodeling includes considerable uncertainty. The model components that introducethe most uncertainty are those that predict leachate quality for traceorganics, the probability and consequences of containment system failure,and the human health risk resulting from exposure to toxic substances (e.g.,the dose-response models). Second, the model estimates effects from newlandfills, but does not analyze the risk and resource damage impacts fromexisting facilities. The risk analysis estimates the human health risk for the maximum exposedindividual (i.e., the mean of the average lifetime risk over the 300-yearmodeling period of the facility) and the total population using groundwater as a drinking water source within one mile of the facility. Currentdata indicate that 54 percent of existing MSWLFs have no downgradient drinkingwater wells within one mile, a finding that strongly influences model resultsbecause current data and model limitations do not allow the risk to beestimated at facilities with drinking water wells beyond one mile. Thus,under this model, such facilities are considered to pose no risk. Using the well distribution indicated by the MSWLF survey (i.e., no drinkingwater wells located within one mile of 54 percent of the landfills), therisk model estimates that, in the baseline, fewer than 1 percent of MSWLFspose risk greater than 1andmultiply;10<T2>^4</T2> (i.e., an exposed individual would have a greater than onein ten thousand chance of contracting cancer in his or her lifetime asa result of the exposure), 5.5 percent pose risk in the 1andmultiply;10<T2>^5</T2> to 1andmultiply;10<T2>^4</T2> range, and 11.6 percent pose risk in the 1andmultiply;10<T2>^6</T2> to 1andmultiply;10<T2>^5</T2> range. Overall, approximately 17 percent of MSWLFs pose risksgreater than 110andmultiply;<T2>^6</T2>. Out of the eight leachate constituents modeled, the threeprincipal constituents contributing to human health risk are vinyl chloride,1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane, and dichloromethane. For landfills located within one mile of a drinking water well (46 percentof all landfills), 14 percent pose risk exceeding 1andmultiply;10<T2>^5</T2> , and nearly 40 percent pose risk greater than 1andmultiply;10<T2>^6</T2>. If future wells are located near existing MSWLFs (or new sitesare located near current wells), the overall risk distribution may be closerto the estimates for this subgroup. The overall risk distribution changessignificantly if it is assumed that all drinking water wells are locatedat the facility boundary (assumed to be 10 meters from the landfill unit).Using this conservative scenario, it is estimated that approximately 35percent would pose risk greater than 1andmultiply;10<T2>^5</T2>, and about 67 percent of MSWLFs would pose risk exceeding 1andmultiply;10<T2>^6</T2>. Because risk is the result of a complex interaction among many factors(some of which have not been accounted for in this analysis), no singlefactor is responsible for most of the variation. Thus, in addition to welldistance, the results of the analysis identified other risk-contributingfactors, which include infiltration rate, facility size, and aquifer characteristics.These factors are similar to those identified in the case studies discussedabove. More detailed discussion of EPA's risk assessment is provided laterin this preamble. <T3>b. Sewage Sludge Disposal in MSWLFs. </T3>EPA estimates that approximately6,800 POTWs dispose of their sludge in MSWLFs. This represents the sludgedisposal practice used by 44 percent of all POTWs. The total volume ofco-disposed sewage sludge is slightly under 3 million tons per year, whichis approximately 40 percent of the volume generated annually by POTWs.EPA has not performed a separate risk assessment addressing the sludgecomponent of municipal solid waste landfills. Sludge typically is a smallcomponent of the landfill (i.e., 5 percent). It is not technically feasibleto monitor separately the fate and transport of the sludge and its constituentsfrom the fate and transport of other wastes in the landfill and their constituents.Moreover, while there has been some research on the interaction of sludgeand other wastes in a co-disposal situation, there are as yet no definitiveresults from such work. Therefore, the discussion above on the practicesand risks associated with MSWLFs constitutes the best current informationon those landfills that receive sludge together with the other wastes.<T3>c. Industrial Subtitle D Facilities. </T3>In 1985, about 28,000 industrialsolid waste land disposal facilities handled approximately 7.6 billiontons of waste. Although few data on specific health and environmental impactsof these facilities are available, the large volume of waste and numberof facilities present concerns about actual and potential threats fromthese facilities. More than half of these facilities are surface impoundments,which create concerns because of the mobility and physical driving forceof liquids in impoundments and the current limited use of design controls.Current data are insufficient, however, to determine the extent of potentialproblems. Study results indicate only sporadic use of design and operating controlsat industrial solid waste landfills and surface impoundments, with only12 percent and 22 percent, respectively, employing any type of liner system.Study findings also revealed that few of these facilities have monitoringsystems and only 35 percent were inspected by States in 1984, the latestyear for which data are available. Limited data on violations of State requirements, coupled with these statisticson design and operating controls, suggest that releases may be occurring,but more data are needed to determine the impacts of industrial SubtitleD facilities. The notification and exposure information requirements inPart 257 proposed today are a first step toward gathering this information.B. State Controls on Solid Waste ManagementThrough the State Census, EPA gathered information on State Subtitle Dprograms in areas such as organization and resources, regulations and permitprograms, and enforcement. In addition, EPA completed a detailed reviewof State regulations in 1984 (Ref. 25) and a supplemental review in 1987(Ref. 9). The following is a brief overview of State solid waste regulatoryprograms. MSWLFs are the Subtitle D facilities most closely regulated by the States.Most States and Territories impose some set of overall facility performancestandards; however, among the States and Territories, specific design andoperating standards vary greatly. For example, the 1987 regulatory reviewdetermined that 24 States and Territories require liners and 27 Statesand Territories require leachate collection systems. As of 1984, 28 Statesand Territories required gas control systems, and 38 specified some sortof run-on/run-off controls. Nearly all allow case-by-case exemptions andvariances. Many States and Territories impose some location standards or restrictionson MSWLFs. These usually include floodplain siting restrictions, whichrange from prohibitions on siting in the 100-year floodplain to specificdesign or performance standards for operations within the floodplain toa general directive to avoid sites subject to flooding. Although minimumdistances from surface and ground waters and from airports and utilitylines sometimes are specified, they too vary widely. For example, prescribeddistances from habitable residences vary from 200 feet to three-quartersof a mile and required distances from community water supplies range from400 feet to one mile. Thirty-eight States and Territories specifically require ground-water monitoringsystems, and an additional 12 States have general authority to impose ground-watermonitoring on a site-specific basis. With regard to corrective action,21 States have requirements in their regulations, while 22 others havegeneral authority to impose corrective action. Approximately half of theStates and Territories require methane gas monitoring and/or surface watermonitoring. While most States and Territories have general guidelines orrequirements for facility closure and post-closure maintenance requirements,these requirements vary widely in stringency. Finally, some form of financialassurance for closure and post-closure care is required in about half ofthe States and Territories. As can be seen from the above information, there are certain gaps in someState and Territorial regulatory programs, which may result in inadequateprotection of human health and the environment in some parts of the country.In some cases, the gaps in State and Territorial programs may be linkedboth to the inadequate implementation of the existing Federal Criteriaby certain States and Territories and to the absence of certain key regulatoryprovisions in the current Federal Subtitle D Criteria themselves. For example,the current Criteria do not require ground-water monitoring or monitoringfor methane releases, so MSWLF owners and operators may choose not to installmonitoring devices (if the State or Territory does not specifically requirethem) and thus may not detect problems before significant problems haveoccurred. The existing Criteria also do not require corrective measuresin the event contamination above levels of concern occurs. Furthermore,MSWLF owners and operators are not required to provide continued protectionof human health and the environment through effective closure proceduresand post-closure care. Agency experience since 1979 in both the hazardouswaste regulatory program and response actions under Superfund has confirmedthe importance of such preventive measures for long-term protection ofhuman health and the environment. C. Need for Revisions to the Part 257 CriteriaThe evidence briefly described above indicates that MSWLFs, when improperlydesigned and operated, may present threats to human health and the environment.The evidence further indicates that the Federal Criteria are missing severalkey regulatory provisions. These provisions include location restrictions,ground-water monitoring, and corrective action, which all are mandatedby HSWA. In addition, current data point to the need for the addition ofmethane monitoring, closure and post-closure care, and financial assurancerequirements. The Agency believes that the available data clearly indicatethat the current Federal Criteria have not proved adequate to protect humanhealth and the environment and must be revised to ensure such protection.These revisions to the Subtitle D Criteria come at a time when heightenedconcern is directed at issues of solid waste management. This concern derivesfrom State, Territorial, and local government difficulties in ensuringadequate capability for municipal solid waste management as well as publicconcern regarding potential hazards presented by waste disposal facilities.EPA is aware of the crisis in solid waste management and believes thatthese proposed Criteria revisions should be a major step toward alleviatingpublic concern with respect to inadequate controls on solid waste disposal.In addition, EPA believes these proposed revisions provide States and Territorieswith the flexibility needed to address the practicable capacity of theregulated community. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Public Participation in This Rulemaking</ITAG>Given the number and diversity of MSWLFs and the potentially significantimpacts that the revised Criteria may have on them, EPA involved the publicand private sector in the rulemaking process. This effort included publicmeetings and outreach activities aimed at encouraging participation inthe process.Since the spring of 1985, EPA has hosted or participated in a series ofpublic meetings, workshops, conferences, and other activities focusingon issues in the Subtitle D program. In August 1985, EPA sponsored a conferenceexplaining the major provisions of the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendmentsof 1984 that affected three key RCRA programs_Subtitle D, small quantitygenerators, and underground storage tanks. During the conference, EPA heldworkshops on the following Subtitle D issues: 1) Identification of availableinformation and case studies, 2) ground-water monitoring and protectionrequirements, 3) closure and post-closure care and financial responsibilityrequirements, 4) waste restrictions and liquids management requirements,and 5) liner and location requirements. The workshops provided a forumfor EPA and the participating State and local governments, public interestgroups, industry, and trade associations to exchange information and discusssignificant regulatory issues. On June 27, 1986, EPA hosted a public meeting in Washington, DC, on theissues and options being considered for the revisions to the Subtitle DCriteria. At that time, EPA presented the Agency's initial thinking onthe revised Criteria, solicited comments, and responded to questions fromrepresentatives of States, local governments, public interest groups, andprivate organizations. On November 18 to 20, 1986, EPA held a three-day conference in Arlington,Virginia, on solid waste disposal facilities and HHW collection programs.At this conference, EPA presented interim results of the Subtitle D Study,reported on the status of the Subtitle D Criteria revisions, and discussedissues associated with HHW collection programs. Conference participantsalso made presentations on State regulatory perspectives and public- andprivate-sector views. EPA also sponsored a series of policy discussion meetings in 1986 involvinghigh-level representatives of the principal interest groups affected bythe Subtitle D program, including State and local governments, citizenand environmental groups, and industry and trade associations. The broadobjectives of these meetings, which were coordinated for EPA by the ConservationFoundation, were to examine the effectiveness of the Subtitle D program,identify issues likely to affect implementation of the revised Criteria,and suggest innovative strategies to address problems identified.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Scope and Structure of Today's Proposal </ITAG>The revised Criteria EPA is proposing today vary considerably in scopeand content from the current Criteria in Part 257. This section explainsthe basis for EPA's decisions with respect to the scope and structure oftoday's proposal.A. Scope of the Existing Part 257 The existing Part 257 Criteria are applicable to all solid waste disposalfacilities and practices regulated under Subtitle D of RCRA. With certainexceptions listed in andSection; 257.1(c), the Criteria apply to all typesof facilities (i.e., landfills, surface impoundments, land applicationunits, and waste piles) used for disposal of solid waste, as well as alltypes of solid wastes (i.e., municipal, industrial, commercial, agricultural,mining, and oil and gas waste) regulated under Subtitle D of RCRA. Part 257 also applies to the disposal of sewage sludges from POTWs, butthe Agency currently is developing specific standards for managing POTWsewage sludge under section 405(d) of the CWA. These standards will establishpollutant concentration limits and management practices for sludge monofills,land application units, (including distribution and marketing), incineration,and ocean dumping. The Agency plans to propose these standards in 1989.At that time, EPA will propose amending Part 257 to exclude POTW sewagesludge from its requirements. As previously discussed, today's revisedCriteria proposal governs the co-disposal of sewage sludge with householdwastes.B. Scope of Today's Proposal HSWA directs EPA to develop revisions to the Part 257 Criteria for thesubset of solid waste disposal facilities that ``may receive hazardoushousehold wastes or hazardous wastes from small quantity generators.''Congress thus identified for EPA the scope of the revised Criteria. Basedon the studies performed to date, EPA has found that the HSWA-mandatedscope includes all MSWLFs, which may receive HHW and SQG hazardous waste,and some industrial solid waste disposal facilities and certain other SubtitleD facilities, which may receive SQG hazardous waste. However, as notedabove, EPA has obtained extensive information on only the characteristicsof MSWLFs and the risks they may pose to human health and the environment.Neither EPA nor the States have comparable information on industrial solidwaste disposal facilities at this time. For this reason, EPA has decidedto undertake the revisions to the Part 257 Criteria in phases. The first phase will apply to MSWLFs (landfills that receive householdwaste) and is the subject of today's proposal. A second phase will applyto industrial solid waste disposal facilities (disposal facilities thatreceive solid waste generated by manufacturing or industrial processes),including those that receive SQG hazardous waste, and will be proposedat such time as EPA has adequate data on which to base its decisions. Becauseof EPA's concern about industrial solid waste disposal facilities (includinglandfills, surface impoundments, waste piles, and land application units),however, EPA already has initiated data collection, described later inthis preamble, to determine the potential impacts of certain of these facilities.In addition, EPA today is taking the first regulatory step in addressingindustrial facilities by proposing to require notification and exposureinformation from owners and operators of certain of these facilities. TheAgency recognizes that additional regulatory efforts will be necessaryto regulate other disposal facilities not included in the first two phases.C. Structure of Today's Proposal Because today's proposal is substantially different in scope and contentfrom the Part 257 Criteria, EPA has chosen to create a new Part 258 forthe revised Criteria the Agency is proposing today. EPA considered simplyamending Part 257 to include the revised Criteria for MSWLFs, but decidedagainst that option because of the confusion that might be created by havingCriteria of general applicability alongside revised Criteria applicableonly to MSWLFs. Placing the revised Criteria in a separate Part 258 tracksthe distinction made by Congress, which indicated that the revisions onlyapply to facilities that may receive HHW or SQG hazardous waste. It alsoleaves the Part 257 Criteria in place for all other solid waste disposalfacilities besides MSWLFs.D. Scope and Effect of Today's Proposal on MSWLFs That Co-dispose of SludgeThe regulations proposed today would apply, under the authority of section405 (d) and (e) of the Clean Water Act, to all MSWLFs that co-dispose ofsludge. Section 405(d) requires EPA to promulgate regulations providingguidelines for the use and disposal of sludge. In general, these regulationsmust identify numerical limitations and management practices that are adequateto protect public health and the environment from reasonably anticipatedadverse effects; however, if, in EPA's judgment, it is not feasible toprescribe or enforce a numerical limitation for a pollutant, EPA may insteadpromulgate a design, equipment, management practice, or operational standard,or combination thereof, that in EPA's judgment is adequate to protect publichealth and the environment from reasonably anticipated adverse effects.Today's proposal reflects EPA's tentative determination that it is notfeasible to prescribe concentrations of pollutants in co-disposed sludgethat are protective of public health and the environment. Sludge typicallyis a minor portion of a co-disposal MSWLF (e.g., 5 percent). It is notfeasible to separately evaluate the fate, transport, and health and environmentaleffects of the sludge as distinguished from the remaining majority of wastesin the landfill. Nor does it make sense to try to regulate this small portionof a landfill's waste on a concentration basis, while regulating the entirelandfill on a comprehensive management basis. EPA has concluded that today'sproposal, which establishes a variety of management and operation requirements(including numerical limitations in the form of ground-water protectionstandards), will protect public health and the environment from reasonablyanticipated adverse effects.A significant effect of the promulgation of these regulations under section405(d) of the CWA would be the renewed eligibility of certain POTWs togrant removal credits to their industrial users under section 307(b) ofthe CWA. Section 307(b) requires EPA to promulgate pretreatment standardsfor industrial users of POTWs. Section 307(b) also allows an individualPOTW to relax these standards for its industrial users by giving them a``removal credit'' reflecting the POTW's removal capability, provided thatthe credit will not prevent the POTW from using or disposing of its sludgein accordance with section 405(d) of the CWA. EPA has promulgated removalcredit regulations in 40 CFR Part 403. On April 30, 1986, the United StatesCourt of Appeals for the Third Circuit invalidated the version of the removalcredits regulations promulgated in 1984. (<T3>Natural Resources Defense Council</T3> v. <T3>EPA</T3>, 790 F.2d 289 (3d Cir. 1986).) EPA has amended the regulationsto respond to all but one of the Third Circuit's four holdings (52 FR 42434,November 5, 1987). The Third Circuit's fourth holding was that EPA may not authorize POTWsto grant removal credits to their industrial users until EPA promulgatesthe sludge regulations required by section 405(d) of the CWA. EPA considersthe regulations proposed today to respond adequately to the Third Circuit'sdecision with respect to POTWs that dispose of all their sewage sludgethrough co-disposal in MSWLFs. These regulations would comprehensivelyregulate this sludge disposal practice; no further regulation of this practiceis required by law or contemplated by the Agency. Thus, upon promulgationof today's regulations, the POTWs that dispose of all their sludge in co-disposalMSWLFs may apply to EPA for removal credits authority, and EPA may grantsuch authority to any POTW that complies with the procedural and substantiverequirements of the removal credits regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. General Approach to Today's Proposal </ITAG>EPA's primary goals in developing today's proposal were to develop standardsthat are protective of human health and the environment, that are withinthe practicable capability of the regulated community, and that provideState flexibility in implementation. In order to meet these goals, EPAconsidered four options for the approach to today's proposal. First, EPAconsidered uniform design and operating standards for application to allMSWLFs. Second, EPA considered a performance standards approach that definesgoals for the design and operation of MSWLFs. The third and fourth optionsare methodology-based decision frameworks for determining design and operatingrequirements. In the third option, facility requirements are specifiedfor facilities in various location categories. The fourth option utilizesa risk assessment algorithm to delineate the necessary design and operatingcontrols. These options are not necessarily mutually exclusive; given thatthis proposal contains many facets, different options could be employedfor different parts of the rule (e.g., performance standards for locationrequirements and a methodological approach to design requirements). However,in general, EPA chose the performance standards approach for today's proposal.The uniform national design and operating standards option would imposespecific design standards and operating requirements on all units regardlessof location and other relevant factors. The Agency believes that such anapproach would not adequately account for variability across the country.For instance, this approach would require EPA to assume that all facilitylocations are ``poor'' and impose comprehensive design standards on allfacilities based on what is necessary to protect human health and the environmentin the ``poorest'' of locations. A rule that does not take into accountsite-specific location characteristics would likely over-regulate MSWLFsin ``good'' locations; however, a uniform standards approach may be easierto implement and enforce by States because of the specificity of the standard.The Agency also considered adopting the uniform national standards optionwith variances, in order to account for site-specific characteristics.Under this option, variances would be granted if the owner or operatorcould demonstrate that equivalent protection is provided by site-specificlocation, design, and operating characteristics. This approach parallelsthe one adopted for hazardous waste facilities under Subtitle C of RCRA,which imposes virtually identical requirements (e.g., double liners andleachate collection systems) at all new hazardous waste landfills. Variancesare then allowed, under Subtitle C, based on an adequate demonstrationby the owner or operator that the specific standard is not necessary. Whilevariances add some flexibility, EPA has two concerns about this approach.First, variance demonstrations often require substantial resources on thepart of the owner and operator and the States. Second, EPA is concernedthat public pressure would limit State or local flexibility in grantingvariances, even though they may be warranted for a specific site. Whilethis option might provide a high assurance of protection of human healthand the environment, it could over-regulate some facilities by requiringunnecessary controls. In addition, this approach does not fully take intoaccount the practicable capability of the regulated community. The second approach considered was to impose overall performance standardsfor each facility requirement. These performance goals or standards wouldrequire site-specific analyses to determine appropriate controls. EPA chosethis approach for this rulemaking because it allows the greatest flexibilityfor the State to consider numerous location-specific factors in tailoringfacility requirements. In addition, performance standards are less disruptiveof existing State programs and give facilities some needed latitude tomeet requirements within the bounds of their practicable capability. Finally,a performance standard, as opposed to a strict design standard, allowsfor the consideration of innovative technologies that may be developedin the future. The third approach, a methodological one, was to impose a decision frameworkbased on location categories to determine the applicable requirements fora specific facility. This approach would categorize all locations on thebasis of certain characteristics, then set individual requirements foreach category. Under this approach, appropriate requirements could be matchedto specific categories of locations. Methods of establishing location categoriesand their corresponding requirements would be specified in the revisedCriteria; then States, using information submitted by the owner or operator,could determine the category and apply the associated requirements to agiven facility. A key advantage to the categorical rule approach is thatit establishes uniform criteria for matching requirements to potentialproblems. For example, facilities in areas of the country characterizedby abundant rainfall could be required to collect generated leachate. Conversely,facilities in the more arid areas of the country do not necessarily generateleachate in quantities sufficient to warrant leachate control systems,and could be regulated accordingly. The Agency believes this categorical requirements approach would provideprotection without over-regulation; however, a complex, sophisticated schemewould be necessary to address every location consideration and to matchappropriate requirements. Furthermore, it would be difficult to developa technically defensible approach for all requirements for MSWLFs, particularlythose requirements that necessitate site-specific analyses (e.g., ground-watermonitoring). In addition, this approach would restrict State flexibilitybecause it would specify which designs are necessary for each location.The fourth option, also a methodological approach, is based on a risk assessmentalgorithm. This approach would require the use of a predictive equationto determine the necessary facility requirements. The predictive equationwould include some simplifying assumptions, but would utilize site-specificvalues for some of the parameters. Like the categorical approach, thisoption has the advantages of employing a uniform national standards approachthat could be easy to implement; however, it would be difficult to developa technically sound risk algorithm and could restrict State flexibility.EPA intends to provide guidance on how to design MSWLFs to meet the proposedperformance standards. The agency believes the categorical approach isone viable method for determining landfill design, and is considering developingthis method as guidance along with the risk algorithm method. Both of theseapproaches to design requirements are discussed in more detail in sectionIX.D of this preamble. The Agency requests comments on the approach proposedtoday and on the alternatives presented.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Major Issues</ITAG>A. Ground-Water Resource ValueResource value refers to the current and future importance of ground wateras a water supply and as an ecological resource. Highly saline ground wateror ground water with very low yield may have a low resource value. Pristineground water or ground water in high demand that cannot easily be replacedor restored similarly may have a high resource value. As EPA was developingthe framework for the revised Criteria, the Agency considered at lengththe subject of differential protection of ground water based on its resourcevalue. Specifically, EPA considered applying different engineering controls,monitoring, and corrective action requirements according to the resourcevalue of the ground water.In 1984 EPA issued the Ground-water Protection Strategy, which establishedthe concept of differential protection of ground water depending on itsresource value. Accordingly, three classes of ground water were identified.Class I ground waters are defined as special ground waters that are highlyvulnerable to contamination and that are either irreplaceable sources ofdrinking water or are ecologically vital. Class II ground waters are definedas current and potential sources of drinking water and those having otherbeneficial uses. Class III ground waters are defined as heavily salineground water or ground water otherwise contaminated beyond the level allowingcleanup through methods commonly used by public water supply treatments.The Agency expects to issue final Guidelines for Ground-Water Classificationduring 1988. States then may use this document for reference in makingground-water classification and resource evaluation decisions.With respect to facility design for MSWLFs, today's proposal would establishfacility design Criteria that give States the flexibility to address thevalue of ground-water resources in setting facility-specific design requirements.Section IX.D of today's preamble describes the Agency's approach for incorporatingresource value considerations into facility design decisions. EPA is notmandating use of the ground-water classification system set forth in EPA'sGround-water Protection Strategy. Rather, under this proposal, States wouldhave the discretion to assess the value of ground-water resources. In developingSubtitle D guidance in the future, however, the Agency may draw upon theGuidelines for Ground-Water Classification to provide examples of appropriateresource evaluation and classification decisions.The Agency also is proposing to allow consideration of resource value inthe corrective action and, to a lesser extent, the ground-water monitoringcomponents of today's rule. Specifically, today's proposal would allowthe ground-water protection standards to be adjusted by States in situationswhere MSWLFs are located over aquifers that meet certain conditions (seesection IX.E of today's preamble). These conditions include the following:(1) The aquifer is not a current or potential source of drinking water;and (2) the aquifer is not interconnected with waters to which the hazardousconstituents are migrating or are likely to migrate in a concentration(s)that represents a statistically significant increase over background concentrations.Adjustments made to the ground-water protection standard or cleanup standardwould be made on a site-specific basis by the State after determining thatthe above conditions are met. Furthermore, the time allowed for correctiveaction could vary based on the value placed on the ground water.In addition, EPA is proposing that any frequency of ground-water monitoring(above the minimum required) be specified by the State based on site-specificfactors, including the resource value of the ground water. The proposedapproach, however, would not allow exemptions from all ground-water monitoringfor facilities located over low value ground water. The Agency believesthat at least minimal ground-water monitoring is necessary at all MSWLFsto evaluate the performance of facility design and operation and to identifypotential threats to human health and the environment. Furthermore, HSWAspecifically mandates that the revised Criteria require ground-water monitoringas necessary to detect contamination at facilities that may receive HHWor SQG waste. The Agency requests comment on whether ground-water monitoringshould be waived for MSWLFs located over ground water of low resource value.Finally, EPA believes ground-water resource value already plays an importantrole in local and State decisions regarding the siting of MSWLFs. In thisproposal EPA has not established Federal siting Criteria specifically basedon resource value because EPA recognizes that resource value considerationsin facility siting are more appropriately made at the State and local levels.The Agency also recognizes that many States are implementing various ground-waterprotection strategies, including wellhead protection programs. EPA believestoday's proposal provides the States the flexibility to implement theseprograms and encourages them to increase certain requirements, as necessary,to meet the objectives of their wellhead protection programs. These requirementscould range from more stringent design controls for mimimizing migrationout of a unit to establishing certain location restrictions, such as minimumsetback distances from vulnerable municipal well fields.Comments are requested specifically on how the resource value of groundwater should be accounted for in setting the various requirements proposedtoday for MSWLFs.B. Exclusion of Closed MSWLFsEPA considered whether to apply the requirements proposed in Part 258 toMSWLF units that close prior to the effective date of the final rule. Closedunits are defined in andSection; 258.2 as those units that no longer receivewastes and have a final layer of cover material. EPA believes that inclusionof closed facilities in this rulemaking would raise numerous technical,legal, and implementation complexities that could not be resolved withinthe time frame of this rule. For example, inclusion of closed units couldovertax State implementation capabilities because identification of closedfacilities would be difficult and time consuming and complicated by issuessuch as changes in ownership. Thus, EPA proposes that closed units be excludedfrom regulation at this time. The Agency is in the process of examiningquestions regarding closed facilities, however, and will consider furtheraction once this effort has been completed.According to the State Census, a reported 32,000 closed solid waste disposalfacilities are located across the U.S., but EPA does not know how manyof these are closed MSWLFs. In the absence of closed MSWLF regulations,these facilities, which represent potential threats to human health andthe environment because of their number and because many were poorly designedand managed, may be addressed under EPA's Superfund program or by RCRAenforcement provisions for imminent hazards. Because the Agency is concerned about closed MSWLFs, EPA today encourageseach State to develop a long-term regulatory strategy to deal with theseclosed facilities. EPA believes that developing a closed MSWLF strategyshould include at least the following steps: 1) Review of the State's legalauthority to address closed facilities; 2) an inventory of closed facilitiesto identify the location of these facilities and to gather available informationon facility age and size, waste types disposed of, and known local ground-waterusage; 3) ranking of sites by the present danger to human health and theenvironment; 4) determination of the adequacy of the existing regulatorycontrols for closed sites and their ability to respond to any problems;and 5) use of the available legislative and regulatory authorities to addressproblems identified with closed sites. EPA specifically is interested incomments on Federal and State strategies that may be used in addressingthese closed MSWLFs. C. Practicable Capability The Congressional directive to revise the existing Criteria (andSection;4010of RCRA as amended) states that EPA may consider the ``practicable capability''of owners and operators of facilities that may receive HHW or SQG wastein determining what these revisions should entail. Congress recongnizedthat the universe of owners and operators of solid waste disposal facilitiesincluded many with limited economic and technical capabilities. For example,many MSWLFs are owned and operated by small local governments with limitedresources. Development of today's proposal, therefore, included an analysisof how the ``practicable capability'' of owners and operators should betaken into account when setting appropriate controls for protection ofhuman health and the environment. The Agency believes that practicable capability encompasses both technicaland economic components. The technical component includes both the availabilityof technology for addressing a particular problem (i.e., technical feasibility),as well as the technical capability of the owner or operator to implementthat technology. The economic component refers to the economic resourcesavailable to the owner or operator to implement the revised standards.To assist in characterizing the practicable capability of MSWLFs, EPA collecteddata on waste disposal, demographics, landfill size, and landfill ownership.These data indicate that most MSWLFs handle relatively small volumes ofmunicipal solid waste (measured in tons per day). EPA estimates that 52percent of all landfills manage less than 17.5 tons per day (TPD) and accountfor less than 2 percent of the waste handled by all MSWLFs. However, thelargest landfills (2.6 percent of all MSWLFs) handle more than 1,125 TPDand manage 40 percent of all municipal landfill waste. These data also clearly indicate that most MSWLFs are located in ruralareas and these MSWLFs typically serve a limited number of communitiesrelative to landfills located in more urban areas. EPA matched 1982 Censusdata with geographic location data (longitude and latitude coordinates)to determine whether landfills are located in low- (rural) or high- (urban)density counties. EPA estimates that 69 percent of existing landfills arein counties with population densities of fewer than 100 people per squaremile, supporting the conclusion that most landfills are located in ``rural''areas. In addition, EPA Facility Survey data (Ref. 36) show that, on average,only 1.8 communities share a landfill at the village or town level, butthat at the city level, there are 3.8 communities per landfill. To address the economic component of practicable capability, EPA assessedthe financial capability and current spending practices of municipal governments.EPA assembled financial and demographic data from the ``1982 Census ofGovernments'' and the ``1983 County and City Data Book.'' Based on the1982 Census data, EPA estimates that communities typically spend less than1 percent of their budgets on solid waste disposal. In comparison withother municipal services, costs at this level represent a very small obligation.For example, as an average percentage of total community expenditures,communities spend 36 percent on education, 5 percent on police protection,and 3 percent on sewage disposal. The 1982 Census data also were used todevelop a composite score of nine various financial and economic vitalitymeasures. This score categorizes communities' financial capabilities asweak, average, or strong. EPA used the score to assess the baseline financialcondition of governments and the economic impact of various regulatoryscenarios. The development and categorization of the composite score andthe economic impact analysis is described in detail in Section XI of thispreamble and in the draft regulatory impact analysis for today's proposal.EPA believes that significant disruptions of solid waste management couldresult unless these technical and economic factors are taken into accountwhere necessary. The Agency, therefore, examined the range of MSWLFs todetermine which, if any, might be especially susceptible to technical difficultiesor economic hardship. Owners and operators of two classes of MSWLFs wereidentified as possible candidates for consideration of practicable capability_existingMSWLF units and small MSWLFs. EPA estimates that there are more than 6,000 MSWLFs currently in operation.Of these existing facilities, about 20 percent are expected to close before1990 and almost 75 percent are expected to close within 15 years (Ref.10). EPA evaluated whether requirements should be the same for these facilitiesas for new MSWLF units. Regulating new and existing MSWLF units differently allows considerationof practicable capability of the existing MSWLF, although some problemsat existing facilities may not be addressed if these units face less stringentrequirements. Regulating new and existing units the same way, while conceptuallyoffering greater assurance of protection, could impose very high costs,creating implementation difficulties and posing the prospect of solid wastemanagement disruptions. Comments that EPA received prior to proposal fromStates, industry groups, and private firms favored different requirementsfor new and existing units.   Based on these considerations, EPA is proposing today to vary some requirementsfor new and existing landfill units. These differences fall in three majorareas. First, the majority of the location restrictions proposed todaywould be applicable only to new landfill units (that is, units that havenot received wastes prior to the effective date of the rule). EPA believesthe application of today's location restrictions to existing units wouldresult in significant disruption of solid waste management in certain areasof the country. However, existing units would be required to comply withthe unstable area restrictions (andSection; 258.15) because the Agency believesthese areas pose particular concerns for protection of human health andthe environment. Second, today's proposal does not require that existing units be retrofittedwith liners and leachate collection systems. EPA believes that such a requirementwould: (1) Exceed the economic capabilities of the majority of owners andoperators of existing facilities, (2) present additional public healthproblems from the excavation of waste, and (3) disrupt existing solid wastemanagement activities. Third, today's proposal provides a phase-in period of 18 months for allrequirements not only to allow States to put in place revised regulations,but also to provide lead time for owners and operators to comply with thenew requirements. Furthermore, additional phase-in time is provided forground-water monitoring due to the resources needed by States and ownersand operators to implement this provision. Detailed discussion of the ground-watermonitoring provision is provided in Section IX.E of this preamble. In today's proposal, EPA has not varied requirements for new and existingunits in cases where such requirements are equally feasible, technicallyand economically, at both new and existing landfill units, except existingfacilities would have more time to comply with certain requirements. Forexample, the operating criteria (Subpart C) and ground-water monitoringand corrective action requirements (Subpart E) are applicable equally tonew and existing units, although new facilities must comply with SubpartE's ground-water monitoring requirements before they can accept wastes,while existing units may have up to five years to comply. EPA also considered varying requirements for small MSWLFs. The Agency estimatesthat, of the approximately 6,000 active MSWLFs, just over half handle 17.5TPD or less (Ref. 10). In contemplating whether to regulate small MSWLFsdifferently from large ones, EPA determined that practicable capabilityconsiderations did not outweigh potential health and environmental threats.Specifically, the Agency believes that size represents only one factorin determining potential risk, and that other variables, such as designand operating controls, location and climate characteristics, and wastestreams, can be significant determinants of risk regardless of MSWLF size.Based on the risk assessment for this rulemaking, EPA concluded that nosingle factor factor is responsible for most of the variability in riskacross MSWLFs; rather, there is a complex interaction among the factorsthat govern leachate flux and flow through the underlying aquifer (Ref.10). As a result, EPA is not proposing any special exceptions for smallMSWLFs. However, the Agency believes that today's proposal provides Statesadequate flexibility to address particular site-specific conditions presentat MSWLFs, including small MSWLFs. In addition, the 18-month phase-in period,along with a State-specified ground-water monitoring compliance schedule,should provide owners and operators of small MSWLFs adequate time to complywith the requirements proposed today or to make other arrangements forsolid waste disposal. D. Extent of the Criteria Revisions HSWA directs that, at a minimum the Criteria revisions require ``groundwatermonitoring as necessary to detect contamination, establish criteria forthe acceptable location of new or existing facilities, and provide forcorrective action as appropriate.'' The statute further specifies thatthe revised Criteria shall be ``those necessary to protect human healthand the environment and may take into account the practicable capabilityof solid waste disposal facilities.'' Because of EPA's mandate to protecthuman health and the environment, the Agency was not confined to theseminimum statutory requirements (i.e., location restrictions, ground-watermonitoring, and corrective action requirements) in developing today's proposal.Limiting the Criteria revisions to the statutory minimum would omit importantpreventive measures (e.g., gas controls) necessary for long-term protectionof human health and the environment. Moreover, exceeding the mimimum reducesthe reliance on detection systems for protecting human health and the environmentand thus results in a higher level of protection. Furthermore, going beyond the statutory minimum allows the Agency to considerother requirements that can prevent failures and corrective actions, eventhough these additional requirements may add costs for preventive measuresat facilities that would not have failed and thus did not need the preventivemeasures; however, the Agency has taken into account the practicable capabilityof municipal solid waste landfills in specifying the required level ofenvironmental controls. During the development of these Criteria revisions, EPA received commentson whether or not the revised Criteria should exceed the statutory minimum.In general, industry advocated confining the scope of the rule to the statutoryminimum. Several industry associations, however, supported an expandedscope as long as flexibility was built into the rule and site-specificfactors could be considered in determining what controls should be imposed.State views were divided. Some preferred requiring the statutory minimumonly, while others suggested varying subsets of additional requirements,and still others wanted comprehensive controls. In today's action, EPA has proposed revisions that go beyond those minimallyrequired by HSWA (i.e., location restrictions, ground-water monitoring,and corrective action). In addition to the statutory minimum, today's proposalincludes an update of the design and operating criteria in the existingPart 257 Criteria, and adds new requirements for closure and post-closurecare and financial responsibility. The rationale for each of these newprovisions, which the Agency believes are necessary for the protectionof human health and the environment, is discussed in detail later in thispreamble. The Agency seeks comments on the extent of the revisions proposedtoday. E. Requirements for Facilities Other Than MSWLFs EPA is concerned about the estimated 28,000 industrial solid waste disposalfacilities and 2,600 construction/demolition waste landfills, as discussedpreviously. However, today's proposal would limit the applicability ofthe revised Criteria to MSWLFs because there are insufficient data currentlyavailable to develop requirements for these other facilities. For thisreason, the Agency considered the information-reporting requirements thatmight be appropriate for identifying and assessing the risks associatedwith industrial waste disposal facilities and construction/demolition wastelandfills, and for determining the need for additional controls on thesefacilities. EPA contemplated three information-reporting options for these facilities.The first option was a notification requirement. Notification could provideinformation on these solid waste disposal facilities, including data ontheir locations, ownership, and waste management practices. This informationcould be used to answer basic questions about these facilities withoutplacing significant resource demands on the owners and operators of theseaffected facilities or the States. This option, however, provides no specificdata on the potential environmental or human health impacts posed by thesefacilities.A notification requirement with an exposure information component was thesecond option. Facilities would be required to supply exposure information,such as distance to the property boundary and available data on the populationthat could readily be exposed. This information could help EPA and theStates roughly assess the potential risks currently posed by these facilitiesand use this information to select facilities that need more careful examinationand analysis. States should use this information especially to help setpriorities; however, information defining potential exposed populationmay be of limited utility if not backed by monitoring results indicatingthe extent of any releases that may be occurring.A ground-water monitoring requirement was the third option considered bythe Agency. Comprehensive ground-water monitoring data could provide astrong foundation on which to base analyses in support of rulemaking applicableto facilities other than MSWLFs. However, this effort would be resource-intensivefor States and much more costly to the regulated community then simpleroptions. Given the diversity and size of this universe of facilities, ground-watermonitoring may not be necessary for all facilities. While ground-watermonitoring could generate substantial data, EPA believes there are morecost-effective ways of establishing a data base for rulemaking. EPA believesthat the risks posed by these facilities should be evaluated more closelybefore taking the significant step of requiring ground-water monitoringat all 28,000 industrial solid waste disposal facilities and construction/demolitionwaste landfills nationwide. The advantage of a strong information baseis offset by the added costs and burden imposed on these facilities formonitoring and the resulting potential for exceeding the practicable capabilityof marginally profitable operations. Moreover, most States would have difficultyimplementing the program due to the extensive resources it would requireand the fact that even the basic data (e.g., location) on these facilitiesare very limited in many States.Instead, EPA is contemplating a phased approach to data collection. Theproposed amendment to Part 257, which is described in more detail in sectionVIII of this preamble, calls for a notification requirement with a limitedamount of exposure information. Once these basic data are compiled andanalyzed, the Agency can determine what further information requirementsor regulatory controls should be pursued for industrial solid waste disposalfacilities and construction/demolition waste landfills.<ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Amendments to Part 257</ITAG>Today's proposal includes amendments to 40 CFR Part 257. These amendmentsinclude: (1) Conforming changes to Part 257 that would make it consistentwith the proposed Part 258; (2) an update to the MCLs listed in AppendixI of Part 257; and (3) a notification requirement for certain types offacilities.A. andSection;andSection; 257.1-2 Conforming Changes to Part 257Today's proposal adds municipal solid waste landfills to the list of exceptionsto the Part 257 Criteria contained in andSection; 257.1(c). Because MSWLFswould be covered by the proposed Part 258 Criteria, they would no longerbe subject to the Part 257 Criteria that are generally applicable to solidwaste disposal facilities and practices. The Part 257 Criteria would otherwisebe unchanged with respect to their applicability, and would remain in fulleffect for all other facilities and practices.Today's proposal also would add certain facility definitions to Part 257.Included are definitions of the four types of solid waste disposal facilitiesthat would be regulated by the Part 257 Criteria: Landfills, surface impoundments,land application units, and waste piles. These new definitions would clarifythat these types of solid waste disposal facilities are subject to thePart 257 Criteria.B. andSection;andSection; 257.3-4 Revisions to Ground-Water RequirementsEPA is proposing to update the MCLs, which are used as ground-water protectioncriteria in Part 257, to include any MCLs that have been established byEPA since the promulgation of Part 257 in 1979. Currently, Part 257 imposesbasic environmental criteria for the protection of human health and theenvironment. At the time Part 257 was promulgated, the available interimMCLs for the protection of human drinking water were included as ground-waterprotection criteria. MCLs are developed by EPA under section 1412 of theSafe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), which was amended in 1986. Under the 1986Amendments to the SDWA, EPA is mandated to promulgate drinking water regulationsfor a large number of constituents; these regulations generally includeMCLs. Accordingly, this notice would revise the Part 257 regulations toinclude any new MCLs as ground-water protection criteria (including theMCLs for eight volatile organics that were promulgated on July 8, 1987;see 52 FR 25690). Because the development of MCLs is an ongoing process,EPA is proposing to simply reference the MCL regulations (40 CFR Part 141)directly, rather than update Appendix I, which now includes only the MCLspromulgated prior to 1979. Therefore, today's action proposes to eliminateAppendix I and to incorporate the MCLs by reference to 40 CFR Part 141.Using this approach, the Agency avoids the need to update the Part 257Criteria every time EPA issues a new MCL. The public would have the opportunityto comment on whether it would be appropriate to use each new MCL as aground-water protection standard under Part 257.C. andSection; 257.5 Notification and Exposure Information RequirementsThe proposed amendments to Part 257 also include a notification and exposureinformation requirement for certain solid waste disposal facilities (andSection;257.5). As discussed above, under this requirement, EPA intends to obtainnotification and exposure information from a set of solid waste disposalfacilities of particular concern: Industrial landfills, surface impoundments,land application units, and waste piles, as well as construction/demolitionwaste landfills.As explained earlier, these facilities are of concern to the Agency becausethey represent a large and diverse set of solid waste disposal facilities,and little information is available on these facilities at either the Stateor Federal level. In addition, some of these sites may be used for disposalof SQG hazardous waste and may pose unknown risks to human health and theenvironment. EPA plans to undertake data collection efforts on these facilitiesto establish the basis for future rulemaking. Today's proposed requirementfor notification and exposure information from these facilities is a firstmajor step toward revising the current regulatory program for these facilities.The information EPA is proposing to require from these facilities consistsof two parts: Basic notification information for facility identificationpurposes and limited exposure information to be used to estimate potentialrisks posed by these facilities. The notification information is necessarybecause neither EPA nor the State have adequate information on these facilitiesto support fully revised Criteria for these facilities at this time. EPA'srecent survey of the States clearly indicates the scarcity of data on industrialsolid waste disposal facilities and construction/demolition waste landfills.The proposed notification requirement would provide EPA and the Statesthe mechanism to identify the universe of facilities and, at the same time,indicate to the facilities that they are subject to Subtitle D.The notification also would request very basic data for determining thepotential risks the facilities present to human health and the environment.For example, in addition to seeking general facility information, the proposednotification includes two questions relating to the potential risks posedby the facility: The number of households within one mile of the facility,and the number of on-site monitoring wells. Information submitted in responseto these risk-based questions could be used by the States in setting prioritiesfor inspections and other activities. EPA requests comments on whetherto include other risk-related questions in the proposed notification, suchas questions concerning the use of local waters (ground and surface), thenumber of local drinking water wells, and the number of municipal waterintakes downstream from the facility. In addition, EPA requests commentsgenerally on the appropriate questions to be included on the notificationform, and whether the form should be sent to both EPA and the State.The proposed notification and exposure information requirement is onlyone part of EPA's data collection efforts with respect to industrial solidwaste disposal facilities. The Agency recently has completed a major telephonesurvey, and other efforts are under consideration, such as an in-depthmail survey, a closer examination of State regulatory programs, and collectionof available ground-water monitoring data. The Agency intends to developrevised Criteria for these facilities as soon as adequate data are availableto support rulemaking.<ITAG tagnum="84">IX. Section-by-Section Analysis of Part 258</ITAG>A. Subpart A_GeneralSubpart A discusses the purpose, scope, and applicability of the proposedPart 258. It provides definitions necessary for the proper interpretationand implementation of the rule and identifies what Federal laws are tobe considered in complying with these rules.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. andSection; 258.1 Purpose, Scope, and Applicability</ITAG>Part 258 sets forth minimum national criteria for the location, design,operation, cleanup, and closure of municipal solid waste landfills. AnMSWLF that does not meet these criteria would be considered an open dumpfor purposes of State solid waste management planning under RCRA. Opendumping is prohibited under section 4005 of RCRA.Part 258 would apply to all new and existing municipal solid waste landfills,as defined in andSection; 258.2, except MSWLF units that closed prior tothe effective date of the rule. As specified in andSection; 258.2, a closedunit is any solid waste disposal unit that no longer receives solid wasteand has received a final layer of cover material. As discussed in moredetail later, the Agency believes that final covers are essential for closureof MSWLF units. This definition would ensure that the owner or operatorcannot escape these regulations by simply refusing to accept additionalwaste and abandoning the MSWLF. Part 258 requirements do not apply to unitsthat are created within the area of contamination during Superfund actions.In addition, Part 258 would not apply to other landfills, or surface impoundments,waste piles, or land application units used for solid waste disposal; thesefacilities will continue to be covered under Part 257.Landfills that receive municipal waste combustion (MWC) ash regulated underSubtitle D of RCRA, including MWC ash monofills, would be considered municipalsolid waste landfills for the purposes of this rule (see section IX.A.2of today's preamble). Therefore, today's proposal applies to any SubtitleD landfill that receives MWC ash. However, legislation is currently pendingin Congress which, if enacted, would require specific standards for thedesign of MWC ash disposal facilities which differ from today's proposeddesign requirements. In addition, the Agency is concerned that certainrequirements proposed today may not be adequate or appropriate for MWCash disposal facilities. For example, today's proposed air criteria donot specifically require fugitive dust controls during MWC ash transportation.Also, certain ground-water monitoring parameters (e.g., volatile organicconstituents) and the methane gas controls proposed today for MSWLFs maynot be appropriate for MWC ash monofills due to the characteristics ofMWC ash. In addition, the proposed daily cover requirements may not benecessary at MWC ash monofills that utilize operating controls, such asthe periodic application of moisture to the landfill surface. The Agencyspecifically requests comments on the adequacy and appropriateness of today'sproposed requirements for MWC ash disposal.In a separate effort, the Agency is developing guidance on MWC ash disposal.This guidance will provide additional information regarding the properlocation, design, and operation of MWC ash disposal facilities.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Section 258.2 Definitions </ITAG><T3>Aquifer. </T3>EPA has defined aquifer for this proposal as a geologicformation, group of formations, or portion of a formation capable of yieldingsignificant quantities of ground water to wells or springs. This definitionis the same one currently used in EPA's hazardous waste program and differsfrom the original Criteria definition (40 CFR 257.3-4(c)(1)) only in thatit substitutes the term ``significant'' for ``usable.'' The Agency hasselected this definition for two reasons: First, because of several commentsreceived on the ambiguity of the word ``usable,'' especially with respectto resource value, and second, because the delineation of the aquifer isa site-specific determination. Some concern has been expressed, however,that this new definition also is vague and that the rule should define``significant.'' One possible approach would be to define ``significant''as a minimum sustained yield of a certain amount (e.g., one gallon perminute); however, EPA does not have sufficient information to determinethe amount of ground water that must be produced to be considered ``significant''in all cases and believes, therefore, that such a determination at thistime would be arbitrary. EPA believes such a determination should be site-specificand has structured the definition of aquifer accordingly. The Agency specificallyrequests comments on this approach to defining ``aquifer.'' <T3>Household Waste. </T3>Any solid waste, including garbage, trash, andsanitary waste in septic tanks, derived from households is defined as ahousehold waste. Household include single and multiple residences, hotelsand motels, bunkhouses, ranger stations, crew quarters, campgounds, picnicgrounds, and day-use recreation areas. This definition is consistent withthe RCRA Subtitle C regulations found at 40 CFR 261.4. <T3>Lateral Expansion. </T3>The Agency has defined this term to mean anyhorizontal expansion of the waste boundary of an existing landfill unit.Under this proposal, lateral expansions are treated as new units and mustmeet the requirements applicable to new units. Under this proposed definition,any area of any existing unit that has not received waste by the effectivedate of this rule and later receives waste, is a lateral expansion. <T3>Liquid Waste. </T3>Liquid waste, either bulk or containerized, is definedunder proposed andSection; 258.28(c)(2) as any waste that is determined tocontain free liquids according to Method 9095 (Paint Filter Liquids Test)(Ref. 42). This method has been adopted by the Subtitle C program in 40CFR Parts 264 and 265. Because the solids content of sewage sludge is readilydetermined, the Agency considered using a different definition of liquidsfor sewage sludge from publicly owned treatment works. Under that alternative,sludges that have a solids content of 20 percent or greater would not beconsidered liquid. That alternative was considered inferior to the PaintFilter Liquids Test for two reasons. First, the variability of sludgesmay result in certain sludges meeting the 20-percent criterion and stillbeing in a liquid state or containing free liquids. Second, the Agencybelieves that the Paint Filter Liquids Test is adequate to ensure that``dry'' sludges will not be eliminated from disposasl at MSWLFs. However,the Agency recognizes that using a solids content measure would allow easierimplementation because it is a measure commonly used by POTWs. EPA currentlyis conducting research to determine if a solids content measure would bean acceptable substitute for the Paint Filter Liquids Test for municipalsewage sludges. EPA specifically requests any data that will assist inevaluating the use of a solids content measure for purposes of this rule.<T3>Municipal Solid Waste Landfill. </T3>A municipal solid waste landfillis defined as any new or existing landfill or landfill unit that receiveshousehold waste. These may be publicly or privately owned. Landfills ownedby municipalities that do not accept household waste are not MSWLFs. MSWLFsalso may accept other types of Subtitle D wastes, such as commerical waste,nonhazardous POTW sewage sludge, construction/demolition waste, and industrialsolid waste. (Units that accept only these wastes will be addressed infuture rulemaking activities.) For example, a unit that receives primarilyconstruction/demolition waste, but also receives some household waste,is an MSWLF under this rule. This definition does not include landfillsregulated as hazardous waste units under Subtitle C of RCRA and is notmeant to capture industrial solid wate landfills that may receive office,sanitary, or cafeteria wastes generated at the site. Finally, the definitionof MSWLFs includes any landfill that receives MWC ash including ash monofills(i.e., landfills that receive only ash from MWC facilities) to the extentthat MWC ash is generated from the combustion of household waste aloneor in combination with other nonhazardous wastes.  <ITAG tagnum="81">3. andSection; 253.3 Consideration of Other Federal Laws </ITAG>Section 258.3 provides that the owner or operator of an MSWLF unit mustcomply with any other applicable Federal laws, regulations or requirements.There are numerous other Federal laws that must be considered in siting,designing, and operating MSWLFs. The owner or operator is responsible forensuring that the requirements of all applicable statutes and regulations,as well as any other requirements, are met. Applicable statutes include,but are not limited to, the following: andbullet; National Historical Preservation Act of 1966, as amended. andbullet; Endangered Species Act. andbullet; Coastal Zone Management Act. andbullet; Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. andbullet; Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act. andbullet; Clean Water Act.andbullet; Clean Air Act.andbullet; Toxic Substances Control Act.B. Subpart B_Location RestrictionsEPA has identified six types of locations that require special restrictions:sites in the vicinity of airports, 100-year floodplains, wetlands, faultareas, seismic impact zones, and unstable areas. Restrictions for sitesnear airports and floodplains are included in the original Part 257 Criteria.EPA is proposing to add to the revised Criteria restrictions on sitingin wetlands, fault areas, unstable areas, and seismic impact zones because,as discussed below, EPA believes that the additional information that hasbeen developed and reviewed since promulgation of the current Part 257Criteria supports the need for additional controls in these locations.References to ``new MSWLFs'' in this section and throughout this preamblerefer to new units, as well as to lateral expansions of existing units.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Section 258.10 Airport Safety</ITAG>Under today's proposal, new and existing MSWLFs located within the distancelimits specified in Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Order 5200.5(10,000 feet for airports handling turbojets and 5,000 feet for airportshandling piston-type aircraft) may not pose a bird hazard to aircraft.The proposed requirement is identical to the current andSection; 257.3-8and is included because MSWLFs receive putrescible wastes that can attractbirds despite controls such as daily cover. When solid wastes are disposedof near airports, the birds attracted to the area can present a significantrisk of collisions with aircraft. The FAA Order 5200.05, ``FAA GuidanceConcerning Sanitary Landfills on or Near Airports'' (October 16, 1974)states that solid waste disposal facilities have been found by study andobservation to be attractive to birds and, therefore, ``may be incompatiblewith safe flight operations'' when located near an airport. The backgrounddocument relevant to this section (Ref. 2) discusses instances of damageresulting from bird strikes that have occurred near landfills.The distances derived from Order 5200.5 are based on the fact that over62 percent of all bird strikes occur below altitudes of 500 feet (150 meters)and that aircraft generally are below this altitude within the distancesspecified.EPA wishes to make it clear that the ``bird hazard'' of concern is ``anincrease in the likelihood of bird/aircraft collisions.'' Thus, EPA expectsthat solid waste disposal within the specified distances would occur onlyif the operation can be managed in such a way as to not increase the riskof collision within the specified distances. EPA recommends that ownersand operators of MSWLFs consult with the Fish and Wildlife Service to determinewhether specific facilities pose a bird hazard to aircraft. Where appropriate,this determination should be made in consultation with FAA, as well aswith the owners and operators of the airports of concern.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Section 258.11 Floodplains</ITAG>EPA proposes to include a floodplain requirement in Part 258 that is identicalto the requirement in the current Part 257 Criteria. Thus, EPA is proposingthat new and existing MSWLFs located in the 100-year floodplain shall notrestrict the flow of the 100-year flood, reduce the temporary water storagecapacity of the floodplain, or result in the washout of solid waste soas to pose a hazard to human health and the environment. The Agency's thinkingtoday is consistent with the rationale for the original Criteria, as discussedin 44 FR 53438, dated September 13, 1979. Namely, disposal of solid wastein floodplains may have significant adverse impacts: (1) If not adequatelyprotected from washout, wastes may be carried by flood waters and flowfrom the site, affecting downstream water quality; (2) filling in the floodplainsmay restrict the flow of flood waters, causing greater flooding upstream;and (3) filling in the floodplain my reduce the size and effectivenessof the temporary water storage capacity of the floodplain, which may causea more rapid movement of flood waters downstream, resulting in higher floodlevels and greater flood damages downstream. For these reasons, EPA believesthat it is desirable to locate disposal facilities outside floodplains.EPA estimates that 14 percent of all existing MSWLFs are located in 100-yearfloodplains. The Agency made this estimate by mapping MSWLFs nationwideand determining how many MSWLFs fell in areas mapped as floodplains. Casestudies, discussed in the background document for this section (Ref. 2),indicate that landfills are subject to design and operational failuresas a result of flooding.Today's proposal would require that new and existing MSWLFs, if locatedin a 100-year floodplain, be designed and operated to prevent the adverseeffects described above. EPA recognizes that locating MSWLFs in floodplainscan be expected to have some impact on the flow of the 100-year flood andwater storage capacity, regardless of precautions taken. The intent oftoday's proposed requirement is to require that MSWLFs not cause significantimpacts on the 100-year flood flow and water storage capacity. Site-specificinformation should be used to evalute whether a facility has met this standard.Consistent with the original Criteria, Part 258 as proposed today woulddefine the floodplain using the 100-year flood level. This criterion wouldlimit the chance for site inundation and increased flood levels and damages.The intent of this criterion is the same for Part 258 as it was for theoriginal Criteria: (1) To require an assessment of any new or existingdisposal site or expansion of any existing site in a floodplain to determinethe potential impact of the disposal site on downstream and upstream watersand land; (2) to prohibit such disposal activities if the site, as designed,may cause increased flooding during the 100-year flood; and (3) if thedisposal site is located in a floodplain, to require the use of availabletechnologies and methods to protect against inundation by the base floodand minimize potential for adverse effects on water quality and on theflood-flow capacity of the floodplain.This approach conforms with the intent of Executive Order 11988, datedMay 24, 1977, concerning floodplain management. Federal agencies are requiredto comply with this Executive Order, and State agencies are encouragedto develop and apply similar policies and to consider the provisions ofthe Unified National Program for Floodplain Management of the Water ResourcesCouncil in formulating and applying State policies.In order to determine whether a unit is located in the 100-year floodplain,owners and operators should use flood insurance rate maps (FIRMs) developedby the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) under the Federal InsuranceAdministration (FIA) pursuant to the National Flood Insurance Act of 1986.FEMA has developed FIRMs for approximately 99 percent of the flood-pronecommunities in the United States. FIRMs can be obtained at no cost fromthe FEMA Flood Map Distribution Center, 6930 (A-F) San Tomas Road, Baltimore,Maryland, 21227-6227. In areas of the country where FIRMs are not available,there are numerous other sources of floodplains maps, which include: TheU.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Soil Conservation Service, the NationalOceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the U.S. Geologic Survey, the Bureauof Land Management, the Bureau of Reclamation, the Tennessee Valley Authority,and State and local flood control agencies or other departments. When floodplainsmaps cannot be obtained from any of these sources, the owner or operator,with the assistance of a qualified professional firm, can determine flood-flowfrequency using Water Resources Council Bulletin Number 17A (1977), Guidelinesfor Determining Flood-Flow Frequency.EPA is requesting information on the problems associated with locatingfacilities in areas subject to frequent flooding (e.g., in five- or ten-yearfloodplains). The Agency is concerned about locating facilities in suchareas because EPA believes that frequent flooding may result in erosion,undermining, and eventual washout of the facility. Engineered systems forpreventing such occurrences, therefore, would be subject to frequent maintenance.EPA's existing Subtitle C regulations allow facilities in a 100-year floodplainif precautions to prevent washout have been taken similar to today's proposal.However, the Agency currently is considering revisions to its SubtitleC requirements for locating hazardous waste facilities in floodplains.A ban on MSWLFs in areas subject to frequent flooding could affect largeportions of the nation, including the majority of some States, and, thus,could strain the regulated community's ability to provide adequate disposalcapacity for municipal solid waste in those areas. Therefore, a total banon siting in floodplains for Subtitle D is not deemed appropriate. TheAgency is requesting comment on locating facilities in areas of frequentflooding. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Section 258.12 Wetlands </ITAG>Today's proposal includes provisions that no new MSWLF units can be placedin wetlands unless the owner or operator makes specific demonstrationsto the State that the new unit: (1) Will not result in ``significant degradation''of the wetlands as defined in the CWA section 404(b)(1) guidelines, publishedat 40 CFR Part 230, and (2) will meet other requirements derived from thesection 404(b)(1) guidelines. Existing facilities that are located in wetlandscould continue to operate. EPA believes that these stringent restrictions are necessary to protecthuman health and the environment because of the potential damage causedby siting MSWLFs in wetlands. The background document to the rule describesthe threats posed when MSWLFs are located in wetlands (Ref. 2). Moreover,within recent years the Agency has identified wetlands protection as atop priority, specifying aggressive implementation of the Clean Water Actsection 404 program, increased coordination with and consistency of Federaland State policies, and other measures as may be necessary. To this end,the Agency considers today's proposed action as essential measure for protectingwetland resources. Today's proposed action is based on existing Agency wetland policy as expressedin the 40 CFR Part 230 guidelines; Executive Order No. 11990, Protectionof Wetlands; and the January 23, 1986, Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) betweenEPA and the Army Corps of Engineers, which addresses the disposal of solidwaste in wetlands under RCRA. The 1986 MOA represents an interim arrangementfor controlling solid waste disposal in waters of the U.S., including wetlands.In the long term, the expanded RCRA solid waste regulations proposed hereinwill help play a key role in protecting wetlands from the unregulated disposalof waste materials. EPA's Part 230 guidelines are the regulations that specify the analyticaltools and environmental criteria to be used when determining whether toissue Clean Water Act section 404 permits for proposed discharges of dredgedor fill material in waters of the United States, which include most wetlands.To be consistent with the Act, the provisions proposed today in andSection;258.12 adopt the definition of wetlands contained in the Army Corps ofEngineers (the Corps) section 404 implementing regulations (33 CFR Parts320 through 330) and the EPA section 404(b)(1) guidelines (40 CFR Part230). EPA believes that consistency with this definition will aid in implementingthe MSWLF provisions. As defined by EPA and the Corps, wetlands are those``areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at afrequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstancesdo support, a prevalance of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturatedsoil conditions. Wetlands include, but are not limited to, swamps, marshes,bogs, and similar areas.'' Today's proposed action adopts the four major requirements of the guidelines:(1) The practicable alternatives test, (2) lack of significant degradation;(3) compliance with other applicable laws, and (4) minimization of adverseeffects. The guiding precept of the guidelines is that discharges intowetlands should not be allowed unless the owner or operator can demonstratethat such discharges: (1) Are unavoidable, i.e., there are no practicablealternatives to discharging in wetlands; and (2) will not cause or contributeto significant degradation of wetlands. In particular, the guidelines identifyfilling operations in wetlands as among the most severe environmental impactscovered. For this reason, EPA believes that these guidelines should beused to provide the basis for today's proposal. Moreover, these guidelinesare in keeping with Agency policy of maintaining consistency among differentEPA programs. The guidelines in andSection; 230.10(a) state that ``no discharge of dredgedor fill material shall be permitted if there is a practicable alternativeto the proposed discharge would less adversely impact on the aquatic ecosystem,so long as the alternative does not have other significant adverse environmentalconsequences.'' An alternative is practicable if it is: (1) Available and(2) feasible, i.e., capable of satisfying the basic or overall purposeof the proposed project, taking cost, logistics, and technology into consideration.For activities that are not water-dependent, i.e., do not require accessor proximity to wetlands to fulfill their basic purpose, the guidelinesfurther provide that: (1) Practicable alternatives that do not involvewetlands are presumed to be available, unless clearly demonstrated otherwise;and (2) where a discharge is proposed for a wetland, all practicable alternativesthat do not involve a discharge to a wetland are presumed to have a lessadverse impact on the aquatic ecosystem, unless clearly demonstrated otherwise.Both of these rebuttable presumptions place a burden on the permit applicantto demonstrate that no practicable alternatives exist. In addition to the practicable alternatives test, the guidelines also requirethat ``no discharge of dredged or fill material shall be permitted whichwould cause or contribute to significant degradation of the waters of theUnited States,'' including wetlands (40 CFR 230.10(c)). Under the guidelines,effects contributing to significant degradation considered individuallyor cumulatively include significant adverse effect on: (1) Human healthor welfare; (2) life stages of aquatic life and other wetland-dependentwildlife; (3) aquatic ecosystem diversity, productivity, and stability,e.g., a wetland's capacity to assimilate nutrients, purify water, or reducewave energy, and (4) recreational, aesthetic, and economic values. Third, andSection; 230.109(c) of the guidelines states that a discharge ofdredged or fill material shall not be permitted if it: (1) Causes or contributesto violations of any State water quality standards; (2) violates applicabletoxic effluent standards or other Clean Water Act Section 307 standards;(3) jeopardizes species or habitat protected under the Endangered SpeciesAct; or (4) violates any requirement imposed by the Secretary of Commerceto protect marine sanctuaries under the Marine Protection, Research, andSanctuaries Act.Moreover, the guidelines provide that a permit should not be issued unlessappropriate and practicable steps have been taken to minimize potentialadverse impacts of the discharge into wetlands (40 CFR 230.10(d)). SubpartH of the guidelines lists examples of the many types of actions that canbe undertaken to minimize the adverse effects of discharges of dredgedor fill material.Because construction of a new landfill essentially is a filling operation,it destroys the wetland, which generally cannot be restored due to thecomplexities and fragility of the ecosystem. EPA also believes that itis essential to preserve the ecological function of the remaining wetlandat an existing facility. Thus, unless the owner or operator can make thedemonstration specified in andSection; 258.12(a), new facilities and lateralexpansions of existing facilities into wetlands are banned. This demonstrationis similar to those established by EPA in the section 404(b)(1) guidelinesat 40 CFR 230.10. The importance of these demonstrations is discussed below.With regard to an owner or operator who wishes to site a new facility orexpand an existing facility in wetlands, today's proposal essentially adoptsthe restrictions on discharges contained in andSection; 230.10 of the guidelinesand requires them in the form of prior demonstrations to be made to theState. Failure to make any of the following demonstrations will bar theMSWLF from being sited in a wetlands.First, the MSWLF owner or operator must consider and evaluate alternativesites outside of wetlands and demonstrate that no environmentally acceptable``practicable alternative'' is available. As discussed above, andSection;230.10(a) of the guidelines provides guidance on the meaning of the term``practicable alternatives.'' Since a landfill is not a water-dependentactivity, the guidelines presume that: (1) Alternatives that do not involvelocating MSWLFs in wetlands are available, and (2) such alternatives havea less adverse impact on the aquatic ecosystem. These presumptions makethe alternatives analysis a rigorous test for the MSWLF owner or operatorto meet.Second, the MSWLF owner or operator must demonstrate that siting the landfillin the wetland will not cause or contribute to ``significant degradation''of the wetlands, as defined in 40 CFR 230.10(b). Third, the owner or operatormust ensure that siting in the wetlands does not violate any provisionsof the applicable laws specified in andSection; 230.10(c).Fourth, the MSWLF owner or operator must demonstrate that, if the MSWLFis sited in the wetland after satisfying 40 CFR 230.10 (a), (b), and (c),appropriate and practicable steps have been taken to minimize potentialadverse impacts of the MSWLF on the wetlands. These may include carefuldecisions with respect to the solid waste to be disposed of, any protectivetechnology employed, attention to plant and animal populations, and measuresthat mitigate unavoidable impacts on wetland values. The guidelines identifya number of possible measures.Finally, the owner or operator must show that sufficient information isavailable for making reasonable determinations with respect to these demonstrations;otherwise, the owner or operator cannot make the demonstrations necessaryto qualify for the waiver to the ban. This last requirement places theburden for making the required demonstrations squarely on the MSWLF owneror operator.EPA recognizes the burden that these requirements place on the MSWLF owneror operator who wishes to site a new facility, or expand an existing one,in wetlands. EPA believes, however, that the nation's wetlands are sensitiveecosystems that merit the protection afforded by these requirements. Forthis reason, the Agency proposes that no new MSWLFs (including internalexpansions of existing MSWLFs) should be located in wetlands unless theMSWLFs meet the stringent waiver requirements. Comments are requested onthe proposed ban and on the demonstration Criteria for the waiver.Since the EPA section 404(b)(1) guidelines are prospective in nature, theydo not address, or apply to, the question of existing facilities locatedin wetlands. The issue is whether, and to what extent, the revised Criteriashould prohibit or otherwise restrict the operation of existing MSWLFs.EPA recognizes that requiring existing MSWLFs in wetlands to close wouldnot generally restore the ecological function of the wetland. Further,requiring existing units in wetlands to close would adversely imapct wastedisposal capacity. EPA estimates that approximately 6 percent of all MSWLFsare in wetlands. This estimate was developed by correlating maps of wetlandareas with MSWLF locations. The Agency welcomes additional data that commentersmay wish to supply concerning the number of MSWLFs sited in wetlands.In developing the wetlands requirements for this proposal, EPA sought tobalance the need to protect the fragile ecosystem with the practicablecapability of owners and operators of MSWLFs. EPA recognizes that in someparts of the country, large areas fall within the definition of wetland.In these areas, a ban on the maintenance of existing facilities in wetlandscould have great detrimental effects on waste management in communitiesand could possibly encourage inadequate alternatives to be implemented.For existing facilities, EPA is not proposing to require closure and/orremoval of waste. The existing Subtitle C standards do not specificallyaddress wetlands, but the Agency intends to propose revisions to thesestandards in the future. The Agency believes that closure and/or removalof waste is not viable for MSWLFs located in or adjacent to wetlands becausethis approach would result in significant impacts on disposal capacityand cause major disruptions in current municipal solid waste management.There would be reduced capacity if MSWLFs located in wetlands were requiredto close and siting of MSWLFs in those States where large areas are includedunder the definition of wetlands would be substantially hindered. The Agencybelieves the approach proposed today for existing MSWLFs in wetlands properlyconsiders disposal capacity concerns and the practicable capability ofMSWLF owners and operators.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Section 258.13 Fault Areas</ITAG>EPA proposes to ban the siting of new units of MSWLFs in locations within60 meters (200 feet) of faults that have had displacement in Holocene time.(The Holocene is a geologic time unit, known as an epoch, that extendsfrom the end of the Pleistocene to the present and includes approximatelythe last 11,000 years.) This requirement would be consistent with the existinglocation standard for hazardous waste facilities under Subtitle C; EPAhas concluded that it is appropriate to impose the same requirement onMSWLFs because EPA believes that faults also may adversely affect the structuralintegrity of MSWLFs.Earthquakes present a threat to public safety and welfare in a significantportion of the United States. Damage and loss of life in earthquakes occuras a result of surface displacement along faults (surface faulting) andground motion (shaking), as well as secondary effects of the shaking suchas ground or soil failure. Today's proposed standard is designed to protectfacilities from deformation (i.e., bending and warping of the earth's surface)and displacement (i.e., the relative movement of any two sides of a faultmeasured in any direction) of the earth's surface that occur when the faultmoves. The best protection for MSWLFs is to avoid faults subject to displacementand the zone of deformation.The Agency is not proposing a standard for existing MSWLFs located overfaults. EPA considered requiring existing units located over faults toclose over a period of time; however, insufficient information exists thatwould justify the closure of these units. EPA requests comment on thisissue.The effects of deformation drop off rapidly as distance from the faultincreases. Since the greatest degree of deformation occurs along the faultwith the greatest displacement (usually the main fault), the farther awaythe MSWLF is from the main fault, the less likely it will be affected bydeformation. Studies of main fault traces (i.e., faults that had most displacementin an area) suggest that most deformation occurs within 60 to 90 metersof faults that have had displacement in Holocene time. Since the 60-metersetback is measured from any fault, not just the main fault trace, EPAbelieves that a 60-meter distance from any Holocene fault (surface or subsurface)would provide ample protection against the effects of deformation. If afacility is located near a fault, containment structures (liners, leachatecollection systems, and final covers) may be inadequate to prevent releaseof solid waste and hazardous constituents during an earthquake. Outsideof this zone, ground motion will be less severe, and containment structuresdesigned to withstand ground motion, as specified in andSection; 258.14 (describedbelow), should be adequate to protect human health and the environment.Holocene faults are faults that either were created or experienced displacementin Holocene time. The faults are a concern because the geologic evidenceindicates that faults that have been moved in recent times, i.e., duringHolocene time, are the ones most likely to move in the future. Faults thathave had displacement in Holocene time are easier to identify and datein the field than older faults because this epoch produced recognizablegeological deposits, and erosion and deposition surfaces. These faultsare identifiable by fault scarps, offset streams, mole tracks, furrows,and fault traces on young surfaces with ground-water barriers marked byspring alignments and vegetation contrasts.EPA's definition of ``fault'' is intended to include main, branch, or secondaryfaults. This definition would include both faults that appear at the surfaceand those that do not have surface expression (including the small faultplanes associated with surface faults). Because only faults that have experienceddisplacement in Holocene time are of concern in this standard, a subsurfaceor surface fault that has not disturbed the Holocene deposits is not includedin the definition.In some areas of the country, Holocene deposits and landforms are scarce,such as areas where glacial activity has stripped the surficial groundcover and left highly resistant rock, so inspection of Holocene depositsand landforms will not yield enough evidence to conclusively determinewhether there has been recent faulting activity. In these situations, referenceto seismic epicenter plots and historic records may be needed, and identificationand close examination of possible fault-related features expressed in Pleistoceneand older deposits may be necessary as well.In 1978, the U.S. Geological Survey mapped the location of Holocene faultsin the United States (Ref. 2). Maps of identified Holocene faults in theUnited States also are available from the States of California and Nevada.Based on these maps and maps of MSWLFs, EPA estimates that 35 percent ofall MSWLFs are in counties that contain faults that have been active inthe Holocene, putting a large number of MSWLFs in potentially threatenedareas. However, the Agency does not have data showing how close landfillslocated in these counties are to the active faults.The current Subtitle C regulations for hazardous waste facilities havethe same location restriction being proposed in today's rulemaking. TheAgency believes that this standard also is appropriate for MSWLFs becausefaults also present concerns relating to failure of containment structuresfor MSWLFs. In addition, the Agency believes that a similar ban is withinthe practicable capability of new MSWLFs because the area of the nationwithin 60 meters from a Holocene fault, i.e., the banned area, is limited.EPA requests comment on both the general concept of a location restrictionbased on fault areas and the specific 60-meter setback requirement.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Section 258.14 Seismic Impact Zones</ITAG>Today's proposal would require the owner or operator of a new MSWLF unitin a seismic impact zone to design the unit to resist the maximum horizontalacceleration in hard rock at the site. Seismic impact zones are definedas areas having a 10 percent or greater probability that the maximum expectedhorizontal acceleration in hard rock, expressed as a percentage of theearth's gravitational pull (g), will exceed 0.10g in 250 years. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and others have documentedstructural damages resulting from earthquakes. The potential for damageto MSWLFs from earthquakes can be deduced from similar structures damagedby earthquakes. Such damage includes cracks in foundations and completecollapse of structures. EPA believes that the adverse impact of sitingMSWLFs in seismic areas justifies the need for a comprehensive standardto prevent releases from these facilities. Types of failure that may resultfrom ground motion are: (1) Failure of structures from ground shaking;(2) failure of unit components due to soil liquefaction, liquefaction-inducedsettlement and landsliding, and soil slope failure in foundations and embankments;and (3) landsliding and collapse of surrounding structures. The backgrounddocument supporting this section of the rule (Ref. 2) provides examplesof the potential adverse effects on MSWLFs that may occur in seismic impactzones. The Agency believes that these failures may result in contaminationof air, ground water, surface water, and soil. Therefore, in order to protecthuman health and the environment, all containment structures, includingany liners, leachate collection systems, and surface water control systemsat new MSWLFs, must be designed to withstand the stresses created by peakground acceleration at the site from the maximum earthquake based on regionalstudies and site-specific analyses.The Agency's proposed requirement translates to a 4-percent probabilityof exceeding the maximum horizontal acceleration in 100 years. The Agencybelieves that the areas affected by the proposed ``seismic impact zone''requirement represent the areas of the United States with the greatestseismic risk, and, therefore, this proposal would be protective of humanhealth and the environment.The proposed performance requirement would minimize the risk of slope andliner failure due to seismic activity. By minimizing the risk of failureof the landfill slopes, the potential for exposure of solid waste to theatmosphere and the possible contamination of run-off by contacting exposedsolid waste also would be reduced. The Agency further believes that today'sproposal would reduce the potential for contamination of ground water beneaththe landfill resulting from failure of a liner.Although andSection;258.13 of today's proposal would prohibit siting newunits on or adjacent to active Holocene faults (faults that have had displacementin Holocene time) to protect against releases of wastes from facility failuredue to fault rupture, this standard does not address damage that may occuras a result of earthquake-induced ground motion. Studies indicate thatground motion is more important as a failure mechanism than fault rupture,and not all earthquakes are manifested by surface faulting (Ref. 2). Groundmotion resulting from earthquakes without associated surface faulting hasbeen found in some cases to be two or three times that associated withquakes with faulting.Maps depicting the potential seismic activity across the United Statesat a constant-probability level have been prepared (U.S. Geological SurveyOpen-File Report 82-1033). The maps indicate that certain portions of thecountry are at a higher level of seismic hazard than other areas. For example,portions of the eastern U.S., although not subject to frequent earthquakes,are at a higher level of seismic hazard than portions of the western U.S.The process of designing earthquake-resistant components may be dividedinto three steps: (1) Determining expected peak ground acceleration atthe site from the maximum quake, based on regional studies and site-specificseismic risk analysis; (2) determining site-specific seismic hazards (e.g.,soil liquefaction); and (3) designing the facility to withstand peak groundaccelerations. Various methods for accomplishing the above steps are available.Methods appropriate to individual MSWLFs should be selected by the owneror operator, subject to State approval.While the existing Part 257 Criteria and current Subtitle C requirementsdo not address seismic impact zones, additional location restrictions forhazardous waste disposal facilities under Subtitle C of RCRA are beingdeveloped, and a standard consistent with today's proposal is being considered.The Agency believes that this standard is appropriate for MSWLFs becausethe concerns relating to failure of containment structures are the samefor any landfill regardless of waste type. The Agency requests commenton the approach proposed today.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Section 258.15 Unstable Areas</ITAG>EPA is proposing to require owners and operators of new and existing MSWLFunits located in unstable areas to demonstrate to the State the structuralstability of the unit. This demonstration must show that engineering measureshave been incorporated into the design of the unit to mitigate the potentialadverse impacts on the structural components of the unit that may resultfrom destabilizing events.Structural components include liners, leachate collection systems, finalcovers, and run-on and run-off collection systems. Facilities located inunstable areas may require extensive repairs and/or corrective action followingthe occurrence of a natural or human-induced destabilizing event. EPA hasreviewed documented events that illustrate the problems of locating wastemanagement units in unstable areas (Ref. 2). The impacts resulting fromnatural or human-induced destabilizing events observed include rapid dispersionof contaminants over a large area, contamination of municipal water supplies,and seepage of contaminants into basements. EPA is proposing to define an unstable area as a location that is susceptibleto natural or human-induced events or forces capable of impairing the integrityof the landfill structural components responsible for preventing releases.These areas could include: (1) Subsidence-prone areas, such as areas subjectto the lowering or collapse of the land surface either locally or overbroad regional areas; (2) areas susceptible to mass movement where thedownslope movement of soil and rock under gravitational influence occurs;(3) weak and unstable soils, such as soils that lose their ability to supportfoundations as a result of expansion or shrinkage; and (4) Karst terrains,which are areas where solution cavities and caverns develop in limestoneor dolomitic materials. National maps are available that locate Karst terrains and landslide-susceptibleareas, but weak and unstable soils and subsidence-prone areas appear tobe mapped only individually or at the local level. Thus, identificationof existing MSWLFs in these unstable areas, and determination of whetherthe proposed site of a new MSWLF is in an unstable area, would take placeon a case-by-case basis where geographic delineation of these areas isnot available on a national scale. A detailed description and discussion of each of the types of unstableareas identified is contained in a background document (Ref. 2) and a briefsummary of each type and the potential threats to MSWLFs follow.Subsidence-prone areas are those subject to surface subsidence becauseof natural subsurface conditions, such as Karst formations, or human-madesubsurface activities, such as fluid withdrawal or mining. Subsidence ata facility can result in rupture, deformation, or other damage to linersor final covers that may release waste directly into the environment.Areas susceptible to mass movements include areas with evidence of ongoingslope failure; areas where a small increase in shear stress or a smalldecrease in shear strength might cause slope failure; areas where geologicallysimilar locations in the same general areas have failed; and areas in thevicinity of pre-existing slope failures. Susceptibility to mass movementis determined from geotechnical and geologic studies.``Mass movement'' covers a variety of slope failures and rapid movementof materials downslope by gravitational influences including landslides,avalanches, flows, creeps, solifluction, block sliding, or a combinationof these. Mass movements are caused by imbalances between the forces ofgravity (shear stress) acting on the mass of soil or rock composing theslope and the shear strength of the mass. Human activity and natural eventscan increase the shear stress acting on the mass and/or reduce the mass'shear strength, thereby causing failure. Human-induced causes of mass movementinclude, but are not limited to, construction operations, seepage fromhuman-made sources of water, and stormwater drainage. Naturally occurringslope failures may be caused by large volumes of water from intense rainsor melting snows, vibrations and shock waves generated by earthquakes,frost and freeze/thaw cycles, or intense drying of soils. Mass movements,whether naturally occurring or induced, can carry a facility downslope,rupture a facility in place, or destroy facility control and monitoringsystems.Weak and unstable soils include unconsolidated deposits subject to differentialand excessive settlement. This movement under and around a facility cantear liners, rupture dikes, render leachate collection systems inoperable,and possibly alter the ground-water flow.Karst terrains are areas underlain by limestone and dolomite and oftenare characterized by extensive solution cavities, sinkholes, and fractures.Sinkhole formation, which may occur in certain types of Karst terrains,can cause rupture of unit liners and covers and can result in collapseof the facility. Karst terrains also promote more rapid movement of leachatefrom the landfill due to extensive fractures and secondary porosity. Basedon map overlays of Karst areas and MSWLF locations, EPA estimates that4-percent of all existing MSWLFs are in Karst terrain; however, not allKarst terrains would be considered unstable under today's proposal.Under the proposed requirement, the owner or operator of a new MSWLF mustdetermine, and demonstrate to the State, that the proposed site is notsubject to any of these destabilizing events. This demonstration shouldbe maintained in the facility file by the owner or operator as part ofthe permit application. The following factors should be considered in determiningwhether an area is unstable: (1) Soil conditions that may result in significantdifferential settling resulting in damage and failure of dikes, berms,or containment structures (for example, the presence of expansive claysthat expand when wet and shrink when dry); (2) geologic or geomorphologicfeatures such as mass-movement-prone areas, Karst terrains, or fissuresthat may result in sudden or nonsudden ground movement and subsequent failureof dikes, berms, or containment structures; (3) human-induced featuresor events (both surface and subsurface) such as areas of extensive withdrawalof oil, gas, or water from subsurface formations or construction operationsthat may result in sudden or nonsudden ground movement and subsequent failureof dikes, berms, or containment structures; and (4) any other featuresthat historically indicate that a natural or human-induced event may impairthe engineered structures of the unit and for which protective measurescannot be designed to withstand the event, such as volcanic activity areas.EPA is proposing to require this case-by-case determination of instabilitybecause of the difficulty of clearly delineating unstable areas on a broadscale. EPA believes that case-by-case decisionmaking allows the soundestanalysis under the circumstances. Subtitle C currently does not addressunstable areas; however, the Subtitle C rules are being reviewed and standardsconsistent with today's proposal are being considered. EPA believes thattoday's standard is appropriate for MSWLFs because the concerns relatingto failure of containment structures are the same for any landfill regardlessof waste type.Because failure of existing units as a result of destabilizing events inunstable areas poses potential threats to human health and the environment,the Agency is proposing that units that cannot make the structural stabilitydemonstration be closed over time. In EPA's view, continued operation ofsuch units would only increase the possible contaminant loading on theenvironment in the event of failure. In recognition of the practicablecapability of the owner or operator to secure a replacement site, EPA isproposing that existing units in unstable areas close within five yearsof the effective date of the rule. Upon closure, the owner or operatorof these facilities would not be required to remove the waste from theunit because removal of the wastes involves certain risks, and EPA believesremoval of the wastes would be a great burden and expense to owners andoperators and would exceed the practicable capability of the regulatedcommunity.EPA has selected five years as a phase-out period based upon the beliefthat five years is adequate time for proper facility closure and for sitingand construction of a new facility in an acceptable location. The activitiesthat EPA expects to occur during this period include hydrogeologic investigationsand site selection, land acquisition, and design, permitting, and constructionof the new facility. The Agency is unable to estimate the number of facilitiesthat would be affected by this requirement. EPA requests comments on theconcept of a phase-out period, the appropriate length of the phase-outperiod, and the number of facilities affected.EPA recognizes that, in some cases, it may not be possible to find a suitablesite and construct a replacement MSWLF within five years. To address thissituation, EPA also is proposing a variance to the required phase-out thatwould allow the State to extend (but not waive) the five-year period ifno ``practicable alternative'' is available and if the existing MSWLF unitwill not pose a substantial risk to human health and the environment. TheAgency believes this variance is appropriate and justifiable under section4010 of RCRA, which allows EPA to consider the ``practicable capability''of facilities to comply with the Criteria. The variance would allow forState flexibility to determine the length of the time extension and torequire any interim controls necessary to protect human health and theenvironment. During the extension period, the owner or operator would beresponsible for meeting all other applicable requirements in today's proposal.In deciding whether to grant a variance, EPA would expect the State toconsider whether (1) it currently is not economically feasible to find,develop, and operate a new site; (2) it currently is not logistically feasibleto locate a new MSWLF in a more suitable area (e.g., the only suitableproperty is already developed or is located too far from collection centers);or (3) legal barriers exist to the siting, acquisition, or operation ofthe landfill in suitable areas (e.g., jurisdictional restrictions do notallow wastes from one municipality to be disposed of in the jurisdictionof another). If such conditions exist, and the risks associated with continuedoperation during the extended period of time do not pose undue threatsto human health and the environment, a variance may be appropriate. A specificrisk level is not being proposed because the Agency believes that sucha decision is best left to the States, who must weigh the various alternatives.The Agency recognizes that States may interpret the above criteria in variousways, and that decisions may be based on site-specific conditions. TheAgency believes that this is appropriate, since the States are in a betterposition than EPA to determine whether a specific facility should be grantedan extension.Although it may be difficult to site a new MSWLF within the proposed five-yearperiod, EPA does not intend that States grant unlimited time extensionsto units located in unstable areas. Various alternatives, such as regionalizationof disposal facilities, recycling and source reduction, municipal wastecombustion (i.e., incineration), and the use of transfer stations, areavailable to manage wastes. These alternatives can be used to overcomeenvironmental, logistical, legal, or economic barriers to siting new landfills.EPA requests comments on whether other location restrictions such as theseor others in addition to those proposed today should be imposed for MSWLFs.C. Subpart C_Operating CriteriaThe requirements of this Subpart would apply to all new and existing MSWLFs.These requirements address day-to-day activities, such as application ofdaily cover (necessary to reduce immediate threats to public health), andlong-term activities, such as post-closure care (necessary to minimizeor eliminate the possibility of the release of contaminants to the environment).<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Section 258.20 Procedures for Excluding the Receipt of HazardousWaste</ITAG>Section 258.20 of today's proposal would require the owner or operatorof an MSWLF to implement a program to detect and prevent attempts to disposeof hazardous wastes (regulated under Subtitle C of RCRA) and PCB wastesat the facility (regulated under the Toxic Substances Control Act). EPAdoes not intend for this regulation to limit the legal disposal in MSWLFsof very small quantity generator (VSQG) hazardous waste (hazardous wastegenerated at a rate of less than 100 kg per month), certain wastes containingPCBs at concentrations less than 50 ppm, and empty pesticide containersthat have been properly rinsed in accordance with the label instructionsas specified under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and RodenticideAct (FIFRA) and regulations in 40 CFR Part 165. Today's proposal also doesnot restrict the disposal in MSWLFs of HHW, which is exempt from EPA'shazardous waste rules; however, the Agency strongly endorses HHW collectionprograms and recommends the management of collected HHW in hazardous wastemanagement facilities.With regard to the disposal of PCBs, regulations promulgated under theToxic Substance Control Act (TSCA) specify MSWLF disposal as proper forlimited categories of PCB materials. Such materials include drained PCB-contaminatedelectrical equipment (i.e., equipment that formerly contained 50 to 500ppm of PCBs in dielectric fluids), drained hydraulic and heat transferequipment, and ``PCB articles'' (see 40 CFR 761.3 and 761.60(b)(5)) thatpreviously contained 50 to 500 ppm of PCBs and that have been drained offree-flowing liquids. Most significantly, TSCA disposal regulations generallyallow the disposal in MSWLFs of ``small capacitors'' that contain lessthan three pounds of PCB dielectric. These small capacitors frequentlyare found in fluorescent light ballasts, high-intensity discharge lightingpower supplies, and a variety of consumer appliances, such as microwaveovens and air conditioners.Measures that MSWLF owners and operators must incorporate in their programsto exclude receipt of hazardous waste include, at a minimum, random inspectionsof incoming loads, inspection of suspicious loads, recordkeeping of inspectionresults, training of personnel to recognize hazardous waste, and proceduresfor notifying the proper State authorities if a regulated hazardous wasteis found at the facility. The State may require additional program elements.The random load checking program is a crucial deterrent to illegal disposal.Such a program might include designation of an inspector to examine severalrandom loads throughout facility operations. The loads could be dischargedat a designated location separate from landfilling operations, broken downwith hand tools, and visually inspected for indications that suspiciouscontainers may hold Subtitle C hazardous wastes. The rule could requirethat records be kept of each load inspection. The records should includethe date, time, name of the hauling firm, driver, source of the waste,vehicle identification numbers, and all observations made by the inspector.Each MSWLF would be required to train all necessary personnel to identifypotential sources of Subtitle C hazardous wastes. At a minimum, this shouldinclude supervisors, spotters, designated inspectors, equipment operators,and weigh station attendants. The training should emphasize familiaritywith containers and labels typically used for hazardous wastes and otherhazardous materials. If Subtitle C hazardous waste is found in any loadinspected, or otherwise found at the facility, the owner or operator shouldpromptly notify the State. The owner or operator should cordon off thearea where the material was deposited and make efforts to carry out propercleanup, transport, and disposal of the material at a permitted hazardouswaste management facility.In developing this proposal, EPA considered specifying the program in detail,delineating all activities and procedures needed to exclude hazardous waste.The Agency decided against a strictly defined program because each landfillwill receive different amounts of waste that could contain questionablematerial. Today's proposal gives States and MSWLF owners and operatorsflexibility in implementing this requirement.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Section 258.21 Cover Material Requirements</ITAG>EPA proposes to strengthen the cover material criterion imposed under andSection;257.3-6 of the existing Subtitle D Criteria to require the applicationof suitable cover material at the end of each operating day, or at morefrequent intervals, if necessary, to control disease vectors, fires, odors,blowing litter, and scavenging. MSWLFs receive wastes that consist of awide variety of materials. In particular, such facilities receive wastesthat contain putrescible materials. As discussed in the background documentfor this section of the proposal (Ref. 3), the disposal of such materialsin MSWLFs results in conditions conducive to the harborage of rodents andother disease vectors. EPA is proposing this requirement because problemsassociated with putrescible waste at MSWLFs are alleviated in part by covermaterial. In addition, 45 States and Territories require daily cover, suggestingthat this is an effective procedure and that, by not requiring daily cover,the current Criteria are not sufficient.Cover material serves several specific purposes for protecting human healthand the environment: (1) It helps in disease vector and rodent control;(2) it helps contain odor, litter, and air emissions, which may threatenhuman health and environment and/or be aesthetically displeasing; (3) itlessens the risk and spread of fires; and (4) it reduces infiltration ofrainwater by increasing run-off and thereby decreases leachate generationand surface and ground-water contamination. As an additional benefit, coverenhances the site appearance and utilization after completion.EPA has not specified the type or amount of cover material to be used,leaving the determination of ``suitable material'' and minimum depth upto the State; however, EPA recommends that a six-inch depth of compactedearthen material be used as cover material. Tests have shown that 6 inchesof compacted sandy loam prevent fly emergence; daily (or more frequent)cover has been shown to reduce the attraction of birds and to discouragerodents from burrowing into the waste. In addition, 45 States and Territoriesalready specifically require 6 inches of daily cover and it is consideredan accepted practice at most MSWLFs. This and other aspects of cover materialare discussed in the background document for this section (Ref. 3).Today's proposal allows the States to temporarily waive the daily coverrequirement on a case-by-case basis in the event of extreme seasonal climateconditions, such as heavy snow or severe freezing, that make meeting therequirement impractical. This provision would allow the State to considerthe practicable capability of the regulated community. EPA requests commentson the appropriateness of the frequency and depth of cover applicationand on whether there are other reasons for exempting daily cover. EPA alsois requesting comments on the acceptability of cover materials other thanearthen materials (e.g., foams).<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Section 258.22 Disease Vector Control</ITAG>Today's proposal would require that each owner or operator of an MSWLFprevent or control on-site disease vector populations using appropriatetechniques to protect human health and the environment. This requirementis consistent with existing andSection; 257.3-6, which states that ``[t]hefacility or practice shall not exist or occur unless the on-site populationof disease vectors is minimized through the periodic application of covermaterial or other techniques as appropriate so as to protect public health.''Municipal wastes are known to contain pathogenic bacteria, parasites, andviruses that can infect humans and animals. These wastes also provide foodand harborage from rodents, flies, and mosquitoes that then transmit diseaseorganisms to humans and animals.The performance criterion set forth in this section would provide Statesand MSWLF owners and operators flexibility in meeting this requirementto accommodate site-specific differences in vectors and in appropriatecontrol technologies and mechanisms. Today's proposed standard to controldisease vectors is intended to prevent the facility from being a breedingground, habitat, or a feeding area for disease vector populations. Therequirements for vector control are to be undertaken in conjunction withthe cover material requirements in andSection; 258.21. Cover material appliedat the end of each operating day reduces the availability of food and harboragefor rodents and other vectors and thus may be adequate in most cases tomeet the performance criterion for disease vector control; however, ifcover material requirements prove insufficient to ensure vector control,this criterion would require that other steps be taken by the owner oroperator to ensure such control. The background document for this sectiondiscusses various methods for minimizing disease vectors (Ref. 3).<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Section 258.23 Explosive Gases Control</ITAG>The decomposition of solid waste (in particular, household waste) producesmethane, an explosive gas. The accumulation of methane gas in MSWLF structuresor nearby off-site structures can result in fire and explosions, potentiallyinjuring or killing employees, users of the disposal site, and occupantsof nearby structures, in addition to damaging containment structures resultingin the emission of toxic fumes. Several incidents resulting in deaths arediscussed in the background document (Ref. 3).For this reason, EPA established an explosive gas criterion in andSection;257.3-8 of the original Subtitle D Criteria to regulate the concentrationof methane in facility structures and at the property boundary. This requirementis expanded in today's proposal. The lower explosive limit (LEL) of a gasis the lowest percent, by volume, of that gas in a mixture of explosivegases that will propagate a flame in air at 25anddegrees;C and atmosphericpressure at sea level. Today's proposal would require that the concentrationof methane generated by the MSWLFs not exceed 25 percent of the LEL infacility structures (excluding gas control or recovery system components)and the LEL itself at the property boundary. EPA based its selection ofthe 25 percent figure for the Criteria on a safety factor recognized byother Federal agencies as being appropriate for similar situations (Ref.3); however, the Agency concluded that a 25 percent criterion was unnecessaryat the property boundary because gases at or below the LEL at the propertyboundary will become somewhat diffused before passing into a structurebeyond the property boundary. For these reasons, EPA continues to believethat the LEL standard would provide an adequate safety margin against off-siteexplosions. The Agency believes that these limits are protective of humanhealth and the environment while not being unduly restrictive.Further, the proposal includes routine subsurface and facility structuregas monitoring requirements and a requirement that, if methane exceedsthe limits specified, the owner or operator must take necessary steps toensure protection of human health and immediately notify the State of thelevel detected and the steps taken to protect human health. Such stepscould include evacuation and ventilation of affected buildings. In addition,the Agency is proposing that the owner or operator submit a remediationplan to the State within 14 days of limits having been exceeded. This remediationplan must describe the nature and extent of the problem and the proposedremedy. Examples of appropriate remedies include installation of interceptorgas collection trenches, venting in structures, and subsurface gas withdrawal.The owner or operator would be required to implement the plan after Stateapproval.In reviewing damage cases that have occurred as a result of methane migrationfrom landfills, the Agency has noted that many of these incidents haveoccurred since promulgation in 1979 of the existing Criteria, which donot require routine gas monitoring. The Agency believes many of these instancescould have been prevented if routine monitoring had been conducted to detectthe dangerous levels prior to the incident. This issue is further discussedin the background document (Ref. 3). Early warning would allow the owneror operator to take action to prevent catastrophic events.Because methane has been the principal source of explosions associatedwith solid waste disposal, EPA proposes to require monitoring only formethane at this time. EPA may require monitoring for other gases if newinformation develops at a later time indicating that there are other gasesthat pose problems; however, EPA currently does not have sufficient informationon other gases generated to justify requiring owners and operators to monitorfor them.EPA is proposing that methane monitoring be conducted at least quarterly.As mentioned earlier, monitoring would provide early warning of potentialmethane build-up that may lead to explosions. The Agency believes thatquarterly monitoring is a reasonable minimum frequency that accounts forthe seasonal variations in subsurface gas migration patterns. The Agencyrecognizes that site-specific conditions may require more frequent monitoring,e.g., when facilities are near residential areas or enclosed in structures,and encourages States to require additional monitoring as necessary. Therealso may be limited situations (e.g., in very remote areas) where lessfrequent monitoring may be sufficient. EPA requests comment on these situationsand the appropriateness of the minimum monitoring frequency specified intoday's proposal.Monitoring is intended to ensure that the performance standard is beingmet at the MSWLF. EPA considered specifying the type of monitoring andmonitoring devices, but such an approach would not allow the considerationof site-specific factors in establishing the appropriate monitoring system.The proposal would allow State flexibility in determining the appropriatemonitoring requirements on a case-by-case basis.Site-specific factors to be considered when determining the type and frequencyof monitoring are discussed in an Agency guidance manual (Ref. 12). Factorsto be considered in determining the type and frequency of monitoring include:soil conditions, hydrogeologic conditions surrounding the disposal site,hydraulic conditions surrounding the disposal site, and the location offacility structures and relative to property boundaries. These factorscontrol the rate and extent of gas migration and are discussed furtherin the guidance manual (Ref. 12).Monitoring in a facility structure normally should be performed after thebuilding has been closed overnight or for a weekend because these are thetimes when the most dangerous conditions are likely to exist. Samplingshould be done in confined areas where gas may accumulate, such as in basements,crawl spaces, attics near floor cracks, and ground subsurface utility connections.Gas recovery and gas control equipment, however, need not be sampled. Ifall the readings are less than 25 percent LEL, the MSWLF would be in compliance;however, the presence of any methane in a facility structure, even in concentrationsbelow 25 percent LEL, should be considered a problem that deserves attentionand steps should be taken to ensure that the level of methane does notreach explosive levels. EPA recommends that continuous monitoring devicesbe used in facility structures at the landfill site.For monitoring along property boundaries, at least two monitoring pointsshould be located along the property boundaries closest to residences orother potentially affected structures. The exact location of these pointsshould take into account any gas-permeable seams. In selecting the samplingpoints, some of the factors to consider include dry sand or gravel pockets,alignment with an off-site point of concern, proximity of the waste deposit,areas where there is dead or unhealthy vegetation that might be due togas migration, and areas where underground construction may have createda natural path for gas flow (e.g., utility lines).Monitoring should be conducted at the property boundaries ideally whenthe soil surface has been wet or frozen for several days because this iswhen levels are expected to be greatest (Ref. 12). The results, location,date, and time of monitoring should be recorded. If any of the readingsare equal to or greater than the LEL, the facility would not be in compliance.It may be necessary to repeat the tests at a later date or under differentclimatic conditions to verify the readings. Where active control systemsare being used, samples should be taken when all pumps have been shut downfor their maximum time during normal operation.Monitoring at the property boundary could be accomplished by using a permanentwell or a portable monitoring device. The device should be determined bythe State on a case-by-case basis. EPA has provided additional guidanceon types of monitoring devices that could be used (Ref. 12). The Agencysuggests that methane at a concentration just below the LEL at a monitoringpoint may indicate a major problem and should not be ignored. The appropriateaction would depend on the proximity of off-site structures, possible pathways,and other factors. In all cases, an evaluation should be made so that thedanger of explosion is minimized.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Section 258.24 Air Criteria</ITAG>The existing Criteria in Part 257 prohibit the open burning of solid wastebut allow infrequent burning of agricultural wastes, silvicultural wastes,land clearing debris, diseased trees, debris from emergency cleanup operations,and ordnance. Today's proposal under andSection; 258.24 maintains this standard.Requirements for compliance with State Implementation Plans (SIPs) undersection 110 of the Clean Air Act (CAA) would remain unchanged from thePart 257 Criteria.The Agency believes that any infrequent burning of the waste types listedabove should be conducted in areas dedicated for that purpose and at adistance away from the landfill unit so as to preclude the accidental burningof other solid waste. For the purposes of this proposal, agricultural wastedoes not include empty pesticide containers or waste pesticides. Open burning, which is the uncontrolled or unconfined combustion of solidwastes, is a potential health hazard, damages property, and can be a threatto public safety. For example, smoke from open burning can reduce aircraftand automobile visibility and has been linked to automobile accidents anddeath on expressways. The air emissions associated with open burning aremuch higher than those associated with incinerators equipped with air pollutioncontrol devices. Combustion in a trench or pit incinerator is consideredthe equivalent of open burning because particulate emissions from trenchand pit incinerators equal or exceed those from open burning. As stated earlier, EPA originally established the ban on open burning inthe 1979 Criteria. Commenters on the proposal to the 1979 Criteria questionedthe necessity for that ban, stating that open burning reduces the volumeof solid waste and helps control disease vectors. The Agency recognizedthat some volume reduction is achieved, but no data were provided thatdisease vectors were significantly reduced. EPA established the ban onopen burning of these wastes because the hazards posed to human health(e.g., increase in particulate emissions, decreased safety) outweighedany benefits derived from the practice. Since the promulgation of the currentPart 257 Criteria, the Agency has not received any new data that wouldcontradict this conclusion. Therefore, EPA is retaining the open burningprohibition in today's proposal. The Agency is aware that some States allow certain communities to openburn routinely municipal solid waste under certain circumstances. Suchcommunities usually generate small amounts of waste and are in remote areas.The major advantage claimed is substantial volume reduction in the wasteto be disposed of, thus extending landfill life. These communities assertthat disposal costs would increase dramatically if there were strict enforcementof the Federal ban on open burning; however, these communities have notaddressed the impacts on human health and the environment resulting fromthe practice on open burning, and, because health and environmental concernsare the underlying reason for the ban, the Agency does not intend to changethe requirement from the 1979 Criteria. However, because EPA has receivedthese comments stating that open burning is a necessary disposal practice,the Agency is specifically requesting comment on this issue. This proposal retains the requirement that new and existing MSWLFs notviolate applicable requirements developed under a SIP approved or promulgatedby the Administrator under the CAA Section 110, as amended. EPA originallyinstituted this requirement because regional health concerns addressedthrough the SIPs clearly are of concern under RCRA as well as the CAA.Obviously, RCRA regulations should not undermine the provisions that implementthe CAA. Recent studies conducted by the Agency indicate that MSWLFs also appearto be a source of air pollutants. Gases of decomposition originate withinthe landfill and vent to the atmosphere by vertical migration and/or lateralmigration. Landfill gas is generated by chemical reactions and by microbialdegradation of refuse materials into a variety of simpler compounds. Typically,landfill gas consists of approximately 50 percent methane, 50 percent carbondioxide, and trace constitutents of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) andother toxic constituents. Pollutants commonly found in MSWLF gas includevinyl chloride, benzene, trichloroethylene, and methylene chloride. Itis estimated that approximately 200,000 metric tons of nonmethane organicsper year are emitted nationwide from existing MSWLFs. Some of these compoundscan create an odor nuisance while the VOCs and other toxic emissions canconstitute a health hazard. This is in addition to the dangers from theexplosion potential of methane (as described above). Air emissions from MSWLFs can be controlled by collecting and controlling(or recovering) the extracted landfill gas. At approximately 100 landfills,gas is collected and used as recovered energy. Control systems can be economicallyattractive due to the energy recovery benefits, especially at larger landfills.There are sites controlling or recovering landfill gas in many States,including California, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Texas,Wisconsin, and Washington. EPA has decided to regulate MSWLF air emissions under the CAA Section 111(b)for new landfills and Section 111(d) for existing landfills. Under Section111(d), EPA is preparing air emission guidelines that are to be adoptedby States; they will prepare plans for controlling existing sources ofMSWLF air emissions according to the EPA guidelines. The regulations willbe based on both collecting and controlling landfill gas. EPA plans topropose air emission standards for MSWLFs in the near future. <ITAG tagnum="81">6. Section 258.25 Access Requirements </ITAG>EPA is proposing to require control of public access at new and existingMSWLFs to prevent illegal dumping of wastes and public exposure to hazardsat MSWLFs as well as to prevent unauthorized vehicular traffic. Accesscontrol is a key element in preventing injury or death at these facilities.Because EPA also is concerned with the unauthorized dumping of hazardouswaste, the proposed requirement expands on the existing 257.3-8 healthand safety criteria, which prohibit uncontrolled public access, by addingrequirements to control illegal dumping of wastes and unauthorized vehiculartraffic. EPA proposes that MSWLF owners or operators control public access, illegaldumping, and unauthorized vehicular traffic using natural and/or artificialbarriers, as appropriate, to protect human health and the environment.Steps needed to comply with this standard would be determined by the Stateon a site-specific basis. At some facilities, it may not be necessary toconstruct any artificial barriers, such as fences, in order to comply withthis criterion. Such facilities include, for example, those located inremote areas away from the general public or in areas with mountainousterrain or cliffs that would make access by the general public difficult.Posting signs and gates across access roads may be sufficient in remoteareas to prevent public access that could lead to injuries; however, facilitiesthat are located near residential areas or other public areas may be requiredto construct fences in order to control access. Unauthorized vehiculartraffic and illegal dumping could be prevented by placing gates with locksat all entrances to a remote site. Other provisions may be necessary ona site-by-site basis. Under the Subtitle C regulations, the owner or operator must prevent unknowingentry, and minimize the possibility for unauthorized entry, onto the activeportions of the facility. At a minimum, a hazardous waste facility musthave a 24-hour surveillance system or an artificial or natural barrier,such as a fence in good repair or a fence in combination with a cliff thatcompletely surrounds the active portion of the facility, and a means tocontrol entry at all times. The requirements may be waived under SubtitleC if it can be demonstrated that physical contact with the waste or equipmentwill not injure unauthorized persons or livestock and disturbance of thewaste or equipment will not threaten human health and the environment.These Subtitle C requirements are considered unnecessary for MSWLFs becauseEPA believes the risks associated with direct contact with municipal solidwastes are less than those associated with hazardous waste. Today's proposalallows greater consideration of site-specific conditions in establishingthe appropriate controls than the Subtitle C regulations do. For example,as discussed above, the remoteness of a site may serve as an adequate ``naturalbarrier'' to facility access. EPA believes that simply requiring ownersor operators to control public access allows the owner or operator to implementa system tailored to site-specific characteristics. <ITAG tagnum="81">7. Section 258.26 Run-on/Run-off Control Systems </ITAG>EPA is proposing run-on and run-off control requirements. These requirementsare interrelated in that diversion of run-on reduces the amount of run-offthat needs to be collected. The proposal would require that the owner oroperator of an MSWLF design, construct, and maintain a run-on control systemto prevent flow onto the active portion of the MSWLF during the peak dischargeof a 25-year storm. The purpose of the run-on standard is to minimize theamount of surface water entering the landfill facility. Run-on controlsprevent: (1) Erosion, which may damage the physical structure of the landfill(2) the surface discharge of wastes in solution or suspension, and (3)the downward percolation of run-on through wastes, creating leachate. Controlis accomplished by constructing diversion structures to prevent surfacewater run-on from entering the active portion of the facility. Diversionstructures help prevent liquids, which will eventually generate leachateor leave the site as contaminated run-off, from coming into contact withthe waste. The Agency believes that the main area of concern, with respect to run-on,is the active portion of the landfill, not the landfill facility as a whole.In this proposal, that part of the facility or unit that has received oris receiving wastes and has not been closed as required in andSection; 258.30is defined as the active portion. It is at active portions that run-onis most likely to: (1) Seep into the exposed waste, contributing to theformation of leachate, or (2) erode wastes, or constituents of them, andcarry them away in surface water run-off. Seepage and erosion would notbe a problem at inactive portions that have been closed in accordance withthe closure Criteria specified in andSection; 258.30. The Agency proposesthat surface water run-on be diverted from active portions. Diversion ofrun-on may be accomplished by locating the active portion in areas wherethe topography naturally prevents run-on, by sloping or contouring theland, or by constructing ditches, culverts, or dikes. The capacity of diversionstructures should be determined by the owner or operator considering sitetopography, size of the drainage area, and size of the active portions.The Agency chose the 25-year storm as the design parameter to be consistentwith the standard in 40 CFR Part 264, which requires active portions ofhazardous waste landfills to be protected from the peak discharge of a25-year storm. The quantity of run-off from active portions of landfills can be minimizedby (1) minimizing run-on, (2) preventing disposal of liquid wastes in thelandfill, and (3) minimizing the size of the active portion of the landfill.To address run-off that is generated, the Agency proposes to require thatthe owner or operator of an MSWLF design, construct, and maintain a run-offcontrol system from the active portion of the landfill to collect and controlat least the water volume resulting from a 24-hour, 25-year storm. Run-offfrom the active portion of the unit must be handled in accordance withandSection; 258.27 of this proposal in order to ensure that the CWA NPDESrequirements and CWA Section 208 and 319 requirements are not violated.Again, the Agency chose the 24-hour, 25-year storm design parameter tobe consistent with the standards for Subtitle C facilities in 40 CFR Part264.By design, almost all trench and area fills in depressions or pits controlmost run-off because of surface contours. Owners and operators having areafills that do not use depressions can control run-off by building a bermor dike on the low elevation side; however, when landfills using eitherthe trench or area methods become large or substantially above grade, bothrun-off and leachate seeps, which often occur on the outer slopes of thefill, need to be collected. Run-off that does emerg from active portionsmay be collected by ditches, berms, dikes, or culverts, which direct it(sometimes by sump pump) to surface impoundments, basins, tanks, or treatmentfacilities. These collection devices may consist of temporary structuresaround active portions. because run-off usually has been in contact withwaste or leachete seeps from active portions and sometimes is collectedvia a leachate collection system, it probably will be contaminated. Itis difficult to differentiate between rainwater run-off and leachate run-offat the active portion of a landfill unless an elaborate or expensive samplingprogram is conducted. Once collected, a number of options exist for treatingand disposing of run-off. These include land treatment, treatment in surfaceimpoundments (e.g., evaporation), or discharge to a sewer, other treatmentfacility, or surface waters (if permitted). The background document supportingthis section of the rule (Ref. 3) discusses in further detail 25-year stormevents and run-on and run-off control requirements.<ITAG tagnum="81">8. Section 258.27 Surface Water Requirements</ITAG>Today's proposal would prohibit any MSWLF unit from (1) causing a dischargeof pollutants into waters of the U.S., including wetlands, that violatesany requirements of the CWA, including, but not limited to, NPDES requirements;and (2) causing a nonpoint source of polution to the waters of the U.S.,including wetlands, that violates any requirements of a State-wide or area-widewater quality management plan under Section 208 or Section 319 of the CWA.The surface water criterion currently in Part 257 was retained in today'sproposal because EPA believes it provides necessary protection for humanhealth and the environment.EPA considers it essential that solid waste activities not adversely affectthe quality of the nation's surface waters. Rivers, lakes, and streamsare important sources of drinking water, recreational resources, and habitatfor a wide variety of fish with other aquatic organisms. Solid waste disposalhas led to surface water contamination from run-off of leachate, accidentialspills, and drift of spray occurring at landfills. In the proposed Criteria,EPA seeks to coordinate its surface water requirements under RCRA, includingprograms developed under the CWA to restore and maintain the integrityof the waters of the United States.Under Section 1006 of RCRA, EPA is required to integrate, to the maximumextent practicable, the provisions of RCRA with other statutes, includingthe CWA Under the CWA, EPA conducts programs designed ``to restore andmaintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the nation'swater.'' EPA believes that this goal also is a legitimate objective forits regulatory activity under RCRA and that the Agency should use its authorityunder RCRA to see that CWA goals are achieved. Thus, in establishing thesurface water criteria, EPA employed concepts and approaches use underthe CWA. The discharge of a nonpoint source of pollution from solid wastedisposal activities would be required to conform with any established waterquality management plan developed under Section 208 or Section 319 of theCWA. Not all portions of a Section 208 or Section 319 plan are applicableto solid waste disposal activities, and the State would determine whichrequirements under these plans apply. Similarly, the discharge of pollutantsfrom solid waste disposal activities would be required to comply with otherprovisions of the CWA, including the NPDES requirements under Section 402.The provision of andSection; 257.3-3 of the current Criteria, which statesthat ``a facility shall not cause a discharge of dredged material or fillmaterial to waters of the United States that is in violation of the requirementsunder Section 404 of CWA, as amended,'' has been included under the wetlandssection of today's proposed Part 258 Criteria.<ITAG tagnum="81">9. Section 258.28 Liquids Restrictions</ITAG>EPA is proposing a new requirement for liquids restrictions because theintentional introduction of liquids into landfills can be a significantsource of leachate generation. Today's proposal would prohibit bulk ornoncontainerized liquid waste that are not household waste (other thanseptic waste) from being disposed of in MSWLFs. Leachate and gas condensatethat is derived from the MSWLF unit and recirculated would be exempt fromthis prohibition if the unit has been equipped with a composite liner anda leachate collection system designed and constructed to maintain lessthan 30cm of leachate over the liner in order to ensure that the recirculatedliquids are managed properly. Containers of liquid waste could be placedin MSWLFs only when the containers: (1) Are small containers of the sizetypically found in household waste, (2) are designed to hold liquids foruse other than storage, such as a battery or capacitor, or (3) hold householdwaste.By restricting the introduction of liquids into landfills through a banon the disposal of bulk and containerized liquid waste, EPA expects tominimize the leachate generation potential of the landfills, and thus minimizethe risk of gound-water contamination. Twenty-one States and Territoriesalready prohibit disposal of liquids and semiliquid wastes in MSWLFs. EPAbelieves, therefore, that this restriction is a sound MSWLF managementpractice.The problems associated with the landfill disposal of containerized liquidwastes arise upon the eventual deterioration of the waste container. Liquidsescaping from leaking containers will migrate to the bottom of the landfill,acting as a transport and leaching medium for the wastes contained in thelandfill. Liquids accumulating on landfill liners can contribute to linerfailure through increased hydraulic pressure and/or chemical interactions.Increased hydraulic head due to liquid accumulation can increase the amountand rate of contaminant movement from the landfill to the ground water.Additionally, when waste containers degrade, allowing their contents toescape, they collapse under the pressure of the landfill. This situationcan create voids in the landfill, which can lead to slumping and subsidenceof the final cover. Once the integrity of the landfill cover is lost, infiltrationof precipitation will increase, contributing to the leachate generationin the landfill. Collapse of deteriorated waste containers and subsequentdamage to the cover material could occur after the post-closure care periodof the landfill, when ground-water monitoring systems are not maintainedto detect ground-water contamination.Disposal of bulk or noncontainerized liquids in landfills present the sameproblems that disposal of containerized liquids present once they haveleaked from this containers, namely, increased mobility of wastes in thelandfill, increased risk of loss of liner integrity through greater pressureand/or chemical interactions, and increased hydraulic head, which can increasethe rate and quantity of movement of contaminants to the ground water.EPA believes that the proposed ban on the disposal of bulk or noncontainerizedliquids (except nonseptic waste from households and recirculated leachateand gas condensate at facilities with specific designs) will greatly reducethe quantity of free liquids to be managed in MSWLFs, which, in turn, willreduce the risk of liner failure and subsequent contamination of the groundwater. The ban on containerized free liquids (except those from households)will achieve the same purposes as the ban on bulk liquids, and, in addition,will reduce the problem of subsidence and possible damage to the finalcover upon eventual deterioration of the waste containers.EPA recognizes that landfills are, in effect, biological systems that requiremoisture for decomposition to occur and that this moisture promotes decompositionof the wastes and stabilization of the landfill. Therefore, adding liquidsmay promote stabilization of the unit. Some concern has been expressedthat the Agency requirements would effectively place landfills in a stateof ``suspended animation,'' impeding stabilization by minimizing introductionof liquids. EPA does not agree with this argument for several reasons.Wastes received at landfills already contain moisture (10 percent to 35percent by volume). The Agency believes that this moisture is sufficientfor decomposition to proceed. In addition, moisture is added from rainfall,and more moisture is generated during the decomposition process. Finally,although the Agency recognizes that moisture is necessary for waste decomposition,it does not have data that indicate that allowing the deliberate introductionof liquids into a unit for stabilization purposes is beneficial and outweighsthe potential problems incurred from increased volumes of leachate.The intent of today's proposal is to prohibit the disposal of bulk or noncontainerizedliquid waste at new and existing MSWLFs units. Household waste (other thanseptic waste) is exempted because it is beyond the practicable capabilityof owners and operators to effectively restrict the disposal of all householdliquid waste. Furthermore, the primary purpose of today's liquids restrictionsis to limit the disposal of large-volume liquids in the landfill. Septicwastes would not be exempted because they are easily identifiable and restrictedif they do not pass the liquids test described below.Certain small containers (e.g., paint cans) and other wastes (e.g., batteries)would be exempt from the containerized liquids ban because they are notlikely to contribute substantial amounts of liquids at most landfills andthe difficulty of opening and emptying them appears to outweigh the smallbenefit gained (Ref. 3). EPA believes that the 18-month period betweenthe promulgation date and the effective date of the rule would allow liquidwaste disposers adequate time to develop alternatives to liquids disposalin MSWLFs.Under this proposal, the owner or operator would be required to determineif wastes (e.g., septic wastes, municipal wastewater sludge) are liquidwaste by using the Paint Filter Liquids Test method. This test method (Method9095) already has been adopted by the Subtitle C hazardous waste program(Ref. 34). As discussed earlier under the explanation for the proposeddefinition for ``liquid waste,'' the Agency requests comments on the appropriatenessof the solids content measure as an alternative to the Paint Filter LiquidsTest for POTW sludges for defining liquid waste.The Agency is proposing to allow leachate and gas condensate recirculationat MSWLF units that incorporate a composite liner and leachate collectionsystem into their design. Studies have indicated that leachate recirculationhas certain benefits, which include increasing the rate of waste stabilization,improving leachate quality, and increasing the quantity and quality ofmethane gas production. Leachate recirculation also provides a viable on-siteleachate management method. Other methods for managing leachate includedisposal in off-site POTWs or on-site treatment facilities. These othermethods, however, may not be available or practical because of limitedPOTW capacity, institutional constraints, or costs. Recent studies conductedby EPA indicate that of those facilities collecting leachate (481 MSWLFsor 5 percent of total), 42 percent (205 MSWLFs) are recirculating leachate.The Agency expects that the number of MSWLFs collecting leachate wouldincrease with the implementation of today's proposed design Criteria (SubpartD of today's proposal).The Agency recognizes that there are potential operational problems associatedwith leachate and gas condensate recirculation that may result in adverseimpacts on human health and the environment. These problems include: (1)An increase in leachate production, (2) clogging of the leachate collectionsystem (LCS), (3) buildup of hydraulic head within the unit, (4) an increasein air emissions and odor problems, and (5) an increase in the potentialof leachate polluant releases due to drift and/or run-off. Therefore, EPAis proposing that only MSWLF units designed and equipped with compositeliners and an LCS constructed to maintain less than a 30-cm depth of leachateover the liner be allowed to recirculate leachate and gas condensate.A composite liner is a system consisting of two components. The upper componentmust contain a flexible membrane liner (FML), and the lower component mustcontain at least a three-foot layer of compacted soil with hydraulic conductivityof no more than 1andmultiply;10^7 centimeters per second. The FML componentmust be installed in direct and uniform contact with the compacted soilcomponent so as to minimize the migration of leachate through the FML ifa break should occur. Because of the increased leachate generation dueto the increased amounts of liquids and subsequent hydraulic head buildup,EPA believes that the added protection provided by a composite liner isnecessary to ensure that contaminant migration to the aquifer is controlled.First, the FML portion of the liner will increase leachate collection efficiencyand provide a more effective hydraulic barrier. Second, the soil portionwill provide support for the FML and the leachate collection system andact as a back-up in the event of failure of the FML.The standard for the LCS, i.e., the requirement that it be constructedto maintain less than 30 cm of leachate over the liner, is the same standardrequired for LCSs at Subtitle C hazardous waste units, and various technologiesare available for meeting this requirement (Ref. 3). The appropriate technologydepends on the size of the unit, waste permeability, and climatic conditions.LCS design normally consists of a permeable material placed on a slopingsurface so as to allow the leachate to be removed and collected. For largeunits, a pipe drainage system also may be necessary.The Agency believes that, because of the potential problems associatedwith leachate recirculation discussed earlier, the design requirementsspecified above generally are necessary to ensure protection of human healthand the environment; however, because the data that EPA has collected onleachate recirculation are limited to laboratory studies (Ref. 24), theAgency is requesting aditional data on leachate recirculation, includingpilot studies and field data.Prior to selecting today's proposed approach, the Agency considered a widerange of options for leachate and gas condensate recirculation and is requestingcomment on two additional options. EPA considered allowing waivers to therequirement that an MSWLF have a composite liner in order to recirculateleachate. For example, the waiver could be granted if the owner or operatorcould demonstrate that: (1) The unit is located over ground water thatis not a potential or current underground source of drinking water, andsuch ground water is not interconnected to a potential or current drinkingwater source; or (2) recirculation of leachate or gas condensate in theabsence of a composite liner or leachate collection system would not resultin contamination of ground water; or (3) recirculation of leachate or gascondensate in an existing unit not equipped with a composite liner or leachatecollection system would pose lower risks to human health and the environmentthan disposal of this leachate without recirculation.Because of the previously mentioned operational problems associated withleachate and gas condensate recirculation and the limited data available,the Agency also is considering a ban on leachate and gas condensate recirculationas an alternative to today's proposal. Under this alternative, for newMSWLF units, the ban could be instituted on the effective date of the revisedCriteria and could be phased in for existing units over a period of time,possibly five years, to allow for alternative leachate management practicesto be implemented. The Agency recognizes that the area of leachate andgas condensate recirculation will be controversial and, therefore, is seekingcomment on a number of issues. The Agency is seeking comment on the appropriatenessof the proposed design requirements and whether other designs would provideadequate protection, and whether today's proposed requirement should bemodified to allow the State greater flexibility in establishing appropriatedesign controls. The Agency is requesting comment on the above approachesto granting the waivers and is interested in receiving information on howto develop the necessary waiver demonstrations. Finally, EPA is specificallyrequesting comments on banning leachate and gas condensate recirculation.<ITAG tagnum="81">10. Section 258.29 Recordkeeping Requirements</ITAG>EPA has included a recordkeeping requirement in these proposed Criteriato ensure that a historical record of MSWLF performance is maintained.The owner or operator would be required to maintain the following records:Ground-water monitoring, testing, or analytical data as specified underSubpart E of today's proposal; gas monitoring results; inspection records,training procedures, and State notification procedures as specified underandSection; 258.20 of today's proposal; and closure and post-closure careplans required under proposed andSection;andSection; 258.30(b) and 258.31(c),respectively. The required information would be recorded as it becomesavailable, and maintained by the owner or operator of new and existingMSWLFs. This section consolidates the recordkeeping requirements of othersections of today's proposal.EPA believes that this requirement would ensure the availability of basictypes of information that demonstrates compliance with today's requirements.EPA has not defined the time period for retaining these records, requiredthat reports should be submitted, nor specified in what form records shouldbe maintained because the Agency believes it is more appropriate for theserequirements to be specified by States, which are directly responsiblefor implementing these provisions. EPA believes this requirement is flexibleenough to allow the States to establish specific requirements for recordkeepingand to determine if additional records should be maintained. <ITAG tagnum="81">11. Section 258.30 Closure Criteria</ITAG>Because of the potential threats to human health and the environment posedby MSWLFs, the Agency believes that is necessary to prescribe minimum standardsfor closing these landfills. Improperly closed landfills, as discussedin a background document (Ref. 3), have the potential for contaminatingthe environment due to inadequate controls to contain the wastes (e.g.,a final cap that erodes and fails to protect the wastes from being exposed).For this reason, the Agency is proposing criteria for closure of MSWLFsin andSection; 258.30 of today's proposal to ensure that owners and operatorsprevent threats to human health and the environment caused by improperlandfill closure. The closure criteria proposed today specify a closure performance standardthat the owner of operator must meet that will minimize the need for maintenanceafter closure and minimize the formation and release of leachate and explosivegases during the post-closure care period. Owners or operators must preparea closure plan, to be approved by the State, that describes the activitiesto be undertaken at the landfill to close it in accordance with the closureperformance standard. Because prompt closure of a landfill is importantto minimize potential threats to human health and the environment, theAgency is proposing that closure must begin promptly after the final receiptof waste at each landfill unit. To further ensure that closure is conductedproperly and in a timely manner, the owner or operator also would be requiredto submit a certification for each unit at which closure had been completedin accordance with the closure plan. Other details regarding closure (suchas deadlines and procedures for submitting, approving, and modifying closureplans; schedules and deadlines for completing closure; and other proceduralrequirements) would be left to the States in order to allow maximum flexibilitywithout compromising the intent of the closure criteria. <T3>a. Closure Performance Standard. </T3>The closure performance standardproposed by the Agency andSection; 258.30(a) of today's rule is designedto ensure that long-term protection of human health and the environmentis achieved while providing States with the flexibility to require morespecific technical closure requirements. The Agency is proposing a health-basedperformance standard for the final cover, which is discussed in SectionIX. D of this preamble. States are encouraged to specify technical standardsfor satisfying the closure performance standard (e.g., final cover designand materials, cap permeability) and may wish to refer to technical guidancematerials applicable to Subtitle C hazardous waste facilities. The components of the proposed closure performance standard are consistentwith the closure performance standard for Subtitle C hazardous waste treatment,storage, and disposal facilities. First, the MSWLF owner or operator mustclose each landfill unit (i.e., discrete cells or trenches in a mannerthat minimizes the need for further maintenance after operations cease.Second, closure activities must minimize the formation and release of leachateand explosive gases after the closure performance standard to the extentnecessary to protect human health and the environment. This dual requirementestablishes the standard for the closure applicable to all MSWLFs and,at the same time, allows owners or operators and the States to determinethe site-specific technical requirements necessary to achieve these generalgoals of protecting human health and the environment. The Agency recognizes that many owners and operators manage their landfillsin phases and close units (e.g., discret cells or trenches) as they arefilled. To ensure that the entire landfill is closed in an environmentallsound manner, the Agency is proposing that all units of the landfill beclosed in a manner that satisfies the closure performance standard, includingunits closed prior to cessation of all operations at the landfill. Thisrequirement also is consistent with the Subtitle C requirements applicableto hazardous waste facilities. <T3>b. Closure Plan. </T3>To ensure that the activities and resources necessaryto close MSWLFs in a way that will protect human health and the environmenthave been adequately considered, today's proposed andSection; 258.30(b) wouldrequire the owner or operator of each new and existing MSWLF to preparea written closure plan describing how all units of the landfill will beclosed in accordance with the closure performance standard. The closureplan also would serve as a basis for enforcing the closure performancestandard and other closure requirements under andSection; 258.30. In addition,this plan would serve as the basis for determining site-specific cost estimatesand the amount of financial assurance required under andSection; 258.32.The proposed requirement for a detailed written closure plan is consistentwith many State solid waste regulations. A survey of selected State programsindicated that many States currently require the owner or operator to demonstratethat it has prepared for closure of the facility. Section 258.30(b) of today's proposal specifies the minimum informationthat must be provided in the closure plan. States are encouraged to supplementthese requirements to ensure more complete and adequate closure plans.States may wish to refer to the regulatory and preamble language in 40CFR Parts 264 and 265, Subpart G, applicable to closure and post-closurecare standards for hazardous waste facilities, for guidance in developingmore detailed closure plan requirements. Today's proposal specifies that the closure plan must include (1) an overalldescription of the methods, procedures, and processes that will be usedto close each unit to the landfill in accordance with the closure performancestandard, including procedures for decontaminating the MSWLF, (2) an estimateof the maximum extent of operation that will be open during the activelife of the landfill, (3) an estimate of the maximum inventory of wastesever on-site over the active life of the landfill, (4) description of thefinal cover designed in accordance with andSection; 258.40(b) and andSection;258.40(c), and (5) a schedule for competing all activities necessary tosatisfy the closure performance standard. The closure plan should provide enough detail to allow the State to evaluateits adequacy. For example, the description of the activities necessaryto complete all closure activities should address removing, transporting,treating, or disposing of any waste inventory remaining at the landfill;monitoring the ground-water and managing gas and leachate during the closureperiod; controlling run-on an run-off; and decontaminating or removingcontaminated structures, equipment, and soils. Decontamination proceduresinclude the methods for decontaminating the MSWLF, sampling and testingprocedures, and criteria to be used for evaluating contamination levels.The estimate of the maximum extent of operation of the landfill shouldaccount for the largest portion of the landfill ever open at any time overthe active life of the MSWLF. An area of a landfill is considered openif it has not been closed in accordance with the technical closure requirementsin andSection;andSection; 258.30 and 258.40 (i.e., final cover). Therefore,areas that receive daily cover but are not otherwise closed in accordancewith today's provisions would be included in the estimate of the maximumextent of operation. The active life of the facility is defined in andSection;258.2 as the period from the initial receipt of wastes until certificationof closure in accordance with the requirements in andSection; 258.30(e) hasbeen submitted and approved by the State. The estimate of the maximum amountof waste inventory ever handled at the MSWLF at any time over the landfill'sactive life should be included all wastes awaiting landfilling as wellas run-off in trenches, ditches, or collection ponds. The requirementsto provide an estimate of the maximum extent of landfill operation andan estimate of the maximum amount of waste on site over the active lifeof the landfill are important to accurately estimate the cost of closure.Financial assurance for closure must be based on the maximum cost of closingthe landfill based on site-specific factors. Knowing the maximum cost ofclosure ensures that adequate funds for closure are available even if closuretakes place earlier than expected. The description of the final cover should include the design of the finalcover, the types of materials to be used, and how the final cover willachieve the objectives of the closure performance standard. Finally, theclosure schedule should include the total time required to close each landfillunit and the time for intervening closure activities that will allow theprogress of closure to be tracked (e.g., estimates of the time requiredto decontaminate the MSWLF and to place a final cover). Because today's rule applies only to MSWLFs, the estimate of the maximumextent of operation, maximum amount of inventory, and the correspondingdescription of procedures for handling these wastes refer only to thosewastes and units that are integrally a part of the operation of the MSWLF(e.g., run-off collection ponds). These regulations are not intended toaddress closure of other structures or units at the facility that may notbe part of the landfill operation (e.g., a surface impoundment used asa sludge drying bed). <T3>c. Closure Plan Deadline and Approval. </T3>EPA is proposing in andSection;258.30(c) to require that the closure plan be prepared as of the effectivedate of the rule or by the initial receipt of solid waste at the landfill,whichever is later. Based on experience with hazardous waste facilitiesunder Subtitle C, the Agency believes that the proposed deadline for preparingthe closure plan is sufficient. A responsible owner or operator alreadyshould have considered many of the types of activities required at closureas part of routine operations, especially if the landfill is operated ona cell-by-cell basis and cells are filled and closed successively. Theowner or operator of an existing MSWLF may be able to rely extensivelyon records of closure activities of areas no longer active in preparingthe plans (e.g., in developing an appropriate final cover or in determiningthe type of final cover used). The Agency also is proposing in andSection; 258.30(c) that the closure plan,and any subsequent modifications to the plan, must be approved by the Stateto ensure that the plan adequately addresses all of the required activities.This proposal is particularly important because the closure cost estimateand the amount of financial responsibility required are based directlyon the activities described in the closure plan. To allow the States maximumflexibility in developing procedures for implementing these rules, theAgency is not proposing specific deadlines and procedures for submitting,approving, and modifying closure plans. The Agency recognizes that manyStates already have approval procedures in place, making specific Federalrequirements unnecessary and potentially burdensome. For example, mostof the States surveyed approve closure plans as part of the permittingprocess and require that subsequent modifications to the plans be subjectto State approval. Other States require that owners or operators applyfor closure permits prior to closure. In developing an approval process,States may wish to review the procedures included in Subpart G of 40 CFRParts 264 and 265, and the permitting requirements in 40 CFR Parts 124and 270 that apply to hazardous waste facilities. For recordkeeping purposes, the Agency is proposing in andSection; 258.30(c)that the owner or operator maintain a copy of the most recently approvedclosure plan at the MSWLF facility, or at some other place designated bythe owner or operator, until the owner or operator has been notified bythe State that it has been released from financial assurance for closureof the entire landfill under andSection; 258.32(f). <T3>d. Triggers for Closure. </T3>To ensure that MSWLF units are closedin a timely manner after operations at the unit have ceased and to protectagainst threats to human health or the environment posed by open but inactivelandfills, the Agency is proposing in andSection; 258.30(d) that the owneror operator begin closure activities at each unit, in accordance with theapproved closure plan, no later than 30 days after the final receipt ofwastes at each landfill unit. Thus, if the MSWLF is operated on an individualcell or trench basis, closure of each cell or trench must begin within30 days following the final receipt of waste at that unit. Extensions maybe granted at the discretion of the State, if the owner or operator ofthe MSWLF demonstrates that the open landfill unit will not pose a threatto human health or the environment. These closure trigger provisions inandSection; 258.30(d) are consistent with the closure trigger mechanismsfor hazardous waste facilities under Subtitle C. States may wish to referto the language in 40 CFR Parts 264 and 265, Subpart G as guidance fordeveloping more detailed provisions. The Agency encourages States to define ``final receipt of wastes'' to precludeMSWLF units from remaining inactive for an indefinite period of time withoutclosing. For example, States may wish to adopt the provisions applicableto hazardous waste facilities that specify that closure of each unit mustbegin no later than 30 days after the final receipt of hazardous wastes,no later than one year after the most recent receipt of hazardous wastesat that unit. Furthermore, States are encouraged to establish specificcriteria for granting extensions of the deadline for beginning closure.For example, the Subtitle C regulations for hazardous waste facilitiesspecify that an extension will be granted only if the owner or operatordemonstrates, among other requirements, that (1) the facility has remainingcapacity, and (2) the owner or operator is operating in compliance withall applicable regulations and will continue to do so. As noted above, the Agency is allowing the States to develop their ownprocedural requirements, imcluding provisions for owners or operators tonotify the States of their intent to close their landfill units. Statesare encouraged to establish notification requirements that provide themwith sufficient advance notice to inspect the facility and to ensure thatthe approved closure plan is still applicable to the facility's currentconditions. States may wish to adopt the notification provisions includedin the Subtitle C regulations that require advance notice prior to closureof each unit of the landfill. If the State allows the owner or operatorto gradually fund a trust fund as demonstration of financial assurance,notice of closure is particularly important to ensure that the trust fundis fully funded at the tme of closure. For example, Subtitle C requiresan estimate of the expected year of closure to be included in the closureplan if the owner or operator expects to close the landfill prior to theend of the required trust fund pay-in period. While today's proposal specifies when closure must begin, the Agency isnot proposing deadlines for completing closure of an MSWLF unit. However,the Agency is concerned that the completion of closure not be delayed unnecessarilyand is encouraging States to specify deadlines and interim milestones.For example, the Subtitle C regulations for hazardous waste facilitiesspecify a six-month deadline for completing closure and an interim milestoneof three months for managing all inventory at the site. Extensions to thesedeadlines may be granted if (1) the closure activities will take longerthan six months to complete or (2) there is a reasonable likelihood thatthe owner or operator or a person other than the owner or operator willrecommence operation of the facility, the landfill has additional capacityto receive waste, and closure would be incompatible with continued operationof the facility. In all cases, if an extension for completing closure isgranted, the owner or operator of a Subtitle C facility remains subjectto all applicable permit requirements and must take all the necessary stepsto ensure protection of human health and the environment. The Agency requestscomment on the extent to which the revised Criteria should specify deadlinesfor completing closure. <T3>e. Closure Certification. </T3>The Agency is proposing in andSection;258.30(e) that following closure of each MSWLF unit, the owner or operatormust submit to the State a certification that closure of that unit hasbeen completed in accordance with the approved closure plan. The closurecertification must objectively verify that closure has been performed inaccordance with the closure requirements, based on a review of the landfillunit by a qualified party. State approval of closure certification willtrigger the release of the owner and operator from closure financial responsibilityrequirements under andSection; 258.32(f) (see Section 13.e below.)The Agency is leaving to the discretion of the State the types of certificationsthat satisfy the regulations; in all cases, however, the certificationmust provide an objective evaluation of site closure, based on a directreview of the MSWLF unit by a party qualified to make such an assessment.Certifications that may satisfy the criteria in today's proposal includewritten verification by an independent qualified party (e.g., an independentregistered professional engineer) or a qualified in-house registered professionalengineer at the MSWLF with knowledge about the facility's operations whocan objectively evaluate the closure activities, or an on-site review byState inspection officials. While this certification requirement allowsthe States more discretion than under Subtitle C, the intent of today'sproposed rule is consistent with the Subtitle C regulations, which requirea hazardous waste facility owner or operator to submit a certificationsigned by himself and an independent registered professional engineer thatclosure has been conducted in accordance with the approved plan.The Agency also is leaving to the States the discretion to specify a deadlinefor submitting the certification. States may wish to adopt the SubtitleC regulations that require the certifications to be submitted no laterthan 60 days after the completion of closure of each unit.<ITAG tagnum="81">12. Section 258.31 Post-Closure Care Requirements</ITAG>The closure performance standard requires the owner or operator of an MSWLFto close each landfill unit in a manner that minimizes the need for furthermaintenance and minimizes leachate and gas formation. Even when properlycarried out, however, closure cannot guarantee against long-term environmentalproblems at landfills. For this reason, the Agency is proposing that theowner or operator conduct post-closure monitoring and maintenance as necessaryto minimize future threats to human health and the environment followingclosure of each landfill unit. The post-closure care requirements proposedin andSection; 258.31 of today's rule specify the minimum activities necessaryto minimize deterioration of the final cover and to detect problems beforethey pose a threat to human health and the environment. These activitiesmust be described in the post-closure care plan under proposed andSection;258.31(c).An owner or operator must begin post-closure care activities followingclosure of each landfill unit. The Agency is proposing that this post-closurecare period comprise two phases. In the first phase, the owner or operatormust perform the post-closure care activities specified in andSection; 258.31(a)for a minimum of 30 years; during the second phase, the owner or operatormust continue to conduct certain post-closure care activities specifiedin andSection; 258.31(b). The length of this second phase would be specifiedby the State. The post-closure care plan must describe the activities inboth phases of post-closure care.<T3>a. Post-Closure Care Activities. </T3>During the first 30 years ofthe post-closure care period, the Agency is proposing that the owner oroperator conduct routine maintenance of any final cover, and continue anyleachate collection, ground-water monitoring, and gas monitoring requirementsas necessary to control the formation and release of leachate and explosivegases into the environment and maintain the integrity of these monitoringsystems. Routine maintenance of the integrity and effectiveness of thefinal cover, proposed in andSection; 258.31(a)(1), is necessary to preventliquids from penetrating into the closed landfill and creating the potentialfor leachate migration. Required activities include repairs to the finalcover to correct the effects of settling, subsidence, erosion, or otherevents, and preventing run-on and run-off from eroding or damaging thecover. Cover maintenance also includes periodic cap replacement, whichis necessary to remediate the effects of routine deterioration. These activitiesare intended to promote the Agency's overall goal of minimizing liquidsin landfills and are the minimum steps the Agency believes are necessaryto protect human health and the environment in the long term. The Agencybelieves that these requirements also should provide an incentive to properlymanage solid wastes (e.g., ensuring proper compaction of wastes) duringthe active life of the landfill.The Agency is proposing in andSection; 258.31(a)(2) that owners or operatorsof MSWLFs designed with liner(s) and leachate collection systems continueto operate and maintain the leachate collection system during the post-closurecare period in accordance with the requirements of andSection; 258.40(b).Experience has shown that leachate generation in landfills continues longafter closure. Therefore, to avoid leachate collecting on top of the linerand causing the ``bathtub effect,'' the owner or operator must continueto remove leachate from the collection system during the post-closure careperiod until leachate no longer is collected in the system.Proposed andSection; 258.31(a)(3) would require the owner or operator toconduct ground-water monitoring during the first 30-year post-closure careperiod in accordance with the requirements in andSection; 258.50 and maintainthe ground-water monitoring system. The fundamental purpose of monitoringduring the post-closure care period is to detect ground-water contaminationin a timely fashion should the waste containment structures fail and totrigger corrective action as soon as contamination occurs. Long-term monitoringis essential to detect releases due to design or operating errors (e.g.,tearing of liners or disposing of wastes that are incompatible with theliner) and routine deterioration of liner. Particularly for landfills designedwith advanced containment systems (e.g., liners, leachate collection systems,or synthetic final caps), ground-water contamination may be delayed formany years, thus increasing the need for long-term monitoring. Becauseground-water monitoring wells are subject to routine deterioration, post-closureactivities also should include the periodic replacement of these wellsas needed.Finally, andSection; 258.31(a)(4) proposes to require the owner or operatorto monitor for methane in accordance with andSection; 258.23. That sectionrequires the owner or operator to ensure that methane generated by thelandfill unit does not accumulate in landfill structures (excluding gascontrol or recovery system components) in concentrations in excess of 25percent of the lower explosive limit for methane. The concentration ofmethane gas at the MSWLF facility property boundary also must not exceedthe LEL.Following completion of the first phase of post-closure care at each landfillunit, today's proposal would require the owner or operator to conduct asecond, less-intensive phase of care. The purpose of this second phaseis to ensure that a minimum level of care is continued to detect any releasethat might occur at an MSWLF in the long term, while at the same time minimizingthe burden on the owner or operator of continuing extensive post-closurecare activities for an extended period of time. Therefore, the Agency isproposing under andSection; 258.31(b) that the owner or operator must continue,at a minimum, ground-water monitoring and gas monitoring in order to detectany contamination that might occur beyond the first 30 years of post-closurecare. States would have the responsibility of specifying the duration ofthis second phase.The Agency is proposing this second phase of post-closure care for a numberof reasons. First, even the best liner and leachate collection systemswill ultimately fail due to natural deterioration, and recent improvementsin MSWLF containment technologies suggest that releases may be delayedby many decades at some landfills. For this reason, the Agency is concernedthat while corrective action may have already been triggered at many facilities,30 years may be insufficient to detect releases at other landfills. TheAgency, therefore, wants to ensure that any potential release will be detectedregardless of when it occurs. Finally, in the absence of sufficient datato follow the Agency to predict with certainty when containment systemsare likely to fail, a second phase of reduced post-closure care ensuresthat releases will be detected while minimizing costs to the regulatedcommunity.The Agency is proposing minimum requirements for this second phase of careto allow States maximum flexibility in tailoring the scope of the requirementsand the duration of this period to site-specific circumstances. For example,if a release is detected at an MSWLF during the second phase of care, theState may specify increased post-closure activities to be carried out asnecessary. For facilities located in vulnerable environmental settings,the State may wish to require the owner or operator to continue duringthis second phase of care many of the activities conducted during the firstphase. In addition, for vulnerable or high hazard settings, the Agencyexpects States to specify extended second-phase care periods. In thosecases in which corrective action is still underway at the end of the firstphase of post-closure care, the Agency expects States to require the secondphase of post-closure care to extend for the duration of the correctiveaction period, at a minimum.In addition to the minimum post-closure activities specified in today'sproposal, the Agency encourages States to specify more detailed post-closurecare requirements, such as maintaining the vegetative cover through periodicmowing, replanting, and regrading to preclude erosion that occurs naturallyover time and as a result of servere storms, and repairing the cap whennecessary to prevent the cap from becoming permeable. Other post-closurecare requirements could include security measures if access to the MSWLFfacility could pose a health hazard. In addition, the Agency encouragesthe States to specify deadlines for submitting monitoring data and otherrecordkeeping requirements to facilitate the detection of potential problemsat the site in a timely manner. The Agency requests comment on the appropriatenessof incorporating these and other post-closure care requirements.The types of post-closure care requirements proposed today closely parallelthose applicable to Subtitle C facilities. In addition, the post-closurecare activities proposed in today's rule are consistent with existing Statesolid waste management requirements based on the Agency's review of severalStates' solid waste regulations (Ref. 21). All of the State programs reviewedrequire, at a minimum, post-closure site maintenance, leachate control,and ground-water monitoring. In addition to these activities, many Statessurveyed require additional post-closure activities such as surface watermonitoring. The Agency in no way means to preclude States from requiringsuch activities.<T3>b. Length of Post-Closure Care Period. </T3>As noted above, the Agencyis proposing that, following closure of each MSWLF unit, the owner or operatormust conduct two phases of post-closure. In the first phase of post-closurecare, the owner or operator must conduct all of the post-closure care activitiesspecified under andpara; 258.31(a) for a minimum of 30 years. The State hasthe discretion to extend the period beyond 30 years. Subtitle C establishesa 30-year post-closure period and allows the Regional Administrator toeither reduce or extend the length of the period based on site-specificdemonstrations. As discussed above, the Agency is concerned that releasesmay not occur until after 30 years. In fact, the Agency currently is consideringextending the length of the post-closure care period well beyond 30 yearsfor hazardous waste facilities located in certain environments likely topose significant threats to human health and the environment. Therefore,today's rule proposes that the first phase of post-closure care must continuefor a minimum of 30 years, with the option for States to require a longerperiod if deemed appropriate. Section 258.31(b) proposes a second, less intensive phase of post-closurecare designed to ensure the detection of releases, but leaves to the Statesthe flexibility to specify the appropriate length of this period. Statesmay specify a standard period of care for all landfill units, or determinean appropriate period on a case-by-case basis (e.g., at the time the MSWLFis applying for a permit or within a specified period after the effectivedate of the regulations). While the first option would reduce the burdenon the States, the second option could allow for better protection againstreleases of hazardous constituents to the environment by adapting the post-closurecare period to site-specific circumstances.The Agency considered requiring an extended post-closure care period forMSWLFs with an option to reduce the period only if the owner or operatorcould demonstrate that a reduction in the period would not pose any threatto human health and the environment; however, the Agency was concernedthat this approach could be overly stringent and potentially burdensometo the owner or operator and to the State to establish the criteria forterminating the post-closure care period. The Agency also considered allowingthe State the discretion of reducing the 30-year post-closure care periodbased on cause, consistent with the Subtitle C requirement for hazardouswaste facilities. As discussed above, however, because improvements incontainment technology may delay the detection of releases, the Agencyis concerned that reducing the period to less than 30 years could resultin future releases not being detected. Finally, the Agency considered requiringperiods consistent with some of the State post-closure care periods (e.g.,5, 10, or 20 years). In the absence of empirical data from the States,however, the Agency is not convinced that these shorter periods are adequateto ensure the protection of human health and the environment.EPA is not proposing criteria and procedures for determining the lengthof the second phase of the post-closure care period although States areencouraged to do so. States may wish to consider several criteria whenevaluating the appropriate length of the second phase of the post-closureperiod. For instance, the liner and cover design, age, stability, and operatingrecord (including ground-water monitoring results that show changes inconstituent concentrations over time) of existing landfills are usefulfactors in estimating the potential for leachate and gas release. Otherfactors include leachate quality (e.g., volume and physical characteristics),hydrogeologic characteristics of the site, the potential for human exposure,and the expected future use of the facility and surrounding land. The Statealso may wish to list in the regulation the types of demonstrations thatowners or operators must make to terminate the post-closure care period.The Agency is requesting comments on the appropriate length of the post-closurecare period for MSWLFs. In particular, the Agency is requesting commentson the two-phased approach and information on the frequency and timingof releases from MSWLFs, criteria that should be used to evaluate the lengthof the post-closure care periods, appropriate demonstrations for terminatingthe post-closure care period, and other information based on experienceswith closed landfills.<T3>c. Post-Closure Plan. </T3>EPA is proposing in andSection; 258.31(c)to require the owner or operator of an MSWLF to prepare a written post-closureplan that includes descriptions of the monitoring and maintenance activitiesrequired in andSection; 258.31(a) and (b) for each MSWLF unit and the frequencywith which these activities will be performed during both phases of post-closurecare. The fundamental objective of monitoring is to ensure that any migrationof contaminants is detected in a timely fashion. In many instances, post-closuremonitoring will be a continuation of the monitoring activities conductedduring the landfill's active life. The description of maintenance activitiesnecessary to ensure the integrity of the waste containment systems shouldinclude routine maintenance that reasonably can be expected to be requiredafter closure of each unit (e.g., mowing, fertilization, erosion control,and rodent control) and the frequency with which these activities willbe performed. These monitoring and maintenance requirements are consistentwith State regulations examined by the Agency.EPA is proposing in andSection; 258.31(c)(2) that the post-closure plan alsoinclude the name, address, and telephone number of the person or officeto contact about the MSWLF during both phases of the post-closure careperiod. This requirement would ensure that, if emergency measures or long-termcorrective measures are necessary after closure, a person familiar withthe landfill design, the types of wastes handled, past operating problems,etc., will be available.The Agency also is proposing under andSection; 258.31(c)(3) that the post-closureplan include a description of the planned uses of the property during bothphases of the post-closure care period. One example of an acceptable useof a closed landfill would be a recreational park, provided the park complieswith the requirements of andSection; 258.31(c)(3). Under the proposed andSection;258.31(c)(3), the post-closure use of the property must not disturb theintegrity of the final cover, waste containment system, or function ofthe monitoring systems unless the State determines that the activities(1) will not increase the potential threat to human health or the environmentor (2) are necessary to reduce a threat to human health or the environment.For example, a foundation structure installed in a closed MSWLF may disturbthe integrity of the cap, present potential safety problems as result ofmigrating landfill gas, and result in structure failure. Interference withthe operation of the monitoring systems could prevent timely detectionof ground-water contamination or gas concentrations greater than the establishedhealth-based limit. Unmonitored access to the property after closure alsocould result in the release of hazardous constituents or actual exposureof buried wastes as a result of disturbances of the site. If an owner oroperator wishes to remove any wastes, waste residues, the liner, or contaminatedsoils at any time during the post-closure care period, it must obtain approvalfrom the State and demonstrate that disturbing the site will not increasethe threat to human health and the environment. These requirements areconsistent with the Subtitle C requirements for hazardous waste facilities.<T3>d. Post-Closure Plan Deadline and Approval.</T3> Consistent with theclosure plan requirements, the Agency is proposing to require under andSection;258.31(d) that the post-closure plan be prepared as of the effective dateof the rule or by the initial receipt of solid waste at the MSWLF, whicheveris later. This section also requires that the post-closure plan, and anysubsequent modification to the plan, be approved by the State. As describedabove, the Agency is leaving specific procedural requirements such as deadlinesand procedures for submitting, approving, and modifying post-closure careplans to the individual States. Finally, proposed andSection; 258.31(d) requiresthe owner or operator to maintain a copy of the most recent approved post-closureplan at the MSWLF facility or at some other location designated by theowner of operator. The plan must be maintained from the onset of the post-closurecare period until completion of the post-closure care period has been certifiedin accordance with andSection;  258.31(f) (see Section 12.f below) and theowner or operator has been notified by the State that it has been releasedfrom financial assurance for post-closure care for the entire landfillunder andSection; 258.32(g).<T3>e. Notation on the Deed to Property.</T3> The Agency is proposing inandSection; 258.31(e) that, following closure of the entire MSWLF, the owneror operator must record a notation on the deed or some other instrumentnormally examined during a title search that will notify any potentialpurchaser that: (1) The land has been used as an MSWLF and (2) its useis restricted under andSection; 258.31(c)(3). This notation on the deed isintended to assure that the land use is restricted in perpetuity. The owneror operator may ask permission to remove the notation on the deed if allwastes are removed in accordance with the provisions in andSection; 258.31(c)(3).Under the Subtitle C requirements for hazardous waste disposal facilities,an owner or operator must record a notice on the deed following closureof the first unit and after final closure to provide additional assurancethat all parties are aware of the use of the property. While today's proposedrule does not require that a notation to the deed by filed after closureof each landfill unit in order to minimize burdens on the owner or operator,States may wish to adopt this more stringent requirement.According to the Agency's survey of State requirements, some States alreadyhave procedures for ensuring that the post-closure use of landfill propertyis restricted. Some States require a notation to be put on the propertydeed; other States require that proposed future land use be subject toAgency review and approval.States may wish to specify additional notification requirements for MSWLFsas required under Subtitle C. For example, submission of a survey platindicating the location and dimension of landfill units, a record of wasteincluding the type, location, and quantity of waste disposed of in eachlandfill unit, and a certification that the deed notation has been recordedare all required under Subtitle C regulations.<T3>f. Post-Closure Care Certification.</T3> The Agency is proposing inandSection; 258.31(f) that following the completion of the second phase ofthe post-closure care period for each unit, the owner or operator submitto the State, a certification that both phases of post-closure care havebeen conducted in accordance with the approved post-closure plan. Consistentwith the closure certification, the post-closure care certification mustobjectively verify that post-closure care has been performed in accordancewith the post-closure care requirements based on a review of the landfillunit by a qualified party. As discussed above for closure certifications,the Agency is proposing to leave to the State the discretion to specifythe types of certfications that would provide such an objective assessment.Today's proposal requires that the certification be submitted at the completionof the second phase of the post-closure care period for each unit. Thisrequirement is consistent with these for hazardous waste facilities underSubtitle C. Because of the duration of the post-closure care period, theStates may wish to require periodic interim certifications (e.g., everyfive or 10 years or at the time of the permit renewal, if applicable) toconfirm that activities are being conducted properly. Alternatively, Statesmay wish to consider requiring a certification after the end of each ofthe two phases of post-closure care.<ITAG tagnum="81">13. Section 258.32 Financial Assurance Criteria</ITAG>Under today's proposed rule, the owner or operator of a new or existingMSWLF would be required to demonstrate financial assurance for the costsof conducting closure, post-closure care, and, if applicable, correctiveaction for known releases. (Under proposed andSection; 258.57, whenever theground-water protection standard is exceeded, an owner or operator mustconduct a corrective action program to treat in place or remove any AppendixII hazardous constituents exceeding the standard.) The purpose of financialassurance is to ensure that the owner or operator adequately plans forthe future costs of closure, post-closure care, and corrective action forknown releases, and to ensure that adequate funds will be available whenneeded to cover these costs if the owner or operator is unable or unwillingto do so. To demonstrate to the State that it has planned for future costs,the owner or operator must prepare written cost estimates. These cost estimateswould serve as the basis for determining the amount of financial assurancethat must be demonstrated. Today's proposed financial assurance requirements for closure, post-closurecare, and corrective action for known releases at MSWLFs are patternedafter the financial assurance provisions for hazardous waste facilitiesunder Subtitle C and proposed provisions for underground storage tanksunder Subtitle I. Financial assurance for closure and post-closure carefor MSWLFs is currently required in numerous States. Although financialassurance for corrective action is less frequently required by States,the Agency believes that provision of financial assurance to cover thecosts of corrective action for known releases is important to ensure thatfunds for long-term remedial activities are provided by the owner or operator.The Agency is not proposing at this time to require financial assurancefor other than known releases due to the complexity of the analysis thatwould be required to estimate probable corrective action costs associatedwith releases from MSWLFs. For example, to require a facility with a highprobability of a release to demonstrate financial assurance for correctiveaction costs in the event of a release would require a characterizationof the risks posed by a facility as well as the potential size, impact,and costs to remedy such releases. Such facility risk analyses could requireconsiderable time to complete and also could delay the adoption and implementationof regulations by States. The Agency requests comments on this decisionand information concerning how such cost estimates could be derived inthe event additional corrective action financial responsibility requirementsare proposed in the future.The Agency also considered requiring owners or operators of MSWLFs to demonstratefinancial assurance for third-party liability to compensate injured thirdparties. For a number of reasons, however, the Agency has decided to deferproposing such liability requirements at this time. First, the Agency isconcerned that it does not have sufficient data at this time to specifythe amount of liability coverage that would be appropriate for an MSWLF.Unlike Subtitle I, which mandates a minimum level of coverage for undergroundstorage tanks, the statute does not specify any minimum financial assurancerequirements for MSWLFs. To date, few claims data exist concerning third-partyawards resulting from releases at MSWLFs. While more data are availableto assess potential claims from Subtitle C facilities, the Agency is reluctantto extrapolate from these data or to adopt directly the levels of coveragerequired for Subtitle C facilities without further analysis comparing therisks and resultant third-party claims from MSWLFs and Subtitle C hazardouswaste facilities.Second, RCRA Section 4010(c) allows the Agency discretion to take intoaccount the practicable capability of MSWLFs when developing the new criteria.Today's proposal applies an extensive set of new regulations to a largeuniverse of waste facilities. Therefore, in light of the costs associatedwith implementing today's proposed requirements, the lack of availabledata on awards for third-party damages, and the current constraints inthe insurance market, the Agency has tentatively decided to defer any third-partyliability requirements. Instead, the Agency has chosen to focus on financialassurance requirements for costs of activities that are certain to be incurred(i.e., closure, post-closure care, and corrective action for known releases).In deferring these requirements, the Agency hopes to provide more timefor the liability insurance market to adjust to a new potential market.The Agency adopted a similar approach when promulgating liability coveragerequirements for Subtitle C requirements when it phased in the requirementsover a three-year period to allow the market to adjust to the demand forincreased capacity. Deferring third-party liability coverage requirements at the time, however,does not preclude the Agency from promulgating such a requirement for MSWLFsat a later date. Further, the Agency encourages States to consider requiringsuch coverage if they choose. This decision to defer these financial assurancerequirements in no way relieves an owner or operator of liability shouldinjury to third parties be shown to have resulted from the operation ofMSWLFs. The Agency requests comments on this decision to defer requirements forfinancial assurance for third-party liability costs at this time. In particular,the Agency requests information to assist in setting appropriate levelsof liability coverage for MSWLFs, including data on the number of claimsfiled, the size of settlements or awards resulting from injuries associatedwith releases from MSWLFs, the causes of such injuries, and the numberof persons harmed. Data concerning the nature, size, probability of, andpotential exposures to releases from MSWLFs could also be used in developingliability coverage requirements. EPA also requests information on the likelyavailability and cost of insurance coverage and other financial instrumentsfor liability coverage, the factors that might affect the cost and availabilitycoverage, the factors that might affect the cost and availability of financialassurance instruments, the potential burden on owners or operators of obtainingfinancial assurance, and the advisability of phasing in financial responsibilityrequirements for third-party liability as done under Subtitle C.Today's rule proposes that the amount of financial assurance for closure,post-closure care, and corrective action for known releases be based onsite-specific cost estimates. The Agency is not proposing in today's rulethe types of mechanisms that may be used to demonstrate financial assurance.Rather, today's proposal establishes a performance standard that specifiesa set of criteria that must be satisfied by any mechanism that is used.Regardless of the mechanism chosen, it must ensure that adequate fundsare available in a timely manner whenever they are needed. This approachprovides the regulatory community and the States the maximum flexibilityin satisfying the financial assurance requirements.<T3>a. Applicability.</T3> Today's proposal would apply to each owner andoperator of an MSWLF except for an owner or operator who is a State orFederal government entity. Although these proposed requirements would applyto both the MSWLF owner and the operator, only one would be required todemonstrate financial assurance for the MSWLF. This requirement is consistentwith those under Subtitles C and I. This option provides flexibility tothe regulated community by allowing them to choose which party will demonstratefinancial assurance while, at the same time, giving the State the additionalassurance that funds will be available by holding both parties ultimatelyresponsible. EPA considered, but rejected, the option of requiring boththe owner and operator to demonstrate financial assurance. While such anapproach might provide somewhat greater assurance that the costs of closure,post-closure care, and corrective action for known releases would be coveredin the event that one party failed to provide adequate funds, the Agencybelieves that, in most cases, this ``double'' coverage would be unnecessaryand would substantially increase the burden on owners and operators ofMSWLFs.EPA recognizes that because Federal and State government entities are permanentand stable institutions that exist to safeguard health and welfare, theyhave the requisite financial strength and incentives to cover the costsof closure, post-closure care, and corrective action for known releases.The Agency believes, therefore, that it is not necessary to impose financialassurance requirements on MSWLFs owned or operated by government entitieswhose debts and liabilities are the debts and liabilities of a State orthe United States. This exemption also extends to cases in which an MSWLFis owned by a State or Federal government entity and operated by a privateparty (or operated by a State or Federal government entity while ownedprivately). A State or Federal owner may, of course, require the privateoperator by contractual agreement to provide financial assurance. The exemptionfor MSWLFs owned or operated by Federal or State governments is consistentwith the approach adopted under both the Subtitle C regulations applicableto owners or operators of hazardous waste facilities and the proposed SubtitleI rules for underground storage tanks containing petroleum.The Agency also is considering whether to treat Indian Tribes, having Federallyrecognized governing bodies that carry out substantial governmental dutiesand powers over any area, as States. If so, they would be considered exemptfrom financial assurance requirements. If Indian Tribes are not exempt,they would be required to demonstrate financial assurance similar to localgovernments. The Agency requests comment on whether to exempt Indian Tribesfrom financial responsibility requirements. Specifically, the Agency requestsinformation on whether Indian Tribes have the requisite financial strengthand incentives to cover the costs of closure, post-closure, and correctiveaction for known releases. With regard to financial assurance requirements for local governments,EPA carefully considered whether to require municipal owners and operatorsof MSWLFs to demonstrate financial assurance for the costs of closure,post-closure care, and corrective action for known releases. While theAgency recognizes that many local governments, like Federal and State governments,are permanent entities and act to secure the well-being of their citizens,the Agency is concerned that local governments cannot provide the sameguarantee that they will be able to access adequate funds to pay for environmentalcosts in a timely manner.  EPA has determined that, relative to Federal and State government entities,local government entities generally: (1) Have more limited financial resourcesand less flexibility in their annual budgets, making reallocation of asubstantial amount of funds for a specific purpose in a given year extremelydifficult; (2) cannot necessarily access the traditional sources of municipalfinancing (i.e., intergovernmental transfers, bond issues, and taxes) quicklyenough to ensure funding in a timely manner; and (3) have been more proneto fiscal emergencies than Federal and State government entities. The Agencybelieves, therefore, that local government entities should be subject tofinancial assurance requirements as a tool to induce advanced planningfor the future environmental costs of closure, post-closure care, and correctiveaction for known releases. Moreover, the Agency believes that requiringlocal governments to demonstrate financial assurance may help them to raisefunds for these costs that they ultimately will have to cover.  <T3>b. Cost Estimates.</T3> EPA is proposing in andSection; 258.32 (b), (c),and (d) that the owner or operator of each MSWLF develop written site-specificestimates of the costs of conducting closure, post-closure care, and correctiveaction for known releases that would be used to determine the amount offinancial assurance required under andSection; 258.32 (f), (g), and (h).These cost estimates must account for the costs, in current dollars, ofa third party conducting the activities described in the closure and post-closureplans and in the corrective action program as specified in andSection;andSection;258.30, 258.31, and 258.58. The ``third party'' provision ensures thatadequate funds will be available for the State to hire a third party toconduct closure, post-closure care, and corrective action in the eventthat the owner or operator fails to fulfill these obligations. These requirementsparallel the requirements or proposed requirements under Subtitles C andI.  The closure cost estimate must be based on the cost of closing the MSWLFat the point in the landfill's active life when the extent and manner ofits operation would make closure (as described in the closure plan) themost expensive. For example, if an owner or operator operates the MSWLFon a cell-by-cell basis, the estimate should account for closing the maximumarea of the landfill ever open at any time.  The Agency is proposing that the owner or operator develop estimates ofthe costs of hiring a third party to conduct post-closure care activitiesfor each phase of the post-closure care period. The cost estimate for eachphase must be based directly on the activities described in the post-closurecare plan required under andSection; 258.31(c) and account for the entirelandfill. The estimate for each phase would be derived by multiplying theannual costs (in current dollars) of the activities by the number of yearsof care required in that phase. This approach is similar to the SubtitleC calculation of the post-closure care cost estimate, in which the costestimate is determined by multiplying the annual post-closure cost estimateby the number of years of post-closure care. Because not all post-closurecare activities are conducted on an annual basis (e.g., cap replacementor monitoring well replacement may only be required periodically), thetotal cost estimate must be adjusted to include these periodic costs aswell as the annual costs. To ensure that adequate funds would be availablefor the entire post-closure care period, the Agency is requiring that thepost-closure care cost estimates for each phase of post-closure care accountfor the most expensive costs of routine post-closure care. For example,the costs of monitoring during the first 30-year phase should account forthe most extensive monitoring likely to be required.  As noted above, Subpart E of today's rule proposes to require that wheneverthe ground-water protection level at the MSWLF is exceeded, an owner oroperator must conduct corrective action. Once a release has been detected,the owner or operator must prepare an estimate of the cost of the correctiveaction program, calculated by multiplying the annual costs of remedialactions and the number of years required to complete the corrective actionprogram.  The proposed rule would require the closure and post-closure cost estimatesto be adjusted annually for inflation until the entire landfill has beenclosed. The cost estimate for corrective action activities must be updatedfor inflation until the end of the corrective action period even if itextends beyond closure of the MSWLF. These requirements are consistentwith the Subtitle C requirements. Also consistent with Subtitle C requirements,today's proposal would not require the owner or operator to update thepost-closure cost estimate after the entire landfill has been closed; however,the Agency requests comment on the desirability of requiring annual adjustmentsof the post-closure cost estimate during the post-closure care period toprevent a significant shortfall in funds, which could result from not accountingfor future inflation.  The Agency suggests that the States require the use of inflation factorsthat are readily available to owners and operators (e.g., Implicit PriceDeflator for Gross National Product as published in the ``Survey of CurrentBusiness,'' a Department of Commerce publication) or specify other inflationfactors that must be used to adjust the estimates. States may wish to referto the provisions in 40 CFR 264.142 and 264.144 and the accompanying guidancematerials in developing these requirements.  In addition to updating estimates for inflation, today's proposed rulealso would require that the owner or operator increase the closure andpost-closure cost estimates when changes to the plans or changes at thefacility during the active life increase the cost estimates (e.g., increasein design capacity, increase in the maximum area open, more extensive monitoringrequirements). Similarly, today's rule proposes that an owner or operatormust increase the corrective action cost estimate anytime a change in thecorrective action program or in the facility conditions increases the costestimate.  Whenever the cost estimates are increased, the owner or operator must increasethe level of financial assurance required under andSection; 258.32 (f), (g)and (h). If the owner or operator can demonstrate that changes in the facilityresult in a decrease in the maximum costs of closure over the active lifeof the landfill (e.g., reduction in size of the area to be used for thelandfill), the owner or operator may submit a request to the State to reducethe closure cost estimate. The owner or operator may request a reductionin the amount of the post-closure care cost estimate if the owner or operatorcan demonstrate that the cost estimate exceeds the maximum cost of post-closurecare over the remaining post-closure care period. Because the proposedrule would not require the post-closure cost estimate to be adjusted forinflation during the post-closure care period, the State should accountfor future inflation in determining if the estimate exceeds the remainingcosts to be incurred over the length of the period. Because the correctiveaction cost estimate is adjusted for inflation until the completion ofthe program, the owner or operator may more easily be able to demonstratethat the original estimate exceeds the remaining costs to be incurred. The Agency is not proposing procedures or deadlines for estimating andadjusting cost estimates. However, the Agency encourages States to do soand refers them to the Subtitle C provisions in 40 CFR 264.142 and 264.144for guidance. In addition, the Agency strongly encourages States to considercarefully all requests for reductions in cost estimates to ensure thatshortfalls in coverage do not result. The Agency asks for comments on whetherthe revised Criteria should include procedures or deadlines for estimatingand adjusting cost estimates.  For recordkeeping purposes, the owner or operator must maintain copiesof the most recent cost estimates for closure, post-closure care, and correctiveaction for known releases at the landfill unit until the owner or operatorhas been released from financial assurance for that activity under andSection;258.32 (f), (g), and (h). These provisions are consistent with requirementsunder Subtitle C.  <T3>c. Performance Standard for Financial Assurance.</T3> In order to minimizethe number of specific procedural requirements applicable to demonstratingfinancial assurance and provide maximum flexibility to the States, theAgency is not specifying in the proposed regulation the types of financialassurance mechanisms that would be allowable; however, the Agency is concernedthat the mechanisms allowed by the States (e.g., trust funds, letters ofcredit, State fund) satisfy the overall ojbectives of financial assurance,i.e., to ensure that adequate funds are readily available to cover thecosts of conducting closure, post-closure care, and corrective action forknown releases if the owner or operator fails to do so. Therefore, theAgency is proposing in andSection; 258.32(e) of today's rule a performancestandard for financial assurance that must be satisfied to demonstratefinancial assurance under andSection; 258.32 (f), (g), and (h).Under the performance standard, financial assurance mechanisms allowedby a State must: (1) Ensure that the amount of funds assured is sufficientto cover the costs of closure, post-closure care, and corrective actionfor known releases when needed; (2) ensure that funds will be availablein a timely fashion when needed; (3) guarantee the availability of therequired amount of coverage from the effective date of these requirementsor prior to the initial receipt of solid waste, whichever is later, untilthe owner or operator is released from financial assurance requirementsunder andSection; 253.32(f), (g), and (h); (4) provide flexibility to theowner or operator; and (5) be legally valid and binding and enforceableunder State and Federal law.The financial assurance mechanisms authorized under Subtitle C and proposedunder Subtitle I, if properly drafted, satisfy these performance criteria.Subtitle C allows the use of a trust fund, letter of credit, surety bond,insurance, financial test, corporate guarantee, State-required mechanism,State assumption of responsibility, or a combination of certain mechanismsto demonstrate financial assurance for closure and post-closure. (Insurancewas not proposed for corrective action financial assurance under SubtitleC because the Agency determined that it would not be available.) The proposedSubtitle I regulations (52 FR 12766, April 17, 1987) allow a similar setof instruments to demonstrate financial assurance for corrective actionand liability coverage. States may wish to refer to the background documentfor closure and post-closure care and financial responsibility (Ref. 4)for more information on the use of these mechanisms in other EPA financialassurance programs and guidance on how these mechanisms could be structuredto satisfy the performance standard discussed below.The financial assurance performance standard in today's proposal wouldrequire States to adopt a program under which the selected range of financialassurance mechanisms ensures that sufficient funds will be available tocover the costs of conducting closure, post-closure care, and correctiveaction for known releases whenever such funds are needed. In most cases,the amount of funds assured should equal the full amount of the currentsite-specific cost estimates for closure, post-closure care, and correctiveaction at the time the mechanism is established. For example, if a letterof credit issued by a bank is an allowable mechanism, its face value mustequal the site-specific cost estimate. To minimize the burdens on smallowners or operators who may have to set aside funds in a trust to demonstratefinancial assurance, States may wish to adopt the approach used under SubtitleC. Under Subtitle C, an owner or operator is allowed to build up the trustfund over the life of the facility or over 20 years (10 years for permittedfacilities), whichever is shorter. To meet the performance standard criteriaunder today's proposal, if a build-up period is allowed for trust funds,the State must require the trust to be fully funded no later than the endof the landfill's active life. States may wish to adopt stricter trustfund requirements (e.g., shorter build-up period, accelerated paymentsinto the trust in the earlier years of operations) to avoid potential shortfallsif the MSWLF is closed earlier than expected. If a State chooses to developa State fund to be used for the costs of closure, post-closure care, andcorrective action for known releases, the size of the fund must be commensuratewith the expected costs likely to be incurred to satisfy the performancestandard.To ensure that funds will be available when needed, States also may needto take into account potential legal and political constraints on accessingfunds guaranteed by financial mechanisms. For example, because the U.S.EPA Regional Administrator does not have the authority to directly receivefunds from third-party financial assurance mechanisms (i.e., all moniesreceived must be directed to the U.S. Treasury), under Subtitle C a standbytrust fund must be established when certain instruments are used (e.g.,letter of credit and surety bond) to serve as a depository for the fundsif the Regional Administrator draws on the instrument. Some States mayface similar constraints in accepting funds directly from third partiesand may need to establish standby trust fund requirements for certain mechanisms(e.g., letters of credit) to ensure that the State has access to the fundswhenever they are needed.Because of the long period between the initial establishment of the financialassurance mechanism and the time that the costs are incurred, the performancestandard requires that the mechanisms guarantee continued availabilityof coverage until the owner or operator establishes an alternate financialassurance mechanism or is released from financial assurance requirementsto avoid potential gaps in coverage. To ensure reliability over time, Statesshould establish provisions that address contingencies such as (1) bankruptcyor incapacity of the financial assurance provider or the landfill owneror operator and (2) cancellation or termination of mechanisms by the provider.To prevent gaps in coverage in the event of these contingencies, Statesmust ensure that owners or operators establish alternate financial mechanismsin a timely manner. For example, States could require that only after obtainingalternate assurance could the present mechanism be cancelled or terminated.States also could specify notification requirements and time limits forproviding alternate financial assurance, similar to provisions under SubtitleC. Furthermore, States may wish to adopt provisions similar to SubtitleC regulations that require certain mechanisms to be automatically renewedunless an alternate financial assurance mechanism has been established,or else the third party offering the instrument becomes liable for theobligation. Finally, States must ensure that owners or operators of MSWLFscannot terminate financial assurance at will, which could jeopardize theavailability of funds when necessary. For example, Subtitle C requiresthat financial assurance cannot be terminated until after the certificationsof closure or post-closure care have been received and approved.In authorizing financial assurance mechanisms for demonstrating financialassurance, States should provide a range of mechanisms to provide ownersor operators of MSWLFs with flexibility for demonstrating compliance whileat the same time ensuring that they meet the regulatory requirements. Forexample, the Agency would not consider a program sufficiently flexibleif that program restricted owners or operators to using only a financialtest or insurance because such restrictions would likely impose a significantburden on much of the regulated community.Finally, under the performance standard, the financial assurance mechanismsmust be legally valid and binding. The validity of such mechanisms willlargely be a matter of State law. However, to be legally valid, a financialassurance mechanism must be issued by an institution that has the legalauthority to issue the mechanism and that is legally acceptable and/orregulated by a Federal or State agency. Financial assurance mechanismsalso must be enforceable under State and Federal law. To help ensure thatthe mechanisms are enforceable, States may wish to specify wording forthe mechanisms consistent with the regulations found in 40 CR 264.151.These mechanisms are discussed in a background document to this proposedrule (Ref. 4).In proposing a financial assurance performance standard rather than specificfinancial assurance mechanisms, the Agency has sought to minimize inconsistencieswith the approximately 20 States that already have financial assurancerequirements for MSWLFs. The Agency recently conducted case studies ofnine such programs (Ref. 19). The study found considerable variation amongState programs both in the types of mechanisms allowed and in the proceduralrequirements for the financial assurance mechanisms. For additional detailon the results of the case studies, see the financial assurance backgrounddocument to this rulemaking (Ref. 19). Today's proposal is, therefore,designed to accommodate the variations among existing State programs, whileensuring that all programs meet the performance standard for financialassurance. The Agency requests comments on the proposed financial assuranceperformance standard, including the use of this standard rather than identifyinga list of acceptable financial assurance mechanisms.<T3>d. Financial Assurance Provisions for Local Governments. </T3>As notedin the previous section, the Agency is not proposing specific financialmechanisms in today's rule in order to provide maximum flexibility to theStates. The Agency believes that the Subtitle C provisions can be usedas models for States in developing their rules. Unlike Subtitle C, however,the majority of MSWLFs are owned by local governments. While Subtitle Callows a financial test to be used to demonstrate financial assurance,the test in 40 CFR 264.143 and 264.145 is designed primarily for corporatefirms and is not directly applicable to local governments. Therefore, becauseof the large number of MSWLFs owned by local governments, the Agency consideredfor today's rule the feasibility of developing a financial test that wouldexempt local governments able to pass the test from having to obtain athird-party financial assurance mechanism (or contribute to a State Fund,if applicable).A financial test designed specifically for local governments was consideredduring the development of the Subtitle C regulations but was not includeddue to difficulties in interpreting and verifying municipal accountinginformation, concern over the use of bond ratings as a measure of fiscalstrength, and concern over the accessibility of allocated tax revenues.However, since the promulgation of the Subtitle C requirements, many localgovernments have developed more sophisticated financial management practices.Because of these changes, the Agency is examining possible approaches aState might use in developing such a test specifically for lcoal governments.For example, the Agency is examining the feasibility of developing a specialtest that takes into account fiscal, institutional, and other factors.Although the Agency is not proposing a financial test for local governmentsin today's rule, the financial assurance background document discussesa framework that States may wish to use in specifying criteria for a financialtest for local governments (Ref. 4). If a State decides to allow a financialtest for local governments, the framework should be useful in choosingappropriate measures of a local government's financial strength.The Agency requests comments on the use of a financial test for local governments.Specifically, EPA requests information on standards that might be usedto measure a local government's financial strength, the measures that mightbe taken to establish such a financial test, and whether any States currentlyallow a financial test for local governments.<T3>e. Financial Assurance Requirements. </T3>As noted in Sections 13.band c, site-specific cost estimates are used to determine the amount offinancial assurance required. The mechanisms used to demonstrate this amountof coverage must satisfy the performance standard specified in andSection;258.32(e).The amount of closure financial assurance must be based directly on themost recent closure cost estimate adjusted for inflation in accordancewith andSection; 258.32(b). Financial assurance for post-closure care mustcover the costs of conducting both phases of the post-closure care periodfor the entire landfill. The amount of financial responsibility requiredfor each phase of post-closure care is calculated by multiplying the mostrecent annual post-closure cost estimate for each phase of post-closurecare by the number of years in that phase. The sum of these two estimatesis the amount of financial assurance required for post-closure care. Thisapproach is similar to the Subtitle C calculation of the post-closure carecost estimate, in which the cost estimate is determined by multiplyingthe annual post-closure cost estimate by the number of years of post-closurecare.EPA is proposing in andSection; 258.32(h) to require corrective action financialassurance for known releases in an amount equal to the most recent annualcorrective action cost estimate in andSection; 258.32(d) times the numberof years required to complete the corrective action program. The Agencyis proposing that financial assurance for corrective action be demonstratedafter the cost estimate has been prepared in accordance with andSection;258.32(d), consistent with Subtitle C. Before adopting this timing requirement,the Agency considered the feasibility of requiring some minimal level offinancial responsibility for corrective action as soon as the need forcorrective action was demonstrated but before the corrective action measuresand costs were determined. This latter approach has been proposed for SubtitleI because the statute requires financial assurance for corrective actionfor a specified amount ($1 million) before there is any known contamination.The Agency concluded, however, that it still does not have the data sufficientto estimate the cost of corrective action in advance and is delaying therequirement until a release has been detected and the estimates of costshave been developed. States may wish to require some level of financialassurance to cover the costs of interim measures that may be taken priorto the completion of the corrective action plan and the approved cost estimate.Release from financial assurance requirements for closure, post-closurecare, and corrective action is triggered by State approval of the certificationssubmitted to the State under andSection;andSection; 258.30(e), 258.31(f), and258.32(h). Following the receipt of the certification from the owner oroperator that verifies that closure, post-closure care, or corrective actionhave been completed in accordance with the approved plans, today's ruleproposes in andSection; 258.32 (f), (g), and (h) that the State notify theowner or operator in writing that he no longer is required to demonstratefinancial responsibility for these activities. If the State has reasonto believe that the activities have not been conducted in accordance withthe approved plan, it must notify the owner or operator and include a detailedstatement of reasons for not releasing the owner or operator from the financialassurance requirements.D. Subpart D_Design Criteria<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Overview of Proposed Standards</ITAG><T3>a. New Units. </T3>Section 258.40(a) of today's proposal would requirethat new MSWLF units be designed with liner systems, LCS, and final coversystems as necessary to meet the design goal in the aquifer at the wastemanagement unit boundary or an alternative boundary specified by the State.The two key components of this performance standard are the design goal,which is a human health- and environmental-based ground-water risk level,and the point of compliance (POC) in the aquifer (i.e., the waste managementunit boundary or an alternative boundary specified by the State). Today'sproposal provides States considerable flexibility in establishing bothof these key components. As discussed below, the State establishes thedesign goal within the protective risk range and also may set an alternativeboundary as the point of compliance; however, this boundary shall not exceed150 meters from the waste management unit and shall be located on landowned by the owner or operator of the MSWLF.In this proposal the Agency is considering three alternative risk ranges.These are 1andmultiply;10^4 to 1andmultiply;10^7 , a fixed level of 1andmultiply;10^5,or an upper bound risk level of 1andmultiply;10^4 (with States having discretionto be more stringent). EPA is proposing to use the range of 1andmultiply;10^4to 1andmultiply;10^7 because the Agency currently uses this range in clean-upactivities at sites and because this will provide a margin for considerationof site specific factors in setting the risk level. A fixed risk levelof 1andmultiply;10^5 would provide a uniform level of protection across allStates. On the other hand, setting an upper bond risk level of 1andmultiply;10^4would allow States greater flexibility in establishing more stringent risklevels based on site specific conditions.In its regulatory actions EPA generally uses a case-by-case approach, dependingon the surrounding issues, uncertainties, and information bases. Such acase-by-case approach allows flexibility in judging the variety of factorsand uncertainties included in the risk assessments. For example, the followingrisk levels have been embraced by EPA since 1984:andbullet; The Superfund Clean-up policy_10^4 to 10^7.andbullet; Alternate Concentration Limits (ACLs)_10^4 to 10^7 with 10^6 target.andbullet; Drinking water standards/Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL)_10^4to 10^6.andbullet; Pesticides in groundwater strategy_10^6 trigger.andbullet; National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPS)_10^2to 10^6.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The Agency intends to examine closely the nature of the Subtitle Duniverse while keeping in mind the capability of State programs and feasibilityof achieving lower risks. The Agency requests comment on these alternatives.The design goal is an overall ground-water carcinogenic risk level thatmust be established by the State. At a minimum, the goal must lie withinthe protective risk range; however, the States would, under any option,have the discretion to select a risk level that is more protective thanthe proposal. The focus for the design goal is on carcinogenic risk. Resultsof EPA's Subtitle D risk model indicate that carcinogens drive the risksposed by releases to ground water by MSWLFs. Non-carcinogens, along withcarcinogens, will be addressed by the ground-water monitoring and correctiveaction programs.The design goal is consistent with the requirements proposed today fordetermining the ground-water trigger levels (see proposed 258.52) and theground-water protection standards (GWPSs) (see proposed 258.57(e)). However,unlike the trigger levels and the GWPSs, the design goal is not constituent-specific.Rather, the design goal represents the overall ground-water risk level(i.e., the combined risk from all constituents) that the State believesis necessary to protect human health and the environment.The possible use of the risk range for a design goal is meant to give theStates the flexibility to consider the practicable capability of the owneror operator in establishing design requirements.The design goal (in conjunction with the point of compliance) is used todetermine what design is necessary for the facility. For example, if 1andmultiply;10^5were chosen by the State as the design goal, the facility must be designedto prevent releases to the ground water that would cause the overall riskposed by the ground water to exceed 1andmultiply;10^5 at the waste managementunit boundary or alternative State-specified boundary.Section 258.40(d) specifies that the State could establish an alternativeboundary as the compliance point for a new unit; however, this alternativeboundary cannot go beyond the 150 meters from the waste management unitboundary and must be on land owned by the owner or operator of the MSWLF.The State must consider at least the following factors in establishingthis alternative boundary: (1) The hydrogeologic characteristics of thefacility and surrounding land; (2) volume and physical and chemical characteristicsof the leachate; (3) the quantity, quality, and direction of ground-waterflow; (4) the proximity and withdrawal rate of the ground-water users;(5) availability of alternative drinking water supplies; (6) the existingquality of the ground water, including other sources of contamination andtheir cumulative impacts on the ground water; and (7) public health, safety,and welfare effects. EPA's intent in allowing States to establish alternativeboundaries is to allow site-specific characteristics to be considered inmeeting the design goal. For example, the State may wish to set an alternativeboundary in situations where the aquifer is of low quality and has littleor no potential for future use.In considering the various factors specified in andSection; 258.40(d) forestablishing this alternative boundary, States will determine which factorsare the most important at each facility and are provided the flexibilityto use a different ranking system at each facility. The consideration ofthese site-specific factors should ensure that establishing the alternativeboundary would not result in contamination of ground water needed or usedfor human consumption that would result in adverse impacts on human healthor the environment. Such adverse impacts include contamination of drinkingwater supplies, degradation of sensitive ecosystems, or degradation ofrecreational areas.EPA considered setting the maximum alternative boundary at the propertyboundary without a distance limit. However, under such an approach, greatexpanses of ground water could be contaminated before detection. EPA believesthat this practice would, in effect, circumvent the intent of today's proposal.EPA chose a distance of 150 meters as the maximum alternative boundaryto allow for consideration of the practicable capability of owners andoperators and to allow for greater State flexibility in setting designrequirements. The 150-meter limit also is expected to have minimum impacton existing facilities. The 150-meter value represents the third quartile(75th percentile) from the distribution of distances between the unit andproperty boundary for MSWLFs determined from EPA's facility survey results(Ref. 30). EPA also is proposing to require that the alternative boundarybe located on land owned by the owner or operator of the MSWLF to preventcontamination of ground water off-site.The consequence of giving States the flexibility to use a POC at a distancegreater than the unit boundary is that it allows contaminant concentrationsto diminish (due to degradation, dispersion, and attenuation) over distanceand, thus, potentially decrease the stringency of design criteria neededto meet the design goal. In this manner, the alternative boundary providesStates the opportunity to take into account the practicable capabilityof the facility owners or operators. For example, EPA estimates (basedon risk modeling described later) that the percentage of new MSWLFs exceedinga 1andmultiply;10^5 risk level drops from 43 percent at the unit boundaryto 23 percent at 150 meters.For the above reasons, EPA believes the 150-meter maximum alternative POCallows for consideration of the practicable capability of the regulatedcommunity and State flexibility in setting design criteria while ensuringprotection of human health and the environment. The Agency requests commentspecifically on the use of this distance to establish an alternative boundary.In implementing today's proposed performance standard under andSection; 258.40(a),States have two options. Under the first option, the State may establisha performance standard (including the design goal and point of compliancewithin the limits prescribed in andSection; 258.40(a)) for each facilityon a case-by-case basis. For example, after considering site-specific factors,the State may set a performance standard for one MSWLF that specifies adesign goal of 1andmultiply;10^5 risk to be met at the waste management unitboundary, while at another MSWLF, the State may require a design goal of1andmultiply;10^6 to be met at an alternative boundary. In setting this alternativeboundary, the State must fully consider the factors specified in andSection;258.40(d).Under the second option, a State may establish one performance standard(including the design goal and point of compliance) that applies to allMSWLFs in the State. For example, the State may elect to establish a performancestandard that requires all new MSWLFs in the State to be designed to meeta risk level of 1andmultiply;10^6 at the waste management unit boundary.If a State wishes to incorporate an alternative boundary (i.e., other thanthe waste management unit) into its State-wide performance standard, theState must carefully consider all the facility-specific factors requiredunder andSection; 258.40(d). The Agency believes that this method may bedifficult in States that have a large number of MSWLFs.Regardless of whether the performance standard is set on a site-specificbasis or a State-wide basis, the State must still determine MSWLF designsthat meet the performance standard. Section 258.40(d) requires the Stateto consider at least the following factors in determining the specificdesign necessary to meet the performance standard: (1) The hydrogeologiccharacteristics of the facility and surrounding land, (2) the climaticfactors of the area, (3) the volume and physical characteristics of theleachate, (4) proximity of ground-water users, and (5) ground-water quality.Various methods for considering these factors and determining appropriatedesigns are discussed later in this preamble (see Part 5 of this section).In certain cases, the State may find that MSWLF designs required underits existing regulations adequately meet a State-wide performance standardestablished in accordance with Subpart D of today's proposal. In such cases,the State may use its existing regulations to implement today's proposedrequirements for new MSWLF design. The Agency specifically requests commentson the approach to State implementation of today's proposed andSection; 258.40(a)performance standard.<T3>b. Existing Units. </T3>The Agency is proposing a different performancestandard for existing units than for new units. For existing units, andSection;258.40(e) of today's proposal would require installation of a final coversystem that prevents infiltration of liquids through the cover and intothe waste. In proposing a different standard for existing units, the Agencyis taking into account the practicable capability of owners and operatorsof MSWLFs. EPA recognizes that most existing units have not been specificallydesigned to meet the design goal at the waste management unit boundary.However, some States have design and performance requirements for MSWLFsthat, if properly implemented, may have resulted in landfill designs thatare capable of meeting the design goal for new units. Further, MSWLFs constructedafter the promulgation of the 1979 Criteria (40 CFR Part 257) should havebeen designed and operated to ensure that the concentration of contaminantsintroduced to the ground water did not exceed the MCLs specified in thePart 257.EPA believes that to require existing units to meet the same performancestandard as new units would seriously strain the resources of the regulatedcommunity. First, the data necessary to make the determination of whetherthe existing unit meets the design goal, such as the geology beneath theunit or the original design specifications, may not be readily availableor may be very costly to obtain. This lack of information was evident inseveral of the case studies EPA reviewed in developing of this proposal.Second, if the design of the existing unit was determined to be incapableof meeting the design goal, retrofitting would be necessary. The Agencybelieves retrofitting for Subtitle D facilities should not be requiredbecause (1) the procedure is impractical because it requires the excavationand temporary storage or disposal of wastes, (2) the excavation of thewaste may create its own set of public health problems (e.g., dangers toworkers, contaminated run-off), and (3) such retrofitting would disruptexisting solid waste management activities. Retrofitting may be particularlydisruptive if a large number of existing facilities are found to be unableto meet the design goal.The final cover requirement for existing units could be met by a wide rangeof designs based on site-specific conditions. These designs range froma cap consisting of soils with adequate moisture-holding capacity, plantedwith the proper vegetative cover to handle the wettest month at this locationand sloped to maximize surface run-off without causing significant erosionproblems, to a cap containing a hydraulic barrier, such as a flexible membraneliner to prevent infiltration into the waste.As with new units, many factors are involved in designing the final cover.These include precipitation, potential and actual evapotranspiration soilmoisture holding capacity, vegetation, and run-off. There are several methodologiesavailable that use these factors to estimate the amount of infiltrationthat may enter the waste. These methods are discussed in the backgrounddocuments that support today's rule (Ref. 5).<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Rationale for Proposed Approach</ITAG>The primary goals of this rule are to establish standards that are protectiveof human health and the environment, provide flexibility to the States,and minimize disruption of current solid waste management practices byconsidering the practicable capability of the regulated community. TheAgency believes that a performance standard approach for the design ofMSWLF units best ensures that these goals can be achieved.Today's proposed requirements would allow the owner or operator to takeinto account site-specific conditions when designing the unit to ensurethat the concentration of contaminants at a specified compliance point(e.g., the waste management unit boundary) meets the design goal. Furthermore,use of a performance standard allows for the consideration of innovativetechnologies that may be developed in the future.Today's performance standard would also provide States the flexibilityto make the final decision as to how the standard would be achieved. ManyStates currently have standards that utilize a performance standard approachfor design of MSWLFs and strongly support the performance standard approachproposed today. The Agency believes that, in many cases, only minor modificationsto existing State standards would be necessary to make them consistentwith today's proposal. Therefore, EPA believes that the proposed standardallows consideration of practicable capability and will result in minimaldisruption to State programs. A review of current State regulations isincluded in background documents supporting this proposal (Ref. 9).<T3>a. Differences from Existing Part 257 Criteria. </T3>Today's proposedstandard for MSWLFs is similar to the current requirements under 40 CFR257.3-4, which prohibits Subtitle D facilities from contaminating groundwater beyond the solid waste boundary or an alternative boundary specifiedby the State. There are, however, several major differences in today'sproposal.First, today's proposal specifically would require the owner or operatorto design new units to meet a protective ground water risk level. (Seediscussion in Section IX.D.1.a. of today's preamble concerning the designgoal and EPA's request for comment on alternative risk ranges.) Under theexisting Criteria, if a facility contaminates the ground water, the facilityis classified as an ``open dump'' and must be upgraded or closed undera State-approved compliance schedule. Today's proposal, by establishinga design goal tied to ground-water protection, is intended to be preventiverather than reactive.Second, the proposed design goal is an overall risk level that encompassesrisks from a comprehensive set of constituents (i.e., Appendix II), whichform the basis of the ground-water protection standard. The standard forthe existing Criteria is limited to the contaminants identified in theNational Interim Primary Drinking Water Regulations (NIPDWRs), now NationalPrimary Drinking Water Regulations (NPDWRs). The Agency recognized in thepreamble when it promulgated the existing Part 257 Criteria that this listdid not serve as a comprehensive ground-water quality standard becauseit did not include all potentially harmful substances that might be associatedwith leachate from solid waste. Today's proposal requires that an overallrisk level (i.e., design goal) be selected and used in new unit designand that, during ground-water monitoring, a more comprehensive list ofconstituents (i.e., more comprehensive than the existing Part 257 Criteria)be used to ensure that the design goal is being met. This list includesmany constituents that may be found in landfill leachate, thereby providingmore protection to human health and the environment than the existing Criteria.This proposal is discussed in greater detail in Section IX.E of today'spreamble.Third, EPA is proposing to establish a maximum limit on the distance thealternative boundary may be from the waste management unit boundary. Underthe original Criteria, the maximum limit for the alternative boundary wasleft to the State's discretion. The Agency has chosen to propose a limitof 150 meters from the unit boundary in establishing the alternative boundary.The site-specific factors to be used in establishing an alternative boundarythat were identified in the original Criteria, however, have been maintained.Fourth, today's action proposes ground-water monitoring and correctiveaction requirements for both new and existing municipal waste landfills.The monitoring requirements would allow continuous evaluation of whetherfacilities are complying with the design goal, while the corrective actionrequirements ensure that appropriate responses are taken to protect publichealth from exposure to contaminated ground water and minimize resourcedamage.Finally, today's action proposes different design standards for new andexisting MSWLF units, unlike the original Criteria, which established onedesign standard for both types of units. EPA made this decision for thereasons discussed earlier (e.g., practicable capability); however, whenthis different standard for existing units is considered in context withother requirements of the proposal (e.g., corrective action), the overallprotection is the same.<T3>b. Differences From Subtitle C Standard. </T3>There are two major differencesbetween the current Subtitle C standards for hazardous waste landfillsand today's proposal. First, the overall performance standard for the designof hazardous waste landfills is more stringent than the performance standardfor MSWLFs. Subtitle C landfills must be designed to prevent hazardouswaste or hazardous constituents from entering the surrounding soils andground water. The proposed performance standard for MSWLFs, which wouldrequire that the design goal not be exceeded at the compliance point, allowsthe mitigating effects of the surrounding soils and aquifer material toreduce the concentrations of contaminants. The Agency believes today'sstandard is appropriate for MSWLFs because it allows for considerationof the practicable capability of the regulated community.The second major difference between toady's proposal and the current SubtitleC standards is the strict Subtitle C design standard. Although there arecertain very stringent variances available, location characteristics (e.g.,climate and hydrogeology) generally do not reduce the design requirementsfor Subtitle C facilities as they do under the Subtitle D proposal. Therefore,Subtitle C specifies one design (i.e., double liners, LCSs, and leak detectionsystems) for almost all locations, while the proposed Subtitle D performancestandard would allow location characteristics to be considered when designingthe MSWLF unit so that the location and design of the unit complement eachother. This proposed standard would allow consideration of the practicablecapability of the owner or operator.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Alternatives Considered</ITAG>The Agency considered a number of alternatives to the design requirementsproposed today. Various performance standards, uniform design standards(with and without variance provisions), location categories approach, andrisk-based approach were considered in developing today's design requirements.The Agency requests comments on all the alternatives presented below. EPAspecifically is interested in comments on the advantages and disadvantagesof the alternatives in relation to today's proposed approach.<T3>a. Other Performance Standards. </T3>EPA considered two alternativeperformance standards to those contained in today's proposal: (1) RequireMSWLFs to be designed to meet the design goal at the unit boundary butmake no allowance for an alternative boundary and (2) require MSWLFs tobe designed to meet the design goal at the unit boundary or any alternativeboundary specified by the State (current standard in 40 CFR Part 257).These alternatives were evaluated based on the potential extent of ground-watercontamination that may result, ability to enforce the standard throughcitizen suits, the practicable capability for the regulated community tocomply, and flexibility afforded the States.The first alternative, requiring MSWLFs to meet the design goal at theunit boundary, would provide the greatest protection to ground water because,by strictly defining the point of compliance as the unit boundary withno alternative allowed, it limits the real extent of ground-water contamination.This alternative could be enforced easily through citizen suits; however,this option does not allow consideration of the practicable capabilitiesof the regulated community and could limit State flexibility by not allowingStates to consider site-specific conditions when determining the pointof compliance. Further, by not allowing consideration of site-specificconditions, this alternative could result in over-regulation and couldexceed the practicable capability of the regulated community to comply.The second alternative, requiring MSWLFs to meet the design goal at theunit boundary or a State-selected alternative, would provide more flexibilityto account for the practical capability of the regulated community. Itwould be less burdensome to the regulated community because site-specificfactors could be considered, thereby avoiding over-regulation and increasedcosts; however, it would be less protective of ground water because itwould allow for a greater area extent of ground water to be contaminatedthan the first alternative. This alternative also could be difficult toenforce through citizen suits because no one alternative boundary wouldbe specified in the rule for all MSWLFs.The Agency believes that today's proposal provides a balance of the positiveaspects of the above alternatives. It limits the potential area extentof ground-water contamination by placing a distance cap on the alternativeboundary. In addition, it provides State flexibility, minimizes the potentialfor over-regulation, and considers the practicable capability of the regulatedcommunity. Finally, it would be enforceable at the Federal level or throughcitizen suits because it would set limits at the point of compliance.<T3>b. Uniform Design Standards. </T3>The Agency also considered establishinguniform design standards for MSWLFs. Under this approach, requirementsfor liners, LCSs, and final cover systems would have been delineated inthe regulation and would have been the same for all units. This approachis the same as that used in the Subtitle C regulations. This approach cansimplify permitting because the same specific design requirement appliesto all units regardless of site-specific differences. The Agency rejectedthis type of standard for MSWLFs because it would not consider site-specificlocation factors nor the practicable capability of the regulated communityto comply, resulting in possible over-regulation in some areas. Further,it would severely limit State flexibility.The Agency also considered uniform design standards with variances to allowvariation of designs based on site-specific factors. In particular, theAgency considered proposing for all new MSWLFs composite liner and leachatecollection system requirements similar to those proposed today only forthose MSWLFs that recirculate leachate or gas condensate. As stated previously,the composite liner system would consist of a flexible membrane liner asthe upper component and a compacted soil layer as the lower component.The soil layer would be at least three-feet thick with a hydraulic conductivityof no more than 1andmultiply;10<T3>^7</T3> cm/sec. The leachate collection system would need to be constructedto maintain less than a 30-cm depth of leachate over the liner. A variancemechanism would be provided to allow use of alternative designs based onsite-specific considerations. These variances would be based on the hydrogeologicalcharacteristics of the landfill, alternative operating methods, the resourcevalue of ground water, the nature of the alternative design, and otherfactors. The combination of these factors would have to provide a levelof environmental protection equal to the standard design.The Agency recognizes that this approach would likely be easier to implementand enforce and may provide greater assurance of protection of human healthand the environment than other options considered; EPA is not proposingthis approach because of concern regarding the difficulty in granting variancesand the resulting potential over-regulation of some facilities. The Agencyalso is concerned that this approach would limit the States' ability toadequately consider the practicable capability of the regulated community.<T3>c. Risk-Based Algorithm. </T3>The use of a risk-based algorithm isbased on the development of a predictive equation that can be used to determine,on a site-specific basis, the potential human health risks from a proposedlandfill. Such an approach could be simple to implement and could incorporatea large number of site-specific factors; however, the development of avalid predictive equation is difficult and its reliability would be limitedby the quality of data employed in it. Furthermore, one equation may notbe appropriate for all site-specific situations.<T3>d. Categorical Approach. </T3>Another alternative considered by EPA,which is described in detail in the next section of this preamble, is anapproach that would categorize locations based on hydrogeologic and climaticconditions. Specific designs would be identified for each category, andmethods for categorizing locations and their corresponding requirementswould be specified. This approach would be relatively easy to implementand would allow the consideration of site-specific conditions. The approachallows the consideration of climatic factors and geologic conditions, butno aquifer characteristics and ground-water resource value. Also, thisapproach might not adequately account for the practicable capability ofthe regulated facilities to comply. In addition, this approach would restrictState flexibility by prescribing a methodology States would use in establishingdesign requirements for various locations. While EPA has not proposed thisapproach today, EPA also is presenting this approach, along with the riskalgorithm, as possible methods for determining adequate designs for meetingthe performance standard proposed in andSection;258.40(a).The Agency recognizes that the choice of a particular type of standardis a very controversial decision and is interested in obtaining publiccomment on today's selection. The selection was based on an attempt tobalance several factors including the practicable capability of the regulatedcommunity to comply, States flexibility in implementing Subtitle D regulatoryprograms, and Federal or citizen suit enforceability. Commentors may wishto consider additional factors when providing comment and/or submit otherfactors for EPA's consideration.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Implementation of Performance Standard for New Units</ITAG>Today's proposal would require that new MSWLF units be designed with liners,LCSs, and final cover systems as necessary to meet the performance standarddescribed above. The specific type of design needed would vary dependingon the characteristics of the particular location. In some settings, comprehensiveliners and LCSs would be needed, whereas in other settings, minimal engineeringcontrols may be needed. This section provides a brief background on engineeringcontrols and describes various methods for determining the landfill designnecessary to achieve today's proposed performance standard.<T3>a. Overview of Engineering Controls. </T3>The purpose of lining anMSWLF unit is to prevent leachate from seeping from the site and enteringthe aquifer. A liner is a hydraulic barrier that prevents or greatly restrictsmigration of liquids, thus allowing leachate to be removed from the unitby the LCS. Liners function by two mechanisms: (1) They impede the flowof leachates into the subsoil and to the aquifer and (2) they adsorb orattenuate pollutants thus retarding the migration of contaminants. Thisadsorptive or attenuating capability is dependent largely upon the chemicalcompositions of the liner material and its mass. Most liner materials functionby both mechanisms but to different degrees depending on the type of linermaterial and the nature of the liquid to be contained. Liners may be groupedinto two major types: synthetic (flexible membrane liners) and natural(soil or clay liners).Flexible membrane liners are the least permeable of the liner materials,but have little capacity to attenuate dissolved pollutants. Natural linerscan have a large capacity to attenuate materials of different types, butthey are considerably more permeable than the FMLs. Both types of linermaterials can prevent or limit leachate migration out of the MSWLF.A review of the MSWLF case studies identified various types of liners currentlybeing used, including compacted native and imported soils, compacted mixturesof native soils and bentonite, and FMLs. The liner designs used variedsomewhat from region to region.In landfills designed with liners, a leachate collection and removal systemis necessary to relieve the hydraulic pressure within the landfill. Withouta collection and removal system, the leachate will accumulate, increasingthe driving force for migration through the base of the fill. Leachatecould eventually back up into the unit (i.e., the ``bathtub'' effect),resulting in seepage near the surface and possibly affecting surface watersor other receptors. Collection systems also may be needed when a landfillis located in saturated soils. Water from this saturated material eventuallywill seep into the waste and generate leachate if not removed by an LCS.The collection and removal of leachate from the unit will assist in meetingthe overall performance goal for the unit. An LCS generally consists ofperforated drain pipe installed in gravel-filled trenches above the linerat the base of the unit. The collection system is drained by gravity toa sump or series of sumps from which the leachate is withdrawn for treatmentor disposal. Additional details on the design and construction of LCSscan be found in ``Lining of Waste Impoundment and Disposal Facilities''(Ref. 36).The Agency believes that placement of a final cover over closed portionsof an MSWLF is necessary to: (1) Minimize infiltration of rainwater; (2)minimize dispersal of wastes by human, animal, or physical interactions;and (3) minimize the need for further maintenance at the facility duringthe post-closure period and beyond. The types and amounts of cover materialneeded to accomplish these goals and to achieve compliance with the designgoal are highly dependent on the location of the landfill. The amount ofinfiltration of water into the final cover and any subsequent percolationthrough the waste can be affected by surface conditions such as soil type,soil thickness, final grade, type of vegetation, and climatic factors suchas amount of precipitation, temperature, and evapotranspiration. For example,in areas with limited rainfall and high evapotranspiration, minimizinginfiltration may be achieved by: (1) Grading the unit in such a way asto promote run-off, (2) using the proper type and thickness of soil tomaximize moisture-holding capacity, and (3) establishing vegetation topromote plant transpiration of water. In areas of high rainfall and lowevapotranspiration, these design factors may not substantially reduce theamount of water entering the waste after closure. In such cases, additionaldesign factors, such as hydraulic barriers, either synthetic or compactedsoils, and/or drainage layers, may be required in the final cover to reduceinfiltration to acceptable levels. Further information on the design ofcover systems is available in a background document (Ref. 5).<T3>b. Methods for Evaluating Designs.</T3> Today's proposal does not prescribea single method for designing a facility to meet the performance standard.Because the Subtitle D program is implemented by the States, the Agencybelieves that the appropriate method for implementing the design performancestandard is best determined by the States; however, EPA is providing guidanceon three methods for determining what design is necessary to comply withthe performance standard (i.e., to meet the design goal at the point ofcompliance). These methods include: (1) A risk-based algorithm, (2) a categoricalapproach, and (3) an empirical method. A fourth method not discussed involvesusing a State-selected risk model. Although this last method is not described,the data needed and assumptions made for the risk-based algorithm may besimilar to what would be necessary for the State-selected risk model.For the risk-based algorithm (and the State-selected risk model), the designgoal is expressed as a risk level. The risk level selected as the designgoal is not directly involved in applying the categorical approach butis used to determine compliance and to establish clean-up levels for correctiveaction. The categorical approach presented today is based on preventingany leachate from migrating to the aquifer. Because of this no-migrationconcept, this approach is generally more conservative than the risk-basedalgorithm and in some cases would require more extensive engineering controlsthan would be determined from the risk-based algorithm.The empirical methodology uses historical ground-water monitoring datato assess the effectiveness of existing designs  in  meeting  the  design goal. The ground-water monitoring data would be used to calculate a risklevel that would be compared to the design goal.These three methods are described below and in more detail in the backgrounddocument on facility design (Ref. 5). EPA plans to issue a guidance documentaddressing facility design after the final rule is promulgated.(1) Risk-Based Algorithm. Using the Subtitle D Risk Model, EPA derivedan algorithm that characterizes a site's potential for ground-water contamination.This algorithm uses information on a facility's potential leachate releaserate and the characteristics of the site's hydrogeology to estimate thelevel of ground-water contamination that would result from an MSWLF operatingat that site. The level of contamination is represented in the algorithmby the excess lifetime cancer risk associated with human consumption ofground water at the landfill's compliance point. States and landfill ownersor operators can use this algorithm as a screening tool to determine whethera new MSWLF at a given site is likely to achieve compliance with the State-establisheddesign goal if constructed with no bottom liner and a vegetative cover.The risk-based algorithm cannot be used to analyze the reduction in humanhealth risks that would be achieved through the use of more stringent controltechnologies.The steps involved in using the risk-based algorithm are displayed in Figure1. The State would establish the design goal that is tied to the triggerlevels for hazardous constituents specified in andSection; 258.56 for thelandfill. If the calculated risk is lower than the design goal, this wouldimply that the proposed landfill would be in compliance with the performancestandard. If the calculated risk exceeds the design goal, the owner oroperator could choose a new site for the landfill, change the proposeddimensions of the landfill, or employ more stringent control systems (e.g.,bottom liners, leachate collection systems, different cover types). Theeffects of changes in location on risk potential could be calculated usingthe risk-based algorithm, while the effects of more stringent containmentand cover systems could not. EPA recommends that a more rigorous State-selectedassessment (either risk- or technology-based) be used to specify the mixof containment and cover system components capable of meeting the designgoal.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration 2 857</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-C</ITAG>The risk-based algorithm is as follows: <ITAG tagnum="26">R=4.5 * 10^4*(Q<T2>R</T2>/Q<T2>A</T2>)* e (TOT) (^0.029) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">where: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">R=lifetime risk posed by consumption of ground water at designatedcompliance point. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Q<T2>R</T2>=predicted leachate release rate to the uppermost aquifer, m\3\/yr.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Q<T2>A</T2>=ground-water flow rate for the uppermost aquifer, m\3\/yr. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">TOT=time-of-travel for leachate in this aquifer from the unit boundaryto the compliance point, years (TOT=0 for unit boundary compliance point).</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">In essence, the risk-based algorithm states that the risk associatedwith ground-water contamination from an MSWLF is a function of the rateof leachate release from the site and the attenuation (i.e., dispersionand degradation) of this leachate in the aquifer. Q<T2>R</T2> represents the annual leachate release rate, while Q<T2>A</T2> and TOT account for the dilution, dispersion and degradationof contaminants in ground water. Methods for calculating Q<T2>R</T2>, Q<T2>A</T2>, and TOT are described later.EPA acknowledges several limitations of this approach. First, this approachis dervied by assuming that the MSWLF risk results produced by the SubtitleD Risk Model represent ``true'' risks and fitting a simplified mathematicalmodel (i.e., the risk-based algorithm) to these results. The Subtitle DRisk Model is currently unverified for predicting ground-water contaminationresulting from MSWLFs. However, EPA believes the model is technically correctand believes that it can adequately characterize the risk from MSWLFs.Second, the approach assumes that the leachate produced from a particularlandfill will have a composition and constituent concentrations similarto that used in the Subtitle D Risk Model. The initial leachate constituentconcentrations used in the model represent the median concentrations forsix constituents found in samples of leachate from numerous MSWLFs (seeSection XI of preamble). (A complete discussion of the leachate constituentselection process, including the dose-response parameters used for theconstituents, is contained in the draft Regulatory Impact Analysis.) Therisk-based algorithm should not be used for proposed MSWLFs that have expectedleachate characteristics substantially different from those used in theSubtitle D Risk Model. EPA recommends that, at these landfills, a State-selectedRisk Model or other approach be used. Third, the risk-based algorithm never predicts risks higher than 4.5andmultiply;10^4.This value was derived from the Subtitle D Risk Model results for approximately500 distinct combinations of landfill size, environmental and hydrogeologicsetting, and exposure distance. In about 5 percent of these scenarios,the modeled risks were higher, although none exceeded 10^3. Fourth, although the risk-based algorithm is relatively powerful in a statisticalsense (i.e., its predicted risks correlate well to the Subtitle D RiskModel's predicted risks), its use introduces some additional uncertainty.The State might account for some of the uncertainty in the approach bysetting the risk-based algorithm goal somewhat lower than the actual designgoal. For instance, if the State determines that the actual design goalshould be 1andmultiply;10^4, it could state that any MSWLF with calculatedrisks exceeding 1andmultiply;10^5 would be required to perform a more detailedsite-specific assessment. Such a margin of safety (in this example, oneorder-of-magnitude) would allow the States and owners and operators toidentify low-risk MSWLFs relatively quickly and focus more effort on borderlineor high-risk MSWLFs. EPA recommends that the States determine the acceptablemargin of safety between the risk-based algorithm-predicted risk and thedesign goal.Fifth, the risk-based algorithm does not apply to sites with complex hydrogeology.The ground-water concentrations in sites characterized by fractured, folded,or faulted rock, karst terrain, tidally-induced changes in ground-waterflow, or similar complex conditions are not represented in the underlyingSubtitle D Risk Model, and thus the risk-based algorithm does not predictthem. In these conditions, EPA recommends more sophisticated analyticaltechniques be used. Sixth, characterizing the variables needed to solve the algorithm for anindividual site may be both costly and difficult. However, some simplemethods are available to make these determinations, as discussed later.These limitations thus relate to the ease of implementation and the uncertaintyembodied in the approach. EPA has attempted to propose the risk-based algorithmin a form that strikes a reasonable balance between the desire for accuracyand certainty on the one hand, and timely, moderate-cost implementationon the other.In order to develop the risk-based algorithm, the Agency identified fromcase studies, damage cases, field observation, Subtitle D risk modelingresults, and other sources several environmental factors that affect leachategeneration, leachate release, migration, exposure, and risk. These factorsinclude landfill size, net infiltration, subgrade permeability, depth toground water, aquifer flow rate, and time-of-travel from the unit to apotential exposure point. Using the list of key environmental factors,EPA conducted an analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a regression analysis.The ANOVA allowed EPA to determine the importance of each of the environmentalvariables in explaining the variation in the predicted MSWLF's risk. Theregression analysis, coupled with an understanding of the physiochemicalprocesses that affect risk, allowed EPA to establish a simple equation,using the key environmental variables identified in the ANOVA, to predicta facility's risk.For the purpose of the ANOVA and regression analysis, EPA used the riskspredicted from the Subtitle D Risk Model. For this application, the modelsimulated approximately 500 exposure scenarios comprising unique combinationsof infiltration rates, facility size, depth to water table, hydrogeologicconditions (aquifer velocity and configuration), and exposure point. Foreach scenario, EPA predicted the highest lifetime health risk that wouldbe experienced over a 300-year simulation period.In establishing the importance of the environmental variables, the Agencygenerated a series of ANOVA tables displaying the relationship betweenthe identified (independent) environmental variables and risk, the dependentvariable. The ANOVA tables provided EPA with a means to evaluate the strengthof the association between risk and the various independent variables.The ANOVA results indicated that none of the environmental variables aloneexplains more than 10 percent of the variability in risk. EPA then combinedsome of the related variables to test the relationship between risk andthree ``top'' parameters: leachate flux (Q<T2>R</T2>), aquifer flux (Q<T2>A</T2>), and TOT. Q<T2>R</T2> is a function of several variables including the facility size,the infiltration rate, and the subgrade permeability. Q<T2>A</T2> is a function of the aquifer velocity (i.e., permeability andhydraulic gradient), aquifer thickness, and effective porosity. It accountsfor the dilution and attenuative capacity of the aquifer, and is measuredat the downradient point of compliance. TOT is a function of the aquifervelocity and distance to the downgradient compliance point. Using these``top'' parameters, EPA analyzed several forms of the equation used topredict MSWLF risks.As with most regression equations, the chosen algorithm omits some independentvariables that could increase the explanatory power of the model; however,EPA believes that it is better to use fewer variables and keep the classificationscheme simple. EPA believes that the relationship is conceptually validand realistically depicts the actual physical relationships between theseparameters. To apply the risk-based algorithm at a given site, the owner or operatormust calculate three variables: leachate flux (Qr), aquifer flux (Qa),and ground-water TOT. Several methods exist for calculating TOT, Q<T2>A</T2>, and Q<T2>R</T2>. TOT equals the distance between the landfill unit boundaryand the compliance point; this distance is then divided by the ground-watervelocity. Thus, TOT will equal zero whenever a unit boundary compliancepoint is selected. Calculation of ground-water velocity requires eitherfield measurement or obtaining estimates of hydraulic conductivity, hydraulicgradient, and effective porosity from available literature. Ground-watervelocity equals KI/n, where K is the hydraulic conductivity, I is the hydraulicgradient, and n is the effective porosity. Q<T2>A </T2>also can be determined either by field measurement or by empiricalcalculation. Q<T2>A </T2>equals KIA, where K is the hydraulic conductivity, I is thehydraulic gradient, and A is the cross-sectional are of the aquifer. Q<T2>R</T2> can be calculated as the product of the surface area of theMSWLF and the annual recharge. The surface area of the landfill can betaken from site maps and plans. Recharge can be estimated either empiricallyor through use of a water balance method. EPA recognizes that this approachof calculating Q<T2>R</T2> does not account for the potential effects of low-permeabilitywastes or subgrades in limiting the rate at which leachate can be releasedfrom a landfill. In most cases, the leachate release rate will be limitedby the recharge rather than the permeability of the waste or the subgrade.EPA realizes that the cost of estimating values for some of these variablescan be high, depending on the method used. EPA believes, however, thatat least some of these costs would be incurred independently of the useof the algorithm (e.g., hydrogeologic studies). EPA requests comments on this approach, particularly on the utility ofthe approach; the difficulty in implementing it; the leachate characterization;environmental transport; the technical accuracy of the risk-based algorithm;and methods for addressing the uncertainty inherent throughout the riskassessment that is the conceptual foundation for this approach. (2) Categorical Approach. The categorical approach is an engineering approachfor determining whether a facility will meet the performance standard andis based on the ability to match location characteristics to specific designrequirements. The intent is to present a simplified methodology that accountsfor liquid migration in the overburden (the material between the bottomof the unit and the top of the aquifer). The categorical approach is designedto achieve minimal releases to the aquifer, which is somewhat more stringentthan the performance goal proposed today (i.e., meet design goal at unitboundary or alternative boundary). A relative comparison of the (estimated)necessary designs, costs, and benefits of the categorical approach to theproposal is contained in the draft Regulatory Impact Analysis.The approach uses two basic elements. First, the design selected for useduring the active life, takes into account local hydrogeologic and climaticconditions to prevent liquids from reaching the aquifer. Second, at closure,a final cover system is used that minimizes the generation of leachateby preventing the infiltration of liquid into the waste. The Agency recognizesthat the final cover will not stop leachate from migrating to the aquifer,but the final cover will minimize the amount of water that moves throughthe waste into the aquifer. By reducing the amount that enters the aquifer,EPA believes that the performance standard specified in andSection; 258.40(a)can be met because the dilution and attenuation that occurs in the aquiferwill reduce the concentrations of the small amounts of contaminants thatescape the landfill.Because the categorical approach seeks to minimize constituent releasesto aquifers, it is conservative approach to designing facilities to meettoday's performance standard. The State and the owner or operator shouldbe aware of this when using this approach to identify designs necessaryto meet today's performance standard.The categorical approach is based on the potential for contaminants inleachate to migrate from the MSWLF. Leachate is formed by rainwater andother liquids percolating through the solid waste in the landfill. Differenthydrogeologic and climatic settings influence both the rate at which leachateis generated and the potential for leachate to escape from the unit andeventually reach ground water. Under this approach, location categoriesare established based on the migration potential of water from the landfillunit. Once the location categories are defined, design requirements arespecified to offset the effects of ``poor'' locational factors to counteractthe rapid movement of contaminants from the MSWLF to the aquifer that these``poor'' locations promote.Under this approach, locations are categorized based on the climate andgeology, which determine the potential for contaminants to migrate intothe aquifer. In developing this approach, climate and geology were evaluatedto determine their contribution and importance to the generation and migrationof leachate from landfills. Because this approach is based on preventingthe migration of leachate to the aquifer during the active life of theunit, aquifer characteristics do not play a role in the selection of designrequirements necessary to meet the design standard.<T3>(a) Climatic Factors. </T3>The Agency believes that climatic conditionsare key factors in determining the rate and amount of leachate that willbe generated in an MSWLF unit. The climate of a particular area is dependentupon the interrelationships of numerous conditions. The factors that theAgency evaluated in developing the categorical approach are: Precipitation,potential evaporation, potential evapotranspiration, temperature, and run-off.Each factor is discussed briefly below.Precipitation normally is expressed as the amount of rainfall and snowfallthat occurs at a specific location. Precipitation is the primary climaticfactor affecting the generation of leachate at landfills. When precipitationenters a landfill, it infiltrates the wastes and dissolves contaminantsto form leachate. As more leachate is formed, hydraulic head is built upat the base of the landfull that acts as a driving force for migrationto the subsurface. Both the rate and degree to which this process occurswill vary, based on the location of the MSWLF.Potential evaporation (PE), measured as pan evaporation, is normally expressedas the amount of water that potentially will evaporate from a free watersurface at a specific location. This factor often is similar to lake evaporationand is not representative of MSWLF conditions. Potential evapotranspiration(PET) is normally expressed as the potential amount of water that willevaporate from soil surfaces and transpire through plants at a given area.Normally, PET is lower than PE in a given area. Temperature plays an importantrole in potential evaporation and potential evapotranspiration for a givenlocation; the values for these factors incorporate the effects of temperature.Run-off, although not a climatic factor, normally is expressed as the amountof water that will migrate from the site in the form of overland flow.Major land surface conditions affecting surface run-off include topography,cover material, vegetation, soil permeability, antecedent soil moisture,and artificial drainage.In order to achieve the overall goal of this methodology (preventing leachatefrom reaching the aquifer during the active life of the unit), it is necessaryto determine the factor or factors that best represent the potential amountof moisture available for entering the waste, thereby generating leachate.The Agency evaluated the above factors to determine which factor or factorsbest characterized the climatic elements relevant to leachate generation.The objective of the evaluation was to determine the potential for leachategeneration during the active life of a unit. As stated earlier, the Agencybelieves that once the MSWLF is properly closed and covered, leachate generationshould be minimal. No single factor or combination of factors could befound that adequately characterized climatic elements such that leachategeneration during the active life could be estimated. EPA, therefore, selecteda simple two-step process that can be used to categorize locations basedon climate. This process uses mean annual precipitation as the factor inthe first step.The first step of the process requires that the mean annual precipitation(P) for an area be determined. P was chosen because: (1) It is easily determined,(2) it does not necessarily require the collection of new data, and (3)it conservatively describes the amount of water potentially available forinfiltration and leachate generation. Using P conservatively estimatesthe amount of leachate formed because it does not consider evaporationor run-off. Values of P can be obtained from the National Weather Service,the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and/orUSGS Water Atlases. These sources have collected rainfall data over extendedperiods of time, so values from these sources should be representativeof annual rainfall in an area.The Agency believes that there is a relationship between precipitationand leachate generation. Based on an evaluation of MSWLFs in differentclimatic settings, EPA has concluded that areas that receive more than40 inches or precipitation per year generate leachate in quantities sufficientto warrant collection. Therefore, under the categorical approach, unitslocated in areas that receive more than 40 inches of precipitation annuallywould be required to have leachate collection. For areas that receive lessthan 40 inches of precipitation per year, the evaluation indicates thatleachate may not always be generated in amounts necessitating collection.Therefore, the second step of the process is to estimate the amount ofleachate formed in areas receiving less than 40 inches of precipitationto determine if enough leachate is generated to warrant collection.This estimate incorporates factors that determine the potential for leachateaccumulation at a specific landfill. The factors used include P, PET, actualevapotranspiration, soil moisture holding capacity, waste moisture holdingcapacity, and run-off. Because MSWLFs are ongoing construction projects,the relationship among these factors relative to leachate accumulationcontinually changes. Therefore, a demonstration method that evaluates thepotential amount of leachate accumulation at different stages of landfillconstruction is necessary. Under this method, the evaluation would be basedon the projected landfill configuration at the end of each operating year.The Agency believes that some facilities in low precipitation locationsmay be able to eliminate the need for leachate collection by adjustingoperational characteristics of the site.The following steps are needed to determine when an LCS is necessary:<T3>Step 1: </T3>Estimate topographic contours of the unit at the end ofeach operating year throughout the active life until final cover has beeninstalled.<T3>Step 2: </T3>Compute the quantity of leachate generated for each yearof active life using the water balance method. This step may require dividingthe landfill unit into discrete areas to take into account differing gradesand variations in surface run-off. If so desired, the moisture-holdingcapability of soil layers used for cover could be considered. Most activeportions of a landfull will have no vegetative cover, so moisture lossby evapotranspiration should not be considered in the water balance calculation.Moisture loss from active portions should be accounted for by using estimatesof evaporation from bare soil as described in an EPA guidance document(Ref. 35).<T3>Step 3: </T3>Calculate the total accumulation of leachate at the baseof the unit by adding the amount of leachate generated to the amount predictedfor each previous year.<T3>Step 4: </T3>If total accumulation of leachate at the base of the unit(as determined by Step 3) exceeds or equals one foot at any stage of thelandfill construction, an LCS is necessary. For example, for a unit thathas a three-year active life: for year one, it is estimated that one footof field capacity of the waste remains and no leachate is generated. Foryear two, it is determined that one foot of field capacity remains and,again, no leachate is generated. However, for year three, before finalcover is installed, it is determined that field capacity for the portionof unit planned to be built that year will be exceeded and four feet ofleachate will be generated. Presuming that the year three portion of theunit is on top of the year two and year one portions of the unit, the totaleffect will be to negate the unused moisture holding capacity of the previoustwo years and result in a head build-up of two feet at the base of theunit, which is sufficient to require the installation of an LCS. This methodis further discussed in the backgound document supporting this proposal(Ref. 5).<T3>(b) Geologic Factors. </T3>The nature and extent of the geologic materialunderlying a given MSWLF site strongly influence the fate of any leachategenerated. The categorical approach estimates the effects of various geologicmaterials based on the time it takes water to move through the materialabove the aquifer. Because leachate is an aqueous solution EPA believesit is reasonable to model water movement rather than leachate movementin the subsurface. The Agency believes this simplifying assumption is conservative.This simplified approach does not include consideration of the variabilityof MSWLF leachate over time. Also some factors that retard constituentmovement, such as absorption, chemical precipitation, degradation, andattenuation, that can result in slower movement of the constituent thanthe solute (i.e., water) are not a part of this simplified approach. Therefore,the Agency believes that considering only the rate of liquid movement isa conservative approach. Certain geologic characteristics control the rate at which leachate willmigrate to the aquifier. For the categorical approach, the rate must bedetermined so that design features can be added when the natural conditionsdo not give adequate protection to the aquifier. The geologic factors evaluatedincluded the following: Depth, saturated hydraulic conductivity, effectiveporosity, and linear velocity. Depth (D) refers to the thickness of the geologic material between thebottom of the unit and the top of the aquifier. This zone is referred toas the overburden. Saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) is a measureof the ability of porous media (soils or rock) to transmit liquids undersaturated conditions. Effective porosity (N<T2>e</T2>) is a measure of the interconnected pore space in the geologicmaterial. Porosity has a controlling influence on the linear velocity ofwater in the overburden media. Linear velocity (V) is the speed at whichground water travels in the subsurface under saturated conditions. Different methodologies were evaluated that could be used to estimate thetime for liquids to migrate through the overburden to the aquifier, knownas time of travel (T) to the aquifer. The methodologies involve: (1) Calculationof T based on a detailed time-of-travel measurement through the overburden(for saturated and unsaturated geologic material) using the approachesprescribed for determining vulnerable hydrogeology under Subtitle C (Ref.11), (2) calculation based on Darcy's law, expressed as T=D/Ksat, (3) calculationto T=D/V (based on the linear velocity of water in the overburden withan assumed hydraulic gradient of one), and (4) a wetting front approachfor unsaturated soil only. The detailed time-of-travel analysis results in the most accurate predictionof when leachate may reach the aquifer under ideal conditions; however,it is very data-intensive and complex, particularly for unsaturated conditions.It also requires the development of flow nets. The second and third methods are more straightforward because the necessarydata are readily available from literature and field tests. Because oftheir simplicity, these methods could be used to pre-screen locations withdata available from the literature. These data should be verified by fieldtests prior to site design because field verification is necessary to ensurethat site-specific conditions match conditions predicted by the literature.D-Ksat is the simpler method to use because it needs only two easily obtainedpieces of data: Saturated hydraulic conductivity and depth. Numerous methodsare available for determining saturated hydraulic conductivity. For example,in fractured consolidated rock, pressure tests or falling head tests canbe used to evaluate Ksat. In unconsolidated materials, constant head gravitytests are commonly used. These and other methods are available and documented.It is important, however, to ensure that the proper methods are used inthe material being evaluated. Depth may be obtained easily from a preliminarysubsurface exploratory program and/or from boring and drilling logs fromsurrounding areas. The third method, D/V, is believed to be more accurate than the secondmethod because the velocity (V) incorporates effective porosity (N<T2>c</T2>) in the calculation. As mentioned above, effective porosityis a measure of the interconnected pore space in geologic material. Itcan be an important controlling influence on hydraulic conductivity (andthus rate of flow) in both unconsolidated and consolidated formations.Porosity values range from 0 to 5 percent for dense crystalline rock, 25to 40 percent for gravel, and 40 to 70 percent for clay. In fractured rock,secondary porosity also must be considered. When determining the porosityof the overburden at a specific site, both primary and secondary porosityshould be considered as warrented. Although more accurate than D/Ksat, the D/V method has some features thatmake it less accurate than the detailed time-of-travel calculation discussedearlier. First, it assumes that the hydraulic gradient (a major influenceon ground-water velocity) is equal to one. This assumption will resultin a conservative time-of-travel value (i.e., the actual time may be longer).Second, it assumed fully saturated conditions, which in most cases willresult in a conservative value. The fourth method involves a wetting front equation and may be a betterpredictor of flow in the unsaturated zone. The method requires the collectionof more data than either the second or third method. This method is basedon equations developed for infiltration of water into dry soil and appliessimplifying assumptions to calculate the time of travel. The equation usedto calculate the time of travel is given as: <ITAG tagnum="26">T=(LWr)/q</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">where:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">T=time of travel (T).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">L=length of the unsaturated zone (L).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Wr=change in moisture content from soil behind the wetting front todry soil ahead of the wetting front. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">q=infiltration rate (L/T).</ITAG>The length of the unsaturated zone (L) can be determined from boring logsand piezometer measurements. Moisture content behind and ahead of the wettingfront can be calculated, and, therefore, Wr can be determined from fieldmeasurements or estimated from empirical equations. The infiltration rateis (q) approximated by using the net precipitation. The principle assumption of this approach is that there exists a distinctand definable wetting front, and that behind the wetting front the soilis uniformly wet and of constant conductivity. The wetting front approachis applicable for a limited range of conditions. In particular, the approachis useful when a constant water flux is applied to initially dry soil.The approach may not be applicable for soils that are initially moist orthat are uniform in moisture content under natural infiltration conditions.The principle value of the approach is in predicting unsaturated flow.The Agency believes that the D/V method of calculating T is conservativeand easy to calculate. The categorical approach assumes saturated flowbecause the available methodologies that can be used to estimate the flowtime of water through unsaturated materials are complex and require extensivedata collection. Calculating the time of flow for saturated materials involvesless complex equations and requires fewer resources to obtain the requireddata inputs. Furthermore, the use of saturated conditions is generallyconservative in predicting time-of-travel in the overburden because, forthe most part, K values increase as soil moisture content increases fora given soil type. The Agency recognizes that in certain unsaturated soils,particularly clays, saturation may not be a conservative assumption. Initialbreakthrough of leachate, in small amounts, may occur prior to the prediction,assuming saturation. For the purpose of categorization, EPA believes thatit is more important to predict when a major amount of leachate may enterthe aquifer. However, the owner or operator has the option of using analternative method, including the detailed Subtitle C time-of-travel calculationor the wetting front approach. Under this simplified approach (D/V method), the value selected for T canbe used to determine which locations require liners and the type of linerthat may be required. The methodology is based on the active life of theunit. A value of T equal to or greater than the active life of the MSWLFunit is classed as ``long'' and a T less than the active life as ``short.''A minimum cut-off value for T of 20 years has been selected because a minimumT precludes the siting of short duration units in relatively poor locations.This minimum value of 20 years for T was chosen because the average activelife of a facility is approximately 30 years, and a facility usually consistsof more than one unit. EPA therefore selected 20 years as the average lifeof a unit. T values that are long when compared to the active life of theunit would not need liner systems, while units with T values shorter thanthe active life of that unit would need liners. The T value should be determined for each unit rather than for an entirefacility. For example, an MSWLF may have a total life of 50 years but compriseseveral units with active lives less than 50 years each. The T for eachof these units is a separate calculation.<T3>(c) Relationship to Design Requirements</T3>. Combining P and T valuesresults in a matrix comprising four blocks that correspond to separatecategories, as shown in Figure 2. Each location category describes a hydrogeologicand climatic setting with unique characteristics that affect landfill design.For example, Category I has both good climatic characteristics for a landfill(limited precipitation indicated by the low P) and good hydrogeology (acceptableoverburden characteristics evidenced by high T value). On the other hand,Category IV represents locations with poor climate and hydrogeology thatrequire specific landfill designs (liners and LCSs) to compensate for thepoor locational characteristics. The two key measures of precipitationand time-of-travel to the aquifer are used not only to establish the locationcategories, but to identify the landfill design requirements needed fora particular location. <ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration 2 876</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-C</ITAG>In Categories I and III, the low P value indicates that the potential forleachate generation is less than in Categories II and IV. This low potentialis not to imply that leachate will not be generated in quantities sufficientto warrant a collection system at facilities in low P areas. The demonstrationdescribed earlier to determine if an LCS is necessary should be conducted.In Categories II and IV, high P values indicate that climatic conditionsare conducive to the continual generation of leachate. Leachate control,therefore, is necessary in order to prevent the buildup of a hydraulichead within the unit during the active life of the facility. Any leachategenerated after the active life of the unit also must be collected.In addition, the Agency believes that LCSs are necessary when flexiblemembrane liners are installed. FMLs are very efficient hydraulic barriers,and an LCS is necessary to remove the hydraulic head that accumulates overtime. FMLs installed without such systems will ultimately result in the``bathtub'' effect.Facilities sited in Category I and II locations have overburdens that alreadysatisfy the requirements that T at least equals the active life of theunit. Therefore, modifications to the overburden would not be necessaryat these sites. Some Category I and II locations, however, may need a linerif they need an LCS and if the natural overburden material does not havea permeability low enough to allow the LCS to properly function. For example,a site may have an adequate thickness of silty sand to be classified asCategory II, but the permeability of this silty sand may be inadequateto allow the LCS to function properly. The base of the unit may need tobe modified.Facilities sited in Category III and IV locations have overburden materialsthat do not have T values that are at least equal to the active life ofthe unit or 20 years, whichever is greater. These units should installearthen or synthetic liners or modify the existing subbase such that, incombination with the overburden, the composite T value meets the standard.This may require measures such as soil amendments, recompaction of existingmaterials, and installation of synthetic membranes.As discussed earlier, under this approach a final cover system that preventsliquid filtration into the water after closure is necessary. Acceptablemethods for determining the design for such a final cover were discussedin a previous section.(3) Empirical Methodology. A third approach for determining the landfilldesign characteristics necessary to comply with this rule's design goalrelies on the use of ground-water monitoring data from existing MSWLFs.Under this approach, an owner or operator planning lateral expansions ofan existing facility or planning to build new units in similar locationsto an existing unit could use ground-water monitoring results from existingunits to determine if the new or expanded units need to employ designsthat are more protective than the existing unit. If the concentration ofconstitutents detected in the existing units' ground-water monitoring wellsdo not exceed the design goal (and leachate from the unit could be reasonablyexpected to have reached the monitoring wells), then the new or expandedunit would not have to apply a more elaborate containment design than theexisting unit has to comply with this rule's design goal.Four conditions would have to be met before this approach could be used.First, the new or expanded unit must have sufficiently similar locationand waste characteristics to the existing unit to not pose greater threatsto human health and the environment than the existing unit. Second, theexisting unit must have operated ground-water monitoring wells over a longenough period to allow for leachate generation and release (accountingfor the time required for failure of any liners) and migration throughthe unsaturated and saturated zones to the monitoring wells. Third, theground-water monitoring data must address the Phase I parameters (and PhaseII parameters, if Phase II has been triggered). Fourth, the monitoringdata must be supplemented with appropriate modeling to predict the fateof hazardous constituents over a time period equivalent to the post-closurecare period proposed today. This approach would be used most frequentlyfor expansions of existing MSWLFs that have conducted ground-water monitoringover a long period of time.The Agency recognizes that all three approaches are new methodologies thathave not been a part of permitting programs. Comment is requested on theappropriateness of these approaches to a specific permit program or anindividual landfill design. Comment is requested on the overall approachesand on ways to modify any approach to make it easier to incorporate intoan existing permitting program.E. Subpart E_Ground-Water Monitoring and Corrective ActionEPA today is proposing ground-water monitoring and corrective action requirementsto ensure that ground-water contamination at new and existing MSWLFs willbe detected and cleaned up as necessary to protect human health and theenvironment. These requirements reflect Congressional intent, as interpretedthrough HSWA and the accompanying legislative history, that protectionof ground water be a prime concern of the revised Criteria. HSWA specificallydirected EPA to require ground-water monitoring as necessary to detectcontamination and corrective action, as appropriate, to protect human healthand the environment.The existing Criteria under andSection; 257.3-4 require that a facility orpractice shall not contaminate an underground drinking water source beyondthe solid waste boundary or beyond an alternate boundary established bythe State. The existing Criteria define ``contaminate'' to mean the introductionof a substance that would cause: (1) An MCL for any of 10 inorganic chemicals,four chlorinated hydrocarbons, or two chlorophenoxys to be exceeded or(2) a background level to be exceeded for any of these 16 constituentswhen such background concentration already exceeds an MCL. The existingPart 257 does not specifically require facilities to monitor ground waterbeneath their units or to implement a corrective action program when ground-watercontamination has occurred. Facilities that are in violation of the currentCriteria, however, are required to close or enter into a compliance schedulewith their respective State.Today's proposed Criteria revisions completely replace the existing criteriafor MSWLFs under 40 CFR 257.3-4, providing ground-water monitoring andcorrective action requirements under 40 CFR Part 258 for all new and existingMSWLF units. The proposed requirements call for assessment of the hydrogeologybeneath landfill units, ground-water monitoring, reports on ground-waterquality, the establishment of ground-water trigger levels and ground-waterprotection standards, and corrective action. These requirements are discussedseparately below.The corrective action program proposed today addresses releases to groundwater only. In section 4010 of HSWA, Congress specifically instructs theAgency to evaluate the current Subtitle D criteria (40 CFR Part 257) fortheir adequacy to protect human health and the environment from ground-watercontamination. Congress clearly considers ground-water contamination tobe the major concern, and indeed, requires the new criteria (today's proposal)to provide for ground-water monitoring to detect contamination and correctiveaction, as appropriate. For this reason, the corrective action programenvisioned today addresses releases to ground water. In addition, thereare other authorities the Agency may use to address corrective action atMSWLFs. These authorities (e.g., CERCLA, RCRA Section 7003, the Clean WaterAct) may be used to address media other than ground water.The Agency did, however, consider addressing corrective action for allmedia while developing today's proposal. The Agency requests comment onthe need for corrective action requirements for surface water and soilcontamination at MSWLFs. (The Agency currently is assessing the risks associatedwith releases to air from MSWLFs and is considering proposing regulationsto control these emissions.) Currently, the Agency has very little datadescribing the extent or the risks posed by soil or surface water contaminationat MSWLFs.If corrective action requirements were deemed necessary for surface waterand soils, the Agency would most likely consider provisions similar tothose required for ground water. Specifically, the Agency would considerrequiring monitoring, trigger levels, a corrective measures study, cleanupstandards, and criteria for selecting remedies. Appropriate trigger levelsfor surface water may be water quality standards (WQS) (developed by theState based on Federal Water Quality Criteria) or, if a WQS was unavailable,MCLs may be appropriate (for surface waters used for drinking water). Ifneither MCLs nor WQS has been established, an appropriate trigger levelmay be a concentration that meets the criteria specified in andSection; 258.52of today's proposal, assuming consumption of the contaminated water. Ifthe surface waters are designated for a use other than drinking water,the appropriate trigger level may be a concentration established by theState that meets the criteria specified in andSection; 258.52 of today'sproposal and takes into consideration the use or uses of the receivingwaters.Appropriate trigger levels for contaminants in soils might be concentrationsthat meet the criteria specified in andSection; 258.52 of today's proposaland that assume exposure through consumption of the contaminated soil.If trigger levels for soils and/or surface water cannot be developed (becausea concentration that meets the criteria in andSection; 258.52 is not available),an appropriate trigger level might be a State-developed concentration thatserves as an indicator for protection of human health and the environmentand incorporates the above-referenced exposure assumptions. If not health-basedtrigger level is available, the appropriate trigger may be the backgroundconcentration.If the Agency expands the critiera to address corrective action for releasesto all media, it may consider using the following compliance points. Forsoils, the point of compliance for achieving the cleanup level may be anypoint where direct contact exposure to the soils may occur. The State mayspecify the locations or methods for determining appropriate locationswhere soil samples should be taken to demonstrate compliance with the soilcleanup standard(s). For surface water, the criteria might require thatthe surface water cleanup standard be achieved at the point where the release(s)enters the surface water in its highest concentration. The State may specifythe location where surface water or sediment samples should be taken tomonitor surface water quality and to demonstrate that compliance with thesurface water cleanup standard has been achieved.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Section 258.50 Applicability</ITAG>Today's proposed ground-water monitoring and corrective action requirementsapply to the owners or operators of all new and existing MSWLFs. The Agencyhas several reasons for applying ground-water monitoring requirements toall new and existing MSWLFs. First, the Agency believes that the Congressionalintent was to require ground-water monitoring at all MSWLFs that may receiveHHW or SQG waste. Section 4010(c) directs EPA specifically to include ground-watermonitoring ``as necessary to detect contamination'' among the revisionsto the criteria and, while allowing the Agency to consider practicablecapability, does not identify any exceptions to this requirement. The legislativehistory also is silent with respect to any exemptions from ground-watermonitoring.Second, as discussed earlier in this preamble, EPA has evidence that goundwater has been contaminated by MSWLFs on a local basis in many parts ofthe nation and on a regional basis in some heavily populated and industrializedareas. Evaluation of 163 MSWLF case studies has indicated ground-watercontamination or adverse trends in ground-water quality at 146 of theselandfills. The Agency recognizes that these case studies may not be representativeof the universe of MSWLFs; however, they do provide examples of the impactsof improperly designed or operated MSWLFs.Current data from a 1986 survey indicate that only 25 to 30 percent ofMSWLFs currently are equipped with ground-water monitoring systems; therefore,the total number of MSWLFs that are contaminating gorund water is unknown.Information submitted by the States in 1984, however, indicated that ground-watercontamination has been detected at 586 active MSWLFs or roughly 25 percentof those facilities that currently are monitoring ground water. The natureand extent of the contamination from these sites is unknown. In addition,as of May 1986, EPA has included 184 MSWLFs on the Superfund National PrioritiesList.The case studies and risk assessments indicate that these failing landfillsare located in a wide range of hydrogeologic and climatic settings, makingit virtually impossible, on a regional basis, for the Agency to predictwhich existing landfills may be contaminating ground-water resources. Therefore,the ground-water monitoring requirements are not restricted to landfillsof a particular age or region.Third, ground-water monitoring is the most reliable method for determiningwhether a landfill is in compliance with the overall performance standardof the proposed Criteria revisions, i.e., to meet health-based limits forhazardous constituents in the ground water at the waste management boundaryor alternative boundary specified by the State. Even the best designs,operating practices, and quality control procedures cannot always preventunexpected failure of a landfill. Therefore, ground-water monitoring atall facilities, including those that are properly designed and operated,is viewed by the Agency as an essential measure to ensure protection ofhuman health and the environment.Because this proposal requires MSWLFs to conduct ground-water monitoring,today's action effectively prohibits the location of MSWLFs in areas wheresubsurface conditions prevent monitoring of contaminant migration fromthe landfill unit. MSWLFs in such unmonitorable areas will be unable toreceive an operating permit from the State. Some geologic settings thatcould preclude effective ground-water monitoring are fractured bedrockwhere complex fractures and joint systems impede flow direction prediction,and areas where extensive subsurface mining or faulting has modified flowdirection. The ability to perform corrective action as necessary also mustbe considered. It is the responsibility of the owner or operator to provethat a landfill unit can be monitored. The Agency requests comment on addinga specific location restriction for unmonitorable areas in the final rule.Section 258.50(b) specifies that ground-water monitoring requirements ofandSection; 258.50 through andSection; 258.55 will be suspended for ownersand operators who can demonstrate that there is no potential for migrationof hazardous constituents from the landfill unit to the uppermost aquiferduring the active life, closure, or post-closure periods. The requirementsof andSection; 258.56 through andSection; 258.58 are never suspended, however.The proposed limited suspension of the ground-water monitoring requirementsprovided in the andSection; 258.50(b) is designed for MSWLF units locatedin hydrogeologic settings that prevent leachate migration to ground waterfor very long periods of time. In such a setting, leachate from the MSWLFshould not be able to reach the uppermost aquifer during the active life,closure, or during post-closure care. Because of the very favorable hydrogeologicconditions, such settings are highly desirable for the location of MSWLFsand the Agency wishes to encourage the use of these settings. Furthermore,requiring ground-water monitoring in these settings would place an additionalfinancial burden on the owner or operator with very little added protectionto human health and the environment. The financial burdens placed on ownersor operators in these settings would be high because of increased drillingcosts caused by the extreme depths to ground water that are typical inthese settings.The Agency intends to ensure that there is a high degree of confidencein the demonstration that no leachate will reach the uppermost aquiferbefore an exemption from the ground-water monitoring requirements is allowed.Therefore, today's proposal requires that the demonstration be conductedby a qualified geologist or geotechnical engineer based on site-specifichydrogeologic information or, where that is insufficient, based on assumptionsthat maximize the rate of hazardous constituent migration.While andSection; 258.50(a) of today's proposal requires ground-water monitoringat all MSWLFs, except in the rare circumstances described above, the Agencyis proposing to ease the burden of this requirement by phasing in the ground-watermonitoring requirements over time. The Agency is proposing this approachbecause the thousands of wells that will be needed at the approximately6,000 existing MSWLFs are expected to cause shortfalls in the availabilityof competent hydrogeologists and drilling companies who must assist theowner or operator in sampling and analyzing the landfill's hydrogeology,provide recommendations on well placement, drill the appropriate bore holesand monitoring well holes, and install the monitoring wells.Furthermore, the Agency recognizes that the proper review and evaluationof proposed ground-water monitoring programs will place significant demandson State resources. Therefore, andSection; 258.50(c) of today's proposalrequires States to establish compliance schedules for each facility withinsix months of the effective date of this rule. This six-month period isthe maximum amount of time that a State should take in setting complianceschedules. The sooner an owner or operator knows when the MSWLF must bein compliance with the ground-water monitoring requirements, the betterthe necessary activities can be planned. The Agency has set goals for thepercentage of existing units that must be in compliance after the effectivedate of this rule. Within two years of the effective date, 25 percent ofthe existing landfill units must be in compliance; within three years ofthe effective date, 50 percent of the existing landfill units must be incompliance; within four years of the effective date, 75 percent of theexisting units must be in compliance; and all landfill units must be incompliance within five years of the effective date. Any new unit must bein compliance with the ground-water monitoring requirements before acceptingwaste.States should set compliance schedules for each facility based on an evaluationof the potential risks posed by the facility. Risks posed to human healthand the environment can be weighed by considering the proximity of humanand environmental receptors, design of the landfill unit, age of the landfillunit, and resource value of the underlying aquifer. The Agency believesthat ground-water monitoring is critical at existing facilities that posea threat to human health or the environment and expects States to moveaggressively to address these facilities as soon as possible.If a State does not set a schedule of compliance for MSWLF units, andSection;258.50(d) specifies a compliance schedule for owners or operators of landfills.This ``fall-back'' schedule is based on distance to the nearest drinkingwater intake. While this method of setting priorities does not ascertainpotential risk as well as the method outlined in andSection; 258.50(c), itis objective and easy for an owner or operator to determine.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Sections 258.51-55 Overview of Ground-Water Monitoring Requirements</ITAG>Today's proposed Criteria revisions require a system of monitoring wellsto be installed at new and existing MSWLFs. The proposed Criteria revisionsalso provide procedures for sampling these wells and methods for statisticalanalysis of analytical data derived from the well samples to detect thepresence of hazardous constituents released from MSWLFs. The Agency isproposing a two-phased ground-water monitoring program and a correctiveaction program. This phased approach to ground-water monitoring allowsproper consideration of the transport characteristics of MSWLF leachatesin ground water, while protecting human health and the environment. Asshown in Figure 3, the proposed monitoring and corrective action programsprovide for a graduated response over time to the problem of ground-watercontamination as the evidence of such contamination increases, therebykeeping down costs.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration 2 889</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-C</ITAG>The proposal requires that all new and existing MSWLFs begin their ground-watermonitoring programs by complying with the Phase I monitoring requirements.When a change in ground-water chemistry is indicated by an increase ordecrease of two in more of parameters (1) to (15), or when any one of parameters(16) to (24) or the volatile organics (VOCs) listed in Appendix I is detectedat statistically significant levels above background, Phase II monitoringis triggered. Phase II requires monitoring an expanded list of hazardousconstituents (see Appendix II). If any of the Phase II parameters are detectedat statistically significant levels above background, the owner or operatormust compare those levels to the appropriate ground-water trigger levels.The State will set the ground-water trigger levels as specified in andSection;258.52. These ``trigger levels'' trigger the assessment of corrective measuresand establishment of the ground-water protection standard. Corrective actioncontinues until the owner or operator demonstrates compliance with theGWPS for a period of time determined by the State to be appropriate, basedon site-specific factors. The Agency is considering changing its SubtitleC requirements from a three-year period to one that is site-specific. EPArequests comment on the appropriateness of a minimum period of compliancefor Subtitle D.The Agency is proposing that ground-water monitoring, once initiated, continuethrough post-closure care. Adequate post-closure care is essential forcontinued protection of human health and the environment, and ground-watermonitoring is necessary in determining the effectiveness of post-closurecare. The Agency has not set minimum monitoring frequencies during thepost-closure period, instead leaving that determination entirely up tothe State. This decision was based on the idea that the appropriate frequencyat which to monitor during post closure will vary significantly not onlyamong units, but also over time. Site-specific information should be evaluatedby the State when determining post-closure monitoring frequency. Factorsthat should be considered by the State include the hydrogeology of thesite, the age and design of the landfill, and the operating history ofthe landfill. During the early years of post-closure care (e.g., 10 years),it may be appropriate to monitor as frequently as during the operatingperiod. In many cases it may be appropriate to lessen the frequency ofmonitoring in the latter years of post-closure care. If during post closurea unit triggers the next phase of ground-water monitoring, it would beappropriate for the State to set a monitoring frequency the same as theminimum frequency designated for the operating period.Comments are requested on whether individual monitoring wells at a landfillunit should be allowed to be in different phases of monitoring. The Agencyis not proposing this option today, but believes that this option couldbe appropriate in situations where the unit is very large, and only a fewmonitoring wells have triggered the next phase of monitoring. Once correctiveaction had been triggered in one well, however, all of the ground-watersurrounding the particular unit would be subject to corrective action provisions.<T3>a. andSection; 258.51 Ground-Water Monitoring Systems. </T3>Section 258.51of the proposed Criteria specifies requirements pertaining to appropriatemethods for constructing and placing ground-water monitoring wells. Thepurpose of these requirements is to ensure that consistent, reliable ground-watermonitoring systems are installed at all MSWLFs. The Agency has specifiedthe use of well systems because other technologies may not be as reliableas well systems for detecting changes in ground-water quality. In makingthis determination, the Agency reviewed many other methods of ground-watermonitoring, including resistivity, ground penetrating radar, and lysimeters.Detailed discussions of the strengths and weaknesses of these methods foruse in monitoring ground water at MSWLFs are provided in the backgrounddocument for Subpart E of today's proposal.The monitoring well system must be designed so as to monitor the performanceof the landfill design in terms of its ability to meet the design goal(as defined in andSection; 258.40(b)) in the aquifer at the waste managementunit boundary or the alternative boundary as specified by the State pursuantto andSection; 258.40. As such, well location is linked directly to the performancestandard for the design of the landfill unit. If the unit is designed tomeet the design goal at the waste management unit boundary, wells shouldbe installed at the waste management unit boundary. On the other hand,if the unit is designed to meet the design goal at an alternative boundary,the wells should be installed at the alternative boundary.Section 258.51 allows the placement of wells at the closest practical distancefrom the waste management unit or alternative boundary to account for thepresence of important structures, such as run-off controls, anchors forliners, and gas lines, that would be impaired or destroyed by well installationsin the area. Other factors can affect the exact placement of monitoringwells. In some hydrogeologic settings, perched water tables and/or otherhydrogeologic phenomena may cause leachate from an MSWLF to travel horizontallyfor a significant distance before reaching the uppermost aquifer. Therefore,andSection; 258.51(a) specifies that the State may select the closest practicaldistance downgradient from the waste management unit boundary or the alternativeboundary (as specified by the State) if the State determines, based onsite-specific hydrogeologic evaluations required in andSection; 258.51, thatthe uppermost aquifer would not be affected directly beneath the appropriateboundary by release of leachate from the MSWLF.In some cases, several discrete units may constitute the MSWLF. Becauseof topographic conditions and design limitations, constructing discretecells may be the only means of constructing a landfill on the property.Section 258.51(c) states that separate monitoring systems are not requiredfor each landfill unit at a multi-unit facility if the State approves thegrouping of units. Such approval would be allowed only if the multi-unitground-water monitoring system will be protective of human health and theenvironment. If local conditions make it infeasible or impractical to installa monitoring system around each landfill unit, the State may allow thegrouping of units within one monitoring system. Factors that the Stateshould consider when deciding whether more than one unit should be withina monitoring system include: the number of units, the spacing of the units,the orientation of the units to one another, the age of the units, andthe hydrogeologic setting. The State should not approve the grouping ofunits within one monitoring system if the downgradient portion of the systemwould be located more than 150 meters from any landfill unit.The Agency does not believe that there are any differences between MSWLFsand hazardous waste land disposal units with respect to the factors usedto determine appropriate types of well materials or well construction techniques.Therefore, today's proposed performance standards for ground-water monitoringsystem design found in andSection; 258.51(d) are similar to those specifiedfor hazardous waste disposal facilities in 40 CFR Part 264. This similarityensures consistent design and construction standards for monitoring wellsat all RCRA landfill facilities.Because hydrogeologic conditions vary widely from one site to another,it is not possible to establish requirements specifying the exact number,location, and depth of monitoring wells needed to adequately monitor groundwater in the aquifer. Such requirements are dependent on actual site-specificaquifer and geologic conditions. Therefore, in andSection; 258.51(e) theAgency has proposed that specifics of the system be based on aquifer thickness,flow rate, and flow direction, and the characteristics of the materialoverlying the aquifer. For example, a complex aquifer flow system may requiremultilevel wells to effectively monitor ground water. A facility locatedin an area of very low hydraulic gradient may be better monitored by aring of wells, since mounding could cause contaminant flow in all directions.<T3>b. Section 258.52 Determination of Ground-Water Trigger Level. </T3>Thissection discusses what procedures the State must follow when establishingappropriate trigger levels. Trigger levels must be established by the Statebefore the Phase I monitoring program is initiated. The levels establishedare health- and environmental-based levels that are determined by the Stateto be indicators for protection of human health and the environment. Whereappropriate, these levels are based on promulgated standards; otherwise,they are established by the State on the basis of general criteria describedbelow.Contamination exceeding trigger levels indicates a potential threat tohuman health or the environment that may require further study. Therefore,the owner or operator must conduct an assessment of corrective measureswhenever concentrations of hazardous constituents in the ground water exceedtrigger levels. Trigger levels provide the owner or operator a point ofreference for suggesting and supporting alternative remedies during theassessment of corrective measures (see preamble discussion for andSection;258.56). Trigger levels must be distinguished from ground-water protectionstandards, which are established during the remedy selection process.Under andSection; 258.52 of today's proposal, the concentration limits forthe trigger levels are: (1) Maximum contaminant levels promulgated underandSection; 1412 of the Safe Drinking Water Act, or (2) if an MCL has notbeen established, the concentration limit is a health-based limit establishedby the State that meets the proposed criteria described in andSection; 258.52(b)(2)(i-iv), or (3) if levels under (1) or (2) are not available, the concentrationlimit is a level established by the State that is an indicator for protectionof human health and the environment, or (4) background levels, if suchlevels are higher than concentrations under (1), (2), or (3), or if concentrationsunder (1), (2), or (3) have not been established.The MCLs are maximum concentrations of contaminants allowed in water usedfor drinking. They are based upon toxicity, treatment technologies, andother feasibility factors such as availability of analytical methods. TheMCLs are set following an analysis based on health considerations as guidedby the SDWA.The use of MCLs is consistent with current ground-water protection standardsunder 40 CFR Part 264, Subpart F (Releases from hazardous waste disposalfacilities). Under the 1986 Amendments to the SDWA, MCLs must be set for83 specific contaminants by 1989 as well as for any other contaminantsin drinking water that may have any adverse effect upon people's healthand that are known or anticipated to occur in public water systems. Currently,there are 28 MCLs promulgated; relevant MCLs to these requirements arelisted below in Table 2.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,xs42,r25,3.4</C><T4>Table </T4>2_<T4>Maximum Contaminant Levels</T4><H1>CAS No.</H1><H1>Chemical name</H1><H1>MCL (mg/L)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">7440-38-2<D>Arsenic</D><D>0.05</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7440-39-3<D>Barium</D><D>1.0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">71-43-2<D>Benzene</D><D>.005</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7440-43-9<D>Cadmium</D><D>.01</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">56-23-5<D>Carbon tetrachloride</D><D>.005</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1308-38-9<D>Chromium (III)</D><D>.05</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1333-82-0<D>Chromium (VI)</D><D>.05</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">106-46-7<D>para-Dichlorobenzene</D><D>.075</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">107-06-2<D>1,2-Dichloroethane</D><D>.005</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">75-35-4<D>1,2-Dichloroethylene</D><D>.007</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">72-20-8<D>Endrin</D><D>.0002</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7439-92-1<D>Lead</D><D>.05</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">58-89-9<D>Lindane</D><D>.004</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7439-97-6<D>Mercury</D><D>.002</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">72-43-5<D>Methoxychlor</D><D>.1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7782-49-2<D>Selenium</D><D>.01</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7440-22-4<D>Silver</D><D>.05</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">93-72-1<D>Silvex (2,4,5-TP)</D><D>.01</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">8001-35-2<D>Toxaphene</D><D>.005</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">71-55-6<D>1,1,1-Trichloroethane</D><D>.2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">79-01-6<D>Trichloroethylene</D><D>.005</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">75-01-4<D>Vinyl chloride</D><D>.002</D></ITAG></ITAG>The Agency is proposing that health-based concentrations established bythe State be used for the trigger level when MCLs are not available. Thesehealth-based levels must meet four criteria listed under andSection; 258.52(b)(2)(i-iv). First, they must be consistent with principles and procedures setforth in Agency guidelines for assessing the health risks of environmentalpollutants, which were promulgated on September 24, 1986 (51 FR 33992,34006, 34014, 34028).Second, the levels msut be based on scientifically valid studies conductedin accordance with the Toxic Substances Control Act Good Laboratory PracticeStandards (40 CFR Part 792) or other equivalent standards. The Good LaboratoryPractice Standards prescribe good laboratory practices for conducting studiesrelated to health effects, environmental effects, and chemical fate testingand are intended to assure quality data of integrity. In addition, theAgency guidelines for assessing the health risks of environmental pollutants(cited above) cite several publications that outline procedures for evaluatingstudies for scientific adequacy and statistical soundness. Third, for carcinogens,these levels must be associated with a risk level within the protectiverisk range. (See discussion in Section IX.D.1.a. of today's preamble concerningthe design goal and EPA's request for comment on alternative risk ranges.)Finally, for toxic chemicals that cause effects other than cancer or mutations,the levels must be equal to a concentration to which the human population(including sensitive subgroups) could be exposed on a daily basis withoutappreciable risk of deleterious effects during a lifetime. These criteriawill ensure that the trigger level represents valid and reasonable estimatesof levels in ground water that are safe for human consumption.Health-based levels that have undergone extensive Agency scientific review,but that have not been formally promulgated, are available for many chemicals.The four criteria proposed in andSection; 258.52 and discussed above willenable the State to use these nonpromulgated levels to derive trigger levels.Appendix III provided health-based levels that the Agency believes meetthese four criteria for selected hazardous constituents. These levels maybe used to determine trigger levels. EPA established these levels by anassessment process that evaluated the quality and weight-of-evidence ofsupporting toxicological, epidemiological, and clinical studies. Theselevels are discussed below.For noncarcinogens, health-based limits based on Reference Doses (RfDs)have been developed by the Agency's Risk Assessment forum. An RfD is anestimate of the daily exposure a sensitive individual can experience withoutappreciable risk of health effects during a lifetime. The experimentalmethod for estimating the RfD is to measure the highest test dose for asubstance that causes no statistically or biologically significant effectin an animal bioassay test. The RfD is derived by dividing the ``no observedadverse effect level'' (NOAEL) by a suitable scaling or uncertainty factor.Confidence in the RfD is dependent on a number of factors, including thequality and duration of the animal study. The derivation of RfDs has beenevaluated and verified by internal Agency review. Applying the standarddrinking water exposure assumptions (i.e., a 70 kg person drinks two litersof water a day for 70 years) to RfDs yields the ground-water concentrationlimit. Appendix III lists the RfDs (mg/kg-day) for several hazardous constituents.The use of the RfD is appropriate only for noncarcinogenic constituents.EPA science policy suggests that no threshold dose exists for carcinogens;in other words, no matter how small the dose, some risk remains. The dose-responseassessment for carcinogens usually entails an extrapolation from an experimentalhigh-dose range where carcinogenic effects in an animal bioassay have beenobserved, to a dose range where there are no observed experimental databy means of a preselected dose response model. The carcinogenic slope factors(CSFs), estimated by EPA's Carcinogen Assessment Group, may be used tocalculate a dose that corresponds to a given risk level by dividing therisk level (e.g., 1 x 10^6) by the CSF. CSFs for selected carcinogens areprovided in Appendix III. This dose is called a risk-specific dose (RSD).An RSD is an estimate of the daily dose of a carcinogen that, over a lifetime,will result in an incidence of cancer equal to a given risk level.The ground-water concentration, in milligrams per liter, can be calculatedby multiplying the RSD by the average adult body weight (70 kg) over theaverage water intake (two liters of water per day). Chemicals that causecancer also may evoke other toxic effects. These constituents may haveboth an RfD and RSD available. In these cases, the lower level (i.e., moreprotective) should be used as the trigger level.EPA has developed a classification scheme for carcinogens based on theweight of evidence for carcinogenicity. This scheme is presented in theAgency's cancer guidelines (51 FR 3992). Appendix III includes the classfor each carcinogen listed. Known or probable human carcinogens are designatedas Class A and Class B carcinogens, respectively, under the Agency guidelines.Constituents for which the weight of evidence of carcinogenicity is weakerare known as Class C, or possible human carcinogens under the Agency'sguidelines.Examples are included in Appendix III to illustrate how the States mayuse RfDs and CSFs to set trigger levels. For carcinogens, the State mayuse the CSF to determine a trigger level anywhere within the protectiverisk range. (See discussion in Section IX.D.1.a. of today's preamble concerningthe design goal and EPA's request for comment on alternative risk ranges.)The Agency believes that the protective risk range is appropriate for settinga trigger level for carcinogens without a MCL. For new MSWLFs, the Stateshould consider using the same risk level for trigger levels as was usedfor the design goal. For example, if the MSWLF was designed to meet a 1x 10^5 risk level at the chosen boundary, then the MSWLF should be triggeredinto an assessment of corrective measures once that risk level (for carcinogenswith no MCL) is exceeded. For existing MSWLFs, to ease implementation,the Agency suggests that the State choose one risk level to be used atan MSWLF for all carcinogens that do not have an MCL. The State may considerchoosing a risk level to use at all MSWLFs within the State. As discussedin the preamble discussion for the design goal, the Agency is requestingcomment on two alternatives to the protective risk range. Any change madeto the proposed design goal criteria would most likely be made for thetrigger level. For example, if a fixed risk level of 1 x 10^5 was requiredas a design goal, then the trigger levels for carcinogens without MCLswould also be required to be set at 1 x 10^5.RfDs and RSDs will be available soon through the Integrated Risk InformationSystem (IRIS), a computer-housed, electronically communicated catalogueof Agency risk assessment and risk management information for chemicalsubstances. IRIS is designed especially for Federal, State, and local environmentalhealth agencies as a source of the latest information about Agency healthassessments and regulatory decisions for specific chemicals. The risk assessmentinformation (i.e., RfDs and RSDs) contained in IRIS, except as specificallynoted, has been reviewed and agreed upon by intra-Agency review groups,and represents an Agency consensus. As EPA continues to review and verifyrisk assessment values, additional chemicals and data components will beadded to IRIS. A hard copy of IRIS soon will be available through the NationalTechnical Information Service. The background document for Subpart E containsfurther information on IRIS.If MCLs or other health-based levels meeting the proposed criteria arenot available or cannot be developed for use as trigger levels, andSection;258.52(b)(3) allows the State to establish a trigger level that acts asan indicator for protection of human health and the environment. In manycases, partial data or data on structural analogs will allow the Stateto estimate whether the detected level of a contaminant is likely to causea problem. In other cases, other contaminants will be present at high levels(triggering an assessment of corrective measures in any case), and it willbe clear that the constituent for which no level is available is not adriving factor in determining the risk at the site, even under worst-caseassumptions concerning its toxicity. In such cases, it may not be necessaryto specify a trigger level for that constituent.Finally, background concentrations may be used as the trigger level whenno health-based level or indicator is available or when background is higherthan any health-based level.<T3>c. Section 258.53 Ground-Water Sampling and Analysis.</T3> Section258.53 of today's proposed Criteria revisions includes requirements forconsistent sampling and analysis procedures that are designed to ensureaccurate ground-water monitoring results. Also included in this sectionare requirements for determining ground-water flow rate and direction,establishing background ground-water quality and applying appropriate statisticalanalyses to detect any changes in ground-water quality beneath an MSWLF.Section 258.53(a) requires that the sampling and analysis techniques usedby owners and operators of MSWLFs be sufficient to provide an accuraterepresentation of ground-water quality in the uppermost aquifer beneaththe landfill. At a minimum, these procedures must address sample collection,preservation, shipment, chain-of-custody, and quality assurance and qualitycontrol (QA/QC). The Agency recommends Chapter 2 of the ``RCRA TechnicalEnforcement Guidance Document'' (TEGD) for use in complying with this section.Although this chapter of the TEGD contains a number of references to thehazardous waste requirements under 40 CFR Part 264, the recommended samplingand analytical procedures are appropriate for any solid waste disposalfacilities, including MSWLFs. These recommendations provide clear descriptionsof how to conduct ground-water sampling and analysis and also allow theuse of alternate procedures on a site-specific basis. Therefore, by recommendingthe TEGD, the Agency is not ignoring the use of alternate procedures thatare consistent with the level of performance reflected in the TEGD.In the RCRA Subtitle C program, the Agency has observed problems with ground-watersampling procedures, monitoring well network design, laboratory analyses,and data interpretation. EPA believes that a rigorously enforced, comprehensivequality assurance program based on sound quality objectives and backedup with an appropriate set of reference methods and procedural guidancewill assist in remedying these problems. As a result, the Agency is consideringadding QA/QC requirements to the sampling and analytical methods for SubtitleC facilities under andSection; 264.97(e). To avoid duplicating the problemsof Subtitle C, andSection; 258.53(a)(5) of today's proposal requires thatQA/QC procedures be included in sampling and analysis techniques. Ownersor operators should refer to EPA guidance on ``Test Methods for EvaluatingSolid Waste (Physical/Chemical Methods)'' for information on QA/QC procedures(Ref. 34).Section 258.53(d) of today's proposal requires that ground-water elevationsbe measured immediately prior to sampling. In addition, the owner or operatormust determine the rate and direction of ground-water flow in the uppermostaquifer each time ground-water gradient changes. These requirements fordetermining ground-water flow rate and direction are included to ensurethat any unexpected changes in these parameters will be recognized andthat changes in the location or spacing of monitoring wells will be madeas needed to maintain the integrity of ground-water monitoring systems.Ground-water flow rates and directions may vary seasonally or over a numberof years due to human-made or natural causes and, because the spacing andlocation of wells are highly dependent on these parameters, the Agencyhas decided not to rely entirely on the measurements of these parametersmade prior to well installation. In selecting a site-specific frequency,i.e., tied to changes in ground-water gradient, the Agency has attemptedto strike a balance between areas where aquifers exhibit no variabilityand those that exhibit frequent changes in flow rate and direction. Atfacilities that overlie aquifers with little or no variability in gradient,these assessments may be fairly infrequent. At facilities overlying aquiferswith more variable ground-water gradients, more frequent assessments offlow rate and direction may be required, based on measurements of piezometricsurface taken at least semiannually. Ground-water flow rate and directiondata should be presented in the form of a flow net.Today's proposed ground-water sampling and analysis procedures also includerequirements for establishing background ground-water quality. Informationon background ground-water quality is essential for determining whetherthe presence of monitoring parameters or constituents beneath an MSWLFindicates leakage from the landfill unit. Section 258.53(e) requires theowner or operator to establish background values for those monitoring parametersor constituents included in the monitoring phase applicable to that MSWLF.For example, if the MSWLF currently is in the Phase I monitoring program,background values must be established for all of the Phase I parameters.Background values of all of the Phase II parameters must be establishedif Phase II monitoring is triggered. The minimum number of background samplesneeded to fulfill the statistical requirements will depend on the statisticalprocedures selected.Background ground-water quality must be established in wells that are hydraulicallyupgradient of the MSWLF, except as allowed in andSection;andSection; 258.53(f) and (g). Section 258.53(f) states that background quality at landfillunits may be based on samples from wells that are not upgradient from thelandfill if hydrogeologic conditions do not allow the owner or operatorto determine what wells are upgradient, and sampling at other wells willprovide an indication of background ground-water quality that is as representativeor more representative than that provided by upgradient wells. Areas withno hydraulic gradient and those with reversing hydraulic gradient (suchas those influenced by tides) are examples of hydrogeologic conditionsthat could make it impossible to determine which direction is upgradient.Section 258.53(g) of today's proposal gives the State flexibility in determiningbackground ground-water quality on a site-specific basis where such levelscannot be measured on the facility. An example of such a situation wouldbe a landfill unit that is leaking and causing a mounding effect (whereleachate is flowing out of the unit in all directions). If the leachateflowed far enough from the unit, it could contaminate all of the groundwater between the unit and the property boundary, thus leaving no uncontaminatedground water from which to determine background ground-water quality. TheState would be able to set background values for this site. Backgroundground-water quality should be based on actual monitoring data from theaquifer of concern. A State may have well data from another landfill sitethat overlies the same aquifer, or the data may be from another type ofwell from which the State can obtain data. The reader is referred to thebackground document for Subpart E for a full discussion of this provision.The requirements for applying the statistical procedures contained in andSection;258.53(h)are the same as the procedures proposed on August 24, 1987, for hazardouswaste disposal facilities under Subtitle C of RCRA (see 52 FR 31948). TheAgency believes that the revised Subtitle C procedures are also appropriatefor MSWLFs and provide sufficient flexibility to allow effective Stateimplementation at MSWLFs. The final statistical procedures promulgatedunder andSection; 258.53(h) will reflect comments received on this proposalas well as the final statistical package promulgated under Part 264.The required statistical procedures for comparing background ground-waterquality data to those samples taken at downgradient wells are includedin today's Criteria revisions to clarify the purpose and timing of statisticalcomparisons and their relation to ground-water sampling events at MSWLFs.These requirements ensure that statistical comparisons of analytical resultsbetween background and downgradient monitoring wells will be made promptlyafter each sampling event, and will cover all applicable parameters andconstituents at MSWLFs. For further discussion of the statistical requirements,the reader is referred to the preamble for the proposed Subtitle C proceduresfound at 52 FR 31948.<T3>d. Section 258.54 Phase I Monitoring Requirements. </T3>The Phase Imonitoring parameters proposed today in andSection; 258.54 were developedwith the dual objectives of providing a reliable means of detecting thepossible presence of releases from MSWLFs while avoiding unnecessary analyticalcosts to the regulated community. The proposed list of Phase I parametersis consistent with the results of research conducted under the directionof EPA's Office of Research and Development and other institutions. Theseresearch results reveal that Phase I parameters (1)-(15) are reliable indicatorsof ground-water chemistry and possible precursors to other more hazardousconstitutents that may be released later from MSWLFs. Furthermore, Statestypically require routine monitoring of one or more of these parameters(1) to (15) at MSWLFs as the primary means of detecting ground-water contamination.The major cations and anions on the Phase I parameter list are those usedto classify ground water into geochemical facies. These parameters are,therefore, useful for tracking changes in the ground-water geochemistrythat may occur as the result of leakage from an MSWLF. In addition, theAgency is proposing to require semiannual monitoring for the metals (arsenic,barium, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury, selenium, and silver), cyanide,and 46 VOCs.The Agency believes that these VOCs in Appendix I constitute the firstgroup of potentially hazardous constituents that would be present in theground water prior to other, less mobile, constituents proposed for PhaseII (see Appendix II of the proposed rule.) Due to their chemical nature,these VOCs generally would not migrate any faster than the non-VOC PhaseI parameters, but do migrate faster than most of the Phase II constituents.Research by EPA and other institutions that supports these statements issummarized in the background document to this Subpart.Heavy metals and cyanide also can exist under certain conditions in a well-definedleachate ground-water plume, depending on the waste present in the landfill.It is not certain whether heavy metal concentration would be as significantin leachate plumes from newer MSWLFs as they tend to be attenuated morethan other constituents, such as VOCs. MSWLF leachates containing heavymetals can, however, pose serious threats to human health and to aquaticenvironments; therefore, the Agency is proposing to include the heavy metalsthat are included in the primary drinking water standards along with cyanideand the VOCs as the minimum Phase I monitoring parameters. The reader is referred to the background document for this Subpart formore information.The Agency is proposing to include the following as the minimum Phase Iparameters that must be monitored for at least semiannually:<ITAG tagnum="15">(1) Ammonia (as N)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(2) Bicarbonate (HCO</ITAG><T2>3</T2>)<ITAG tagnum="15">(3) Calcium</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(4) Chloride</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(5) Iron</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(6) Magnesium</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(7) Manganese (dissolved)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(8) Nitrate (as N)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(9) Postassium</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(10) Sodium</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(11) Sulfate</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(12) Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(13) Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(14) Total Organic Carbon (TOC)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(15) pH</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(16) Arsenic</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(17) Barium</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(18) Cadmium</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(19) Chromium</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(20) Cyanide</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(21) Lead</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(22) Mercury</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(23) Selenium</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(24) Silver</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(25) Volatile Organic Compounds listed in Appendix I</ITAG>The Agency specifically requests comment on the proposed set of Phase Imonitoring parameters and the monitoring frequency. EPA is proposing thatthe frequency of monitoring during Phase I be determined by consideringaquifer flow rates in the vicinity of the monitoring wells and the resourcevalue of the aquifer. Semiannual sampling is proposed as a minimum frequencyduring the active life and closure of a unit. This frequency also is theminimum specified in the ground-water monitoring requirements (40 CFR Part264) for hazardous waste landfills. The Agency believes that a six-monthmaximum interval between sampling events is reasonable in terms of protectionof human health and the environment and the burden on the regulated community.During post-closure care, a State may set a different minimum monitoringfrequency. Today's proposal does not set a minimum frequency for ground-water monitoringduring post-closure care. Because of the variable length of the post-closurecare period and the variability of site-specific conditions, the Agencybelieves it is more appropriate to allow States to determine the frequencyof ground-water monitoring on a site-specific basis. Section 258.54(d) states that a Phase I ground-water monitoring programmust be expanded to Phase II ground-water monitoring when two or more ofthe parameters (1) to (15) are detected at levels that significantly differfrom background levels. Because the parameters (1) to (15) are monitoredto detect changes in ground-water chemistry beneath an MSWLF, both increasesand decreases in these parameters may be significant. The Agency is notimplying that decreased levels of any of these parameters indicate degradationof ground water, just that further monitoring should be done to determinewhat is causing the change in ground-water chemistry. For example, a changein water chemistry, such as a decrease in pH and sulfate, may indicatethe release of liquids from a landfill. The Agency is proposing to useincreases or decreases of any two or more of the parameters (1) to (15)to trigger Phase II monitoring because preliminary analysis of ground-watersamples taken at MSWLFs show that: (1) Substantiated leachate contaminationof ground water from MSWLFs normally involves more than one of those PhaseI parameters and (2) levels of a single one of those Phase I parametersin backgroud ground-water samples in some areas of the country are highlyvariable, which could lead to false indications of contamination. Section258.55(a) states that if anyone of parameters (16) to (24) or the VOCslisted in Appendix I is detected at levels that are statistically significantabove background, the unit must begin Phase II monitoring. During PhaseII monitoring, the owner and operator has the opportunity to revert backto Phase I monitoring if it is found that there has not been a statisticallysignificant increase over background levels of relevant parameters (seeandSection; 258.55(e)). Once an MSWLF has triggered Phase II monitoring, the owner or operatoris not required to monitor parameters (1) to (15). States may require anowner or operator who has entered a Phase II monitoring program to continueoccasional monitoring for parameters (1) to (15), particularly if thatState has established corrective action requirements that involve thoseparameters. The Agency does not intend to require any corrective actionfor Phase I parameters (1) to (15) because: (1) It is not apparent thatthese parameters would ever occur at high levels without correspondingincreases over background levels for many of the constitutents listed inAppendix II of the proposed regulations, (2) it is difficult to assigna target level for cleanup of the non-VOC, nonmetal Phase I parameters,since none of them are hazardous to human health at levels found in MSWLFleachate, and (3) cleanup of any Appendix II constituents is likely toresult in concurrent cleanup of the other Phase I parameters to acceptablelevels. Section 358.54(d)(3) of today's proposal allow the MSWLF owner or operatorto demonstrate that detection of significant changes in ground-water qualityduring Phase I monitoring was caused by sampling and analytical error orby a source other than the MSWLF. The Agency included this provision intoday's proposal because it is known that sampling and analytical errorsare made with sufficient frequency that they cannot be ignored. This provisionavoids unnecessary costs to the owner or operator who would otherwise berequired to begin Phase II monitoring. Furthermore, this provision is consistentwith the RCRA Subtitle C regulations governing hazardous waste landfills.Owners or operators of MSWLFs attempting to make this demonstration mustnotify the State of their intent, submit the demonstration to the Statein the form of a report, and continue the Phase I monitoring program. Ifthe demonstration is not successful, the owner or operator must establisha Phase II monitoring program within a reasonable time period. The Agency specifically requests comments on the list of Phase I monitoringparameters, methods for setting triggering mechanisms, and potential requiredactions at MSWLFs that are contaminating ground water only with non-VOC,nonmetal parameters (1) to (15) Phase I constituents. The Agency also requestsinformation about any MSWLFs that are known to be causing significant contaminationof ground water with only non-VOC, nonmetal Phase I constituents. <T3>e. Section 258.55 Phase II Monitoring Requirements. </T3>If it is determinedthat the ground water contains significant increases (or decreases) overbackground levels of Phase I parameters, the Phase II monitoring programis triggered. The purpose of this phase of ground-water monitoring is todetermine the concentration of hazardous constituents specified in AppendixII of today's proposal. Therefore, Phase II monitoring is initiated bysampling all wells and analyzing each sample for all of the constituentslisted in Appendix II of today's proposal. Triggering into Phase II does not necessarily indicate a threat to humanhealth and the environment. Rather, entering Phase II monitoring signalsthe need to more fully analyze ground water to determine if any constituenthas exceeded health-based levels (i.e., trigger levels). The technicalbasis for selection of the Appendix II parameters for Phase II monitoringis presented below and in the background document for Subpart E of today'sproposal.The Agency's major objective on identifying the constituents forPhase II monitoring was to include those hazardous constituents that poserisk to human health and the environment, are present in MSWLF leachate,and may potentially migrate to ground water. The proposed constituents(Appendix II of today's proposal) are the same as those used for the GWPSat hazardous waste disposal facilities under Subtitle C of RCRA. The Agencyconsidered several options for the specific list of Phase II constituents.The regulatory alternatives included: (1) The list of constituents in thecurrent Subtitle D Criteria, (2) the list of priority pollutants, (3) alist of all constituents that have been found in MSWLF leachates, (4) asite-specific list of constituents, based on analyses of leachate samples,and (5) the list of constituents in Appendix II. The first option the Agency considered was the 10 inorganic chemicals,four chlorinated hydrocarbons, and two chlorophenoxys specified in thecurrent Criteria (40 CFR Part 257). This option was rejected because theAgency's analytical leachate data indicate the presence of numerous othertoxic organic compounds that would not be addresed by this option. The second option considered was the list of priority pollutants undersection 307(a)(1) of the CWA. The constituents on this list are toxic,and many have been found in leachate samples from MSWLFs. Because the listfails to include many constituents that have been detected in MSWLF leachate,however, the priority pollutant list was rejected for use as the GWPS.The Agency considered a third option of developing a new list of constituentsfor Phase II monitoring at MSWLFs. The new list would have been compiledfrom existing data on the types of toxic compounds that have been detectedin leachate samples from MSWLFs. EPA's current data on MSWLF leachate arelimited but indicate the tremendous range of constituents and concentrationsthat may be found in MSWLF leachate. Altogether, data were received for59 landfills, with 37 landfills providing both organic and inorganic leachateanalyses, 7 landfills providing only organic analysis, and 15 landfillsproviding only inorganic analysis. Sixty-four hazardous organic constituentswere identified as well as 49 hazardous inorganic constituents and otherparameters. In most cases, the list of constituents analyzed for was unknown,so these data may not indicate the full range of constituents that maybe found in the leachate even from these MSWLFs. Thus, this option wasrejected because of data limitation, particularly for hazardous organicconstituents.The fourth option the Agency considered was developing site-specific PhaseII monitoring constituents through the analysis of leachate samples fromeach MSWLF. This approach would allow owners and operators of MSWLFs tolimit their analyses to only those hazardous constituents present in theleachate of their landfill. The Agency has the following concerns withthis approach: (1) It is unworkable for sites with no leachate collectionsystem (including the majority of existing landfills), (2) it does notaccount for degradation processes occurring during constituent migrationthrough the unsaturated zone and ground water, and (3) it would requireperiodic resampling of the leachate to account for the wide variationsin leachate quality over time. The Agency is interested in comments onthe efficacy of this approach for facilities that have leachate collectionsystems. The option adopted in today's proposal was to use the Appendix II constituents.Sixty-nine of the constituents in Appendix II have been found in MSWLFleachate. This number is based on limited data, particularly for hazardousorganic constituents. In examining the variability of substances appearingin landfill leachate samples and all the potential waste streams that maybe placed in MSWLFs, the Agency has concluded that any of the AppendixII constituents potentially could be present in ground water beneath anMSWLF at levels that may pose threats to human health and the environment.The Agency requests comments on the constituents proposed for Phase IImonitoring at MSWLFs.Section 258.55(c) requires the MSWLF owner or operator to sample the groundwater in all monitoring wells and determine which, if any, of the AppendixII constituents are present in the ground water at concentrations thatsignificantly exceed background levels. This activity must be done within90 days after triggering Phase II. If the owner or operator concludes onthe basis of the Appendix II constituent scan that none of the constituentssignificantly exceed background levels, pursuant to andSection; 258.54(d),the State must determine the frequency for any subsequent Appendix II constituentscans to be conducted at the MSWLF during the active life or post-closurecare.Section 258.55(e) of today's proposal allows MSWLFs to revert to a previousphase of ground-water monitoring after the owner or operator determinesthat there has not been a statistically significant increase over the backgroundlevels of the relevant monitoring parameters. This proposal is similarto changes being considered for ground-water monitoring under SubtitleC of RCRA, and is particularly applicable to Subtitle D, under which thepracticable capability of the owner or operator can be considered. TheAgency realizes that it can be very difficult to prove that error in samplingor analysis caused the indication of a statistically significant increaseabove background levels of a ground-water monitoring parameter. If suchan error were to occur and could not be proven to be the cause, a unitwould be triggered into a higher and more costly phase of ground-watermonitoring. The owner or operator would be forced to pay for a more costlymonitoring program for an indefinite time period, with no added benefitto human health or the environment. Allowing a unit to revert to a previousphase of monitoring when no constituents have been detected above backgroundlevels eases the financial burden of the owner or operator without harminghuman health or the environment. A specific time period over which monitoringmust be conducted before reverting to a previous monitoring phase has notbeen proposed, based on the concept that the appropriate time period shouldbe site-specific. A minimum time period also was not proposed, but theAgency requests comments on the appropriateness of a minimum time period.It should be noted that the criterion for returning to Phase I monitoring(i.e., background levels for Appendix II constituents) is consistent withthose for facilities that have never entered Phase II monitoring. Therefore,an MSWLF may not return to Phase I monitoring merely by maintaining concentrationlevels at the trigger levels that initiate corrective measures assessment.Instead, before returning to Phase I monitoring, the concentration levelsfor Appendix II constituents must be at or below the background, whichis the level that initiates phase II monitoring for a reasonable time perioddetermined by the State.If any Appendix II constituents are detected at statistically significantlevels above background, andSection; 258.55(f) requires the owner or operatorof the MSWLF to notify the State of this fact in writing within 14 days;and, within 90 days of the finding, he or she must submit to the Statea report containing all data necessary for establishing a ground-watertrigger level.Section 258.55(f)(2) of today's proposal requires that each hazardous constituentthat is present at levels exceeding background concentrations must be analyzedfrom ground-water samples taken on a quarterly basis. The Agency believesthat the presence of hazardous constituents over background signals theneed for a more thorough assessment of the ground-water condition, necessitatingmore frequent monitoring than for Phase I. Thus, the Agency is proposingquarterly monitoring at a minimum to provide the earliest possible indicationof when the trigger level has been excceeded. This approach is consistentwith the approach taken in other Agency ground-water monitoring programs,such as under Subtitle C of RCRA. More frequent monitoring may be requiredby the State depending on site-specific conditions, such as ground-waterflow rates and directions. The Agency considered alternatives that wouldrequire more stringent minimum frequencies, but these alternatives wouldhave been unnecessarily burdensome at sites where ground water travelsa distance of only a few feet per year. Therefore, today's proposed minimumfrequency balances the need for early detection and thorough assessmentwith the statutory need to consider the ``practicable capability'' of theregulated community.In addition to the quarterly monitoring for those constituents exceedingbackground, andSection; 258.55(d) requires that each MSWLF monitor otherPhase II constituents (Appendix II constituents) on a periodic basis todetermine if any additional constituents have entered the ground waterat concentrations that significantly exceed background levels. The frequencyfor monitoring these other Phase II constituents is determined by the State.These periodic analyses are essential for use in determining whether thedesign of an ongoing corrective action program must be changed to accommodatethe treatment or removal of additional constituents. The Agency consideredrequiring annual Appendix II analyses at all MSWLFs, but the Agency believesselecting an appropriate frequency based on site-specific factors is essentialgiven that Phase II constituent analyses may approach $3,000 per sample.The ``practicable capability'' of the owner or operator needs to be considered.The Agency's decision to allow State determination of the frequency forperiodic Appendix II analyses also is based on the fact that site-specificconditions will have a significant impact on the release of any new constituentsto the ground water from an MSWLF. The State also must determine the frequencyfor Phase II constituent analyses during post-closure care for those constituentsthat have exceeded background concentrations. Under andSection;258.55(g), if the periodic analyses of Appendix II constituentreveals additional constituents in the ground water that are present atabove-background levels, the owner or operator must notify the State within14 days and, within 90 days, must submit a report on the concentrationsof these new constituents. The MSWLF also must begin monitoring these newconstituents at the minimum quarterly rate, which is required for all PhaseII parameters that have exceeded background levels. Under andSection;258.55(h),if any Phase II parameters are detected at concentrations that exceed theground-water trigger level, the MSWLF owner or operator must notify theState of this finding within 14 days. The owner or operator of the MSWLFalso must begin to assess corrective measures as required under andSection;258.56and continue to follow the Phase II monitoring program requirements.  The proposed Phase II monitoring requirements under andSection;258.55(h)(4)allow the owner or operator to demonstrate that an increase over the ground-watertrigger level was caused by a sampling or analytical error or by a sourceother than the MSWLF. The rationale for including this demonstration intoday's proposal is provided under the discussion of the Phase I monitoringprogram in this preamble.  <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Section 258.56 Assessment of Corrective Measures  </ITAG>An assessment of corrective measures is required whenever concentrationsof hazardous constitutents in the ground water exceed trigger levels. Triggerlevels are health- and environmental-based levels established by the Stateas indicators for protection of human health and the environment (see preamblediscussion for andSection;258.52).  The State shall specify the scope of the corrective measures study. Factorsthat generally may be appropriate are listed in andSection;258.56(c). Thepurpose of the assessment is to study potential corrective measures. Ingeneral, the extensiveness of the assessment (i.e., the number and typeof alternatives evaluated) should be commensurate with the complexity ofthe site. (The reader is directed to the Background Document for SubpartE for a more detailed discussion of what may be appropriate for specificsituations.) There may be some situations where a limited assessment isappropriate. For example, if the ground water is known to be Class IIIground water (see preamble discussion for andSection;258.57(f)(2)) and remediationwill not be required, the assessment may be limited to an evaluation ofinstitutional-type controls to limit exposure.  Under andSection;258.56(c), the Agency specifies several activities thatthe State may include in the scope of the assessment. First, the Statemay require the owner or operator to assess the effectiveness of potentialremedies in meeting the requirements and objectives of the remedy (fora discussion of these requirements and objectives, see the preamble discussionfor andSection;258.57 (b) and (c)). Next, the State may require the owneror operator to perform an evaluation of the performance, reliability, easeof implementation, and impacts (including safety, intermedia contaminanttransfer, and control of exposures to residual contamination) associatedwith any potential remedy evaluated. In evaluating the performance of eachremedy, the owner or operator should evaluate the appropriateness of specificremedial technologies to the contamination problem being addressed. Duringthis assessment, the owner or operator may need to conduct additional monitoringto characterize the nature and extent of the plume of contamination.  Analysis of a remedy's performance, reliability, and ease of implementationmay include an assessment of its effectiveness in achieving intended functionsof containment, treatment, remediation, or disposal of the hazardous constituentsand the degree of protection afforded human health and the environment.In addition, consideration should be given to the frequency and complexityof necessary operation and maintenance and the extent to which the technologyhas been successfully demonstrated under analogous conditions. The technicalfeasibility for the remedial strategy should also be considered in termsof ability to construct and operate the remedial technologies and the availabilityof necessary treatment, storage, or disposal services, and capacity.  The Agency is particularly concerned about potential cross-media impacts(intermedia transfer of contaminants) of remedies, and, therefore, theAgency specifically identified them as an area that the State may requirethe owner or operator to consider. Some remedial technologies may causesecondary impacts. For example, in some circumstances, air stripping ofVOCs from ground water may release these VOCs to the air unless specificemissions control devices are installed on the air stripper.  In today's proposal, the State also may require the owner or operator toevaluate the timing of the potential remedy (andSection;258.56(c)(3)), includingconstruction, start-up, and completion time. Timing will be important indistinguishing among remedies. The State ultimately determines the complianceschedule for final cleanup of the ground water under andSection;258.57(d). The owner or operator may be required by the State to include cost estimatesfor alternatives considered (andSection;258.56(c)(4)). Cost estimates willbe very important to the State when approving the selected remedy. Thepracticable capabilities of the facility, including the capability to financeand manage a corrective action program may be considered by the State indetermining the duration of the clean-up. Therefore, the cost of the remedymay affect the remedy selected and the timing of the cleanup (see preamblediscussion of andSection;258.57(d)).  The owner or operator may be required to consider institutional requirementsunder andSection;258.56(c)(5). For example, local governments may have specificrequirements related to the remedial activities that may affect implementationof the remedies evaluated.  Finally, the State may require the owner or operator to evaluate the publicacceptability of alternatives. The consideration of community concernsis a decision factor that the State will use in selecting a remedy (seeandSection;258.57(c)(5)).  Under the proposed andSection;258.56(d), the State may require the owneror operator to evaluate one or more specific potential remedies. Thesepotential remedies may include innovative technologies. The State may knowof technologies that have been successful at other landfills with similarcontamination problems. The proposed andSection;258.56(e) requires that,after all remedies have been evaluated, the owner or operator must submita report to the State on the assessments so that the State may choose whichremedy should be implemented.  Under proposed andSection;258.56(f), if the State determines at any timethat human health or the environment are being threatened by the releaseof hazardous constituents from the MSWLF, the State may require the owneror operator to implement the measures required in proposed andSection;258.58(a)(3) or (a)(4) (see preamble discussion of andSection;258.58(a)).  <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Section 258.57 Selection of Remedy and Establishment of Ground-WaterProtection Standard  </ITAG>The proposed andSection;258.57 outlines the general requirements for selectionof remedies for MSWLFs. As structured, it establishes four basic standardsthat all remedies must meet and specifies decision criteria that will beconsidered by the State in selecting the most appropriate remedy. In addition,decision factors for setting schedules for initiating and completing remediesare outlined, and specific requirements for establishing ground-water protectionstandards, including requirements for achieving compliance with them, arecontained in this section.  Proposed andSection;258.57(b) specifies that all remedies must: Be protectiveof human health and the environment; attain ground-water protection standardsas specified pursuant to andSection;258.57 (e) and (f); control the sourcesof releases so as to reduce or eliminate, to the maximum extent practicable,further releases that may pose a threat to human health or the environment;and comply with standards for management of wastes as specified in andSection;258.58(d). These standards reflect the major technical components of remedies: cleanupof releases, source control, and appropriate management of wastes thatare generated by remedial activities. The first standard_protection ofhuman health and the environment_is a general mandate derived from theRCRA statute. This overarching standard requires remedies to include thosemeasures that are needed to be protective, but are not directly relatedto ground-water protection, source control, or management of wastes. Anexample would be a requirement to provide alternate drinking water suppliesin order to prevent exposure to releases to ground water used for drinkingwater. Another example would be barriers or other controls to prevent directcontact with the unit.  Remedies will be required to attain the ground-water protection standardsthat will be specified for the remedy by the State according to the requirementsoutlined below. The GWPS for a remedy often will play a large role in determiningthe extent of and technical approaches to the remedy. In some cases, certaintechnical aspects of the remedy, such as the practicable capabilities ofremedial technologies, may influence to some degree the GWPS that are established.It is because of this interplay between cleanup standards and other remedygoals and limitations that today's rule establishes requirements for GWPSwithin the overall remedy selection structure of andSection;258.57. Thus,the standard setting process and the remedy selection process occur concurrentlywith both processes affecting the other.    Section andSection; 258.57(b)(3) is the source control standard for remedies.A critical objective of remedies must be to reduce further environmentaldegradation by controlling or eliminating further releases that may posea threat to human health and the environment. In some cases, unless sourcecontrol measures are taken, efforts to clean up releases may be ineffective.EPA is persuaded that effective source control actions are an essentialpart of ensuring the effectiveness and protectiveness of corrective actionsat MSWLFs.The standard of andSection; 258.57(b)(3) requires that further releases fromsources of contamination that may pose a threat to human health or theenvironment be controlled to the ``maximum extent practicable.'' This qualifieris intended to account for the practicable capabilities of the owner oroperator and the technical limitations that may, in some cases, be encounteredin achieving source controls. For some very large MSWLFs. engineering solutionssuch as treatment or capping to prevent further leaching may not be technicallyfeasible or completely effective in eliminating further releases abovehealth-based contamination levels. In such cases, source control may needto be combined with other measures, such as plume management or exposurecontrols, to be an effective and protective remedy.The Agency does not intend this source control requirement to disrupt solidwaste disposal at operating MSWLFs that have contaminated ground water.The Agency believes that, until the MSWLF is closed with an appropriatefinal cover (pursuant to andSection; 258.40), other effective measures maybe implemented. For example, depending on the source(s) of the release(s),capping inactive cells or units may help to control further releases. Asmentioned above, plume management and exposure controls also may be needed,especially while the facility is continuing to receive waste. The concept of effective source control as a remedial objective, as expressedby this remedy standard in andSection; 258.57(b)(3), is closely linked tothe CERCLA preference for Superfund remedial actions that utilize ``permanentsolutions and alternative treatment technologies or resource recovery technologiesto the maximum extent practicable.''The proposed remedy standard of andSection; 258.57(b)(4) requires that remedialactivities that involve management of wastes must comply with the requirementsfor solid waste management, as specified in andSection; 258.58(d) in today'sproposed rule. Remedies may involve treatment, storage, or disposal ofwastes, particularly in the context of source control actions. This standardwill ensure that management of wastes during remedial activities will beconducted in a protective manner. The Agency requests comment on the fourproposed standards for remedies.Proposed andSection; 258.57(c) specifies general factors to be consideredby the State in selecting a remedy that meets the four standards for remedies.These factors, which generally are consistent with the evaluation criteriaspecified in SARA, are discussed briefly below. The Agency requests commenton these factors.These factors are meant to aid the States in evaluating the data providedby the owner or operator as a result of the assessment of corrective measures.The general decision factors are: (1) Long- and short-term effectivenessand protectiveness, (2) reduction of future releases, (3) implementability,(4) practicable capability of the owner or operator, and (5) communityconcerns. The first two factors described under andSection; 258.57(c) are directlylinked to the standards for the remedy. The long- and short-term effectivenessand protectiveness of the remedy is a measure of whether human health andthe environment will be protected while the remedy is being implementedand once it is completed. It also is a measure of whether the GWPS canbe met. The second factor, the reduction of future releases, should beused in evaluating how well the source control standard has been met. Thepracticable capability of the owner or operator also may be consideredwhen evaluating to what extent source control can be achieved. The Agency believes that the implementability of potential remedies alsomust be considered by the State when evaluating remedies. Factors thatmay affect the implementability of a remedy included: (1) The degree ofdifficulty associated with constructing the technology, (2) the expectedoperational reliability of the technologies, (3) the availability of necessaryequipment and specialists, and (4) the available capacity and locationof needed treatment, storage, and disposal services. The practicable capability of the owner or operator is another remedy selectionfactor. As described elsewhere in this preamble, practicable capabilityincludes both economic and technical capability of the owner or operator.The consideration of practicable capability allows the State to choosethe remedy or combination of remedies that can meet the overall goal ofprotection of human health and the environment. This may affect the timingof corrective action, and, therefore, practicable capability has been listedas a factor for the States to consider in establishing the cleanup timeframe (see preamble discussion of andSection; 258.57(d)). In addition, asmentioned previously, the practicable capability of the owner or operatormay be considered by the State in defining to what extent the source ofreleases will be controlled. Community concerns is another factor that the Agency believes must be consideredby the State when selecting a remedy. It is very important that the communityhas confidence in the remedy, how it was chosen, and the party responsiblefor implementation. The success of the corrective action process with regardto community involvement may significantly affect the siting of futureMSWLFs in that community.Any remedy proposal developed during the assessment of corrective measurespresented to the State for final remedy selection must, at a minimum, meetthe four standards of andSection; 258.57(b). The State then will evaluatethose remedies. The decision factors discussed above will be used by theState in selecting the appropriate remedy. The relative weight given toany one of the factors will vary from facility to facility. For example,short-term effectiveness considerations may be of particular concern whereremedial activities will be conducted in densely populated areas, or wherewaste characteristics are such that risks to workers are high and specialprotective measures are needed. Implementability factors will often playa substantial role in shaping remedies_some technologies will require Stateor local permits prior to construction, which may increase the time neededto implement the remedy.Proposed andSection; 258.57(d) would require the State to specify a schedulefor initiating and completing remedial activities as a part of the selectionof remedy process. This provision gives the States the flexibility to prioritizeMSWLF cleanups within their borders. The Agency believes that the flexibilitythese factors (described below) allow is essential considering the practicablecapability of many MSWFs. Further, the Agency believes that the use ofthese factors will not in any way compromise protection of human healthor the environment.The Agency is proposing that the State consider numerous factors in determiningthe cleanup time frame. First, threats to human health or the environmentfrom exposure to contamination during implementation of the correctiveaction program must be considered. Ground-water cleanup should be hastenedif protection of human health and the environment cannot be ensured. Currentground-water users and actual or potential ecological damages must be identified.Second, the extent and nature of the contamination should be consideredto determine what remedies and time frames are technically feasible. The resource value of the contaminated aquifer is a third factor. Resourcevalue is broadly defined as the value of the aquifer as a current and futurewater supply for domestic, industrial, agricultural, and other beneficialuses. This provision allows the States to balance the resource value ofthe affected ground water against the corrective action costs to determinethe corrective action time period. States then can determine and require,at a minimum, that owners or operators implement the combination of replacementand corrective actions that most efficiently address the short- and long-termprotection of human health and the environment. When evaluating the resourcevalue of the aquifer, States should consider the value of the regionalaquifer, not just the value of the portion of the aquifer affected by thefacility. In addition, local values with respect to maintaining uncontaminatedaquifers should be considered. A fourth factor to be used by the state in determining the corrective actiontime period is the availability of treatment or disposal capacity for anywaste managed during the corrective action program. Capacity should beensured before removal or treatment of the wastes or ground water begins.In addition to ensuring capacity, the owner or operator must also ensurethat wastes will be managed in compliance with requirements in andSection;258.58(d).The fifth and sixth factors concern remedial technologies. New and innovativecorrective action technologies are being investigated continually and itmay be appropriate for the State to postpone ground-water remediation ifa new technology (i.e., one that currently is not available) offers significantadvantages over current technologies. Along the same lines, the State mustconsider the practicable capabilities of existing remedial technologiesbefore setting up a compliance schedule. For example, the amount and complexityof construction needed to implement a particular remedical technology couldbe an important factor or the amount of time that would routinely be neededto achieve the GWPS given a specified technology.The States also may consider, in dtermining a cleanup time schedule, thepracticable capability of the owner or operator of the MSWLF. These capabilitiesinclude both the economic and technical capabilities of the owner and operatorto initiate the corrective action program. As mentioned previously EPAdoes not intend to tradeoff environmental or human health protection forcost considerations. The use of practicable capability as a remedy decisionfactor was described earlier. Using the practicable capability of the owneror operator as well as other cost considerations (e.g., discussed in relationto resource value) in combination with the other factors described aboveto determine the cleanup time frame, allows the State to choose the combinationof actions that will effectively and erfficiently protect human healthand the environment and ensure that ground-water remediation is completed.The proposed factors undr andSection; 258.57(d) would allow the State toaccept a combination of remedies to be implemented in discrete phases.This phased approach may affect the time required to achieve the finalcleanup. Such an approach will ensure that important environmental problemsare addressed first (interim measures may also be used; see preamble discussionof andSection; 258.58(a)(4)). This phased approach may be frequently necessaryat operating facilities to prevent the disruption of solid waste disposal.Initial actions would always include steps to prevent exposure to the contaminatedground water (e.g. make alternative water available). An initial remedialstep may be to install a pump and treat system that would minimize furthermigration of the plume. These steps could continue until more active remediationor source control could be implemented.Section 258.57(e) of today's proposal requires the State to establish aGWPS for each Appendix II constituent detected above trigger levels. TheGWPS represents constituent concentrations that remedies must achieve.The GWPS is set on a constituent-specific basis during the remedy selectionprocess.The State must set the GWPS within the overall context of the remedy selectionprocess. During the assessment of corrective measures (andSection; 258.56)the owner or operator should design remedies to meet target cleanup levels.These target cleanup levels may start out as trigger levels, but, as pertinentsite-specific information becomes available, the State should modify thetarget levels. The remedies analyzed by the owner or operator should generallybe designed to meet the target levels. The State will ultimately selecta remedy and set a ground-water protection standard that must be achieved.The State's primary consideration in setting ground-water protection standardswill be to ensure that human health and the environment are protected.As in the case of trigger levels, the State should generally use promulgatedhealth-based standards (e.g., MCLs) and GWPS, where they are available.Where MCLs or other such standards are not available, the State may relyon RfDs and RSDs in developing ground-water protection standards (see preamblediscussion of Determination of Trigger Levels for more information aboutRfDs and RDSs). For noncarcinogens, the State may set a level based onthe RfD. States have flexibility to select a GWPS within the protectiverisk range (see preamble discussion of risk range alternatives being consideredand of Determination of Trigger Levels).A variety of site-specific and/or remedy-specific considerations may enterinto the determination of where within the cancer risk range the ground-waterprotection standard for a given hazardous constituent will be established.The most appropriate level for cancer risk must be determined through ananalysis of factors related to exposure, uncertainty, and technical limitations.Proposed andSection; 258.57(e) lists five factors the State may considerin establishing GWPSs.The first site-specific factor is multiple contaminants in the ground water.To ensure that individuals exposed to ground water will be protected, itmay be necessary to consider the risks posed by other constituents in theground water before a GWPS for a single constituent can be extablished.In considering the risks posed by multiple contaminants, the State shouldfollow the procedures and principles established in the Agency's ``Guidelinesfor the Health Risk Assessment of Chemical Mixtures'' (51 FR 34014) issuedon September 24, 1986. All other factors being the same, the GWPS for aconstituent present in ground water that is contaminated with other constituentsthat pose significant risks should be established at a lower concentrationthan if that constituent were the sole contaminant in the ground water.Taken as a whole, once final remediation is completed, ground water mustnot pose a risk greater than 1andmultiply;10^4. To the extent practicablefor new MSWLFs, the overall risk level for the ground water (not for eachconstituent) should be equivalent to the risk level used in meeting thedesign standard (see preamble discussion of andSection; 258.40).The second factor is actual or potential exposure threats to sensitiveenvironmental receptors. Frequently, levels set for protection of humanhealth also will be protective of the environment. However, there may beinstances where adverse environmental effects may occur at or below levelsthat are protective of human health. Sensitive ecosystems or threatenedor endangered species' habitats should be considered in establishing theGWPS.The next factor is other site-specific exposures to the contaminated groundwater. For example, residents living near a municipal solid waste landfillmay receive unusually high exposures of hazardous constituents from othersources (e.g., lead from a lead smelter). These other exposures shouldbe considered when developing the GWPS.The last consideration is remedy-specific factors. The State must considerthe reliability, effectiveness, practicability, and other relevant factorsof the remedy when establishing a GWPS. For example, a remedy that cantreat constituents in ground water down to concentrations posing a 1andmultiply;10^5risk level may be selected in preference to another remedy that might achievea 1andmultiply;10^6 risk level, but that relies on technology that has notbeen successfully demonstrated or may be unreliable for other reasons.There also are technical limitations that must be considered, in additionto scientific information about the hazards to human health and the environment,in establishing ground-water protection standards. For example, GWPSs shouldnot be set lower than detectable levels.Proposed andSection; 258.57(e)(5)(i) establishes that a GWPS hould not beset below background levels unless the State determines that cleanup tolevels below background is necessary to protect human health or the environment.In general, the Agency believes that it may not be reasonable to requirethe owner or operator to reduce the concentrations of hazardous constituentsto levels below background. In many cases such a reduction would not betechnically feasible. Today's proposal, however, does not allow MSWLFslocated in contaminated areas to ignore incrementally significant facilitycontributions to the contamination unless a determination is made underproposed andSection; 258.57(f) that remediation is not required.Proposed andSection; 258.57(f) identifies three situations in which the Statemay decide not to require cleanup of a release to ground water of hazardouswaste or hazardous constituents from an MSWLF, thus obviating the needto establish ground-water protection standards. These situations are limitedto cases where there is no threat of exposure to releases from MSWLFs,or cases where cleanup will not result in any reduction in risk to humanhealth or the environment. In any case, the State may impose under andSection;258.57(g) source control requirements to minimize or eliminate furtherreleases from the MSWLF even if remediation is not required. The Agencydoes not believe that continued further degradation of the environmentis warranted, even in those situations where cleanup may not be required.In some cases, MSWLFs releasing hazardous constituents to the ground waterwill be located in areas that already are significantly contaminated. Wherereleases from the MSWLFs are trivial compared to the overall area-widecontamination, or where remedial measures aimed at the MSWLF would notsignificantly reduce risk, EPA believes that remediation of releases fromthe MSWLF would not be necessary or appropriate. In these situations, proposedandSection; 258.57(f)(1) would allow the facility owner or operator to providethe State information demonstrating that remediation would provide no significantreduction in risk. If the demonstration were made, the State should determinethat remediation is not necessary.For example, ground water below a leaking MSWLF might be heavily contaminatedfrom off-site sources. In this case, removal of the MSWLFs contributionto the contamination might have very limited benefit, particularly if thatcontribution was relatively minor. Control of the MSWLF releases mightdo very little, in such a case, to improve the overall situation in thearea, yet (in the case of an operating unit) might be extremely burdensometo the owner or operator.Two points should be stressed here, however. First, the facility owneror operator would be required to remediate the ground water where it couldhave a significant effect on reducing risks_for example, as part of anarea-wide cleanup strategy. Second, in any case, under andSection; 258.57(g)source control may be required to prevent further releases.The Agency has not attempted to define ``significant reductions'' in riskin this rulemaking, and believes the decision is best made on a case-by-casebasis by the State. However, the Agency seeks comment on whether a morespecific definition is necessary for the purposes of this rulemaking.Under proposed andSection; 258.57(f)(2), the State may determine that a hazardousconstituent that has been released from an MSWLF to ground water does notpose a threat to human health and the environment and, therefore, doesnot require remediation if: (1) The ground water is not a current or potentialsource of drinking water and (2) the ground water is not hydraulicallyconnected with waters to which the hazardous constituents are migratingor are likely to migrate in a concentration(s) that represents a statisticallysignificant increase over background concentrations.In interpreting whether the aquifer meets these criteria, the State mayuse the approach outlined in the Agency's Ground-Water Protection Strategy(August 1984) as guidance. Typically, Class III ground waters will be consideredto meet the requirements specified in andSection; 258.57(f)(2)(i). ClassIII ground waters are ground waters not considered potential sources ofdrinking water. They are ground waters that are heavily saline, with TDSlevels over 10,000 mg/l, or are otherwise contaminated beyond levels thatallow cleanup using methods reasonably employed in public water systemtreatment. These ground waters also must not migrate to Class I or II groundwaters or have a discharge to surface water that could cause degradation.The need to remediate Class III ground waters should be assessed on a case-by-casebasis.Proposed andSection; 258.57(f)(3) would allow the State to make a determinationthat remediation of a release is not required when remediation is technicallyimpracticable or when remediation presents unacceptable cross-media impacts.Such a determination may be made, for example, in some cases where thenature of the hydrogeologic setting would prevent installation of a ground-waterpump and treat system (or other effective cleanup technology), e.g., inKarst formations or where heavily fractured bedrock lies under the facility.In these situations, the installation of such a system could possibly increaseenvironmental degradation by introducing the contaminant into ground waterthat was not previously affected by the release. The Agency is persuadedthat in this and other situations remediation should not be required. TheAgency is specifically soliciting comment today on the types of situationsthat might warrant a determination that remediation of a release is technicallyimpracticable or presents unacceptable impacts and would not, therefore,be required.Proposed andSection; 258.57(h) outlines the Agency's proposed approach toestablishing conditions the owner or operator must fulfill to achieve anddemonstrate compliance with the GWPS established by the State during theremedy selection process.First, the GWPS must be achieved at all points within the plume of contaminationthat lie beyond the ground-water monitoring well system established underandSection; 258.51(a). The ground-water monitoring well system is establishedat the boundary chosen for the design (i.e., at the unit boundary or aState alternative boundary that does not exceed 150 meters from the wastemanagement unit boundary and is on land owned by the owner or operatorof the MSWLF (see preamble discussion of andSection; 258.51(a)). It is logicalthat cleanup be required up to the boundary for which the facility wasdesigned to meet a health-based risk level.The Agency also is proposing under andSection; 258.57(h)(2) that the Statespecify in the remedy the length of time during which the owner or operatormust demonstrate that concentrations of hazardous constituents have notexceeded specified concentrations in order to achieve compliance with GWPSs.Under existing Subtitle C regulations (andSection; 264.100), the Agency hasrequired that facility owners or operators remediating ground-water contaminationfrom regulated hazardous waste units continue corrective action until thedesignated GWPSs have not been exceeded for a period of three years. TheAgency has found that, given the variety of hydrogeologic settings of facilitiesand characteristics of the hazardous constituents, it is difficult to demonstratereliably that the GWPSs have been achieved by imposing a uniform time fordemonstrating compliance. Consequently, the Agency is considering proposingchanges to the Subtitle C program.In today's proposal for MSWLFs, the Agency is proposing that the Statespecify the length of time required to make such a demonstration on a site-specificbasis. As described under proposed andSection; 258.57(h)(2), the State mayconsider four factors in setting this timing requirement: (1) The extentand concentration of the release, (2) the behavior characteristics of thehazardous constituents in the ground water, (3) the accuracy of the monitoringtechniques, and (4) characteristics of the ground water. The Agency believesthat consideration of these factors will allow the State to set an appropriatetime period for demonstrating compliance with GWPSs rather than relyingon an arbitrary time period for all facilities or all situations at thesame facility.One example of how these considerations might affect a decision on thetime a ground-water protection standard must not be exceeded to demonstratecompliance is given here. The Agency expects that pump and treat systemswill be necessary at many MSWLFs. Experience in the RCRA Subpart F program(which addresses releases of hazardous constituents to ground water fromregulated hazardous waste units) has shown that continuous operation ofa pump and treat system may interfere with the owner or operator's abilityto obtain accurate sampling data on constituent concentration levels. Allowingnatural restoration of chemical equilibrium in the affected ground waterafter the pump and treat system is turned off will be necessary to obtainaccurate readings of constituent concentrations. If the concentration(s)rise to unacceptable levels after the remedial technology is disconnected,reinitiation of treatment may be required. This process would have to berepeated until acceptable concentration levels are achieved after chemicalequilibrium has been reached in the ground water with the treatment systemsuspended.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Section 258.58 Implementation of the Corrective Action Program</ITAG>Implementation of a corrective action program is required when hazardousconstituents are detected at levels higher than the GWPS. Several activitiesare required of the owner or operator under proposed andSection; 258.58.First, a corrective action ground-water monitoring program is requiredunder proposed andSection; 258.58(a)(1). This program must meet the requirementof the Phase II monitoring program (andSection; 258.55), demonstrate theeffectiveness of the remedy(s), and demonstrate compliance with the GWPS.Second, under andSection; 258.58(a)(2), the owner or operator must implementthe remedy(s) selected by the State under andSection; 258.57. As describedunder andSection; 258.57, the ``remedy'' encompasses not only the technologyto be used to remediate the ground water (if remediation is to be conducted),but also the GWPSs to be reached and the time the owner or operator hasto reach the standards (see preamble discussion of andSection; 258.57).Next, under andSection; 258.58(a)(3), the owner or operator must notify allpersons who own or reside on the land that overlies any part of the plumeof contamination. The State may require the owner or operator to notifysuch persons any time the trigger level has been exceeded (i.e., beforethe GWPS has been established) if the State determines it necessary toprotect human health or the environment (see andSection; 258.58(f)).Under the proposed andSection; 258.58(a)(4) the State may require the owneror operator to conduct interim measures at an MSWLF whenever the Statedetermines such actions are necessary to protect human health or the environment.The interim measures would serve to mitigate actual threats and preventpotential threats from being realized while a long-term comprehensive responsecan be developed. Interim measures should, when possible, be consistentwith the expected final remedy. The State should consider the immediacyand magnitude of the threat to human health or the environment as primaryfactors in determining whether an interim measure(s) is required. ProposedandSection; 258.58(a)(4)(i)-(vii) lists factors that the State may considerin determining whether an interim measure is required. Interim measures may encompass a broad range of actions. For example, anowner or operator responsible for contamination of a drinking water wellmay be required to make available an alternative supply of drinking wateras an interim measure in an effort to protect human health. This replacementaction could be temporary or permanent. The duration of the period overwhich replacement supplies must be provided can affect the type of actionselected. Replacement actions may include hooking up affected aquifers,relocating wells, and treating contaminated ground water at the point ofuse. During the implementation stage, other factors may arise that make thechosen remedy technically impracticable. For example, the unexpected occurrenceof an area of unstable soils may render the chosen source control remedyimpossible to construct. Proposed andSection; 258.58(b) describes factorsthe State must consider in making such a determination. In these instances,the State may require that the owner or operator implement other alternativesto control exposure to residual contamination as described under andSection;258.58(c). The State also may require the owner or operator to implementother source control options and other equipment, unit, device, or structuredecontamination activities. The State will evaluate these alternative activitiesfor their technical practicability and their consistency with the overallobjectives of the original remedy. The GWPS will not be changed; however,the State may want to adjust the time allowed for completion of the remedy.Proposed andSection; 258.58(d) requires that wastes generated during theimplementation of corrective action be managed in a manner that is protectiveof human health and the environment. In particular, the waste managementpractices must be in compliance with all applicable RCRA requirements.According to proposed andSection; 258.58(e), the remedy is considered completewhen the GWPS has been achieved according to the requirements of andSection;258.57(h) and all other actions required in the remedy have been completed(e.g., source control measures). After the required remedy is complete,the owner or operator must submit a statement that certifies that the remedyhas been completed in accordance with requirements under andSection; 258.58(e).In addition to the owner or operator's signature the certification mustcontain the signature of an independent professional engineer geologist,or other appropriate technically trained person. According to andSection;258.58(g), after the State receives the certification and is satisfiedthat the remedy is complete, the State releases the owner or operator fromthe requirements for financial assurance for corrective action. The Agency considered an alternative approach to the corrective actionprogram proposed today. The alternative would involve the following steps.First: the owner or operator would be required to do three activities:(1) Report to the State any concentration of hazardous constituents inthe ground water above trigger levels, (2) investigate the nature and extentof the contamination, and (3) take all necessary actions to abate any immediaterisks to human health and the environment. Second, after the owner or operatorsubmitted the results of the investigation, the State would assess, site-specifically,the risks to human health and the environment posed by the ground watercontamination. Based on this assessment, the State would set site-specificrequirements for clean up of the ground water (including cleanup levels).Next the owner or operator would be required to submit to the State forapproval a plan for meeting the cleanup requirements. The owner or operatorthen must implement the approved plan. Modifications to the plan wouldbe allowed, if needed, based on site-specific considerations. The approachwould present fewer specific Federal requirements for cleanup. The Agencyrequests comment on this alternative approach as well as the proposed correctiveaction requirements discussed above. <ITAG tagnum="84">X. Effective Date, Implementation, and Enforcement of the RevisedCriteria </ITAG>Subtitle D of RCRA, as amended by HSWA in 1984, requires the Administratorto revise the Criteria for sanitary landfills under andSection; 4004(a) andthe solid waste management guidelines under section 1008(a) for facilitiesthat may receive HHW or hazardous wastes from SQGs. Subtitle D also containsspecific requirements with respect to the implementation and enforcementof the revised Criteria for facilities that may receive these wastes. Ofparticular significance is the provision in andSection; 4005(c) requiringthat States adopt and implement, within 18 months of the promulgation ofthe revised Criteria, a facility permit program or other system of priorapproval to ensure compliance with the revised Criteria. In addition, thissection provides that ``in any state that the Administrator determineshas not adopted an adequate program * * * the Administrator may use theauthorities available under section 3007 and 3008 of [Subtitle C] to enforcethe prohibition contained in subsection (a) of this section with respectto such facilities.'' A discussion of the issues regarding the implementationand enforcement of the revised Criteria and the options the Agency is consideringfor addressing these issues is set forth below. A. Effective Date of the Revised Criteria EPA today is proposing that the revised Criteria become effective 18 monthsafter their promulgation. The Agency considered an alternative two-stageapproach, which is described below, but decided that 18 months is the mostappropriate time period for several reasons. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Eighteen-month Period</ITAG>First, the 18-month time period would coincide with the period within whichStates, under section 4005(c) of RCRA, are to adopt and implement a permitprogram or other system of prior approval to ensure that facilities complywith the revised Criteria. Congress provided this 18-month period afterthe promulgation of the revised Criteria to provide States adequate timein which to adopt new or revise existing applicable State standards andto institute a permit process for ensuring facility compliance. Becausethe States are given the lead responsibility for implementing the revisedCriteria under these provisions, EPA believes it is critical to set aneffective date for the revised Criteria that coincides with the date theStates are required by RCRA to have their implementation mechanisms inplace. Second, the 18-month period would provide MSWLF owners and operators withsufficient time to take the necessary measures at their facilities to bringthem into compliance. EPA recognizes that certain of the revised Criteriaproposed today may require substantial efforts on the part of the facilityowner and operator both in modifying management practices at an existingMSWLF and in planning full compliance for a new one. The fact that mostMSWLFs are owned and run by local governments, which have limited resources,also is a consideration. Congress directed EPA to take into account the``practicable capability'' of facilities in revising the Criteria. EPAbelieves that the proposed 18-month period for allowing MSWLFs to comeinto compliance recognizes the practicable capability of MSWLFs to meetcertain of the revised Criteria.Although EPA recognizes that some of the revised Criteria could be implementedin shorter periods of time, i.e., six or 12 months, EPA believes that auniform effective date of 18 months would minimize confusion on the partof the regulated community. Also, while the 18-month period before theeffective date proposed today would postpone application of the revisedCriteria to MSWLFs, it would not leave these facilities unregulated. Thecurrent part 257 Criteria and applicable State standards would remain ineffect for these facilities until the revised Criteria become effective.In addition, some States may adopt the revised Criteria, making them effectiveunder their own authorities, before the 18-month period expires. EPA recognizes that there are some limitations with this approach. EPAis concerned that the 18-month period between the promulgation and theeffective date of the revised Criteria might allow some MSWLFs to closeto avoid meeting the new requirements. The Agency does not intend for thisperiod to be a window of escape for marginal MSWLFs. Experience shows,however, that MSWLFs do not open and close overnight. In fact, the longoperating lives of most existing MSWLFs and years of advance planning neededfor siting and permitting new facilities significantly mitigate againstsuch actions. The Agency is aware that some closures may occur, however,and intends to work with the States to guard against closures performedin an unsatisfactory manner that may pose threats to human health and theenvironment. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Two-stage Approach</ITAG>The 18-month approach would preclude enforcement of the revised Criteriathrough the citizen suit provisions of RCRA andSection; 7002 pending theirbecoming effective. Thus, for 18 months, citizens will be unable to useRCRA to enforce the revised Criteria. For this reason, EPA is consideringthe option of establishing two stages of effective dates. The first stageof effective dates would be for only those requirements that can be implementedby the facility owner or operator in less than 18 months and are self-implementingon their face, thus, leading themselves to more immediate effective dates.The effective date would be set at six or 12 months after the promulgationdate as appropriate for the specific requirement. The self-implementingprovisions of this rule include the general operating criteria such asthe liquids management restrictions, the disease vector and explosive gascontrols, recordkeeping, and closure and post-closure planning requirements.The second-stage effective date would be limited to those requirementsthat require interactions with or determinations by the State and substantialefforts on the part of the facility owner or operator for effective implementation.These requirements include the ground-water monitoring and corrective actionrequirements. The two-tiered approach would maximize the use of citizensuit provisions during the 18-month period because some of the requirementswould be in effect sooner, i.e., in 6 12 months; however, this approachruns the risk of causing considerable confusion on the part of regulatedfacilities and inconsistent application of the revised Criteria nationwide.Although EPA has decided to propose an effective date for all the revisedCriteria of 18 months after the date of promulgation, EPA specificallysolicits public comment on the alternative two-stage effective date approachdescribed above. B. Review of State Permit Programs Section 4005(c) of RCRA, as amended in 1984 by HSWA, requires the Administratorto determine whether each State has developed an adequate permit programor other system of prior approval and conditions to ensure that each solidwaste disposal facility that receives HHW or SQG hazardous waste will complywith the revised Criteria. The Administrator also is given the discretionaryauthority to preform these reviews in conjunction with the reviews of Statesolid waste management plans under RCRA andSection; 4007. The Agency solicits comments concerning the most appropriate means fordetermining the adequacy of State permit or other prior approval programs.Issues include whether the Agency should confine its review to assessementof a State's permit or other prior approval program or whether the Agencyshould expand this review to include all the components of the State'ssolid waste management plan. Under the first option, the Agency only wouldreview the State's permit or approval program that incorporated the revisedCriteria. The Agency's review of the State program would be limited tothat portion of the State's Subtitle D program. The Agency recognizes thatan expanded review under the second option would provide the State withthe flexibility to present additional elements of its solid waste managementprogram, outside of the permit or other prior approval program, that helpensure the proper management of solid waste disposal facilities. In addition,this broader evaluation would provide the Agency with a better understandingand appreciation of State implementation activities under Subtitle D. The latter option, however, would require all of the States to either developor modify their solid waste management plans to reflect the revised Criteria.The development and/or modification of these plans is a lengthy, and resource-intensiveprocess. The States may not be able to meet the HSWA requirement to adoptand implement a permit program or other system of prior approval within18 months from promulgation of the revised Criteria if they also must revisetheir solid waste management plans. Depending on the outcome of the above issues, the Agency may need to modifythe Guidelines for Development and Implementation of State Solid WasteManagement Plans (40 CFR Part 256), which delineate the requirements andprocedures for State solid waste management plan review. The current Part256 guidelines comprehensively address program requirements, solid wastemanagement plan submittal procedures, organizational issues, permit programs,legislative and regulatory authorities, and public participation requirements.The Agency may need to modify Part 256 to clearly specify the Agency'sevaluation criteria and review procedures for the revised Subtitle D Criteria.There are two other issues on which the Agency specifically requests comments.The first issue relates to what evaluation criteria the Agency should useto determine the adequacy of State permit programs. One option is for theAgency to base its determination of program adequacy on the content ofthe State's statutory and regulatory requirements. Under this approach,the Agency would develop evaluation criteria for determining whether theseState requirements ensure that the revised Criteria are met.On the other hand, the Agency could assess State programs on the basisof legislative and regulatory mechanisms together with an evaluation ofprogram effectiveness. This review would include an assessment of the State'spast performance (i.e., enforcement, permitting) in managing solid wastedisposal activities. In particular, the Agency would consider State resourceand technical capabilities in evaluating State program adequacy.The second issue concerns the extent of public participation that shouldbe provided for in the Agency's review of State program adequacy. The Agencyis soliciting comments on whether there should be opportunities for publicreview and comment on the Agency's evaluation of the adequacy of Statesolid waste permitting programs or other aspects of the State's solid wastemanagement plan. While the Agency recognizes that such participation opportunitiesmay significantly extend the review period, EPA nevertheless is interestedin providing such opportunities when appropriate. EPA will publish a morespecific proposal addressing these issues at a later date.C. Enforcement of the Revised CriteriaStates that have adopted the revised Criteria under State law may enforcethem in accordance with State authorities. Under today's proposal, therewould be no authority for EPA enforcement of the revised Criteria until,18 months after the date of promulgation of the revised Criteria, the Agencydetermines that a State's program is inadequate. Also, citizens would beprecluded from enforcing the revised Criteria via citizen suits until theCriteria become effective.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Citizen Suits</ITAG>As with the Part 257 Criteria, citizens may seek enforcement of the Part258 revised Criteria (independently of any State program for their enforcement)by means of citizen suits. The citizen suit provisions of RCRA containedin section 7002 provide an important mechanism for ensuring compliancewith the requirements of the statute and its implementing regulations.They authorize individuals, environmental groups, and local governments,among others, to bring legal actions for noncompliance with RCRA requirements.Thus, once the revised Criteria become effective, they have the full forceof law and may constitute the basis for citizen enforcement actions againstfacilities that fail to comply. Citizens would be able to bring actionsagainst facilities for failure to comply with the Criteria and actionsagainst States for failure to develop and implement permit or other priorapproval programs as required by RCRA section 4005.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Federal Enforcement</ITAG>Section 4005(c)(2) of RCRA, as amended by HSWA in 1984, provides authorityfor EPA enforcement of the revised Criteria under authority of sections3007 and 3008 of Subtitle C. This provision is significant in that it representsthe first authority for EPA enforcement of regulatory requirements underSubtitle D. According to section 4005(c)(2), EPA enforcement is contingenton an EPA determination that a State has not adopted an adequate permitor other prior approval program to ensure the compliance of facilitieswith the revised Criteria by 18 months from the date of promulgation ofthe revised Criteria. Having made this determination, EPA may use the inspectionand enforcement authorities under sections 3007 and 3008 to enforce againstfacilities failing to comply with the revised Criteria. Disposal of solidwaste at facilities that do not comply with the revised Criteria constitutesopen dumping. These authorities provide EPA with the necessary tools toenforce Subtitle D's prohibition against open dumping.EPA expects the States to assume the primary responsibility for implementingand enforcing the revised Criteria, and a major EPA enforcement programfor Subtitle D is not envisioned. If States fail to assume their responsibilitywith respect to the revised Criteria, however, EPA may step in to ensurecompliance with Part 258 as necessary to protect human health and the environment.As explained above, EPA is soliciting comments on the criteria and proceduresthat it should use to determine whether a State has adopted an adequateprogram.EPA has determined that it is necessary to formulate an enforcement strategywith respect to the revised Criteria and welcomes public comment on theoverall role of EPA enforcement under Subtitle D, the proper elements ofan enforcement policy for ensuring compliance with the revised Criteria,and strategies for targeting MSWLFs that pose the greatest threat to humanhealth and the environment. EPA is soliciting public comment on the specificcircumstances and situations of facility noncompliance with the revisedCriteria that should precipitate direct EPA enforcement actions. In addition,the Agency is particularly interested in comments on circumstances underwhich the Agency should act to enforce criteria once the Administratorhas determined that the State's program is inadequate pursuant to section4005(c)(1)(C).D. Other Implementation Issues<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Implementation Strategy</ITAG>In conjunction with the development of this rule, the Agency is preparingan implementation strategy. This strategy will serve as a planning documentfor EPA and the States in understanding what actions are necessary to modifythe management of their regulatory programs to accommodate the revisedCriteria. This strategy is designed to limit future implementation problemsby anticipating potential problems or obstacles and crafting implementationoptions to resolve or minimize these issues before they emerge.The Agency currently is identifying implementation issues and needs concerningpermitting, compliance monitoring, and enforcement activities; public educationand outreach activities; guidance and training needs; resource needs; andEPA/State roles and responsibilities. In particular, the Agency requestscomments on the following implementation concerns: (1) What types of education-outreachprograms are needed for State and local officials, the regulated community,and the general public? (2) In what areas is there a need for guidanceand training? What types of technical assistance activities are needed?(3) What is an appropriate and practical EPA role if the States do notadopt and implement the revised Criteria?The Agency also solicits comment on whether additional issues should beconsidered in developing this strategy.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Co-disposal of Sewage Sludge</ITAG>One of the major disposal practices for sewage sludge is disposal at amunicipal solid waste landfill. Approximately 6,800 POTWs dispose of theirsewage sludge in this manner. By promulgating the Part 258 requirementsjointly under RCRA and CWA section 405, questions arise as to the extentto which the Part 258 criteria would be implemented through NPDES permitsissued to POTWs. Under RCRA Subtitle D (section 4005(c)), the Part 258criteria are to be imposed by States on the owner or operator of an MSWLF.States are to impose the criteria by a system of prior approval and conditions,such as issuance of a permit to the MSWLF. The Agency has selected thisapproach to reconcile the two programs in a way that would minimize duplicativeregulation while best ensuring complete coverage under both statutes. Thisapproach would be consistent with section 1006(b) of RCRA, which requiresEPA to integrate the provisions of RCRA for purposes of administrationand enforcement, and to avoid duplication to the maximum extent practicable,with the appropriate provisions of the CWA and other environmental lawsadministered by EPA.Under this proposal, the Part 258 criteria applicable to the characteristicsof sewage sludge that must be met if sewage sludge is placed in an MSWLFwould be implemented through permits issued to POTWs pursuant to section405(f) of the CWA. The Part 258 criteria applicable to the landfill sitewould be implemented under the RCRA Subtitle D program. This would meanthat the POTW permit would prohibit the disposal in an MSWLF of sludgefound to be hazardous (andSection; 258.20), and would require that the sludgepass the Paint Filter Liquids Test (andSection; 258.28). The POTW permitalso would prohibit the POTW from sending its sludge to MSWLFs that arenot in compliance with the applicable Federal and State regulations. Thus,to obtain a permit authorizing disposal of sludge at a landfill, the POTWwould have to ascertain that the MSWLF either has a permit under Part 258or otherwise is authorized to operate as an MSWLF by the State in whichit exists, as prescribed by RCRA.EPA believes that this implementation scheme fulfills the goals and policiesof both RCRA and the CWA and is a rational way to reconcile overlappingprograms. EPA also considered separate implementation of the Part 258 criteriaunder each program. Under the sludge management program of the CWA, thismethod would involve implementation of all Part 258 criteria, includingthose applicable to location, design, and operation of the landfill, throughpermits issued to the POTWs. The Agency decided against this approach fortwo reasons. First, it would establish duplicative coverage without apparentcorresponding environmental benefits. Typically, sewage constitutes a smallproportion of the wastes disposed at an MSWLF. Compared to other wastessent to an MSWLF, such as household hazardous waste and hazardous wastefrom very small quantity generators, sewage sludge is unlikely to be thesource of environmental problems at the landfill. In fact, the presenceof sewage sludge in a co-disposal facility may even improve the qualityof the leachate at least in the short run (Ref. 15). Second, holding POTWsliable for compliance by the landfill with the Part 258 standards may notbe appropriate because other solid waste contributors are not similarlyheld liable.EPA invites comment on whether the approach proposed here is an appropriateand effective means to ensure proper management of sewage sludge disposedof in a landfill. <ITAG tagnum="84">XI. Regulatory Requirements </ITAG>A. Executive Order No. 12291 <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Purpose </ITAG>The Agency estimated the costs, benefits, and economic impacts of today'sproposed rule. These analyses are required for ``major'' regulations asdefined by Executive Order No. 12291. The Agency also is required underthe Regulatory FLexibility Act to assess small business impacts resultingfrom the proposed rule. The cost and economic impact analyses also area measure of the ``practicable capability'' of facilities to comply withthe proposed rule. The cost, benefit, and economic impact results indicate that today's ruleis a ``major'' regulation and it would likely impose differential impactson a significant number of small entities. This section of the preamblediscusses the results of the analyses of the proposed rule as detailedin the draft Regulatory Impact Analysis of Proposed Revisions to SubtitleD Criteria for Municipal Solid Waste Landfills. The draft RIA is availablein the public docket. This rule was submitted to the Office of Managementand Budget (OMB) for review as required by E.O. No. 12291. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Regulatory Alternatives </ITAG>E.O. No. 12291 requires EPA to estimate the costs and benefits for theproposed rule as well as any viable alternatives. Several current provisions(e.g., performance standards for existing units, post-closure care, ground-watermonitoring parameters) of the proposed rule do not exactly reflect whatwas analyzed in the RIA. For this reason, the results presented in thissection and the RIA may understate the fraction of existing landfills requiringmore stringent covers (and the resulting costs of these covers), overstatecosts for post-closure care, and understate the sampling costs for ground-watermonitoring. Nonetheless, the Agency believes the basic conclusions of thedraft RIA are accurate estimators of the effects of the proposed rule.In addition to the proposed rule, EPA analyzed the effects of three regulatoryalternatives in the RIA. The analysis of the regulatory options providesa comparison of the proposed rule in the context of other regulatory scenarios.The alternatives predominantly differ with respect to the stringency anduniformity of the containment and cover requirements. Corrective action(the benefits of which currently are modeled for new units only) and extendedpost-closure care are required for all regulatory options. Alternative 1 consists of a uniform set of technology-based requirementsthat are imposed on all MSWLFs irrespective of location or migration potential.This alternative has the most stringent design requirements and essentiallyreflects the Subtitle C regulations for land disposal. New units are requiredto have a double composite containment system (i.e., two synthetic linersover a clay liner) with two LCSs and a composite cover. New and existingunits are required to close with a composite cover. Ground-water monitoring(as detailed in Subpart F of 40 CFR Part 264), gas monitoring, run-on andrun-off controls, and exclusion plan for nonmunicipal solid waste, correctiveaction, and extended post-closure care are required for both new and existingunits under this regulatory alternative. Alternative 2 requires cover and containment designs based on the migrationpotential at the site. This categorical approach is described in SectionD of this preamble. General facility standards are identical to those forthe proposed rule. Corrective action and extended post-closure care arerequired for all units. Alternative 3 imposes ground-water monitoring, corrective action, and extendedpost-closure care on both new and existing units. This alternative is similarto the statutory minimum described under Section D of this preamble exceptthat location standards are not analyzed. Costs, economic impacts, and risk estimates (including resource damage)are presented in this section for the proposal and the three regulatoryalternatives; primary emphasis will be on results for the proposed rule.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Cost Analysis </ITAG><T3>a. Methodology. </T3>The Agency developed an engineering cost modelto estimate total costs for an MSWLF under a variety of technical and regulatoryscenarios. This model estimates the cost to design, construct, operate,close, and provide post-closure care for an MSWLF. The model allows foruser-specified input variables such as waste throughput, operating life,type and depth of fill operation, number of phases of construction, containmentand cover systems, waste density, environmental monitoring and control,post-closure care, and a variety of unit costs and fees for constructionand operation of the facility. Based on these inputs, the model calculatesthe necessary landfill dimensions (e.g., active area), capital costs, operatingand maintenance costs, closure costs, and post-closure costs of the facility.In addition, the model assigns these costs to specific years of the operatinglife and post-closure care and then calcualtes a present value (in 1986dollars) based on a 3 percent real disocunt rate. The model can estimatecosts for any landfill size between 10 and 1,500 TPD. National costs fora given option then are calcualted using these unit costs and a size distributionof MSWLFs. EPA selected a limited number of generic user inputs to the model and heldthese constant across the regulatory options so that cost differences inthe environmental controls would be highlighted. EPA selected seven modelfacility sizes for modeling costs. Preliminary results form the SubtitleD Solid Waste (Municipal) Landfill Survey (referred to here as the FacilitySurvey) were used to assign a frequency distribution to each size category.The seven model sizes used (and the assigned frequency of MSWLFs) are:10 TPD (51.4 percent), 25 TPD (16.9 percent), 75 TPD (12.7 percent), 175TPD (7.1 percent), 375 TPD (6.5 percent), 750 TPD (3.2 percent), and 1,500TPD (2.3 percent). (Although the 1,500 TPD category includes only 2.3 percentof all MSWLFs, these facilities handle 36.5 percent of all waste.) EPAassumed for the cost analysis that all MSWLFs opertate in one phase anduse a cut-and-fill method of operation. EPA estimated corrective action costs separately using the failure andrelease component of the risk model (described in Section X1.A.4 of thissection). EPA's approach to estimating corrective action costs partiallyreflects the flexibility of this requirement in the proposed rule. EPAestimated costs based on aggessive cleanup of new contamination and eitheraggressive or passive cleanup of existing plumes. This approach to estimatingcorrective action costs was used for all regulatory alternatives in additionto the proposed rule. For new contamination, EPA modeled the effects of ground-water recoverywells as the selected corrective action technology. The recovery wellsare assumed to be installed one year after the corrective action has beentriggered. For existing contamination, EPA estimated corrective action costs for twotypes of responses. The first response consists of active restoration ofthe plume using ground-water recovery wells (i.e., the approach modeledfor new facilities). EPA assumed that this approach will be utilized forlarger plume sizes as the most effective remedial measure. To partiallyaccount for the flexibility provided by the corrective action requirementin terms of the timing and response to contaminant plumes, the second responserepresents a passive approach for smaller plumes. EPA assumed that thispassive approach would consist of providing an alternative water supplyto affected user of the gound water. EPA recongizes that alternative technologiesor remedies may be employed for cleanup of affected ground water. Correctiveaction costs were added to the design and operating costs to derive totalcosts for a given regulatory option.   To obtain incremental regulatory costs, EPA first characterized MSWLF baselinepractices. Baseline practices are those design and operating practicesthat exist prior to the imposition of the requirements in today's proposedrule. EPA characterized baseline conditions using preliminary results fromthe Facility Survey and results from the State Census. For purposes ofthis analysis (including the economic impact and risk analyses discussedlater), EPA characterized the baseline facility as an unlined landfillwith a vegetative cover at closure, no environmental monitoring, no post-closurecare, and no corrective action. However, as described below, EPA adjustedcompliance costs to account for existing State requirements with respectto liners, leachate collection systems, and ground-water monitoring wellrequirements. The MSWLF population is extremely diverse in terms of itstechnical characteristics (e.g., presence of environmental controls, designcapacity, remaining life), which is due in part to a broad range of Staterequirements that vary in both scope and detail. EPA reviewed the Staterequirements to identify those States that require containment (i.e., liners,leachate collection systems) and ground-water monitoring well requirementsthat would likely satisfy the conditions in today's proposed rule. EPAidentified 22 States with similar liner and LCS requirements and 24 Statesthat have similar ground-water monitoring well requirements. EPA adjustedthe regulatory compliance cost estimates for facilities in these States.The adjustment for State liner and leachate collection system requirementswas made only for analyzing the costs of the proposed rule; the costs forall regulatory options accounted for the existence of State requirementsfor ground-water monitoring wells. To the extent that other existing Staterequirements are similar to those in today's proposed rule, the estimatedcompliance costs will be overstated. Although EPA adjusted the nationalcompliance cost estimates to reflect these State requirements, the riskand resource damage estimates were not adjusted to reflect the presenceof containment systems in the baseline. The benefits of the regulatoryoptions in protecting ground water as a drinking water source (presentedin this section and in the RIA) will likely be overstated by not incorporatingthe presence of these State requirements; however, EPA has not analyzedthe benefits of the regulatory options in reducing risk from other routesof exposure (e.g., surface water, subsurface gas, risks to the ecosystem).Therefore, the net benefits of the rule will likely be understated.The Agency estimated compliance costs for each Facility Survey respondent.EPA assigned each respondent a weighting factor that represents the frequencyof that type of facility in the total national regulated population of6,034 active MSWLFs. The weighting factors were used to scale respondentfacility costs up to national compliance costs for the regulatory options.EPA estimated compliance costs separately for new and existing requirements.In addition, EPA combined the new and existing MSWLF estimates to producea compliance cost figure that represents an average cost for existing unitsand their new replacement landfills. New landfills are assumed to be perpetuallyreplaced for this combined estimate.For new MSWLFs, all regulatory costs are assumed to apply from the timeconstruction begins. A new landfill is assumed to operate for 20 yearsand compliance costs (in present value terms) are annualized over thistime period. For those facilities with longer operating lives (approximately60 percent of all MSWLFs as reported in the Facility Survey), the annualizedcosts will be lower due to an increased amortization period for capitalcosts.For existing MSWLFs, the regulatory costs are applied over the remainingoperating life as reported in the Facility Survey. (Existing MSWLFs thatwere reported in the Facility Survey to be closing before the effectivedate of the proposed rule were not assigned existing requirement costs.These landfills were assumed to be replaced with new facilities to whichappropriate requirements were applied.) EPA annualized the regulatory costsfor an existing MSWLF over the remaining life of the facility. EPA assumedthat revenues are generated to pay for regulatory costs during the operatinglife. Although this is likely to be true for private landfills, publiclyowned facilities may have the option of passing on the costs (for facilitieswith short remaining lives) to future facilities and thus reduce the costimpact. Existing landfill costs will tend to be overstated for these facilitiesthat amortize the costs over a period that extends past the reported remaininglife.To develop a combined estimate of average annualized compliance costs forthe regulatory options, costs for existing units plus their new replacementlandfills have been discounted to one present value that spans the existinglandfill's remaining life plus the ongoing life of a new landfill thatis replaced every 20 years. (Replacement of all existing MSWLFs with newMSWLFs does not account for the current trend away from siting new landfills;moreover, it is unlikely that each of the existing 6,034 MSWLFs will havea replacement landfill in perpetuity. Regionalization, recycling, shiftsto resource recovery, and better siting of landfills in ``good'' locationswill result in fewer new MSWLFs than estimated in this analysis. EPA hasnot incorporated these factors into the analysis because they involve simulatingsite-specific local decisions that are difficult to analyze. EPA's costswill tend to be overstated by not including these factors.) EPA assumedthat the new MSWLF would be built at the same location such that the requireddesigns remain the same. EPA then annualized this present value as a perpetuityto obtain an annualized combined compliance cost estimate for a given regulatoryoption. Although this figure does not represent the actual cash flow (i.e.,for capital outlays) that would likely result from regulation, it doesrepresent a level annual payment as if the facility operator had borrowedfunds to pay the capital costs. This annualized combined cost estimateis used in the economic impact analysis of the regulatory options. Compliancecosts specific to new and existing requirements are presented in detailin the RIA; however, costs (and economic impacts) presented in this sectionof the preamble only reflect the combined estimates.For the proposed rule, EPA estimated the effect of the design goal on newMSWLFs by analyzing the baseline risks (a detailed discussion of the riskmethodology is presented later in this section). For the purposes of thisanalysis, EPA assumes all MSWLFs would comply with a design goal of 10^\5\from the allowable protective range of 10^\4\ to 10^\7\. Actual costs (andbenefits) of the proposed rule will vary depending on the state-selecteddesign goal. Landfills with an average most exposed individual risk below1 andmultiply; 10^\5\ in the baseline (i.e., unlined with a vegetative cover)were excluded from any further design requirements. EPA estimated thatthese facilities would not trigger corrective action since risks at theseunits would never exceed the 1 andmultiply; 10^\5\ trigger level used forthis regulatory analysis.Those new facilities that exceeded a 1andmultiply;10^\5\ risk level in thebaseline then were modeled with a synthetic cover. EPA assigned these facilitiesa synthetic cover if risks were reduced to below 1andmultiply;10^\5\. Forthe subset of facilities that still exceeded the design goal, EPA assigneda synthetic containment system with leachate collection and a syntheticcover. Those landfills that still exceeded the risk threshold with thismore stringent design would trigger corrective action. EPA selected thesedesigns for the purpose of conducting this analysis. These designs areneither specifically required by the proposed rule nor do they representthe only designs that could satisfy the performance standard; however,the chosen designs do represent features that would be applicable and effectivein a wide range of environmental settings.EPA only assigned liners and leachate collection systems to new units:no lateral expansion was assumed to occur at existing facilities so thatcovers would be the only applicable design requirement to meet the performancestandard. Under the proposed rule, existing units must have a cover thatprevents infiltration. In the RIA, EPA assigned a vegetative cover if baselinerisks were less than 1 andmultiply; 10^\5\; for the subset of facilitiesthat exceeded this baseline risk level, EPA assigned a synthetic cover.Other cover systems besides these two modeled in the RIA could be usedto comply with the performance standard. EPA moedled the proposed ruleat one design goal (1 andmultiply; 10^\5\) and two POCs: The waste unit managementboundary (modeled as the 10-meter POC) and the maximum allowed alternativeboundary of 150-meters (the 150-meter POC).For compliance at the 10-meter POC, EPA estimated that 61 percent of theMSWLFs would require an unlined unit with a vegetative cover design, 11percent an unlined unit with a synthetic cover, and the remaining 28 percenta synthetic liner with leachate collection and a synthetic cover. At the150-meter POC, EPA estimated the resulting percentages as 79, 9, and 13percent, respectively. In addition to the design requirements necessaryto achieve the design goal, EPA assigned compliance costs to both new andexisting units for the general facility standards and other requirements.These requirements include: Developing procedures for excluding hazardouswaste from the landfill, monitoring for methane in the subsurface and instructures, run-on and run-off controls, developing and implementing aclosure plan, and ground-water monitoring. Although EPA modeled an extendedpost-closure care period (including cover and slope maintenance, coverinspection, and ground-water monitoring) the proposal requires a two-phasedpost-closure care period at a minimum of 30 years. In addition, the ground-watermonitoring parameters modeled in the RIA differ from those under the proposedrule. EPA did not estimate costs for financial responsibility requirements.Detailed discussion on how EPA estimated compliance costs for these requirementsis provided in the RIA. Under the proposed rule, States may take into account the resource valueof ground-water supplies when determining ground-water monitoring requirements.EPA assumed in this cost analysis that ground-water monitoring systemsinclude one upgradient (three-well) cluster and a number of downgradientclusters that vary with the length of the downgradient boundary (e.g.,four clusters for a 10 TPD MSWLF, 20 clusters for a 1,500 TPD facility).EPA assumed that ground-water monitoring would be conducted on a semiannualbasis. For existing MSWLFs, the ground-water monitoring requirements werephased in over five years. Under the proposed rule, States may vary thenumber of wells, frequency of monitoring, and timing of ground-water monitoringimplementation. To the extent that actual ground-water monitoring requirementsspecified by the States differ from what was modeled in this analysis,the actual compliance costs will vary from those estimated by EPA. Alternative 1 imposes uniform standards on all MSWLFs. Existing unit requirementsare the same as for new units except that the containment and LCS requirementswere not assigned. Ground-water monitoring is not phased in, and the PhaseII list of parameters under the proposed rule is used as the list of constituentsfor which all units must monitor. EPA assigned a composite cover to allnew and existing units (similar to that described in 40 CFR 264.310) anda double composite containment system with two LCSs (similar to that describedin 40 CFR 264.301) to all new units. EPA assumed that clay for the coverand containment systems was obtained off site unless the survey respondentreported that clay or sandy clay was available at the facility. Alternative 2 represents a categorical approach, based on location, todetermine the necessary containment and cover requirements. This categoricalapproach is described in Section IX.D of this preamble. Landfills are assigneddesigns based on the local climate and hydrological factors that controlthe potential for leachate contamination (i.e., the migration potentialat the site). To estimate the effects of Alternative 2, EPA used respondent-supplieddata on location, primary soil type, saturated permeability, and porosityto determine the distribution of MSWLFs across the four location categories.EPA used the location data to assign an annual precipitation figure obtainedfrom the nearest National Weather Station. The annual cutoff value forhigh and low precipitation under Alternative 2 is 40 inches. To determinethe split between short and long time-of-travel, the Agency used eithera saturated time-of-travel equation or an alternative equation (a wetting-frontapproach) depending on whether the site was reported to be in a saturatedenvironment. The cutoff for short versus long time-of-travel is the greaterthe active life or 20 years. Using this approach, the Agency estimatesthat the percentages of all MSWLFs in location Categories I, II, III, andIV are 29.2 percent, 5.8 percent, 37.8 percent, and 27.2 percent, respectively.Cover and containment requirements, which are performance-based for Alternative2, were assessed for each survey respondent as described below. Alternative2 requires facilities to use a water-balance method to select the propercover that will minimize infiltration through the cover at any time inthe future. There are several measures that the facility owner or operatorcould undertake to meet this performance standard if the vegetative coverby itself is not sufficient. For example, in order to minimize infiltration,the owner or operator could vary the type of vegetation to increase theevapotranspiration, vary the slope of the cover to increase run-off, useheavier soils from off site, or install a clay or synthetic layer witha drainage collection system beneath the vegetative cover. These decisionsinvolve site-specific factors and are difficult to analyze. Thus, EPA limitedthe options for cover type to either vegetative or synthetic. EPA assumedthat MSWLFs with positive annual net precipitation (precipitation minuspotential evapotranspiration) will use a synthetic cover. EPA assumed thatlandfills with zero or negative net precipitation use the same cover designthat was simulated for the baseline, except that the cost includes additionalfees for quality assurance. (Potential evapotranspiration was determinedusing the Thornwaithe-Mather equation.) Using this approach, EPA estimatesthat 67 percent of all MSWLFs have positive net precipitation and thusare assigned synthetic covers; the remaining 33 percent are assumed toachieve the performance standard with vegetative covers. EPA applied costsfor these covers to both new and existing units. Alternative 2 assumes that all MSWLFs in location Categories II and IV(34 percent of all facilities) must have a leachate collection system;units in location Categories I and III must collect leachate if more thanone foot of leachate is generated over the active life. The Agency determinedthe leachate generation for Facility Survey respondents in Categories Iand III using the approach described in EPA publication 530/SW-168. TheAgency estimates that 63 percent of the landfills in these two categories(or 41 percent of all facilities) would need an LCS. Thus, across all MSWLFs,the Agency estimates that 75 percent will be required to have an LCS. Under Alternative 2, the need for a containment system for MSWLFs in locationCategories I and II only is related to the need for an LCS since they alreadyhave a long time-of-travel. A containment system is necessary if the nativesoil does not have a sufficiently low permeability to allow the LCS tofunction properly. EPA assumed that MSWLFs in these categories that needan LCS and that reported clay as their primary natural soil type in theFacility Survey do not need a liner (estimated as 10 percent of all MSWLFs).EPA assigned the remaining units (four percent of all facilities) thatneed an LCS in these categories a synthetic liner so that the LCS wouldperform efficiently. MSWLFs in Categories III and IV that need an LCS (estimated as 61 percentof all facilities) also must have a containment system that will increasethe time of travel to greater than the active life or 20 years. Althougha clay liner could possibly meet the performance standards, EPA assigneda synthetic liner, which would be less expensive in most cases, to theseunits. MSWLFs that do not need an LCS (estimated as 25 percent of all MSWLFs)are all in Categories I and III. Those facilities that are in CategoryI (20 percent of all MSWLFs) have a long time of travel, and thus do notneed a liner. For those in Category III (five percent of all MSWLFs), EPAassigned a two-foot thick clay liner that should provide sufficient delayto meet the performance standard. Moreover, even if clay had to be broughtfrom off site, a clay liner is less expensive than synthetic given thata synthetic liner would also require installation of a leachate collectionsystem. Although these assignments of designs to meet the performance standardsfor Alternative 2 do not reflect the inherent flexibility of performancerequirements, EPA believes that they do provide an indication of how thesestandards would be met. The general facility standard requirements (andresulting compliance costs) for Alternative 2 are identical to those analyzedfor the proposed rule. Alternative 3 consists of uniform criteria applied to both new and existinglandfills. This regulatory alternative is similar to the statutory minimummandated under HSWA and includes analysis of ground-water monitoring (throughoutan extended post-closure care period) and corrective action requirements;however, EPA has not incorporated any location standards into the analysisfor this alternative. Alternative 3 is the only regulatory option thatdoes not include general facility standards. EPA assumed that ground-watermonitoring would begin on the effective date of the regulation. A moredetailed discussion of the cost analysis for each of the regulatory optionsis included in the RIA.<T3>b. Cost Results. </T3>The Agency estimates that the proposed rule willresult in an annualized cost of approximately $880.0 million at the 10-meterPOC and $691.4 million at the 150-meter POC. Thus, based on the $100 millionannual cost threshold established in E.O. 12291, today's proposal is a``major'' regulation.Table 3 shows the size distribution of MSWLFs across the seven facilitysizes modeled in the cost analysis, as well as the annualized cost of theproposed rule for each facility size. EPA estimates that the smallest sizecategory (i.e., 10 TPD), while accounting for 51.3 percent of all MSWLFs,only accounts for 6-percent and 7-percent of the total cost of the proposedrule under the 10-meter and 150-meter POCs, respectively. The two largestsize categories modeled (750 and 1,500 TPD) account for only 5.7 percentof all MSWLFs, but 35 percent to 38 percent of the total cost under eitherPOC.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,i1,s10,8,8,9</C><T4>Table </T4>3._<T4>Annualized Combined Cost by Size, Proposed Rule</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Dollars in millions]</ITAG><H1>Size category (TPD)</H1><H1>Percentage of all MSWLFs</H1><H1>Annualized cost</H1><H2>10-meter POC</H2><H1>150-meter POC</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">10<D>51.3</D><D>$52.3</D><D>$47.3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">25<D>17.0</D><D>85.8</D><D>72.2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">75<D>13.1</D><D>134.0</D><D>107.6</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">175<D>7.3</D><D>128.5</D><D>95.6</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">375<D>5.5</D><D>148.7</D><D>130.3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">750<D>3.1</D><D>137.3</D><D>93.4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,500<D>2.6</D><D>193.4</D><D>145.0</D><R/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Total</ITAG><D>\1\ 100.0</D><D>880.0</D><D>691.4</D><F>\1\ Does not add due to rounding.</F></ITAG>EPA estimates that, under the 10-meter (150-meter) POC, approximately 46.7percent (52.5 percent for the 150-meter POC) of all MSWLFs will incur anincremental cost increase of less than $10 per ton; 49.2 percent (45 percentfor 150-meter POC) face an increase between $10 and $25 per ton, and 4.8percent (1.4 percent for 150-meter POC) will incur a compliance cost between$25 and $50 per ton. Under the 150-meter POC, EPA estimates that 1.2 percentof all MSWLFs will incur cost increases of greater than 50 percent perton due to expensive corrective actions that are triggered.Table 4 shows the total annualized combined costs for today's proposedrule and the three regulatory alternatives. The annualized costs, includingcorrective action, range from $419 million for Alternative 3 up to $3,341million for Alternative 1. The costs for the proposed rule, under eitherPOC, falls near the lower end of the range. Corrective action is triggeredunder all the regulatory options and represents from 2-percent (under Alternative1) to 72 percent (under Alternative 3) of the total costs. Corrective actionrepresents 11 percent and 19 percent of the total cost of the proposedrule for the 10-meter and 150-meter POCs, respectively. The relative costsacross options are affected by the stringency of the requirements only,since the facility size distribution and the range of remaining lives areconstant across all regulatory scenarios. The wide range in contributionof corrective action costs across the options reflects the reactive orpreventive nature of a given regulatory scenario. Alternative 3, representinga reactive approach to releases, has the largest percentage of correctiveaction costs to total costs among the regulatory options.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s10,10,10</C><T4>Table </T4>4._<T4>Total Annualized Costs for Regulatory Scenarios</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Dollars in millions]</ITAG><H1>Regulatory scenario</H1><H1>No corrective action</H1><H1>Including corrective action</H1>Proposal:<ITAG tagnum="3">10-meter POC</ITAG><D>$782.2</D><D>$880.0</D><ITAG tagnum="3">150-meter POC</ITAG><D>562.0</D><D>691.0</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Alternative 1</ITAG><D>3,268.6</D><D>3,341.0</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Alternative 2</ITAG><D>1,336.9</D><D>1,426.9</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Alternative 3</ITAG><D>117.1</D><D>419.4</D></ITAG>Table 5 presents the incremental cost per ton for the regulatory scenarios.The median, minimum, and maximum estimates are shown for each option.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>6,L2,b2,i1,s10,6,5,6,6,5</C><T4>Table </T4>5._<T4>Annualized Incremental Costs Per Ton by Option</T4><H1> </H1><H1>Proposal</H1><H2>10-meter POC</H2><H2>150-meter POC</H2><H1>Alt. 1</H1><H1>Alt. 2</H1><H1>Alt. 3</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Median<D>$11.01</D><D>$9.54</D><D>$47.58</D><D>$15.62</D><D>$5.17</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Maximum<D>40.61</D><D>81.39</D><D>108.11</D><D>48.38</D><D>54.45</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Minimum<D>0.76</D><D>0.75</D><D>4.01</D><D>0.75</D><D>0.06</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">4. Economic Impact Analysis</ITAG><T3>a. Methodology. </T3>Preliminary results from the Facility Survey indicatethat 80 percent of all MSWLFs are owned by local governments (e.g., counties,cities, towns, villages). These governments will incur the initial costsand impacts attributable to the revised Criteria; however, ultimately thegovernments will likely pass on the regulatory costs to their citizensand to other governments that also may use the landfill. The compliancecosts will be passed on in the form of increased taxes or fees or decreasedservices of other types if the community is operating under tight budgetaryconstraints. Thus, local citizens (the households that use the landfillsto dispose of their wastes) will eventually pay the increased costs oflandfill operation. The Agency assessed these short- and long-term impactsin a two-phase economic impact analysis. In the first phase, the abilityof governmental entities to pay for the regulatory costs was assessed.The second phase was an assessment of the ability of citizens to pay forthe increased compliance costs.The first phase, an assessment of impacts on local governments, consistedof two components. First, the cost of compliance was reviewed relativeto the overall financial capability of the community. Financial capability(or financial health) was determined from the ``1982 Census of Governments''and the ``1983 County and City Data Book.'' These data bases representthe most recent available and complete information on local governmentfinances (as government censuses are conducted every five years). As describedin the RIA, the Agency assessed financial capability by developing a compositescore. The score categorizes communities' financial capabilities as weak,average, or strong.The financial capability score of a community will not change significantlydue to compliance costs from the imposition of the proposed rule becausemany of the indicators used to develop the score are not directly affectedby increased operating expenditures. In addition, it would not be appropriateto presuppose the reaction of a community to higher landfill costs. Somecommunities will increase taxes while others will reallocate availablefunds to meet the regulatory burden. In the area of debt impact, it alsois not clear how a given project will be financed. Many communities willuse pay-as-you-go financing as they always have, others will incur debt,and the remainder will turn to private contractors who will raise theirown capital.The development and categorization of the composite score is describedin detail in the RIA. The economic impact analysis results presented inthis section of the Preamble focus on comparisons of compliance costs togovernment and demographic indicators as described below.The second component of the community impact analysis consisted of calculatingcompliance costs as a percentage of total current community expenditures(CPE) and comparing this ratio to a threshold level. The CPE indicatorserves as a convenient summary of the local government's ability to pay.The second phase of the economic impact analysis consisted of comparingcompliance costs to the ability of citizens to pay. This comparison isappropriate because, ultimately, the burden will fall on the citizens,regardless of whether the local government pays for the increased MSWLFcosts by increasing taxes, reducing other services, increasing debt levels,or turning to private contractors. EPA has assessed the absolute impactin terms of total cost per household (CPH). EPA has measured the relativeimpact using costs as a percentage of median household income (CPMHI).Both CPH and CPMHI are compared to selected threshold levels. When combined,these various analyses produce an overall indication of the significanceof municipal economic impacts for specific regulatory options.For this analysis, the Agency selected threshold levels to identify highimpacts for the three primary economic measures (i.e., CPE, CPH, CPMHI).For CPE, preliminary results from the Facility Survey indicate that municipalsolid waste disposal costs average approximately 0.5 percent of communities'total expenditures. In comparison to other municipal services, costs atthis level represent a very small obligation. Data from the ``1982 Censusof Governments'' indicate that the average community spends 36 percentof its total budget on education, 5-percent of its total budget for policeprotection, 3-percent for sewage disposal, 2-percent for fire protection,and 1-percent for sanitation services other than sewage (including solidwaste collection and disposal and street cleaning). Based on these data,the Agency established a threshold for identifying high impacts as onepercent of compliance costs relative to total community expenditures. The Agency used two threshold levels to assess the severity of costs perhousehold. An incremental regulatory cost of $100 per household per yearwas selected as a threshold for moderate impacts. Although this cost representsa large percentage increase in many households' disposal costs, it representsa relatively small absolute charge. An annual threshold of $220 per householdwas used to identify severe impacts. This threshold level is equivalentto one percent of the median household income of all the communities inthe country according to the ``1983 City and County Data Book.''The Agency has previously selected a threshold level for costs as a percentageof median household income under the Construction Grants Program. The criteriaranged from one percent of median household income for low-income communitiesto 1.75 percent of MHI for high-income communities. The Agency selectedone percent in this analysis to identify a high impact level for CPMHI.<T3>b. Economic Impact Results. </T3>Table 6 shows the percentage of communitiesunder each regulatory scenario that have compliance costs exceeding onepercent of total current community expenditures, the percentage of allpeople that reside in these communities, and the maximum CPE under eachoption.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,tp10,s25,7,7,5</C><T4>Table </T4>6._<T4>Costs as Percentage of Expenditures</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Regulatory Options]</ITAG><H1>Regulatory scenario </H1><H1>Percent of communities with CPE</H1>andgreater;1% <H1>Percent of people with CPE</H1>andgreater;1% <H1>Maximum CPE (percent)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Proposal: 10-meter POC <D>16 </D><D>7 </D><D>4.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Proposal: 150-meter POC <D>11 </D><D>4 </D><D>5.3 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Alternative 1 <D>68 </D><D>34 </D><D>14.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Alternative 2 <D>33 </D><D>12 </D><D>6.3 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Alternative 3 <D>10 </D><D>3 </D><D>8.6</D></ITAG></ITAG>EPA estimates that greater than one-half of all communities under Alternative1 have CPE exceeding one percent. Under Alternative 2, 33 percent of allgovernmental entities have CPEs that fall in this category. The percentageof municipalities with costs above 1-percent of current expenditures underthe proposal is much lower: 16 percent and 11 percent, given the 10-meterPOC and 150-meter POC, respectively. Because most of these severely-impactedcommunities are small, the percentage of the total U.S. population thatresides in these communities is much smaller than the percentage of communitiesaffected (as shown in Table 6).Several factors will tend to mitigate the actual impact of the alternativeson communities with high CPE. One important factor is the relatively smallproportion of the municipal budget that is usually devoted to municipalsolid waste disposal. Although CPE greater than 1-percent indicates thatmunicipal solid waste disposal expenditures may double in many communities,after regulation these expenditures will still represent less than 2-percentof the total municipal budget in most communities. Although it may be difficultfor communities to cope with large percentage increases in municipal solidwaste disposal costs in the short run, once the initial adjustment is made,these costs should be easier for communities to absorb because they comprisea very small portion of communities' total budgets.Table 7 shows the average CPH across the entire nation, maximum CPH, andpercentage of all communities with costs per household exceeding $100 peryear (the moderate impact level). The Agency estimates that average incrementalCPH across the entire nation ranges from $5 under Alternative 3 to $40under Alternative 1. For the proposal, EPA estimates that the average CPHis $11 at the 10-meter POC and $8 at 150-meter POC.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>7._<T4>Average Cost Per Household Per Year</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">(Regulatory Options)</ITAG><H1>Regulatory scenario</H1><H1>Average CPH</H1><H1>Percent of communities with CPH andgreater; $100 (percent)</H1><H1>Maximum CPH</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Proposal: 10-meter POC<D>$11</D><D>0.2</D><D>$119</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Proposal: 150-meter POC<D>8</D><D>2.1</D><D>253</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Alternative 1<D>40</D><D>23.5</D><D>335</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Alternative 2<D>17</D><D>0.1</D><D>160</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Alternative 3<D>5</D><D>0.2</D><D>178</D></ITAG></ITAG>EPA has selected, for this analysis, a threshold level for severe impactson households of $220 per year. The Agency estimates that this thresholdis exceeded under Alternative 1 and at the 150-meter POC for the proposal,but only by fewer than 0.1 percent of all communities in both cases. Whenthe $100 per year threshold is considered, EPA estimates that, for allregulatory options except Alternative 1, the percentage of communitiesthat exceed this level is low (i.e., less than 3-percent). However, underAlternative 1, EPA estimates that 23.5 percent of all communities experienceincreases in CPH of greater than $100 per year.Cost per household as a percentage of MHI is relatively low across allof the regulatory options. The Agency estimates that the 1-percent thresholdlevel is exceeded under the proposal at the 150-meter POC and under Alternative1. Even under these regulatory options, fewer than 2-percent of all householdsfall into the high impact-category (0.1 percent exceed the threshold atthe 150-meter POC and 1.1 percent for Alternative 1). EPA estimates thatthe maximum CPMHI is 1.3 percent under the proposal at the 150-meter POCand 1.7 percent under Alternative 1.Impacts on households also depend on who owns the landfill that servesthose households. Table 8 indicates the number of communities and landfillsby each major ownership category_county, city, village or town, private,and other. (The other category covers landfills owned by nonlocal governmentsincluding special districts, States, and the Federal government.) The distributionof communities by ownership type looks somewhat different than the distributionof landfills by ownership type because county-owned and private landfillstend to serve a larger number of communities than city or town landfills.The table indicates that communities served by village or town landfillshave much higher CPH than average. These landfills tend to serve only oneor two communities and are commonly very small, thus the CPH is higher.Communities served by private landfills tend to have lower than averageCPH. These landfills usually serve many communities and, on average, arelarger than publicly owned landfills. Smaller communities could reducethe regulatory burden by participating in larger regional landfills.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>8,L2,i1,s100,12,12,12,12,12,12,12</C><T4>Table </T4>8._<T4>Number of Communities and Landfills by Type of Owner</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Average Community CPH for Proposed Rule]</ITAG><H1>Owner</H1><H1>Communities</H1><H2>Number</H2><H2>Percent</H2><H1>Landfills</H1><H2>Number</H2><H2>Percent</H2><H1>Average number of communities per landfill</H1><H1>Average Community CPH </H1><H2>Fed POC</H2><H2>State POC</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">County<D>10,618</D><D>37</D><D>1,760</D><D>29</D><D>6.0</D><D>$18</D><D>$13</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">City<D>6,622</D><D>23</D><D>1,743</D><D>29</D><D>3.8</D><D>16</D><D>15</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Village or Town<D>2,115</D><D>7</D><D>1,182</D><D>20</D><D>1.8</D><D>34</D><D>31</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Private<D>8,556</D><D>30</D><D>912</D><D>15</D><D>9.4</D><D>10</D><D>10</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Other<D>1,087</D><D>4</D><D>427</D><D>8</D><D>2.6</D><D>15</D><D>15</D><R>n,s,s,s,s,s,s,s</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Total</ITAG><D>28,998 </D>b<D>100 </D>a<D>6,024 </D>b<D>100 </D>a<D>4.8</D><D>$16</D><D>$14</D><F/>a Totals may not add to 100 percent because of rounding.<F/>b Data are missing for 10 landfills in 19 communities.</ITAG>As stated previously, the costs used in the economic impact analysis representa reasonable upper-bound estimate. Several opportunities exist for communitiesto reduce the regulatory burden: Regionalization to share the economiesof scale at larger landfills, shifts to resource recovery facilities, increasesin the rate of recycling to reduce the waste volume for disposal, and bettersiting of new MSWLFs in ``good'' locations. (As explained above, EPA hasnot incorporated these mitigating factors into the analysis because theyinvolve site-specific local decisions that are difficult to predict.)<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Risk Assessment</ITAG><T3>a. Methodology. </T3>The Subtitle D MSWLF universe consists of a diversegroup of facilities that occur in a wide variety of environmental settings.Hundreds of factors affect the nature, extent, and severity of environmentalimpacts from these facilities. To identify and evaluate some of the mostimportant factors, EPA developed the Subtitle D Disk Model. This modelcouples information from case studies and other sources with a series ofmathematical formulations of engineering, physiochemical, hydrologic, toxicologic,and socioeconomic processes that govern impacts to provide a frameworkthat allows evaluation of regulatory options.Although the Subtitle D Risk Model has been neither peer reviewed nor verified,EPA has used it in its preliminary form to help analyze: (1) Problems associatedwith Subtitle D facilities under the current set of Criteria (i.e., baseline),(2) estimates of the level of risk reduction available from preventivemeasures (liners, leachate collection systems and covers), and (3) remedialmeasures (corrective action) under various regulatory options. For eachregulatory alternative, risk and resource damage has been modeled in hundredsof scenarios that represent unique combinations of landfill size and design,environmental setting, and exposure distance. EPA has estimated the frequencyfor which each scenario occurs in the total population of MSWLFs and weightedthe results for each scenario reflect the frequency of occurrence. Thefollowing is an overview of the risk model.(1) The Subtitle D Risk Model. The Subtitle D Risk Model provides: (1)An analytic framework for estimating human health risk reduction and otherbenefits of regulatory options, (2) a direct link between estimates ofbenefits and costs of regulations, and (3) scenarios that contain differentcombinations of design, waste, environment, and response. The model buildsdirectly on the Subtitle C Liner Location Risk and Cost Analysis Model(Ref. 20), and has adopted many of its basic characteristics. It is a dynamicmodel. For this analysis, EPA simulated 100 years of leachate release and200 years of gound-water transport for each year's release. Environmentalfate and transport and dose-response relationships are modeled as deterministicprocesses, while containment system failure and some hydrologic eventsare considered stochastic phenomena. The model only assesses effects onground water as the environmental medium of concern: ecosystem risks andsubsurface gas and surface water pathways (which also would contributeto risk) are not analyzed. Some parameters can be varied over a wide range;for others, the user selects from specified, generic values.The model includes a series of submodels that simulate pollutant release(liner failure and leachate quality submodels), fate and transport (unsaturatedzone and saturated zone transport submodels), exposure, impacts (dose-responseand resource damage submodels), and corrective action. Following are briefsummaries of each of these submodels.<T3>(a) Pollutant Release. </T3>The Agency used Monte Carlo simulationin the failure/release submodel to estimate the probability and time offailure (defined as release to the unsaturated zone) for MSWLFs and toestimate the quantity of leachate released. The submodel uses a fault treestructure that traces each possible failure event from all possible combinationsof basic events (e.g., liner failure, infiltration of liquid) that couldcombine to cause failure. Each of these basic events is assumed to occurat random, following specified probability distributions. The model providesdistributions of the year of failure and the release rate. EPA used themodel to simulate the performance of several combinations of containmentand cover systems in eight environmental settings.The leachate quality submodel simulates the concentrations of chemicalconstituents in leachate released from the MSWLF between years 1 and 100.Given differences in the leaching behavior of constituents, the submodelutilizes three different modeling approaches to simulate the concentrationsof inorganics, biodegradable organics, and synthetic organics in leachate.The submodel applies the appropriate algorithm to calculate the concentrationof each leachate constituent for each year. The concentration then is combinedwith the release volume calculated by the failure/release submodel to calculatethe mass flux of the constituent across the landfill/subgrade boundary.One representative leachate, consisting of eight constituents of concern(COC), was simulated. This leachate is intended to represent typical leachatesgenerated from co-disposal of municipal solid waste, nonhazardous industrialwaste, and VSQG hazardous waste. EPA selected the COC based on analyzinglimited leachate data from only 44 operating MSWLFs. The COC were selectedbased on potential for causing human health risk or resource damage giventheir observed median concentrations in municipal solid waste leachate,toxicity to humans, regulatory limits under SDWA taste and odor thresholds,and mobility and persistence in the subsurface environment. The eight COCand the effect of concern for each are given below:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s25,r50</C> <H1>Constituent</H1><H1>Criterion effect</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Vinyl chloride <D>Human health risk (cancer).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Arsenic <D>Human health risk (cancer).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Iron <D>Resource damage (taste and odor).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,1,2,2, - tetrachloroethane <D>Human health risk (cancer).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Dichloromethane <D>Human health risk (cancer).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Antimony <D>Human health risk (systemic).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Carbon tetrachloride <D>Human health risk (cancer).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Phenol <D>Rsource damage (taste and odor).</D></ITAG></ITAG><T3>(b) Fate and Transport. </T3>Subsurface transport modeling addressestransport through both the unsaturated zone and the saturated zone. TheSubtitle D Risk Model uses the McWhorter-Nelson wetting front equationto calculate the delay between the time of failure and the time that contaminantsreach an underlying aquifer. The mass that breaks through the unsaturatedzone then disperses through the ground water. Using an adaptation of theRandom-Walk Solute Transport Model (Ref. 25) developed by Prickett, Naymik,and Londquist, the saturated zone model simulates downgradient ground-waterconcentrations over time.To model the transport of constituents, EPA developed eight environmentalsettings consisting of four net infiltration regimes (0.25-inch, 1-inch,10-inch, and 20-inch) and two categories of ground-water depths (deep andshallow). These two parameters are important in affecting the release rateof leachate to the unsaturated zone and ultimately the aquifer. Net infiltrationrepresents the amount of water that can enter the landfill as a resultof precipitation. Ground-water table depth represents the potential forpollutant attenuation and degradation to occur in the unsaturated zone.In addition, for facilities that are seasonally inundated with ground water,the inundation depth determines the rate at which ground water can flowthrough the waste.EPA performed a statistical analysis of USGS data for each infiltrationcategory to determine the mean depth to ground water and the average annualground-water fluctuation. Shallow and deep water table depths are representedby the 50th and 90th percentiles, respectively.For transport through the saturated zone, EPA developed 11 generic ground-waterflow fields to represent the range of hydrogeologic conditions in the UnitedStates. The flow fields are based on data collected from ground-water supplyreports for each of the USGS regions. The flow fields vary in terms ofaquifer configuration, materials, and flow velocity. Five of the flow fieldsare single-layer aquifer systems, two contain two adjacent aquifers, threeconsist of an aquifer overlaid with a nonaquifer, and one contains twoaquifers separated by a nonaquifer.EPA assigned each surveyed landfill to a net infiltration region basedon its precipitation level (obtained from the nearest National WeatherStation) and other climatic data. Each of these MSWLFs also was assigneda DRASTIC (Ref. 39) setting to select appropriate ground-water table depthsand flow fields. These assignments were used to develop a frequency distributionfor each environmental setting. EPA used these frequency weights to scaleup the risk model results to obtain national estimates.<T3>(c) Exposure Distance and Populations. </T3>EPA selected seven welldistances for modeling risk: 10 meters, 60 meters, 200 meters, 400 meters,600 meters, 1,000 meters, and 1,500 meters. Preliminary results from theFacility Survey were used to develop a frequency distribution of distancefrom the MSWLF to the closest drinking water well at each site. This distribution(i.e., distance to closest well) was used to estimate risk to the maximumexposed individual (MEI). Approximately 54 percent of the MSWLFs were reportedto have no downgradient drinking water well within one mile of the facility.For the other 46 percent of MSWLFs: 12.8 percent reported wells within300 meters, 22.5 percent reported wells within 500 meters, and 40.3 percentreported wells within 1,250 meters of the facility boundary.EPA used the preliminary Facility Survey data on distance to all wellswithin one mile downgradient and the number of people served at each wellto calculate the total population risk (i.e., number of predicted cancercases). EPA calculated the mean number of well-using people per acre (i.e.,1.6) using facility survey results for private and/or public wells. Theland area associated with each exposure well was multiplied by this populationdensity to estimate the size of the exposed population for each affectedwell.Ground-water concentrations of chemical constituents released from landfillscan cause human exposure via drinking water. All exposed individuals areassumed to weigh 70 kilograms and drink two liters of water per day. Thelifetime dose is calculated as the running 70-year average over an individual'slifetime.<T3>(d) Impacts: Human Health Risk. </T3>For this analysis, reported riskis the average lifetime maximum exposed individual risk (i.e., the meanof the average lifetime (70-year) risks over the 300-year modeling period).Of the eight COC selected for modeling human health risk, five are carcinogensand one is a noncarcinogen. The approach for estimating risks for carcinogeniceffects is consistent with the Agency's cancer risk assessment guidelines.Carcinogenic potencies are from the Agency's Carcinogenic Assessment Group(i.e., 95th percentile upper-bound slopes based on a linearized multistagemodel).For noncarcinogenic effects, the Weilbull equation was used with a thresholdto predict a probability of effect. Below the threshold, risk equals zero.At doses above the threshold, risk depends on the dose, the constituent-specificthreshold, and the shape of the dose-response curve.<T3>(e) Impacts: Resource Damage. </T3>The measure of resource damage inthe model is based on the cost to replace contaminated ground water thatcurrently is used, or may be used, for drinking water. Resource damageis determined by plume area, the density of drinking water wells, the sourceof replacement water and its distance from the affected wells, the timethe plume first appears, and whether ground water currently is used.The Agency assumed that the replacement source is nearby ground water locatedone mile distant. The replacement well system was designed using the meanpopulation density of 1.6 people per acre that also was used for the humanhealth risk estimates.Resource damage was estimated under two scenarios: use value and optionvalue. Use value assumes that the population currently is using the groundwater, whereas option value is used when the population is not currentlyusing the resource but may wish to do so in the future. For option value,the resource damage measure recognizes the probabilistic nature of futureuse; replacement costs are multiplied by an estimated probability of usein each time period. The present value for both option and use value isthen determined at a 3-percent real discount rate.<T3>(f) Corrective Action. </T3>Under the proposed rule, corrective actioncan be triggered if a constituent of concern is detected in the uppermostaquifer at levels exceeding the applicable MCL; if an MCL does not exist,a risk-based or background level is used as the standard.In the corrective action analysis for this RIA, ground-water monitoringwells are located at the POC, which can vary between the landfill unitand the property boundary depending on the regulatory scenario. EPA estimatedthe effects of corrective action based on detection of constituents ofconcern in the uppermost aquifer at levels exceeding a 1andmultiply;10^5risk level.As stated in the cost methodology, only ground-water recovery wells weremodeled as the corrective action technology. The submodel assumes thatthe corrective action technology is in place one year after the triggerlevels are reached and operates at its specified efficiency for the remainderof the modeling period. The model calculates downgradient well concentrationprofiles following implementation of the corrective action and recalculatesrisk and resource damage estimates. These results are compared to the estimatescalculated for the baseline (i.e., no corrective action scenario) to determinethe reductions in risk and resource damage achieved by corrective action.(2) Risk Model Inputs. EPA modeled three MSWLF sizes for risk and resourcedamage: 10 TPD, 175 TPD, and 750 TPD. Each size category is characterizedby the total volume of waste placed in the landfill, the number of phasesused to dispose of the waste, and the dimensions of the landfill at capacity(e.g., surface area, depth, height). The waste volumes and dimensions foreach capacity category are consistent with the cost model described earlier.The number of phases in the risk analysis are 2, 5, and 10 for the 10,175, and 750 TPD landfills, respectively.As with the cost model, EPA used the Facility Survey to estimate the frequencywith which each landfill size category occurs nationwide. Landfills withcapacities of up to 30 TPD are included in the 10 TPD category, 30 to 500TPD landfills are in the 175 TPD units, and those with larger capacitiesare modeled as 750 TPD. Using this approach, 61.5 percent of the landfillswere modeled at 10 TPD, 33.1 percent as 175 TPD, and 5.5 percent as 750TPD. The Agency assumed that facility size is independent of hydrogeologicand exposure attributes.All new MSWLFs are assumed to operate for 20 years. The baseline facilityis the same as that used in the cost analysis but risks and resource damageestimates (for the proposal) were not adjusted to reflect existing Staterequirements for containment systems. This adjustment for liners and leachatecollection systems would affect no more than 17 percent of all MSWLFs.To assess the effectiveness of a regulatory option, EPA assumed that anew landfill is constructed at the same site and operated for 20 yearsplus post-closure care according to the applicable requirements.Under the proposed option, MSWLF units are required to meet a performancestandard by applying appropriate cover and containment designs. Ownersor operators have the freedom to choose the type of design they think willmeet the performance standard. Because the performance and costs of designelements such as liners and covers are highly dependent on site-specificfactors, there are likely to be several types of designs (and combinationsof designs) chosen by the regulated community to comply with the performancestandard.As stated previously, to analyze the proposed rule, EPA assigned containmentand cover designs to new MSWLFs according to a 10^5 design goal (chosenfrom the allowable protective range of 1andmultiply;10^4 to 1andmultiply;10^7).In addition, EPA assigned one of three containment and cover designs underthe assumption that owners or operators will use the least stringent designcapable of meeting the design goal (EPA recognizes that other control technologiesbeyond the three analyzed could be used to comply with the performancestandard). If the most stringent of the three designs did not reduce riskto this level, corrective action would be triggered.Landfills with average lifetime risks below 1andmultiply;10^5 given the baselinedesign (unlined with a vegetative cover) were excluded from further designrequirements. Landfills with higher risks were assigned a synthetic coverand, if risks for an MSWLF unit still exceeded the design goal, the moststringent design of a synthetic liner, synthetic cover, and leachate collectionsystem was assigned. For existing facilities, EPA used the baseline riskswith a 1andmultiply;10^5 cutoff to assign either a synthetic cover (for thosewith greater than 1andmultiply;10^5 baseline risks) or a vegetative cover(for those with less than 1andmultiply;10^5 baseline risks).For this analysis, EPA assumed that extended care continues for 80 yearsafter the end of the active life of the MSWLF, and includes maintenanceof the vegetative portion of the cover, ground-water monitoring, and correctiveaction (although an extended care period is analyzed in the RIA, the actualproposed rule requires a two-phased post-closure care period of at least30 years). For designs with synthetic covers, EPA assumed that the syntheticcomponents would be maintained and replaced if necessary until the endof the first 30 years of post-closure care.EPA modeled Alternatives 1 through 3 in a manner consistent with the costanalysis. A detailed discussion on how EPA estimated risk and resourcedamage for the regulatory alternatives is included in the RIA.<T3>b. Risk Results. </T3>This part presents results of the risk analysis(including resource damage) for the baseline and each of the regulatoryoptions.(1) Baseline. For the baseline, EPA estimates that average MEI risks overthe 300-year modeling period range from approximately 1andmultiply;10^4 tozero. Results from the Facility Survey indicate that about 54 percent oflandfills have no drinking water wells within one mile of the facilityboundary. Because the model only estimates human health risks at drinkingwater wells within one mile of the facility, EPA assigned these facilities(54 percent of all MSWLFs) no human health risk. EPA recognizes that iffuture wells are located near existing landfills, this subgroup (54 percent)of all MSWLFs would face potential risks in the baseline from contaminatedground water similar to those that currently have nearby wells. Another6 percent have nearby wells, but have no risk (MEI less than or equal to1andmultiply;10^10) because no constituents reach the wells within the modelingperiod. Risks are low (1andmultiply;10^6 to 1andmultiply;10^8) or very low(less than 1andmultiply;10^8) for a total of 82.8 percent of MSWLFs (theseMSWLFs include the 54 percent of all facilities) that have no drinkingwater wells within one mile and, therefore, have an assigned zero healthrisk). Of the remainder, 11.6 percent have moderate risk (i.e., in the1andmultiply;10^6 to 1andmultiply;10^5 range), 5.5 percent have high risk (1andmultiply;10^5to 1andmultiply;10^4), and a negligible 0.05 percent exceed 1andmultiply;10^4.Across all units in the baseline, less than 20 percent have risks greaterthan 1andmultiply;10^6. EPA recognizes that future increases in well densitynear MSWLFs would increase baseline risks from those estimated.The principal constituents contributing to the risk estimates from themodel are vinyl chloride, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane, and dichloromethane(methylene chloride). These risk (and resource damage) estimates are basedon observed median concentrations. The Agency estimates that the risk associatedwith the 90th percentile levels in the leachate data would be about oneorder of magnitude higher than that simulated for the median concentrations.This risk occurs because carcinogens are the primary contributors to riskin this analysis, cancer risk varies linearly with dose, and the reported90th percentile concentrations are about one order of magnitude higherthan the median levels. The leachate data on which these risk estimatesare made are extremely limited. Therefore, the risk estimates could changesignificantly with more comprehensive leachate data.The Agency estimates that 0.0770 cancer cases per year in the baselinecan be expected over the 300-year modeling period. EPA has only estimatedrisks from drinking ground water, and, therefore, additional risks wouldexist from other routes of exposure (e.g., surface water, subsurface gas,and ecosystem risk). Risks attributable to existing contamination alsoare not considered.Moreover, if future wells are located near existing MSWLFs (or new sitesare located near current wells), the overall risk distribution will reflectthe estimates for the subset of landfills that currently have wells withinone mile of the facility boundary. For this subgroup of the population,nearly 40 percent of landfills have risks exceeding 1andmultiply;10^6. Inaddition, the median risk is about 4.3andmultiply;10^7.EPA performed a sensitivity analysis of the baseline risk results to thewell distance distribution. When all landfills are assumed to have wellsat the facility boundary (modeled as 10 meters downgradient from the wasteunit boundary for this sensitivity analysis) risk changes dramatically.While less than 20 percent of all MSWLFs have risks exceeding 1andmultiply;10^6for the actual well distribution, over 67 percent exceed this risk levelwhen all exposure is assumed to occur at the 10-meter boundary. The results of the analysis identify several factors that are importantin determining risk, namely facility size, distance to nearest well, andenvironmental setting. These factors interact with many others in a complexmanner to produce risk. Higher levels of contamination and, thus, higher risks are associated withlarger facilities that have a greater mass of waste. The high percentageof small facilities (less than 30 tons per day) in the regulated universetends to weigh the overall distribution to lower risk levels. However,the Agency's economic impact results indicate that smaller communitieswill have incentive to regionalize their landfill operations in order toshare the burden of cost increases with other communities as well as totake advantage of the economies of scale associated with larger facilities.Regionalization would shift the overall risk distribution towards the higherrisks associated with larger facilities, although the total number of facilitieswould be reduced. All other factors held constant, risk decreases with increasing distancefrom the facility. Contaminant concentrations diminish over distance dueto degradation, dispersion, and attenuation. While the closest wells presentthe greatest risk, results from the Facility Survey indicate that thisoccurrence is relatively rare: 54 percent of existing MSWLFs have no wellswithin one mile, 15 percent have wells within 300 meters, and 25 percenthave wells within 500 meters. However, as stated above, the proximity ofwells to MSWLFs likely will increase in the future and thus baseline risksand the risk reduction attributable to the proposal would be greater thanthe estimates based on the current well distribution. Wetter climates are associated with higher release volumes and consequentlygreater risks. However, because landfills are almost equally likely tobe found in wet or arid climates, no one infiltration rate setting hasa dominant influence on the overall risk distribution. Hydrogeologic characteristicsof the aquifer also exert a strong influence on risk. Aquifer propertiesaffect the extent of dilution of the leachate and the retardation and degradationof specific pollutants. Aquifers with slow velocities (i.e., one meterper year) generally allow for no pollutant breakthrough at the more distantwells and for considerable pollutant degradation before breakthrough atnearby wells. In the high-velocity flow fields (i.e., 1,000 and 10,000meters per year), considerably more water flows through the aquifer, whichaffords more dilution of the leachate. Intermediate velocity aquifers (i.e.,10 and 100 meters per year) have higher risk profiles because they neitherallow for much degradation nor provide for much dilution or pollutant dispersion.Although these factors (i.e., facility size, distance from the facility,infiltration rate, aquifer characteristics) are strong determinants ofrisk, no single factor is responsible for most of the variability. Allof these factors, plus others that were not accounted for in EPA's riskmodeling, interact in a complex manner to produce risk. (2) Regulatory Options. This Subpart will present first the results forthe 10-meter POC modeled at 10 meters from the waste boundary and thenthe 150-meter POC modeled at 150 meters from the waste boundary. For the 10-meter POC, EPA estimated that, for about 61 percent of all landfills,vegetative covers alone are sufficient to meet a 1andmultiply;10^5 risk-basedperformance standard. Synthetic covers are sufficient for 11 percent ofthe landfills, while synthetic liners with leachate collection systemsand synthetic covers are needed at the remaining 28 percent. About 40 percentof the landfills with synthetic liners and covers (11 percent of all landfills)trigger corrective action under the proposal. About 0.1 percent of the landfills have risks exceeding 1andmultiply;10^5under the proposal, compared to 5.6 percent in the baseline and about 35percent have risks between 1andmultiply;10^8 and 1andmultiply;10^5. Populationrisks for the proposal are 0.0210 cancer cases per year (over the 300-yearmodeling period), down from a baseline of 0.0770 cases per year. At the 150-meter POC, EPA estimated that about 79 percent of the landfillsare in compliance with the performance standard in the baseline (comparedto 61 percent with the 10-meter POC). About 9 percent need synthetic coversand the remaining 13 percent need synthetic liners and covers. About 5percent of all landfills trigger corrective action. As with the 10-meter POC, the number of landfills with risks exceeding1andmultiply;10^5 is reduced from 5.6 percent in the baseline to about 0.1percent at the 150-meter POC. About 86 percent of the landfills have riskslower than 1andmultiply;10^6 under this option, compared to 83 percent inthe baseline. Population risks are 0.0227 cancer cases per year (over the300-year modeling period), down from a baseline of 0.0770 cases per year.Under Alternative 1, less than 1 percent of the MSWLFs have high risk (greaterthan 1andmultiply;10^5), compared to 5.6 percent in the baseline. Approximately6.1 percent have moderate risks (1andmultiply;10^6 to 1andmultiply;10^5) comparedto 11.6 percent in the baseline; 15.2 percent have low risks (1andmultiply;10^8to 1andmultiply;10^6); and the remaining 78.7 percent have very low or norisks. Corrective action is never triggered during the first 50 years under Alternative1, so all of the risk reduction results from the containment system andcover. Overall, about 9 percent of the landfills trigger corrective actionunder Alternative 1. The cover reduces the amount of infiltration enteringthe landfill. Before leachate is released from the MSWLF, both syntheticmembranes must fail, and the leachate then must travel through three feetof clay. Due to this delay, which ranges from 52 to over 100 years, someof the pollutant mass that would otherwise have been released is not releasedduring the modeling period. The delay also results in additional pollutantdegradation prior to release. The leachate collection systems remove someof the pollutant mass from the landfill. EPA estimates that population risks under Alternative 1 are 0.0086 cancercases per year (over the 300-year modeling period), reduced from the estimateof 0.0770 cancer cases per year in the baseline.Under Alternative 2, risk shifts from the moderate- and high-risk rangesto the low and very low categories. Only 0.03 percent of the landfillshave risks exceeding 1andmultiply;10^5, and 7.9 percent have risks between1andmultiply;10^6 and 1andmultiply;10^5, compared to 5.6 and 11.6 percent inthe baseline, respectively. The percentage of landfills with risks below1andmultiply;10^6 increases from about 83 percent in the baseline to about92 percent under Alternative 2. The expected number of cancer cases underAlternative 2 is 0.0105 per year (over the 300-year modeling period), comparedto 0.0770 in the baseline.Under Alternative 3, 0.003 percent of landfills have risks higher than1andmultiply;10^4, and 1.8 percent have risks between 1andmultiply;10^5 and1andmultiply;10^4. The percentage with risks between 1andmultiply;10^6 and1andmultiply;10^5 decreases from 11.6 in the baseline to 8.7 percent underAlternative 3. Population risks under this alternative are 0.0216 cancercases per year over the 300-year modeling period.Of all the alternatives considered, EPA believes the proposed rule is likelyto effectively reduce risk because of the performance standard nature ofthe proposal. Risk depends on a complex interaction among site-specificfactors. This variability affects not only the occurrence of risk, butalso the effectiveness of a particular design. Expressing a regulationin terms of performance allows for the implementation of design and operatingprocedures that best address site-specific risk factors. Overall, EPA believesthat risk is likely to be very low under the proposed option.Although Alternative 3 requires extended care, it does not require linersor leachate collection systems. With this design, many landfills, particularlythose located in the wetter climates, will release leachate to the aquiferduring the unit's active life. As a result of these early releases, EPAestimates that corrective action will be triggered more often than underthe proposal (39 percent compared to 5 and 11 percent). Because of theuncertainty in the effectiveness of corrective action, risk may be higherunder this alternative than estimated in the RIA (this uncertainty, however,is not easily modeled). Alternative 3 represents a reactive approach topotential contamination compared to preventive approaches such as the proposedor Alternative 2, in which landfill design is based in part on achievinga performance standard.Table 9 shows the number of cancer cases expected annually over the 300-yearmodeling period, and the reduction in annual population risk for each regulatoryoption. As estimated by EPA, the reductions in risk are similar among allthe regulatory options.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s10,9,7.4</C><T4>Table </T4>9._<T4>Predicted Population Risk Across </T4>6,034 <T4>New MSWLF's </T4><H1>Regulatory scenario</H1><H1>Cases per year \1\</H1><H1>Reduction (Cases/year)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Baseline <D>0.0770 </D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Proposal: 10-meter POC<D>.0210 </D><D>0.0560</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Proposal: 150-meter POC<D>.0227</D><D>.0543</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Alternative 1<D>.0036</D><D>.0659</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Alternative 2<D>.0105</D><D>.065</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Alternative 3<D>.0216</D><D>.0554</D><F>\1\ Total population risk over the 300-year simulation period dividedby 300.</F></ITAG></ITAG><T3>c. Resource Damage Results.</T3> Consistent with the risk analysis,resource damage estimates are made for the baseline, proposed rule, andeach regulatory alternative. As discussed in the methodology section, resourcedamage is measured as the replacement cost (expressed in present valueterms) to provide water to users whose supply is contaminated by releasesof leachate from MSWLFs. Similar to the risk analysis, EPA has not consideredthe surface water pathway in the resource damage analysis. Resource damageestimates (modeled for new facilities only) do not take into account existingState requirements for containment systems.(1) Baseline. The Agency estimates significant resource damage in the baselinefor MSWLFs ranging from $0 to more than $4 million. The majority of MSWLFs,however, have resource damages valued at less than $200,000; this resultlargely reflects the option value estimate for the 54 percent of all MSWLFsthat have no drinking water wells within one mile of the facility. EPApredicts that about 29 percent of MSWLFs will have no resource damage.Approximately 31 percent of landfills have resource damage exceeding $200,000,and about 13 percent have resource damage in excess of $1 million. Thetwo components of resource damage are not option value and use value. Becauseoption value is based on the probability that a ground-water source maysomeday be used, it tends to be much lower than use value for a given setof conditions; option value is estimated to be typically one-tenth of usevalue. Option value dominates at lower levels of resource damage whileuse value is the only measure to appear at levels exceeding $400,000.When both use and option value are considered, the median resource damageis about $79,000. 13-percent of the MSWLFs have damages exceeding $1 million,and 7-percent have damages exceeding $2 million. If only use value is considered,the median estimate for resource damage for this subset of landfills (i.e.,the 46 percent of all MSWLFs that report drinking water wells within onemile) is about $485,000, and almost 28 percent of these MSWLFs have damagesthat exceed $1 million.The total resource damage for all 6,034 MSWLFs in the baseline is approximately$2.58 billion.Facility size, distance to nearest well, and environmental setting havean influence on resource damage similar to their influence on the riskestimates presented earlier.Generally, the resource damage estimates are heavily dependent on the currentstatus of ground-water use, plume size, and the timing of contamination.Because ground water in the vicinity of more than half the MSWLFs is notcurrently used, most contamination causes resource damage that has relativelylow present value. In some cases, however, resource damage can be extensive,valued at as much as $5 million. Environmental factors have an impact onresource damage by affecting plume size and its timing.(2) Regulatory Options. Resource damage under the proposal reduces thereplacement costs from the baseline. Under the proposal at the 10-meterPOC, EPA estimates that no landfills will have replacement costs exceeding$3 million (present value), compared to over 3 percent in the baseline.The fraction of landfills with replacement cost between $1 million and$3 million decreases from 9.5 percent in the baseline to 6.5 percent underthe proposal. The percentage of landfills with no resource damages is thesame for both the baseline and proposal (28.6 percent). EPA estimates thatthe total resource damage across all landfills is $1.27 billion, a reductionof $1.31 billion from the baseline estimate of $2.58 billion.Under the proposal at the 150-meter POC, the shift to lower replacementcosts is smaller than with the 10-meter POC. Under the 150-meter POC, EPAestimates that there are no landfills with resource damage greater than$3 million. Seven percent have replacement costs between $1 and $3 million,and 64.3 percent have positive resource damage less than $1 million. Thetotal resource damage across all landfills is $1.6 billion, which is $980million less than the baseline but $33 million more than under the 10-meterPOC.Under Alternative 1, no MSWLFs have replacement costs exceeding $1 million,whereas about 13 percent have replacement costs exceeding $1 million inthe baseline. The fraction of MSWLFs with replacement costs between $0.2million and $1 million decreases from one-fifth to one-tenth under Alternative1. Over half of the MSWLFs have zero resource damage with Alternative 1requirements in place, compared to 29 percent in the baseline. The totalresource damage across all MSWLFs is $410 million, a reduction of $2.17billion from the baseline.The synthetic/composite liner, double leachate collection system, and compositecover reduce resource damage for the same reasons that they reduce risk.As with risk, there is no resource damage estimated in the 0.25-inch netinfiltration region because releases do not occur within the first 100years. If the pollutant release period in the model were extended, it islikely some resource damage would be simulated. None of the reduction inresource damage results from corrective action, which is never triggeredduring the first 50 years under Alternative 1.EPA estimates that Alternative 2 effectively reduces resource damage. Virtuallynone of the landfills have resource damages exceeding $1 million, comparedto about 17 percent in the baseline. The percent of landfills with resourcedamage between $0.2 million and $1 million decreases from 15.1 percentin the baseline to 12.8 percent under Alternative 2. About 35 percent ofthe landfills have no resource damage. The total resource damage acrossall landfills decreases from $2.58 billion in the baseline to $570 millionunder Alternative 2 for a reduction of $2.01 billion.  Alternative 3 eliminates the occurrence of replacement costs higher than$4 million. About 6.4 percent of the landfills have replacement costs between$1 million and $4 million. The number of landfills with no resource damageremains virtually unchanged from the baseline at about 29 percent. Thetotal resource damage across all landfills under Alternative 3 drops from$2.58 billion to $1.57 billion as a result of corrective action.  In summary, all of the regulatory options reduce resource damage from baselinelevels. For each option, the largest reductions occur for those facilitiesthat currently have downgradient wells (i.e., resource damage is measuredin terms of use value) and install preventive measures to control releases.At these facilities, the reduction and delay in releases to the subsurfacereduce plume size and/or delay formation of plumes. Because replacementcosts are discounted, delay in plume formation translates directly intoreduced resource damage. Those facilities with no current wells have smallerbaseline resource damage (measured as option value), but also have proportionatelysmaller damage reductions because they are not as strongly affected bythe delay in leachate release. Table 10 presents the resource damage results,across all 6,034 new MSWLFs, for the regulatory options.  <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s10,8,9  </C><T4>Table </T4>10._<T4>Total Resource Damages for </T4>6,034 <T4>New Facilities  </T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Present value in billions of dollars]  </ITAG><H1>Regulatory scenario  </H1><H1>Resource damage  </H1><H1>Damage reduction  </H1>  <ITAG tagnum="1">Baseline  <D>$2.58  </D><D>  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Proposal (10-meter POC)  <D>1.27  </D><D>$1.31  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Proposal (150-State POC)  <D>1.60  </D><D>0.98  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Alternative 1  <D>0.41  </D><D>2.17  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Alternative 2  <D>0.57  </D><D>2.01  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Alternative 3  <D>1.57  </D><D>1.01  </D></ITAG></ITAG>  B. Regulatory Flexibility Act  The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) requires Federal regulatory agenciesto evaluate the impacts of regulations on small entities. The RFA requiresan initial screening analysis to determine whether the proposed rule willhave a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.  This section presents the methodology and results of the Agency's screeninganalysis for the proposed rule at the 10-meter point of compliance.  <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Methodology  </ITAG>The RFA provides some guidance in developing definitions of what constitutesa substantial number of small entities, what size criteria define a smallentity, and what is a significant impact, although it allows the Agencyto develop a more appropriate definition if necessary. The Act definesa ``substantial number'' as more than 20 percent of the affected populationof small entities. The RFA provides a definition of a small governmentalentity as any government serving a population of less than 50,000.  The RFA allows for several indicators (e.g., compliance costs as a percentageof production costs, compliance costs as a percentage of sales, numberand proportion of small entities likely to close) to be used to assesssignificant impacts. When a recommended threshold is exceeded for a givenindicator, this constitutes a ``significant impact.''  For this RFA screening analysis, the Agency used the same measures andthreshold levels as those used in the economic impact analysis. These indicators(and the corresponding threshold values) are cost as a percentage of expenditures(1-percent), cost per household ($220 per year), and cost as a percentageof median household income (1-percent).  <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Results  </ITAG>As stated in the economic impact analysis results, the threshold valuesare never exceeded for CPH or at the 10-meter POC for the proposed rule.Tables 11 and 12 present data on cost per household and cost as a percentageof expenditures for the proposed rule at the 10-meter POC. (The patternof impacts is very similar for costs as a percentage of median householdincome and is not displayed.) The two indicators show similar patternsof impact with the greatest impacts on communities with populations of5,000 or less. The threshold value for significant impact is exceeded forthe cost as a percentage of expenditures indicator.  <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>5,L2,i1,s10,5,7,8,6  </C><T4>Table </T4>11._<T4>Cost Per Household Per Year for Proposed Rule </T4>(10-<T4>Meter </T4>POC)  <ITAG tagnum="96">[Percent of households by community size]  </ITAG><H1>Population size  </H1><H1>CPH range (in percent)  </H1><H2/>andless;$25  <H2>$25-$50  </H2><H2>$50-$100  </H2><H1/>andgreater;$100    <ITAG tagnum="1">Less than 1,000  <D>72.9  </D><D>25.2  </D><D>1.9  </D><D>0.0  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,001-5,000  <D>80.8  </D><D>15.9  </D><D>3.1  </D><D>0.3  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">5,001-15,000  <D>87.5  </D><D>10.8  </D><D>1.7  </D><D>0.0  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">15,001-50,000  <D>88.9  </D><D>9.9  </D><D>1.1  </D><D>0.0  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">50,001-100,000  <D>88.5  </D><D>11.5  </D><D>0.0  </D><D>0.0  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">More than 100,000  <D>98.0  </D><D>2.0  </D><D>0.0  </D><D>0.0  </D></ITAG></ITAG>    <ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table</T4> 12._<T4>Compliance Cost as Percentage of Expenditures for Proposed Rule </T4>(10-<T4>meter POC</T4>)<ITAG tagnum="96">[Percent of communities by community size]</ITAG><H1>Population size</H1><H1>Percent of expenditures</H1><H2>0-1%</H2><H2>1-2%</H2><H2>andgreater;2%</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">Less than 1,000<D>78.8</D><D>18.9</D><D>2.3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,001 to 5,000<D>85.6</D><D>10.5</D><D>4.0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">5,001 to 15,000<D>90.0</D><D>7.8</D><D>2.2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">15,001 to 50,000<D>90.9</D><D>5.6</D><D>3.6</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">50,001 to 100,000<D>87.7</D><D>12.3</D><D>0.0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Greater than 100,000<D>100.0</D><D>0.0</D><D>0.0</D></ITAG></ITAG>Although the RFA is aimed primarily at mitigating adverse effects on smallbusinesses, it also includes a definition of small governmental entitiesas any government serving a population of less than 50,000. The municipaldata base of primary providers of local government services used for thisanalysis contains about 29,017 entities, 97.6 percent of these representa population of 50,000 or smaller. Because such a large proportion of affectedentities under the proposed rule meets the 50,000 population criterionsuggested in the RFA, and since significant adverse impacts are less onentities with a population larger than 5,000, an alternative definitionof a small entity is appropriate. There are 22,191 entities in the database with populations of 5,000 or less; this represents 77 percent of thetotal. The proposed regulation will have its most severe impacts on governmentsserving less than 1,000 people, which include 46 percent of primary localgovernments. Therefore, the Agency determined that an appropriate sizedefinition for small entities for the purpose of this analysis falls somewherebetween governments of 5,000 persons and 1,000 persons.The Agency determined that the proposed rule is likely to impose differentialeconomic impacts, although not significant impacts, on a substantial numberof small entities. The impacts are more severe on small governments thanthose on larger communities. The Agency determined that the effects ofthe proposed rule on small entities should be analyzed in greater detailas part of the final rulemaking effort.C. LimitationsThere are several important caveats to the results presented in this section.Costs and benefits for the proposed rule as estimated in the RIA representa 1 andmultiply; 10^\5\ design goal, actual effects of the proposal willvary as the State-specified-design goal varies within the allowable protectiverange of 1 andmultiply; 10^\4\ to 1 andmultiply; 10^\7\. Moreover, other designsbesides the three modeled in the RIA would be sufficient to meet the performancestandard and would influence the resulting costs and benefits. Althoughseveral provisions (e.g., post-closure care, ground-water monitoring parameters,performance standard for existing units) of the proposal do not exactlyreflect what was analyzed in the RIA, the Agency believes that the basicconclusions of the RIA are accurate estimators of the effects of the proposedrule.Compliance costs represent upper-bound estimates. Factors that may actto reduce the cost estimates including regionalization, waste shifts toresource recovery facilities, recycling, and better siting of new landfillsin ``good'' locations. As noted earlier, EPA has not incorporated thesefactors into the analysis because they involve site-specific local decisionsthat are difficult to analyze.It is unlikely that each of the existing MSWLFs will have a replacementlandfill in perpetuity as EPA has assumed in this analysis due to suchforces as regionalization. Smaller MSWLFs can achieve substantial economiesof scale that will help to reduce their compliance costs by participatingin larger regional landfills with other local governments. The economiesof scale likely will remain positive even with additional costs due totransfer stations and increased transportation distances. Although theseeconomies of scale exist, there are many local, noneconomic (e.g., political,technical) factors that enter into landfill siting that may inhibit theforces of regionalization.Future waste shifts to resource recovery facilities will divert the wastevolume that potentially needs to be landfilled, and, thus, costs presentedin this section will tend to be overstated. It is likely that solid wastecombustion will become more attractive in the future due to competitivecosts with landfilling or favorable environmental conditions at a givensite. EPA has estimated that resource recovery could divert as much as18 percent of the solid waste stream away from land disposal given futurepopulation growth and increases in the volume of solid waste generated(Ref. 16). Alternatives to land disposal other than energy recovery alsoexist (e.g., recycling, composting). These programs, although often successfuldue to their inherent flexibility and cost-effectiveness, have historicallydiverted only modest amounts of municipal solid waste from the waste stream.EPA has adjusted the compliance costs to reflect State requirements forliners, leachate collection systems, and ground-water monitoring wells;no adjustment was made in the benefits analysis, which used an unlinedunit with a vegetative cover to represent baseline conditions. Estimatedcosts may be overstated for landfills in States with other requirementsthat may be similar to the proposed rule.There are also several caveats related to the risk analysis. There is considerableuncertainty in the risk modeling. The model components that introduce themost uncertainty are those that predict: (1) Leachate quality for traceorganics, (2) the probability and consequences of containment system failure,(3) the effectiveness of corrective action, and (4) the human health riskresulting from exposure to toxic substances (i.e., the dose-response models).The risk analysis also considers only the current population that is usingthe ground water as a drinking water source. In the future, greater numbersof people and wells may be located near MSWLFs. Future population growthwould increase the risk reduction estimates presented in this discussion.If regionalization occurs so that the total number of landfills that needsto be sited is reduced, the total exposed population may also be reduced.However, EPA has shown that larger risks are associated with larger facilities.Future population growth, and a corresponding increase in solid waste generationthat may be land disposed, will also increase compliance costs over thecurrent estimates.EPA estimated only risks that are attributable to drinking contaminatedground water. Other risks from MSWLFs were not analyzed (e.g., surfacewater, subsurface gas, risks to the ecosystem). Analyzing these risks wouldresult in greater risk reduction than currently estimated. The aggregatecosts already include some of the controls that would prevent these otherforms of risk. The bulk of the compliance costs are for requirements thatserve to protect the ground water from leachate contamination.EPA's modeling period in the risk analysis is 300 years. Greater risk reductionwould be obtained if this period were extended.Many assumptions, such as those discussed above, enter into the risk analysis.Thus, strong reliance on the absolute risk estimates without full realizationof the limitations of the analysis should be avoided. Comparisons of therisk estimates across regulatory options are more reliable and valid thanabsolute estimates for a single option. EPA solicits comments and additionaldata regarding the assumptions, costs, risks, and potential impacts identifiedin the regulatory analysis.D.
