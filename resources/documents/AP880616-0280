The key index of 30 industrial stocks, which climbed 32 pointsin the prior two trading days, plummeted 37.16 points to close at2,094.24.   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5-to-2 in nationwide tradingof New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 435 issues up, 1,089down and 425 unchanged.   Volume on the floor of the NYSE came to 161.55 million shares,up from 150.26 million in the previous session. Nationwide,consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading atregional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled186.038 million shares.   Analysts had said there was a natural tendency for someprofit-taking to set in following the Dow average's impressiveadvance of late.   But the day's decline was exacerbated by disarray in the creditmarkets, which were reacting to an unsubstantiated report in a WestGermany newspaper that indicated the central Bundesbank might betightening monetary policy.   ``There are some indications that Japan might be doing the same,and that says effectively that if the Federal Reserve wants to keepthe dollar stable, it will not give interest rates much room todecline,'' said Hugh Johnson, senior vice president at First AlbanyCorp.   The Treasury's bellwether 30-year issue finished off 1| points,or down more than $16 per $1,000 in face value.   ``There was profit-taking as expected, but investors were givena shove by the suggestion that monetary policy might be tighteningin Germany and Japan,'' Johnson said.   Further pressuring the markets was a government report thatshowed operating rates at American factories, mines and utilitiesrose to 82.9 percent in May, the highest level in more than eightyears.   The report, well above market expectations, was interpreted as asign that inflation may be lurking.   Analysts fear a crack in investors' confidence, which has beenbuilding gradually, and described the drop as jolting. ``It justpoints out what thin ice we're on,'' Johnson said.   The Dow fell through the psychologically important 2,100-pointlevel, a mark analysts had hoped would serve as a floor for afurther advance.   But lower stock prices also could bring out some bargain hunters.   ``We would use any weakness as a buying opportunity,'' onetrader said.   Among actively traded issues, Texaco was down ] at 49{. The oilcompany, which will face Carl Icahn it its annual shareholdersmeeting Friday, announced a joint venture with a Saudi Arabian oilcompany.   General Electric was off \ at 43\.
