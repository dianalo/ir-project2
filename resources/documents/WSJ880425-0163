John S. Herrington, the U.S. secretary of energy, spent the last week in a half-dozen Asian nations seeking to undermine a possible effort by OPEC and several non-OPEC nations to prop up world oil prices. In his travels, the energy secretary said he deliberately shadowed an OPEC representative who was working to recruit several oil-producing nations for a joint production-cutting effort.    It isn't clear yet what impact, if any, the U.S. move will have on the deliberations beginning here this week between the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ministers and leading non-OPEC, crude-oil producers. Mr. Herrington, interviewed from Bangkok, Thailand, the last stop on his trip before returning to Washington today, insisted that some OPEC leaders are intent on creating nothing less that &quot;a world OPEC.&quot; But Mr. Herrington also asserted that the joint talks, which begin here tomorrow, are &quot;doomed to failure.&quot;    Whether the energy secretary has any success in blocking formation of an alliance, his week of globetrotting shows the high stakes for the U.S. in the outcome of the meetings. Reiterating the Reagan administration's policy of leaving oil and other commodities to &quot;free market&quot; forces, Mr. Herrington said he has been campaigning against the Vienna talks because they would be a destabilizing factor on oil prices. &quot;If they (the oil exporters) are interested in stable oil prices, this is the wrong way to go about it,&quot; he said.    Arturo Hernandez Grisanti, the Venezuelan minister who is leading the push within OPEC toward cooperation with other nations, arrived here early yesterday after a fast-paced, two-week swing through Asian and Mideast oil-producing countries to lobby for his joint production-cutting plan. An OPEC official said that the Venezuelans are confident that this week's meetings will lead to cutbacks totaling between 500,000 and a million barrels a day &quot;for a few months.&quot;    But Mr. Herrington said that in his talks with heads of state and energy ministers in Asia, he found &quot;differences of opinion&quot; and skepticism toward OPEC. &quot;I haven't found one non-OPEC country that is going to the (Vienna) meeting to cut,&quot; he said. &quot;They are going to watch.&quot;    This isn't the first time that Washington has tried to influence OPEC developments. The Reagan administration tried to talk Norway, a major non-OPEC, crude-oil producer, out of cooperating with OPEC a few years ago. During the 1970s, when oil prices were escalating, it was routine for the U.S. Treasury secretary to be dispatched to major OPEC countries, chiefly Saudi Arabia and others in the Mideast, to urge pricing moderation.    But few of Mr. Herrington's predecessors have been as open in their efforts to try to stall or block OPEC developments. Nevertheless, OPEC officials yesterday seemed unperturbed. &quot;This is normal for the U.S.,&quot; said one senior OPEC official. &quot;We don't take it seriously.&quot;    Several OPEC officials are taking seriously the involvement of another American in this week's meetings. He is Kent Hance, who arrives here today to offer Texas' help in firming oil prices. Mr. Hance is a member of the Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates that state's oil production of two million barrels a day. As previously reported, Mr. Hance flew to London in early April to consult with OPEC officials, and will travel to this week's meeting for &quot;private conferences&quot; with ministers.    &quot;We will have eight non-OPEC countries as participants and two and one-half countries -- Norway, the Soviet Union and Texas -- as observers,&quot; said a senior OPEC official.    Mr. Hance's open-mindedness about cooperating with the world's most important cartel has drawn him several critics -- including Mr. Herrington. The energy secretary said the railroad commissioner is &quot;being used by OPEC.&quot;    But in an interview in Houston Friday, Mr. Hance was equally critical of what he called &quot;the lack of any energy policy&quot; in Washington. Mr. Hance said he advocated a joint meeting of OPEC and non-OPEC producers and that Texas, which has been in an economic slump since the 1986 oil-price crash, &quot;ought to get into the huddle.&quot; Noting that the Texas Railroad Commission set world oil prices for four decades until OPEC took over in 1973, he said his No. 1 goal is &quot;stability&quot; of prices.    Mr. Hance isn't clear on precisely how Texas might help OPEC, but he hints that the state might reduce production if others did so. Also, he said Texas' production-monitoring system could be a model for OPEC.    In Canada, Alberta energy officials said they also have accepted an invitation from OPEC to send representatives to Vienna this week. Canadian federal energy officials weren't invited. Alberta, which produces most of Canada's oil, can regulate its output like Texas, and the province has previously expressed sympathy with OPEC. </TEXT></DOC>
