As previously reported, the purchase price is subject to downward adjustment to reflect oil and gas operations since Jan. 1, 1986.    Lear said $50 million of the proceeds has been used to pay Lear Petroleum Partners' bank debt. After paying advances to Lear and closing costs of the transaction, the partnership should have roughly $37 million available, or about $1.40 a Lear Petroleum Partners unit, Lear said.    The partnership is considering several alternatives for the cash, including investing in gas transmission facilities, acquiring oil and gas reserves, investing in other income-producing properties or liquidating the partnership, Lear said.    The sale leaves Lear Petroleum with only its gas transmission operations.    Minatome is a Houston-based subsidiary of Total CFP of France.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Wednesday, Lear Petroleum Corp. closed at $4.75 a share, up 37.5 cents; on the American Stock Exchange, Lear Petroleum Partner units closed at $1.125, down 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
