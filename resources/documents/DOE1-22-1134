The 1985 editionis subdivided into 11 sections, each dealing with a specific type ofreservoir data. Included are maps showing oil and gas pools, productionand disposition areas, well spacing areas, and other related information.Also provided are reservoir data and reserves for all provincial oiland gas pools broken down by unit and non-unit areas. In addition, alisting of oil and gas units and enhanced recovery projects providessuch information as operator, producing zone, number of active wells,and project data such as pattern type, commencement date, and injectionrates. Well spacing, depletion mechanism, capable and active wellcounts,and average well production rates for Saskatchewan oil and gas poolsare specified. Illustrations of typical producing well logs, pool pressuredata, Maximum Permissive Rate factors, gas plant performance plots, andformation water resistivity measurements are given. All reserve, production,pool boundary, and well spacing information contained in this publicationis as of December 31, 1985, unless otherwise noted.</TEXT></DOC>
