JEAN, Que.andP;  -- A bizarre case involving a suspended computerteacher and alleged software piracy has residents buzzing in this communitynorth of Quebec City.andM;Yolande Blackburn-Fortin, an instructor at the local high school, lost herjob last month for refusing to teach classes and &quot;inciting students todisobey&quot; policies set down by the area's school board.andM;The incident began in 1987 when the board, anxious to permit teachers tobegin using the school's Macintosh-equipped computer laboratory, decided tosystematically copy certain commercial software packages, while waiting for ahard disk network to be installed or a multi-copy licence to be obtained.andM;Since the measures were meant to be temporary, the computer teachers agreed.andM;However, a year went by and the situation still hadn't changed.andP;  In fact, awritten &quot;temporary authorization to copy software&quot; was circulated by theschool principal, Claude Gagnon, naming Apple's system software and theprograms &quot;MacPaint&quot;, &quot;MacWrite&quot; and &quot;MacDraw&quot;.andM;The &quot;temporary&quot; measures were extended to the full school year, even thoughFortin had emphasized the illegal nature of the practice in a letteraddressed to the director in August 1988.andP;  In it, she underlined the damagingeffects on the students.andM;According to the letter (translated from its original French) &quot;When ateacher's first gesture is to show students how to copy a diskette, withoutbeing able to inform them that the school has a licence to do so, it's notsurprising to find illegal copies everywhere, or even to see a profitablelittle commerce being carried on by some students.andM;&quot;I trust you fully appreciate the urgency of regularizing this situation, onewhich could have serious consequences for our school board involvingcopyright violation.&quot;andM;At the beginning of the current year, no new measures had been taken.andP;  Thesituation was further confused by the fact that the school board had decidedto equip the school with IBM PCs instead of Macintoshes.andM;There were no funds available to correct the situation in the Macintoshlaboratory, which meant that teachers wishing to continue using it, wouldhave to do so with the existing hardware and software.andM;At that point, Fortin refused to teach her classes and informed her studentsof the reasons why.andM;On Oct. 5, the school suspended her without pay, a decision that wasconfirmed by the school board eight days later.andM;Parent refused accessandM;During the same week, a local radio station reported the dismissal, and wasimmediately cited for libel by the school board's lawyer.andM;After the story broke, a concerned parent decided to visit the laboratoryherself, was refused access by the school principal, and promptly took herchild out of the school.andM;While the chairman of the school board, Denis Gosselin, did order aninvestigation into the issue of piracy, he also made some surprising andrevealing declarations to the local media--some of them making front-pageheadlines.andM;&quot;Even if there was piracy, what company would dare take a school board tocourt and risk having their products boycotted in the school market,&quot; hesaid.andM;He also said that copying could hardly be considered a crime and if it was,&quot;practically every computer owner in town, at one time or another, is acriminal.&quot;andM;Finally, on Oct. 17, the RCMP visited the school and seized the computers, aspart of an &quot;an investigation to determine whether or not piracy is beingpractised in the institution.&quot;andM;School board trustees have refused, however, to take a stand on the piracyissue until an internal investigation has been completed into not only theschool's practices in Jonquiere but also all 42 institutions under theirjurisdiction.andM;The fate of Fortin is not as clear.andP;  At press time, she remained undersuspension and was not teaching.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
