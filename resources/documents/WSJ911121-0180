The 5-4 high court decision imposed federal time limits onsecurities-fraud suits filed by shareholders. Such suitspreviously were subject to state-law time constraints. Thecourt decision also set the limits retroactively, givinglower courts a mandate to dismiss pending lawsuits.</LP><TEXT>   In the past five months, according to a study by the HouseTelecommunications and Finance Subcommittee, suits totaling$652 million have been thrown out as a result of the court'sruling. Motions to dismiss an additional $4.55 billion ofsuits are pending, and motions to dismiss a further $1.21billion of suits are expected, according to the survey.Subcommittee staffers said the survey is incomplete and couldultimately show higher numbers.   Legislators are fuming over the ruling's effect. &quot;In itsill-considered decision, the Supreme Court signed over amultibillion check to Michael Milken, Charles Keating and acoalition of special interests which have produced thefinancial wreckage of the 1980s,&quot; said Rep. Edward Markey(D., Mass.), chairman of the subcommittee.   &quot;I think it would be a monstrous injustice that the iconsof greed in effect escape responsibility by reason of aSupreme Court decision that's given retroactive application,&quot;said Sen. Richard Bryan (D., Nev.), sponsor of a Senate billthat would reinstate the cases. &quot;All that is sought is togive these people a fair day in court.&quot;   The June ruling said suits must be filed within one yearof the time the fraud is discovered and three years of theactual fraud. Senate and House members are scrambling to pushthrough bills that would lengthen the period to two or threeyears after discovery and five years from the actual fraud.   But the bills face significant opposition from largecorporations, accounting firms and the securities industry.The opponents argue that the court's ruling provided neededrelief from uncertainty over possible litigation.   The Bush administration, including Treasury SecretaryNicholas Brady, has agreed to support the pendinglegislation, but only if it includes provisions to block whatthe administration considers frivolous suits. Thatstipulation probably is a deal-breaker, as supporters of thelegislation contend that the frivolous-suit language wouldprevent legitimate actions against some cases of fraud bycompanies and individuals.   The Securities and Exchange Commission and otherregulators are backing the bills. They contend that the newtime limits won't give investors enough time to bring fraudcases, as it often takes the SEC more than three years touncover fraud. The legislation would restore properly filedsuits that have been dismissed, sponsors and plaintiffs'lawyers say.   Among cases that have been dismissed or have dismissalmotions pending, possibly the biggest is one originally filedagainst now-defunct Wall Street house Drexel Burnham LambertInc. and the firm's former junk-bond king Mr. Milken, as wellas Mr. Carr and most major firms on Wall Street. Theplaintiffs bought Executive Life Insurance bonds that lostvalue when the large California insurer, which was headed byMr. Carr, failed. The plaintiffs say they were defraudedbecause they weren't told that their money was going intojunk bonds.   In addition to Messrs. Milken and Carr, defendants filingdismissal motions are securities firms that sold the $1.85billion of Executive Life securities. They include MerrillLynch andamp; Co., Salomon Inc.'s Salomon Brothers, First BostonCorp. and Mr. Brady's former firm, Dillon, Read andamp; Co. Anotherof the defendants, Morgan Stanley Group Inc., is scheduled totestify before Mr. Markey's subcommittee this morning.   Lawyers also have filed for dismissals of suits againstMr. Milken and Thomas Spiegel, the former head of ColumbiaSavings andamp; Loan Association, which has been taken over by theResolution Trust Corp. Because the government is bailing outthe thrift, it would stand to share in any compensation paidin the suits. &quot;The court decision has threatened the recoveryof millions of taxpayer dollars in Sandamp;L and bank failures thatare attributable to securities fraud,&quot; Mr. Markey said.   Another motion is pending in a case involving Mr.Keating's American Continental Corp. Some 23,000 plaintiffscontend they were defrauded of $300 million to $400 millionwhen they bought Lincoln Savings andamp; Loan Association junkbonds in the thrift's branches, thinking they were federallyguaranteed. Those securities collapsed when the thrift becameinsolvent.   Lawyers who back the Supreme Court action shrug off thecriticism as sour grapes from plaintiffs' attorneys seekingbig awards. &quot;The court isn't deciding what the law shall be;that's the legislature's job,&quot; said Theodore Olson, whoargued the high court case on behalf of the law firm that wonit. &quot;I certainly don't have any misgivings about this.&quot;   But that's not the view of Washington lawyer StephenSilbiger. He represented some plaintiffs in a group that losta $130 million judgment when an appeals court reversed thejury award in light of the Supreme Court ruling. The case,which had been tied up in the courts for 18 years, stemmedfrom what Mr. Silbiger calls a &quot;Ponzi scheme&quot; in whichHome-Stake Oil andamp; Gas Co. allegedly bilked investors from 1958to 1973. The award now won't stand because it was filed morethan one year after the discovery of the fraud.   &quot;I think everybody agrees that this is outrageous --except for the people who would have to pay,&quot; he said.</TEXT></DOC>
