Soon gone may be the federal rules that tell utilities and large companies what fuels they can burn in new power-generating facilities. Coal, natural-gas and oil producers could then compete freely for new customers, based on price and availability, rather than being fettered by federal rules.    Before it recessed the Senate moved by unanimous consent to repeal the key provisions of the Power-plant and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978 -- a regulatory nightmare left from the &quot;energy crisis&quot; days when the U.S. was said to be &quot;running out&quot; of indigenous fuel sources. It prohibits the use of natural gas and oil in most new industrial and power-plant boilers, leaving coal as the only major option besides nuclear energy. The House Energy Committee is expected to take up a similar measure after the Easter recess, following unanimous approval by a House subcommittee.    The coal lobby had been blocking repeal of the legislation for years, despite the efforts of the Reagan administration. The coal industry had come to accept that oil and natural gas would be allowed to compete for new electricity-generating contracts. But it insisted that new plants be &quot;coal capable.&quot; That meant hefty investments in equipment and extra land to handle future coal use. &quot;National security,&quot; the coal people argued, was at stake in case of another shortage.    Recently, Sen. J. Bennett Johnston (D., La.), chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, struck a compromise. New power plants need only have &quot;sufficient inherent design characteristics&quot; to permit future coal use. The utilities aren't required to buy any additional land or equipment. The Johnston compromise won the key support of Sens. Wendell Ford (D., Ky.) and James McClure (R., Idaho), as well as the National Coal Association, American Gas Association and Natural Gas Supply Association.    A fight still looms, however, over decontrol of natural-gas prices. The Senate measure includes repeal of the &quot;incremental pricing&quot; requirements of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 -- another legislative offspring of the &quot;energy crisis.&quot; Incremental pricing places a federal surcharge on natural gas for boiler use. The program makes it hard for interstate pipelines to respond competitively to other fuel-price changes. The House energy subcommittee has rejected an amendment to abolish incremental pricing.    It's taken six years since complete oil decontrol for Congress to learn that the federal government doesn't belong in the energy business. We guess that's progress. Members of Congress are recognizing that both consumers and producers benefit from a free market in energy. To achieve this goal, Congress should do away with the remaining controls on natural-gas prices. </TEXT></DOC>
