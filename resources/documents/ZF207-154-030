Arnold, chief of reutilization and marketing at DLA's Technologyand Logistics Services Directorate, said the system will save about $400million over seven years.andP;  The system, called the DRMS Automated InformationSystem (DAISY), will cost about $93 million to develop and maintain, he said.andM;J.J.andP;  Miller, director of the DRMS Office for Policy, Plans and Systems, saidthe system will be installed in five increments, each providing a differentfunction.andP;  If the program stays on schedule, the first three increments willbe deployed simultaneously early next year, he said.andM;The first increment would provide a warehousing system to help DLA keep trackof inventory it receives, stores and issues.andP;  Users would be able to key ininventory data and make it accessible to interested employees throughout theDefense Department.andM;The second increment would help DOD employees obtain equipment no longerneeded by other department personnel.andP;  For example, the system would includea database of spare parts no longer needed by the Air Force.andP;  By accessingthe system, Navy personnel who needed the parts could claim them.andP;  The systemalso would be used to make unclaimed inventory available to other governmentagencies or to non-profit organizations.andM;The third increment would consist of a marketing system to help DRMS sellused and excess DOD equipment to the general public.andP;  The system wouldproduce sales catalogs automatically, help DRMS employees evaluate bids andprovide on-line sales data.andM;Miller said the first three increments will comprise the bulk of DAISY, but asystem to keep tabs on hazardous waste and a management information systemwill be added later.andP;  He said the hazardous waste system would track waste&quot;from cradle to grave,&quot; from the time a contractor picks up the waste to thetime of disposal.andM;The management information system would put in the hands of DRMS managersdata to help them plan, execute and evaluate the waste disposal process.andO;Miller described it as &quot;a management information system that will grow into adecision support system.&quot;andM;Currently, DLA uses a variety of slow, batch-oriented computers to performthese jobs, Miller said.andP;  Some of the systems date, back to the 1960s.andP;  &quot;Wehave a grab bag of individual systems doing parts of the job, and they're notintegrated at all,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;We're long overdue for this integrated system.andO;In some cases, we're still entering here on cards.&quot;andM;Arnold said the faster on-line systemw ill permit DRMS to operate moreefficiently and may reduce the number of employees the service needs to doits job.andM;Miller said DAISY will be the first three-tiered system installed at DLA.andP;  Atthe local level, DRMS will deploy 1,170 Zenith Data Systems Z-248microcomputers at DLA field offices.andP;  The micros will be connected to GouldInc. 9050 or NP1 minicomputers at five regional offices in Ogden, Utah;Memphis, Tenn.; Columbus, Ohio; Wiesbaden, West Germany; and Pearl Harbor,Hawaii.andM;At the highest tier, the machines will connect to one of DLA's existing IBMCorp. mainframes that will be installed at DRMS headquarters in Battle Creek,Mich., Miller said.andM;If all goes according to plan, the system will be up and running at Ogden byMarch of next year, he said.andP;  He said the Memphis system will be deployed byJune.andP;  the Columbus system will be deployed by September and the Europe andPacific ssytems by the end of the year.andP;  He called the deployment schedule&quot;extremely ambitious&quot; and said it might be difficult to achieve.andM;Miller said the DAISY configuration and software will be tested first allHill Air Force Base in Ogden.andP;  If tests proceed as planned, the Ogden systemwill become operable in August, he said.andM;Miller said the unusual practice of using multiple test sites will allow DLAto test the system in a variety of configurations.andP;  Because some DRMS fieldoffices need up to 40 workstations and others need only one, officials wantto test the system in large and small configurations.andM;More than one test site also will allow them to test communictions links andevaluate how minicomputers at Ogden will handle data received from fieldoffices.andP;  &quot;With a tiered system like this, you don't get a good initialoperating capability unless you've got more than one site on line,&quot; Millersaid.andM;Commercial links will be provided by the Defense Data Network at the fiveregional sites, he said.andP;  He added that host bases have so far cooperatedwith DLA.andM;DLA spokesman Larry Wilson said all DAISY hardware will be bought offexisting contracts.andP;  DRMS purchased about $6 million worth of Gould minis offDLA's existing contract with Falcon Systems Inc. for the DistributedMinicomputer System, Wilson said.andM;All software will be developed in-house by DLA's Systems Automation Center inColumbus, he said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
