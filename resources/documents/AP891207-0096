Shamir called a meeting Friday of the four top Cabinet ministersto approve sending Foreign Minister Moshe Arens to the talks,Israel TV reported.   The ``forum of four'' includes Shamir and Arens of theright-wing Likud bloc and well as two left-leaning Labor Partymembers, Finance Minister Shimon Peres and Defense Minister YitzhakRabin.   The moves came as the Israeli army clamped an indefinite curfewon 750,000 Palestinians in the occupied Gaza Strip and was expectedto limit movement by about 1 million people in the West Bank toblock protests linked to Friday's anniversary.   In the West Bank, reinforced army units patrolled Ramallah andBethlehem, and police increased patrols in Arab east Jerusalem. InGaza, soldiers announced through loudspeakers that the seasidestrip was under curfew.   PLO-backed uprising leaders ordered a three-day work stoppagestarting Thursday throughout the occupied lands to mark theanniversary of the ``intefadeh'' _ Arabic for uprising _ inaddition to a general strike Saturday.   Palestinian protests were subdued by rain Thursday, but policedetained three people in a stone-throwing protest near Jerusalem'sOld City, and four protesters were reported shot and wounded in theWest Bank and Gaza.   Israel radio broadcast a police alert urging citizens to watchout for suspicious objects after two small bombs were foundThursday atop bottled gas canisters in a neighborhood of Jerusalem.Both were defused by police.   Police reported that a grenade was thrown at a house in theJewish quarter of the Old City but did not explode.   Also in Gaza, the army demolished three houses in the Khan Yunisrefugee camp overnight, saying the residents were jailed onsuspicion of killing alleged pro-Israeli informers and belonging touprising shock committees.   In Tel Aviv, Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron told a seminaron the uprising that he would like to see ``harsher punishment forparents of stone-throwers ... and much harsher punishment for(suspects) with repeated offenses.''   The army says 40,000 Palestinians have been imprisoned since thestart of the uprising and 9,142 are currently in jail.   At least 626 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli gunfire inthe revolt, and 155 other Palestinians were slain by fellow Arabsas suspected collaborators. Forty-three Israelis also have beenkilled.   Shomron said the army could serve as ``an instrument of thepolitical level'' but could not end the Palestinian rebellion byitself.   ``There is no military solution to the uprising (but)...we canprevent the violence of the uprising from dictating politicalmoves,'' he said.   In Jerusalem, Shamir spokesman Yossi Ahimeir gave the primeminister's response to the proposed meeting in Washington afterU.S. officials announced Egypt had agreed to the meeting.   ``If the Americans believe it is a full response and want to seewhere we go from here, we'll go in January to the meeting of thethree foreign ministers,'' Ahimeir said in an interview.   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III urged the three-waymeeting to pave the way for Israeli-Palestinian talks in Cairo onIsrael's initiative for elections in the West Bank and Gaza.   Ahimeir said that Israel still had not seen the full text ofEgypt's reply and hoped the Washington meeting could answerquestions about Cairo's stance.   ``It will be important to determine what Egypt's intentions are,and the ability to advance the peace initiative as Israel hasproposed, to hold elections,'' he said.   Under Israel's plan, adopted in May, Palestinians would beelected to negotiate with Israel on a period of interim self-rulefor the occupied lands.   The Palestine Liberation Organization has criticized theproposal since it is designed to bypass the PLO and fails toguarantee eventual Palestinian independence, the main aim of theuprising.   Israel views the PLO as a terrorist organization and acceptedthe Baker plan on condition the group would be excluded from thepeace process.   Israeli officials said Shamir and Foreign Minister Moshe Arensworked out a ``positive stand'' to Baker's plan after receivingU.S. assurances that Egypt's reply was its own and not that of thePLO.   ``The U.S. made it clear to Egypt that it could not accept thatEgypt would act as a postman for the PLO, and Egypt made it veryclear that it is not acting as such and would not do so,'' a seniorIsraeli diplomat said.   Shamir's coalition partners in the left-leaning Labor partypraised Egypt's reply, and Vice Premier and Labor leader ShimonPeres declared: ``If it's positive, it's enough.''</TEXT></DOC>
