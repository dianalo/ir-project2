The transfer merely changed the first numberof each Part from ``3'' TO ``7''. Until such time as the Code of FederalRegulations can be found at 15 CFR Parts 368-399 (1988). <ITAG tagnum="28">The Regulations governing the violations at issue are found in the1982, 1983 and 1984 versions of the Code of Federal Regulations.

By so doing, Respondent committed one violation of andSection;787.12 of the Regulations. Based on the Department's motion for default judgment and evidence submittedtherewith, the ALJ correctly found that Respondents committed the one violationof 787.12 of the Regulations as alleged by the Department in its October20, 1988 Charging Letter. I hereby affirm the ALJ's findings of fact andconclusions of law in that regard. Based on his findings, the ALJ recommendedthe denial of all of Respondent's U.S. export privileges for a period often years, which is five years less than the period of time recommendedby the Department. <ITAG tagnum="84">Order </ITAG>(A) For a period of ten years from the date of the final agency action,Respondent_<ITAG tagnum="16">Manfred Schroeder, Lottbeker Weg 176, D 2000, Hamburg 65, FederalRepublic of Germany,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">and all successors, assignees, officers, partners, representatives,agents, and employees hereby are denied all privileges of participating,directly or indirectly, in any manner or capacity, in any transaction involvingcommodities or technical data exported from the United States in wholeor in part, or to be exported, or that are otherwise subject to the Regulations.(B) Participation prohibited in any such transaction, either in the UnitedStates or abroad, shall include, but not be limited to, participation:(i) As a party or as a representative or a party to a validated or generalexport license application; (ii) In preparing or filing any export license application or request forre-export authorization, or any document to be submitted therewith (iii) In obtaining or using any validated or general export license orother export control document; (iv) In carrying on negotiations with respect to, or in receiving, ordering,buying, selling, delivering, storing, using, or disposing of, in wholeor in part, any commodities or technical data exported from the UnitedStates, or to be exported; and (v) In the financing, forwarding, transporting, or other servicing of suchcommodities or technical data.

The letter was issued under the authorityof the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C.A. app.andSection;andSection; 2401-2420) (``the Act''), and of the Export AdministrationRegulations (``the Regulations''), promulgated pursuant to the Act.\1\<NOTE/> The letter charged that Respondent violated andSection; 387.12of the Regulations in 1983 by participating, without the required U.S.authorization, in the reexport of a U.S.-origin computer that benefiteda party denied U.S. export privileges.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The Act was reauthorized and amended by the Export AdministrationAmendments Act of 1985, Pub.

L. 100-418,102 Stat. 1107 (August 23, 1988).<ITAG tagnum="28">The charging letter alleged that Respondent violated the Regulationsduring 1983. From October 15 to December 4, 1983 the Regulations were maintainedin force by Executive Order 12444 (48 FR 48215, October 18, 1983), issuedpursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C.1701-1706.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">The Regulations, formerly codified at 15 CFR Parts 368-399, were redesignatedas 15 CFR Parts 768-799, effective October 1, 1988 (53 Fed. Reg. 37751,September 28, 1988).</ITAG>Respondent failed to answer the charging letter, and the Agency moved onFebruary 17, 1989 for a default judgment. In reply to a February 21, 1989Order to Show Cause why he should not be held in default, Respondent fileda March 2, 1989 letter. Respondent's letter, however, was not in English,and was unaccompanied by a translation into English, and thus failed tocomply with the requirement that all such submissions either be in Englishor be accompanied by an English translation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion</ITAG>The Agency introduced evidence that the charging letter had been servedon Respondent. As to the Agency's substantive case, it focused on Respondent'sparticipation in an October 1983 shipment of a computer from South Africato Sweden. The Agency's evidence showed that this computer was obtainedfrom the United States by a South African company and shipped in January1983 from the United States to South Africa. It was thus a U.S.-origincomputer.This South African company was, according to the Agency's evidence, controlledby a party denied U.S. export privileges. Further according to the Agency'sevidence, in October 1983 the computer was shipped from South Africa toSweden, and the exporter for this shipment was another South African companycontrolled by this party who was denied U.S. export privileges. Consequently,the Agency asserted that the October 1983 shipment constituted a transactionfrom which this denied party obtained benefit and in which he had an interest.As for Respondent's connection with this U.S.-origin computer and its shipmentfrom South Africa to Sweden, the Agency's presentation showed first thatRespondent came to South Africa from the Federal Republic of Germany inJanuary 1983, at about the same time that the computer arrived in SouthAfrica from the United States. Respondent, according to the Agency's evidence,was a computer programmer, employed by the denied party, and assigned toset up the computer in South Africa and to write programs on it. For theOctober 1983 shipment to Sweden, further according to the Agency's evidence,Respondent instructed another employee of the denied party as to how tofill out the export and bank documents, and Respondent himself worked onpacking the computer. On the basis of his instruction regarding the documentsand of his packing activity, the Agency argued that Respondent participatedin the October 1983 shipment.Finally, the Agency's presentation showed further that the party it claimedwas denied U.S. export privileges was in fact a denied party. The Agency'scase demonstrated also that Respondent had never obtained the requiredU.S. authorization to participate in an export of U.S.-origin equipmentwith which the denied party was connected. For a sanction, the Agency proposeda 15 year denial of U.S. export privileges.The nature of the Agency's evidence was mainly reports of interviews ofthree men who were employed by the denied party's companies in South Africain 1983 and who described Respondent's activities as summarized above.The Agency's evidence included also various documents relating to the shipmentof the computer from the United States to South Africa and from there toSweden.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion</ITAG>In the absence of any rebuttal by Respondent, the Agency's presentationis persuasive. It established that the computer at issue was of U.S.-originand that the computer was reexported in October 1983 from South Africato Sweden. The Agency's presentation established additionally that a deniedparty had an interest in and benefited from this reexport, and that Respondent,without the required U.S. authorization, participated in it. Thereforethe evidence of record sustains the allegation of the Agency's chargingletter: that Respondent violated Section 387.12 of the Regulations by participating,without the required U.S. authorization, in a reexport of a U.S.-origincomputer that benefited a denied party.Such a violation is serious, because it undercuts the effectiveness ofthe denial sanction. Nevertheless, on the face of this record, the Agency'sproposal to deny Respondent's U.S. export privileges for 15 years is alittle severe. A denial period of ten years would seem appropriate, andit shall be so ordered. <ITAG tagnum="84">Order </ITAG>I.
