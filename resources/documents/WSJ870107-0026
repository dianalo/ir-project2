The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has agreed to cut production more than 7% this month and plans to return to a fixed price of at least $18 a barrel beginning Feb. 1.    Traders said some buying was spurred when the state-run Kuwait Petroleum Corp. said it canceled crude oil contracts totaling as much as 80,000 barrels a day after two customers rejected Kuwait's fixed price.    The Kuwaiti move &quot;showed their resolve and seemed to give buyers some hope,&quot; said Andrew Lebow, oil analyst for Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., New York.    Crude oil contracts for February delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 27 cents a barrel, to $18.22. The gain, the eighth in the past 11 sessions, resulted in the highest crude oil futures price since Jan. 31, 1986, when it closed at $18.83 a barrel. Heating oil and unleaded gasoline contracts rose about a penny a gallon. February heating oil closed at 50.96 cents a gallon and February unleaded gasoline at 49.78 cents.    Spot, or noncontract, prices were mixed. The spot price of West Texas Intermediate, the domestic barometer of crude oil prices, rose 25 cents, to $18.20 a barrel. But the January price of North Sea Brent, the European bellwether crude, skidded 15 cents, to $18.05. Analysts attributed the Brent price decline to a reaction to Monday's lower U.S. prices.    While many analysts and traders continue to believe that the OPEC agreement won't hold together in the long term, they expect higher prices in the weeks ahead. Some traders expect prices to rise soon to $18.70 or $19 a barrel. &quot;We'll probably get close to $20&quot; within weeks, said Nauman Barakat, oil analyst for Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., New York.    &quot;It's giving all the appearances of a bull market,&quot; Shearson's Mr. Lebow said. &quot;People just want to hold on to crude oil for now,&quot; Merrill Lynch's Mr. Hill said.    In other futures markets yesterday:    STOCK INDEXES: Futures prices rose only slightly as the sizzling rally of the previous two trading days cooled. Despite the slowdown, still higher prices lie ahead for stock-index contracts, said Alan Bush, an analyst with A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons Inc. in Chicago. &quot;You often run into profit-taking on the third day of an up move,&quot; he said. But &quot;nothing of substance&quot; emerged to alter the underlying bullish tone in the market, he added. James Emerson, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago, agreed, but said that &quot;unless we get help from bond futures we might get a day of profit-taking&quot; today. Treasury bond futures closed fractionally lower after also rallying Monday on expectations of lower interest rates.    SUGAR: A British trading house's projection of a current-season surplus, rather than the shortfall expected, sparked selling in world sugar futures. The price of the March 1987 contract fell 0.26 cent to 5.84 cents a pound, just 0.09 cent above the life-of-contract low of 5.75 cents established Oct. 2. Analysts said that E.D. andamp; F. Man Ltd. estimated world sugar output for the season that began Sept. 1 at 100.2 million metric tons, an increase from its previous estimate of 99.7 million tons. The report said April's price rise to 8.98 cents a pound resulted from the Chernobyl nuclear accident and crop difficulties in Cuba and China, and discouraged growers from cutting production. With record yields in European and some African countries as well as depressed consumption, that raises the prospect of a surplus of 500,000 tons, rather than the 600,000-ton shortfall expected, the report said. &quot;The year had started with great optimism that there might be a drawdown in stocks for the second year in a row and that prices would rise. Now, this estimate appears to have shattered those expectations,&quot; said Judy Weissman, analyst for Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., New York.    GRAINS: Weak cash prices, slack export demand and the threat of a trade war with the Common Market pushed corn futures prices to a life-of-contract low as corn for March delivery tumbled 1.5 cents to $1.53 a bushel. Other corn, wheat and soybean futures also slid in moderate trading. Cash corn prices have been depressed by a pickup in available corn, stemming from sales by farmers who waited until the new tax year started and by others who are redeeming &quot;generic&quot; certificates, which represent part of their federal income-support payments, for government-owned corn. Meanwhile, export demand for corn and wheat remains sluggish. In the week ended last Thursday, the U.S. exported only 15 million bushels of corn, 38% less than a year earlier, and exported 46% less wheat. Exports could deteriorate further in a trade war between the U.S. and the Common Market. The U.S. recently announced surcharges as high as 200% on imports of European alcohol, cheese and other food products. The Common Market has threatened to retaliate with surcharges on imports of certain U.S. grains and grain products.    PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices fell despite higher oil prices and a weaker dollar. Brokers said trading was thin and dominated by locals, or those trading for their own account. There was almost no outside participation after midmorning, analysts said. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold contracts for February delivery fell $2.80 an ounce to $402.20; March silver contracts slipped five cents to $5.435 an ounce. Platinum contracts for January delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange edged down $1.20 an ounce to $477.80. Traders and analysts said the booming stock market continues to draw players from the metals rings. &quot;Stocks are too hot for people to be looking at precious metals now,&quot; said Steven Pepper, first vice president and gold trader at Republic National Bank of New York. &quot;When the stock market cools down or gets hit with a correction, then some money will find its way into metals,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
