The Commission receivedno comments on the proposal. This order approves the proposal.Rule G-19(b) provides that, before making a recommendation to a customer,a securities professional must determine that the securities are a suitableinvestment for that customer. The rule specifies that a suitability determinationshall be based upon, among other things, information furnished by the customerrelating to its ``financial background, tax status and investment objectivesand any other similar information.'' In 1987, the Board adopted and theSEC approved an amendment to rule G-8(a)(xi) to require the recordkeepingof suitability information for customer accounts required to be obtainedby rule G-19.The MSRB stated, however, that because of a cross-referencing problem inthe rule, rule G-8(a) did not require dealers to keep suitability recordsfor institutional accounts, yet dealers are required to comply with ruleG-19 when making recommendations to institutional customers. Therefore,the Board proposed the amendment to rule G-8(a)(xi) to require the recordkeepingof suitability information for institutional accounts.The Commission agrees with the Board that the amendment would provide additionalprotection by facilitating a dealer's discharge of its suitability responsibilitiesand would assist municipal securities principals and regulatory examinersin reviewing transactions for compliance with rule G-19. Thus, the Commissionfinds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirementsof the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to the MSRB.In particular, the Commission believes that the proposal is consistentwith section 15B(b)(2)(C), which requires MSRB rules to, among other things,be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices,to promote just and equitable principles of trade and, in general, to protectinvestors and the public interest.<T3>It is therefore ordered,</T3> Pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,that File No. SR-MSRB-88-4, be, and hereby is, approved.<ITAG tagnum="21">For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuantto delegated authority, 17 CFR 200.30-3 (12).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan G.
