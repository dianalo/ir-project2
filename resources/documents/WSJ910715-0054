He raises severalquestions, all of which have obvious answers:   1) &quot;How do we know new reactors will be safer andcheaper?&quot; Three decades of successful operating experiencewith lightwater reactors without harm to any member of thepublic is a good base on which to build. Advancedcomputerized controls, simplified and improved safetysystems, and new training simulators offer improved safetyand better economics.</LP><TEXT>   No net safety improvement of any significance can bedocumented that resulted from intervention by an activistgroup, as Mr. Grinspoon claims. The huge costs resulting fromcapricious interventions and unexpected delays will not berepeated. Without licensing reforms, the nation's utilitieswill continue to hold off on ordering new nuclear-powerplants.   2) Mr. Grinspoon asks why it's necessary to &quot;streamline&quot;the licensing process so as to exclude the public. Thereforms do not exclude the public in any way. They simplyrequire that all public hearings be held before constructionbegins, and that once an issue is resolved, it cannot bebrought up over and over again.   3)&quot;What will we do with the high level waste anddecommissioned reactors?&quot; That is the wrong question. Whathas waste disposal to do with licensing reform? The wastesalready exist and must be disposed of, regardless of whethernew plants are ordered. Activists don't like to hear it, butthere is scientific consensus that underground waste disposalis feasible, safe and permanent.   Mr. Grinspoon mentions advances in solar-energytechnology, but we must be realistic about this source. Forone thing, it must be heavily subsidized to compete. Andthough utilities welcome any solar energy that would reducetheir own daytime peak-load periods, the fact remains thatwith hard work and innovation, we could produce only 1% to 2%of our electricity by solar and wind power by the year 2000.   A. David Rossin   Los Altos Hills, Calif.                                                                                                          (Mr. Rossin, assistant secretary for nuclear energy,Department of Energy, 1986-87, is an energy consultant toultilities and universities. He is president-elect of theAmerican Nuclear Society, though his views here are his ownand haven't been reviewed by the society.)   ---   The greatest failure of energy producers is nottechnological but sociological and political. Industry'spreoccupation with technical advances has blinded it to theneed to take seriously the demagoguery of opponents oftechnology and growth.   While Mr. Grinspoon creates the illusion of questioningspecifics, an honest review of the record clearly indicatesthe Greens oppose technology in principle and will neveraccept technical progress or economic growth as beneficial.The performance of nuclear power cited in Mr. Grinspoon'sletter was hindered at every step by the very people who nowcite inefficiency as the problem.   Bob Currie   Kennard, Texas   ---   Nuclear power plants are not abysmal failures: More than70% of France's electricity is produced by 50 nuclear-powerplants. As a result, France has a relatively cleanerenvironment. And it handles waste disposal by vitrifying andburying the resulting ceramic in deep caves, a system that isacceptable to anybody willing to examine the systemdispassionately.   Unfortunately, in our country, a combination of badpublic-utility planning, misinformation over the dangers ofwell-designed nuclear systems, and modern Luddite hysteriahas so politicized our regulatory system that we have missedthe possibility of developing an efficient energy-generatingsystem that avoids contaminating the atmosphere with thewasteful combustion products of non-renewable fossil fuels.   David W. Woodward   Kennett Square, Pa.   ---   About 40% of the cost of many nuclear plants has been thecost of financing and escalation during the excruciatinglylong process of licensing, building and re-licensing; thecostly and non-productive result of intervention, politicalopportunism and the regulatory morass. Reducing the cost byreturning to the reasonable schedules we used to meet, andwhich competing industrial nations continue to meet, not onlyreduces cost to consumers and assures satisfaction of ourever-growing electricity demand, but improves our ability todisplace fossil fuels and thus address global warming andother environmental effects.   Greenpeace trots out the nuclear waste bugaboo, but ofcourse it is an intractable political problem rather than adaunting technical one. Does the nation benefit frompropaganda that fuels the political problem, or would webenefit from honest and constructive efforts to resolve it?   Greenpeace says that nuclear energy supplies only 8% ofthe nation's energy. But that is 20% of our electricalenergy. Only coal supplies more of our electricity.Renewables (except for the hydro-electric plants developeddecades ago) supply a fraction of 1%, and aren't likely tobecome a major source of electricity. The peaceful atom nowsupplies about the same amount of the world's electricity aswas supplied from all sources 30 years ago.   R.M. Campbell   Retired Consulting Engineer   Cohasset, Mass.   ---   If there's one thing Greenpeace hates, it's a logicaldiscussion about nuclear energy. I suggest Mr. Grinspoonvisit the Piedmont region of North and South Carolina, wherenuclear power provides more than 60% of the electricity usedin homes, schools and business. It is safe, clean andinexpensive energy.   Contrary to what Mr. Grinspoon would have you believe,solutions exist to dispose of high-level waste. I find hisargument about nuclear waste particularly hypocritical, sinceextremist groups such as Greenpeace have labored to block anyrational discussion or solution to nuclear-waste disposal.Strip away Greenpeace's veneer of environmentalism and you'llfind technology haters willing to force the rest of us to sitin the dark to satisfy their crackpot fantasies of greenutopia.
