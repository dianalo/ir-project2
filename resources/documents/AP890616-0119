The criticism came as Soviet and U.S. officials held a second dayof talks on ways of advancing peace talks between Israel, the 1.7million Palestinians under its control and Israel's Arab neighbors.   The talks at the State Department are a continuation of theperiodic consultations between the superpowers begun by the previousU.S. administration to foster cooperation in various parts of theworld.   But U.S. officials say this time the discussions on the MiddleEast could result in a role for the Soviet Union in the so-calledArab-Israeli peace process, which has so far been orchestratedmostly by the United States.   ``The Soviets have been making some positive comments in recentmonths that could give them a concrete role,'' said one official,who asked not to be named.   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler declined todiscuss specifics of the talks, saying only they had been``constructive.''   The United States wants the Soviets to use their influence withthe hardline Arab states like Syria and Iraq, as well as thePalestine Liberation Organization, to push forward Arab-Israelipeace talks. But it continues to insist the Soviets can only becomeactive partners in the dialogue if they renew the diplomatic tiesthey broke with Israel in 1967.   Tutwiler said Israel's decision to shut the offices of SariNusseibeh, an Islamic philosophy professor and journalist with closeties to PLO leader Yasser Arafat, was counterproductive to itsrecent proposal for elections of Palestinian negotiators in theoccupied territories.   ``We are disturbed by actions such as this,''' she said. ``At atime when Israel has put forth a positive and constructiveinitiative aimed at reaching out to Palestinians, it's hard to seehow this step can be helpful.''   If, as Israel contends, Nusseibeh has engaged in ``illegalactivities, he should be afforded an appropriate, open judicialproceeding,'' Tutwiler added.   The Nusseibeh case, which has attracted wide attention because ofhis ties with Western journalists, is likely to come up in talksFriday between State Department officials and Israeli JusticeMinister Dan Meridor.</TEXT></DOC>
