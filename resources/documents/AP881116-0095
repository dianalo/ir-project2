The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said capital _ representing thedifference between loans and other assets and deposits and otherliabilities _ increased $2.4 billion in September following a $6.1billion increase in August. In the first seven months of the year,the industry lost $6.1 billion in capital.   Capital declines are often a good indicator of losses, but thebank board began increasing the pace of Sandamp;L rescues in mid-August.Rescues, in effect, wipe out the red ink of the failed institutions,transferring it to the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.,which insures deposits up to $100,000.   The industry lost $7.5 billion in the first six months of thisyear, and bank board economist James Barth has estimated thirdquarter losses at about $2 billion.   ``Not suprisingly, the use of financial assistance to protectinsured depositors exerts a positive effect on the overall financialcondition of the thrift industry,'' Barth said in a statement.   The agency has dealt with more than 140 troubled institutions sofar this year.   Meanwhile, deposits flowed out of the nation's 3,028 Sandamp;Ls for thefifth consecutive month. The drain followed seven months of gains asinvestors sought a safe haven for their money after the October 1987stock market crash.   Net withdrawals totaled $1.8 billion in September, down from $3.0billion in August. For the first nine months of the year, Sandamp;Ls hadnet new deposits of $6.7 billion, compared with net withdrawals of$13.7 billion during the same period of 1987.   Thrift institutions' mortgage lending business continued tosuffer with the decline in housing sales and construction. Mortgageloans closed totaled $23.2 billion, down 5.6 percent from August anddown 12.6 percent from a year ago.   For the first nine months of 1988, mortgage lending was off by7.4 percent from the same period a year ago.</TEXT></DOC>
