The West German auto maker said net income climbed to 199 million marks ($104.9 million) from 174 million marks a year earlier. BMW earlier reported a 19% increase in first-half parent-company sales, to 10.96 billion marks ($5.78 billion) from 9.22 billion marks.    BMW attributed the gains mostly to the success of its up-market 7 series and its mid-range 5 models. These two models made up nearly half of the 272,217 cars produced in the first half. Overall car production was up 20% from 227,786 units a year earlier.    Global registrations of BMW cars advanced 16% in the first half, to 285,000, with notable sales gains in West Germany, other West European countries and East Asia. In the U.S., BMW deliveries matched the year-earlier level, the company said. </TEXT></DOC>
