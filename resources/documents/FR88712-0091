On February2, 1988, OMB approved all of the requirements except for those containedin paragraphs (m)(1)(i) through (m)(4)(ii) under OMB clearance number 1218-0145.OSHA is submitting the following clearance package to OMB in a requestfor reconsideration of OMB's decision to deny information collection approvalfor paragraphs m(1)(i) through m(4)(ii) which pertain to labeling and preparationof Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs) under the Formaldehyde Standard.Because similar requirements already exist under OSHA's generic standard,Hazard Communication (29 CFR 1910.1200), OSHA estimates that there areno additional burdens attributable to these provisions and that no furtherrecordkeeping burden would be incurred.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M002</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration(s) 3 336-337</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-C</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="85">Supporting Statement for Information Collection Requirements of theFormaldehyde Standard Concerning the Hazard Communication Provisions_Justification</ITAG>1. Circumstances Requiring the Collection of Information The Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 651 etseq.) authorizes the promulgation of such health and safety standards thatwill reduce significant risk of material impairment of health. The statutespecifically authorizes information collection by employers as ``necessaryor appropriate for the enforcement of the OSH Act or for developing informationregarding the causes and prevention of occupational accidents and illnesses.''Moreover, in regard to areas in wihch employees are exposed to toxic substancesor harmful physical agents. The OSH Act provides that the Secretary ofLabor shall issue regulations requiring employers to keep records of employeeexposures (29 U.S.C. 657(c)). The Occupational Safety and Health Administration's primary responsibilityis to assure employees safe and healthful places of employment. As onemeans of achieving this objective, the OSH Act authorizes the promulgationof mandatory safety and health standards that provide control measuresfor particular hazards. For toxic substances and harmful physical agents,the OSH Act contains an explicit mandate that the standard promulgatedbe expressed in terms of objective criteria and of the performance desiredwhenever practicable (29 U.S.C. 655(b)(5)). Health standards must includeprovisions for monitoring and measuring employee exposure, suitable protectiveequipment and control of technological procedures, and type and frequencyof medical examinations or other tests, as appropriate. The statute alsomandates the inclusion of appropriate warning labels (29 U.S.C. 655(b)(7)).According to section 6(b)(7) of the OSH Act:<ITAG tagnum="21">Any standard promulgated under this subsection shall prescribe theuse of labels or other appropriate forms of warning as are necessary toinsure that employees are apprised of all hazards to which they are exposed,relevant symptoms and appropriate emergency treatment, and proper conditionsand precautions of safe use or exposure.</ITAG>The Act and its legislative history recognize that recordkeeping and reportingby employers are necessary both for enforcement of the Act and for developinginformation regarding the causes and prevention of occupational accidentsand illnesses (29 U.S.C. 651(b)(12); 657(c)(1)). In addition, the Act specificallystates that:<ITAG tagnum="21">The Secretary *** shall also issue regulations requiring that employers,through posting of notices or other appropriate means, keep their employeesinformed of their protections and obligations under this Act, includingthe provisions of applicable standards. (29 U.S.C. 657(c)(1)).</ITAG>The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) recently adopteda health standard governing employee exposure to formaldehyde (29 CFR 1910.1048).Pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act, OSHA also submitted a requestfor approval of information collection requirements to the Office of Managementand Budget (OMB). Information collection requirements for this standardwere approved by OMB under Control Number 1218-0145 on February 2, 1988,except for paragraphs (m)(1)(i) through (m)(4)(ii). These disapproved paragraphsprovide objective criteria for determining when the presence of formaldehydeconstitutes a health hazard. They also prescribe the information that mustbe included on labels to be placed on containers of formaldehyde, certainformaldehyde-treated products and products containing formaldehyde, andinformation to be included in the accompanying Material Safety Data Sheets(MSDSs). In its letter of February 2, 1988, OMB disapproved any requirements forlabels and MSDSs in the Formadehyde Standard (FS) that went beyond thosealready approved in the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard (HCS). OMB believedthat their record did not contain sufficient information at that time tomake a determination that the information collection requirements at issuewere consistent with the Paperwork Reduction Act. OSHA is resubmitting a request for information collection approval forthese disapproved provisions with a more detailed justification. A copyof 29 CFR 1910.1048 (m)(1)(i) through (m)(4)(ii) is attached to this documentas Appendix I. OSHA requests expedited consideration of this request. The new standard requires employers to monitor formaldehyde exposure andemployee health under certain conditions, to reduce formaldehyde exposurebelow the revised permissible exposure limits (PELs), and to train employeesto recognize formaldehyde's health effects and how to deal with workplaceformaldehyde hazards. The hazard communication provisions are inextricablyintertwined with the other provisions of the Formaldehyde Standard to eliminatesignificant cancer risk. The information collection and disclosure activitiesfor the hazard communication provision of this standard is listed below.Under the hazard communication provision of the Formadehyde Standard (andSection;1910.1048(m)(1)(i) through (m)(4)(ii)), formaldehyde gas, all mixtures or solutionscomposed of greater than 0.1 percent formaldehyde, and materials capableof releasing formaldehyde into the air under normal conditions of use atconcentrations reaching or exceeding 0.1 ppm must be considered a healthhazard. At a minimum, specific health hazards that the employer shall addressare: cancer, irritation and sensitization of the skin and respiratory system,eye and throat irritation, and acute toxicity. The employer must assure that hazard warning labels complying with therequirements of 29 CFR 1910.1200(f) are affixed to all containers wherethe presence of formaldehyde constitutes a ``health hazard'' as defined.At a minimum, labels must identify the hazardous chemical; list the nameand address of the responsible party; contain the information ``PotentialCancer Hazard''; and appropriately warn of all other hazards as definedin 29 CFR 1910.1200, Appendices A and B.In addition, the Formaldehyde Standard states: ``any employer who usesformaldehyde-containing materials that constitute a health hazard as definedin this standard shall comply with the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.1200(g)with regard to the development and updating of Material Safety Data Sheets.''See 29 CFR 1910.1048(m)(4)(i).Manufacturers, importers, and distributors of formaldehyde-containing materialsthat constitute a health hazard as defined in this standard must assurethat Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDSs) and updated information are providedto all employers purchasing such materials at the time of initial shipmentand at the time of the first shipment after a Material Safety Data Sheetis updated.2. Use of Information and Consequence to Federal ProgramThe information collected pursuant to with this standard is used to ensurethat information concerning the health hazards of formaldehyde is conveyedto affected employers and employees. Compliance with this aspect of thestandard is required in order to maintain a safe and healthful work environment.Failure to transmit this information will significantly impair OSHA effortsto protect the health of employees exposed to formaldehyde in the workplace.3. Use of Improved Information TechnologyOSHA did not mandate detailed procedures for satisfying the hazard communicationprovisions of the Formaldehyde Standard. OSHA included performance-orientedexemptions which permit employers to use a wide array of techniques todemonstrate that their employees are exposed to formaldehyde only at concentrationsbelow those triggering the hazard communication requirements. OSHA didnot mandate specific forms for the MSDSs nor specifications for the label,but required only the minimal information necessary to convey the hazard.The information collection requirements of these provisions are intendedto ensure that information concerning the health hazards of formaldehydeis transmitted to affected employers and employees. Thus this regulationminimizes burdens on industry to the extent practical and consistent withthe purposes of the Act.4. Efforts to Identify DuplicationThese provisions are complementary to the Hazard Communication Standard,29 CFR 1910.1200, which has the explicitly stated purpose to eliminateduplication of efforts through preemption of state law. No other federalagency requires the reporting or collection of information regarding formaldehydein the workplace.5. Use of Similar InformationThe information required by this standard is specific to, and availableonly from manufacturers, distributors, importers, and employers. Product-specificdata are not available elsewhere in the Federal Government, nor are publishedreports of a similar nature available in the Federal Government. Further,the public record of this rulemaking does not indicate any alternate sourcefor this information.6. Consideration of Small BusinessesThe burden of these requirements is an equal obligation for all employerswith employees exposed to formaldehyde in the workplace. Because of themanner in which the standard is written, employers can choose to respondto these information collection requirements in the way that is best suitedto their work environments. The requirements are based on performance,and compliance is judged accordingly. There are no set requirements forthe format or manner in which the information collected is to be documentedor maintained. In addition, these provisioins minimize burdens to employersproducing formaldehyde or formaldehyde containing products because thehazard determination required by the Hazard Communication Standard, 29CFR 1910.1200(d), has been made by OSHA in the Formaldehyde Standard.7. Consequence of Less Frequent Information CollectionThe information collection frequencies specified in these provisions arethe minimum amount necessary to assure that employees are adequately informedof the hazards associated with formaldehyde.8. Special CircumstancesThere are no special circumstances applicable to paragraphs (m)(1)(i) through(m)(4)(ii) of the Formaldehyde Standard.9. Consultation Outside the AgencyConsultation with persons and organizations outside of OSHA concerningthe Formaldehyde Standard, including paragraphs (m)(1)(i) through (m)(4)(ii),has been extensive (as outlined below):A. On January 11, 1985, OSHA announced that public meetings would be heldin Washington, DC on February 13-15, 1985 (50 FR 1547), to generate informationwhich would help OSHA to decide whether or not permanent rulemaking shouldbe initiated under section 6(b) of the Act. New information on formaldehyde'shealth effects and quantitative risk assessments for formaldehyde was introducedat the meetings and in post-hearing comments [Docket Numbers H-225 andH-225A, Exhibits 68-1 to 68-23; 69-1A to 69-34; 70-1 to 70-58, and 76-1to 76-8].B. On April 15, 1985, OSHA announced that it would proceed with permanentrulemaking to reduce formaldehyde exposure, basing its decision on thedetermination that the existing standard did not adequately address theadverse health effects associated with occupational exposure to formaldehyde.OSHA published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) (50 FR 15179,April 17, 1985). Forty-three submissions, many of them containing commentsrelating to hazard communication, were received in response to the ANPR[Exhibits 77-1 to 77-43].C. Based on a review of the existing record, new references identifiedby OSHA [Exhibits 73-1 to 73-189], and Health Hazard Evaluations providedby NIOSH [Exhibits 78-1 to 78-91], OSHA completed a Preliminary RegulatoryImpact Analysis [Exhibit 81] and published a proposed rule (50 FR 50412to 50499) on December 10, 1985. An informal hearing which provided thepublic with an opportunity to comment was held from May 5 to 16, 1986 inWashington, DC. The public was afforded further opportunity to commenton the proposal during the post hearing comment period and later, duringa limited one-month re-opening of the record beginning on December 12,1986 (51 FR 44796). Many of the comments received addressed labels, MSDSsand other aspects of hazard communication in relation to formaldehyde,particularly the need for a cut-off or a level below which the requirementswould not apply. More than 1400 exhibits containing approximately 30,000pages of testimony and comments were received into the record of this rulemaking.D. On December 2, 1987 OSHA received an Application for an AdministrativeStay for the hazard communication provisions of the Formaldehyde Standardfrom several parties, including the Formaldehyde Institute, the AmericanTextile Manufacturers Institute and the National Particleboard Association[Exhibits 251-4, 251-8]. Subsequently, OSHA received over 90 letters apparentlyresulting from an organized campaign that supported the petition [Exhibits252-1 to 252-91].E. On February 2, 1988, OMB disapproved the collection of information requirementsof the Formaldehyde Standard regarding any hazard communication requirementsthat go beyond those already approved in the Hazard Communication Standardand conditionally approved other collection of information requirementsof the Formaldehyde Standard.OSHA has based its final standard on occupational exposure to formaldehydeon all of the evidence accumulated until the close of the record in January1987. The above referenced Exhibits and others are available in the publicrecord, Docket H-225, 225A, 225B, and 225C, which is available for inspectionin the OSHA Docket Office, Room N-3670, U.S. Department of Labor Building,200 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20210. For this paperwork approvalsubmission, OSHA has also reviewed and evaluated the recent informationprovided by the petitioners and by OMB in its letter of February 2, 1988.10. Assurance of ConfidentialityThere are no issues regarding confidentiality for these provisions of thestandard.11. Questions of a Sensitive NatureThis question is not applicable as questions of this nature are not askedof the respondents as a requirement of this standard.12. Estimate of Annual Costs<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Cost to the Federal Government</ITAG>Paragraphs (m)(1)(i) through (m)(4)(ii) pertain to hazard communicationprograms implemented by employers subject to the standard and do not requireexpenditures by the Federal Government. Therefore, OSHA estimates thatthe annual cost to the Federal Government over the period to be coveredby this paperwork clearance request is $0.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Method Used to Estimate Cost of Burden to Respondents</ITAG>The source for the data used to estimate the paperwork burden for the informationcollection requirements contained in paragraphs (m)(1)(i) through (m)(4)(ii)is OSHA's Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA). OSHA estimated that 112,217facilities will be required to comply with the requirements of the FormaldehydeStandard. Based upon an analysis of the record, OSHA has determined thatthere will be three classes of industries affected by the revised standard(Tables A and B).Tier 1, which covers 35,998 establishments employing 412,168 workers, consistsof the industries where some firms have workers who are currently exposedabove either the 1 ppm TWA or 2 ppm STEL. This group consists of foundries,laboratories, funeral homes, and industry sectors engaged in the manufactureof the following five products: 1) hardwood plywood; 2) particleboard;3) fiberboard; 4) furniture; and, 5) formaldehyde resins.Tier 2, which covers 28,682 establishments employing 1,074,604 workerswho are currently exposed between the 0.5 ppm action level and the 1 ppmTWA and where no firms have employees exposed above either the 1 ppm TWAor 2 ppm STEL. This group is comprised of textile finishing and industrysectors engaged in the manufacture of the following three products: 1)apparel; 2) formaldehyde; and, 3) molded plastcs.Tier 3 consists of 24 sectors (Table A) where some firms have workers whoare currently exposed above 0.1 ppm and where no firms have employees exposedabove the 0.5 ppm action level. This group covers 47,537 establishmentsemploying 796,292 workers.

Summary of Estimated Annual Cost of Information Collection</ITAG>a. <T3>Introduction. </T3>OSHA estimated that the burdens of complying withthe hazard communication provisions of the Formaldehyde Standard (FS) weresubsumed by the Hazard Communication Standard (HCS). OSHA therefore concludedthat no paperwork burden would result from imposition of paragraphs (m)(l)(i)through (m)(4)(ii) of the Formaldehyde Standard. OSHA believes, however,that these provisions enhance the effectiveness of both the FormaldehydeStandard and the Hazard Communication Standard. For example, the preamblestates:<ITAG tagnum="21">OSHA believes that the record evidence provides ample testimony ofthe difficulties in precisely determining the circumstances under whichthe generic standard would apply for substances that do not exactly fitthe definition of an article yet also do not have very much exposure potential.Without the benefit of a complete standard, which requires employers todetermine their employee's exposures. OSHA could define such trivial amounts[in the HCS] only within the context of a percent composition. For resinswhich decompose to release formaldehyde, this approach is meaningless.However, a workable approach can be derived within the context of thissubstance-specific standard and this is the approach that OSHA has takenin the final rule. In addition, as noted above, the final rule's paragraph(m) requirements are entirely consistent with the Agency's generic HazardCommunication standard. </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">(52 FR at 46283). OSHA has concluded that the Formaldehyde Standardimproves the Hazard Communication Standard's effectiveness and efficiency,and that these findings are supported by the formaldehyde rulemaking record.On February 2, 1988, OMB disapproved paragraphs (m)(1)(i) through (m)(4)(ii)of the Formaldehyde Standard, explaining that it did not have sufficientinformation about the relative burdens imposed on industry by the FormaldehydeStandard and the Hazard Communication Standard, and that OSHA had not givenit sufficient time to perform an adequate assessment of the paperwork burdensimposed by those sections. OSHA therefore submits this revised paperworkjustification to provide that information.OSHA continues to believe that the Formaldehyde Standard's hazard communicationrequirements to not impose paperwork burdens beyond those imposed by theHazard Communication Standard. In fact, in some situations the FormaldehydeStandard's hazard communication requirements may actually decrease theexisting burden. The rulemaking record for formaldehyde indicated thatemployers and employees would both benefit from explicit guidance regardingthe application of the generic HCS requirements to this particular substance.This is especially appropriate due to the ubiquitous nature of formaldehydeusage and the physical characteristics of the chemical.b. <T3>Relationship of the hazard communication provision of the FormaldehydeStandard to the Hazard Communication Standard </T3>Because the provisions of the Formaldehyde Standard are specifically tailoredto the properties and uses of formaldehyde, they provide a level of guidanceand enforcement certainty which would not be available to formaldehydemanufacturers under the Hazard Communication Standard. However, these provisionsserve the same function as those of the Hazard Communication Standard andare intended to result in the same information being provided to employees.Therefore, OSHA believes that the paperwork burden imposed by the hazardcommunication portion of the Formaldehyde Standard is virtually identicalto, and in any event no greater than, that imposed by the Hazard CommunicationStandard. <T3>i. The Requirements of the Hazard Communication Standard. </T3>TheHazard Communication Standard is a generic standard broadly scoped to ensurethat the toxic effects of all chemicals are evaluated, and that informationconcerning health and safety hazards is transmitted to affected employersand employees. The standard defines a chemical as posing a ``health hazards''if it can cause an acute or chronic health effect. Health hazards include,inter alia, carcinogens, irritants, and sensitizers. The determinationof whether a chemical constitutes a health hazard is based on the intrinsiccharacteristics of the chemical, and not upon any form of risk assessmentwhich takes into account the level of exposure which may be expected. Formaldehydeis a health hazard under this definition because substantial evidence existsthat it is a carcinogen, an irritant, and a sensitizer. Because many chemicals that constitute health hazards are ultimately incorporatedinto materials or products in such a manner that individuals working withor using them will not be exposed to the chemical itself, the HCS doesnot apply to ``articles.'' An article is defined in the HCS as ``a manufactureditem (i) which is formed to a specific shape or design during manufacture;(ii) which has end use function(s) dependent in whole or in part upon itsshape or design during end use; and (iii) which does not release, or otherwiseresult in exposure to, a hazardous chemical under normal conditions ofuse.'' \1\<NOTE/> Because of formaldehyde's unusual characteristic of ``offgassing''from solids and resins used in apparel and wood products, many formaldehyde-containingproducts would not be considered ``articles'' for purposes of the HCS.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ OSHA explained that materials which release only verysmall quantities of a hazardous chemical may still be considered ``articles''under this definition. 52 FR 31865 (1987). The definition itself is thesubject of a new rulemaking proceeding in accord with a separate OMB decisionunder the Paperwork Reduction Act. However, pending completion of thatrulemaking, OMB has approved OSHA's current application of the articlesexemption. ii. The Requirements of the Formaldehyde Standard During the Formaldehyde Standard rulemaking, a number of comments requestedthat products that release small amounts of formaldehyde be granted a deminimis exemption from the labeling requirements of the standard. In fact,this issue received more comment than any other provision in the proposedstandard. OSHA agreed with these commenters that a de minimis exceptionwas appropriate, and in the final rule, OSHA included a low-level cutoffbelow which the labeling provisions of the FS do not apply. Labeling ofcontainers is required only for materials capable of releasing formaldehydeinto the air at concentrations reaching or exeeding 0.1 ppm under normalconditions of use, or when mixtures or solutions contain more than 0.1percent formaldehyde.\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ OMB stated in its Febuary 2 letter that the ``F.S. alsointroduces uncertainty about whether for purposes of Hazard Communication,a solid object is a `container,' a `mixture,' neither or both.'' OSHA believesthat the obligation to label containers, and not products, is clearly statedin the preamble. However, in light of OMB's letter, OSHA intends to publisha clarification that all statements pertaining to the placement of hazardwarning labels which are made in the preamble apply to containers. It iscontainers, not the solid products, which must bear a warning label.The 0.1 percent composition requirement is analogous to the treatment ofother carcinogens in the HCS. However, the 0.1 ppm aspect of the de minimisexemption in the Formaldehyde Standard is a departure from the HCS, whichdoes not base labeling requirements on exposure levels. The different approachin the FS was chosen because formaldehyde is unusual in its ability to``offgas'' from finished products, its widespread presence in a broad rangeof materials, its background presence in air, and the difficulty of measuringconcentrations below 0.1 ppm. OSHA determined that, in light of these factors,a de minimis labeling exemption based on exposure levels is appropriate,and serves some of the same functions as the articles exemption servesfor the generic HCS.<T3>iii. The relative paperwork burdens under the Formaldehyde Standardand the Hazard Communication Standard. </T3>Because of the de minimis exemptionto the labeling requirements in the FS, the paperwork burden imposed bythe FS is no greater, and may even be lesser, than that imposed on manufacturersof formaldehyde-containing materials by the HCS. With the exception ofthe de minimis exemption, the scope and application of the hazard communicationprovisions of the FS are identical to those of the HCS. Thus, because ofthe de minimis provision, the FS actually requires that labels be providedon far fewer materials than is required under the HCS. It is for this reasonthat OSHA has explained that no additional burden hours are imposed bythe FS.The arguments of some industry groups that the FS imposes additional paperworkburdens on manufacturers of formaldehyde-containing products are basedon a plainly erroneous reading of the HCS. According to these groups, therequirement in the HCS that ``appropriate'' labels be provided allows theemployer discretion to determine when the risk level justifies a labeland additionally to choose which health hazards the label will address.To the contrary, as we have explained, the HCS requires labels whenevera hazardous chemical is present in the workplace in such a manner thatemployers may be exposed to it at any level under normal conditions ofuse or in a foreseeable emergency. The plain language of the HCS, the preamblediscussion of the relevant provisions, and OSHA's enforcement instructionsand other post-promulgation statements are consistent. All make clear thatrisk assessment whereby a manufacturer makes an assessment of the magnitudeof risk or the likelihood of disease as a criterion for deciding whetherto provide an MSDS or a label is not permissible under the standard. Thereis simply no merit whatsoever to the industry argument that the unilateralopinion of manufacturers that a 0.1 ppm concentration of formaldehyde doesnot pose a risk excuses them from labeling. In fact, for almost two years,OSHA has had in effect a field memorandum interpreting the HCS as requiringa cancer warning on containers of formaldehyde and formaldehyde products.(See memo to the field, Appendix II).Similarly, OMB stated in its February 2 letter that comments to that Agency'srecord, primarily from manufacturers of wood products, show that many woodproducts which OSHA has said are now covered under the HCS are not, infact, currently being labeled in accordance with what the FormaldehydeStandard requires because employers believe that the HCS does not requiresuch labels. There are no reasonable grounds for this belief and OMB wronglyuses that as a factor in denying paperwork clearance. In the preamble tothe formaldehyde proposal as well as in the final rule, the Agency setforth a detailed clarification of the Hazard Communication Standard's labelingrequirements for wood and wood products (See 50 FR at 50484; 52 FR at 46284).Those documents explained that the Hazard Communication Standard's exemptionfor wood and wood products does not apply when wood and wood products aretreated with a chemical, such as formaldehyde, that is itself not excludedfrom coverage under the Hazard Communication Standard. In light of thisclear coverage, any alleged noncompliance with the existing labeling provisionsof the Hazard Communication Standard cannot logically be used to ``prove''that the provisions of the Formaldehyde Standard and the HCS do not imposesubstantively similar requirements for the labeling of containers of woodproducts emitting formaldehyde.Objections to the 0.1 ppm cutoff level arise in part from the contentionthat manufacturers will have difficulty in determining the extent to whichone of their products will offgas sufficient formaldehyde in its downstreamapplications to trigger the labeling requirement. In this context, it issignificant that the FS rulemaking record reflects overwhelming supportfor the concept of a de minimis exemption from the labeling requirement.OSHA decided to accede to the comments on this issue and fashion a de minimisexemption from the hazard communication provisions for formaldehyde. Regardlessof the precise cutoff that is utilized, determinations as to whether tolabel containers of specific products that approach that point will benecessary.Furthermore, OSHA believes that this argument greatly exaggerates the difficultyof determining whether the labeling provision applies. The vast majorityof formaldehyde-containing products either offgas so little formaldehydethat the 0.1 ppm exemption clearly applies, or offgas so much that it clearlydoes not. In OSHA's experience under other standards, even the borderlinesituations are not generally that difficult to decide. For example, theAsbestos Standard, which requires labeling when potential employee exposureexceeds 0.1 f/cc, and the Ethylene Oxide Standard, which requires labelingwhen potential exposure exceeds 0.5 ppm, are two recent standards wheremanufacturers' obligations depend on downstream worker exposure. In trueborderline cases, OSHA advises manufacturers to act in a manner consistentwith the intent of the hazard communication provisions to encourage freeexchange of information. Exactly the same advice is given under the HCS.Finally, we note that many of the industry objections to the labeling requirementof the Formaldehyde Standard focus on the content of the required label,the fact that it must contain the information ``Potential Cancer Hazard''.These objections are not relevant to this proceeding, of course, sincethe content of a label is not a factor in the paperwork burden imposedby a labeling requirement.\3\<NOTE/> In any event, the scientific evidence in the rulemaking recordabundantly supports OSHA's conclusion that formaldehyde is a potentialoccupational carcinogen. Formaldehyde causes cancers in two species oflaboratory animals as shown in a number of studies (Preamble, 52 FR at46204 to 46210). Formaldehyde causes nasal cancer in humans (Preamble,52 FR at 46183 to 46785). These conclusions were shared by many commentersin the rulemaking record, and OSHA is confident that they are correct.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\OSHA agrees with OMB that the carcinogenicity of a toxicsubstance is not reviewable under the Paperwork Reduction Act. As OMB explainedat its hearing on the paperwork burden of the Hazard Communication Standard:``This is a paperwork meeting and while the Hazard Communication Standardis indeed mostly paperwork and therefore the issues will be very broad-ranging,I would like to point out that the specific regulatory issues are reallynot the scope of this meeting. For an example, it would not be appropriateto discuss whether a particular chemical was or was not a carcinogen underthis Hazard Communication Standard. It would, perhaps be appropriate todiscuss the difficulty in ascertaining whether a chemical is a carcinogenand in some generic information collection issue arising from that.'' (Transcriptfrom the OMB hearing on the Hazard Communication Standard, page 13.) Inthis context we note that any difficulty or burden on an employer in determiningwhether formaldehyde is a carcinogen under the Hazard Communication Standardor whether the cancer risks from formaldehyde exposure may be consideredde minimis are eliminated by the Formaldehyde Standard.In summary, OSHA believes that the hazard communication provisions of theFS impose a paperwork burden no greater than that imposed no manufacturersof formaldehyde-containing products by the HCS. The differences betweenthe requirements of the two standards are based on the particular characteristicsof formaldehyde, and the FS requires fewer labels on formaldehyde-containingproducts than required by the HCS. As we explain below, the remaining hazardcommunication requirements of the FS make determinations appropriate fora substance-specific standard, and reduce manufacturers' assessment andanalysis burdens without adding to their paperwork burden. These precisionscontribute to a more stable, predictable, and efficient enforcement environmentfor the regulated community.<T3>c. The hazard communication provisions of the Formaldehyde Standardare consistent with longstanding OSHA policy. </T3>OSHA has required cancerwarnings on labels for regulated carcinogens throughout its history. Sincethe promulgation of the HCS, OSHA has adopted toxic substance standardsfor ethylene oxide, asbestos, benzene, and formaldehyde. All of these substancescause cancer, and OSHA has required cancer warnings in each instance. Differencesin approach from standard to standard are justified by individual rulemakingrecords. Thus, the absence of an enforceable cancer warning requirementfrom the Formaldehyde Standard could be viewed as a departure from a longstandingOSHA policy. As recent decisions of the Supreme Court and the courts ofappeals emphasize, good reasons for such a departure are necessary.For the Benzene Standard (29 CFR 1910.1028) OSHA provided a complete exemptionfrom the standard for containers and pipelines carrying mixtures with lessthan 0.1 percent benzene. This provision was justified by extensive comment,data, and discussion (see 52 FR 34524 to 34526), and was based upon knownproperties of benzene. Similarly, the Formaldehyde Standard's labelingprovision applies to mixtures and solutions if they contain greater than0.1 percent formaldehyde. However, a similar content-triggered provisionis not appropriate for other formaldehyde products. Unlike benzene, formaldehydeis known to offgas from solid materials. Formaldehyde is generated fromresins used to manufacture wood products and permanent press cloth. Therefore,the use of an across-the-board percent exclusion for all formaldehyde products(as used in the Benzene Standard) is not appropriate for the FormaldehydeStandard (see 52 FR 46282 to 46285), and the Formaldehyde Standard usesa different approach, that is, determining when to label ``materials''capable of releasing formaldehyde.In a like manner, the differences in the labeling provisions of the AsbestosStandard. 29 CFR 1910.1001, reflect the differences between asbestos andformaldehyde. Asbestos is a solid material that will not become airborneunless the asbestos-containing material is disturbed or otherwise processed.In contrast, formaldehyde-containing materials may spontaneously offgasformaldehyde without disturbing the material. In addition, the AsbestosStandard covered mined products where asbestos may be a trace contaminantin the product but asbestos is not intentionally added to the product.The Asbestos Standard covered products that have bonded materials containingasbestos (see 51 FR 22698 to 22699). However, both formaldehyde and asbestosshare the common feature that the labeling provisions are set at levelsthat approach the lowest measurable level using current analytical techniques.OSHA completed the bulk of the ethylene oxide rulemaking prior to adoptionof the HCS. The hazard communication provision in that standard, whichis triggered at the 0.5 ppm action level, was adopted on the basis of thatrulemaking record, and reflects the difficulty of accurately measuringethylene oxide concentrations below 0.5 ppm.d. <T3>Enforcement of the specific hazard communication provisions of theFormaldehyde Standard is the most effective method of achieving the goalsof both the Formaldehyde and the Hazard Communication Standards.</T3> OSHAadopted the Formaldehyde Standard to address formaldehyde's health hazardsin numerous ways. Thus, the standard contains a lowered permissible exposurelimit, but also features such provisions as a medical surveillance requirementand worker-awareness provisions such as the cancer warning label requirement.These provisions are designed to work together; no single provision achievesOSHA's goal of worker protection in isolation from the others. Thus, OSHAmade a judgment that inclusion of a cancer warning label was a necessarypart of this complete toxic substance standard which, taken as a whole,will eliminate significant risk of cancer. In adopting the standard, theAgency stated, ``OSHA believes that the entire standard for formaldehydewith a 1 ppm TWA and a 2 ppm STEL, and industrial hygiene and medical provisionswill likely decrease the risk of exposure to levels more representativeof the lower end of the range of risks, and possibly to even lower values.Under such circumstances, OSHA believes that residual risk can be considered`insignificant.' '' \4\<NOTE/> Preamble, 52 FR at 46224. However, OSHA has consistenly andrepeatedly stressed the integrated nature of the Formaldehyde Standardand the importance of complying with all of the standard's provisions toreduce risk. The OSH Act instructs the Agency to prescribe appropriatewarning labels in section 6(b) standards. The effect of the disapprovalof these paragraphs under the Paperwork Reduction Act is effect keeps OSHAfrom complying with its mandate. Without the cancer warning label, thestandards's effectiveness would be diminished, since the risks to workerswill be at the high end of OSHA's quantitative risk assessment and significantresidual risks will remain. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Contrary to some industry assertions, however, OSHA hasnever taken the position that exposure to 0.1 ppm of formaldehyde posesno risk. For example, in the preamble to the Formaldehyde Standard, OSHAstates ``The figures . . . which were derived from the analysis of theCIIT rat data and the 5-stage multistage model conducted in the ORA Report(Ex. 43) remain elevant to OSHA's final assessment of extra risk from exposureto formaldehyde.'' Preamble, 52 FR at 46220. These figures unequivocallyshow that some cancer risk exists at 0.1 ppm. Specifically, Table 3 statesthat the lifetime risk of cancer per 100,000 workers exposed to 0.1 ppmis between 0.001 (maximum likelihood estimate) and 26 (upper confidencelimit).  The Formaldehyde Standard hazard communication requirements are tailoredto fit the particular characteristics of formaldehyde and to give guidanceas to what action is necessary and when to comply with the labeling provisions.Therefore, these provisions are very useful for the employer and shouldbe approved by OMB. While a careful reading of the HCS should lead an employerto realize that the same requirements apply, it is possible that some employers,even though acting in good faith, might not interpret the HCS requirementscorrectly for formaldehyde. To leave this HCS provision in place in lieuof the more clear and concise formaldehyde provision would not only doa disservice to employers who want to comply, it might also adversely affectemployees who would not have the benefit of the appropriate label. Moreover,such a policy might lead to citations that would be avoidable if the clearerFormaldehyde Standard provisions were allowed to stand. While using the labeling provisions of the HCS as a basis for those inthe Formaldehyde Standard, OSHA made certain minor modifications to allowfor the peculiarities of formaldehyde. As shown above, these changes clearlydefine a formaldehyde-releasing material may be described as nonhazardous;this may result in slightly less labeling of formaldehyde-bearing productsthan under the HCS since manufacturers can have greater confidence thatthey are complying with the standard. OSHA believes that the record containsample evidence to support this approach and that it is not appropriateto invite extensive litigation to ``establish'' that these requirementsare enforceable for formaldehyde under the HCS by disapproving paragraphs(m)(1)(i) through (m)(4)(ii). OSHA believes that the Formaldehyde Standard promulgation process, usingthe rulemaking authority of Section 6(b) of the OSH Act with administrativerulemaking procedures including publication of proposed rules, public comment,and hearings, has addressed the relevant issues regarding formaldehydelabeling.\5\<NOTE/> One of the purposes of a substance-specific rulemaking proceedingis to let employers know exactly what actions are necessary to comply withthe final rule. In the Formaldehyde Standard, OSHA has clearly articulatedwhat actions are necessary to provide appropriate hazard communicationfor formaldehyde. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Based upon the comments received by OSHA, some membersof the regulated community continue to argue that, under the Hazard CommunicationStandard, ``appropriate hazard warnings'' do not include a cancer warningin the case of formaldehyde. A longstanding Agency interpretation of theHCS is that formaldehyde labels must contain a cancer warning. (See memoto the field, Sept. 1986, Appendix II). The Formaldehyde Institute raisedthis issue during the formaldehyde hearings. The Formaldehyde Institutedoes not agree with the Agency's resolution of the issue, as shown by itscomments to OMB. However, as OMB and OSHA recognized, see fn. 2. supra,substantive disputes of this type are not proper subjects for PaperworkReduction Act consideration. OSHA's inability to enforce paragraphs (m)(1)(i) through (m)(4)(ii) ofthe FS will lead to extensive, complex, costly, and possibly wasteful litigation.Generally courts give great weight to the interpretation of the drafterof a regulation. On the other hand, agencies are encouraged to promulgateclear and enforceable rules that give plain notice of their requirementsto the regulated parties. To invite repeated litigation under the HCS insteadof enforcing the FS is counterproductive to these policies and is contraryto the spirit of the Paperwork Reduction Act. OSHA does not believe that disagreements regarding the details of appropriatehazard communication for formaldehyde should be resolve in enforcementdisputes before the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. First,this approach is not an efficient use of resources. Litigating multiplecontested cases before an Administrative Law Judge of the OccupationalSafety and Health Review Commission would require spending extensive resourcesby both the Agency and industry. Each case would require extensive evidentiarydevelopment and use of witnesses. Upon appeal, each case could be reviewedby the three member panel of the Review Commission (which at this pointcontains only one member and would be unable to overrule and ALJ decision),and further appeals would be heard by the U.S. Court of Appeals. Second, OSHA's administrative rulemaking process has resulted in an evaluationof the toxicity of formaldehyde that is far more extensive than could beprepared by indivdual OSHA field offices, an employer who is contestinga citation, or an Administrative Law Judge. OSHA's public meeting and rulemakinghearing records contain considerable testimony of experts in the field,including presentations by scientists who performed the primary research.It would not be feasible or practical to have this type of open hearingand detailed analysis occur in various contested citation cases. As a resultof this rulemaking, OSHA has decided how to address this issue in the formaldehyderule. OSHA does not believe that the industry's disagreement with OHSA'sconclusion regarding the toxicity of formaldehyde is sufficient reasonto revoke the labeling provisions of the Formaldehyde Standard. e. <T3>Conclusion.</T3> OSHA believes that a number of factors should be takeninto consideration to mitigate its failure to comply with the precise letterof the Paperwork Reduction Act. The public had notice of the Agency's intendedcourse of action early in the formaldehyde rulemaking process and had extensiveopportunity to comment on this issue among others. In addition, the regulationunderwent extensive OMB review under Executive Order 12291 before promulgationand certain changes were made pursuant to that review. Therefore it wouldhave been possible to submit the Paperwork Clearance package until thisreview was complete. Moreover, the standard was promulgated under intense time pressure, incompliance with a judicially-imposed deadline. In fact, the petitionersin the case had requested that the Agency be held in contempt of courtif the date was not met. The Agency's failure to give 60 days advance noticeto OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act, when under this extreme judicialpressure to nullify the extensive opportunity the public has already hadto comment on and discuss the issue. Yet this would be the result if theAgency is forced to initiate a new rulemaking proceeding on this issueso that the letter of the Paperwork Act may be followed. We believe thatthis unnecessarily inflexible course is inconsistent with the objectivesof both the Paperwork Reduction Act and the Occupational Safety and HealthAct. 13. Estimate of Annual Burden Hours The burden hour estimates are based on the information contained in theRegulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) prepared by OSHA in November 1987. OSHAhas estimated that there are no burden hours for the hazard communicationprovisions of the Formaldehyde Standard. The other paperwork provisionsof the Formaldehyde Standard have a burden of 955,043 hours which wereapproved until February 29, 1991. Approval of the hazard communicationprovisions would not change the overall burden hours of the Standard. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,tp0,i1,s25,7,7</C> <H1> </H1><H1>1st year, initial</H1><H1>2d andamp; 3d years, recurring</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Hazard communication<D>0</D><D>0</D></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="84">II.
