(SCJ) in Racine, Wis., knows whatteamwork is all about.andP;  Since 1987, the U.S.andP;  Consumer Products division ofthis company has been engaged in the biggest systems project in itshistory--rewriting and bridging 25 applications systems in an effort to raisecustomer service to a level that will carry it through the 1990s and beyond.andM;The project, called CICSS, for Computer Integration of Customer ServiceSystems, is nearing completion ahead of schedule and well under its $5million budget.andP;  SCJ went further than systems implementation to create a newfunctional organization, Customer Service and Logistics, which is now incharge of the entire life cycle of customer service, from the entry of theorder through delivery and post-sales support.andP;  CICSS is the organization'stechnological platform.andM;Getting the SpiritandM;The chief factor in the project's success was &quot;the spirit of cooperation,&quot;says Cory Mason, senior information services manager of CICSS.andP;  &quot;Without it,the best technology and methods would have failed.&quot;andM;In 1986, SCJ, a privately held company still led by the founding family(Samuel C. Johnson, chairman), celebrated its centennial.andP;  Outside estimatesput revenues at $2.5 billion, and the company was enjoying a long-heldleadership position in the market for household and personal care products.andO;Most consumers have grown up with its brands such as, Pledge, Future, Shout,Glade, Edge Shaving Gel and RAID!andM;Yet, at the same time, demands from retailers of SCJ's products wereescalating, and the distribution channels were changing.andP;  SCJ had alreadydetermined that it wanted to be more customer-focused, and it hadcommissioned studies to find out how customers rated its products andservices and what they were looking for in the future.andM;What SCJ learned from its customer survey was that retailers and distributorswanted SCJ to become more proactive.andP;  &quot;They hate surprises,&quot; such asdiscovering that an order will be late on the day it's due, says Dave Henry,vice president of the new Customer Services and Logistics organization.andO;&quot;They want us to anticipate such problems and pose alternative solutions.&quot;andO;they also need a more strategic alliance with their suppliers so they canmatch inventory availability to promotional plans or consolidate separateorders for different products to get the best deals.andM;&quot;We determined that we had an archaic order-processing system,&quot; Henry says.andO;&quot;It had served us well in the '60s and '70s, but didn't meet our standards inthe '80s and certainly would not in the '90s.&quot;andM;SCJ, like many consumer products companies, was suffering from its share ofproblems with inaccurate invoices and orders that didn't arrive on time,arrived incomplete or with the wrong products in the box.andP;  The reasons forthis were that no one was really focusing on the customers' needs.andP;  Finance,manufacturing, distribution, sales and marketing each had a job to do andeach did that job to meet its own objectives.andP;  For instance, the fulltruckload would save $250, but at what cost in customer dissatisfaction?andM;Further, each organizational unit handled its part through its own dedicatedinformation systems and its own databases, and the information traffic wentonly one way.andM;No one person, no one system and no one database tracked the entire lifecycle of an order from entry through delivery.andP;  The result too often was thatwhen someone in the chain failed, the bad news had to come from an unhappycustomer.andM;These concerns led the company to create a customer service department whosemain charter would be to implement and manage a new order-processing system.andO;But that effort soon bogged down, says Mason.andP;  The scope of the departmentwas limited to automating the order itself, instead of being concerned withwhat happened after the order was transferred from order entry todistribution.andP;  Solving the systems problem required understanding the entireprocess of delivering products to the customers.andM;Using the Power of Top ExecsandM;So, in July 1987, the company took two actions.andP;  One was to form a steeringcommittee of vice presidents from all of the organizations involved:distribution, customer service, sales and information services.andP;  Their jobwas to agree on what should be done and drive the changes.andM;The second action was to find a strong individual to manage the project, acatalyst who could ensure the balance of business objectives, user needs andsystems capabilities.andP;  Committee member Don Houselander, director ofinformation services for U.S.andP;  Consumer Products, puts it this way: &quot;In thiskind of effort, a gorilla is needed to ward off corporate fights over turfand make sure everyone is focused on the vision.&quot;andM;Gorilla HuntingandM;Houselander was charged by the committee with finding that &quot;gorilla.&quot;andP;  Hechose Mason, an 18-year SCJ veteran, who was well known throughout theorganization not only for his involvement in pioneering projects but for histeam-oriented philosophy and style.andM;Mason was the common thread in all the teams involved.andP;  First, he chaired theSteering Committee.andP;  Then, he and the director of the customer servicedepartment, Andy Dykstra, and the director of the logistics department, DickAlbregts, joined to become the pivotal tactical team.andP;  This trio formed theplan for CICSS and later served as the liaisons between the SteeringCommittee and the CICSS implementation team--which Mason also created andmanaged.andM;Within six months, Mason says, the tactical team mapped the businessfunctions involved in the entire customer service life cycle and theirinterrelationships.andP;  The team then developed a high-level systemsarchitecture identifying the interconnection of systems, the informationflows and the applications needed.andM;PRESENTING AN AMBITIOUS PLANandM;The tactical took its plans to the Steering Committee and to the U.S.andO;Consumer Products executive committee chaired by the executive vicepresident, George Delp.andP;  &quot;We presented a case for developing 25 computersystems which would span all customer service and distribution functions anddeeply involve us in electronic data interchange with customers, distributorsand carriers,&quot; Mason emphasizes.andP;  &quot;We went through it step by step, showinghow business processes were going to be reengineered, and we talked in termsof orders and schedules, not in terms of technology.&quot;andM;Senior management approved and designated CICSS as the No.andP;  1 systemspriority in the U.S.andP;  Consumer Products division.andP;  The CICSS project had itschampion, Delp, the executive vice president, who controlled IS priorities.andM;The mission was clear--to seek differentiation by focusing on the customerand on service.andP;  The individual priorities of individual organizational unitshad to be secondary to that goal.andM;The CICSS TeamandM;From the IS point of view, the Steering Committee and the tactical team werethe external teams, says Mason.andP;  He also created the internal CICSS team todefine and develop the 25 systems.andM;Previously at SCJ, Mason had led a cross-functional effort incomputer-integrated manufacturing (CIM) for the manufacturing division.andP;  Hiswork on the CIM project gave him a head start.andP;  That project was not only across-functional system but also the first SCJ project to use the Naturalfourth-generation programming language and Software AG's Adabas databasemanagement system, which became company standards.andM;The experience gave Mason the model for CICSS in terms of the makeup andresponsibilities of each team, methods for systems development and effectivemanagerial style.andP;  &quot;As with any major product development,&quot; says Mason, &quot;myteam needed [to perform] three separate functions to be successful, whichfundamentally amounted to research/development, production and post-salessupport.&quot;andM;Mason saw that the teams could not be made up entirely of IS staffers.andP;  &quot;Ihad to convince people that the systems could not be developed independent ofthe client,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;We needed an IS/client partnership.&quot;andM;The Randamp;D teams developed the functional specifications.andP;  &quot;They had to bepeople who had to have credibility with end users.&quot;andP;  This meant experts notfrom IS but from the functions involved.andP;  Specialized teams were convened aseach system came up for development; the teams disbanded after the design wascompleted.andP;  The project managers for each team, however, continued to workafter the team disbanded.andP;  The role of the project manager was then totranslate these specifications for the production team.andM;The production team was drawn from the systems and programming staff, whichnumbered between 13 and 17 people during the project.andM;Post-sales support came from Client Services, again two non-IS staffers, whowere responsible for training, documentation and post-implementation usersupport.andP;  They had final say over screens and other features affecting use.andO;&quot;This fumction was critical, since we were going to be changing the jobs ofmore than 500 people, most of whom were going to be on line for the firsttime,&quot; says Mason.andM;The entire permanent staff (excluding the specialized teams) comprised only20 people.andP;  &quot;Think about what we faced,&quot; Mason says.andP;  The project itself wasenormous, encompassing not only the 25 interconnected systems but severalmajor databases in five major areas:andM;* Traditional order processing, including order entry, deal setup, dealprofiles, pricing, invoicing and credit checking.andM;* Customer service, including customer profiles, customer service analysisand available-to-promise data (supply and demand comparisons).andM;* Physical distribution, such as shipment confirmation, distributionrequirements planning, carrier profiles, transportation management andshipping schedules.andM;* Inventory management.andM;* Electronic data interchange spanning the customer, warehouse and carriercommunications systems.andM;To make matters more complicated, SCJ was implementing its new system in themidst of a corporatewide conversion from a Honeywell DPS8 GCOS to an IBM 3090MVS system.andP;  However, the Honeywell-to-IBM conversion, while complicatingmatters, was actually a blessing.andP;  Because of it, the company had alreadycommitted major resources to Information Services, which meant CICSS did nothave to struggle for funds; IS had already standardized on Natural and Adabasas the technology for new applications and all databases; and corporatepersonnel were already expecting the shift from batch to on-line processing.andM;Still, the corporate technical environment was complex and confusing, to saythe least.andP;  Because the conversion was going on, the Honeywell Inc. and IBMsystems were being run in parallel, and for a while the CICSS systems had tofeed information into both.andP;  Some applications, written in COBOL, were simplybeing translated, while new ones were being written in Natural.andP;  HoneywellIDS databases were being converted to Adabas.andP;  The CICSS team had to workwith the corporate database administrators on the data structure and withInformation Services to bridge CICSS applications to other applications inthe organization.andM;Teamwork Begins at HomeandM;Steve Hrpcek, a CIM colleague Mason brought in to supervise the systems andprogramming team, recalls the turmoil that existed at first.andP;  &quot;There wereconsultants from other companies, IS staff new to the company who variouslyhad IBM, Natural and Adabas experience but didn't know the Honeywell systems,veteran staff who hadn't worked on the new technology and the non-IS people,&quot;i.e., the specialized team project managers saand individuals from ClientServices.andM;&quot;Some of these people had worked on the initial order entry project, so therewere turf issues between old and new, staff and consultants,&quot; Hrpcekexplains.andP;  &quot;The traditional systems people didn't like being told how todesign screens by the Client Services people.&quot;andM;Hrpcek entered the fray with some trepidation, reminding himself that seniormanagement was solidly behind the project.andM;But the cold war ended, Hrpcek says, after completion of the first system,order entry, early in 1988.andP;  Because it was a success?andP;  &quot;Oh no, it was afailure, full of design flaws and programming errors.andP;  It was a very complexsophisticated system, but we really couldn't bring it off because the teamstill wasn't singing out of the same hymnal.andP;  We had some skeptics out therewho believed the project was too big to be successful, and this failure didsomething.andP;  Suddenly we had a group of people who realized that if CICSS wasgoing to happen, they had to work well together.&quot;andM;Role of IS and TechnologyandM;Certain technological choices contributed to the success of the project.andO;There's no question in Mason's mind that the use of fourth-generationtechnology has contributed to finishing CICSS in less than three years.andP;  &quot;Ifwe'd used COBOL, this would have been a six-year project.&quot;andP;  Because of thelearn-as-you-go nature of the effort, it was important that the systes beeasy to prototype in design and reengineer in implementation, capabilitiesafforded by Natural and Adabas.andM;&quot;The DBMS product allowed us to dynamically change our views of the databaseand add fields,&quot; says Mason.andP;  &quot;So we really didn't have to prespecify all ourdata structures before we started.andP;  And that meant didn't have toover-engineer up front, thankfully, because our view of many systems haschanged dramatically over the last three years.andM;&quot;The database administrators worked with us to lay out the overallarchitecture and determine the logical and physical contents of the datastructures.andP;  What was important was that DBA focused on the data from alogical perspective and a cross-functional perspective.andP;  They emphasized thebusiness activity rather than the organzational unit.&quot;andM;After most of the systems were in place, top management realized that thecompany needed more than a customer service department.andP;  Rather, it needed adepartment in charge of the entire process, everything short of sales.andP;  Andso it created the Computer Services and Logistics department.andP;  Thisdepartment, the company felt, could better match resources to needs than anyof the separate, existing functional units.andM;At this point, about three months short of the deadline, the CICSS team onlyhas to complete two more applications systems.andP;  With that, the foundationwill be laid for  future enhancements, which won't be difficult to identifybecause just one organization, Computer Services and Logistics, now overseesthe entire process.andP;  Computer Services and Logistics is responsible for orderprocessing, the customer service staff, deal administration, pricing,distribution and inventory management.andM;CICSS is now serving more than 500 people doing 150,000 transactions a week.andO;Orders come in, inventory is assigned and protected, and shipping makes sureloads go out complete and on time.andP;  Customer service representatives knowwhen a problem crops up anywhere in the chain, can quickly move to resolve itand can analyze patterns of service desruption.andP;  Sales reps can use theirlaptops to find out the current status of an order.andP;  Management can quicklyanalyze patterns of customer activity to develop more mutually profitableprograms with the custome.andM;&quot;We are really in an embryonic stage,&quot; Henry says.andP;  &quot;CICSS will never end.andP;  .andO;.  .  We have the foundation in place now to be proactive.andP;  We have theteam.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
