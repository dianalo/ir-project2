But the two-day summit of the East Bloc military alliance in theRomanian capital ended with no concrete proposals on arms control orvisible signs of healing in rifts that divide the bloc.   In remarks at a dinner Friday, Soviet President Mikhail S.Gorbachev said the annual gathering would give a ``serious, palpableanswer'' to Western proposals on cuts in conventional forcesannounced by Bush May 29 at a NATO summit in Brussels, Belgium.   On behalf of the 16-member North Atlantic Treaty Organization,Bush called for military cutbacks that would fix a ceiling of275,000 troops in Europe for each superpower and make deep cuts intanks, combat aircraft and artillery.   In a joint declaration, the Warsaw Pact countries said the Bushplan converged with their proposals, and that rapid progress innegotiating cuts was now possible.   ``During the meeting it was noted that the additional proposalsregarding conventional armed forces in Europe made at the recentNATO Council summit session met halfway the allied socialistcountries' stand,'' the Eastern alliance said.   Member countries of the Warsaw Pact _ the Soviet Union, Poland,East Germany, Bulgaria, Romania, Czechoslovakia and Hungary _ saidthey expected details of the NATO proposals to be put forward inVienna, Austria, where both sides are participating in conventionalarms reduction talks.   Even without knowing the fine print of Bush's proposal, whichwill be formally presented in September, the Warsaw Pact saidconditions are ripe for agreement.   ``The opinion was expressed that the situation of thenegotiations is such that the first understandings may be achievedalready in 1990, provided that a constructive approach is taken byall,'' the declaration said.   The Warsaw Pact has proposed a limit of 1.35 million troops foreach side in Europe.   According to NATO, to comply with Bush's plan the United Stateswould have to remove 30,000 troops from Europe, while the Sovietswould have to pull out more than 10 times that, or 325,000.   However, the Soviet-led alliance cautioned that despiteencouraging signs such as the superpower treaty eliminatingintermediate-range missiles, ``no radical turning point indisarmament questions has been recorded yet.''   It accused NATO of continuing a ``policy of force'' and said theWestern alliance's nuclear deterrent strategy still causes worry.   The final document repeated Kremlin demands that the UnitedStates drop plans to modernize short-range nuclear weapons inEurope, and instead negotiate their elimination.   The pact also proposed creation of a ``center for lessening themilitary theat'' in Europe to prevent surprise attacks by serving asa clearinghouse for information and consultation.   The 16-page Russian-language document repeated Warsaw Pactproposals for bans on all nuclear and chemical weapons and theliquidation of both military blocs to do away the division of Europebequeathed by the Cold War.   The Romanian deputy foreign minister, Constantin Oancea, told anews conference that the Warsaw Pact's decision showed it ``isseeking a dialogue with all European countries.''   The summit declaration and a separate communique made no mentionof quarrels in the bloc, some of which are based on ideology, andothers on centuries-old rivalries.   ``We met here as equals without trying to divide,'' said Oancea,secretary- general of the pact's political consultative committee.``We did not come here to give grades or marks to one another.''   In line with Gorbachev's pledge that the Kremlin would no longerinterfere in the affairs of its allies, the Warsaw Pact declared ina seperate communique that each member country has the ``right tomake its own political lines, strategy and tactics without anyoutside interference.''   Gorbachev, in an interview with the Soviet television news showVremya, repeated predictions that the Warsaw Pact would betransformed from a military into a political alliance.   ``The time will come when the need for it will disappear,'' hesaid, and called for another Warsaw Pact meeting to chart economiccooperation.   ``We must not be too slow here. We must act, because ... the factthat we have fallen behind in a number of important directions istelling upon the level of well being, and, naturally, on the livingstandards of our people.''   Gorbachev returned to Moscow Saturday at the head of a delegationthat included Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, Defense MinisterDmitri Yazov, Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov and Politburo member AlexanderYakovlev.   The Warsaw Pact held its closed-door summit in Bucharest'sglittering former royal palace.   Access granted reporters bore little sign of the greater opennessnow encouraged by Gorbachev. Journalists were, however, allowed tobe present for dinner remarks Friday by Gorbachev and his host,Romanian President Nicolai Ceausescu, as well as the brief signingceremony Saturday.   Gorbachev used a black fountain pen to put his signature with abold flourish on the agreement, bound in red leather, and smiled atjournalists gathered in the marble-columned hall.   One veteran of many Warsaw Pact summits, East German PresidentErich Honecker, took ill and flew home Saturday morning, missing theceremony.</TEXT></DOC>
