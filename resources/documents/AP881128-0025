One proposed design, the smaller and more expensive of twoenvisioned, involves technologies that some engineers believe willlead to commercial reactors that drastically reduce the dangers ofmeltdown and contamination.   Building new reactors has assumed new urgency since April, whenengineers last were able to safely operate the remaining threeproduction reactors at the Savannah River Plant near Aiken, S.C.   ``We feel that we can make the plants at the Savannah River Plantoperate safely, although they are nearing the end of theiroperational lives,'' said Ron Cochran, head of the Energy Departmentoffice for the new reactors.   The first of the Savannah River reactors is not expected toresume production of tritium, a critical nuclear weapons material,before January. The new reactors should begin operation in about1999, said Cochran.   However, persuading Congress to approve funding for both reactorsmay be impossible, given the budget deficit and the $110 billion theEnergy Department says it will need to clean up the existing complexand make it safe.   An Energy Department advisory panel, in a report last July, found``that one of the challenges was to get a new production reactorbuilt before the Savannah River Plant reactors reach the end oftheir useful lives,'' said Cochran.   The Energy Research Advisory Board recommended building two newreactors, a heavy-water reactor at Savannah River for an estimated$3.2 billion and a gas-cooled reactor at the Idaho NationalEngineering Laboratory Reservation, an Energy Department site nearIdaho Falls, Idaho, for about $3.6 billion.   ``The point of having two is to provide the maximum level ofassurance ... at two geographic locations, so that nothing like aseismic event could shut down production,'' said Cochran.   Like the three existing reactors, the new one at Savannah Riverwould use heavy water as a moderator. It have new safety and designfeatures, but rely on tritium extraction techniques that have beenproven since 1954.   The new Savannah River reactor would be adequate to make all ofthe tritium needed for nuclear weapons and the gas-cooled reactor inIdaho would produce at half that rate.   Both would be built with containment vessels, steel-reinforcedconcrete domes like that which prevented the escape of nearly allthe lethal materials from the Three Mile Island accident in March1979. The current Savannah River Plant reactors rely instead onthick concrete walls and air-filtration systems to confineradioactivity.   Despite its smaller production capacity and igher cost, thegas-cooled reactor planned for Idaho has many advantages.   In high-pressure light-water reactors, fuel can reach 4,100degrees Fahrenheit, hot enough to melt the casing and turn the fuelinto an uncontrollable molten mass if the flow of cooling water isinterrupted.   In a gas-cooled reactor, meanwhile, uranium grains can reach amaximum temperature of 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit while the shells inwhich they are encased do not deteriorate below 3,300 degrees,making a meltdown or radiation leak theoretically impossible even ifthe flow of coolant stops for an indefinite period.   The gas-cooled reactor at Idaho Falls also could generate dollarsby generating commercial electricity through the year 2038, Cochransaid.   Lawmakers from South Carolina and Idaho already are beginning tomaneuver to make sure that their states are not left out as plansfor the reactors move forward.   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., at an Oct. 5 hearing before theSenate Armed Services subcommittee on Strategic Forces and NuclearDeterrence, said he wanted to ``commend the Department of Energy onits recent decision to locate the New Production Reactor at theSavannah River Plant'' and would keep an eye on its progress.   But Idaho's Sen. James McClure, also a Republican, has chargedEnergy Department officials at the South Carolina field office withsuppressing a 1985 report on problems at Savannah River in order toderail plans for a new production reactor elsewhere.   If the facts had come out in 1985, McClure said in an Oct. 7speech on the Senate floor, ``we would be breaking ground right nowon a New Production Reactor. And it would not be at Savannah River.''   The Energy Department is holding local hearings near the proposedsites, including one scheduled for Tuesday in Aiken.</TEXT></DOC>
