<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-85-1033 </DOCNO><TEXT>The luminosity function in a field of M13 at 14 core radii has been observedto M(V) = +12.0, and new theoretical, low-mass, stellar models appropriateto M13 are used to convert the function to a mass function which extendsto M = 0.18 solar, within a factor of two of brown dwarf masses at thismetal abundance. As the number of stars observed in each magnitude binis still increasing at the limit of the data, the presence of stars withmasses lower than 0.18 solar is probable. This result sets an upper limitof 0.18 solar mass for low-mass cutoffs in dynamical models of M13. Nosingle power law mass function fits all the observations. The trend ofthe data supports the idea of a steep increase in the slope of the massfunction for M less than 0.4 solar. The results imply that the totalmass in low-mass stars in M13, and by implication elsewhere, is higherthan was previously thought. 26 references.</TEXT></DOC>
