Edson D. de Castro, president and chief executive officer of the computer maker, said that directors made an internal study as part of &quot;doing our homework&quot; in the midst of widespread rumors of a possible hostile takeover. He said &quot;from a cash-flow standpoint it wasn't doable.&quot; The company hasn't been a target of either a hostile or friendly acquisition, he added.    Separately, Data General said that it received a research and development contract from Nippon Telegraph andamp; Telephone Corp. to design new communications sytems to link voice, data and computer devices in large communications networks.    Data General declined to disclose the value of the contract, but an NTT official said that over a five-year period starting in 1989, his company expects to buy about $130 million of equipment developed by Data General under the agreement.    Analysts said the contract could be significant for Data General, which has had weak operating results, layoffs and write-downs and expensive lawsuit settlements in the past 18 months.    In New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Data General stock rose 37.5 cents to close at $35.375.    Data General hadn't disclosed its consideration of the leveraged buy-out but word leaked out in filings related to executive vice president Herbert Richman's divorce case.    In a leveraged buy-out, a company is acquired in a transaction financed largely by borrowing. Ultimately, the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or sale of its assets.    Frederick Adler, a Data General director and venture capitalist, said that during a board meeting he suggested the company &quot;ought to think about protective measures,&quot; in the light of market activity and the fact that &quot;the stock was weak.&quot; He said, &quot;It was just number running. No investment bank or commercial bank was hired. There was no LBO firm.&quot; But, he said, &quot;the cash flow just wasn't there and the whole thing was dumped.&quot;    Data General is frequently the subject of takeover speculation because it would be cheaper to acquire than most other computer makers. Data General executives evaluated spending as much as $45 a share, or $1.2 billion, in the leveraged buyout.    Under the agreement with Nippon Telegraph, Nippon will provide much of the funding for development work Data General is doing in the telecommunications field. Although Data General doesn't make many communications products currently, it has acquired related businesses in recent years. &quot;The NTT contract is a vote of confidence that we are on the right track technologically,&quot; said Mr. de Castro.    Data General has had trouble getting big U.S. companies to buy from it in recent years because such customers worried it wasn't as reliable a supplier as International Business Machines Corp. or Digital Equipment Corp. Stephen Dube, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc, said the NTT contract &quot;raises their credibility in international markets. Lack of credibility has been a debilitating problem for them.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
