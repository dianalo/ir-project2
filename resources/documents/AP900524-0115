Boesky's credibility as prosecution starwitness in a securities fraud trial took another blistering assaulttoday from a defense lawyer seeking to portray him as amoney-grubber who might have cheated on his taxes.   Separately, it was disclosed that Boesky took a $50 million taxdeduction in 1986, accounting for half of the $100 million he paidthe government to settle its criminal insider trading case againsthim.   Boesky, on the stand for a third day in the trial of formerfriend John A. Mulheren Jr., seemed more comfortable facing theaggressive questioning of defense attorney Thomas P. Puccio afterreacting with testy indignation to Wednesday's cross-examination.   The trial is the first time Boesky, Wall Street's most famousfelon, has testified publicly about his own crimes and the allegedoffenses of others he has implicated in a web of financial marketcorruption in the 1980s.   Puccio unsuccessfully sought to make Boesky admit that he wasterrified of losing his fortune and had transferred vast amounts ofmoney under his wife's name before he settled charges with thegovernment.   Boesky, who surrendered $100 million in penalties and fines,faces numerous civil lawsuits and spent two years in a federalprison, long has claimed his legal ordeal has nearly bankrupted him.   ``You're the kind of man who was concerned about how much moneyyou had or didn't have?,'' Puccio asked. Boesky replied: ``Lessthan you might think. It has far less, far less consequence thanyou might think.''   Puccio also asked U.S. District Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaumfor permission to see Boesky's 1987 federal tax return, saying hewanted to determine if Boesky took an illegal deduction on the $100million.   At a later conference with attorneys in the judge's chambers,Boesky attorney Charles Davidow said Boesky had deducted $50million of his $100 million penalty on his 1986 personal income taxstatement. Davidow said he did not know whether the deduction waslegal, but he assumed Boesky's tax attorneys or accountants hadreviewed it at the time.   The judge granted Puccio's request. However, she said she wouldallow defense attorneys to discuss the deduction duringcross-examination only in attempting to show that the penaltyagainst Boesky was not as painful or expensive as it appeared.   On Wednesday, Boesky admitted under a heated cross-examinationthat he had lied under oath repeatedly in the past.   ``I regret that I lied. I did not like lying at the time, nordid I like the time when I represented false statements about yourclient,'' Boesky told Puccio.   Mulheren faces 41 counts of securities fraud and other chargesfor allegedly helping Boesky cheat on his taxes and evade federalsecurities laws.   Boesky fingered Mulheren in a 1986 plea bargain under which hepaid $100 million in penalties and served two years of a three-yearprison sentence to settle the largest insider trading case ever.</TEXT></DOC>
