It's &quot;more important than stock selection,&quot; claims Edward Kerschner, chief investment strategist for PaineWebber Inc., echoing a comment made by top research officials at several other firms.    Asset allocation is the art of placing an investor's funds into different types of assets to come up with a strategically balanced portfolio. Some financial advisers slice the pie into many pieces and include real estate, gold or esoteric investments like oil-and-gas partnerships. But brokerage houses usually use just three categories: stocks, bonds and cash. (&quot;Cash,&quot; in this case, means safe investments like Treasury bills or money market funds, not dollars under the mattress.)    Following last fall's stock market crash, asset allocation became a hot topic on Wall Street -- and for good reason. People caught with too much of their money in stocks needed a trip to the financial hospital. Those who had diversified their investment portfolios escaped with cuts and bruises.    How good is the asset-allocation advice doled out by major brokerage houses? To find out, The Wall Street Journal surveyed the advice given last year by the 10 largest brokerage houses, based on the number of registered representatives. Wilshire Associates, a securities-research firm in Santa Monica, Calif., then estimated how investors who followed the suggestions would have fared. The accompanying table shows the results and what each house recommends now.    As it turns out, most of the brokerage houses offered useful allocation advice in 1987. Indeed, six of the 10 beat last year's return on stocks, and all of them bested the annual return on bonds. Still, some did much better than others. Here's a firm-by-firm rundown:   KIDDER PEABODY andamp; CO.: Cash was king for Kidder in 1987. For most of the year, it suggested that investors keep 35% of their funds in cash, the highest level recommended by any of the firms. That caution paid off: Last year, cash (as measured by Treasury bills) outperformed both stocks and bonds on an annual basis. Bonds, overall, were the worst investment, but at no point did Kidder recommend more than a 20% bond position.    As for stocks, Kidder suggested a 45% weighting, which it lowered to 40% in November. The firm's cautious stance &quot;reflected our assessment that the financial markets were likely to face a protracted period of great uncertainty and volatility,&quot; says R. Joseph Fuchs, Kidder's director of research. &quot;We were communicating an overriding concern with capital preservation.&quot;    PAINEWEBBER: &quot;We're the only firm that has a totally objective model as opposed to a committee decision,&quot; says Mr. Kerschner, the company's investment strategist. The model turns on historical data about &quot;risk premiums.&quot; For the past 20 years, Mr. Kerschner says, investors have generally demanded 2.7 percentage points of extra return for investing in stocks, as opposed to bonds, to compensate for the extra risk. When the spread diminishes to less than that, bonds generally look like the better buy, he says. And that's exactly what happened in 1987: As stock prices rose and interest rates climbed, the gap narrowed. Thus, PaineWebber started the year recommending that investors put 47% of their funds into stocks, then progressively lightened that percentage to 6% just before the crash.    DEAN WITTER REYNOLDS INC.: &quot;What we did right was pay attention to the fundamentals, as opposed to the psychology of the moment,&quot; says John Connolly, the firm's chief investment strategist. When 1987 began, Dean Witter recommended a 71% weighting in stocks and, in three cuts, chipped that down to 50%. Still, the final cut came in May, three months before the market peaked. &quot;If there was a fault, it was being a little bit too early,&quot; Mr. Connolly says, &quot;but I guess you can't have it both ways.&quot;    MERRILL LYNCH: &quot;If I was right all the time, I'd be (sailing) my yacht,&quot; says Charles Clough, chief investment strategist for Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. Before the crash, Merrill stepped down its weighting on stocks to 40% from 50%; at the same time, it increased its weighting on bonds to 40%. &quot;I had the timing of the moves right,&quot; says Mr. Clough, &quot;but I should have made&quot; more dramatic changes. -   SHEARSON LEHMAN HUTTON: Investment strategist Michael Sherman says he has two regrets about the advice he gave last year. First, it was &quot;wrongfooted&quot; of him to suggest raising cash levels to 20% as early as he did, in May. Second, he wishes he'd done more to prepare for the crash. Between April and October, Mr. Sherman recommended that investors gradually lower their stock holdings to 50% of their total portfolio, from 65%. Now, of course, he wishes he'd advised them to lower it more. After all, he says, &quot;I was writing articles all summer long about how inflated the (stock) market was.&quot;    Shearson was the only firm to recommend that investors buy gold. But the amount was so small -- just 5% -- that it had a negligible impact on the firm's annual results.    A.G. EDWARDS: The prize for &quot;most cautious&quot; among the 10 firms probably goes to A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons Inc. At the start of last year, the St. Louis-based firm recommended that investors put only 35% of their money in stocks. Before the crash, it lowered that to 30%; after the crash, it lowered the weighting again, to 25%. &quot;We are basically a conservative company,&quot; says chief economist Raymond Worseck. &quot;As the stock market got crazier and crazier, we thought that bonds represented good value.&quot;    SMITH BARNEY: At the start of 1987, John Hoffman, chief investment strategist at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., urged a 30% position in bonds and only a 50% position in stocks. &quot;After two good years in 1985 and 1986, I don't think we anticipated how strong the stock market would be in early 1987,&quot; he says. &quot;We were late in a bull market. . . . We were getting a little nervous at that point.&quot;    Smith Barney raised its stock allocation to 60% in the spring, then ducked back to 50% in September. Naturally, Mr. Hoffman now wishes he'd ducked lower, but he figures no one really foresaw the crash.    THOMSON MCKINNON: The good news is that prior to the crash, Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. told investors to raise their cash position to 25%. The bad news is it suggested the money come out of bonds, not stocks: Throughout most of the year, Thomson recommended a position in equities that hovered around 50%. Early in 1987, Thomson urged a 48% allocation to bonds. That proved another unwise move: the bond market sputtered for much of the year.    DREXEL BURNHAM: The calculations for Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. are based on its advice to institutional clients; the firm doesn't have a blend for retail customers. At its most bullish, Drexel will only recommend an allocation of 60% in stocks; similarly, the highest it will go in bonds is 40%. When it foresees trouble for either market, cash can be substituted for some of the stocks or bonds.    During most of 1987, Drexel recommended a 58% position in stocks and a 25% position in bonds. After the crash it held to the 58% stock weighting but raised the bond component to 32%. According to Abby Joseph Cohen, the firm's chief investment strategist, this post-crash advice has paid off handsomely, even if in the 1987 totals it's largely offset by losses elsewhere.    PRUDENTIAL-BACHE: Throughout 1987, Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. urged an intense commitment to stocks. As the year started, it suggested that aggressive small investors be 95% invested in stocks. That dipped to 85% by mid-year, then rose to 90% before the crash. In October, Pru-Bache ran bullishly right off the cliff.    Alone among the 10 firms, Pru-Bache advised investors to avoid bonds altogether during 1987. Greg Smith, chief investment strategist, says he felt the economy would be stronger than expected and the dollar weak -- both bad for bonds. Thus, some Prudential-Bache followers probably missed the post-crash bond rally.    ---                     Who Has the Best Blend?

For stocks, that meant the gain or loss in the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index with dividends reinvested. For bonds, the yardstick was the Shearson Lehman Hutton index of government and corporate bonds. For cash, it was the return on 13-week Treasury bills.   Wilshire Associates, which performed the calculations, rebalanced the holdings once a month to keep the portfolios in line with the brokerage houses' asset-allocation guidelines. In addition, individual portfolios were rebalanced whenever a house's advice changed.</TEXT></DOC>
