To evaluate the efficiency and investigate the source of lossesan exergy method (as it reveals the efficiency of work transmission throughthe plant) is applied to pinpoint the real losses in the cycle. A comparisonis made between several forms of the cycle, and energy-exergy analysisis carried out by constructing flow charts for the forms having the sameoutput power. Further more analysis is made to the solar system to showthe effect of ambient temperature and mass flow rate of the working fluidon the second law efficiency and exergy losses for a number of components.</TEXT></DOC>
