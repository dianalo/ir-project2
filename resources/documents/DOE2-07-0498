In the optical communication system used under radiationenvironment, an optical fiber highly radiation resistant is required.In the wholly-synthetic pure quartz core fiber prepared by minimizingthe impurities in the clad for its high purity, its radiation resistanceat low temperature is high. Concerning the radiation characteristic atshort wavelengths as the cause for loss increase at long wavelengths,in the {gamma}-ray irradiation experiment with OH and Cl contents inthe core as the parameters, the absorption at short wavelengths due toCl becomes high at low temperature.
