Noauthoritative statistics measure it. Few rules govern it. Itoften defies marketplace logic, featuring billion-dollardeals done not for profit but for murky political reasons.   Despite that, it's clear that desperate times lie aheadfor the industry. The end of the Cold War has unsettled thebusiness, shrinking the industry's customary markets andsending the old players scrambling for new buyers in theThird World.</LP><TEXT>   Next week, experts representing the five permanent membersof the United Nations National Security Council will meet inLondon to see if they can work out a way to control thispotentially destabilizing flow of weaponry, or at least beginto measure the problem. If the five -- the U.S., the SovietUnion, China, the United Kingdom and France -- agree, thenmuch can be done. They control almost 90% of the business,according to a study by the Congressional Research Service.   Even for them, gaining an overall view of the market won'tbe easy. And the opaque nature of the upgrade business addsanother layer of secrecy to the arms-selling business.Anthony H. Cordesman, a military adviser to Sen. John McCain,the Arizona Republican, has struggled for years to reconcilesecret Central Intelligence Agency data with other measuresof the arms business. He has come to believe it's impossible.   &quot;Arms sales is an incredible liars' contest,&quot; says Mr.Cordesman, a former analyst for the Pentagon. Ministries ofdefense habitually understate what they've bought, while thecompanies that sell to them &quot;usually lie about their successin order to push others to buy from them,&quot; he says.   The best available data, an annual report by theCongressional Research Service taken from declassified CIAnumbers, shows that arms sales peaked in 1982, when therewere $61 billion of agreements with developing nations. Lastyear, the figure was just $41 billion, and most experts thinkthe decline will continue.   For the first time since 1983, the U.S. ranks first, aresult largely of emergency sales to Saudi Arabia on the eveof the Gulf War. But, as the congressional report notes, U.S.weapons &quot;are more advanced, complex and costly&quot; than those ofmost other suppliers and, aside from the Saudis, most ThirdWorld clients may not be able to afford them.   The Soviet Union is now No. 2. In its search for cashclients, however, it has shifted away from its traditionalturf, which included Eastern Europe, Cuba and Africa. &quot;Thisis a tough market for the U.S.S.R., too,&quot; says G. Buyev, whodirects helicopter sales for the Soviet firm V/O Aviaexport.   In Eastern Europe, the Soviets are having to compete withformer customers, who are unloading Soviet helicopters atbelow cost. In the new markets, Mr. Buyev says he makesbarter deals, trading helicopters for textiles, knitwear andfood. One favorite barter customer is India.   What does V/O Aviaexport do with knitwear? &quot;We sell it atlow prices to our employees. You have to understand, oureconomy is in total chaos,&quot; he says.   A decade of expansion has lifted China to third placeamong arms sellers. Some of that success is the result ofteams of arms sellers hawking the Chinese versions of Sovietequipment at cheap &quot;friendship prices.&quot; But according to U.S.officials, buyers are most interested in China's highesttechnology, such as its new family of intermediate-rangemissiles, which, to the chagrin of Israel and India, arebeing sold to Syria and Pakistan.   Finally, some new sellers have emerged to further muddythe picture, especially in the Middle and Far East. One ofthem is North Korea, which offers Soviet tanks and missilesat cut-rate prices. U.S. officials say North Korea hasdeveloped a robust marketing system, even brokering Westernarms when Soviet equipment won't do.</TEXT></DOC>
