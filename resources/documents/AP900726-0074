The relief effort has also been hampered by logistical problemsand quarreling over supplies, said Ramos, who is chairman of theNational Disaster Coordinating Council.   ``The uneven distribution of goods comes from competition at thecommunity level as to who should get the relief goods,'' he said.``Sometimes the relief goods intended ... to reach a certain familydoes not get to that family because of some misdelivery along theway.''   Ramos said he had ordered an investigation of why some supplieshad failed to reach their destination. The defense chief also saidrelief efforts were focusing on northern towns accessible only byhelicopter because of landslides.   According to the latest figures, the earthquake left at least1,653 people dead, more than 1,000 missing and presumed dead, morethan 3,000 seriously injured and nearly 90,000 homeless.   Officials estimated today that property damage totaled $903million, an amount that was expected to increase. The quake, whichmeasured 7.7 on the Richter scale, was the strongest to strike thePhilippines in 14 years.
