Britain said about 350 Vietnamese boat people who expressed adesire to return home will be sent back in a phased program thatwill start immediately.   The agreement was announced at the end of a second round oftalks between a joint British-Hong Kong delegation and a Vietnamesedelegation led by the assistant foreign minister, Vu Khoan.   The accord says both sides accept ``the need for comprehensivearrangements'' for Vietnamese boat people who arrived in Hong Kongafter June 16, when the British colony moved to curb a steep risein refugees by ending its open door policy.   A Foreign Office spokesman, who by custom was not identified,said the 9,500 Vietnamese refugees in question are classified asillegal immigrants and will remain in detention centers pendingoutcome of further talks with Vietnam.   Forcible repatriation of refugees who do not want to return homehas not been discussed with the Vietnamese, he said, adding:   ``We will concentrate on the first 350. We hope others will comeforward and realize that their future is in Vietnam.''   Vu said the returning refugees would be received in a``humanitarian way.''   Under Hong Kong policy now in effect, Vietnamese who cannotprove they are fleeing political persecution are labeled illegalimmigrants subject to repatriation. Hong Kong holds that most areactually economic migrants.   The total number of Vietnamese boat people now in camps there is25,000.   Two weeks ago, Hong Kong began broadcasts aiming at Vietnamexplaining the new tough policy in a move to discourage Vietnamesefrom heading there.   The delegations also called on other countries to increase theirefforts to accept Vietnamese eligible for resettlement from HongKong.   They invited the U.N. High Commission for Refugees to take partin putting into effect the accord to repatriate those Vietnamesewho want to return home.</TEXT></DOC>
