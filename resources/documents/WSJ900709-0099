Although sentiment hasn't turned sour, the mood is alreadya bit lethargic, and buying interest will become increasinglyselective, analysts predict. The market's leading industrialsare expected to lag behind the market, whiletelecommunications, cement, food and selected textile stockswill still be attractive, they added.</LP><TEXT>   Analysts predict the general MIB index will maintainitself above 1060 through the July-September period. Thiswould be 6% above its level at the beginning of the year, butdown about four percentage points from its 1990 high of 1113reached on June 14. The MIB closed at 1065 Friday after aweak session.   The strong inflow of foreign buying that lifted the indexduring May and June could be diverted to other Europeanmarkets over the summer as international investors look forgreener pastures, the analysts said.   &quot;International money follows performance, and we may seeit shifting from Italy to France, which has been quietlately, or back to Germany if the market perceives a unifiedGerman market will pose no threat to inflation,&quot; said AlbertAlonzo, Italian market analyst with Barclays de Zoete Wedd inLondon.   A major factor spooking foreign buyers recently is thesudden escalation of labor unrest just as Italy takes on itsrole as president of the European Community. Governmentattempts to head off a general strike by Italy's threeleading unions set for Wednesday have been unsuccessful sofar. The conflict is expected to test a delicate politicalbalance in Italy's governing coalition headed by veteranChristian Democrat Giulio Andreotti.   &quot;We're going to see relatively slower progress over thethird quarter largely because the conflict betweenConfindustria (Italy's manufacturers' association) and theunions will probably not be resolved until the end of thequarter at the earliest,&quot; Mr. Alonzo said.   Confindustria wants to abolish the &quot;scala mobile&quot;automatic wage index by next year and is urging that wageincreases be linked to performance instead of the current&quot;escalator,&quot; which is tied to inflation.   Until the social tensions are resolved, the cost of laborremains a wild card in Italy's macroeconomic picture, withmajor implications for inflation and interest rates. Althoughinflation is on a downtrend, &quot;it still hasn't been beaten,&quot;Mr. Alonzo asserted.   Italy's cost of living rose 5.6% in June from a yearearlier, down from 5.7% in May, and the Bank of Italypredicted last week that it will fall to around 5% by the endof the year if wage costs can be kept under control.   Mutual funds are heavily invested in blue chips Fiat andGenerali, two shares that drive the Milan market. Together,they represent some 20% of the Milan market's totalcapitalization.   Analysts said the telecommunications sector is stillhitting strong notes and shows little sign of abating.   &quot;There's nothing to cloud the horizon&quot; ontelecommunications shares, said Suzanne Miller, sectoranalyst for Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London. &quot;You keepexpecting some sort of short-term consolidation, but it nevermaterializes.&quot;   ---   Friday's Market Activity                                                                                                          Tokyo stocks finished higher on thin volume Friday, withinterest flocking instead to the secondary markets,particularly the Tokyo Stock Exchange Second Section.

London share prices closed on their intraday highs Friday,buoyed by a firm performance on Wall Street and a broad-basedprogram trade by an unidentified securities firm.   Sentiment remains nervous on the almost daily release ofprofit downgradings and Thursday's comment by the U.K.Chancellor of the Exchequer that interest rates would have toremain high because of the excessive amount of credit in theeconomy.   Friday, the end of the current two-week trading account,saw brisk volume, with 739.8 million shares traded comparedwith 386.8 million Thursday.
