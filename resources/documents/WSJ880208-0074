As a result, insurers are facing more political heat.    New Jersey drivers, already paying the highest average premiums, face a new $44 to $73 per-car surcharge and probably higher basic rates. Meanwhile, insurance companies fear they will be required by the state to help bail out the deficit-ridden pool that insures high-risk drivers.    In California, annual auto-insurance charges that can top $2,500 in central Los Angeles have sparked a public outcry and several petitions to put rate-cutting measures on the November ballot. &quot;You can pay more for your auto insurance than for your car,&quot; complains Harvey Rosenfield of Access to Justice, a Los Angeles-based consumer group pushing a measure that would immediately cut auto rates by 20%.    The average charges nationwide have risen faster than overall inflation for six years in a row. The auto-insurance component of the Consumer Price Index climbed 8.3% last year, more than twice the 3.7% increase in the overall index.    &quot;People are outraged about their auto-insurance premiums because everybody drives, everybody needs auto insurance,&quot; says Jay Angoff, counsel for the National Insurance Consumer Organization, based in Alexandria, Va.    Predictably, insurance companies, consumer advocates, lawyers and others disagree about what should be done about the climbing rates -- and about why they are so high in the first place. Those disagreements are confounding politicians in several states, including New Jersey, Massachusetts, California and Pennsylvania, as they take up auto-insurance issues in their current legislative sessions.    Insurers say recent rises in premiums are principally attributable to steep increases in the costs of medical care and auto repair. But some consumer groups suggest that the resulting squeeze on auto-insurance profits may not be as severe as the industry suggests.    The Insurance Information Institute, the property-casualty industry's public-relations arm, points to data from independent data-gatherer A.M. Best Co. showing that the private-passenger auto line lost about a penny for each $1 in premiums last year. That followed such losses of two cents in 1986 and four cents in 1985.    But consumer activists note that many industry numbers, including Best's, do not include large capital gains from investments that have helped the property-casualty industry post record net incomes over the past few years.    State regulators and legislators must address a number of sticky issues as they try to bring auto rates under control. Among them: Should states restrict consumers' ability to file some lawsuits, as a way to trim insurers' legal expenses and settlements? Should rural residents, who always pay lower rates than city drivers, be charged higher rates, to keep inner-city coverage affordable? And should auto rates be determined by the marketplace or be more tightly regulated by states?    According to a tally being published today by Best, New Jersey drivers, as they had in many recent years, paid the highest average auto premiums in the nation in 1986, the most recent year for which figures are available. Best found that the highest-cost states are typically the most densely populated ones, as accidents are more common and costs generally higher.    (Best concedes that, in states where auto insurance isn't required or where there are many illegally uninsured drivers, average premiums may be higher than indicated in the accompanying table. But the Best tally is widely used and generally considered the most comprehensive available.)    Auto insurers say two states with the highest premiums -- New Jersey and Massachusetts -- are far and away the least profitable for the industry. They say state regulators, who strongly control the rates, have not granted insurers adequate prices.    One of the biggest issues in New Jersey and Massachusetts are the provisions of their no-fault insurance systems. Many states have no-fault laws, designed to quickly compensate accident victims without their having to go to court. But insurers say the laws in New Jersey and Massachusetts provide very generous compensation -- particularly New Jersey's unlimited payments for medical care -- without enough offsetting restrictions on the ability of victims to seek additional redress in the courts. Insurers want more restrictions, which attorneys and some consumer groups adamantly oppose.    As a result, Fireman's Fund Corp., Kemper Group and other insurers are trying in the face of regulators' opposition to exit the Massachusetts market. In New Jersey, Aetna Life andamp; Casualty Co. dropped about 40% of its agents. Reluctant insurers have dispatched half of New Jersey's drivers to the state-run pool, where the state-set rates have contributed to a deficit said to be approaching $2 billion.    Meanwhile, insurers have nightmares about California, which accounts for 15% of their business. They fear the agitation about high rates in Los Angeles could result in forced price cuts and the end of a state system that has let the insurers charge whatever they wish. &quot;We don't want to see (California) fall into the Massachusetts or New Jersey trap&quot; of state-set rates, says George M. Reider, an Aetna vice president.    The Insurance Information Institute will spend more than $1 million this year on a public-relations campaign related to auto insurance, particularly addressing seven insurance measures proposed for the California ballot.    One issue is the degree to which auto-insurance rates should vary by where a person lives. &quot;The losses are high in Los Angeles, so the rates should be high,&quot; says Sean Mooney, chief economist of the institute. A few of the proposed measures would restrict or eliminate insurers' ability to consider territory in setting rates, potentially forcing rural and suburban drivers to subsidize city drivers.    New Jersey, Massachusetts and Michigan currently restrict price differentials between big cities and other areas, says attorney Judith Mintel of State Farm Insurance Cos. Some consumer groups say that's desirable. They assert that many inner-city residents in places like Los Angeles and Philadelphia simply cannot afford the auto coverage they are required by law to have.    Indeed, Mr. Rosenfield, the Los Angeles activist, says some traffic accidents there are followed by the rapid departure of everyone involved: &quot;Nobody wants to stay, because nobody is insured.&quot;    ---             Average Auto-Insurance Costs by State    1986 private-passenger auto-insurance premiums per registered car    TOP TEN    New Jersey                                $603.55    Alaska                                     602.45    California                                 588.20    Massachusetts                              555.55    Arizona                                    553.84    Nevada                                     549.55    New York                                   522.06    Louisiana                                  514.97    Pennsylvania                               512.09    Maryland                                   506.34    BOTTOM TEN    Maine                                     $332.83*    New Hampshire                              330.47*    Ohio                                       327.01    Nebraska                                   323.98*    North Dakota                               307.13    Mississippi                                297.25*    Tennessee                                  292.49*    Alabama                                    278.46*    South Dakota                               255.77*    Iowa                                       243.95* -    *State does not mandate auto coverage    The average payment by insurance holders was probably higher than indicated.
