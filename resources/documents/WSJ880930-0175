Revised plans for the $400 million project now include the possibility of signing up Nissho Iwai Corp., one of Japan's biggest trading companies, as a partner.    That arrangement could bring much-needed financial support, as Nissho Iwai hopes to export more than half the production to Japan as liquefied natural gas. But the plan could touch on trade-sensitive nerves in the U.S., which had an offer of Alaskan LNG rejected by Japan.    Arco and China National Offshore Oil Corp. signed a contract in September 1985 to develop the Yinggehai gas field, which Arco had discovered off the southern tip of Hainan island two years earlier. But falling oil prices forced the two sides to renegotiate the agreement in 1986.    The Chinese offered a reduced price for the gas but Arco wouldn't accept it. Nor could China work out a plan to generate foreign exchange needed to pay for the gas and imported production equipment. Talks were suspended.    A breakthrough came this month. Tang Zhenghua, vice general manager of China National, concluded a draft agreement with Arco officials at the U.S. firm's Los Angeles headquarters. Neither side will discuss details, but Zhang Mingzhi, China National's planning manager, says &quot;both sides compromised on the price issue.&quot;    The two sides expect to sign a new contract in Beijing in November to develop the gas field.    It isn't clear what motivated Arco to make price concessions at this stage. But the company, which declined to explain its strategy, already has spent more than $100 million on exploration alone. According to Wang Yan, general manager of Nanhai West Oil Corp., a China National unit, &quot;Arco may have the long-term China market in mind.&quot;    The participation of Nissho Iwai, one of Japan's largest general trading companies, may solve the project's foreign-exchange problem. China's currency, the renminbi, isn't convertible and thus the project needs to sell gas to foreign users for foreign exchange to pay for imported production equipment.    In July, Arco, China National and Nissho Iwai signed an agreement to study the feasibility of setting up a liquefaction plant to produce LNG. While Nissho Iwai isn't committed to the project, a source close to the Japanese side said the company is &quot;optimistic&quot; it will go forward. The feasibility study is to be completed by April 1989.    Nissho Iwai, which declined to discuss the project, has already begun lining up Japanese buyers, including utilities and fertilizer companies. &quot;We're all doing our best to make the LNG plan succeed,&quot; Mr. Zhang says.    Whether it does or not, that aspect of the gas-field project is likely to spark controversy. When Japan rejected the U.S. proposal to import large quantities of LNG from Alaska, it claimed that the Japanese market was saturated. Sources close to the project foresee the possibility of trade friction with the U.S. over the matter.    But Japan's appetite for LNG is increasing, sources close to the project say. Since the Chernobyl nuclear accident in April 1986, opposition in Japan to nuclear power has increased. LNG is a relatively clean, less-objectionable energy source.    Under current plans, the LNG project would use between 50% and 60% of the gas field's anticipated annual production of 3.25 billion cubic meters. Nissho Iwai estimates it can export a million tons of LNG a year to Japan. LNG production from the gas field, whose reserves are thought to exceed 90 billion cubic meters, would begin in 1994 if the current plans go forward.    The consortium developing the gas includes China National, with a 51% interest; Arco with 34%; and Santa Fe International Corp., a U.S.-based unit of Kuwait Petroleum Corp., with 15%. Plans call for construction of an offshore platform, a 100-kilometer subsea pipeline to Hainan, and possibly a 1,050-kilometer pipeline to Canton.    Sources close to the project estimate the total cost of the current phase at about $400 million. That doesn't include the LNG project, however, which could require an additional investment of $400 million, the sources say. </TEXT></DOC>
