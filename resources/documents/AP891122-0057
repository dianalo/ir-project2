(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A college professor from New Mexico whowas trapped in a hotel by a Salvadoran rebel attack said hebarricaded his room with mattresses as a precaution against straybullets.   Ron Blood, a professor of education administration at theUniversity of New Mexico, described in a telephone interview fromEl Salvador on Tuesday how government troops landed on the roof ofthe El Salvador Sheraton and led him and others to safety throughheavy fighting.   ``I've been in tough spots before but never like that,'' Bloodsaid.   Blood, 57, was in the capital for work with a university officethat works with the U.S. Agency for International Development. Hewas staying in a section of the luxury hotel separate fromfive-story annex where rebels temporarily trapped dozens offoreigners.   Early today, the only foreigners remaining in the hotel annexoccupied by the rebels were eight armed U.S. Army Green Berets whoapparently were waiting for the insurgents to slip away fromencircling Salvadoran government troops under cover of darkness.   ``The battle just closed in around the hotel, and it becameapparent the army was not going to be able to clear it,'' he said.   Blood barricaded himself in his room, covering his windows withmattresses and hiding in his bathtub because he had been told thatwas the safest place.   He got through to the U.S. embassy on a walkie-talkie systemwhich the university's San Salvador office shares with AID.   ``They told us the guerrillas had entered the hotel. After thatI stopped using the radio because it beeps and people with radiosare likely targets.   ``The battle just went on and on. You could hear the glassbreaking,'' he said.   By afternoon, Salvadoran government troops he likened tocommandos landed on the roof of the Sheraton, he said.   ``They entered from above and helped clear the building. ...They took us down through the building and out to a little armoredvehicle, called a tanqueta, or little tank,'' Blood said. ``Thehotel was still under very heavy fire.''   In contrast, a Portland, Ore., couple who were trapped in thehotel for 14 hours said they didn't feel threatened.   Larry Miller and his wife Charlotte Miller, both 71, were freedunharmed along with other foreigners, said their son, Lyman Millerof Portland. He spoke with his parents by telephone Tuesday evening.   ``They were well treated, they never had a gun pointed at themdirectly or were threatened in any way and it was clear theguerrillas objective was never to harm them in any way,'' Millersaid.   The Millers had been in El Salvador since Oct. 15 with theInternational Executive Service Corps, an agency that sends retiredU.S. business executives to advise their counterparts in developingnations. Miller went to work with an asphalt manufacturing company.   Blood, director of the university's Office of InternationalTechnical Cooperation, was in El Salvador to prepare for theplanned closing of the university's education office next month.The office, which is finishing contract work for AID, will closetoday because of the fighting, Blood said.</TEXT></DOC>
