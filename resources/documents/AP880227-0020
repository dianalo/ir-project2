The State Department official, who spoke on condition ofanonymity, said Friday the proposal is designed to get a speedyvote on the resolution while meeting the Kremlin's stated desirefor another round of diplomacy aimed at winning a cease-fire in theIran-Iraq war.   The official said U.S. officials proposed Thursday to Sovietrepresentatives at the United Nations that the United States wouldbe willing to discuss delaying implementation of an embargo from 30to 60 days.   The United States has been pushing the Soviets to agree to theembargo but the Soviets have been reluctant to implement onewithout another diplomatic attempt by U.N. Secretary-General JavierPerez de Cuellar to get Iran to agree to a cease-fire in itsseven-year war with Iraq.   The Soviet position has been that any embargo should immediatelyfollow passage of an embargo resolution by the U.N. SecurityCouncil, and therefore such a vote should be delayed to allow timefor more diplomatic efforts.   Meanwhile, the Minneapolis Star andamp; Tribune in today's editionsquoted administration officials who said the United States also iswilling to discuss with the Soviets the creation of a U.N. fleet tostop and search ships suspected of carrying arms to Iran.   The officials, who were not identified by the newspaper, saidthe U.N. fleet would not be similar to a Soviet proposal that U.S.,French, British and other Western naval forces in the Persian Gulfbe put under the U.N. flag and command.   Rather, the arms-monitoring fleet under the U.S. proposal wouldbe made up of ships from neutral countries and would interceptfreighters at the mouth of the Gulf as they headed for the Iranianport of Bandar Abbas, the newspaper said.   The State Department official told The Associated Press that theU.S. position all along has been to discuss proposals that might beused to implement the embargo after passage of the U.N. resolution.   The United States has not yet made a specific proposal to theSoviets about how the embargo would be enforced, the official said.   The Security Council adopted a resolution July 20 demanding animmediate cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war, troop withdrawal,prisoner exchange and enforcement steps if either party did notcomply.   Only Iraq has agreed to the cease-fire. An attempt by thesecretary-general to bring both sides to agreement foundered inSeptember.   Any of the five permanent members of the Security Council _ theUnited States, the Soviet Union, Great Britain, France and China _could veto an embargo resolution.   The Soviet Union and other nations seeking better relations withIran have been reluctant to push for punitive enforcement.   Earlier this month, U.S. officials said that China, which theysaid sold $1 billion worth of arms to Iran last year, is notexpected to block an embargo.</TEXT></DOC>
