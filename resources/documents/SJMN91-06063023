How much do you have to sock awayeach month and at what interest rate?  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Computing  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  FINANCE10 PROGRAM PUTS YOU AHEAD OF THE NUMBERS  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Software  </MEMO><TEXT>     Or you're looking at one mortgage loan of 10.9 percent for 25 years andanother of 13 percent for 20 years. Which is the better deal?;    I'm one ofthose who give daily thanks that long division without a calculator is just amemory, but answers to those questions took less than 30 seconds. (If you're45 and expect to live to be 85, better pump about $2,500 a year at 8 percentinterest into your IRA. Over term, the 10.9 percent mortgage will wind upcosting you more than $10,000 above the 13 percent mortgage.);    That suddentransplant of financial smarts comes courtesy of Finance10. The package of 10financial programs from Financial Software Co. of Los Angeles is forInternational Business Machines Corp. Personal Computers and compatiblesrunning DOS 3.0 or later.;    Installation is smooth and easy, and the programcan run either as a stand-alone application or as a pop-up. The first thingthat pops up to a reviewer is the price, $69.95, which is on the high side.But that's the only negative, and the price will probably drop if the packageis picked up by mail-order and discount houses.;    The user interface isexcellent, meaning the software has manners. Commands are the same through all10 applications, and all applications assume the user knows only enough tofill in the blanks -- on the money for this user at least.;    The softwarecomes with 3 1/2- and 5 1/4-inch disks and no copy protection. The manual isclear and is enriched by the cartoons of Rich Tennant.;    Finance10 seems tohave two markets, the certified public accountant types who want to slamthrough common calculations quickly, and those of us who think &quot;standarddeviation&quot; means a level of weirdness no greater than average.;   Particularly useful for the average consumer is the lease-or-buy analysis andthe personal financial statement modules. A walk through automobile ads usingthe lease-or-buy module will help make sense of the financial fine print foundat the bottom of the display ads. And the personal financial statement willgive you a clear and concise picture of how good (or bad) your financialhealth is.;    For more information on Finance10, write Financial SoftwareCo., P.O.
