The diluted final report minimized EPA's troubles in monitoringleakage from hazardous waste dumps, said Richard L. Hembra,director of the environmental protection section of the GeneralAccounting Office. GAO is an investigating arm of Congress.   A separate ``Superfund'' program is for cleanup of abandoneddisposal sites, sometimes in cases where responsible parties cannotbe located. Hembra said the problem involving leaks from hazardouswaste dumps into groundwater supplies ``could be as big'' as thewaste problem which Superfund handles.   In testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee'sinvestigations subcommittee, Hembra and Kathie A. Stein, anattorney with the Environmental Defense Fund, a private,pro-environmental advocacy group, criticized changes made by EPAofficials in the draft report.   Hembra said an accurate picture of the groundwater monitoringand protection program is crucial because ``over 70 percent of thefacilities are leaking'' and ``about one-half the nation'spopulation depends on groundwater for drinking water.''   Hazardous waste disposal facilities are licensed to operate byEPA under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. That lawcontrols operation and closure of the sites and requires operatorsto clean up spills at their expense.   EPA issued its final report last October on groundwatermonitoring at 58 of the nation's 1,447 hazardous waste disposalfacilities studied by its own task force. The GAO studied 50 sites.   A comparison of the October report and the staff task forcedraft in September 1987 showed that some of the hardest-hittingstaff criticism of the enforcement program was deleted. Otherconclusions were softened.   Hembra said while ``a lot of what you see in the way of changeswas moving away from emotion-laden language,'' other deletionspresented ``a pretty damning picture of the program.''   Ms. Stein said ``some of the best technical talent at EPAsounded an alert'' about the monitoring program, but ``it doesn'tseem like EPA answered the call.''   ``Somewhere, as it moves up through the agency, the findingsseem to disappear,'' said Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore. ``The finalversion of the task force report deleted the finding that mostfacilities are leaking.''   One deletion was a task force conclusion that enforcement ofgroundwater monitoring was so poor that EPA and state officials``potentially compromise the level of protection provided to thepublic and the environment.''   Jonathan Z. Cannon, acting assistant EPA administrator for solidwaste and emergency response, said officials who have left theagency were responsible for the changes. He asked the committee torecognize that new officials are now in charge of the monitoringprogram. He said EPA has ``made progress'' but has ``a long way togo.''   The September 1987 staff report said each of the facilities itinvestigated had ``significant deficiencies with their ...detection monitoring systems.'' That conclusion was omitted fromthe final report.   The earlier report said the task force found ``that while mostfacilities were found to have groundwater contamination, very fewhave any active groundwater cleanup program in progress and none ofthese programs meet (the law's) standards.''   The final report left out that ``most facilities'' contaminatednearby groundwater and said: ``With respect to corrective action,the task force found that of those facilities that had groundwatercontamination, few had active groundwater cleanup programs inprogress.''   A staff report conclusion, deleted in the final version, saidEPA enforcement personnel and managers ``do not elicit, cannotunderstand, or sometimes do not heed, recommendations fromqualified technical personnel, which would improve the level ofcompliance and quality of actions.''   The draft said that ``none'' of the facilities investigated hascharacterized the extent of its contamination as required by law.The final version deleted the ``none,'' and said, ``The task forcefound ... that inadequate groundwater monitoring efforts at manysites often resulted in unsatisfactory ..~hy</TEXT><NOTE>Ots.''</NOTE></DOC>
