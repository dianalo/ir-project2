Ask the winners andlosers, and they'll admit these were all important factors intheir races. Nevertheless, there's a powerful economicmessage that's in danger of getting lost in the shuffle.   According to official exit polls, by nearly two-to-one,Democratic voters in Michigan Tuesday said providingincentives for economic growth, not a middle-class tax cut,should be a higher priority. And that's just among Democrats.</LP><TEXT>   Unfortunately, a lot of congressional Democrats need toget their hearing checked. Congress is striking zero. Zero --at midnight, that's how many days will remain in PresidentBush's challenge to Congress for action on a responsibleeconomic growth package. Zero is what the Democrat-controlledCongress will have to show for its efforts. And zero is whatthe American people have every right to call a Congress thathas put the political goals of the Democratic majority abovethose of the nation.   The American people don't care who's up and who's downpolitically. They have no interest in the ongoing winterOlympics on Capitol Hill where the world-class game ofpolitics-as-usual has once again earned no medals forachievement or courage.   I would be the first to admit that none of the short-termeconomic growth plans is going to make the economy rocket outof the blocks. I would also be the first to admit that, likeit or not, partisan politics is a fact of life in Washington.But there are times when we should be able to take somepositive action, to do it without raising taxes, and to do itwithin a reasonable period of time -- especially when youconsider all the encouraging signs from many sectors of theeconomy. It appears there is a recovery getting underway --slowly yes, too slowly for many, and still a long way to go.But there are solid indications of a pick-up in real estate,construction, factory output, the lowest trade deficit innearly a decade and an inflation rate that remains undercontrol.   That's why President Bush was right to stay away from taxincreases, and to stay on the path of targeted, common-sensegrowth incentives.   With his March 20 deadline for action, President Bush madea reasonable request -- and Congress is flunking the test.Instead of getting timely action, the American people weretreated to the Democrats' cynical class warfare rhetoric:Republicans are &quot;protecting the rich,&quot; the president of theUnited States just doesn't care about domestic issues, andthat Democrats are the good guys, ready to soak the rich,sock it to business and save the middle class. Coming fromthe party that just about taxed the middle class out ofexistence and fought Ronald Reagan's tax cuts every step ofthe way, it all sounds more than a little hokey.   The good news is, the American people are too smart tofall for gimmicks. A lot of congressional Democrats didn'tfall for them, either -- so many, in fact that despite bigmajorities in both houses, the Democrats' own tax planspassed by anemic margins of 11 votes in the House and threevotes in the Senate.   What were the Democrats afraid of? Perhaps they fearedthat they might look &quot;weak&quot; meeting a deadline. Perhaps theyfeared the president's plan might actually help improve theeconomy, save jobs and help businesses up and down MainStreet, and that the president might even get some of thecredit. If you ask me, the Democrats had a chance to share inthe credit -- they could have been part of the solution byjoining with the president. Regrettably, Congress chose to bepart of the problem.   Oh, the Democrats were very accommodating, they will tellyou, willing to include &quot;modifications&quot; of the president'sgrowth initiatives in their proposal. Their idea of growthwas to deny benefits to more than 80% of first-timehomebuyers by limiting the $5,000 homebuyer tax credit to thepurchase of new homes only, and to sock small businesses witha big tax increase, taking 89% of their bill's revenue fromunincorporated business income, despite the fact that smallbusinesses create 60% to 80% of all new jobs every year.Let's face it, the Democrats held any solid growth incentiveshostage to a tax increase -- no tax increase, no growth billwas their bottom line.   The last time I checked, the Democrats had their way at1990's so-called Budget Summit, winning tax hikes on workingand earning America, including the misguided luxury tax,which promised to squeeze an avalanche of greenbacks from therich, but instead buried many middle-class workers in pinkslips. Ask the folks building and selling boats, cars,planes, furs and jewelry on the Democrats tax hit list, andthey will tell you their jobs are necessities, not&quot;luxuries.&quot;   These days, you don't hear the Democrats brag much abouttheir Budget Summit &quot;achievements.&quot; In fact, many aredemanding we tear down the &quot;fire wall&quot; of protection againstdeficit spending.   In his inaugural address, President Bush said he didn'tcome to Washington to bicker with Congress. Well, the zeroCongress hasn't lived up to its end of the bargain. So don'tbe surprised if one of this year's big campaign issues isn'twho's protecting the so-called rich, but who's protecting thestatus quo. I challenge my colleagues -- Republicans andDemocrats -- to look at the polls, listen to the people, andlearn from this week's votes: the American people are tiredof politics-as-usual on Capitol Hill. American taxpayers arepaying us to create jobs, not create excuses. It's time toput America first, America second, and politics last -- for achange.   In their effort to embarrass the president, the Democraticmajority has embarrassed no one but itself. For the no-showperformance on economic growth, the president and theAmerican people have no one to blame but the folks inhabitingground zero.   ---   Sen.
