A 40-page platform waved at a news conference by VishwanathPratap Singh, Gandhi's chief rival and a senior leader of theNational Front coalition, offers few radical departures fromIndia's current stated policies.   In many respects, it recalls pledges Gandhi made five years agowhen his Congress Party was re-elected in a landslide after theassassination of his mother, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.   Elections scheduled for Nov. 22, 24 and 26 will choose a newlower house of Parliament, which holds the political power in India.   The opposition platform reserved its sharpest barbs forcorruption, the rallying cry of Singh's campaign to lead the 880million people of the world's most populous democracy.   Singh, a 58-year-old former Congress Party member and Gandhially, echoed his platform's call for full investigation of theBofors arms scandal. The Swedish manufacturer is accused of payingup to $50 million in kickbacks to clinch a $1.4 billion contractwith the Gandhi government.   ``The funds will be restored to the nation and the guiltypunished,'' he declared at the news conference, and pledged torestore India's ``national dignity.''   When the Bofors contract was signed in 1986, Singh was Gandhi'sdefense minister. He later resigned because of what he calledofficial reluctance to investigate newspaper allegations thatpowerful Indians took payoffs.   Gandhi repeatedly has denied profiting from the deal personallyor that Indians received payoffs or commissions, but theallegations have dogged him for 2{ years.   The opposition alliance seeks a broad base ranging fromcommunists to right-wing Hindu religious groups. Singh, presidentof the People's Party and a secular centrist, has the task ofmaintaining unity in such a coalition.   No reliable poll has been taken in two months, but the consensusof analysts and observers is that Gandhi and the Congress Partyface a tough challenge if the opposition hangs together.   In its manifesto, the National Front also says it willstreamline a labyrinthine bureaucracy that predates independencefrom Britain in 1947.   It pledges to establish a national security council under theprime minister to ``help evolve a consensus on our foreign anddefense policies,'' which the opposition claims are ``pursued in anirrational and arbitrary manner by the present government.''   India's armed forces number 1.4 million, fourth largest in theworld after the superpowers and China. It has tested nucleardevices, has an expanding deep-water navy and is one of only sevennations with demonstrated ability to develop and fireintermediate-range ballistic missiles.   Singh's opposition promised to ``be convincinglypeace-oriented'' and take ``a total view of defense rather than afractured service-by-service approach, which is the case atpresent.''   Foreign policy essentials are the same as Gandhi's. Theopposition platform cited the importance of remaining non-alignedand strenghtening friendly relations with both the Soviet Union andUnited States.</TEXT></DOC>
