The commission's announcement was accompanied by a joint statement by Democratic Party Chairman Paul Kirk and Republican Party Chairman Frank Fahrenkopf calling the plan &quot;the most attractive debate proposal,&quot; but recognizing that &quot;final decisions regarding debates lie with the candidates.&quot;    Vice President George Bush, who this week clinched the GOP presidential nomination, has said he expects to debate the Democratic nominee but doesn't feel bound by the recommendations of the commission. He said he will appoint his own representative to negotiate debate terms with the Democratic nominee.    Both Michael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson have said that, if nominated, they would adhere to the commission's recommendations.    The commission's proposal calls for debates to be held Sept. 14 in Annapolis, Md.; Sept. 25 at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C.; Oct. 11 in Omaha, Neb., and Oct. 27 in Pittsburgh.    Edward Fouhy, a former executive producer of NBC News and a fellow at Harvard University's Institute of Politics, will be executive producer of the debates. </TEXT></DOC>
