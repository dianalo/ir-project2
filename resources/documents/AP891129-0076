(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Searchers today found the bodies of twodogs that had been on a twin-engine plane missing off Rhode Islandbut saw no sign of wreckage or the eight people aboard, authoritiessaid.   Authorities held out hope of finding survivors from the NewEngland Airlines plane that vanished Tuesday night on a 17-mileflight from Block Island State Airport to Westerly.   Searchers on land and in boats reported finding various debris,including a radio headset, a shoe, a life jacket, a fireextinguisher and a box of freight believed to have been aboard theplane.   ``There's always a chance. That's why we're still looking,''said Coast Guard Petty Officer David Brear.   The dogs were found in Block Island Sound, about two milesnorthwest of the island, where two Coast Guard cutters and a dozensmaller boats were searching in water about 100 feet deep and ascold as 45 degrees overnight.   The dogs belonged to passenger Judy Johnson, a New Jersey womanwho had a summer home on the island, said a friend, BarbaraHeineman, who came to the Westerly airport to await further word.   The flight left at 6:20 p.m. and should have taken no more than15 minutes, authorities said. The British Norman Islander aircrafthad about two hours of fuel, airline controller Dean Martin said.   There was no radio contact with pilot John Beck Jr. aftertakeoff, Martin said. The airports involved do not have controltowers, and Beck, a former Naval aviator with about 10 years ofexperience on the Block Island route, would have navigatedvisually, the airline said.   ``We're all just worried sick,'' said Helen Scraug, a bartenderon Block Island. ``We're praying for everybody on that plane.''   Peter Wood, publisher of the Block Island Times newspaper, saidhis wife, Shirley, a real estate agent, was aboard on her way to areal estate class on the mainland.   Others aboard included two construction workers and a man whoworked at a restaurant on the island, New Shoreham police Sgt.William McCombe said.</TEXT></DOC>
