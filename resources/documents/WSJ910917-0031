Lawler's Aug. 29 Counterpoint, &quot;AnIssue this Paper Can't Sidestep&quot; (op-ed page): It is just aswell the Journal has restrained itself on the topic ofabortion. Most of the names in the masthed on the editorialpage are male.   While it's true that some women may have abortionsirresponsibly, it is also true that many men have sex andchildren irresponsibly; that all children who are born areborn of women; that most children are mostly cared for bywomen; that most poor people in the world are women and theirchildren.</LP><TEXT>   Any notions on what the &quot;quickening&quot; of life means, or onthe distinction between physical and spiritual life, aremetaphysical, therefore belonging in the realm of privatereligious beliefs, however ill-defined that may be.Separation of church and state keeps this in the privaterealm.   As legislators, moralists and scientists, men haveappropriated as much as possible the authority to kill, andnow with test tubes and other technology they are making asort of Frankenstein-like attempt at creating life andfending off &quot;natural&quot; deaths. They have always madedistinctions in kinds of killing, legal and illegal, takingmotivation and political ends into account. Very few peopletruly believe that all killing is always wrong, including theanti-abortionists. Who gets to decide which killing is rightor wrong? Those who have the power, mostly men.   The powers of life and death should not be only in malehands. Men have been able to deal with the moral ambiguitiesof war, capital punishment, murder and manslaughter for along time. Adult women can make their own decisions aboutlife and death, too.   Rhonda Keith   Lawrence, Kan.   ---   Pro-lifers say repeatedly that Supreme Court decisionshave mandated unlimited &quot;abortion on demand&quot; in the U.S. Asis typical, Mr. Lawler writes, &quot;In effect, the Roe v. Wadedecision (and the companion case Doe v. Bolton) prohibitedall public restrictions on abortion.&quot;   Perhaps Mr. Lawler feels he covers himself with &quot;ineffect.&quot; In any case, the truth is the Supreme Court hasnever prohibited states from restricting or even from banningabortion in the third trimester except when abortion isneeded to protect a woman's life or health.   Pro-lifers are, of course, welcome to argue that statesshould force women to carry pregnancies to term even at thecost of their lives or health. And now that the court isturning the abortion issue into a war in which each state isa battleground (or likely to become one), they can urgelegislatures to enact this view into law. Indeed, theanti-abortion plank of the Republican Party's platform makesno exceptions even for life-threatening pregnancies. But thepro-lifers shouldn't get by with constant misrepresentation.   Bradley Miller   Washington   ---   Mr. Lawler's comparison of the civil-rights movement withthe anti-abortion stand is illogical. The civil-rightsmovement was fought by the people who were being wronged.Slavery and its awful results were forced upon them and itwas they, the victims, who wanted the change.   Mr. Lawler would like to make slaves of pregnant women,forcing them to bear children they cannot care for. Whatcould be more totalitarian than taking away a woman's powerover her own body? Perhaps abortion shouldn't be used as abirth controller, but then, neither should Mr. Lawler, thestate or the church.   If he and the other anti-abortionists are so concernedabout these unwanted fetuses, why then don't they pay for thepregnancies, then adopt and care for the children? Let themraise them, educate them, pay for all their medical needs.When the anti-abortionists behave like true philanthropiststhey might be more convincing. Meanwhile, to me, they arejust people who think the sex act is evil and the perpetratordeserves punishment. (Notice, however, this doesn't includethe sperm carrier.)
