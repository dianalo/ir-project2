The administration imposed a temporary import suspension in Marchafter a public outcry over the Jan. 17 Stockton, Calif., schoolyardkilling of five children by a man wielding an AK-47.   However, the ban, made permanent in July, doesn't affect gunsalready owned by Americans or similar weapons produced by U.S.companies.   Joseph T. Wesbecker, who opened fire at Louisville'sStandard-Gravure Co. printing plant, appeared to be using``half-banana clips'' of about 25 rounds each in an AK-47, saidLouisville Police Chief Richard Dotson.   Such clips are curved and stick out the bottom of the weapon.   Wesbecker, who committed suicide after the rampage, also had a9mm semi-automatic pistol, Dotson said.   President Bush announced a crime package in May that would limitthe size of ammunition clips to 15 rounds, but the Senate JudiciaryCommittee hasn't voted on it.   The committee has approved a measure by Sen. Dennis DeConcini,D-Ariz., that would ban nine varieties of semiautomaticassault-style weapons, five already covered by the administration'simport ban and four others produced domestically.   DeConcini's bill, which would provide up to 10 years additionalprison time for those convicted of crimes involving firearms, wouldgo off the books in three years under a ``sunset'' provision.   The Senate leadership hasn't brought the bill to the floor for avote.   On Monday, American Bar Association President L. Stanley ChauvinJr. urged Bush to end the export of U.S.-made assault-style weaponsto Colombia, where 50 percent of sophisticated military equipmentseized from Colombian drug lords in the last 18 months was made inthe United States.   The ban on imports of 43 styles of guns _ including the popularChinese-made AK-47 and Israeli-made Uzi carbine _ followed afour-month study by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms onwhether the weapons met the standards imposed by the Gun Control Actof 1968, which barred importation of weapons not used for legitimatesporting purposes.   ``The study was undertaken because of the dramatic increase inthe number of these weapons being imported and police reports oftheir use in violent crime,'' ATF Director Stephen E. Higgins said.   The 43 models banned were ``not being used for sporting uses,''the agency said.   Higgins said the ATF annually traces 35,000 to 40,000 guns usedin crimes, and that about 10 percent are semiautomatic assaultweapons. He estimated that slightly more than half of those assaultweapons are domestic makes not subject to ATF control.</TEXT></DOC>
