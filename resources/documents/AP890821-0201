(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In a state with one of the highestpercentages of elderly people, a 3-year-old change in guardianshiplaws to protect the rights of prospective wards of the court hasrarely been used.   Meanwhile, the head of the state Department of Elderly Affairswas unaware that the legislature had made the 1986 change to allowjudges in the state's 39 probate courts to limit the powers ofcourt-appointed guardians and at least one judge said he didn'tunderstand it and hadn't used it.   ``What it means, nobody knows yet,'' said North ProvidenceProbate Judge Domenic Tudino. ``Until we get some case law from theSupreme Court,'' he said, interpretation of the measure would remainvague.   The intent ``was to provide the ward with as much latitude tolead a normal life'' as possible, said the sponsor, former Rep.Gilbert V. Indeglia. The law allows judges to limit guardianship tojust part of a ward's life, such as financial matters or medicalcare.   ``According to the affidavits of the medical people, (the wards)are really totally gone,'' said Scituate Probate Judge Theodore A.Miller. ``It's not a question of whether they can handlethemselves.''   Despite the infrequent use of the limited guardianship provision,other changes in 1986 improved the situation, Miller said. ``At onetime, just about anybody could go in and file a guardianshippetition and nobody else would have to be notified.'' Now, theperson's immediate heirs must be contacted.   The law was also changed to require the court to appoint aguardian ad litem, or friend of the court, to interview those in a``medical facility,'' although no such requirement exists for thoseliving elsewhere.   The determination of incompetency rests soley with a doctor, whois not required to be in court for questioning unless the case iscontested. The ward also does not have to appear before the judge,or to have legal representation.   Department of Elderly Affairs Director Adelaide Luber, whoacknowledged recently that she was unaware of the changes, saidnonetheless that it is easy to label an elderly person incoherent.``If you're the person whose bill isn't paid, you say that persondoesn't function,'' she said.   David Reidel, chairman of the state bar's probate committee, wasunaware of the changes in the law. So was Elderly Affairs Departmentprotective services monitor Mary Ann Ciano, a member of a committeeestablished last year by the legislature to study guardianships. Thepanel has yet to meet.   Joseph Smallens, the Elderly Affairs lawyer, said he didn't knowof any cases of limited guardianship in the state. Attorneys don'trequest it because ``traditionally lawyers are used to fullguardianship, probably because there is less paperwork involved. ...A year down the road someone may have to come back and get fullguardianship'' because the person continues to deteriorate.   Rhode Island, with 14.6 percent of its population aged 65 orolder, ranks third in the percentage of elderly residents, behindFlorida and even with Pennsylvania, according to the federalAdministration on Aging.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Aug. 24</NOTE></DOC>
