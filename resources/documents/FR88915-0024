L. 100-203 amendedsection 1613(d) (1) and (3) of the Social Security Act (the Act). Section1613(d)(1), as amended, now provides that in determining the resourcesof an individual (and spouse, if any) for SSI purposes, up to $1,500 perperson shall be excluded if separately identifiable and set aside for theburial expenses of the individual and/or the spouse, regardless of whethercounting any portion of such amount would result in excess resources. Section9105 has amended section 1613(d) (3) of the Act to provide that the penaltyfor use of excluded burial funds for a purpose other than to meet burialexpenses will apply only if the individual would have excess resourceswithout application of the exclusion. In situations where the penalty applies,the amount of the penalty will be equal to the amount spent for purposesother than those for which the funds were set aside and will be appliedas a dollar-for-dollar offset against future SSI benefits. These changeswere effective April 1, 1988.Prior to amendment by Pub. L. 100-203, section 1613(d) (1) of the Act providedfor the exclusion of funds set aside for the burial of an individual and/orhis spouse only when the inclusion of any portion of the funds in countableresources would cause the individual's resources to exceed the statutorylimit. If the burial funds along with the individual's other countableresources did not exceed the limit, the funds were not excluded.Section 1613(d)(3) provided, prior to amendment, that any excluded burialfunds used for a purpose other than to meet burial expenses resulted ina dollar-for-dollar offset of future SSI benefits. Additionally, section1613(d)(2) of the Act still provides that the $1,500 burial fund exclusionshall be reduced by the face value of any life insurance policies the cashsurrender value of which has been excluded from resources and the valueof any irrevocable burial arrangements. Further, section 1613(d)(4) ofthe Act allows the Secretary to provide by regulations for the exclusionfrom income and resources of appreciation in the value of and interestearned on and left to accumulate as part of excluded burial funds. Regulationsat 20 CFR 416.1231(b)(6) provide for the exclusion from resources of suchinterest and appreciation if left to accumulate in the fund. Thus, theamount excluded as burial funds may exceed $1,500 due to appreciation oraccumulated interest.<ITAG tagnum="84">Burial Funds_Proposed Policy Changes</ITAG>In addition to the revisions required by the statutory changes to sections1613(d)(1) and (d)(3), we are also proposing policy changes to the currentregulations at 20 CFR 416.1231. Current regulations at 20 CFR 416.1231(b)(3)define burial funds as revocable burial contracts, burial trusts or otherburial arrangements or any other separately identifiable funds which areclearly designated as set aside for the burial expenses of an individual(or spouse, if any). Over the years, the operational definition of burialfunds has gradually expanded to encompass assets other than funds, sometimeseven permitting exclusion of automobiles and livestock. We propose to implement a definition of burial funds which closely tracksthe original intent of the provision and is more in accordance with thecommonly accepted definition of ``funds.'' Under this change, burial fundswill be defined as revocable burial contracts, burial trusts, other burialarrangements, cash, accounts, or other financial instruments (documentswhich have a definite cash value) clearly designated for burial expenses.Real property or personal property other than listed above will not beconsidered ``funds.''Regulations of 20 CFR 416.1231(b)(1) state that burial funds must be keptseparate from other resources in order for the exclusion to apply. Overtime, operational procedures have interpreted ``separated'' to permit comminglingof funds as long as they are kept identifiable. We propose to implement the statutory and regulatory requirement that fundsbe kept ``separately identifiable'' to conform more closely with the languageof section 1613(d)(1) of the Act and with the legislative history of section9105 of Pub. L. 100-203 (H. Rep. No. 495, 100th Cong., 1st . Sess. 824-825(1987)). That is, we would require not only clear designation of the purposeof the fund, but also segregation of excluded burial funds from all otherresources, including burial spaces. This policy will eliminate time-consumingand often complex monthly computations which are not necessary when excludedand nonexcluded funds are commingled so that only part of the interestor appreciation is excludable. Under these two proposed changes, we will require recipients to convertresources currently excluded for burial that do not meet the new definitionof ``funds'' into resources that do, and to segregate excluded burial fundsfrom all other assets, unless there is an impediment to conversion/segregation;i.e., a circumstance beyond an individual's control which makes conversion/segregationimpossible or impracticable. For example, if an individual has 1 acre ofa 4-acre parcel of land designated as burial funds and zoning restrictionsprevent him or her from subdividing the land and selling only 1 acre, heor she is unable to convert the previously excluded land to conform withthe new definition of burial funds. We will exclude the property untilsuch a time as it can be converted. To lessen the effect of these changes,an individual will have until the first moment of the second month followingthe month of the first field office initiated redetermination on or afterthe effective date of these regulations to convert/segregate burial fundsnot meeting these proposed rules. For so long as an impediment exists,we will continue to exclude the burial fund if the individual remains otherwisecontinuously eligible for the exclusion. Prospectively, real property andpersonal property which do not meet the more restrictive definition ofburial funds will not be excluded; commingling of excluded burial fundswith any other excluded or nonexcluded resources, even with burial spacesand nonexcluded burial funds, will not be permitted, and commingled fundswill not be eligible for the exclusion. Current regulations at 20 CFR 416.1231(b)(6) provide for the exclusionof appreciation in the value of burial funds, as well as interest earnedon, and left to accumulate as part of, excluded burial funds. Thus, theamount excluded as burial funds may exceed $1,500 due to appreciation oraccumulated interest. If an individual's eligibility is suspended or terminatedand thereafter reinstated, only his or her burial funds up to the $1,500limit may be excluded. Any previously excluded interest and appreciationabove the $1,500 limit are countable resources. We propose to extend the burial funds exclusion throughout a period ofsuspension of up to 12 months as described at 20 CFR 416.1321, so longas the individual's eligibility has not been terminated under 20 CFR 416.1331through 416.1335. Thus, during a period of suspension, appreciation inthe value of excluded burial funds and interest earned on (and left toaccumulate as part of) excluded burial funds would also be excluded fromresources. The result would be continued exclusion of accumulated interestand appreciation when the individual once again becomes eligible for SSI,even if such amounts cause the total excluded to exceed $1,500. This extensionof the exclusion is based on the Secretary's authority under section 1613(d)(4)of the Act to determine by regulations how accrued interest and appreciationare to be excluded. However, the exclusion of interest and appreciationaccumulated on excluded burial funds while an individual is eligible basedon one application will not be carried over into a new period of eligibilitybased on a subsequent application to the extent that it would result inburial funds in excess of the $1,500 limit. This distinction is consistentwith the distinction in treatment we make in other SSI policies betweenindividuals whose benefits are merely suspended and those whose benefitsare terminated. <ITAG tagnum="84">Burial Spaces_Proposed Policy Change</ITAG>Section 1613(a)(2)(B) of the Act excludes from resources the value of anyburial space (subject to such limits as to size and value as the Secretarymay prescribe) held for the burial of an eligible individual or memberof his immediate family. The statute does not define a ``burial space.''Current regulations at 20 CFR 416.1231(a)(2) define burial spaces as ``conventionalgravesites, crypts, mausoleums, urns and other repositories which are customarilyand traditionally used for the remains of deceased persons.'' Over time,operational procedures have included in the definition of burial spacescoffins, vaults or liners, headstones or other grave markers and the costof opening and closing graves.We propose to specify in regulations at 20 CFR 416.1231(a)(2), the broaderoperational definition of burial spaces. Burial spaces will include burialplots, gravesites, crypts, mausoleums, urns, niches or other customaryand traditional repositories for the deceased's bodily remains. Additionally,the term will include improvements or additions to or upon such spacesincluding, but not limited to, vaults, headstones, markers, plaques, orburial containers and arrangements for opening and closing the gravesitefor burial of the deceased.The change in the regulatory definition is made based on the Secretary'sgeneral rulemaking authority since the Act does not define burial spaces.The operational definition of burial spaces has expanded over time basedon the regulatory definition of ``other repositories that are customarilyand traditionally used for the remains of deceased persons.'' This changeclarifies the regulatory definition specifically to include other itemswhich are in the form of improvements or additions to or upon the actualspace and are reasonably necessary and incidental to the disposition ofthe deceased's remains.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Procedures</ITAG>Executive Order 12291The Secretary has determined that these are not major rules under ExecutiveOrder 12291 since the program and administrative costs of this regulationwill be insignificant and the threshold criteria for a major rule are nototherwise met. Therefore, a regulatory impact analysis is not required.Paperwork Reduction ActThis regulation imposes no additional reporting and recordkeeping requirementrequiring Office of Management and Budget clearance.Regulatory Flexibility ActWe certify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities because this rule affects onlyindividuals and States. Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysis asprovided in Pub. L. 96-354, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, is not required.<ITAG tagnum="20">(Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program No. 13.807, SupplementarySecurity Income Program).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 20 CFR Part 416</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Aged, Blind, Disability benefits,Public assistance programs, Supplemental Security Income.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: July 13, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Dorcas R.
