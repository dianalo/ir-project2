The Survey employed a probabilitysample of 500 stream reaches representing a regional population of 64,700reaches portrayed as blue lines on 1:250,000 scale maps and which havedrainage areas less than 155 sq km. The NSS-I design allows regionalextrapolation, with known confidence, of the number and total lengthof reaches with specified chemical characteristics. Excluding Florida,the Southeastern subregions of the NSS-I were estimated to contain veryfew acidic (ANC less than 0) reaches. Acidic reaches were found primarilyin lowland reaches of Florida and the Mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain andin upland reaches of the Mid-Atlantic subregions. Sulfate concentrationswere markedly higher in the Mid-Atlantic than in the Southeast. Analysisof ion composition and evidence of stream acidification are presented.</TEXT></DOC>
