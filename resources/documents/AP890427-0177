The Center for Clean Air Policy, a Washington-based think tank,said its 18-month study showed that cutting electricity use wouldhelp both consumers and the utilities, as well as reduce carbondioxide emissions by substantial amounts.   Fossil fuels burned in power plants and by other energyproducers are blamed for the release of large amounts of carbondioxide, which is considered to be a major contributor to globalwarming.   The study focused on potential savings to two of the nation'slargest electric utility systems _ the Tennessee Valley Authorityand the American Electric Power Co. of Columbus, Ohio.   A 7 percent cut in electricity sales by American Electric by theyear 2000 would reduce by 26 percent, or $51 million, the amount itwould have to pay for pollution controls over that period.   A 10 percent drop in sales by TVA over the same period wouldreduce its pollution control costs by 55 percent, or $77 million,the study said.   These energy conservation programs would save AmericanElectric's customers $1.23 billion over the next 30 years, thestudy said. TVA's customers would save $891 million over the sameperiod. The savings are based in part on the assumption that lowerdemand would preclude the need for the utilities to invest in newgeneration capacity.   ``It's time we started addressing our basic environmentalproblems through approaches like energy conservation whicheliminate pollution rather than just moving it from the air intothe ground or water,'' said Tony Earl, the study group's chairman.</TEXT></DOC>
