As part of a settlement reached between Union Carbide and theIndian government, the Supreme Court of India on Tuesday ordered theU.S.-based multinational company to pay $470 million in compensationfor the death and injury caused by the lethal cloud of gas thatseeped out of a storage tank at the Bhopal pesticide plant operatedby its Indian subsidiary.   ``We have often been promised money, but for us it was moreimportant that those who killed our brothers and sisters should behanged,'' said 15-year-old Sunil Kumar, whose parents and fivebrothers and sisters died in the world's worst industrial disaster.   Kumar and a younger brother still live in the hut in the JaiPrakash shantytown where they were asleep with the rest of theirfamily when methyl isocyanate escaped from a storage tank in theUnion Carbide plant across the street on Dec. 3, 1984.   Soon after the disaster, the government awarded the boys about$5,833. It gave out $833 for each immediate family member whoperished.   Similar payments were made to relatives of hundreds of othervictims, but the major battle for compensation was waged in Indiancourts for four years. In 1986, after U.S. courts declinedjurisdiction in the case, the government of India sued Union Carbidefor $3 billion.   Tuesday's court decision for $470 million was received with angerby many survivors and the Bhopal political activists who hadespoused their cause.   ``We want justice!'' a crowd of 200 women chanted Wednesdayoutside government buildings in Bhopal, a city of 1 million peoplein central India.   ``The government has shaken hands with Union Carbide, whose handsare dipped in the blood of our brothers and sisters!'' one cried.   Another woman reminded the crowd of the Jan. 6 executions of twoSikhs convicted in the 1984 assassination of Prime Minister IndiraGandhi. ``Two people were hanged for killing one woman,'' she said.``No action was taken against those who killed thousands.''   The crowd responded by chanting: ``Hang Anderson!'' It was areference to Warren Anderson, the chairman of Union Carbide at thetime of the disaster.   The Supreme Court threw out all criminal charges pending in thecase, including one of culpable homicide against Anderson.   More than 2,000 people died almost immediately when the gasleaked from the plant operated by Union Carbide of India Ltd.   Deaths attributed to the gas continue at the rate of at least onea day, according to the government of Madhya Pradesh state. The tollhas reached at least 3,329.   More than 20,000 people are still listed as gas victims,suffering from shortness of breath, eye problems and other ailments.   The Indian government and the Danbury, Conn.-based Union Carbidecame close to an out-of-court settlement in November 1987 _ forabout $500 million, $30 million more than this week's court-orderedpayment.   To many in Bhopal, Tuesday's agreement smacked of collusion.   ``This shameless settlement shows that the multinationals havenot just the support of the Indian government but also of thehighest court in the land,'' said Alok Pratap Singh, a leader of thePoisonous Gas Episode Struggle Front.   Attorneys for the government and Union Carbide said thesettlement was fair and just, and it would enable compensation to begiven to the victims.   There has been no word on how the funds would be distributed.   In 1987, a tentative plan was drawn up to pay compensation torelatives of the dead and to gas-affected survivors. In addition,continuing free medical care would have been provided, disabledsurvivors _ many of them manual laborers no longer able to performphysically taxing jobs _ would have been retrained for new work, andrestitution would have been made for business and environmentallosses, including dead livestock.   On Wednesday, the Supreme Court said Union Carbide and its Indiansubsidiary must pay the $470 million by March 23, instead of byMarch 31 as ordered Tuesday. This was done because India's fiscalyear ends March 31.   The court Wednesday also agreed to a proposal by Union Carbidethat its Indian subsidiary pay part of the settlement.   Union Carbide Corp. will be responsible for $425 million of thesettlement. The court said it will have to pay only $420 millionbecause of a $5 million emergency payment the company made in 1985under orders from a U.S. court.   The subsidiary, Union Carbide of India Ltd., must pay theremaining $45 million. Union Carbide Corp. owns 50.9 percent of theIndian subsidary. Indian shareholders, including governmentinstitutions, have the remaining 49.1 percent.   This division should enable the parent company to make paymentwithout financial complications. It has already set aside $200million for the settlement and has insurance covering an additional$250 million, according to James Wilbur, a vice president with SmithBarney, Harris Upham and Co. Inc. in New York.   The Indian subsidiary said Wednesday it would meet its obligationprimarily through the sale of a chemical and plastic plant in Bombay.</TEXT></DOC>
