The average sportsmanor hunter does not need a weapon capable of firing 100 rounds aminute. It defies logic,'' she said Wednesday in a telephoneinterview.   But pro-gun forces defended the right of citizens to own guns,saying that more judicious prosecution of the gunman on previousarrests would have put him behind bars and averted the bloodbath.   ``It's a case study of the failure of the criminal justice systemthat this man was on the streets,'' said David Conover, a lobbyistwith the National Rifle Association. ``We continue to opposerestrictive gun control measures.''   ``Gun control laws in general don't work,'' said Craig Markva ofGun Owners of America, a lobbying group in Washington, D.C.``Everybody will be calling for mandatory background checks. (But)he would have slipped through the cracks even if he had a backgroundcheck.''   Patrick Edward Purdy, wearing a military flak jacket andearplugs, killed himself after firing up to 110 rounds from abayonet-equipped, semi-automatic AK-47 assault rifle at youngsterson recess Tuesday at Cleveland Elementary School in Stockton. Healso had two handguns.   Purdy, 26, bought the rifle, which he inscribed with the words``freedom'' and ``victory,'' for $147 in August in Sandy, Ore. Hehad at least four prior arrests in California, none of whichresulted in a felony conviction.   Under federal law, no felon can legally buy a gun.   Purdy pleaded guilty in 1983 to possessing martial arts weapons,which were wooden bars connected with chains, according to AlAlbergate in the Los Angeles County district attorney's office. Hewas jailed for five days.   Purdy also was charged with possession of marijuana, receivingstolen property and prostitution, but police said charges eitherwere dropped or they did not know the disposition of the case.   Stockton police also said Purdy was charged with robbery and themanufacture or sale of an illegal weapon, but prosecutors in LosAngeles were not aware of the charges or their outcome.   ``This is a person who should never be able to buy a weapon. It'stoo late for the children who are dead and dying,'' said GeraldArenberg of the National Association of Chiefs of Police.   A referedum to ban handguns will apparently be on the April 4ballot in Winnetka, Ill., where an emotionally disturbed babysitter,Laurie Dann, 30, went on a rampage May 20 at the Hubbard WoodsElementary School.   She killed an 8-year-old boy and wounded five other childrenbefore killing herself. She had three handguns she bought at a localshop.   ``We've got to stop this,'' said Christine Munroe, a parent wholed a petition drive to have handguns banned. ``I've always beenagainst handguns. Their only purpose is to kill another person. Idon't want anybody threatening my children.''   No gun control bans were proposed in Greenwood, S.C., where JamesWilson, a 19-year-old with psychiatric problems, killed two studentsand wounded seven pupils and two teachers. Wilson used a .22 caliberrevolver he took from his grandmother.   The California shootings revived anguish among school officials.   ``People who have emotional problems and want to take revenge onsociety are picking on our most vulnerable point, our children,''said school superintendent Robert Watson of Greenwood.   ``Small children are concentrated in groups. They don't run veryfast. They can't get away. Principals and teachers aren't much of amatch for someone with a gun.''</TEXT></DOC>
