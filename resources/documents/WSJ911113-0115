In recent weeks, the Turkish military has launched fierceraids against Kurdish guerrillas operating from bases innorthern Iraq. But while the attacks are inflicting heavydamage on the rebels, they also threaten to heighten supportfor the guerrillas among the normally quiescent 12 millionKurds who live in Turkey. And that, in turn, coulddestabilize a large part of the country.</LP><TEXT>   Last week, Turkey's National Security Council met inAnkara to discuss the crisis in the southeast, home to halfof Turkey's Kurds and scene of increasingly daring attacks byguerrillas seeking an independent Kurdistan. Giving no newsigns of recognizing Kurdish rights, a military spokesmansaid only that efforts would be made to seal off the Iraqiborder.   As the violence escalates, one member of Ankara'scaretaker government says Turkey is faced with two options:grant some sort of limited federation to the Kurds or facecivil war. But there are signs that a peaceful resolution isstill attainable. Kurdish representatives made impressivegains in the Oct. 20 parliamentary elections, boosting hopesthat Kurdish demands for full ethnic rights might besatisfied through political channels.   A Kurdish nationalist party, which has the rebels'backing, has entered the scene, winning as much as 70% of thevote in some Kurdish constituencies, and gaining 22 seats inthe new 450-seat assembly. The People's Labor Party, or PLP,could be a bridge of understanding to a Turkish establishmentthat until only recently referred to Kurds as &quot;mountainTurks.&quot; But some Turkish leaders criticize the PLP for actingas a legal wing of the terrorist Kurdistan Workers Party, orPKK.   The government's prime advocate of moderation is PresidentTurgut Ozal, who has said, &quot;We should be prepared to discusseverything, including a federation, because if we don't, therebels will.&quot; Mr. Ozal, who boasts of Kurdish blood in hisveins, has helped ease 70 years of suppression of Kurdishculture, partly repealing a ban on the public use of theKurdish language and music. But Mr. Ozal's influence has beenon the wane since his Motherland Party's loss in theelection.   A new government isn't expected to be formed until the endof the month. It is almost certain to be led by SuleymanDemirel, a conservative who is still on the fence on theKurdish question. Mr. Demirel promises a new era of justiceand human rights but also vows to crush separatist terrorism,which will likely mean a continuation of the policies thathave failed for eight years.   Discontent with those policies can be seen at funerals forsoldiers killed in the southeast -- nearly 100 have died thisyear -- where crowds gather, carrying signs with legends suchas &quot;Enough is enough.&quot;   In the most recent large-scale guerrilla attack, a raid onborder posts near Hakkari on the Iraqi frontier, at least 17soldiers were killed. A government spokesman said 400 PKKguerrillas participated in the biggest attack so far on amilitary target. The rebels used heavy mortars for the firsttime, the army says.   &quot;Turkey is living in an undeclared war,&quot; says Turkishnationalist leader Alpaslan Turkes. Indeed, diplomaticsources say some senior Turkish colonels would favorsomething closer to actual civil war.   &quot;We will stay within democratic limits,&quot; Gen. Dogan Gures,chief of the Turkish general staff, said recently. &quot;But if weavoided democratic niceties, we could finish this off in sixmonths.&quot;   Across the country, there is a sense that a new approachmust be found. But the correct tack is proving elusive. &quot;Thething is, we just have no idea who to talk to,&quot; said a seniorofficial in the Ozal administration. Mr. Ozal rules out talkswith the PKK, saying, &quot;There can be no negotiating withterror.&quot;   Turkey has traditionally dealt with the Kurds throughKurdish feudal lords, a system still in force in the tribalareas of the east. But elsewhere, the rebels now have almostundisputed control.   The PKK has said it is willing to accept an interim periodof federation with Turkey. But it hasn't dropped its ultimategoal of a united state giving complete independence to theKurds, a people of 25 million split between Turkey, Iraq,Iran, Syria and the U.S.S.R. The PKK has grown from a fewhundred people in 1984 to a formidable force of as many as5,000 guerrillas, according to Western diplomats and a seniorTurkish official who deals with the problem.   Over the course of the fighting, the guerrillas havegained increasingly sophisticated arms, the source of whichis unclear. The PKK's principal base is in Lebanon'sSyrian-controlled Bekaa valley. It also operates out ofSyria, northern Iraq and remote border areas of Iran.   Senior Western diplomats in Ankara say most PKK weaponswere plundered from Iraqi forces after the Persian Gulf War.There is no proof to back up reports that Baghdad may havebegun to resupply the PKK to punish Turkey for its pro-U.S.stand in that conflict, the diplomats and senior Turkishofficials said.   The U.S. and Britain quietly support Turkey against thePKK rebels. Germany has declared the PKK to be a terroristorganization, but some German officials have criticized thelatest Turkish raids.   The allied force at the U.S. air base at Incirlik hasn'ttried to stop Turkey's raids against the PKK in northernIraq, saying the allies' mission is only to protect displacedKurds. But after a third round of Iraqi Kurdish civiliancasualties was reported, the U.S. State Department pointedout that some of the Turkish attacks &quot;missed their targets.&quot;Foreign journalists reported witnessing Turkish jets strafingIraqi Kurdish villages and dropping napalm bombs.   The repeated raids into northern Iraq have resulted partlyfrom Turkey's fear of the PKK's growing influence in thatregion, which is only partly controlled by the IraqiKurdistan Front. Most Iraqi groups in the area are hostile tothe PKK's ruthless methods and Marxist ideology, and theFront agreed last month to try to prevent the PKK's raidsinto Turkey.</TEXT></DOC>
