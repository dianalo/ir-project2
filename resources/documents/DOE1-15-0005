A system is analyzed, in which a sphericalliner driven (by explosion products) to a suitable speed, strikes thecore composed of a layer of D-T ice and of a gaseous D-T centre, separatedby an internal, metal (Cu) liner. The variation of the critical-velocityvalues of the external motion of the liner in function of the initialradius of the core (R/sub o/) for several initial values of the densityof the gaseous centre (rho/sub {omega}/) has been studied. It has beenfound that in the two-liner systems these values are lower than thosein one-liner systems, the systems compared being of the same size andof the same quantity of the thermonuclear fuel. With non-profiled motionof the external liner the diminution of the critical velocity in relationto a one liner system is the greater, the greater is the initial radius(R/sub 1/) of the core of the system.</TEXT></DOC>
