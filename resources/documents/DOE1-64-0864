Highest nodularcorrosion was found with materials never {beta}-quenched during theirfabrication, whereas {beta}-quenched materials generally showed an improvedbehavior. Results of nodule thickness measurements after increasing burnupwere normalized by using a correlation w -- (BU)/sup 0.7/ (w = averagenodule oxide thickness, BU - burnup). The scatterband of the normalizeddata was different for different reactors. The statistical distributionwas generally Gaussian with a tail at high values. To find reasons forthe material-inherent scatter of the in-pile corrosion behavior, archivesamples were examined by electron microscopy and high-pressure steamtests. The latter led to a comparable ranking if the specimens were fullyrecrystallized before testing. The microstructural examinations indicatea correlation of the in-pile corrosion with the size distribution ofthe intermetallic precipitates and the spacing between the precipitates.High-pressure steam tests have been used to identify the fabricationsteps which influence nodular corrosion. According to these tests itis mainly the {beta}-quenching treatment and all annealing or workingsteps in the upper {alpha}-phase range that have an influence. Low nodularcorrosion was achieved using quenching rates andgt;5K/s if the subsequentannealing stays in the low {alpha}-range.</TEXT></DOC>
