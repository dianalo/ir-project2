DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The nation's stock exchanges don't have to beearthquake-proof _ or even fireproof _ but the Securities andExchange Commission wants them to figure out what they would do ifone hit.   The five-member commission voted unanimously Wednesday toapprove a policy statement calling on self-regulatory organizationsin the securities industry to review their computer systemsperiodically.   The SEC wants the industry to assess their systems' capacity tohandle heavy volumes of trades and their vulnerability to naturalcatastrophes and human tampering.   ``It is our belief that by providing guidance in this area wecan continue and encourage efforts in the self-regulatoryorganizations to increase the efficiency of our systems and reducethe risk that the systems themselves will be unable to operate intimes of stress,'' Richard G. Ketchum, director of the SEC'sDivision of Market Regulation, told the commissioners.   The new policy, which is purely voluntary, also will requestthat exchanges and the National Association of Securities Dealers,which oversees the over-the-counter market of stocks that are nottraded on exchanges, conduct ``stress tests'' of their automatedsystems to see how they would stand up to extremes in tradingvolume.   Another aim of the policy is to get exchanges to establishcontingency plans and develop backup facilities in the event of asystem failure.   The new policy is a response to the October 1987 market crash,when the trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange hit 1.2billion shares over two days.   That record surge caused backups in some automated systems,leading to delays in executing trades and transmitting transactionreports.   Automated systems were taxed again by last month's 190-pointdrop in the Dow Jones industrial average.   ``Wall Street can't work without computers,'' said CommissionerJoseph A. Grundfest.   The new policy also calls for the self-regulatory organizationsto assess the vulnerability of automated systems to threat such asfires, earthquakes and vandalism.   Options traders at San Francisco's Pacific Stock Exchange had tobe flown to other cities to resume trading after last month'searthquake.   Just last week, a fire in lower Manhattan in the buildinghousing the New York Stock and American stock exchanges' computersforced an hour-long delay in the opening of the two trading floors.   The SEC policy statement also requests exchanges to notify thecommission promptly of any instances of unauthorized access totheir computer systems.   Kathryn V. Natale, an assistant director of the SEC's MarketRegulation division, said there have been no instances ``to date''of unauthorized access but she said there is ``a greater threat aswe internationalize'' the markets.</TEXT></DOC>
