The March figure represents an increase of 8.7 million households since 1980. But the 1.2 million average net increase over that period is significantly below the 1.6 million annual increase between 1970 and 1980, the Census Bureau said.    The average household had 2.66 persons in March, down from 2.76 in 1980 and 3.14 in 1970.    However, according to the bureau, the increase in the number of people living alone -- previously a major factor in the rise in the number of households -- has also slowed. While persons living alone contributed almost 43% of the increase in households between 1970 and 1980 they accounted for only 33% of the increase since 1980.    Households comprising a married couple with their own children made up a smaller percentage of households than in the past: 27.5% in 1987 compared with 30.9% in 1980 and 40.3% in 1970.    According to the Census Bureau, Americans are continuing to delay marriage. For men, the median age at first marriage was 25.8 years in 1987, nearly as high as the record 26.1 in 1890. For women, the median age was 23.6 years in 1987, the highest ever recorded. </TEXT></DOC>
