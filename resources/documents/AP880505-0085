The steady stream of heat-blasted glass made the firefightingeffort particularly dangerous, Capt. Mike Bowers said. ``The glassfalling ... is severing our hose lines. And we can't sendfirefighters to replace them because they'll get severed.''   Firefighters extinguished the blaze at the First Interstate Bankearly this morning after it burned 3{ hours, spreading flames andsmoke as it snaked upward. Inspector Ed Reed called it the city'sworst high-rise fire.   Thousands of onlookers gathered downtown to take pictures andscoop up singed papers that fluttered to the street through brokenwindows.   Gary Stratton, 20, of Los Angeles, snared a singed page fromwhat appeared to be an office manual, and a few half-burnedreceipts.   ``I'll definitely be keeping this as a souvenir,'' Stratton said.   People craned their necks as helicopter spotlights illuminatedbright orange flames and plumes of thick smoke shooting out brokenwindows.   Inside, firefighters faced a hellish mix of heat and smoke.   ``We were on of the first fire companies up on the 12th floor,where the fire was,'' Fire Capt. Jeff Marcus said today on CBS-TV's``This Morning.'' ``We used the door as a barricade to keep theheat from coming into the stairwell.   Water hitting the hot metal girders and pipes sent clouds ofsteam spewing at firefighters, hampering visibility and spreadingsevere heat, Reed said.   Fire crews wearing breathing gear trudged up closed streets tothe blaze raging through the headquarters of the state'sthird-largest bank, evoking images of troops headed into battle.   The drone of helicopter rotors was mixed with the whine ofsirens, the sound of shattering glass and the roar of the flames adozen stories overhead.   ``This is one of the all-time big ones,'' fire Capt. SteveVarney said. ``The whole square block (building) is just full ofsmoke and heat.   ``Everything that was burnable, burned down. It was just metaland that was red hot ... It looked like Dante's Inferno.''   The fire erupted shortly after 10:30 p.m. Wednesday as workersinstalled piping for an overhead sprinkler system. Police lineskept the crowds back and traffic snarled as motorists parked fiveand six cars deep at the curb.</TEXT></DOC>
