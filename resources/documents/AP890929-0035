(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Coastal property owners in thishurricane-scarred state are being told a tough new conservation lawwon't necessarily keep them from rebuilding on the water's edge.   ``We don't want people to panic,'' said H. Wayne Beam, executivedirector of the South Carolina Coastal Council. ``People arecalling us, asking if all of Myrtle Beach will be affected by thelaw and it will not be.''   The 18-member council administers the controversial BeachfrontManagement Act, passed last year in response to an acceleratingerosion problem blamed on overdevelopment of the state's coastline.   The law, which took effect in July 1988, bans new constructionwithin a so-called ``dead zone'' extending inland 20 feet from anestablished dune line, and prohibits the rebuilding of any home orhotel in the zone that suffers more than two-thirds damage.   The controversial law was already under challenge beforeHurricane Hugo hit last week. Homeowners on Hilton Head Island hadfiled suit in federal court and the state Senate passed a revisiongiving the council more latitude to permit rebuilding within thedead zone. The House has not given its approval.   Hugo cut a swath of destruction along more than half of thestate's 187-mile coastline last week, and hundreds of coastalproperty owners are worried they won't be able to rebuild.   The council met Thursday to streamline recovery efforts. Ownersof damaged buildings, seawalls and docks will receive aconstruction permit without having to file for individualpermission. Those who must rebuild will have to apply for specialpermission.   The council also agreed to permit hotels to rebuild oceanfrontswimming pools damaged or destroyed by the storm and reallocated$10 million distributed before Hugo to refurbish the state'sbeaches; Hilton Head Island officials returned $6.25 millionallocated to them before the storm, which left their beacheslargely unscathed.   State tourist industry offficials were urging quick action toget beach resort areas back in shape for next year's season.   ``We represent a large part of the state's Golden Goose,'' saidMyrtle Beach Mayor Bob Grissom. ``We need to get to businessyesterday.''   While there are no estimates available on the number of beachproperties destroyed by Hugo, a survey taken before the storm foundthat only 200 owners did not have enough property to rebuild theirstructures by moving them several feet inland.   The other 700 structures in the survey were on lots big enoughfor the owners to move them outside the ``dead zone.''   Beam also said the two-thirds damage clause will be liberallyinterpreted.   ``There will be some losses, but a house will have to be in badshape to be considered two-thirds destroyed,'' he said. ``I believethere will be many buildings that may be condemned by localstandards that will not be considered beyond repair by us.''   Under the council's regulations, even homes lifted offfoundations or pilings can be replaced at their original site.</TEXT></DOC>
