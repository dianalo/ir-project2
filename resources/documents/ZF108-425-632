(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Dennis EskowandM;Managers whose hardware platforms include Macintosh networks say AppleComputer Inc. has a better understanding of the corporate environment than itdid two years ago.andP;  But the Cupertino, Calif., computer maker still isn't upto speed in the corporate world, and buyers say they have some majorconcerns.andM;&quot;Apple has their work cut out for them,&quot; said Derek Williamson, director ofuser support at American President Systems, the systems arm of steamshipcompany American President Lines Ltd. in San Francisco.andP;  &quot;I think they havebeen listening to customers, but they have to settle for themselves how todeal with the big corporate user.&quot;andM;Williamson's position echoed that of other managers who planned the Macinformation-systems conference, a gathering of Apple's biggest corporate Macsystems managers, which took place May 20 to 23 in San Francisco.andM;The group, dubbed Mac IS, presented Apple executives with a list of 40concerns, the biggest of which were to extend the Apple warranty to at leastone year; to tighten security in the network; to provide more diagnostictools; and to provide a centralized software-update capability.andM;The first point was taken care of a few days before Mac IS members werepolled, when Apple began issuing one-year warranties.andP;  The security andsoftware update issues will prove thornier, but Apple appears eager to dealwith them.andM;&quot;It was not by accident that we announced the warranty upgrade even beforeMac IS announced its demands,&quot; said Dave Cote, Apple's vice president ofmarketing.andP;  &quot;We recognize the corporate user's needs, and we're meeting themas we can identify them.&quot;andM;Mac IS members almost unanimously agree that the company is moving faster tomeet enterprisewide needs.andP;  But they perceive Apple as being in the middle ofa sometimes confusing transition.andM;&quot;Apple at one point was a charismatic company,&quot; said Eric Goldfarb,information-systems project leader for the Dominos Pizza chain in Ann Arbor,Mich.andP;  &quot;Somehow it grew into a kind of 'ad hocracy,' where it wasn't quitethe laid-back place it had been and wasn't quite a bureaucracy.&quot;andM;Goldfarb said Apple isn't yet answering all the issues that face a corporatemanager.andP;  The new Mac IIfx, for instance, &quot;is .andP;  .  .  like a Porsche enginein a Volkswagen body.&quot;andM;The Mac IIfx, he said, is a good machine &quot;if your main concern is cost, but acorporate user is concerned with performance and functionality even more.&quot; Hesaid corporate users would prefer that Apple open the Mac architecturefurther, as it did when it announced support for Unix, rather thanconcentrate on cutting prices.andM;&quot;We have one of the best tools for connecting into a multivendorenvironment,&quot; Cote said.andP;  Even the IIfx is a &quot;connection machine,&quot; he said,pointing out that its multiple ports allow for a variety of interfaces, newbus slots, video cards and graphic coprocessors.andM;Cote was speaking at the first of at least 40 two-day seminars that Apple isholding this year to reach information-systems managers with the message thatthe Mac is an enterprisewide machine.andM;&quot;Apple is trying very hard to be open with us,&quot; said Jim Young, president ofMac IS and assistant to the chairman at Electronic Data Systems Corp. &quot;Ithink you'll see progress at the next meeting.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
