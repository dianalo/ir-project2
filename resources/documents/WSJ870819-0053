The machines sift through records on 60 million voters to help strategists raise money, persuade wavering voters and rally supporters on election day.    &quot;We're providing tools for people to apply common-sense political knowledge,&quot; says Thomas Hofeller, director of computer services at the Republican National Committee and the party's chief computer proselytizer.    Republican &quot;tekkies&quot; are tuning up their technology for next year's presidential election. They are experimenting with a machine that reads newspapers to record statements by Democratic contenders. They are writing a book to show campaign managers how to use Lotus 1-2-3 software to analyze local voting habits. And they are beefing up their computer networks, which speed reports on congressional votes, news releases and campaign tips to local candidates and state parties.    Joe Irvin, the California Republican Party's communications director, gleefully awaits any future campaign stop by Delaware Democratic Sen. Joseph Biden. The Republican computer network will give him so much detail about Sen. Biden's conflicting statements on Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork, he figures, &quot;we'll be able to hammer him a day or two before he gets to the state.&quot;    Computer technology lets Republicans speak with one voice, and also helps candidates target messages to different groups of voters. But Larry Sabato, a political-science professor at the University of Virginia, contends that the party's infatuation with machinery diverts the party from grass-roots politics and makes it seem insincere and impersonal. &quot;Technology is a siren's song,&quot; he warns.    But it's a song that also lures Democrats, who lag about an election behind the Republicans in computer technology. This year, the Democratic Party plans roughly to match Republican computer spending of about $1.5 million to $2 million, and hopes to catch up in computerized information, too. Democrats have launched an ambitious program to identify the 16 million or so voters who oscillate between Republican and Democratic candidates.    &quot;By getting competitive in technology, we can prevent them from acing us out,&quot; says Rep. Tony Coelho, a California Democrat who has pushed his party to computerize.    Technology has hardly been a panacea for Republicans, however, despite their edge. In the last election, they lost control of the Senate and surrendered five seats in the House, where they already were greatly outnumbered. Nevertheless, Republicans say computers help their candidates run smarter campaigns, win tight races and cut losses.    Even in overwhelmingly Democratic districts, technology &quot;helps build the party,&quot; says John Maddox, deputy executive director of the National Republican Congressional Committee. &quot;Instead of running a campaign that gets 25% of the vote, you get 30% or 35%. That keeps the Democratic incumbent in his district raising money instead of out of his district campaigning against other Republicans.&quot;    And Republican strategists keep exploring new technology. Timothy Favia, president of Campaign Software Inc., a Washington concern that sells software to Republicans, boasts of his company's research into demographics and artificial intelligence. &quot;It's almost like Big Brother,&quot; he marvels.    One of the jewels of Republican technology is the Quotes system, which stores tens of thousands of statements by Democratic contenders on a powerful computer. In the last presidential election, Republican strategists consulted Quotes to prep President Reagan for debates against Walter Mondale and to write stump speeches for Reagan allies who attacked the Democratic challenger and his running mate.    Quotes also turned up a long-forgotten speech Gary Hart made at a Cleveland Rotary club lambasting the &quot;Carter-Mondale&quot; administration for high inflation. Reagan campaign aides found a videotape of that speech and turned it into a 30-second TV ad that they aired regularly in Ohio during the last two weeks of the campaign. &quot;It solidified our position in Ohio and helped widen the gap,&quot; says Doug Watts, the Reagan campaign's former media director.    Perhaps the greatest help the Republican Party offers national or local candidates is detailed voter information, which they can use to raise money or reach voters. Party computers store the age, address, telephone number, party enrollment, ethnic group and income level of tens of millions of voters. Often, voters tell canvassers whom they plan to vote for, and that information is stored on the computers, too. &quot;Chances are that people who voted for Fritz Mondale never need to be contacted again&quot; by Republicans, says Mr. Hofeller, the director of the Republicans' computer services. &quot;They're hard-core Democrats.&quot;    Republicans also run a variety of computer networks linking local campaigns to Washington. The National Republican Congressional Committee dispatches about a dozen field operatives equipped with Radio Shack lap-top computers. The field workers file reports to Washington by computer and receive their next day's instructions. One field worker even kept a romance alive by sending notes by computer to a headquarters staffer; they married after the election.    Another computer network, called the Republican Information Network, gives House candidates updated information on congressional votes, and relays releases and position papers on fast-breaking news. The help is especially valuable for challengers, who frequently can't afford research aid.    Rep. Jack Buechner, a Missouri Republican who last year defeated five-term Democratic incumbent Robert Young, says he used the information network to tag his opponent as a big spender. The network quickly transmitted votes on spending issues, including one in which Rep. Buechner's opponent voted to continue paying for operators on the Capitol's automatic elevators. &quot;It was only $92,000, but the media loved it,&quot; he says.    In 1984, Rep. Jim Kolbe, an Arizona Republican, edged out Democratic incumbent James McNulty, in part by castigating him for voting for a procedural move intended to block a major package of anti-crime legislation. Rep. Kolbe says he only learned about the vote via the Republican Information Network. &quot;We knew at the exact instant what the vote was, what its significance was,&quot; he says. &quot;We could be on the attack before he (the incumbent) was back in his office.&quot;    Not all Republicans have such cheery experiences with computers. Richard McIntyre says his campaign last year to unseat Rep. Frank McCloskey (D., Ind.) was hobbled when his computer's hard-disk storage device failed, leaving him no way to get at his computerized contributor records. Mr. McIntyre says the campaign labored for a week to retype the information into the computer, losing between $20,000 to $40,000 that it could otherwise have raised by mailing appeals for money and staging fund-raisers.    A scheme by the Republican National Committee to use computers to challenge voter registrations last year in Louisiana during a Senate race also backfired because the plan seemed aimed at disqualifyng blacks. &quot;There was a misuse of computer technology,&quot; acknowledges Henson Moore, the Republican candidate, who lost the election.    ---                       Computer Spending    Total computer spending by candidates for 1986 elections,in millions of dollars                                   HOUSE        SENATE    Computer hardware              $1.920       $ .340    Computer lists                  1.800         .620    Computer services               2.120        6.550    Computer software                .600         .140    TOTAL                          $6.440       $7.650    Source: National Association of Broadcasters</TEXT></DOC>
