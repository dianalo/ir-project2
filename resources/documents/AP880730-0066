(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Town Council on Saturday lifted anemergency curfew imposed after the young people rioted and marchedon the police station to protest underage drinking arrests, themayor said.   Mayor Charles Moll ordered a dusk-to-dawn curfew for groups onthe streets after about 50 young people smashed windows and marchedon the police station Thursday night. He also asked thePennsylvania National Guard to be ready if police were unable tocontrol the crowd.   ``We hope that everything is going back to normal,'' Moll said.``We felt the emergency was over. We'll have to see what happens.''   Thursday's disturbance in this north-central Pennsylvania townof 1,300 was seen by some as the culmination of months of tensionbetween police and young people who gather on the town's mainthoroughfare.   ``All they want to do is loaf on the main street,'' Moll saidafter the riot. ``There's drugs, there's drink, there's sex.''   Tensions flared late Thursday when officers attempted to arresta 17-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man for drinking and theyresisted arrest, police said.   Six people were charged with participating in a riot.</TEXT></DOC>
