REID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A beleaguered President CorazonAquino declared a state of national emergency today and pleadedwith fellow Filipinos to defy the hundreds of mutinous soldiers who``want to kill me.''   The declaration came after a cease-fire between rebel andloyalist troops enabled about 1,800 foreigners, hundreds of themAmericans, to be evacuated from Manila's financial district, sceneof heavy fighting since Saturday.   The rebels, angered at U.S. military support for Mrs. Aquino,had on Tuesday threatened to prevent some Americans from leaving.Today, they issued a veiled threat against those who remain in thecountry.   After the evacuation, rebel and military representatives thenopened talks for a peaceful settlement of the crisis.   Mrs. Aquino had previously vowed not to negotiate, demandingthat the rebels ``surrender or die.'' She had also overruledrecommendations from Cabinet members two days ago to declare astate of emergency.   ``You, my beloved countrymen, I depend on you,'' the obviouslystrained and fatigued Mrs. Aquino said on natonal television beforedeclaring the emergency. She appealed for a show of ``peoplepower'' in the streets on Friday similar to the 1986 demonstrationsthat helped put her in office.   The plea came five days after thousands of mutineers launchedthe strongest attempt yet to topple Mrs. Aquino's administration,which has been widely criticized as indecisive and inept.   It was unclear what specific powers Mrs. Aquino would be able towield under the emergency declaration. Press Secretary AdolfoAzcuna said the government planned to take over utilities andtransport but not the media.   Sen. John Osmena said most of the 23 senators endorsed the moveand he expected Congress to grant Mrs. Aquino sweeping powers.   But opposition Rep. Salvador Britannico said it would discourageforeign investment and tourism: ``The opposition believes that itis a first step...toward the declaration of martial law.''   Cabinet officials said the declaration was not tantamount tomartial law and that there would be no curtailment of civilliberties.   ``This is not martial law,'' said Labor Secretary FranklinDrilon. ``There's no curfew, there's no suspension of the writ ofhabeas corpus. Congress will continue. We will continue to enjoyour rights. It only empowers government to check those who may notbe delivering basic services.''   The announcement came as estimated 400 rebel soldiers continuedto hold the Makati financial district and a similar number ofmutineers held an air base on Cebu Island about 350 miles south ofManila.   Opposition sources claim the rebels also have the support ofother units that have not moved overtly against the government.   The insurrection, the sixth in Mrs. Aquino's nearly 4-year-oldgovernment, has claimed the lives of at least 77 people and leftmore than 540 wounded.   On national television tonight, the president attempted torekindle the now-dormant ``people power'' that toppled FerdinandMarcos and propelled her into office with a plea for people to taketo the streets on Friday.   She said the rebels wanted to dismantle democracy and return thenation to the dark days of martial law, which Marcos imposed from1972 until 1981.   ``I am telling you now that I put so much at stake fordemocracy,'' the president said, speaking extemporaneously.   ``I have lost my husband. ... It is very clear that these peoplewant to kill me, want to eliminate me so that they can rule ourland,'' she said.   Mrs. Aquino's husband, Sen. Benigno Aquino Jr., was slain in1983 moments after returning from the United States to challengeMarcos for leadership.   The rebels have demanded that she resign in favor of a coalitionto pave the way for a referendum on a new form of government. Thehave accused her of ignoring corruption, refusing to intiate socialand economic reforms, and failing to crush the Communist insurgency.   Early today, buses began transporting foreigners trapped inhotels and condominiums in Makati, which the insurgents seized onSaturday.   U.S. Embassy and Philippine authorities said at least 241Americans were among the foreigners taken out safely.   During the evacuation, military chief of Staff Gen. Renato deVilla designated Brig. Gen. Arturo Enrile, superintendent of thePhilippine Military Academy, to negotiate with the rebels in thefinancial district.   Sporadic sniping resumed, however, when the evacuation wascompleted.   More than 30 buses shuttled between the battle zone and ashopping area near the airport, where evacuees were taken untilarrangements could be made for them to leave the country.   ``It was slick,'' said Crosby Nash, 58, of Centreville, Md., ofthe evacuation. He had been stranded at the Manila Garden Hotel.``It was a superb operation. I think there's certainly relief.''   A rebel officer had said trapped Americans might not go freebecause, in a gesture of support for Mrs. Aquino, whose termexpires in June 1992. U.S. warplanes providing air cover forloyalist forces early in the revolt.   But a statement issued today said the insurgents' executivecommittee decided late Tuesday to free all the Americans because``these American tourists are not our enemy.''   Later today, however, a statement issued in the name of a rebelleader, Brig. Gen. Edgardo Abenina, declared the insurgents were ina ``state of war.''   ``We advise the U.S. government to prepare a plan for theevacuation of its nationals as the impotent Aquino administrationmay not be able to ensure their safety,'' said the statementdistributed to news organizations.   ``We appeal to the American people to exert pressure on theUnited States government to refrain from pursuing any policy oraction which may trigger a new Philippine-American War.''</TEXT></DOC>
