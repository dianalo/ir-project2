But U.S. dollars to match the tasksare not forthcoming and the United States remains the biggest U.N.debtor.   The United States is urging the world body to take on moreresponsibilities _ from monitoring the Soviet withdrawal fromAfghanistan and Cuban withdrawal from Angola to fighting terrorismand drug trafficking and investigating human rights abuses andchemical warfare.   It also is expected to monitor the eventual Vietnamese withdrawalfrom Cambodia and to play a role in a Middle East settlement.   But little money is forthcoming from the U.S. Congress to fundthe burgeoning U.S. agenda for the 159-nation organization. TheUnited States is the largest U.N. contributor, assessed one-quarterof the annual budget of $800 million.   While the United Nations has registered a series of formidablepeacemaking and peacekeeping successes that advance U.S. interests,Congress has been withholding U.S. dues.   The United States ended 1988 about $402 million in arrears inbudget and peacekeeping dues _ 53.5 percent of the total U.N.arrears of more than $750 million.   Largely because of U.S. nonpayment, the United Nationsperiodically faces financial crises and is having trouble paying fornew peackeeping operations.   President Bush, a former U.S. ambassador here, praised the UnitedNations during his election campaign and called for the payment ofU.S. dues.   Congress has been withholding a large part of the dues because ofbudget constraints and disaffection with the world body. Theorganization was seen as biased against the United States,bureaucratically bloated and wasteful.   Some money was withheld in an effort to force the United Nationsto reform itself, despite administration and State Department callsfor full-funding.   George P. Shultz said before leaving office as secretary of statesaid it is important for U.S. foreign policy ``to fully fund ourcontributions to U.N. agencies ... and to initiate a plan to payarrearages ... over a five-year period.''   He said the request for nearly full payment of dues ``is criticalto our objectives of resolving regional conflicts. The U.N. can playan important role in this regard.''   U.S. Undersecretary of State Richard S. Williamson, in charge ofinternational organizations, said, ``Up through last year, theExecutive, State Department and White House sought full funding.Congress failed to appropriate the full amount.''   In a telephone interview, Williamson said some people ``hold theUnited Nations in disrepute when it does disreputable things.'' Itrightfully is criticized, he said, for overspending and forpolitical moves like a General Assembly resolution equating Zionismwith racism.   But he said the United Nations has improved because the UnitedStates took a firm stand.   Last year, the United Nations scored spectacular achievements andits peacekeeping forces won the Nobel Peace Prize.   In Afghanistan, U.N. observers are monitoring Soviet withdrawalunder a U.N.-mediated agreement. For years, ending Sovietinvolvement in Afghanistan was a prime U.S. foreign policy goal.   In the Persian Gulf, U.N. peacekeepers are monitoring acease-fire while Iran and Iraq are talking under U.N. auspices. Thecease-fire enabled the United States to scale back its costly navalpresence there.   In southern Africa, the United Nations is helping to fulfillanother U.S. goal: getting Soviet-backed Cuban troops out of Angola.U.N. observers will monitor the Cuban pullout and peacekeepers willoversee Namibia's transition to independence from South Africa undera U.N. plan.   In the Western Sahara conflict, a U.N. peace plan has beenaccepted by Morocco, anti-Moroccan guerrillas and Algeria and theworld body will supervise free elections there. In Cyprus, U.N.Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar has sponsored talksbetween Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities to discussreunification of the Mediterranean island.   In his final budget, President Ronald Reagan requested nearlyfull U.N. funding in the 1990 fiscal year _ $205.5 million for theregular budget _ plus an additional $46 million to begin paying offU.S. arrears. The arrears of $403 million include $307.7 million forthe budget and $94.1 million for peacekeeping.   The Soviet Union has been paying its arrears and now owes $9million to the regular budget and $172 million to peacekeeping.   For almost eight years the Reagan administration and the worldbody were estranged. The United States charged it was ineffectual,pro-Soviet, anti-American and wasteful. But in his farewell addressto the General Assembly in September, Reagan praised the world bodyfor helping to end regional conflicts.</TEXT></DOC>
