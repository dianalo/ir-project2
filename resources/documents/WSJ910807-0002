The plan was disclosedwell after the stock market closed.   The move is a signal that NL and Mr. Simmons have hadtrouble identifying acquisition targets. The company hadabout $767 million in cash and equivalents at June 30 and hasbeen scouting for a major acquisition after bailing out ofits investment in Lockheed Corp. earlier this year. A companyspokesman said that the stock buy-back, which could costbetween $145 million and $175 million is a way of investingin the company while giving shareholders an equal chance tosell their shares.   Valhi Inc., Mr. Simmons' holding company that owns 68.6%of NL's 63.4 million shares outstanding, said it probablywill tender some shares in the offer, but said it hasn'tdetermined how many or at what price. The spokesman said thatif Valhi sells NL shares, it probably would use the proceedsto repay bank debt.   NL said the offer won't be contingent on a minimum numberof shares being tendered, and said it may purchase as many as1.3 million additional shares. The offer will expire 20business days after it begins. Salomon Brothers Inc. ismanaging the offer.</TEXT></DOC>
