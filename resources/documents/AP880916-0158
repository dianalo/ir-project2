Thousands of residents along Texas' 370-mile coast, manyevacuated to higher ground after piling sandbags in the doorways oftheir homes and boarding up windows, huddled in shelters and waitedfor the news:   When and where would Gilbert hit?   ``We are going to sit and wait and pray for the best,'' saidLarry Brown, director of transportation for Brownsville, whereofficials estimated that as much as one-fourth of the city of110,000 could end up in emergency shelters.   By Thursday evening, Port Isabel, a city of about 5,000 justeast of Brownsville, was a virtual ghost town. Officials alsoevacuated the coastal resorts of South Padre Island and Galveston.   More than a half dozen tornadoes accompanying the hurricane hitthe Brownsville area today in advance of the center of the storm,blowing over at least two homes and injuring one person, a boy whosuffered a minor head wound. Scattered flooding was reported.   Police were ordered to leave North Padre Island when water beganflooding the causeway to the mainland. The city had asked everyoneto leave the island but police Chief Robert Olson said he had heardthat about 10 to 15 residents remained there overnight.   An estimated 25,000 people evacuated low-lying villages insouthern Louisiana and officials said they wouldn't let peoplereturn home until they were sure Gilbert had run ashore elsewhere.   A Coast Guard helicopter today rescued five people from afishing boat near Port Isabel and the Coast Guard sent a search andrescue boat after seven people on a boat in Matagorda Bay. The boatwas found beached with no one aboard, and officials were searchingalong the coast for the occupants.   By early today, the storm had weakened since its destructiveassault on the Caribbean, and despite forecasters' predictionsGilbert showed little sign of strengthening as it headed for thearea around Brownsville at the southern tip of Texas.   ``It has not strengthened since it left Mexico, but we stillbelieve some strengthening is possible. It's not ever going to getback up to Category 5 strength with 175 mph winds, but it verypossibly could reach 130 or 140 mph,'' said Jim Gross, a hurricanespecialist at the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla.   The Hurricane Center said if Gilbert continued in the samedirection, the eye of the storm would come ashore near theTexas-Mexico border sometime this evening.   According to a rough estimate, the eye of the hurricane will hitthe coast between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m., about 50 to 60 miles south ofBrownsville, said Dave Petrovich, a weather service forecaster inMiami.   Winds gusting up to 60 mph, accompanied by rain and squalls,began pounding South Texas and northern Mexico today as preview ofthe fury of Gilbert, which has left at least 58 dead, $8 billion indamage and more than half a million homeless on several Caribbeanislands and Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula.   The National Weather Service issued a hurricane warning forMexico's northern coast and the southern half of the Texas coastfrom Brownsville to Port O'Connor, including 250,000-residentCorpus Christi. A hurricane watch remained in effect for theremainder of the Texas coast, from Port O'Connor north to PortArthur near Louisiana.   At 2 p.m. CDT, the storm center was near latitude 24 north,longitude 97.1 west, or about 130 miles south-southeast ofBrownsville, moving northwest at 12 mph, with maximum sustainedwinds of 120 mph and accompanied by a 10- to 15-inch rainfall.   Under state law, Brownsville officials could not order people toevacuate their homes, but police Sgt. Dean Poos noted, ``Where areyou going to put 100,000 people anyway?''   ``We have all kinds of people here, from those that needPampers, to those that need wheelchairs,'' said Ersel Lantz, whowas heading the Red Cross effort at the city's civic auditorium.   Gov. Bill Clements dispatched Texas National Guard units toMcAllen, Alice and Corpus Christi.   ``In terms of preparations, there's really nothing left to bedone,'' said Judy Oestrich, assistant American Red Cross chaptermanager in Corpus Christi. ``We're doing what we do _ taking careof people.''   Juan Garza, city manager of Corpus Christi, said 12 to 15evacuation centers are full, with a total of 26 to be set up ifnecessary.   ``I think we're ready. What you do for a hurricane is you don'tmanage it; you just kind of endure it,'' he said today on CBS's``This Morning.''   In Matamoros, Mexico, a city of 280,000 on the northeastern U.S.border across from Brownsville, thousands of people crowded intoshelters set up at schools, churches and public buildings after thehurricane left 17 dead in the Yucatan Peninsula.   On the island city of Galveston, scene of the worst naturaldisaster in U.S. history when a hurricane hit in 1900, killing6,000, about 40 percent of the island's 65,000 residents wereevacuated by early today, said Galveston public information officerDavid Hoover.   To the north in Houston, NASA's Johnson Space Center all butshut down Thursday, with most of its 9,000 employees sent home toprepare for Gilbert.   And in south Louisiana, 25,000 people fled the most vulnerablevillages despite being out of the high-danger area.   Gilbert's sustained winds have died down from 175 mph in theCaribbean to 120 mph after it passed over Yucatan on Wednesday. Itsranking was lowered from Category 5 _ the most fierce _ to aCategory 3.   The storm's earlier landfalls left at least 26 people dead inJamaica, five in the Dominican Republic and 10 in Haiti.   In addition, a 3-year-old Rockport, Texas, boy drowned earlytoday after falling off his family's shrimp boat as it was beingmoved to safe mooring. Calhoun County Sheriff's office spokesmanRick Prush said the boy's death was indirectly related to Gilbert.</TEXT></DOC>
