Northwest explains that the meterstation will cost approximately $2.9 million and would be able to handlethe increased storage field withdrawal capability proposed by WNG in DocketNo. CP88-833, up to 450 MMcf/d firm plus up to 72 MMcf/d best efforts,while being able to provide deliveries to Jackson Prairie at essentiallythe same level as Northwest's existing meter station; (2) permission andapproval for Northwest to abandon its existing Jackson Prairie meter stationby removal of the facilities which would not be needed when the new meterstation is operational; (3) blanket certificate authorization, with pre-grantedabandonment upon expiration of applicable service agreements, for Northwestto provide additional open-access contract storage services under RateSchedule SGS-2 utilizing: (a) Northwest's ownership share of the incrementalexpansion of the Jackson Prairie storage field capacity (766,668 Mcf storagecapacity and 25,000 Mcf/d withdrawl capacity) and (b) Northwest's ownershipshare of the existing Jackson Prairie storage capacity which presentlyis certificated for Rate Schedule SGS-1 services to the extent that abandonmentapproval is hereafter received for such existing SGS-1 services; (4) certificateauthorization to revise Northwest's SGS-2 Rate Schedule and form of serviceagreement thereunder to show that demand charges and capacity demand chargeswould not be applicable to SGS-2 services which utilize WNG's and The WashingtonWater Power Company's (WWP) owned capacity in the Jackson Prairie storagefield; (5) certificate authorization for Northwest to utilize on an interruptiblebasis any unused injection and withdrawal capacity at Jackson Prairie andup to 1 Bcf of any available storage inventory capacity at Jackson Prairiefor its system supply gas in order to help operationally balance its storage,sales and transportation services on a daily basis; (6) permission andapproval to abandon 833,334 Mcf of cushion gas inventory in the JacksonPrairie storage field by conversion to working gas in the storage fieldfor ultimate withdrawal and use as system supply. This volume representsNorthwest's one-third ownership share of the 2.5 Bcf cushion gas decreasefor the storage field which was proposed by WNG in Docket No. CP88-833;(7) certificate authorization to modify Rate Schedule SGS-1 storage servicefor WNG by increasing firm daily contract demand from 1,561,859 thermsto 1,789,631 therms, decreasing best-efforts daily withdrawal volumes from311,018 therms to 305,080 therms, increasing the maximum daily quantity(MDQ) Northwest shall be obligated to deliver to the South Seattle meterstation from 572,350 therms to 743,000 therms, and adding the Duvall-CottageLake meter station as a delivery point with an MDQ of 56,540 therms; allin accordance with a new SGS-1 service agreement between Northwest andWNG, dated September 30, 1988; (8) certificate authorization to provideRate Schedule SGS-2 storage service for Cascade Natural Gas Corporation(CNG) at a daily contract demand level of 150,000 therms and a seasonalcapacity level of 4,800,000 therms; all in accordance with the <T3>pro forma </T3>proposed SGS-2 service agreement between Northwest andCNG. These service quantities are equivalent to the portion of WWP's ownershipshare of the incremental Jackson Prairie capacity proposed by WNG whichWWP intends to release to CNG; (9) certificate authorization to modifyRate Schedule SGS-1 storage service for WWP by increasing firm daily contractdemand from 680,000 therms to 762,000 therms, increasing firm seasonalcapacity from 15,048,000 therms to 24,262,663 therms, decreasing best-effortsdaily withdrawl volumes from 250,822 therms to 246,041 therms, and furtherconditioning Northwest's obligation to deliver the daily contract demand;all in accordance with a <T3>pro firma </T3>proposed new SGS-1 service agreement between Northwestand WWP. Northwest's concurrence to a new SGS-1 service agreement providingfor increased service to WWP is contingent upon Pacific Gas TransmissionCompany (PGT) providing a requested transportation service from Stanfield,Oregon to Spokane, Washington for Northwest or the Commission acknowledgingthe inherent theoretical overcommitment of Northwest's firm capabilityto service WWP and explicitly absolving Northwest of any liability, otherthan the requisite demand charge adjustments under its tariff, its operationalcircumstances result in curtailments of SGS-1 service to WWP; (10) certificateauthorization to modify Rate Schedule SGS-1 storage services for CP NationalCorporation, CNG, Greeley Gas Company, Intermountain Gas Company, NorthwestNatural Gas Company and Paiute Pipeline Company to: (a) Reflect the lowerthermal quantities which result from application of an updated conversionfactors (1028 Btu's per cubic foot instead of 1048) to the unchanged volumetriccapacity allocated to these services; (b) further condition Northwest'sobligation to deliver the daily contract demand to CPN and CNG; and (c)add the existing Aberdeen meter station as an SGS-1 delivery point to IGCwith an MDQ of 25,000 therms, increase IGC's total MDQ's by an additional4,191 therms and reallocate IGC's MDT's among the existing delivery pointson its service agreement; all in accordance with the <T3>pro forma </T3>proposed new SGS-1 service agreements; (11) certificateauthorization to revise Sections 5 and 10.4 of Rate Schedule SGS-1 andSection 5 and 8.2 of Rate Schedule SGS-2 to incorporate a modified formulatieing Northwest's daily delivery obligation for a customer to the amountof gas stored for the customer's account. The modified formula providesthat Northwest's daily delivery obligation under an SGS-1 or SGS-2 serviceagreement would be at 100 percent of the contract demand under the serviceagreement only until 45 percent of the storage capacity volume under theservice agreement is withdrawn (SGS-2) or delivered (SGS-1). For withdrawalsor deliveries thereafter, Northwest's daily delivery obligation would bereduced by one percent of the contract demand for each additional one percentof the storage capacity volume withdrawn or delivered beyond said 45 percent.For the purpose of this calculation, the amount of storage capacity volumedeemed to have been withdrawn or delivered under the service agreementis the volume equal to the full storage capacity covered by the serviceagreement less that actual volume of gas in storage for the customer'saccount under the service agreement on any day.Comment date: July 11, 1989, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F atthe end of this notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">9. Northwest Pipeline Corporation</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">[Docket No. CP89-1580-000]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="44">June 20, 1989.</ITAG>Take notice that on June 6, 1989, Northwest Pipeline Corporation (Northwest),295 Chipeta Way, Salt Lake City, Utah 84108, filed in Docket No. CP89-1580-000,pursuant to section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act and section 157 of theCommission's Regulations, a petition for clarification of its existingcertificate authorizations for open-access transportation and transportationon the system of Pacific Gas Transmission Company (PGT) or, in the alternative,a petition to amend those certificates to allow Northwest to provide open-accesstransportation to its sales delivery points located off PGT's pipeline,all as more fully set forth in the petition which is on file with the Commissionand open to inspection.Northwest states that pursuant to the certificate issued in Docket No.G-17350, PGT is authorized to transport, on a firm basis, up to 151,731Mcf per day of natural gas from Kingsgate, British Columbia, for deliveryto Northwest at the Spokane, Washington, interconnect with Northwest'sSpokane Lateral and various points off PGT's transmission line in the statesof Idaho, Washington and Oregon where Northwest has obligations to providefirm deliveries of sales and storage gas to Cascade Natural Gas Corporation(CNG), The Washington Water Power Company (WWP), and CP National Corporation(CPN). It is further stated that uncertainty over future availability ofsystem supply at Kingsgate, coupled with a precipitous decline in Northwest'srequirement for system supply in the current open-access transportationenvironment, have seriously eroded Northwest's confidence in its abilityto rely upon displacement of system supply purchases at Kingsgate in orderto continue guaranteeing firm deliveries of gas to delivery points locatedoff PGT's system and off Northwest's Spokane Lateral.Northwest avers that CPN, CNG and WWP would like Northwest to treat theiroff-PGT delivery points equivalently to their other delivery points withrespect to the availability and flexibility of Northwest's sales and transportationservice in order to take full advantage of Northwest's open-access status.Northwest states that with respect to that specific issue, the January31, 1989, initial decision in Docket No. CP86-578-000, 46 FERC andpara; 63,006,involving Northwest's proposed gas inventory charge (GIC) created an exemptionfrom the GIC for any customer requesting firm sales to transportation conversionsat the off-PGT delivery points until Northwest is able to secure the rightto use its firm transportation capacity on PGT to satisfy such conversionrequests.Further, Northwest states that CPN has elected to convert all of its remaining7,000 MMBtu's per day of Rate Schedule ODL-1 sales contract demand to firmtransportation subject to certain conditions. CPN's conditions primarilyaddress its concern to maintain service to Klamath Falls, Oregon, its majormarket off the PGT system. Northwest requests that the Commission satisfyCPN's concerns prior to expiration of the existing sales service, by clarifyingexisting authority or granting new authority as necessary to allow transportationand storage gas to be delivered by Northwest and PGT to Klamath Falls.Accordingly, since Northwest's blanket transportation certificate and thePGT-Northwest transportation certificate do not unequivocally permit Northwestto provide the desired flexibility of service to off-PGT points, it isincumbent upon Northwest to seek the instant clarifications and/or authorizations.Specifically, Northwest requests clarification that, in recognition ofthe up to 100 percent conversion opportunity mandated by 18 CFR 284.10(c)(3),its blanket transportation certificate implicitly authorized Northwestto utilize its certificated transportation service on PGT's system to implementconversions to open-access transportation at its off-PGT sales deliverypoints. It is suggested that this clarification apply only to the specifictransportation agreements resulting from the CPN, CNG and WWP sales conversionsand would be implemented by allowing such agreements to be amended to includeoff-PGT points at delivery points and Kingsgate as a receipt point.With respect to the subject PGT transportation certificate, Northwest specificallyrequests clarification that it can tender for transportation under thatauthorization any gas which Northwest is authorized to transport off-PGTdelivery points under its blanket transportation certificate.Northwest alternatively requests that if the Commission declines to makethe requested certifcate clarifications, the Commission amend Northwest'sblanket transportation certificate and/or the PGT-Northwest transportationcertificate to the extent necessary to explicitly authorize Northwest toprovide transportation to off-PGT delivery points under its blanket certificateand to receive transportation service for customer owned gas under thePGT certificate to off-PGT points.Northwest is proposing to use its transportation rights on PGT's systemto allow service to Northwest's historic markets off-PGT to continue incircumstances where those markets would prefer transportation gas to salesgas. Northwest states that this flexibility would also ensure service tooff-PGT markets at times when Northwest may not have system supply salesgas available, or possibly even sales authorization, to service those particularmarkets. Northwest asserts that the requested flexibility is mandatoryto enable service to be maintained to CPN's Klamath Falls market afterthe October 1, 1989, effective date of CPN's 100 percent conversion offirm sales to firm transportation.Comment date: July 11, 1989, in accordance with the first subparagraphof Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">Standard Paragraphs</ITAG>F.
