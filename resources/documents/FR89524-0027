Also includedin the June 30, 1987 submittal were proposed revisions to the followingregulations: COMAR 10.18. 01.01 General Administrative Provisions Definitions;COMAR 10.18 .06.06 General Emission Standards, Prohibitions, and Restrictions-VolatileOrganic Compound Storage and Handling_Applicability and Exemptions, .04Loading Operations in Areas III and IV; COMAR 10.18. 21.01 Volatile OrganicCompounds from Specific Processes Definitions, .02 Applicability, DeterminingCompliance, and Reporting, .13 Miscellaneous Metal Coating, and .15 Paint,Resin and Adhesive Manufacturing and Adhesive Application. These otherrevisions will be addressed in separate Notices.GM-Baltimore is Maryland's only automobile assembly plant. However, thereare three satellite plants which provide specific parts to GM and whichcould also be subject to this regulation.The current federally approved SIP provisions applicable to VOC emissionsfrom automobile and light-duty truck coating installation divides thosecoatings into four categories and imposes the following standards, codifiedat COMAR 10.18. 21.03.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s50,8,8</C><T4>Table </T4>1<H1>Coating</H1><H1>Pounds VOC per gallon of coating applied (minus water)</H1><H1>Kilograms per liter of coating applied (minus water)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Prime coat<D>1.2</D><D>0.14</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Primer surfacer<D>2.8</D><D>0.34</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Topcoat<D>2.8</D><D>0.34</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Final repair<D>4.8</D><D>0.58</D></ITAG></ITAG>COMAR 10.18. 21.13, Miscellaneous Metal Coating, is also part of the federally-approvedSIP and is applicable to certain coatings used in the automotive and light-dutytruck assembly and associated supplier industries. Any miscellaneous metalcoating at these automotive and light-duty truck assembly and associatedsupplier industry facilities which is not regulated by COMAR 10.18. 21.03is covered by COMAR 10.18. 21.13. However, in order for 10.18. 21.13 toapply, the coating must be a miscellaneous metal coating as defined inthe regulation. The following are the federally approved standards formiscellaneous metal coating in Maryland.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s50,8,8</C><T4>Table </T4>2<H1>Coating</H1><H1>Pounds per gallon of coating applied (minus water)</H1><H1>Kilograms per liter of coating applied (minus water)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">High performance<D>3.5</D><D>0.42</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Clear coating<D>4.3</D><D>0.51</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Standard<D>3.0</D><D>0.36</D></ITAG></ITAG>Maryland also regulates all organic compound (VOC) sources in MetropolitanBaltimore and the Maryland portion of the Metropolitan Washington, DC area,which emit greater than 200 lbs/day if built before May 12, 1972 or 20lbs/day if built after May 12, 1972. This generic VOC ``catch all'' regulationis approved as part of the Maryland SIP. Sealers, adhesives and plasticparts coatings are currently subject to the generic VOC regulation, COMAR10.18. 06.06. This regulation requires installations constructed beforeMay 12, 1972 to limit their emissions to less than 200 lbs/day unless theseemissions are reduced by 85 percent or more overall, and for installationsconstructed after May 12, 1972, to limit their emissions to less than 20lbs/day unless those emissions are reduced by 85 percent or more overall.Maryland's proposed SIP revision would require that automotive and light-dutytruck coating installations meet the following standards instead of thoseset forth above in COMAR 10.18. 21.03, 10.18. 21.13 and 10.18. 06.06:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>3<H1>Installation </H1><H1>Maximum VOC </H1><H2>lbs/gal. </H2><H2>kg/l </H2><H1>Installation Maximum VOC Emissions </H1><H2>lbs/day </H2><H2>kg/day</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">A.

The existing SIP has been determined to constitute RACT.Therefore, the revised SIP proposed by Maryland must be at least as stringent.The proposed Maryland regulation divides the coatings used by GM-Baltimoreinto twenty-two different categories with three additional categories forsealers and adhesives. In order to evaluate these requirements againstthe provisions of the existing Maryland SIP, which has been determinedto constitute RACT, EPA here compares these twenty-two categories to thefour automotive and light-duty truck standards set forth in COMAR 10.18.21.03,the miscellaneous metal parts standards codified at COMAR 10.18.21.13,and Maryland's ``generic'' VOC requirements codified at COMAR 10.18.06.06.Table 4 summarizes how EPA compares the present coating categories to thoselisted in the Maryland proposal.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s100,12,r200</C><T4>Table </T4>4<H1>CTG coating category</H1><H1>Applicable MD regulation</H1><H1>Coatings listed in MD proposal</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Prime coat <D>10.18.21.03 </D><D>Body primer</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Primer surfacer <D>10.18.21.03 </D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Topcoat <D>10.18.21.03 </D><D>Body base, Body clear, Body high solids (HS) enamel, Window blackout,Special coatings \1\</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Final repair <D>10.18.21.03 </D><D>Final repair-base, Final repair-clear, Final repair-HS enamel, Specialcoatings \1\</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Miscellaneous metal_high performance coating <D>10.18.21.13 </D><D>Stone chip coating, Chassis, deadener, and underbody coating</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Miscellaneous metal_standard coating <D>10.18.21.13 </D><D>Flexible endcap and bumper-base, Flexible endcap and bumper-clear, Flexibleendcap and bumper-HS enamel, Wheel HS enamel, Special coatings \1\</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Generic VOC regulation (MD) <D>10.18.06.06 </D><D>Plastic parts, coating sealers, adhesives sealer and adhesive primers</D><F>\1\ In accordance with the current Maryland SIP, a ``special coating''would be subject to the regulation for the applicable CTG category. CTG(EPA's Control Technique Guidlines) categories were used by Maryland todevelop the current federally-approved SIP. Under the proposed revisionaddressed here, Maryland departs from the CTG categorization which it originallyaccepted in its SIP and is proposing to specifically define each coatingused. Among other coating definitions, Maryland is proposing to define``special coatings'' as ``a coating other than a normal production colorthat is applied to not more than 35 automobiles and light-duty trucks perday and that does not meet the coating standard in Table 3 of this notice,Sections A-K.''</F></ITAG></ITAG>In reference to Table 4, since GM-Baltimore no longer uses a primer surfacer,the automobile and light-duty truck coating categories that would be affectedby the proposed SIP revision are primer, topcoat, final repair, miscellaneousmetal parts and the processes subject to the generic VOC regulation. Table 4 displays the coating categories set forth in the existing MarylandSIP, states the regulation that corresponds to that category, and liststhe corresponding coating categories from the Maryland proposal. For example,the ``Topcoat'' category in the existing SIP is regulated by COMAR 10.18.21.03,and corresponds to the categories ``Body base'', ``Body clear'', Body HighSolids (HS) enamel and window blackout (HS) enamel in the Maryland proposal.With the exception of Maryland's proposed standards for body primer (electrodeposition),small parts primer (electrodeposition), Final repair-clear, Final repair-HSenamel, and the chassis, deadener and underbody coatings, all the proposedstandards are less stringent than those currently imposed by the federally-approvedSIP for Maryland. Under the existing SIP, all sources subject to the automotive and light-dutytruck and miscellaneous metal parts regulations are required to complywith the applicable standard on a coating-by-coating basis, with the exceptionof topcoat, which must be based on an arithmetic mean of the VOC contentof the coatings available for use in the topcoat spray booth. However,the existing SIP may be interpreted to allow the averaging of colors withina coating line on an instantaneous basis. Maryland has informed EPA thatit interprets the proposed revision to require that each and every coatingmust never exceed the proposed standard. The proposed revision also includesemissions caps which are not presently required in the SIP. The material supporting the Maryland submittal of this proposed revisiondoes not support a finding that this approach will constitute a controltechnology at least as effective as that previously approved by EPA asconstituting RACT. On its face, the Maryland submittal provides for higheremissions from a number of coating categories. Section 172(b) of the CleanAir Act requires that the State provide for the implementation of all reasonablyavailable control measures as expeditiously as practicable, and, in theinterim, requires that the State achieve reasonable further progress ``throughthe adoption, at a minimum, of reasonably available control technology(RACT).'' On May 26, 1988, EPA made a finding of SIP inadequacy for the ozone nonattainmentareas in Maryland, including Metropolitan Baltimore. In response, Marylandis required to submit a new SIP in order to expeditiously demonstrate theattainment of the ozone standard in its nonattainment areas. This submittal also can not be approved as an adequate response to thatfinding of SIP inadequacy because, among other things, it is not accompaniedby any showing that the Maryland ozone SIP, with this revision, can bedemonstrated to provide for attainment of the ozone standard as expeditiouslyas practicable but in no case less than three years from the date of approvalof such (revised) plan. CAA andSection;110(a)(2)(A). <ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion </ITAG>EPA's decision to propose disapproval of this SIP revision regarding surfacecoating for automobile and light-duty trucks and associated satellite industriesis based on a determination that this SIP revision is not consistent withSection 110 and Part D of the Clean Air Act. The public is invited to submit comments, to the EPA Region III addressabove, on whether or not this revision should be disapproved. Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I certify that this action will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. (See 46 FR 8709).Under Executive Order 12291, this action is ``Major.'' It has been submittedto the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52 </ITAG>Air pollution control, Hydrocarbons, Intergovernmental relations, Ozone,Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. <ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>42 U.S.C. 7401-7642. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Date: May 11, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Stanley L.
