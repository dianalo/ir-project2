Much of the recent work, hasbeen directed toward making the fuel cell adaptable to either circulatingacid or alkaline electrolytes. The acid system, although sacrificinga small amount of power output, insures a longer, more stable, lifetime.The acid cell can also use, as direct feed, hydrogen fuels containingrelatively large amounts of carbon dioxide as well as modest levels ofcarbon monoxide. Component lives of 10,000 - 15,000 continuous hoursof stable operation have been logged, while polyelement stacks made fromfull scale components have recently reached levels of continuous operationof about 1500 hours. On the basis of tests underway, the life of theacid cell will be over 2 years, and the alkaline cell over 1 year. Thepower density of a full scale acid cell is presently at 7.4 watts/dm{sup2} with a goal 8.4 w/dm{sup 2}; the alkaline cell at 10.1 watts/dm{sup2} with a goal 12 w/dm{sup 2}. The system modifications needed to reachfull output for both systems are straight forward and readily achievable.Cell assembly procedures have been sufficiently developed in the Frenchpilot manufacturing facility to insure that the device can be mass producedon high speed machinery resulting in unusually low stack costs; i.e.under $50/kw less catalyst. A substantial body of manufacturing costdata to demonstrate this have been developed.</TEXT></DOC>
