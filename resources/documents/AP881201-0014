Several computer security experts said Wednesday that they hadbeen told by Pentagon officials that the network connection wassevered after an unknown intruder illegally gained entry recently toseveral computers operated by the military and defense contractors,according to the Times.   The computer specialists said they thought the Pentagon broke theconnection, which permits military and academic researchers toexchange information, while it tried to eliminate a security flaw inthe computers in the military network, the newspaper reported.   An unidentified spokesman for the Defense Communication Agencytold the Times in a statement that the links between the twonetworks were cut at 10 p.m. Monday and were expected to be restoredThursday.   The Department of Defense apparently acted after a computer atthe Mitre Corp., a Bedford, Mass., company with several militarycontracts, was illegally entered several times during the pastmonth, according to the Times.   Officials at several universities in the United States and Canadasaid their computers had been used by the intruder to reach theMitre computer.   Marcia Cohen, a spokeswoman for Mitre, told the Times Wednesdaythat one of the company's computers had been entered. But she saidno classified or sensitive information had been handled by thecomputers involved and the problem was fixed within hours of beingdetected.   The military computer network, known as Milnet, is linked throughseven gateways to another larger computer network, Arpanet, whichwas jammed last month by a rogue program introduced by a CornellUniversity graduate student.   The decision to disconnect the military computers upset a numberof computer users around the country.   John Rochlis, assistant network manager at the MassachusettsInstitute of Technology, said that a computer user complainedTuesday night that ``he could not send mail.''   ``Initially we were given the run around, but eventually theyunofficially confirmed to us that the shutoff was securityrelated,'' he added.</TEXT></DOC>
