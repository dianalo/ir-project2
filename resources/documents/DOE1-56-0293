This miniature explosion must yield substantiallymore energy than was delivered by the driver. Best current estimatesare the 1-10 MJ of driver energy will be needed and 100-1000 MJ of thermonuclearenergy may be produced by the burning pellet. The Committee has takenas its charge to study ICF efforts with laser or particle beam driverswithin the weapons R and D program. Since heavy ion fusion is supportedprimarily in other DOE programs, it was only briefly reviewed and notgiven much subsequent thought by the Committee. Also, alternative ICFschemes have been considered. The Committee did not attempt to compareICF with other weapons or weapons research programs or with other energyprograms.</TEXT></DOC>
