 Personnel at the various sites were able to reduce theimpact of the invasion and at the same time restore the system tofull strength once the virus was properly treated.andP;  The patch thateventually 'cured' the virus was distributed over the same networkthat generated its damage.andP;  Most of those using the networkreturned to the network after the crisis was over, instead ofover-reacting.andP;  The best way to react to the virus is to remainvigilant for future intrusions and protect the integrity of dataon hand.andP;  Computer security at all levels - hardware, operatingsystem and user interface should be constantly monitored.andP;  Ademonstration of user demand for intensified security will alsoreduce the cost of security devices.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Computer VirusesNetworksSecurityUser BehaviorResponse TimeARPA computer networkAccess Rights.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Believe It or Not, 'Viruses' May Be Good for You!andM;There's been a lot of fuss about the Morris &quot;worm&quot; that recently spread fromthe Massachusetts Institute of Technology via the Internet to 4.3BSD Unixsystems.andP;  Although such worms and viruses may pose a relatively new threat tothe networked computer community, the underlying reason for theirinfiltration--a lack of effective security--is not new at all.andM;Granted, the scientific and technical computing sites' immediate response tothe Morris worm was very effective and professional.andP;  In a way, it was luckythat the worm attacked some of the most sophisticated computing facilities inthe United States because extremely capable systems gurus were on hand toquickly analyze the problem and implement a solution.andP;  The expertise of thesepersonnel was critical to the rapid neutralization of the worm and recoveryof the systems.andM;It was also good that vulnerable systems were pulled from the Internet toprevent the worm from spreading any further.andP;  And I think it says a lot forthe professionalism of the management personnel that the systems werereconnected to the Internet as soon as the worm patch was installed.andM;The unfortunate fallout of this episode is that some organizations have optednot to reconnect to the Internet.andP;  Although there is some risk in beinghooked up to a wide area network (WAN), there are also great benefits.andP;  Forone thing, the same network over which the worm spread also served as atimely transmission channel for the patch that stopped it!andM;If you think a WAN is too much of a &quot;disease risk&quot; for your computers,consider another WAN you use very day--the telephone system.andP;  Having phonesin your organization is risky.andP;  Competitors can tap your lines, and improperuse of the telephone can cost a company a bundle.andP;  But are these problemsserious enough to make you think longer than two seconds about not beingconnected to the telephone network?andM;I know a computer security manager who overreacted to the worm in a big way,even though it really wasn't a threat to his organization.andP;  He initiatedprocedures to have all of the organization's systems removed from theInternet.andP;  He also wanted to prohibit any internal systems from communicatingoutside of his organization!andM;Although there are environments in which these measures might be appropriate,his was not one of them.andP;  None of his organization's systems ran 4.3BSD Unix.andO;Moreover, none of the systems was a host on a network.andP;  The systems simplyused dial-out access for reading and retrieving electronic mail; during theirexternal network connections, the machines acted merely as terminalemulators.andP;  This situation is not what I'd call high-risk.andM;If the security manager had gone ahead and prevented network access, hisorganization would have lost a lot of beneficial information without reallygaining any immunity from invasion by worms or viruses.andM;There are, however, sensible precautions you can take--some immediate, somefor the long haul.andP;  A simple but necessary step is to perform frequentbackups, as Lynn Jarrett suggested in her column on this topic last week.andO;(See &quot;Preventive Proves Best Cure for Computer Viruses,&quot; Digital Review, Jan.andO;30, page 19.)andP;  You should also maintain a long-enough sequence of back-upsets to be able to recover from a slow-acting system contaminant.andM;Some companies have adopted a policy of &quot;quarantining&quot; any outside softwarethat doesn't come right off the shelf: Only commercial products and programswritten by on-site personnel are permitted.andP;  Other organizations are settingup clearinghouse operations to screen software products before installation.andM;A preventive measure that kept the Morris worm from doing any more harm thanit did was the use of security monitoring software.andP;  This type of softwarenotifies the system manager of any strange programs, access by unfamiliarpersons, failed login attempts and so on.andM;I believe that a lot of good can come from the Morris worm escapade.andP;  As webecome more dependent on the power of computer systems and networks, we alsobecome more vulnerable to computer tampering.andP;  The way to cure this is tostress the importance of computer security at all levels: hardware, operatingsystem, applications, and user interfaces.andM;In the past, manufacturers thought that only the Department of Defense had toworry about computer security, so they designed secure systems only forDefense Department applications.andP;  Because of this limited market segment,security features on systems have traditionally been extremely expensive.andO;But if non-Defense Department computer buyers and users band together to showvendors that they also want secure systems and networks, we'll see asignificant increase in reasonably priced security products.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
