Some Citibank customers in the New York area were beingtold this week of the cut in their NOW checking accountbalances, effective Dec. 1, to 2% from 4%. The Citicorp unitis also lowering its rate on Holiday Club deposits to 4% from5.5%, also effective Dec. 1.</LP><TEXT>   The moves, which only affect New York area customers, willoffset a reduction of rates in several consumer lendingcategories, including auto and installment loans, which takeeffect later this month, a Citibank spokesman said.   NOW accounts -- or negotiated order of withdrawal accounts-- were introduced in the early 1980s as a way for banks tocounter the impact of money-market mutual funds, whichoffered checking privileges.   The NOW account rate reduction caught other New Yorkbankers by surprise. &quot;That's quite a drop, &quot; said DennisKosovac, senior vice president of consumer lending atChemical Bank, of the move by Citibank. He said his bank hasbeen reducing its NOW rate in step with lower money-marketrates, but &quot;this to me seems out of the realm of amarket-rate move.&quot;   Robert Hutchinson, managing director in charge of retailmarketing at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., said he knowsof no other bank in New York or the country that has slashedits NOW account rate to anywhere near the 2% level.&quot;Obviously,&quot; he said, &quot;we will look at what goes on in themarket&quot; in determining if Manufacturers Hanover will followsuit. This week, the bank lowered its Holiday Club paymentrate to 4.25%.   The Citibank spokesman said customers were being told theycould earn a better return by switching checking accountbalances into the bank's insured money-market fund or amutual fund. Citibank offers its own brand of mutual funds,Landmark, and funds managed by others. He said NOW accountstypically had yielded about half the money-market rate. Butlately that spread has narrowed considerably as money-marketrates have come down sharply.   &quot;We held the line as long as we could,&quot; the spokesmansaid. &quot;We couldn't hold it any longer, given the way ratesare moving.&quot; Messrs. Hutchinson and Kosovac said their banksare able to earn money with their NOW accounts paying 4%.   Citibank's deposit rate reduction could usher in otherrate cuts, said Robert Heady, president of Bank Rate Monitor.&quot;Banks want to protect their profit spreads as they comeunder pressure to bring lending rates down,&quot; he said. Thisweek, he noted, rates on certificates of deposit came down atmore banks around the nation than has been the case formonths.   The average interest-bearing checking account around thenation pays 4.49% and in New York the average among largebanks and thrift institutions is 4.36%, with several savingsinstitutions offering rates above 5%, according to Bank RateMonitor.   Citibank will most likely widen its profits on NOWaccounts because those customers will accept lower ratesrather than shift funds to a money market or mutual fund, sayother bankers. They note that consumers tend to keepchecking-account assets separate from liquid investments,which are used for more discretionary spending. Moreover, inorder to take advantage of higher yields on deposits,customers would have to take the extra step of switchingfunds from a linked fund into their checking account.   The Citibank spokesman disagreed, saying the number ofchecking account customers who have opted in the past forlinked services is what encouraged the bank to make the ratereduction. &quot;Customers can of course remain with the NOWaccount, but our insured money-market fund is now yielding4.5%,&quot; he said.   Customers, of course, might also opt to shift to anotherbank to receive a higher NOW account yield. But bankcustomers tend to be loyal and avoid the trouble of opening anew banking relationship over fees or rates, consultants say.   Citibank's NOW accounts represent about 15% of the bank's1.5 million consumer accounts. But it probably counts for amuch higher percentage of the bank's consumer deposits sinceNOW account customers tend to maintain high balances.</TEXT></DOC>
