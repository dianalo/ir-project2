Hungarian officials said 16,000 more East Germans had arrived inHungary by way of Czechoslovakia. It was not known how many of themmight be joining the exodus West.   The West German newspaper Die Welt reported Tuesday that about10,000 East Germans may have crossed into the West on Monday on thefirst day of the westward trek.   Jubilant East Germans rushed to telephones to tell relatives backhome they'd finally made it to West Germany.   Bavarian officials got ready for further waves of East Germanemigres en route from Hungary.   Border officials in Austria said more than 5,700 refugees crossedinto their country with hours of daylight left. Officials of a WestGerman charity running the refugee camps in Budapest said the lastbus left Monday afternoon, leaving the camps empty. About 7,000 EastGermans had been registered there.   A Hungarian Interior Ministry official said 26,000 of theestimated 60,000 East Germans in Hungary _ most of them vacationers_ had returned home Monday, but about 16,000 others had arrived inHungary via Czechoslovakia.   ``I decided on escaping 27 years ago, and today it worked. It's afeeling that's just tops, just wild,'' said a 40-year-old Leipzigman after crossing into West Germany at Passau.   Single people, couples and families with children and babies madethe journey from Hungary to West Germany _ by bus, rickety sedans ormotorcycle.   ``We did not really plan to come here, but when we heard aboutthe opening of the (Hungarian-Austrian) border, we decided this wasa chance,'' said 20-year-old Volkmar Windt, who crossed into WestGermany on a small East German-made motorcycle along with his twinsister, Katrin.   Many refugees were cheering and shouting as they reached Bavariaunder the blaze of television lights, while their children playedwith teddy bears handed out by relief workers. Couples kissed intheir cars.   Some tumbled out of compact cars packed with people and flashedvictory signs after crossing into West Germany.   It was the greatest flood of East German refugees since 1961, theyear the Berlin Wall halted the flow to the West.   Hungary's action marks the first time a Warsaw Pact country hasaided an exodus of refugees from an allied communist nation. EastGerman leaders expressed outrage at the Hungarian government, andstate news media accused it of ``organized smuggling of humans.''   In Moscow, the Soviet news agency Tass condemned Western mediafor what it called a ``tendentious campaign'' to spur illegal EastGerman emigration. Tass also said that foreign West Germandiplomatic missions illegally protect East German refugees andsupply them with West German documents.   Several hundred East Germans, seeking safe passage to the West,are now holed up in West Germany's embassy in Prague, Czechoslovakia.   It was not known how long the exodus of East Germans out ofHungary would last. News reports said the East Germans mightrestrict travel to Hungary in retaliation, but the government deniedthe reports.   ``I have this feeling that I have missed the last train to theWest,'' a worried student in East Berlin told The Associated Press.Other East Berliners interviewed Monday, all speaking on conditionof anonymity, expressed the same fear.   The exodus came after weeks of talks between the two Germanysfailed. On Sunday, the Hungarian government formally announced itwould allow all East Germans to leave for West Germany.   It was not clear how many East Germans would emigrate.   East German refugees arriving in West Germany said their journeyfulfilled their dreams.   ``For us there is only the future and it will be good,'' said amiddle-age East German husband and father of two children, who wouldnot give his name.   Chancellor Helmut Kohl, during a speech in Bremen, said thatuntil East Germany adopts reforms, West Germany will be seen as amecca for unhappy East German citizens.   In Washington, State Department deputy spokesman Richard Bouchersaid the United States welcomed the Hungarian action.   ``We also commend Austria for its help and support and we admirethe efforts of the Federal Republic to offer a home to fellowGermans seeking freedom,'' he said.   After crossing into the West, the refugees lined up to registerwith West German charities and border authorities.   As parents stretched, filled out forms or cupped hands aroundcontainers of coffee handed out by volunteers, their children linedup in the morning mist for the teddy bears, picture books and otherdonated playthings.   But most arriving Monday opted to drive on to relatives in citiesas far away as Hamburg, more than 350 miles from the border.   About 6,000 East Germans had already fled to the West this summerthrough Hungary, which with Poland is gradually liberalizing whileneighboring East bloc governments are resisting the freer climatefostered by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   In Yugoslavia, about 100 Romanians who have fled from theirCommunist country gathered Monday at a U.N. office in Belgrade,applying to be resettled in the West.   As the migration took place, West German news media reported thatEast German leader Erich Honecker, who supervised the Berlin Wall'sconstruction, was in failing health.   The ZDF television network quoted Western diplomatic sources inHungary as saying Honecker's medical condition ``has deterioratedconsiderably.''</TEXT></DOC>
