<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-08-0677 </DOCNO><TEXT>The effects of viscosity on the resonance absorption of incompressibleMHD surface waves, which occurs when the waves are supported by a thintransition layer rather than by a discontinuous surface, are considered.The behavior of the plasma and fields inside the transition layer isconsidered, allowing for classical viscosity. An inhomogeneous Airy equationfor the velocity component along the propagative direction is obtainedin the vicinity of the resonant field line. The viscous stress tensorfor a magnetized plasma is considered, and a simple algebraic steadystate equation is obtained for the velocity component along the backgroundmagnetic field. The net heating rate is evaluated and found to be independentof the viscosity coefficient, and to correspond to the surface wave decayrate obtained from ideal MHD equations. 28 references.</TEXT></DOC>
