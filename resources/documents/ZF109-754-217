 In 1988, CCITT improved andextended the original standard.andM;&quot;One of X.400's real values is that it appears to be the only viable andindustry-accepted interoperability vehicle for electronic mail,&quot; said SteveFrankel, president of Retix, a software firm in Santa Monica, Calif.andP;  &quot;Itwill clearly be followed by other important applications, X.500, inparticular, and file transfer.&quot;andM;According to Jamie Lewis, editor of the Clarke Burton Report, Salt Lake City,&quot;X.400 is the most widely accepted part of OSI.andP;  From a broad perspective,OSI.andP;  acceptance depends on many factors, and X.400 adds a positive note tothe overall situation.andP;  It answers a need for global communications that isbecoming a big part of the international marketplace.&quot;andM;Mark Stieglitz, director of marketing at Retix, said, &quot;You can actually useit right now on many platforms.andP;  X.400 is incredibly well accepted, with abreadth of support unmatched by other OSI products.andM;&quot;Our OpenServer 400 product for end users in frequently used to provide agateway to X.400 environments.andP;  But I foresee an expanding role for thispackage in the future, whereby users delve further into the richfunctionality enabled by X.400.&quot;andP;  (See Fig.andP;  1.)andM;Industry observers generally attribute three distinct phases to the emergenceof open systems.andP;  Phase one began in the late 1970s, and reached intensityduring the middle to late 1980s.andP;  This was the period of conceptual growth,technology and protocol development by groups such as the American NationalStandards Institute (Ansi), CCITT, International Organization forStandardization (ISO), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST),and Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE).andM;During this period, standards such as the X.25 for wide-area networks (WANs)and the 802.n for local-area networks (LANs) were developed.andP;  A handful ofproducts became available toward the end of this phase.andM;The second phase of open systems began approximately in 1989, and continuesto this day.andP;  Projected to prevail through 1992, this is the era of &quot;cautiousimplementation.&quot;andM;Due to the continuing scarcity of commercial products, particularly thoseassociated with OSI, open system configurations are scattered and pioneeringin nature.andP;  However, numerous X.400 installations provide a measurement ofprogress.andP;  And the federal Government OSI Profile (Gosip) mandate gives ofOSI further momentum.andP;  Effective last August, Gosip requires that all networkacquisitions by the federal sector must specify OSI protocols for systemsinteroperability.andM;By 1993, the third phase of OSI deployment will be in full swing, assignificant quantities of commercial products arrive in the marketplace.andP;  Thepromise of worldwide interoperability--the ultimate payoff of opensystems--will emerge.andP;  Application services based on X.400/X.500 standardswill be featured prominently.andM;Even in the current phase of OSI implementation, one product has achievedwidespread acceptance: the CCITT X.400 Message Handling System (MHS) forinteroperable electronic mail services.andM;Numerous technology vendors have adopted X.400, including IBM, DigitalEquipment Corporation, Hewlett-Packard, ATandamp;T, Xerox, Sun Microsystems, TouchCommunications, Retix and many common carriers throughout North America andEurope.andP;  Vendors offering value-added X.400 services are also entering thisarena.andM;A recent study by Frost and Sullivan, New York, indicates that the market forelectronic mail and services is growing rapidly, with a total gross revenueof $1.2 billion expected by 1992.andP;  Much of this growth will be based onimplementation of the X.400 standard, which will serve primarily as astore-and-forward backbone between private mail facilities, although largehost systems may choose to use it directly.andM;Large host systems will flourish in serving the unique needs of variousorganizations, but X.400 will frequently function as the interoperabilityvehicle among nonstandard, private electronic mail packages.andM;Ron Hoffman, a network manager at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,Cambridge, Mass., reported that existing mail offerings will probably notchange quickly in the U.S.andP;  academic environment.andP;  &quot;Most people in academiautilize IP [Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)]networks.andP;  X.400 typically operates in an OSI configuration, although thereis no absolute mandate to this.andP;  Interest does exist in gateways to the X.400world, but we don't have that facility here at present,&quot; he said.andM;Lewis of the Clarke Burton Report said private and X.400 mail systems willcomplement each other.andP;  &quot;LANs will continue to employ their own mailpackages.andP;  X.400 will not replace cc:Mail, for example, in localenvironments.andP;  It is not practical for everyday use in that setting, at leastfor the next four to five years.andP;  X.400 as a store-and-forward backbone willprosper, particularly in large organizations.andP;  Smaller firms will eventuallyuse X.400 gateways to enhance their in-house mail capabilities,&quot; he declared.andM;Any discussion of OSI must acknowledge the dominance of the TCP/IP networkprotocols in providing multivendor system performance.andP;  There is a segment ofthe marketplace that believes TCP/IP configurations will continueindefinitely as the preferred solution, preventing OSI from gaining wideacceptance.andM;There are some indications that OSI is overcoming this acceptance hurdle.andO;The first is user acceptance.andP;  As more commercial products become available,most with vastly improved functionality versus their TCP/IP counterparts,demand for OSI capabilities will rise steadily.andM;Another development providing a major impetus to OSI acceptance is the Gosipmandate by the federal government.andP;  There have been and will continue to bewaivers from this policy for special situations, but longterm direction hasbeen decreed; OSI will ultimately supplant TCP/IP in federal installations.andO;As the world's largest buyer of technology services, the government's &quot;putyour money where your mouth is&quot; move to OSI provides a tremendous incentiveto commercial product development.andM;Corporate productivity gains derived from OSI application services,particularly electronic mail, offer another boost to its acceptance.andP;  Therapid implementation of X.400 products is one of OSI's greatest strengths.andO;It offers what users are seeking: solutions to real problems in a workingenvironment.andP;  It is not just an esoteric debate about technologicalsuperiority, but presents a viable solution to the problem of linking allthose private mail systems in the marketplace.andP;  It, along with standardizeddirectory services as documented in X.500, presents a completeinteroperability vehicle.andM;A veteran toiler in open networking issues, Dan Lynch, president of InteropInc., Mountain View, Calif., advises TCP/IP installations to &quot;keep a sharpeye on what the OSI committees are doing.&quot;andP;  He reported that &quot;X.400, the'battleship Galactica' of electronic mail facilities,&quot; is in the field.andM;&quot;Unlike TCP/IP's electronic mail system, which was designed for passingnotes, X.400 can handle anything from databases to graphic, digitizedphotographs, financial transactions and even voice.andP;  Moreover, it has anexcellent directory services capability [X.500] that makes it a truly globalbusiness facility,&quot; declared Lynch.andM;&quot;Ultimately, the battle between TCP/IP and OSI will not end with a bang, buta whimper.andP;  As developers keep extending TCP/IP, the two networksincreasingly become functional equivalents.andP;  Over the next decade, mostTCP/IP users will migrate, and whatever network we wind up with will simplybe called OSI,&quot; he said.andM;Historically speaking, X.400 owes much of its basic concepts and terminologyto the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization(Unesco).andP;  In 1979, the International Federation for Information Processing(IFIP), which is part of Unesco, created working group 6.5 to study thetechnology of computer-based message systems (CBMS).andP;  Much of their preceptsand phraseology prevail to this day in the X.400 arena.andM;By 1981, the CCITT formed a follow-up working, or rapporteur, groupidentified as Q5/VII.andP;  This committee developed the initial standards forCBMS, or message-handling system operations, which CCITT ultimately ratifiedin 1984.andP;  CCITT, as part of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU),also had links to the United Nations.andM;CCITT ratified eight standards (called recommendations) in 1984.andO;Collectively, they are entitled X.400 (1984).andP;  Individually, they containmultiple recommendations.andP;  (See Fig.andP;  2.)andP;  Because all were bound in redcovers, they are often referred to as the Red Book.andP;  This version of X.400 isstill heavily utilized.andM;CCITT works on a four-year cycle.andP;  In preparation for the 1988 update toX.400, a new rapporteur group, designated Q33/VII, was formed in 1985.andP;  Itworked to improve and extend the original 1984 standard set.andM;The resulting product, X.400 (1988), also contains multiple recommendationsthat replace the 1984 standards.andP;  Many of the original specifications offeredsuch broad applicability that they have been applied to other OSI standardsgroupings.andP;  Bound in blue covers, the 1988 edition is often cited as the BlueBook.andM;Producing a set of technical standards, no matter their innate quality andprecision, is not sufficient to ensure widespread usage, however.andP;  Operatingprofiles that ensure interoperability must follow.andP;  For X.400, organizationsthat have developed such profiles include NIST in the U.S., the EuropeanCommittee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CEN/CENELEC) and the EuropeanConference of Postal and Telecommunications Administration (CEPT).andP;  Althoughtheir respective functional profiles differ slightly, they can allinteroperate when installed in the field.andM;CompuServe Inc., Columbus, Ohio, is in the process of implementing an accessto X.400 for its clients.andP;  David Kishler, supervisor of corporatecommunications, offers some insights as to its complexity.andP;  &quot;We haveproceeded slowly on X.400,&quot; said Kishler.andP;  &quot;It is a complex development, notone to be installed overnight.andP;  It is, of course, very popular and has beenembraced by many companies, but requires careful introduction to ourenvironment where we already support MCI Mail, Internet transmissions, LANmail interfaces and numerous corporate packages.andP;  Our X.400 offering shouldbe available to users seeking that service very early in 1991.andP;  The nature ofthat service will undoubtedly evolve over time as the standard itselfchanges,&quot; he added.andM;The initial X.400 standard deals with two types of messages: interpersonalmessages (or memos) and electronic data interchange (EDI) messages amongbusiness systems.andP;  The latter provides the primary business justificationsfor employing X.400 products and services.andP;  Enterprises transmittingdocuments, such as contracts, proposals, sales orders and purchase orders,can do so electronically with EDI, thereby reducing costs and dramaticallyimproving service.andP;  CCITT will integrate EDI standards into the 1992 updateto the X.400 service.andM;The model for X.400 consists of five main elements (see Fig.andP;  3):andM;* Originators and Recipients (O/R) represent human users or machineprocesses.andM;* User Agents (UA) is software that generates messages for each O/R.andM;* Interpersonal Message System (IPMS) is the collective whole of all the UserAgents.andM;* Message Transfer Agents (MTA) are systems that store-and-forward messages.andM;* Message Transfer Systems (MTS) is the collective whole of all the MTAsworldwide.andM;The MHS functional model thus consists of a single MTS that supportsstore-and-forward communications between any number of users (O/Rs).andP;  Eachuser is serviced by a User Agent, which provides translation between existingproprietary user interfaces and local office automation environments and theX.400 standard formats/procedures that support worldwide, vendor-independentinformation transfer.andP;  The UAs can then transmit their standard formattedmessages to mailboxes that interface to an MTA.andP;  Each MTA is similar to anindividual post office.andP;  The MTS represens the entire postal system.andM;Each message traversing the MTS comprises two parts: an envelope and itscontents.andP;  The envelope contains information needed by the MTS to transfer,and subsequently deliver, a message to the UA of the user for whom it isdestined.andP;  This information is primarily supplied by the Originator whensubmitting the message to its UA for transmission.andM;The content of the message contains random binary data as far as the MTS isconcerned.andP;  It essentially represents transparent data to the transmittingsystems.andP;  Thus, many different types of information can be sent throughoutthe MTS.andM;One particular application standardized by X.400 is called InterpersonalMessaging.andP;  The content of a message consists of either an inter-personalmessage (IPM) or an inter-personal notification (IPN).andP;  The IPM is like anelectronic memo, whereas an IPN corresponds to an acknowledgment of a memo'sreceipt by its receiver.andP;  There is a specific data communication protocolthat supports this form of X.400 activity.andM;Several data communication protocols enables physical implementation of theMHS functional model.andP;  In the 1984 version, they are:andM;* Message Transfer Protocol (P1)--standardizes message transfer among MTAs.andM;* Interpersonal Messaging Protocol (P2)--standardize the format of IPMs andIONs, thus specifying the interaction of UAs within the MTA when performingInterpersonal Messaging.andM;* Message Submission and Delivery Protocol (P3)--standardizes messagesubmission and delivery between UAs and MTAs.andM;Another concept important to X.400 is Management Domains (MD): the sum totalof computerized message-handling systems within an organization.andP;  An MDcomprises two types: Administration Management Domain (ADMD) and PrivateManagement Domain (PRMD).andP;  An ADMD is a public messaging service offered by aconventional telecommunications company.andP;  A PRMD is an in-house systemoperated for a firm's own purposes.andP;  These concerns become particularlyimportant when dealing with issues of naming and message routing.andM;The 1988 version of X.400 added several important features, such as theincorporation of security provisions.andP;  Utilization of an X.500 directory formanipulating X.400 user information has been made available.andP;  An abstractservice model more closely attuned to client/server activity is present.andP;  Useof the full OSI protocol stack has been added.andP;  And support for autonomousmailgrams is another new features.andP;  These and other elements havesignificantly strengthened X.400 (1988).andM;Looking ahead, X.400 (1992) promises equally important upgrades.andP;  Some of thework now under way includes support for EDI, updating the MHS conformancetests to acknowledge new features and implementation of applicationprogramming interfaces (APIs) for software developers.andP;  Other additionscenter on specifications for character sets, voice-messaging service,preparation of an Implementors Guide and group communications procedures forelectronic bulleting boards and the like.andM;&quot;Future end users will employ more of the functionality inherent with X.400,&quot;explained Retix's Stieglitz.andP;  &quot;They will move beyond basic messaging andbegin to utilize many of the sophisticated features now being added to thestandard.andP;  &quot;The addition of X.500 directory services alone offers greatlyexpanded capabilities to users of X.400.andP;  These represent complex softwareproducts that will require time for end users to assimilate into their dailyoperations,&quot; he said.andM;It is clear that X.400, in conjunction with its corollary X.500 standard, isthe predominant OSI vehicle in use today.andP;  Its widespread acceptance seems toensure it will retain that role for the indefinite future.andM;Acceptance Builds for X.500andM;Goal is a universal directory serviceandM;The X.500 standard for Directory Services, also referred to as namingsystems, global naming and distributed directory services, is a jointdevelopment effort by the International Consultative Committee for Telephoneand Telegraph (CCITT) and the International Organization for Standardization(ISO).andP;  Although the titles for such a service vary, they all refer to thesame basic functionality: providing a methodology to name network resources,perform name lookup and maintain a global compendium of users and resourcesacross a distributed environment.andM;As a universal accepted standard, X.500 will be employed with increasingfrequency throughout this decade, particularly in conjunction with the X.400Message Handling System (MHS).andP;  The X.500 standard will also find otheravenues of important use, such as in network management and configurationsecurity.andM;&quot;X.400 without X.500 Directory Services is painful,&quot; declared Jamie Lewis,editor of the Clarke Burton Report, which tracks networking trends out ofSalt Lake City.andP;  &quot;They are intricately linked since X.400's native facilitiesare awkward to use, not intuitive in linking names and resources,&quot; heexplained.andM;Despite X.500's relative lack of maturity, products compliant to the standardshould be available in a year or two.andP;  X.400, on the other hand, has beendocumented as an official standard since 1984, and only recently haveproducts become available, particularly where LAN environments are concerned,he added.andM;The 1988 version of MHS utilizes the X.500 Directory for naming andaddressing, authorization and security, distribution list expansion andanalysis of recipient resource capabilities.andP;  Even though the current X.500version is freshly minted, its core components are settled enough to beconsidered stable.andP;  It is unlikely that any major upheavals will occur withthe existing standard, although technological improvements will be addedthrough the years as user needs dictate.andM;Some vendors have debated the applicability of X.500 in all environments.andO;Its usefulness within a LAN configuration, for example, has been questioned.andO;Its implementation in that constricted setting may incur unacceptableoverhead, according to some observers.andM;Perhaps the major role for X.500 will be found, much like the X.400 scenario,as an intermediary between local directory services.andP;  Most of the prevailingprivate capabilities in this area will endure.andP;  The mission for X.500 will beto bridge the gap between private directory services, making true globaldistributed systems possible.andM;Early signs indicate that X.500 is beginning to influence proprietaryproducts.andP;  There is a talk of &quot;X.500-like&quot; features.andP;  This trend shouldcontinue, although private solutions will always have their place.andP;  Twocommercial products at the forefront of naming services are Street Talk, fromBanyan Systems, Inc., Westborough, Mass., and NetWare Name Service, fromNovell, Inc., Provo, Utah.andM;Standards groups traditionally progress slower than private enterprisesbecause of their voluntary nature.andP;  Eventually, some of the advanced featuresfound in the private products may be incorporated into the internationalstandard.andP;  Whatever their level of harmonization, however, X.500 will assumean increasing role as a universal directory service, able to interface tomultiple private systems.andM;Cashin is a writer, lecturer and advisor kn software and communicationissues.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
