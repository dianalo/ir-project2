<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-25-0909 </DOCNO><TEXT>Methods of crystal opics and infrared spectroscopy were used to studypeculiarities of synthesis under irradiation and in plasma of the followinginorganic compounds: complex oxides (NiCr/sub 2/O/sub 4/, NiAl/sub 2/O/sub4/ spinels, NiFe/sub 2/O/sub 4/ ferrite, (Fe, Cr)/sub 2/O/sub 3/ solidsolution) and model compound of Na/sub 2/MgSiO/sub 4/ orthosicate. Synthesiswas conducted by three methods: solid-phase sintering in the air at 600...1500deg C, in plasma of electric arc plasmotron and under accelerated electronbeam. Conducted investigations showed that synthesis of complex oxidesunder electron irradiation achieved the maximum at the temperature by200...300 deg C lower as compared to the temperature of synthesis inthe furnace. Oxide interaction in plasma during short period of timealso results in preparation of complex compounds. Correlation of synthesisconditions in plasma and under electron beam irradiation enables to considerthat reactions of spinel and ferrite formation in binary oxide systemsNiO-Cr/sub 2/O/sub 3/, NiO-Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/, NiO-Fe/sub 2/O/sub 3/,Fe/sub 2/O/sub 3/-Cr/sub 2/O/sub 3/ under acelerated electron beam proceedat lower temperatures. This testifies to the fact that processes of radiationinduced diffusion affect sufficiently synthesis procedure, besides thermaleffect. 7 refs.; 4 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
