This program is consistent with, and part of,a government-wide effort to increase the availability of advanced researchinstrumentation in universities and colleges. For FY 1990, the appropriationrecommended in the conference report for the Energy and Water DevelopmentAppropriations Bill is $5.0 million. In anticipation of enactment of thisbill, DOE invites all qualified universities to write for a copy of itsUniversity Research Instrumentation program solicitation, DOE-ER-0184/5,Notice of Program Announcement Number DOE-PS05-90ER755534. Selection foraward under this solicitation is subject to the availability of funds.<ITAG tagnum="84">Principal Research Areas</ITAG>While all areas of energy research are eligible, in FY 1990 the URI program'sfunds will be concerned primarily with capital equipment costing $100,000or more needed for on-campus research in one of five specific energy areas(listed below in alphabetical order).

Theinstrument's utility in advancing other areas of scientific or technicalresearch is of peripheral interest during the application's review procedure.<ITAG tagnum="84">Eligibility and Limitations</ITAG>Participation in the URI program is limited to U.S. universities and collegesthat currently have active, ongoing DOE-funded research support (includingsubcontracts) totalling at least $150,000 in value in the specific areafor which the equipment is requested during the past two fiscal years (October1, 1987 to September 30, 1989).DOE is establishing this limitation to ensure that the instrumentationacquired with these grants will significantly expand the research capabilityof institutions which have already demonstrated the capability to performlong-range energy research. The Office of Energy Research believes thatrestricting eligibility to institutions which have performed $150,000 ofDOE supported research over a two-year period will limit eligibility inthis grant program to those institutions which, because of their existingcommitment to energy research, are best able to incorporate advanced instrumentationinto their research programs. Special consideration will be given to HistoricallyBlack Colleges and Universities (HBCU's) which meet the institutional eligibilitycriteria, and have significant research capabilities in the selected researcharea. DOE will consider only requests for larger instruments, costing about$100,000 or more, which are required to advance reearch in the designatedarea. Smaller research instruments (less than $100,000 each) will not beeligible for consideration in this program. General purpose computing equipmentis also not eligible under this program. However, laboratory computersand associated peripherals dedicted for use directly with the instrument(s)in the selected area may be considered. Computer equipment for theoreticalresearch will be eligible under this program, but will be given secondaryconsideration relative to instrumentation for experimental research.<ITAG tagnum="84">Application Forms</ITAG>Program solicitations are expected to be ready for mailing by October 1,1989.
