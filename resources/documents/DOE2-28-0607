The {sup 239}PuO{sub 2}aerosols were monodisperse with activity median aerodynamic diametersof 0.75, 1.5, or 3.0 microns. The plutonium particles produced protractedalpha irradiation of the lungs. Ten dogs had specific initial pulmonaryburdens (IPB) of 330 to 4100 kBq of {sup 239}PuO{sub 2}/kg of body mass.The average onset time of clinical signs of lung injury was 3 years afterexposure; the average time from the onset of signs until cardiorespiratoryfunction evaluation was 5.5 years. A second group of 10 dogs had IPBof 110 to 2000 kBq of {sup 239}Pu/kg of body mass but no signs of lunginjury. A third group of 10 dogs, not exposed to {sup 239}Pu, were matchedfor age and sex. Cardiopulmonary function tests were performed. Onlythe dogs in group I with signs of lung injury had a mild respiratoryfunction disorder consisting of smaller lung volumes, reduced compliance,increased respiratory frequency and minute volume, and reduced carbonmonoxide diffusing capacity. Cardiac function of all three groups wassimilar. These findings indicate that alpha irradiation of the lungsof man could produce restrictive lung disease at long times after initialexposure.</TEXT></DOC>
