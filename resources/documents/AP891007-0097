Vanessa Vadim, 21, was released on her own recognizance Saturdaymorning after a brief appearance in Manhattan Criminal Court, whereshe pleaded innocent to misdemeanor charges.   Her mother did not attend the hearing, but the two were reunitedat a Manhattan hotel after Ms. Vadim's release, a publicist said.   ``Vanessa has not been charged with possession of any illegalsubstance. The charges against her, basically, are for interferingwith someone else's arrest,'' said a statement from Ms. Fonda readto The Associated Press by publicist Stephen Rivers.   ``Vanessa is a good daughter, a serious student of whom I amvery proud, and I stand behind her through this,'' Ms. Fonda said.   The daughter's attorney, Robert I. Kalina, predicted ``afavorable resolution of this matter.''   Ms. Vadim had attended the premiere of her mother's new film,``Old Gringo,'' just hours before her arrest Friday morning oncharges of obstructing governmental administration, loitering forthe purpose of purchasing drugs and disorderly conduct.   Police said the arrests occurred at a decrepit building officerswere monitoring in a buy-and-bust operation that netted 11 othersuspects Friday.   Her boyfriend, 22-year-old Thomas Feegal, was charged withcriminal possession of a controlled substance _ two plastic bagsbelieved to contain heroin _ and possession of a hypodermic needle,said police spokesman Sgt. Peter Sweeney.   ``The whole thing is really sad. These are affluent people whoshould have everything going for them, and they come down here toshoot down their lives like this,'' said narcotics unit Capt.Stephen Nasta.   The couple told police they were buying the drugs for a collegestudy on narcotics use, Nasta said. Nasta, citing the 8 a.m. arresttime and Feegal's possession of a needle, said he did not believethat story.   Ms. Vadim is a student at Brown University in Rhode Island andFeegal attends New York University.   Ms. Fonda, who attended the movie premiere with her daughter,canceled a scheduled trip to Europe after the arrest and remainedin New York, an associate said.
