Reagan, in a five-minute call to Col. Tom Carroll of the AlaskaArmy National Guard, said he was ``very concerned'' about theplight of the mammals and wanted an ``on-site report'' from Alaska.The conversation was piped into the White House press room.   The endangered California gray whales became trapped 18 milesnortheast of Barrow, Alaska, while migrating south to warmerwaters. The 24-to-30-foot-long mammals were bleeding and batteredfrom continually bashing into the jagged ice for nearly two weeks.   Reagan said he had monitored the situation by watchingtelevision.   ``I just wanted to tell you that everybody down here, theirhearts are with you and our prayers are also with you,'' he toldCarroll, who was at a base camp at Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, about 200miles southeast of the whales.   ``Anything that we can say or do to help you along with thesuccess of the operation, we'd be pleased to do it,'' the presidentadded.   Carroll explained to the president details in the plannedoperation in which a National Guard Skycrane helicopter was to towa 185-ton Hovercraft-type ice-breaking barge from Prudhoe Bay tothe whales.   The operation was delayed for several hours because the ownerwanted to make sure it was totally safe to operate in the harshenvironment, Carroll said.   He said that while the National Guard is coordinating theoperation, private companies and groups such as Greenpeace and theNational Marine Fisheries Service are also involved.   ``It's extremely moving when you see the interest that has beengenerated not only here but across the nation,'' Carroll said.   He added that Reagan's call was a morale-booster for the crewsworking in sub-freezing weather.   ``This is the kind of thing that kind of makes it allworthwhile,'' he said. But the big moment will come when the whalesare safe, he added.</TEXT></DOC>
