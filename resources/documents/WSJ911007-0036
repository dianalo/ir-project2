Airbus presented its first A340 -- the largest plane ithas yet built. The four-engine jetliner, able to fly as manyas 295 passengers for more than 7,000 miles nonstop, will bein direct competition with Boeing Co.'s 777 and McDonnellDouglas Corp.'s MD-11.</LP><TEXT>   Makers of the three wide-body planes are competing forwhat is expected to be a lucrative market: long-range routeswith insufficient passenger traffic to justify use of thejumbo Boeing 747.   Already, Airbus has orders for 117 A-340s and options for93 more. And the jetliner itself has yet to make its firsttest flight, which is scheduled for later this month. Theplane sells for about $100 million each. Deliveries areexpected to begin in January 1993, with the first one takenby Lufthansa AG.   The development of the A-340, together with its sisterplane, the twin-engine A-330, has prompted the U.S. toescalate its dispute with the European Community oversubsidies. The U.S. has accused the governments of France,Spain, Germany and Britain of subsidizing the companies thatdevelop the Airbus planes: British Aerospace PLC,Aerospatiale of France, Deutsche Airbus, a unit of Germany'sDaimler-Benz AG, and Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A. ofSpain.</TEXT></DOC>
