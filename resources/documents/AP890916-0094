But the Hungarian premier said theborder would remain open.   Premier Miklos Nemeth was quoted by a West German newspaper assaying that concern for human rights had dictated his country'sdecision to defy its Warsaw Pact ally, East Germany.   Using Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's concept of a``European House'' where East and West cooperate, Nemeth was quotedas telling Bild am Sontag: ``There can be no rooms in such a housethat are separated by barbed wire.''   An estimated 14,000 East Germans have traveled to West Germanysince Hungary threw open its western border with Austria on Sept.10. East Germans, who have automatic West German citizenship, havebeen drawn by the promise of a brighter economic future in the West.   Hungary had insisted its approval of the East German exodus istemporary but has not said when it would close its border. Nemethwas quoted as saying that the border would remain open but did notsay for how long.   Ferenc Somogyi, one of Hungary's three deputy foreign ministers,also said Friday his government had no immediate plans to halt thewestward flow.   Border officials in West Germany said 500 East Germans had madetheir way to registration points in Bavaria during the night Friday.   In Budapest, workers of the West German charity registering newarrivals at refugee camps said about 400 East Germans had gatheredbetween late Friday and noon Saturday.   That is nearly double the average in the last few days. Theworkers, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the refugeescontinued to fear that the border might close and their opportunityto emigrate would end.   Many East Germans waiting at the Zugliget transit camp for busesto take them to the West expressed anxiety.   ``Grab the chance while you can, you never know how long youhave,'' said a burly man from Berlin, cradling a two-year oldtoddler in his arms. ``I could never live with myself if I missedthe opportunity because I waited too long.''   East Germans began crossing the border into Austria after Hungarybegan removing boundary fortifications in May, a reflection of itsdesire for stronger ties to the West. It also has been implementingreforms that put it, along with Poland, at the forefront of changein the Soviet bloc.   Foreign Minister Gyula Horn sought to head off speculation thatHungary's reforms and tensions with allies might lead it out of theWarsaw Pact.   ``As long as this bloc exists, Hungary will continue to carry outits responsibilities in it,'' Horn told a Communist Party rally inKomarom, on the Czechoslovak border.   In July, thousands of the estimated 50,000 East Germansvacationing in Hungary refused to return home. Hungary began puttingthem up in emergency shelters.   Then, seven days ago, Hungary threw open its border and allowedthe biggest single exodus West since the Berlin Wall was built in1961.   Hard-line East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Romania have sharplycriticized their Warsaw Pact ally's role in the refugee exodus.   Romanian President Nicolae Ceausescu on Friday accused Budapestof ``irresponsible actions'' and called for ``interference in othercountries' home affairs to stop,'' the state Agerpres news agencyreported.   On Saturday, the Soviets lashed out at West Germany. A front-pagearticle in the Communist Party daily Pravda said ``It's completelyobvious that the carrying out of a huge provocative action againstEast Germany is an open violation of international law.''   Pravda also accused the West German press of whipping upenthusiasm among the refugees to emigrate.   The Czechoslovak Communist Party daily Rude Pravo also assailedWest Germany, accusing that government of having ``coordinated'' theexodus and saying Bonn authorities were ``unable to hide theirhatred of socialism.''   Communist East Germany kept up its bitter criticism of BonnSaturday. ``We are experiencing now a pitiless psychological warfareagainst socialism,'' read a commentary in the Berliner Zeitungnewspaper.   The state-run news agency ADN alleged that the recruitment ofEast German workers amounted to ``slave trade.''   In a twist to the refugee story, an Italian newspaper saidSaturday that several hundred unemployed Italians are seekingpermission to live and work in East Germany.   The Rome-based daily Il Tempo said a delegation representing 264unemployed people from Naples went to the East German Embassy Fridayto deliver documents asking for permission to move to the Communistcountry, where they were certain they would be able to find a securejob and an inexpensive place to live.</TEXT></DOC>
