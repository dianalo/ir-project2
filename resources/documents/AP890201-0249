The Harvard Business School adds a required course inethics.   As tales of fraud in Chicago's commodities pits and the largestsecurities fraud scandal ever ring out a decade marked by sleaze ingovernment and business, ethics is being touted as an antidote toimmorality.   ``A subject like ethics is always important but becomesparticularly deserving of emphasis at a time when you seem to have astrong streak of greed running through people's emotions,'' saidBoris Yavitz, a professor of public policy and businessresponsibility at Columbia University's business school.   In one of his first acts, Bush appointed a panel to recommendethics reform in government. The move indicates Bush wants to erasethe legacy of the Reagan administration, in which 100 officials wereaccused of unethical behavior.   Thornburgh _ who replaced Edwin Meese III, himself accused ofwidespread unethical acts _ said Tuesday the government will createspecial task forces and hire more investigators targeting securitiesand commodities fraud.   ``They want to get credibility back in the financial markets andthey're going to enforce all the rules and regulations to give themarkets back to the public,'' said Jack Barbanel, a futures analystwith Gruntal andamp; Co.   At the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board ofTrade, a two-year federal inquiry has raised allegations that asmany as 100 brokers and traders systematically cheated customers outof millions of dollars.   In New York, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. recently agreed to pleadguilty to six felonies and pay a record $650 million in thelargest-ever securities fraud probe.Michael Milken, whose pioneeringwork in high-yield bonds thrust Drexel to the forefront of thesecurities industry, is expected to be indicted soon.   Financial and government officials predict the latest moral andlegal transgressions will trigger reforms such as stiffer jail termsand fines for white-collar lawbreakers.   Both the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission are upfor federal reauthorization this year, and Congress is expected tobe under pressure to give the agencies greater police power.   Some changes may be apparent already. For example, the Drexelfine was 6{ times larger than any previous securities fraudsettlement.   And on Jan. 19, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange fined one tradera record $625,000 and his wife _ also a trader _ $125,000 forprearranging deals. Both were expelled.   In an attempt to reassure viewers that its brokers are ethical,investment giant Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. is airing televisioncommercials that conclude with the message ``A Tradition of Trust.''   Most Wall Street brokerage houses now require new employees tosign agreements saying they understand company policies on thehandling of sensitive or confidential information.   Since reports of endemic insider trading surfaced in 1986 and ledto the conviction of speculator Ivan Boesky, brokerage firms havemoved to frequently emphasize guidelines. Newly hired collegegraduates are indoctrinated about behavior deemed immoral or illegal.   ``We've updated computer surveillance of transactions to providefaster and more accurate warning signs of trading and brokerageactions within the firm,'' said Peter Roche, a spokesman for MorganStanley andamp; Co., where a 24-year-old junior analyst last year wasprosecuted for insider trading.   The North American Securities Administrators Association, whichrepresents state securities regulators, wants to require thatbrokerage firms tell new clients whether a stockbroker has committedany violations.   ``That would turn up the heat considerably in terms of people inthe industry knowing that information about them wasn't just goingto stay in some file or computer chip in Washington but is there onthe table in front of the customer,'' NASAA spokesman Scott Stapfsaid.   Business schools such as Harvard's, which instituted an ethicsclass last fall after receiving a $20 million endowment from formerSecurities and Exchange Commission Chairman John Shad, are teachingstudents that every business decision has social repercussions.   ``Schools are responding to it because businesspeople arepressuring them to,'' said David Vogel, a professor at theUniversity of California at Berkeley's School of BusinessAdministration. ``The private sector cares very much about this.''   IBM Chairman John F. Akers, writing in the current issue of aMassachusetts Institute of Technology Sloan School of Managementpublication, said ethical instruction is fine _ but should begin inkindergarten.   ``If an MBA candidate doesn't know the difference between honestyand crime, between lying and telling the truth, then businessschool, in all probability, will not produce a born-again convert,''Akers said.</TEXT></DOC>
