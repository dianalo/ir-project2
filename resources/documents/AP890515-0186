The Pentagon says pressure crushed the bomb and thenuclear material dissolved.   In a report Friday, the Pentagon said the 1-megaton bomb couldnot have detonated at the time of the accident ``because the systemwas designed not to arm or receive an arming command under thisaccident circumstance.''   The Defense Department told Japan in the four-paragraph report``there is no environmental impact'' from the dissolved nuclearmaterial, which it said would have settled quickly to the oceanfloor 16,000 feet below.   It did not specify the material in the bomb, but when details ofthe accident were disclosed last week in Washington, researcherWilliam Arkin at the Institute of Policy Studies said it held 33pounds of plutonium.   That estimate was revised Monday to 5.5 pounds, said ShannonFagan of the environmental group Greenpeace, which worked on theproject with Arkin.   An A-4 Skyhawk carrying the bomb slipped off the aircraftcarrier Ticonderoga in 1965 about 80 miles off an inhabited islandin Okinawa prefecture in far southern Japan. The locationpreviously had been kept secret.   Japan, the only country ever attacked with nuclear weapons, isespecially sensitive on nuclear matters. In addition to thequestion of radiation, the newly revealed accident raises the issueof whether the United States sidesteps the Japanese ban on nuclearweapons within its territory.   At the time of the accident, the Ticonderoga was said to bebound for the U.S. naval base at Yokosuka at the mouth of Tokyo Bay.   Keizo Obuchi, the chief cabinet secretary, was asked byreporters Monday whether the ship had docked at Yokosuka. Hereplied: ``We have no confirmation at present, but we are inquiringnow.''   Japan's anti-nuclear policy was not proclaimed until 1968, threeyears after the accident.   Foreign Minister Sousuke Uno told a parliamentary committeeJapan accepts the U.S. evaluation that the material poses noenvironmental danger, but said an investigation was necessary toallay public fears.   Later Monday, the Foreign Ministry appointed experts fromseveral agencies to evaluate the U.S. report and decide whethermore studies were needed. The experts are from the Defense Agency,coast guard, Environmental Agency and fisheries authority.   News of the lost bomb brought out demonstrators who demandedelimination of nuclear weapons and an end to the U.S.-JapanSecurity Treaty, under which about 60,000 U.S. military personnelare based in Japan.   The Japan Congress Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, whichsupports the opposition Socialist Party, said the United States was``making fools of the Japanese.''   A statement by its secretary-general, Koichi Akamatsu, said thegovernment should ban all U.S. ships and planes unless they arecertified as not carrying nuclear weapons. The U.S. Navy refuses tosay whether its vessels carry nuclear arms when they enter Japanesewaters.   Monday was the 17th anniversary of the U.S. turnover of Okinawato Japanese rule. The occasion was marked by peace rallies on theisland, which was the scene of heavy fighting in World War II.   Japanese TV showed thousands of people listening to anti-nuclearspeeches.   The Pentagon report responded to a request by Japan forclarification after reports of the accident. A copy was provided toThe Associated Press on Monday.   It said nuclear weapons specialists from the U.S. NationalLaboratories had tested the nuclear material by dissolving it insea water.   ``Because of its high density, the solute would have settledvery quickly to the floor of the ocean along with othersedimentation,'' it said. ``Therefore, there is no environmentalimpact.''   It said the bomb was not designed to remain intact under theheavy pressure of great ocean depths and the nuclear material wouldhave leaked out of the crushed casing.</TEXT></DOC>
