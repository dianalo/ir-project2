DALE NELSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Scientific researchers in American universitiesshould be required to disclose financial relationships with industrythat might create conflicts of interest, a congressionalsubcommittee was told Tuesday.   ``Biomedical science has been intensely commercialized withinuniversities over a relatively short period of time,'' said SheldonKrimsky, associate professor of urban and environmental policy atTufts University. ``I have heard it said within the scientificcommunity that everyone gains from this marriage of academia andcommerce. Nothing can be further from the truth.   ``Not only are there losses, but some of these losses threatenthe integrity of our scientific institutions and weaken publicconfidence in science.''   Krimsky said that at least 45 per cent of the biomedical facultyat Harvard, as an example, have formal affiliations with 36biotechnology companies.   He called for disclosure of financial interests related toresearch being conducted by scientists applying for grants.   Dr. George D. Lundberg, vice president for scientific informationof the American Medical Association, cautioned, however, thatbarring researchers from working in areas where they had a financialinterest ``would be devastating, and we would lose many qualifiedpeople and we would lose much information that would have come fromthose people if they had worked.''   ``A lot of things motivate human beings, and money's one of thebig ones,'' Lundberg said.   He said that if he had been a journal editor in 1905 looking forsomebody to write an article on automobiles, he would have askedHenry Ford.   ``Would Henry Ford have been in conflict of interest? Totally,''he said. ``Would I care? No. I'd love that. He'd know the most aboutit.''   David Noble, a professor of history at Drexel University who issuing the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on grounds that hewas fired for speaking out against conflicts of interest, saiduniversity researchers ``are free to make undisclosed arrangementswith private corporations in which they often have equallyundisclosed personal roles.''   ``They are free to shape and profit from the public investment inresearch and many have done so,'' he said. He argued that suchcollaboration between universities and industries should beaccompanied by ``proper disclosure and procedural safeguards.''   Noble criticized MIT's Industrial Liaison Program, in which hesaid firms pay a membership fee to the institution and gain accessto research publications and other information.   He told the subcommittee that ``nearly all the membercorporations of the ILP were multinationals with no necessaryallegiance to the United States, that fully half of them wereforeign, that 57 of them were major Japanese competitors, and thatthe ILP had for nearly a decade been operating an overseas salesoffice in downtown Tokyo.''   Paul E. Gray, president of MIT, told the panel that theinstitution ``would not operate this program were its only benefit astream of revenue.''   ``The educational and research functions of this science-baseduniversity require broadly-based understanding of industrialpractice and industrial needs,''Gray said. ``The ILP is an importantvehicle for developing that understanding, and this is its principalbenefit to the institute.''   Patricia K. Woolf of the Woodrow Wilson School at PrincetonUniversity, agreed that such arrangements can be beneficial but saidthe subject needs further study.   Dr. David Blumenthal, senior vice president of Brigham andWomen's Hospital in Boston, said that ``academic researchinstitutions must insist on disclosure of relationships withindustry that may create economic conflicts of interest.''   Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., chairman of the human resourcessubcommittee of the House Government Operations Committee, said, ``Iam sure that many Americans will be justifiably outraged by some ofthe ways that federally funded scientific data are being sold, ormanipulated for personal gain.''   Rep. Larkin Smith of Mississippi, the ranking Republican on thepanel, said Congress should ``send a strong signal to the researchcommunity that scientific misconduct will not be tolerated.''   At the same time, he said, ``A careful balance must be struckbetween avoiding conflicts of interest and achieving scientificbreakthroughs that ultimately could benefit millions. We should notallow limited or individual cases of misconduct to stand in the wayof overall progress.''</TEXT></DOC>
