At the time of application,commuter airworthiness requirements were not incorporated into Part 23and certification for 12 passenger airplanes would require Part 25 airworthinessstandards. The commuter category airworthiness requirement which permits a seatingconfiguration, excluding pilot seats, of 19 or less, was incorporated intoPart 23 by amendment 23-34, which became effective February 17, 1987. ClaudiusDornier then made a new application for U.S. type certificate on July 31,1987 for Part 23 commuter category. The Dornier Seastar Model CD-2 is a high wing twin-engine amphibian airplanewith turboprop engines that are mounted on the center-top of the parasolwing in a tandem push-pull arrangement. The airframe structure utilizescomposite materials. The maximum gross weight is 10,141 lbs. with a seatingconfiguration of 12 passengers. <ITAG tagnum="84">Type Certification Basis </ITAG>The type certification basis for the Dornier Seastar Model CD-2 airplaneis as follows: Part 21 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR), andSection;21.29; Part 23 of the FAR, effective February 1, 1965, including amendments23-1 through 23-34; Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) No. 27,effective February 1, 1974, as amended by amendments 27-1 through 27-6;Part 36 of the FAR, effective December 1, 1969, as amended by amendments36-1 through amendment effective on the date of type certification; exemptions,if any; and any special conditions resulting from this notice. <ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion</ITAG>Special conditions may be issued and amended, as necessary, as part ofthe type certification basis if the Administrator funds that the airworthinessstandards designated in accordance with andSection; 21.17(a)(1) do not containadequate or appropriate safety standards because of novel or unusual designfeatures of an airplane. Special conditions, as appropriate, are issuedin accordance with andSection; 11.49, after public notice as required byandSection;andSection; 11.28 and 11.29(b), effective October 14, 1980, andwill become part of the type certification basis, andSection; 21.17(a)(2).The proposed type design of the Seastar Model CD-2 airplane contains anumber of novel or unusual design features not envisaged by the applicablePart 23 airworthiness standards. Special conditions are considered necessarybecause the airworthiness requirements of Part 23 do not contain adequateor appropriate safety standards for the novel and unusual design featuresof the Seastar Model CD-2 airplane. <ITAG tagnum="84">Composite Structure</ITAG>The airframe of the Seastar Model CD-2 airplane is made of composite materialand is assembled differently from the typical semi-monicoque aluminum airframesthat have been predominant since the early 1940's. Composite materialsof the type used on the Seastar Model CD-2 airplane are generally not susceptibleto initiation of fatigue cracks by the application of repetitive loads,but are susceptible to damage in the form of cracks, breaks, and delaminationsfrom intrinsic and discrete sources growing under application of repetitiveloads. Because of this and other factors, the FAA has determined that thefatigue requirements of andSection; 23.572 are inadequate to assure thatcomposite material structure can withstand the repeated loads of variablemagnitude expected in service.The use of advanced composite materials and extensive bonding of thesematerials in primary flight structure is a novel and unusual design featurewith respect to the type of airplane construction envisaged by the existingairworthiness standards of Part 23. Because the requirements of Part 23do not require the level of substantiation necessary for composite materialstructure, a special condition is proposed to include the necessary airworthinessstandards as a part of the type certification basis for the Seastar ModelCD-2 airplane. This special condition is proposed to ensure that a levelof safety exists for airplanes made from bonded composite materials equivalentto those existing for aluminum airplanes.The proposed special condition will require composite structural componentscritical to safe flight be evaluated by damage tolerance criteria. Thedamage tolerance consideration includes principal structural elements,such as the fuselage, and the vertical and horizontal stabilizers, andtheir carry-through structure, since failure of these structures couldhave catastrophic results. When damage tolerance is shown to be impractical,the proposed special condition is worded to permit approval, based on safe-lifetesting. Metal detail designs may continue to be evaluated to the fatiguerequirements of andSection; 23.572.Damage tolerance criteria for composite structure, in combination withthe existing material requirements of Part 23, such as andSection;andSection;23.603 and 23.613, will provide a level of safety for the composite materialairframe structure used in the Seastar Model CD-2 airplane equivalent tothat required by the airworthiness standards of Part 23.In addition to those components requiring fatigue/damage tolerance evaluations,other components that are critical to flight safety, such as movable controlsurfaces and wing flaps, must also be protected against loss of strengthor stiffness. Protection conventionally is provided through design andinspection. Since composite material strength is susceptible to manufacturingdefects and damage from discrete sources, including lightning strikes,process controls and inspectability are limited; therefore, structuresdesign must provide for these limits with adequate protection allowances.The lack of adequate service experience with composite material structuresin airplanes type certificated to the airworthiness standards of Part 23,the unusual mechanical properties characteristics, and the experience withcomposite material structural bonding, to date, necessitate proposing specialconditions to assure an appropriate level of safety for the Model CD-2airframe structure. These proposed special conditions are intended to require:(1) Accounting for environmental effects, i.e., temperature and humidityon material mechanical properties in all structural substantiation analysesand tests; (2) limit load residual strength with impact damage from discretesources; (3) ability to carry ultimate load with realistic intrinsic anddiscrete impact damage at the threshold of detectability; and (4) designfeatures to prevent disbonds greater than the disbonds for which limitload capability has been shown. Proof-testing of each production componentto limit load and reliance on manufacturing quality control proceduresbetween limit and ultimate load may be used in lieu of design featuresprovided each bonded joint is subjected to its critical design limit loadduring the proof-testing. Acceptable non-destructive testing techniquesdo not yet exist in state-of-the-art composite technology to reliably identifyweak bonds. However, proof-testing of each production article may be discontinuedif such tests are developed and accepted by the FAA.Because the composite material and bonding may require preventive maintenanceand inspection procedures different from those commonly utilized for existingaluminum airframes, the proposed special condition requires that instructionsfor continued airworthiness be established in addition to those requiredby andSection; 23.1529.<ITAG tagnum="84">Lightning Protection</ITAG>The regulations incorporated by reference include standards for protectionfrom damage to the structure of the airplane by lightning (andSection; 23.867)and from ignition of fuel vapor (andSection; 23.954). These standards donot provide the level of safety for the electronic system installed incomposite airframe structures which provide less electromagnetic shieldingthan metal skins. For airplanes employing the extensive use of compositematerials, the lightning produced voltage and currents could increase substantiallyand additional protecting design features should be installed. These systemscan be susceptible to disruption to both the command/response signals andthe operational modes as a result of direct lightning strike attachmentor electrical and magnetic interference. To ensure that a level of safetyis achieved equivalent to that of existing aircraft that utilize a metalstructure, a special condition is being proposed which requires that thesecomponents be designed and installed to preclude component damage and interruptionof function due to both direct and indirect effects of lightning.<ITAG tagnum="84">Protection From Unwanted Effect on High Energy Radio Frequency (RF)Fields</ITAG>Traditional airplane designs which utilize metal skins and mechanical controlsystems had inherent design features which provided protection and wereless susceptible to the effects of RF energy from ground-based transmitters.There is a trend toward increased use of composite structures that do notprovide the RF shielding normally provided by metal skins and electricaland electronic systems to perform critical and essential airplane functions.Therefore, the effective measures against the effects of high energy radiofrequency fields must be provided for by the design and installation ofthese systems. The primary factors that have contributed to this increasedconcern are: (1) The increasing use of sensitive electronics that performcritical and essential functions; (2) the reduced electromagnetic shieldingafforded airplane systems by advanced technology airframe materials; (3)the adverse service experience of military airplanes which use these technologies;and (4) the increased number and power of radio frequency emitters andexpected future increases.In showing compliance with the regulations for protection against hazardscaused by the exposure to high energy radio frequency fields, electricaland electronics systems which perform critical and essential functionsmust be considered. The hazards addressed include those which would resultin a catastrophic failure condition to the airplane. Failures that wouldbe a hazard to the airplane, but not catastrophic, are considered underandSection; 23.1309. To prevent the occurrence, airplane systems which performcritical functions must be designed and installed to ensure that the operationand operational capabilities of these critical functions are not adverselyaffected when the airplane is exposed to high energy radio fields. Airplanesystems which perform essential functions must be protected to ensure thatessential functions can be recovered after the airplane has been exposedto the high energy radio frequency fields. Manual mode reversion is consideredan acceptable method of retaining the essential functions. Reliance onredundancy as a means of protection against the effects of external RFfields is generally insufficient since all elements of a redundant systemare likely to be exposed to the fields concurrently.No universally accepted guidance to define the maximum energy level inwhich civilian airplane system installations must be capable of operatingsafely has been established. At this time, the FAA and other airworthinessauthorities are working to establish an agreed RF energy level representativeof that to which the airplane will be exposed in service. These specialconditions require that the airplane be evaluated under an interim standardfor the protection of the electronic system and its associated wiring harness.<ITAG tagnum="84">Location of the Engines and Propellers</ITAG>Part 23 envisions propellers located forward of the wing and other aircraftsurfaces that may shed ice. On the Seastar Model CD-2 airplane, the propellersare located above and aft of the forward portion of the fuselage and oneis a pusher propeller located aft behind the parasol wing and both engineexhaust systems. Ice shed by the wing, wing struts, forward fuselage, orother parts of the airplane may have adverse effects on the propellers.In addition, the effects of exhaust gases impinging on the aft propellermust be evaluated. A special condition is proposed requiring propellerice and exhaust gas impingement protection.Since the location of the propellers on the Model CD-2 is an unusual designfeature, passengers, crew, and ground personnel may be less aware of theproximity of the propeller blades. Propeller disc conspicuity is of concernduring ground operation. Therefore, a special condition is proposed torequire the necessary visibility of the propeller discs.The location of the engines on the Seastar Model CD-2 airplane will preventthe pilot from quickly visually determining if an engine is operating.A special condition is proposed to require a positive means to indicateto the pilot when an engine is inoperative.<ITAG tagnum="84">Effects of Water in Hull Compartments</ITAG>The Seastar Model CD-2 is an amphibian airplane with several watertightcompartments in the hull area. To ensure that the proper weight and centerof gravity is maintained, it is necessary to provide a means for determiningthe amount of water in the watertight compartments. The Airplane FlightManual or other approved manual material must describe the means for determiningthe effects of the water in the compartments for safe operation of theairplane. A special condition is proposed requiring means to determinethe presence and quantity of water in the hull compartments.<ITAG tagnum="84">Emergency Flotation Equipment</ITAG>The commuter category requirements did not envision an amphibian airplanedesigned to operate a considerable time near or over water areas. For thelevel of safety envisioned for the commuter category, such airplanes mustinclude emergency flotation means for each occupant, unless the airplaneis restricted to operating over water bodies of such size and depth thatlife preservers or other flotation means would not be required for survivalof occupants during emergency landing and emergency evacuation.The Seastar Model CD-2 airplane is expected to operate extensively overlakes, rivers, and other bodies of water. In the case of an emergency,this may lead to an inadvertent water landing in water too deep to safelyevacuate without appropriate emergency flotation equipment.In response to Public Law (Pub. L.) 100-223, entitled ``Airport and AirwaySafety and Capacity Enhancement Act of 1987'', enacted December 30, 1987,the FAA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) entitled ``ImprovedSurvival Equipment for Inadvertent Water Landings'' (53 FR 24890; June30, 1988). This NPRM proposes to amend FAR Parts 121 and 135 to require,among other things, adequate life preservers and flotation devices forpassengers, including small children and infants, on flights of an aircarrier which the Secretary of Transportation determines will occur partlyover water.The FAA anticipates that these proposals will be adopted essentially asproposed and has determined it is appropriate to propose a special conditionfor the Seastar to require flotation equipment that will provide the levelof safety expected for a commuter category amphibian airplane in over wateroperation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Federalism Implications</ITAG>The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effectson the states, on the relationship between the national government andthe states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion</ITAG>In view of the design features discussed above, the following special conditionsare proposed for the Dornier Seastar Model CD-2 airplanes under the provisionsof andSection;21.16 to provide a level of safety equivalent to that intendedby the regulations incorporated by reference. This action is not a ruleof general applicability and affects only the model/series of airplaneidentified in these special conditions.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Parts 21 and 23</ITAG>Aircraft, Air transportation, Aviation safety, Safety.The authority citation for these special conditions is as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> Secs. 313(a), 601 and 603 of the Federal Aviation Actof 1958; as amended (49 U.S.C. 1354(a), 1421, and 1423); 49 U.S.C. 106(g)(Revised Pub.
