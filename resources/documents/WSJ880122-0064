McCarthy (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> GLD WX </CO><IN> TNM ELE ARO </IN><G> DEF </G><TEXT>   Gould Inc. agreed to sell a chunk of its defense business for much less than it had hoped, disappointing Wall Street and forcing most of a $115 million charge the company said it will take for the fourth quarter.    Gould said it agreed in principle to sell its torpedo business to Westinghouse Electric Corp. for about $100 million and said it is talking with several parties about the sale of its division that makes underseas surveillance systems for the Navy. But the company said proceeds from those sales should be at least 25% less than what it had expected -- not enough to offset the losses and costs of the other defense operations that will be divested.    Wall Street wasn't pleased. Gould's stock dropped $1.25 in New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, closing at $11.25.    &quot;It's disappointing,&quot; said Julian Menear, an analyst with the Pershing andamp; Co. division of Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities. &quot;If they had expedited the negotiations they wouldn't have had to accept 25% less in price.&quot;    Said H.P. Smith, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., &quot;The sale price is particularly disconcerting given the fact that the company had been indicating there were a large number of companies expressing interest in this business.&quot;    Gould has been trying for 17 months to sell its defense businesses, and still has its large NavCom Systems unit and several smaller lines to sell. Gould said it wanted to shed the units to reduce debt and focus on its computer, industrial automation and electronic product businesses.    The company blamed the stock market crash for recent delays in the sale process and for the low prices it expects to get. &quot;Equity values and the premiums being paid for acquisitions had been severely depressed,&quot; the company said. But, as reported earlier, some former executives have said the sales were delayed by indecision in Gould's executive suite -- a claim Gould has denied.    Westinghouse said the purchase of Gould's division will give it a major share of the Navy's torpedo business. The Pittsburgh-based electrical products maker, defense contractor and broadcaster recently won a contract to supply the Navy with surface- and air-launched torpedoes.    Rolling Meadows, Ill.-based Gould said it and the Navy have agreed to cancel a NavCom radio contract that has been in dispute, which should help Gould sell the division, analysts said. But Gould is still seeking $150 million from the government in that and other disputed projects.    Of the $115 million planned fourth-quarter charge, $15 million is related to expenses of some industrial units that Gould discontinued several years ago. Gould said it expects to report that fourth-quarter earnings from continuing operations were &quot;well over&quot; the $5.5 million, or 12 cents a share, reported a year earlier. </TEXT></DOC>
