The satellite, Spacenet III, owned by GTE Corp., fired itsapogee kick motor, a small rocket engine, at 11:57 a.m. EST, some90 hours after its launch Friday night by a French Ariane rocket.   GTE officials said the 1,562-pound Spacenet III would initiate astabilizing spin Tuesday night. This will lock its antennae intocontact with Earth. Once that is accomplished and verified, thesatellite will deploy an array of solar power cells that providethe craft with electricity.   GTE engineers will conduct a series of tests of the craft andthe the satellite will start operations early in April.   Spacenet III provides a communications link between points inall 50 of the United States. Clients include The Associated Pressand the television groups of ABC, CBS, CNN and Gannett.
