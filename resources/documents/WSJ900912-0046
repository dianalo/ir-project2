But last spring, thearthritic, 83-year-old widow became another casualty of thelong-distance industry's battle for customers.   A telemarketer called Mrs. Olt at home. All he wanted, hesaid, was to save her some money on her long-distance phonecalls by switching her service to MCI Communications Corp.from American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.</LP><TEXT>   Annoyed by yet &quot;another salesman,&quot; Mrs. Olt says, she hungup on him. But when her next phone bill arrived from NewJersey Bell, it showed a $5 charge from &quot;some outfit calledthe MCI.&quot;   In phone-industry parlance, Mrs. Olt had been &quot;slammed.&quot;   She thus joined tens of thousands of telephone customersaround the nation who claim their phone service has beenswitched without their consent. Apparently the MCI salesmanhad authorized New Jersey Bell, the local phone company thatcontrols the connection to her house, to route all herlong-distance calls through MCI's lines instead of ATandamp;T's.   MCI denies that it would slam a customer, and it contendsthat it received oral approval for service from Mrs. Olt. Itadds that her service has subsequently been switched back toATandamp;T. &quot;It is not in our best business interests to slamanybody,&quot; says John Worthington, MCI's chief counsel. He addsthat two months ago the company moved to clean up itstelemarketing by moving the people who verify customer ordersout of locations where sales calls are made and takingsupervisory responsibility for verifiers away from salesmanagers.   Last year, in any case, at least 100,000 phone customerscomplained to local phone companies that their long-distancecarrier had been switched without authorization. BellAtlantic Corp., the regional Bell company that owns NewJersey Bell, says slamming complaints that it received rose74% from 1988 to 1989, to between 60,000 and 70,000. BellAtlantic says that these totals reflect only verifiedincidents and that the figures don't include switches due toclerical errors or some other misunderstanding.   The Federal Communications Commission and consumerwatchdogs say the problem is getting worse. Untold thousandsmore consumers have been slammed but don't even know it ordidn't complain, phone-company executives and consumer groupssay.   &quot;It's outrageous,&quot; says Richard M. Kessel, executivedirector of New York State's Consumer Protection Board. &quot;Noone should be switched without getting a full disclosurebeforehand and without signing a form that shows they agreeto the full terms and conditions of the change.&quot;   Customers plagued with extra charges and aggravationaren't the only ones paying for slamming. Local phonecompanies, the first place most customers call when they havea phone problem, are spending millions processing thecomplaints. Those costs increase the pressure on local rates.Moreover, ATandamp;T says slamming is costing it millions ofdollars, not only in lost revenue but also for processingcomplaints from consumers who still think ATandamp;T runs thenation's phone system.   &quot;It's been happening for the last couple of years, but itreached a crisis stage in 1989,&quot; says Merrill Tutton, vicepresident of consumer services at ATandamp;T. However, ATandamp;T's 70.4%share of the long-distance market still far exceeds the 15.4%for MCI and the 10.5% for US Sprint, a UnitedTelecommunications Inc. subsidiary.   Mr. Tutton says the biggest culprits are ATandamp;T's longtimerival, MCI, and companies that help sell its service. The FCCagrees but says ATandamp;T isn't blameless.   At the FCC, Kathie Kneff, chief of the informal-complaintsbranch, says slamming complaints increasingly cite MCI, &quot;butwe get complaints about other carriers, too, including ATandamp;T.&quot;In the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 1989, slamming complaintsto the FCC were: Sprint, 154; MCI, 140, and ATandamp;T, 29. In thecurrent fiscal year, complaints so far total: MCI, 387;Sprint, 194, and ATandamp;T, 22. However, most complaints don't goto the agency.   Sylvia Rosenthal, executive director of Washington-basedTele-Consumer Hotline, says more than 90% of the slammingcomplaints it receives involve MCI and other rivals of ATandamp;T.&quot;Once in a while, you'll get a complaint about ATandamp;T, but it'smostly because of a clerical error,&quot; she says.   MCI says it is capturing about 100,000 ATandamp;T customers aweek. But Mr. Tutton says that when ATandamp;T asks its formercustomers why they left, more than 20% of those contacted saythey didn't know that they had given up ATandamp;T service.   Last January, ATandamp;T sued several of its rivals, includingMCI and its 25%-owned telemarketer, Pioneer TeleTechnologiesInc., demanding they stop slamming. ATandamp;T's complaint chargedMCI with fraud and deception, including telling ATandamp;Tcustomers that ATandamp;T was going out of business and that MCIwas a part of ATandamp;T. No trial date has been set in the suit,which was filed in the federal district court in Newark,N.J., and has been moved to the district court in Washington,D.C.   Both MCI and Pioneer, of Sergeant Bluff, Iowa, have deniedany wrongdoing, but a Pioneer spokesman says the company hashired Arthur Andersen andamp; Co. to audit its verificationprocedures.   &quot;It's true we're being blamed more than anyone else,&quot;MCI's Mr. Worthington says. &quot;But we're making moretelemarketing calls than anyone else.&quot; ATandamp;T, he complains,&quot;is wrapping itself in consumer clothes. But all it's got atheart is its own commercial interests.&quot;   &quot;What would you do if somebody was stealing yourcustomers?&quot; Mr. Tutton replies.   Consumer groups say slammers prey especially on theelderly, the hard-of-hearing and people with languageproblems. Ken McEldowney, executive director of ConsumerAction in San Francisco, says most of the complaints fieldedby his organization and its affiliates in California are fromthe elderly and Mexican-Americans. James Thompson,consumer-affairs director of the American Association ofRetired People, says he is &quot;astounded by the number of peoplethat have been ripped off by this.&quot; Fielding a recentinquiry, he counted 270 letters complaining of slamming thensitting on his desk.   &quot;What this clearly shows is that MCI and others aregetting desperate in their battle with ATandamp;T for marketshare,&quot; says Jack B. Grubman, an analyst at PaineWebber Inc.&quot;These tactics could backfire&quot; with customers.   Slamming has become most acute in the past two years ascompetition in the long-distance phone industry has heated upand the players are consolidating. ATandamp;T, trying to stemerosion of its market share, is spending tens of millions ofdollars on ads that tell customers to get promises of deepdiscounts from its rivals in writing.   US Sprint is counterattacking with ads that say, &quot;Lightenup, ATandamp;T.&quot; MCI is waging a telemarketing blitzkrieg; it saysit is calling some seven million prospective customers amonth.   Long-distance phone companies needn't present the localphone company with a customer's written authorization to turnon service. The order is accepted by telephone with theunderstanding that the long-distance company will produce asigned form from the customer authorizing the change if acustomer disputes it.   Like most phone customers, Mrs. Olt didn't know all this.She says she still doesn't understand the changes stemmingfrom ATandamp;T's breakup in 1984.   ATandamp;T's long-distance phone rivals deny that they switchcustomers without permission. Some customers give oralapproval and then neglect to sign a form that thelong-distance carrier sends them to confirm their decision toswitch. Others say consumers' ignorance about how theindustry operates is causing confusion.   &quot;This is something we're extremely concerned about,&quot; saysJohn Hoffman, Sprint's senior vice president for regulatoryand legislative relations. &quot;Our {slamming} numbers arerelatively low. The fact is long distance is verycompetitive, and people don't expect this.&quot;   After ATandamp;T's breakup, the FCC ordered local phonecompanies such as New Jersey Bell to provide ATandamp;T's rivalswith equal connections to their local networks. This way,customers wouldn't have to dial a cumbersome access code toreach an ATandamp;T competitor. Under this &quot;equal-access&quot; program,customers could tell their local phone company whichlong-distance carrier they wanted. Now, more than 90% of U.S.phone customers have equal access to all carriers.   (Customers who didn't notify the local company of theirpreference were put into a pool and automatically assigned toa carrier based on the carrier's share of the regionalmarket. So, if MCI had 10% of the customers in the market,10% of the pool was assigned to MCI. Some customers who hadignored repeated bulletins from their phone companies aboutthe change were later surprised to find that they had beenassigned to another carrier.)   Consumer watchdogs and regulators say the spread of equalaccess has made it easier for ATandamp;T's rivals to use theslamming techniques, while still playing on customerconfusion -- and apathy.   Several big local phone companies, such as Bell Atlanticand BellSouth Corp., were deluged with slamming complaintslast year. Thousands of businesses such as nightclubs and gasstations have also been complaining that the long-distanceservice they chose for their pay phones was switched withoutauthorization.   The Baby Bells and other big phone companies, such as GTECorp., provide service to millions of customers. So, thepercentage of complaints relative to their overall businessesseems small. Jan Peters, executive director of the carrierservices organization at U S West Communications, asubsidiary of the U S West Inc. regional Bell company, saysthat out of 100,000 long-distance-carrier switches thecompany processes per month, only about 500 to 700 aredisputed.   Since a service change normally costs as much as $5, mostof those customers paid a fee to their local phone companyfor being switched if they couldn't prove that the change wasmade without their consent. If they could prove a mistake hadbeen made, the local phone company, with FCC backing, madethe long-distance carrier pay the charge.   To recover the costs of processing these complaints, BellAtlantic has raised its fees. It now is charging carriers$23.45 for each unauthorized residential switch and $39.96for each commercial pay-phone switch. Despite those fees, Mr.Edwards says Bell Atlantic's phone companies still expect tosee about 43,000 slamming complaints this year. BellSouth hasestablished similar fees to cover its costs. Ameritech, theMidwest Bell company, says it is reviewing its currentcharges to decide whether they warrant an increase.   The FCC is reviewing a request from ATandamp;T that wouldrequire written authorizations from customers before anyservice changes. ATandamp;T's Mr. Tutton notes that more than 30groups have filed public comments supporting ATandamp;T's petition,including the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Office of ConsumerAdvocate, the National Association of State Utility ConsumerAdvocates, the U.S. Telephone Association and SouthwesternBell Telephone Co.   But ATandamp;T's rivals refuse to back the idea; they say such acondition would favor ATandamp;T's dominant position. Mr.Worthington adds that MCI asks its customers to sign aconfirmation letter and return it for the company's records,but that of the letters sent out, &quot;we get back 30%.&quot; Althoughthe FCC &quot;requires&quot; such letters as proof that the customeragreed to switch, the only penalty for failure to have themis the fee for switching the customer back.   Although carriers are &quot;responsible&quot; for having theletters, says Steven Spaeth, an attorney in the FCC's CommonCarrier Bureau, the FCC has &quot;decided it's not a good idea toforce them.&quot; Mr. Spaeth indicates little sympathy for ATandamp;T.&quot;ATandamp;T seems to be concerned about a loss of revenues,&quot; hesays. &quot;One, I don't think {ATandamp;T's petition} would reduce thenumber of abuses, and, two, it would give ATandamp;T a firmer graspon market share than it has right now.&quot; Says Mr. Tutton: &quot;Heseems to be a little cynical about this, as if ATandamp;T has onlyits self-interest in mind.&quot;   The local phone companies say requiring writtenauthorizations would drive up their processing costs.   Perry Wade Lawson of Sneedville, Tenn., doesn't buy any ofthese arguments. Mr. Lawson, a 63-year-old with twoartificial hips and heart trouble, says he was slammed by MCIearlier this year (a charge MCI denies).   &quot;I told them I didn't want the service, and they switchedme anyway,&quot; Mr. Lawson complains. &quot;I'm a businessman. I ran asupermarket for 30 years, and I don't like the way MCI doesbusiness.&quot;   ---                  Controlling Phone Markets                                                                                                          1990 projected U.S. long distance telephone market share,as a percent of $48.9 billion sales*                                                                                                                   ATandamp;T                         70.4%            MCI                          15.4%            US Sprint                    10.5%            Telecom USA                   1.9%            Other                         1.8%                                                                                                          *Excludes approximately $27.5 billion in payments to localphone companies for access to their networks.
