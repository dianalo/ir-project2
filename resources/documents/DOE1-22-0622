The UKAEAhave chosen to dismantle the WAGR reactor. This decision is criticisedon the grounds that it will create large quantities of radioactive dustand liquids and disperse the radioactivity throughout the environment.The removal of the low and intermediate-level wastes will be expensive- it will be packaged in reinforced concrete boxes and as yet no disposalsite has been found for intermediate-level wastes. Greenpeace supportleaving disused reactors alone until a better option is available forwaste disposal. Dismantling an AGR will not, it is argued, give the UKAEAthe dismantling experience it needs as it will be the Magnox reactorsthat will end their service life first, and the techniques needed willbe different. The UKAEA is accused of 'playing with robots'.</TEXT></DOC>
