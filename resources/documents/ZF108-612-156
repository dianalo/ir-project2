Miller, head of the display applications team for the ElectronicsTechnology and Device Laboratory (ETDL) in Fort Monmouth, N.J., said thetests were conducted in the United States and Europe.andM;The defense Department soon will send the prototype system to a programmanager who will develop and field the system.andP;  Miller said the system willbe managed by theNavy.andM;The system will be used by the three military services.andM;The AIRES munition demonstrations were run on flat-panel computers withthin-film electroluminescent displays.andP;  Characteristics of unexploded bombsare entered in the system, which includes a write-once/read-many optical-diskstorage system that contains thousands of pages of munitions manuals.andM;The system contains information that otherwise would require carrying 16militarized safes filled with technical manuals to the battlefield.andM;ETDL officials already have begun a new round of experiments for AIRESmunitions applications.andM;The lab is developing a remote control video capture process that allows arobotic vehicle outfitted with video cameras to relay images of bombs in thefield.andM;With the aid of a computerized &quot;frame-grabber,&quot; characteristics of thesepictures can be transferred into digitized data describing the bomb.andP;  If sucha system is developed, munitions experts defusing the bomb will be able tomake informed decisions and avoid taking risks, DOS officials said.andM;Otherwise prototype flat-panel systems being developed at ETDL involve theuse of three-dimensional graphics and stereoscopic displays.andP;  Prototypeflat-panel applications also are being developed for a command and controlsystem in which tactical terrain maps can be made accessible to battlefieldcommanders, ETDL officials said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
