The freight railroad earned $72 million, or $1.04 a share, down from $145 million, or $2.21 a share, a year earlier. Revenue edged up 1% to $819 million from $811 million.    Conrail said the decline was anticipated because the sale to the public by the federal government in March substantially changed its status with respect to federal and state income taxes and other state taxes.    The company said that as a result, its net operating loss and investment credit carry-forwards, which had sheltered it from federal income taxes in recent years, were canceled concurrently with its public offering. Its previous exemption from state taxes was canceled as well.    L. Stanley Crane, chairman and chief executive officer, noted that the railroad continued to show traffic growth in the second quarter with an increase of 5.7% from a year ago.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Conrail closed at $33.125 a share, up 12.5 cents.    In the first half, net fell 23% to $158 million, or $2.30 a share, from $205 million, or $3.10 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 1.9% to $1.61 billion from $1.58 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
