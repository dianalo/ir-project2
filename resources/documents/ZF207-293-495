Taft IV, directedprogram managers to ask contractors to include specifications for delivery ofCALS data in contract bids.andP;  Taft said the degree to which contractors candeliver CALS data will be a factor in new awards and he directed programmanagers to review existing opportunities for using CALS.andM;There are three phases in the current DOD CALS plan.andP;  The first concentrateson converting paper-based communications into computer-based data and onintegrating industry's and the Defense Department's computer systems.andP;  Phasetwo adds to the new capabilities for weapons support through the redesign andconsolidation of the weapons support infrastructure.andP;  Phase three includesthe deployment of a standard DOD database.andM;Begin with DatabasesandM;All three services have their own plans for using CALS data, although allhave begun by developing databases to convert and store existing technicalinformation.andM;The Air Force and Army share the database system but call it by differentnames.andP;  The Air Force calls it the Engineering Data Computer AssistedRetrieval System (EDCARS) and the Army calls it DSREDS.andM;The Army is fielding up to seven systems at various commands, while the AirForce is installing its EDCARDS at five of its Air Logistics centers.andM;The Army and Air Force systems were developed before CALS standards werefinalized, but the systems subsequently were modified to incorporate CALSstandards.andM;The Navy and the Defense Logistics Agency are cooperating on fielding anEngineering Data Management Information Control System (EDMICS).andP;  The RFP wasreleased in August 1987, and Navy officials expect to award a contract thisyear for 47 systems.andM;CALS officials said they expect these databases will be used in the future asthe primary repository of digital data delivered by vendors.andP;  Karl J. Zauner,deputy chief of the CALS support division in Air Force Systems Command, saidthe Air Force is studying three proposed programs.andM;The Air Force Technical Order Management System (AFTOMS) is intended toautomate the process of creating, editing and updating the 23 million pagesin the Air Force technical manuals.andP;  This would improve efficiency and havean impact on all who use the technical manuals, Zauner said.andM;Service officials have budgeted about $240 million up to fiscal 1993 forAFTOMS, Zauner said.andM;The money will be used to field an infrastructure, he said, and probably willbe based initially on existing base-level computer systems.andP;  Later stages ofthe program would carry the information down to the aircraft hangers, hesaid.andM;Portable computers carrying the technical information are one possibility,Zauner said, but the danger of sparks and fires might eliminate them from usenear aircraft.andM;Improving ManintenanceandM;Another Air Force program being studied is the Integrated MaintenanceInformation System (IMIS), which is intended to improve the entiremaintenance effort, Zauner said.andP;  It will build upon AFTOMS and couldincorporate computer-aided maintenance systems and computerized diagnostics,he said.andM;Zauner said the Air Force also is studying the application of CALS for thecreation and use of logistics support analysis records, which are used todetermine maintenance, spare parts and fuel requirements.andM;Another group is studying product definition data, Zauner said.andP;  the programis designed to allow Air Force officials to describe accurately all partsused in a system and to ensure that different vendors produce the same item.andM;Product definition data includes not only information about the parts butalso its relationship to other parts.andP;  With modern weapon systems that usemillions of parts, such requirements demand a great deal from ADP systems.andO;An Air Force study on how to handle and use product definition data willcompleted soon, Zauner said.andM;Once the various studies are completed, plans for development of anarchitecture will move forward, he said.andM;Officials have not yet decided the lowest level to which the automated datawill be disseminated.andM;Zauner said he saw no need for direct transmission of CALS data to computerusers.andP;  Overnight mail and courier would be adequate and cheaper, he said,and communications links would be used to search for and order information.andM;Gorham, who now works for OSD's CALS office, said the Navy is studying apossible architecture for exploitation of CALS data.andM;Using the CALS standards, he said, a network could link the Navy'scomputeraided design systems used by five major commands to the 43 EDMICSsites and to contractor-owned databases.andP;  the network will use standard DODcommunications systems run by the Defense Communications Agency, he said.andM;The Navy CALS planning organization is headed by Navy CALS advocate Rear Adm.andO;Robert Harrison, who reports to the Navy's IRM chief, Adm.andP;  Paul Tobin.andP;  Asenior Navy CALS group composed of representatives from five of the Navy'smajor commands was formed to press for CALS.andM;Another study group composed of representatives from the major commands willproduce a report next month, Harrison said.andM;The report will outline how the Navy can best use CALS data, he said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
