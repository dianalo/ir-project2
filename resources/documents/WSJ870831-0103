Charges filed Friday in federal district court in San Diego -- the first antitrust charges by the government as part of the criminal investigation -- accuse a unit of Tulsa, Okla.-based Word Industries Inc., two of its executives and a former president of Capitol Pipe andamp; Steel Products Inc. of conspiring to raise the price of steel and alloy pipes. Capitol Pipe, a unit of Bowline Corp., based in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., is a major supplier of high-quality stainless steel pipe used in nuclear power plants.    These charges, however, are only the tip of what law enforcement officials said is a nationwide inquiry that now involves at least seven federal grand juries delving into the construction of nuclear power plants and other industrial-piping projects stretching from the West Coast to Georgia, Tennessee, the Southwest and some New England states.    Additional grand juries are to be empaneled in the next few months, according to law enforcement officials, as prosecutors broaden their investigation to include subcontractors who are suspected of collusion, bid-rigging and other criminal violations involving some of the country's largest and most expensive nuclear power plants since the mid-1970s.    Assistant Attorney General Charles Rule, the head of the Justice Department's antitrust division, said in an interview that federal investigators &quot;have developed significant evidence&quot; pointing to a possible &quot;extensive series&quot; of antitrust violations involving the pipe-fabricating industry.    &quot;We are expecting very significant indictments involving a large number of people,&quot; Mr. Rule said, adding that federal antitrust enforcers already have interviewed &quot;more than 100 individuals from dozens of companies.&quot;    Meanwhile, other parts of the Justice Department are continuing separate criminal investigations into suspected fraudulent-pricing schemes, bribes, kickbacks and tax evasion involving large and small pipe fabricators.    Rusty Herman, a prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney's office in Houston, where many pipe fabricators are based, disclosed in an interview that &quot;most of the six to 10 major fabricators&quot; in the industry currently are under investigation. Referring to the scope of the Houston grand jury probe, Mr. Herman said, &quot;My venue is almost nationwide.&quot; While declining to identify targets of the investigation, he predicted that additional charges will be filed in the next few months.    Current and former units of Dravo Corp., Gulf andamp; Western Inc., ITT Corp. and Johnson Controls Inc. previously were named in papers filed by the government in federal district court in Seattle as alleged participants in fraudulent schemes to inflate costs on pipe-fabrication projects since the 1970s. But none of the companies has been charged with any violations, and it isn't known whether they are targets of the current federal probes.    Officials at Dravo, Gulf andamp; Western and Johnson Controls could not be reached yesterday for comment. &quot;I'm not aware of anything involving ITT or any of its present or former units,&quot; a spokesman for ITT said in reply to questions concerning the government filing in federal district court in Seattle.    At least 14 smaller pipe fabricators around the country also have been named in court papers as alleged participants in &quot;price-boosting schemes,&quot; while a total of 25 companies and individuals have pleaded guilty or been convicted of criminal charges stemming from a three-year probe spearheaded by the U.S. Attorney's office in Seattle. The government has obtained more than $7 million in restitution.    Starting as a relatively small inquiry focusing on inflated costs for piping used in nuclear power plants built by the Washington Public Power Supply System, the investigation has turned into a high-profile, high-priority effort that includes the Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. postal inspectors, the Internal Revenue Service and senior white-collar crime prosecutors at Justice Department headquarters.    According to some prosecutors, anti-competitive practices in portions of the industry became so widespread over the years that some purchasing agents involved in industrial-piping projects secretly told pipe fabricators or suppliers to coordinate their bids before submitting prices. In court papers, prosecutors have described practices that they contend amounted to &quot;an industrywide predatory scheme&quot; that bilked customers out of untold millions of dollars and allegedly &quot;spread like a cancer through the pipe-fabricating industry&quot; since the mid-1970s.    The bid-rigging charges filed in San Diego came a day after separate but related criminal informations alleging fraud and conspiracy were filed in federal courts in Houston and Seattle against the same defendants. Prosecutors said they are negotiating the final details of plea agreements, and Word Industries is expected to agree to make restitution of between $1.5 million and $5 million.    Piping makes up a substantial part of the construction cost of a typical nuclear power plant, and victims identified in some of the latest charges include New Hampshire's controversial Seabrook nuclear plant and the Beaver Valley plant near Pittsburgh.    Named in last week's charges were Thomas Word of Tulsa, president of Word Industries; Louis Stuart, president of the company's Tulsa-based Oil Capitol Supply Inc. unit; and Robert Tutterow of Charlotte, N.C., former president of Capitol Pipe. Capitol Pipe previously was convicted of fraud and other charges stemming from the investigation.    Mr. Word, Mr. Stuart and Mr. Tutterow could not be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
