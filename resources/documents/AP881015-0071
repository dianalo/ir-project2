The fraud investigation of the Sundstrand Corp. revealed thedestruction of memos and internal reports, creative accounting,favors paid to government officials, hidden ownership, even acharge to the government for personal expenses like golfing and dogkennel fees.   It was an easy path to follow for a federal prosecutor schooledin the shenanigans of Chicago's City Hall.   ``I think as in most public corruption cases, the people atSundstrand developed the attitude that these kinds of things werepart of the cost of doing business,'' U.S. Attorney Anton Valukassaid.   ``They probably thought that prosecution would be too complex,or that the government wouldn't follow through ... or that even ifthe company did get caught, it could settle up civilly.   ``But we took the same approach we take in other corruptioncases. And by the time you factor in the additional problems ofcriminal charges, it becomes so expensive that they won't even lookat this kind of thing any more.''   Sundstrand agreed on Wednesday to plead guilty to a four-countcriminal complaint charging that it overbilled the Pentagon forairplane parts and to pay $115 million in fines and penalties, thelargest fraud settlement ever.   The Defense Department accounts for 42 percent of Sundstrand's$1.4 billion in annual sales.   The company has declined to comment on the plea agreement,except to say it was a step toward putting the scandal behind it.   But the matter may be far from over. A federal grand jury isconsidering charges against Sundstrand employees. And there remainsthe possibility of further administrative fines against theRockford-based company, and the suspension of its right to bid onfuture defense contracts.   The plea agreement revealed several separate schemes to defraudthe government. It also indicated that improprieties climbed atleast into the supervisory level and possibly higher.   ``Company officials set out to get contracts in instances wherethey knew well in advance they couldn't perform for the fixedprice,'' Valukas said. ``What flowed from that were a number ofdifferent attempts to hide the overruns.''   The complaint alleges those practices continued from August 1981through June 1985 _ but that Sundstrand employees were ordered inApril 1984 to destroy an internal report and work papers thatsuggested management officials were aware they were not complyingwith government regulations.   Of even longer-standing practice was Sundstrand's willingness topay gratuities _ ranging from wine to theater tickets to golfoutings _ to Defense Department personnel to win business, and thenhide the government employees' names. The employees were notidentified in the complaint.   A 1980 company directive ordered that the names be given tosupervisors orally, or in writing on small slips of paper that wereimmediately destroyed. And even after the Pentagon issued new ruleson gratuities for defense officials, Sundstrand told supervisorsthat salesmen could continue to write ``customer'' on their expenseaccounts instead of the public employees' names.   The complaint also charges Sundstrand engaged in a thirdcover-up, moving spare aircraft parts to a warehouse owned by aWisconsin company, then concealing the extent of its ownership toprevent the Internal Revenue Service from disallowing millions ofdollars in tax writeoffs.   A fourth count charged that other overhead accounts submitted tothe government attempted to disguise luxuries for Sundstrandexecutives ranging from saunas and radar detectors to snow plowingand servants.   The federal charges were not the first indication that somethingwas wrong.   Col. Francis Holland, Chicago regional commander of DefenseContract Administration Services, told the Chicago Tribune thatgovernment auditors had uncovered millions of dollars inimproprieties by late 1982.   And he said internal audit memos that made the rounds at thecompany should have ``raised red flags'' as well.   ``No one in Sundstrand can say `Gee whiz, this is just a minorthing and no one paid any attention to it,''' Holland recalled.   Yet his agency, which monitors contracts after they are awardedby other sections of the Defense Department, negotiated withSundstrand for two years on how much the company should repay thegovernment before turning to criminal investigators.</TEXT></DOC>
