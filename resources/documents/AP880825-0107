TRAFFIC Japan, the wildlife trade monitoring group of the WorldWide Fund for Nature, said the smugglers shipped South Americancaiman skins by a complex route involving at least seven SouthAmerican and Asian countries.   At least 46 tons of the skins from more than 120,000 alligatorsentered Japan in the first seven months of this year throughThailand alone, the group said.   It said it believed the skins were part of a larger shipmentthat was loaded onto Asian-bound ships off the coast of Uruguay atthe end of last year.   The declared customs value of the skins was about $3.2 million,``but retail value would be four to five times more,'' spokeswomanCecila Song said. The skins are used in Japan mainly for belts andwatchbands.   Permits are required for exporting South American caiman skinsunder the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species,an international treaty regulating trade in protected plants andanimals, Ms. Song said.   Japanese officials allowed the shipments to enter the countrywithout proper verification of the export documents, the group said.   It said an eight-month investigation revealed a serious lapse oftreaty administration in Thailand and Japan.   The group said it began its investigation when Japanese customsdata showed a sudden increase in imports of alligator skins fromThailand.   It said Thai authorities confirmed that stolen Thai documentswere used for a shipment of 15,000 caiman skins to Japan, and thatthe government of Colombia disputed documents issued in Singaporethat identified Colombia as the source of 35,000 more skins.   An estimated 200,000 caiman skins, many poached in Brazil, wereloaded on ships off Uruguay in 1987. After Japan initially refusedto allow their entry because of insufficient documentation, theskins were taken to South Korea and Taiwan, which are not membersof the convention, and to Singapore, the group said.   But because Japan was likely to scrutinize imports of skins fromthose countries, they were moved to Thailand, which is a member ofthe convention, the group said.   It said Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industryresponded to evidence of illegal caiman trade by beginning a newvoluntary check system on all imports of the skins. Ministryofficials were not available Thursday night for comment.</TEXT></DOC>
