The study, which is being criticized as flawed by industry officials, is expected to support a long-awaited move by the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration to cut sharply benzene levels permitted in the workplace. Benzene is widely used in petroleum products and in making plastics, rubber, solvents and other materials.    Meanwhile, another team of researchers reported in the same publication that developing fetuses exposed to extremely low levels of lead may subsequently suffer learning disabilities.    The benzene study, conducted by researchers at the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, an arm of OSHA, found that rubber industry workers exposed to benzene vapors at levels of 10 parts per million units of air -- the current federal standard -- faced a threefold risk of leukemia and a fourfold risk of multiple myeloma, a deadly bone cancer, compared with workers who weren't exposed.    The NIOSH study updated past health reviews of workers at several rubber industry plants between the late 1930s and early 1970s. The significant aspect of the new report is that it attempted to correlate incidence of cancers among workers with specific levels of benzene exposure.    William O'Keefe, an official of the American Petroleum Institute, a trade group, called the NIOSH report &quot;seriously flawed.&quot; Mr. O'Keefe said the trade group believes that past benzene levels at the plants in question were significantly higher than NIOSH estimated, thus raising the possibility that cancer-stricken workers had received higher than currently permissible doses of benzene.    &quot;There is no clear scientific evidence that a 10-ppm (benzene) exposure level is inadequate,&quot; to protect worker safety, said Mr. O'Keefe.    Benzene exposure has been previously linked to leukemia. In 1980, The U.S. Supreme Court rejected an effort by OSHA to lower workplace benzene levels to one ppm from 10 ppm on the grounds that scientific evidence at that time didn't support the move. After lengthy criticism from labor groups, OSHA announced last year that it might again impose a one ppm limit. The agency's final ruling on the matter is expected within the next two months.    Mr. O'Keefe said the trade group won't oppose the anticipated new one ppm standard -- if the new rule specifically states that such a level, when combined with proper workplace practices, doesn't pose a cancer hazard to workers. Such a ruling might effectively shield companies from benzene-related cancer claims by workers exposed to one ppm levels.    Meanwhile, researchers at the Harvard Medical School and several other institutions reported that the learning abililty of children diminished as a function of their prenatal exposure to lead.    Previous reports have linked learning disabilities in children to lead exposure, but the new study indicates that developing fetuses may be far more sensitive than children to lead. </TEXT></DOC>
