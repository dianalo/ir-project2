Despite the trade gap's unexpectedly sharp narrowing in March, many currency dealers remain skeptical about the dollar's immediate prospects for continued recovery. They cited heavy selling pressure against the dollar from foreign corporations, especially Japanese, at levels around the dollar's intraday highs yesterday.    Some traders said they were also troubled by segments of the Commerce Department's report that indicate much of the improvement may be unsustainable.    &quot;I don't feel the dollar is a buy,&quot; said Arnie Sherrer, chief foreign exchange trader at Royal Bank of Canada's New York office. &quot;You might look at this (trade report) and say this is the best trade number you'll see for a few months. On that theory, you might want to sell&quot; the dollar, he said.    The news that the trade deficit narrowed to $9.75 billion in March from $13.83 billion in February triggered an immediate response in currency markets.    The dollar promptly topped 1.7 West German marks, from 1.6865 in the minutes before the 8:30 a.m. report. By late New York trading, the dollar stood at 1.7065 marks, up 1% from its Monday level of 1.6897, and slightly below yesterday's high of 1.7077. The dollar also climbed 1.3% to 1.4232 Swiss francs, from 1.4044 Monday.    Sterling suffered a steep 1.4% drop to $1.8608, from $1.8880, as base-rate reductions by banks in the United Kingdom exacerbated the pound's losses to the strengthening dollar. The unexpected lowering of the key interest rates of major British banks made sterling-denominated investments relatively less attractive, curtailing demand for the pound. The pound also fell a relatively sharp 0.5% to 3.1755 marks, from 3.1902.    The dollar's 0.7% gain against the Japanese currency -- to 125.80 yen, from 124.93 -- was less than its rise against its European counterparts because the trade report showed a widening of the U.S. trade gap with Japan despite an overall shrinkage.    In midday trading in Tokyo Wednesday, the dollar was quoted at 125.48 yen.    &quot;This problem with Japan hasn't been corrected,&quot; said Yani M.A. Budiman, vice president of foreign exchange at Chemical New York Corp.'s Chemical Bank unit.    Traders pointed to other parts of the trade report to express doubts about the dollar's long-term outlook.    Ryohei Takashima, chief corporate trader at Bank of Tokyo's New York branch, said much of the 23% rise in U.S. exports responsible for shrinking the trade deficit came from a &quot;one-time increase&quot; in gold shipments, mostly to Taiwan. The Commerce Department said gold shipments soared to $1.1 billion in March from $400 million the previous month.    The sharp increase in exports, and a separate report yesterday showing gains in U.S. capacity utilization, raise concerns about the U.S. economic outlook, Mr. Takashima said.    &quot;The implication is the economy is very strong and there's a good possibility that inflation will increase. And that is very bearish for the dollar,&quot; he said.    For the dollar's rally to continue, traders said the U.S. currency has to get free of a wet blanket in the form of large sell orders, primarily from Japanese corporations. Some traders said Japanese companies left about $1 billion in sell orders to be executed by their banks should the dollar rise back to yesterday's highs.    &quot;We're still in a trading range. We just raised it by one pfennig and one yen,&quot; said Mr. Sherrer at Royal Bank.    On New York's Commodity Exchange, current-delivery gold rose 60 cents an ounce, to $455.50, in heavy trading. The estimated volume was 6.5 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $453.75 an ounce in early trading Wednesday in Hong Kong.    ---                    LATE NEW YORK TRADING                    Tuesday, May 17, 1988    Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
