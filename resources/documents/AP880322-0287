By an 8-0 vote, the court said real estate developers inKentucky should not be subjected to a heavier tax burden becausethey formed corporations for the sole purpose of borrowing money.   Jesse C. Bollinger, either individually or in partnership withothers, developed eight apartment complexes in the Lexington, Ky.,area beginning in 1968.   To obtain construction-financing loans, Bollinger formedcorporations to borrow the money at 8 percent interest. Kentucky'susury law at the time limited the interest non-corporate borrowerscould be charged to 7 percent, and lenders were not willing tofinance Bollinger's projects at that rate.   When Bollinger and his partners sought to claim business lossesconnected with the apartment projects on their individual federalincome taxes, the IRS disallowed it.   The tax agency said the losses must be attributed to thecorporations, deemed to be the true owners of the apartmentcomplexes. That designation worked to the tax disadvantage ofBollinger and his partners.   A federal appeals court ruled against the IRS, and today'sdecision upheld that ruling.   Writing for the court, Justice Antonin Scalia said thecorporations had been formed for a legitimate, non-manipulativepurpose.   ``It seems to us that ... tax-avoiding manipulation (is)adequately avoided when ... the corporation is acting as agent forits shareholders with respect to a particular asset (the apartmentcomplexes) is set forth in a written agreement at the time theasset is acquired,'' Scalia said.   He also noted that the corporations at issue in this casefunctioned ``as agent and not principal with respect to the assetfor all purposes, and the corporation is held out as the agent andnot principal in all dealings with third parties relating to theasset.''   The case is Commissioner, IRS vs. Bollinger, 86-1672.</TEXT></DOC>
