Ex-Im Bank officials said Corning Glass Works has a $94.4 million contract to supply specialized glass-making equipment and engineering services to the Shenzhen Color Picture Tube Glass Corp. The bank will lend $80.2 million for the project at a 7.4% annual interest rate.    The polyvinyl chloride plant equipment will be supplied by Occidental Chemical Corp., a unit of Occidental Petroleum Corp., at a cost of $13.6 million. The loan totals $10 million and will carry an interest rate of 8.3% a year.    The Ex-Im Bank said that Corning and Occidental both were competing with foreign companies for the sales.    With the approval of these loans, the export credit agency said it has helped to finance the sale of about $289 million of U.S. goods and services to China for various industrial projects during the past year. </TEXT></DOC>
