Soon after the ceremonies are over, many graduates will gettheir first taste of managing their own money full time as theyembark on their adult lives.   It can be a big transition, but it needn't be a traumatic one.The students of the 1980s, by all accounts, are much moresophisticated about money matters than generations past.   Furthermore, the occasion comes for most people at a stage oflife when they have energy and resiliency to spare, and plenty oftime to get some trial-and-error experience with money managementbefore they start making big commitments such as buying a home.   Still, there are many pitfalls to be avoided. Suppose, forinstance, you plan to commute by car to a new job.   It's important to take all the costs of that car into account _monthly payments, insurance, and maintenance as well as gasoline _if you want to make sure that most of your income doesn't getconsumed by the cost of getting to and from your job.   A similar problem can arise with clothing. Many jobs naturallyrequire that you look your best, and the clothes you wore in schoolmay not measure up to that standard.   But an all-out splurge on a new wardrobe can mean that you haveto work very hard just to pay for what you wear while you'reworking.   ``Try starting off gradually with skirts or slacks from yourcurrent wardrobe and adding a basic suit and a jacket that willcoordinate with these,'' suggests the American Financial ServicesAssociation, a trade group representing financial-services firms.   Some other tips suggested by the AFSA:   _ Like individual money managers of all ages, you will need tohandle credit cards and other borrowing with extreme care. Yourcapacity for debt may already be stretched by student loans thatremain to be paid.   But that doesn't mean that you should necessarily avoid allcredit offerings. One or two judiciously chosen credit cards mayhelp you establish a good credit history that might be useful lateron.   ``Many college graduates are sent credit applications when theygraduate,'' observes Frances Smith of the AFSA.   ``If you think you'll need access to credit early on, it may agood idea to take advantage of one of these offers. Once yourelocate and get a new job, it may be more difficult initially foryou to obtain credit.''   _ Learn to plan eating and entertainment expenses to get themost benefit at a reasonable cost.   Brown-bag lunches at work and dinner at home can save you a lotof money that might otherwise be spent eating out all the time.   ``Try to keep your refrigerator and shelves stocked so that youwon't be tempted to go out for meals too often,'' the AFSA advises.   Another tried-and-true approach to keeping food bills down:Always aim to shop with a list of the items you need (andpreferably not when you are famished from a long day of work andexercise).   According to the Howard Marlboro Group, a New York firm thatprovides marketing information, fewer than one-third of supermarketshoppers enter the store armed with a list.   And more than half of the sales racked up by supermarketsrepresent ``impulse'' sales _ unplanned purchases ranging heavilyto items like magazines, candy and gum, greeting cards and snacks.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Thurs May 18</NOTE></DOC>
