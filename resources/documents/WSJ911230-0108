Mr. Dawkins becomes the fourth treasurer in seven months.His appointment came as part of a cabinet shuffle thatelevated a coterie of Labor Party politicians who backed Mr.Keating's bid earlier this month to topple Prime Minister BobHawke in a bitter party ballot.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Dawkins, a 44-year-old politician regarded as anindependent thinker and strong Keating ally, succeeds RalphWillis, who held the treasurer's job for less than threeweeks. Mr. Willis, a Hawke ally, will return to his previousportfolio of finance.   Under Mr. Keating, the number of cabinet positions willincrease to 18 from 17 with the creation of a minister fortourism, reflecting the growing importance of tourism to theeconomy. Still, the shuffle mostly moved portfolios amonglongtime cabinet ministers rather than injecting new blood.And while they were intended to reward Keating loyalists, thechanges carefully reallocated portfolios to cause the leasttension in the splintered party, political commentators said.   Among other key positions shuffled, Kim Beazley, anotherHawke ally who had succeeded Mr. Willis as finance minister,was named to the less-prestigious portfolio of employment.Graham Richardson, a staunch Keating supporter who held thesocial security portfolio, was named minister of transportand communications. John Kerin, who succeeded Mr. Keating astreasurer last June only to be fired by Mr. Hawke early thismonth and assigned to the transport and communicationsportfolio, was dumped in the latest shuffle. He was given anoncabinet position as minister for trade and overseasdevelopment.   Mr. Keating said the revamped cabinet will &quot;be able to hitthe ground running.&quot; He also reaffirmed a pledge he made onbecoming prime minister &quot;to restart {economic} growth andemployment as quickly as possible.&quot;   Mr. Dawkins has indicated he favors more governmentintervention in economic matters, especially for bolsteringthe economy and raising exports. The new treasurer also hassuggested the government should consider measures that wouldgive it more influence over the value of the Australiandollar, implying he favors a lower value for the currency tohelp exports.</TEXT></DOC>
