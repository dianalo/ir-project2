A densely packed fluidized bed was maintained by balancingthe drag and buoyancy forces of the incoming substrate with that of thecentrifugal forces. With this approach, effluent streams were relativelyfree of cells and a small residence time assured the provision of adequatenutrient requirements and rapid removal of the product. This conceptwas tested using a nonflocculating strain of the yeast Saccharomycescerevisiae. The focus of this research was to clarify operating regimesand assess the feasibility of cell culture in a high gravity environment.(Refs. 14).</TEXT></DOC>
