In the bond market, prices of long-term Treasury issues drifted slightly lower in the morning but later rebounded to wind up with small gains. The latest 30-year Treasury bonds rose 1/8 of a point, or $1.25 for each $1,000 face amount, while the yield slipped to 9.33% from 9.34%.    The bond market's advances Monday and last Friday were &quot;merely technical rallies,&quot; said Wayne F. Wong, a managing director at Marinvest Inc., a subsidiary of Marine Midland Banks Inc. He remains bearish on long-term bonds, adding that he sold about $20 million of 10-year Treasury notes early yesterday.    &quot;Most of the economic numbers continue to show positive growth, not recession,&quot; Mr. Wong said. He believes the risks of higher inflation and increased interest rates are far greater than the possibility of recession. Moreover, additional evidence of economic strength is expected Friday morning when the government releases its monthly employment report.    &quot;Why buy long-term Treasurys when you can park your money in 3- and 6-month Eurodollar CDs (certificates of deposit) paying you 8 3/4% to 8.90%?&quot; Mr. Wong said. &quot;That doesn't give you much incentive&quot; to buy long-term bonds.    Inflation worries persist despite Commerce Department reports showing declines in factory orders and the leading economic indicators index for July. Those declines generally were anticipated and helped spark Monday's bond market rally, which was the largest in nearly a month.    Now the focus has shifted to Friday's employment report. The employment figures, released each month by the Labor Department, often contain major surprises. Trading volume often slows in the days ahead of the report as many dealers even their positions.    Federal Reserve officials pay special attention to these figures in setting credit policy. When the reports show strong employment gains, as they have in the past few months, traders conclude that this could add to inflation pressure and that the Federal Reserve will respond by boosting short-term interest rates.    This month's report generally is expected to show about the same employment gains as July, with little or no change in the civilian unemployment rate. In July, the number of workers on business payrolls rose 283,000, while the unemployment rate was 5.4%.    Treasury Securities   Treasury bonds fell nearly half a point, or $5 for each $1,000 face amount, before bouncing back up again.    The latest 30-year Treasury bonds finished at 97 30/32, up slightly from 97 26/32 Monday. The government's latest 10-year notes also rose 1/4 point to 99 30/32, as the yield fell to 9.26% from 9.28%.    The long-term Treasury bond market has been strongly influenced by speculation over when Congress finally will get around to enacting an increase in the government's authority to sell new long-term bonds. Some analysts now predict Congress will act in time for the Treasury to include new 30-year bonds as part of its quarterly financing operation to be announced early in November. But legislative specialists say the situation remains murky.    The Treasury didn't sell any 30-year bonds in its August financing because it nearly had exhausted its bond issuance authority and Congress hadn't passed pending legislation to give it unlimited long bond issuance authority.    Assistant Treasury Secretary Charles Sethness said earlier this month there are no assurances that the Treasury will have authority to sell a long bond in November. He noted that a proposal to fix the long bond problem is attached to technical correction tax legislation facing uncertain prospects.    The long-term bond measure isn't in dispute itself, but rather hinges on the fate of the tax legislation to which it is attached.    Although Treasury officials are quick to say they really don't know what will happen in the legislative trenches in the period ahead, they are encouraged that the House of Representatives, as well as the Senate Finance Committee, have embraced repeal of the old interest rate cap on long-term bonds. &quot;That's a plus and it tends to increase the likelihood of something being done,&quot; an official said.    In the bond market, Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury issues increased 2.31 points to 1210.04. The high was 1213.10, while the low was 1205.65.    Short-term interest rates were mixed. The rate on three-month Treasury bills rose slightly to 7.29% bid from an average of 7.26% set at Monday's government auction. The rate on six-month bills fell slightly to 7.49% bid from Monday's auction average of 7.50%.    The Treasury yesterday sold 20-day cash management bills at an average rate of 7.93%. Here are details:   Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.                                20-Day Cash-Management Bills Applications ............................. $40,570,000,000 Accepted bids ............................ $10,052,090,000 Accepted at low price ................................ 37% Average price (Rate) ....................... 99.559(7.93%) High price (Rate) .......................... 99.561(7.90%) Low price (Rate) ........................... 99.559(7.94%) Coupon equivalent .................................. 8.08%   The bills are dated Sept. 2 and mature Sept. 22.   Foreign Bonds   Japanese and West German government bonds advanced, but British government issues fell slightly, while Canadian bonds were little changed.   In Tokyo, Japanese government bonds finished at their highs of the day in quiet trading. The benchmark No. 105, 5% bonds due 1997 closed at a price of 97.86, up 0.10 yen for each 100 yen face value. The yield fell 1.5 basis points to 5.345%.   West German government bonds ended the interbank trading day as much as 0.15 point firmer, also in quiet activity.   The government's 6 3/4% issue due 1998 was quoted at 99.90 bid to yield 6.76%. That compared with Monday's interbank close of 99.75, to yield 6.78%. On the Euromark side, the European Investment Bank's 5 7/8% issue due 1998 was unchanged at 98.5.   In the Eurobond market, three Japanese banks brought $500 million in new Eurodollar bond offerings, and other issues by Japanese lenders reportedly are planned, even though the market for such bonds is seen as growing oversupplied.   Japan Development Bank, the long-term lending agency, offered $200 million of five-year paper, and Nippon Credit Bank (Curacao) launched a $150 million, five-year deal. The third issue was Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Australia Ltd.'s $150 million of four-year bonds, the shortest maturity permitted by Japanese regulators.   The latest three Japanese bank issues brought to nearly $1 billion the volume of such offerings in about a week. The issues have been largely aimed at Japanese trust funds, as opposed to life insurers, with some buying also seen among Middle Eastern investors. But the burst of issuance recently is &quot;too much,&quot; said one Japanese syndicate manager, and any further issuers may face tough going.   In the secondary market, Eurodollar bond prices were marked about 3/8 to 1/2 point higher in response to Monday's sharp gains in the U.S. Treasury market.   In London, prices of British gilts ended slightly lower amid continued speculation that U.K. base rates will rise again sometime soon.   Last week, base rates rose one percentage point point to 12%. While some analysts feel further rate rises will be necessary, others suggest confidence won't return to gilts until concrete signs of a slowdown have become apparent.   Late yesterday, the benchmark Treasury 11 3/4% bonds due 2003/2007, which rose as far as 114 3/32, were down 8/32 to 113 19/32 to yield 9.94%.   Canadian bonds were little changed, also in light volume. Among active issues, the Canadian government's benchmark 10 1/8% bonds due in 10 years finished at 99 1/8 to yield 10.39%, the same as late Monday.   Mortgage-Backed Securities   Ginnie Maes and other mortgage securities ended 2/32 higher but lagged behind gains in the Treasury market for the second straight session despite the offering of two sizable Remics.   The two real estate mortgage investment conduits, from Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. totaled $750 million, and marked the biggest single-day Remic volume in two weeks.   Remic activity often gives a significant boost to the prices of the underlying mortgage pass-through securities because underwriters have to purchase the collateral in the secondary market, but that wasn't the case yesterday.   Both the $350 million Kidder Peabody issue and the $400 million Freddie Mac deal included sizable classes designed to give investors much of the cash-flow certainty of corporate bonds. Such classes have been used in nearly all recent Remic offerings.   Ginnie Mae 9 1/2% bonds, which were used to back the Kidder Peabody offering, gained 2/32, and Freddie Mac 10% securities, which collateralize the Freddie Mac issue, also advanced 2/32. By comparison, the 10-year Treasury note, the benchmark against which mortgage securities prices are measured, was up 6/32.   Traders said they weren't sure why the mortgage market lagged behind Treasurys, but they noted that the collateral for the two Remics probably was accumulated before Tuesday. The Freddie Mac Remic was rumored Monday.   In the pass-through market, Ginnie Mae 9% securities for September delivery ended at 92 7/8, up 2/32; 9 1/2% securities at 95 26/32, up 2/32; 10% securities at 98 3/4, up 2/32; and Freddie Mac 10% securities at 98 3/8, also up 2/32.   The Ginnie Mae 10% securities were yielding 10.33% to a 12-year average life assumption, as the spread above the 10-year Treasury note widened three basis points to 108 basis points. Since Friday, this spread has widened five basis points.   Corporate Issues   Corporate bond prices finished the session flat to 1/8 point higher in light dealings.   Among the new issues was a $100 million five-year note offering for Domtar Inc.   The 9 5/8% notes were priced at 99.79 to yield 9.68%, a spread of 68 basis points above the rate of the Treasury five-year note.   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this month, the company said it planned to use proceeds from the note offering to reduce commercial paper and other short-term borrowings.   Salomon Brothers Inc. was lead underwriter for the issue.   Municipal Issues   Municipal bonds finished mixed in another lethargic session.   The New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20% bonds due 2018 were quoted late in the day at 90 3/8 bid. That was up 1/8 of a point but off the intraday peak of 90 1/2 reached early in the session.   The bonds yielded about 8.06%, unchanged from late Monday.   The volume of new issues continues to be light, helping to bolster the market, analysts said.</TEXT></DOC>
