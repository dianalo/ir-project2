systems.andM;A file manager handles a database of business contacts, for example, as aseries of records with all the information on each contract in one file.andO;This one file is an entity unto itself and does not need access to data inother files to be effective.andP;  A multiple-file database--an order-entrysystem, for instance--puts customer information (name, credit limit, etc.),andO;order information (date, delivery type, etc.), and inventory information(price, quantity on hand, etc.) in separate files.andM;The first PC flat-file database managers were little more than simple filemanagers, but today many of them--including Professional File and Qandamp;A--offerlookup features that give you limited access to other files; they're notactually relational, but they provide a touch of relational flexibility.andP;  Youcan enter a field in one file to look for the same type of information inanother.andP;  For instance, if you were entering information on an employee, youcould verify the person's employee ID number by entering an ID field on yourscreen and doing a lookup on the master file.andM;Most everyday database needs can be met with flat-file management programs.andO;Designed for nontechnical users, these programs are good choices for businessmanagers who want to use a database without sweating over a manual to learnone.andM;A few databases, such as PowerBase, from PowerBase Systems of Birmingham,Michigan, provide multiple-file capabilities but do not have a programminglanguage.andM;Programmable DatabasesandM;More expensive, full-featured software is often labeled &quot;high-end.&quot;andP;  Amongdatabases, high-end usually means that the product has some programmingcapability.andM;The question is, do you need it?andP;  What you really want is a database thatalready has the functionality you require built into it.andM;There are times, however, when a program doesn't quite fit the situation.andP;  Atthose times, software with a good programming language lets you createapplications that perform to your specifications.andP;  Just remember that thecost of customizing your database software with its programming languageinvolves more than the additional amount you'll pay for the software.andP;  Counton hiring a programmer or consultant, and hiring him again to work out thebugs that often occur.andM;Don't let a programming language scare you away from high-end products.andP;  Youcan use the features of these programs without dealing with the languages.andM;If you decide to take advantage of the software's programming abilities, youshould learn about application generators--utilities that automatically writeprogramming code.andP;  Such tools can save a database programmer a lot of time,but they produce only segments of an application; you'll have to fine-tunethe programs yourself.andM;To SQL or Not?andM;Structured Query Language, a language used in minicomputer and mainframedatabases, is gaining popularity in the PC market.andP;  You'll find it inhigh-end databases.andP;  SQL offers a distinct advantage: it provides a set ofuniform commands that work with any database software that has SQL, whichmeans you can usually access files on a mini or mainframe computer from yourPC.andM;Do most users need SQL?andP;  Probably not.andP;  It's more important to find adatabase with a query facility that you feel comfortable with and thatperforms the functions you need.andM;Help and EnhancementsandM;User interfaces in database packages have improved dramatically in recentyears; vendors are providing menus and plenty of help screens.andP;  ProfessionalFile and Qandamp;A, for example, have tiled menus, each offering an additionallayer of assistance over the one before.andP;  R:BASE helps you build commands byprompting you for information.andP;  dBASE offers pull-down menus.andP;  Some databasesystems support a mouse, but few, if any, are very good at it.andM;Another factor to consider when choosing a database is the number of add-insand aftermarket products available for it.andP;  Such products includefeature-rich report writers, compilers, application generators, mailing-labelgenerators, and just about anything else you can think of.andP;  If you're using apopular database program that can't do something you want it to, athird-party product can add that capability.andM;But let the buyer beware.andP;  Many add-in programs are poorly written, buggy,and not worth the floppies they come on.andP;  Unless the products are sold orendorsed by the original database vendor, it's best to stay away from them.andM;Other issues arise if you're moving up from a PC to a local area network.andO;Single-user software will not run properly on a LAN; you should get a networkupgrade from the software publisher.andP;  And upgrades alone won't solve yourproblems if a programmer has customized applications for your PC; these willhave to be modified as well.andP;  Your database vendor can offer guidance on howto do it.andM;The following reviews should help even more.andP;  We look at six leading databaseproducts--flat-file and relational, high-end and low-end--and discuss whatthey will and won't do for you.andM;Of the group, the Lotus Development Corporation's 1-2-3 is the lowest of thelow-end products; its database functions are severely limited.andP;  ProfessionalFile and Qandamp;A are flat-file managers; Paradox, R:BASE for DOS, and dBASE IVare relational, high-end products that offer programming power but arerelatively easy to use.andM;Which is best?andP;  No one package suits all users and all applications.andO;Consider the features you need and choose what's right for you.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
