General Statement of the Invention </PAR><PAR>  The present invention comprises a promotional card with easel and      standard-holder on its reverse. This display unit can be used as a header      assembly with a standard (post) or preferably a pre-scored piece of      corrugated material which can be folded for mailing and folded into a      standard upon receipt, or as a counter-card by folding out the easel wings      and locking them into place with the included lock, or as a frame-card in      a frame-card holder. The pre-scored piece of corrugated material serves as      a standard, but can be folded lengthwise to reduce its length for      convenient mailing. </PAR><PAR>  In preferred embodiments, the easel can be a double easel with two wings      folding out for improved stability, as in the device shown in FIG. 1. The      base for the standard shown in FIG. 3 can be a mounting device as shown in      FIG. 2 with two fold-outs adapted to receive the standard shown in FIG. 3,      and with additional appendages to attach to a container or other      supporting base, e.g. a bottle for motor oil. </PAR><PAR>  Alternatively, the standard which is preferably three-sided for economy and      stability, can be stabbed between packages in a carton, e.g. between motor      oil bottles of the type shown in FIG. 4 which are packed standing      vertically in a carton of 12 or 24. This provides product display, a      supply of product, and the point-of-purchase display all compactly      together in a single self-promoting retain inventory unit. </PAR><PAR>  The invention will generally be made of corrugated cardboard, though fiber      board, plastic, and even metal may be adapted for some portions of the      display if needed. Fabrication will be well understood by the those      skilled in the art of point-of-purchase advertisement production. </PAR><PAR>  II. Utility of the Invention </PAR><PAR>  The invention is readily mailable, compact, inexpensive (because it is made      of flat materials which can be readily fabricated on a conventional      printer-slotter), and is adaptable to be used as a display in three      different modes which can be chosen by the retailer who receives the      mailing. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a schematic of the main planar element of the invention (shown      hatched) with easel elements attached. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a schematic of a standard-holder. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a schematic of a foldable standard for engaging elements 43 and      53 of FIG. 1. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 shows the standard of FIG. 3 assembled into the standard-holder of      FIG. 2 which is attached over a conventional product container. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5 shows the device assembled with standard and base. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 6 shows the device assembled with easel on a countertop. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 7 shows the device being slid into a common frame for display. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 depicts a plan view of the main planar element of the invention. The      display sheet 10 is shown with crosshatching for clarity and includes      slots 20 and 21 for holding a pad of coupons or order blanks (now shown)      and roundings 30 which interact with scoring 32 to permit edge portions 36      to be folded up at right angles to the main sheet 10. </PAR><PAR>  Support sheet 40 has a center panel 42 defined by longitudinal scores 44      and 46, locking fold-out 52 and top fold-out 54. Center portions 42 and 43      are glued to main sheet 10 with suitable adhesive, but fold-outs 52 and 54      and easel portions 50 and 51 of the support sheet 40 are all unglued and      are free to fold out at 90 degrees to the main sheet 10. Cut-out portions      of fold-outs 52 and 54 are shown with close crosshatching. </PAR><PAR>  In operation in the easel mode, easel portions 50 and 51 are first swung      out at right angles to the main sheet 10, then fold-out 52 is swung down      and out at right angle to main sheet 10, so detents 60 and 61 engage      detents 62 and 63 respectively, of easel portions 50 and 51, locking them      at right angles to main sheet 10, and permitting the assembly to stand up      and display the reverse fact of main sheet 10 which is imprinted with      suitable point of purchase advertising material. </PAR><PAR>  Alternately, elements 10 and 40 can remain flat and can be inserted into a      permanent display frame. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 depicts the standard-holder and FIG. 3 depicts the standard of the      invention, both useable in a display standard mode of employing the      invention. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 shows the standard-holder used to hold erect the standard (post)      shown in FIG. 3. Standard 80 is cut from corrugated cardboard or fiber      board. Cap collar 82 has a cut-out 84 adapted for engaging the neck or cap      of a container such as the motor oil bottle shown in FIG. 4. Cap collar      portion 82 has a second cut-out 86 adapted to receive the triangular      standard 100 shown in FIG. 3. Alternatively, standard cut-out 87 can be      included into a separate fold-out at a lower elevation than cut-out 84.      Cap collar portion 82 is adapted to fold along fold lines (shown dotted)      to approximately right angles with the main body of the standard-holder      80. A second stabilizing triangular hole 86 for holding the standard 100      at a different elevation point is provided on fold-out tab 84, also      adapted to be folded out from the main body of the standard-holder 80 at      approximately right angles. Another fold-out tab 88 is adapted to be      folded inward so as to form a &quot;C&quot; shape with cap collar portion 82 as      shown in FIG. 4. An optional cut-out 90 can provide lightness and may      engage extensions on the bottom of the motor oil bottle or other      container. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 shows the standard (post) element of the invention which is used in      the display mode which consists of three vertical portions divided by fold      lines (shown dotted), 102, 104, 106, and 108, each having cut-out slots      112, 114, 116, and 118, respectively. These cut-out slots can be at the      top of the standard so as to engage the slight tabs shown in the cut-out      in fold-out 54 of the display. To simplify mailing, the standard 100 can      be folded at horizontal fold line 120 (shown dotted) and additional fold      lines can be provided to reduce the length of standard 100 to convenient      mailing size. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 shows the standard-holder 80 and the standard 100 assembled and      mated with a product container, a motor oil bottle in which the collar      cut-out 84 can be slipped over the top of the bottle, and the standard 100      inserted into cut-outs 86 and 87. As mentioned above, the standard-holder      80 can be discarded and the standard, instead, alternatively stabbed      between the individual containers in a packed carton of product after the      top of the carton has been opened or removed, or among the packed      containers in an open-top tray, commonly used in a packaging of motor      oils. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 5, 6 and 7 show the standard mounting, the easel support mounting and      the frame mounting respectively. </PAR><PAC>  MODIFICATIONS </PAC><PAR>  Specific compositions, methods, or embodiments discussed are intented to be      only illustrative of the invention disclosed by this specification.      Variation on these compositions, methods, or embodiments are readily      apparent to a person of skill in the art based upon the teachings of this      specification and are therefore intended to be included as part of the      inventions disclosed herein. </PAR><PAR>  Reference to documents made in the specification is intended to result in      such patents or literature being expressly incorporated herein by      reference including any patents or other literature references cited      within such documents. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
