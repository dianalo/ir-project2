The civil lawsuit, filed by Resolution Trust Corp. under thefederal racketeering statute, was the government's largest filingagainst a thrift. It also alleges negligence, breach of fiduciaryduty and breach of contract.   The alleged wrongdoing involves Lincoln Savings and Loan, awholly owned subsidiary of American Continental Corp. of Phoenix.Defendants named by the lawsuit included company founder Charles H.Keating Jr., his wife, and various Keating relatives and companyexecutives.   The lawsuit charges fraud in the takeover of Lincoln andsubsequent mismanagement that squandered the thrift's assets,diverted ``enormous'' sums to the parent company and benefitedAmerican Continental and its executives at Lincoln's expense.   American Continental was not named in the complaint because itfiled for reorganization under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy lawsin April and received an automatic stay.   The $1.1 billion sought in damages surpasses a $500 million claimagainst Sunbelt Savings and Loan. Federal racketeering laws allowthe government to seek triple damages from defendants.   Federal regulators seized Lincoln on April 14, the day afterAmerican Continental filed for protection from creditors.   American Continental attorney A. Melvin McDonald said: ``We willvigorously defend the case and we fully believe that once all theinformation comes out we believe that all of the individuals namedwill be vindicated.''   The lawsuit contends that beginning in 1983, Keating and fourother American Continental officers schemed to divert funds from thethrift for their own use. The five are accused of racketeering. Thelawsuit names a total of 20 individuals and 17 business enterprises.   ``The implementation of this scheme involved concealing from theregulatory authorities, first, the true intentions for acquiring(Lincoln Savings) and, next, the actual operation of the thrift,''the suit states.   The lawsuit states that prior to 1984 the defendants operated anAmerican Continental enterprise comprised of about 17 corporationsprimarily focused on speculative real estate transactions.   It alleges that around 1983, American Continental's enterprisesneeded additional funds to expand its real estate transactions.   The lawsuit claims that American Continental acquired LincolnSavings by making ``material misprepresentations'' to the FederalHome Loan Bank Board, the former agency regulating the nation'ssavings and loans.   It also alleges that once Lincoln Savings became a subsidiary,money was diverted to the parent; insider loans, bad loans and badinvestmests were made; and transactions were manipulated to enhancethe American Continental and its insiders.   A recurring element in the transactions, the lawsuit claims, wasthat Lincoln Savings turned over cash for American Continentalallegedly to pay the thrift's income taxes, even though no taxeswere currently due.   Keating and his advisors also face a dozen class-action suitsfiled by about 23,000 bondholders. American Continental hasresponded by suing the FHLBB and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. toremove Lincoln from federal conservatorship.</TEXT></DOC>
