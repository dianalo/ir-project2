The study by researchers for the Urban Institute and PrincetonUniversity said 71 percent of the decline in apprehensions along theU.S.-Mexico border appears due to the ``deterrent effect'' of the1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act.   Frank Bean of the Urban Institute and one of the study's authors,said the sanctions against employers who hire undocumented workersare the only real deterrent in the law, so ``it is not unrealisticto think that most (of the deterrent effect) is due to sanctions, ifnot all.''   Dan Stein, executive director of the Federation for AmericanImmigration Reform, said the study provides the first majorempirical evidence that sanctions are effective.   ``It shows that many people who don't have unbridled motivationto get around the law are discouraged from coming. ... It is aratification of what we have been saying all along,'' Stein said.   Using a statistical model, the study said the control act isassociated with a cumulative net reduction in apprehensions ofnearly 700,000 people, or 35 percent, below what would have beenanticipated if circumstances had not changed in the 23-month periodfollowing the law's enactment in November 1986.   Apprensions are considered the best available indicator of theflow of illegal immigration across the southern border.   About 12 percent of the decline is due to changes in theImmigration and Naturalization Service's efforts, another 17 percentis due to the law's agricultural legalization program, and theremaining 71 percent is due to the ``deterrent effect,'' the studysaid.   In addition to the sanctions, the law's major features includelegalization programs for which more than 3 million undocumentedimmigrants applied, and stepped up enforcement at the southernborder.   INS spokesman Verne Jervis said the study ``supports ourcontention that IRCA is effective in reducing the flow of illegalaliens across the southern border. We think sanctions are a majorfactor in the sharp decline in apprehensions and illegal bordercrossings.''   But Rep. Albert Bustamante, a Texas Democrat whose districtincludes a stretch of border from Laredo to Del Rio, said he doesnot believe the flow of illegal immigration is down.</TEXT></DOC>
