Gaffney Jr.</HL><DD> 12/08/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> FRESTEXECUTIVE (EXE) </IN><TEXT>   Moscow's strategy for Super-Summit, the biggest football game of the season, can be summed up in three words: Move the ball. The Moscow Maverix, under the leadership of Mike &quot;Gorby&quot; Gorbachev, will try to keep the pressure on veteran Gipper Reagan and his Washington team, gaining yardage wherever possible. The stakes for defeat are high, since under the unique rules of this league, the following game will start with the score and field position with which this game leaves off.    The Gipper should expect Moscow to mount a particularly powerful ground game in the arms-control area. There may be some fancy backfield maneuvering, but the Soviet strategy here will be to run the ball at every opportunity, drawing upon the Maverix' heavy offensive foursome -- Dobrynin, Bessmertnykh, Karpov and Ogarkov (known as the &quot;Refrigerator&quot; to his admirers) -- and exploiting weak blocking in the Washington line.    Naturally, the Soviets expect to score early in the game with the signing of the INF treaty. Moscow clearly hopes to achieve decisive momentum, overcoming concerns about past Soviet foul plays and quashing Washington's defensive line on verification.    The big power play, however, will probably come on Start. Moscow sees a window for moving the ball decisively in this area and will probably press hard for the touchdown. The Maverix likely will be content with a field goal; though if the clock is running out on the Washington team, Gorby will surely settle for a framework agreement, perhaps called &quot;Instructions to Negotiators,&quot; which will lock in future American quarterbacks to strategic and tactical plays advantageous to Moscow.    Of course, in his negotiations on Start, the Gipper will have to be ready for Gorby's favorite move -- a wily variation on the quarterback sneak. Gorby has run it several times before: The crowd is hushed; expectations are high. Just when it seems as though victory is inevitable and an agreement is about to be signed, Gorby links it all to new constraints on SDI.    The Gipper has assured his fans that he's not going to let Gorby get away with that play this time, any more than he has in the past. But the Gipper best be alert; the Maverix have been running some new patterns for this scenario and instead of watching for the break through the center, he should look for the end run to kill SDI. For example, the Soviets seem to feel pretty confident that the old &quot;Non-Withdrawal from the ABM Treaty for X Years&quot; gambit will not only ensure they win this game but also lock in first-round draft picks for generations to come.    The Gip should also look for the Soviets to take to the air in a couple of areas. Gorby may throw the &quot;long bomb&quot; on the agreed need for urgent progress on a chemical warfare ban, new nuclear testing limitations and negotiations on a &quot;third zero-option&quot; aimed at eliminating the remaining nuclear forces from Europe. Moscow believes Washington's defensive backfield is not up to covering the fleet-footed Soviet receivers, whose agility and derring-do on occasion earn them the admiration and cheers of even some in the Gipper's bleachers.    It is more difficult to predict the Soviet game plan on regional issues. The Maverix have tried out various running and passing combinations in previous contests. They probably will do what they are particularly good at these days: the old razzle-dazzle. We will see them all over the field-calling for a &quot;peace process&quot; here and there, superpower cooperation as a vehicle to resolve regional conflicts, or &quot;reinvigoration&quot; of the (happily) moribund United Nations. Probably nothing will come of it, but the crowd will &quot;ooh&quot; and &quot;aah&quot; at their footwork and ball-handling, convinced that the boys from Moscow play in the big leagues.    Gorby's strategy on human rights is clear: Sack the quarterback. The Gipper should expect strong Soviet defensive plays. The Maverix will deny they have any human-rights problems while charging that it is the U.S. that systematically deprives its citizens of social equality and other basic rights. The key play will come when the Soviets try to draw in Washington's offensive line by obtaining the Gipper's agreement to participate -- and thereby dignify -- a conference on human rights to be held, believe it or not, in Moscow. If Washington falls for this feint, you can be sure that the Gipper and his agenda in this area will indeed get sacked.    Finally, the Soviets have perfected a series of plays on bilateral relations known as the &quot;Bilateral Blitz.&quot; Since the early '70s, Moscow has run essentially the same detente pattern against Washington and, with the notable exception of the first six years of the Reagan administration, it has met with considerable success.    This is how it probably will shape up at the Super-Summit: Moscow will go for broke on all fronts -- send receivers deep for technology transfer, industrial cooperation ventures and credits, and access to U.S. research, space, undersea and other programs with considerable military applicability. Moscow expects to connect with someone, especially if the Gipper, his teammates and his cheering section are so in awe of Gorby's performance in other aspects of the game as to lose sight of fundamental administration policies and national interests.    A closing comment: Keeping in mind the Maverix strategy and tactics for the Super-Summit, the Gipper and his team should be able to perform ably and avoid many of the maneuvers Gorby has in store. It is imperative that the home team do so because, after all, this is no game; both sides are playing for keeps.    ---   Mr. Gaffney, a visiting fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, was nominated to be assistant secretary of defense earlier this year. When Frank Carlucci took over for Caspar Weinberger, his nomination was withdrawn. </TEXT></DOC>
