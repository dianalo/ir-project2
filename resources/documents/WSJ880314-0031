How many are doing as well at taming the bear that stalks among stocks today?    In a study by The Asian Wall Street Journal of 175 equity funds monitored by the Hong Kong Unit Trust Association, the results show that hardly any funds did better than market indexes both before and after the crash. And some of the hottest pre-crash performers are now catching a chill in the cellar.    The study also discloses striking swings in patterns of profitability, lending credence to the argument that fund performance is best judged in terms of years rather than of months.    The analysis ignored October and looked at how funds performed in the one-year and five-year bullish periods through last September. It compared those returns with fund performance from November through January, the first full quarter of the current bear market, to see how well fund managers are bouncing back.    The results indicate that performance hasn't even approached consistency over time. Japanese funds were at the back of the pack during the final year of the bull, when smaller Asian markets were shining. But in the bear quarter and the long-term bull, Japanese funds generated some of the best returns.    Funds that invest in Hong Kong and Australia -- among the world's most volatile markets -- fell from the top ranks in the final year of the bull and have been residing near the bottom since the bear began.    U.S. and European funds, when they show up at all, tend to appear among the laggards. Fund managers say that isn't surprising because the economies of the Asia-Pacific region are growing more quickly than those of North America or Europe. They note, however, that Britain's market has been a consistently good performer for the past several years.    Not one fund ranked in the top 20 in all three periods. None ranked in the bottom 20, either. But six funds, all investing in Southeast Asia or Australia, plummeted from the top 20 during the last year of the bull market into the bottom ranks during the bear quarter.    Two former leaders, Gartmore Hong Kong Fund and Thornton Hong Kong andamp; China Gateway Fund, dropped about 14%. Baring Australia Fund, GAM Australia Inc. and Thornton Kangaroo Fund sank more than 17%. And Gartmore Oriental Ventures Trust fell about 10%. All had more than doubled during the last year of the bull.    Jim Mellon, former managing director of Thornton Management (Asia) Ltd., says such highfliers were hit particularly hard because many were &quot;geared,&quot; meaning they borrowed against holdings to buy additional shares. Many also had invested heavily in shares of smaller companies.    &quot;The second-liners not only fell further than blue chips, but they were more illiquid,&quot; says Mr. Mellon, who is joining British-based fund managers Tyndall Holdings Ltd. as marketing director. &quot;That forced managers to sell what blue chips they had to meet redemptions, leaving them with only the poorer performers.&quot;    Only three funds -- Jardine Fleming Pacific Securities Trust and Jardine Fleming Pacific Income Trust, both Asian equity trusts, and Jardine Fleming Japan Trust -- outperformed the relevant market indexes over all three time periods. All three are run by Jardine Fleming Asset Management Ltd. here.    Pacific Income Trust was the best performer of all funds over five years, turning in an impressive gain of 1,318%. The fund uses an unusual strategy of investing in convertible bonds. The bonds offer relatively high yields, and when the share price is favorable, can be converted to common stock to take capital gains.    Martin Dixon, a Jardine fund manager, says the fund lately has constructed synthetic convertibles by buying matched amounts of straight bonds and warrants. The bonds provide income. The warrants give the fund the right to buy a company's shares at a set price, providing capital-gains potential. Much of the fund has been invested in Japanese securities, he says.    &quot;This sort of fund doesn't provide the highest short-term return in bull markets,&quot; he says. &quot;But over time it gives managers the opportunity to shift assets. We can take profits in one market and go elsewhere where opportunities are better.&quot;    Taking the Financial Times world index as an overall standard, only two other funds with a five-year history outperformed the index in all three time periods: Wardley Japan Fund and G.T. Asia Fund. Both reflect the vitality of the Japanese market, as well as a relatively conservative investment policy that avoids holding large numbers of speculative stocks.    Two international funds, Schroders Asia International Fund and Jardine Fleming International Trust, came within a hair of topping the index in all three periods.    &quot;At any time, there is almost always one market that outperforms diversified funds,&quot; says Mr. Dixon. &quot;International funds perform well over time, and should outperform others in tricky markets.&quot;    Just five funds underperformed the indexes in all three periods. Four were Australian funds: G.T. Australia Fund, Gartmore Australia Trust, Jardine Fleming Australia Trust, and MIM Britannia Australian Fund. The other was Sun Hung Kai Hong Kong Equity Fund. All had losses in the bear quarter, when some similar funds crept back to profitability.    ---   World Market Activity   Tokyo share prices Friday closed at 25,543.73, down 74.09 yen, in response to the 48.24 point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average Thursday. After falling sharply at the opening of trading, stocks rebounded by the end of the morning and eased down during the afternoon.    The modest decline in the Nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues masked the market's broad weakness, however, as advances by bank and other financial issues, which make up a large portion of the weighted Nikkei, saved the average from a steeper decline.    The Nikkei index ended Monday's morning session at 25505.78, down 37.95 points.    In Friday's trading, London share prices closed sharply lower in brisk trading, as market sentiment was hurt by the drop in New York and investors were prompted to take profits on Thursday's strong gains.    The Financial Times 30-share index fell 22.4 points to 1449.9. The 100-share index was down 23 points at 1811.6.    Stocks also closed lower in Frankfurt, Paris, Zurich, Brussels and Amsterdam, and rose in Stockholm and Milan.    Stocks were lower in Singapore, Taipei, Wellington and Seoul, and were mixed in Sydney, Hong Kong and Manila.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end.    % This                             Mar 10     Mar 9     Year    U.S. .................... 243.2     247.8    +  6.0    Britain ................. 555.9     550.4    +  7.8    Canada .................. 364.9     367.6    +  4.1    Japan .................. 1237.4    1238.8    + 21.0    France .................. 307.7     307.9    +  6.6    Germany ................. 170.3     169.6    +  8.7    Hong Kong .............. 1853.9    1831.2    + 12.7    Switzerland ............. 159.1     158.0    + 13.0    Australia ............... 269.7     266.3    +  4.0    World index ............. 446.7     448.8    +  9.5</TEXT></DOC>
