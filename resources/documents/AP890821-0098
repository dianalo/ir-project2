Adapted from the 1926 Fritz Lang film, the show opened to poorreviews March 8 at the Piccadilly Theater, with critics praisingonly Ralph Koltai's massive, pipe-filled sets.   Composer and co-lyricist Brooks is best known for hisOscar-winning song ``You Light Up My Life.''   Brian Blessed, the original Old Deuteronomy from ``Cats,'' andJudy Kuhn, a Broadway veteran of ``Chess'' and ``Les Miserables,''were the original stars, although Kuhn has since been replaced byMary Lincoln.   Its closing follows a summer that has seen an unusual number ofWest End shows struggling to survive amid unusually warm weatherthat has kept Londoners and visitors alike out of theaters, many ofwhich are not air conditioned.   A series of weekly subway strikes did not help business.   Only the various Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals, ``LesMiserables,'' and Dustin Hoffman's London stage debut in ``TheMerchant of Venice'' have done consistently strong business.   Aside from the works of Lloyd Webber, Trevor Nunn and John Caird,few London musicals have succeeded in the past few years, and eventhe critically acclaimed local staging of Stephen Sondheim's``Follies'' ended in February in the red after a 19-month run.</TEXT></DOC>
