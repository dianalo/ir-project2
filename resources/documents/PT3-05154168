To achieve this, a connecting adapter (2) with connecting ports (4, 10)      can be fastened in at least two preferred positions on the full mask or      half mask (1). A predetermined number of connection openings 8, 9 and      connecting ports (4, 10) overlap in each preferred position. Various      numbers of filters 3 can be connected to the overlapping areas, and the      non-overlapping connection openings 8 are closed with sealing means 7      provided on the connecting adapter 2. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  FIELD OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The present invention pertains to a respirator mask with connection      openings for filters and a mask body, which is designed as a full mask or      a half mask. </PAR><PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  A respirator mask with a mask body designed as a full mask has become known      from West German Patent Specification No. DE-PS 17,08,046. This prior art      respirator mask comprises a mask body with connection openings for filters      and flutter valves and an internal half mask. The mask body is designed      such that its shape, or the form in which it is manufactured, does not      have to be changed when the connection ports for the filters or the      flutter valves are to be installed. To achieve this, the mask body has      desired points when needed and used to connect one or several filters or      one or several flutter valves as desired. A defined respirator mask      configuration is manufactured such that a single-piece mask body without      openings is first prepared, recesses are subsequently punched through in      the desired positions, and filters and/or flutter valves are fastened at      the connections thus formed. </PAR><PAR>  One drawback of the prior-art respirator mask is that the field of      application of the respirator mask, e.g., as a single-filter respirator      mask or as a two-filter respirator mask, is defined by the openings, once      punched. Conversion to another respirator mask configuration is possible      only if connecting ports that are no longer needed are closed by auxiliary      parts. If, for example, a two-filter respirator mask with one flutter      valve is converted into a single-filter respirator mask, an additional      flutter valve must be inserted in place of the second filter, or a      separate closing plug must be placed into the connection opening in the      mask body. In addition, the prior art respirator mask involves the risk      that recesses will be inadvertently punched through during the use of the      respirator, and the respirator mask will therefore no longer be suitable      for use because of the leak developed. </PAR><PAR>  A half mask with connection openings for fastening filters and flutter      valves has become known from West German Utility Patent No. DE-GM      16,25,097. According to a first embodiment of this prior art reference,      two filters are arranged on the side of the half mask, and the flutter      valve is located on the front side of the half mask in front of the mouth.      In a second embodiment, only one filter is to be inserted into the      connection opening of the flutter valve, and the breathing air is allowed      to flow off via a rubber lip valve on the underside of the half mask. The      lateral connection openings are closed in this state. </PAR><PAR>  It is disadvantageous in the prior-art half mask that conversion from the      configuration with two filters to that with a single filter is possible      only if the connection openings that are no longer needed on the side are      sealed by means of auxiliary parts. In the opposite case, i.e., in the      case of conversion from one filter to two filters, a loose flutter valve      must be installed in the half mask in place of the single filter, and the      rubber lip valve on the underside must be closed. Consequently, the      possibility of conversion is limited by the availability of certain      auxiliary components. This method of conversion has not proved to be      usable in practical application. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY AND OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  It is a primary object of the present invention to improve a respirator      mask such that subsequent conversion to one respirator mask configuration      or another will be simplified and possible without the use of separate      closing parts. </PAR><PAR>  According to the invention, a connecting adapter with connecting ports can      be fastened on the full mask or half mask in at least two preferred      positions. A predetermined number of connection openings and connecting      ports overlap each other in each preferred position. Various numbers of      filters can be connected in the overlapping areas, and the non-overlapping      connection openings are closed with sealing means provided on the      connecting adapter. </PAR><PAR>  The essential advantage of the present invention relates to the fact that      different respirator mask configurations can be realized with the      connecting adaptor. This connecting adaptor is fastened in different      preferred positions on the respirator mask, and defines connecting ports,      into which connection openings filters can be inserted. At least one of      the connecting ports are overlapped or aligned with connection openings on      the respirator mask in each preferred position of the connecting adapter.      Auxiliary parts for closing unused connection openings are not necessary,      because these are closed with sealing means provided on the connecting      adapter. The connecting ports in the connecting adapter are provided      either as circular openings in the wall of the connecting adapter or as      threaded bushings or plug-in type sockets. </PAR><PAR>  Such a connecting adapter can be fastened either in a respirator mask with      a full mask and internal mask or directly on a half mask. </PAR><PAR>  In the case of the full mask, the connecting adapter is placed over the      connection openings in the area of the mouth, and a predetermined number      of connection openings and connecting ports will overlap in each preferred      position. The connection openings are circular openings in the full mask.      In the case of a rigid full mask, it is advantageous to make the      connecting adapter from a flexible material in order for it to cling to      the contours of the full mask. To seal off the overlapping areas of the      connection openings and the connecting ports between the connecting      adapter and the full mask against the atmosphere, annular sealing beads      may be provided on the inside of the connecting adapter. The sealing beads      prevent respiration gas from escaping from the overlapping areas into the      atmosphere. The connecting adapter may also be designed as a changeover      switch which is fastened on the full mask or is even part of the full mask      and can be brought into the corresponding preferred position by rotating. </PAR><PAR>  In the case of the half mask, the connecting adapter is directly attached      to the half mask, and the filters are buttoned into the half mask. Since      the half mask usually consists of a rubber-elastic material, the sealing      function is assumed at the same time by the buttoning. </PAR><PAR>  The respirators are usually used as single-filter and two-filter respirator      masks. With the respirator mask according to the present invention, a      single-filter respirator mask can be realized in a first preferred      position, and a two-filter respirator mask can be realized in a second      preferred position. In the single-filter respirator mask, the filter is      fastened on the front side of the connecting adapter at the level of the      mouth, whereas in the case of the two-filter respirator mask, the filters      are arranged on the side flanks of the connecting adapter. Filters of      identical design can be used for both configurations of the respirator      mask, i.e., the single-filter respirator mask and the two-filter      respirator mask. </PAR><PAR>  The connecting adapter is designed such that it surrounds the side flanks      of the half mask or of the full mask and is designed to hold the filters.      In the case of a half mask, the connecting adapter is preferably made from      a solid material and serves as a support for the half mask, because it is      in contact with the elastic side flanks in a U-shaped pattern. Since the      intrinsic weight of the filters is taken up completely by the connecting      adapter, the half mask can be designed for exclusive sealing function and      be manufactured from a soft, pliant material, e.g., silicone. </PAR><PAR>  To improve the wearing comfort, the connecting adapter for a half mask is      provided with bands to fasten the respirator mask on the respirator user's      head. Due to the uniform introduction of the holding force over the front      side and the side flanks of the half mask, uniform pressing against the      face is achieved. </PAR><PAR>  On the side facing the respirator mask, the connecting adapter is provided      with closing plugs serving as sealing means, which can be buttoned into      the non-overlapping connection openings and seal same. Buttoning in brings      about reliable closure of the connection openings and does not lead to      leakage even in the case of extreme deformation of the respirator mask. </PAR><PAR>  In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, pit-like, rectangular      recesses, which serve to center the filters and to secure them against      rotation, are provided in the area of the connecting ports. The filters      have a matching counterpart, which extends into the recess and is designed      such that the filter can be fastened on the connecting adapter only in a      defined position. Subsequent adjustment of the filter on the connecting      adapter to achieve favorable wearing position for the respirator's user is      no longer necessary. </PAR><PAR>  The various features of novelty which characterize the invention are      pointed out with particularity in the claims annexed to and forming a part      of this disclosure. For a better understanding of the invention, its      operating advantages and specific objects attained by its uses, reference      is made to the accompanying drawings and descriptive matter in which      preferred embodiments of the invention are illustrated. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  In the drawings: </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a side view of a respirator mask with one filter according to the      invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a longitudinal view of the respirator mask according to FIG. 1; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 shows a sectional view of a detail from FIG. 2 taken along line      A--A; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is a respirator mask according to FIGS. 1 through 3 with the      connecting adapter replugged to fasten two filters; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5 is a front view of a respirator mask as a full mask with two      filters; and </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 6 is a sectional view of a respirator mask as a full mask with two      filters. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 shows the side view of a respirator mask 20 with a half mask 1 made      from a rubber-elastic material, a connecting adapter 2 made from a solid      material, one filter 3, a band 17, and a flutter valve 5. The respirator      mask 20 is of symmetrical design; therefore, only one half is shown in      FIGS. 1, 2, and 4. Symmetric components are designated by the same      reference numerals with the suffix &quot;a&quot; added. </PAR><PAR>  The connecting adapter 2 is placed onto the half mask 1 in a first      preferred position, and in this position, it permits a single filter 3 to      be fastened. The connecting adapter 2 surrounds, in the shape of a U, the      elastic half mask 1, and the connecting adapter thus acts as a support for      its side flanks. In the upper area of the connecting adapter 2, two      connecting ports 4, 4a are provided as circular openings in the wall of      the connecting adapter 2. The second connecting adapter 4a is located on      the rear side and is not shown in FIG. 1. In the area of the connecting      adapters 4, 4a, there is a rectangular, pit-like recess 6, 6a, which      serves as a centering aid and as a rotation prevention means for the      filters 3 to be mounted later. In the lower area of the connecting adapter      2, there are two closing plugs 7, 7a, which are provided on the inside of      the connecting adapter 2 and point toward the half mask 1. The band 17 is      guided in an oval eye 18, and can be adapted to the head of a respirator      user (not shown) by displacement in the vertical direction. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 shows a vertical section through the respirator mask 20 according to      FIG. 1. The half mask 1 of FIG. 2 has two closed connection openings 8, 8a      and one filter connection opening 9. The connection openings 8, 8a, 9 are      openings provided in the rubber-elastic wall of the half mask 1. In the      position of the connecting adapter 2 shown, the connection openings 8, 8a      are sealed with the closing plugs 7, 7a, which are part of the connecting      adapter 2. The filter 3 is buttoned into the filter connection opening 9      of the half mask 1. The filter 3 is held in the filter connecting port 10      and is centered by a filter recess 11 of the connecting adapter 2. The      filter connecting port 10 is designed as a circular opening in the wall of      the connecting adapter 2. A matching counterpart of the filter 3 engages      in the rectangular, pit-like filter recess 11, thus holding the filter 3      in the predetermined position. In the upper area of the connecting adapter      2, a filter closing plug 12, which extends into a filter recess 13 of the      half mask 1, is provided on the inside. Corresponding recesses 14, 14a are      provided on the side flanks of the half mask 1. The half mask 1 also has a      circumferential sealing bead 21, which is in contact with the face of the      respirator user (not shown). A directional valve 22 is provided to      interrupt the flow of gas through the filter 3 during breathing out. The      expired gas thus can escape only through the flutter valve 5. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 shows a sectional view of a detail from FIG. 2 along line A--A, in      which the symmetrically arranged connection openings 8, 8a and closing      plugs 7, 7a are recognizable. The filter 3 consists of a screw type      housing 15, into which a filter cartridge 16 with a gasket 19 is inserted.      To change the filter, the housing 15 is screwed on, and the filter      cartridge is replaced. It is not necessary to button the filter 3 out of      the filter connection opening 9. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 shows a respirator mask 20 with a connecting adapter 2, which is      placed onto the half mask 1 in a second preferred position, and permits      the connection of two filters 3 in this position. The conversion from the      single-filter respirator mask according to FIGS. 1 through 3 to a      two-filter respirator mask according to FIG. 4 is carried out by first      buttoning the filter 3 and the closing plugs 7, 7a out of the connection      openings 8, 8a, 9 (FIG. 3). The connecting adapter 2 is subsequently      pulled off of the half mask 1, turned through 180.degree. around a      horizontal axis, and put back in place. In the new position (FIG. 4), the      filter connecting port 10 is opposite the filter recess 13, and the      closing plugs 7, 7a extend into the recesses 14, 14a (FIG. 2 and FIG. 4).      Since the sides of the connecting adapter 2 are now inverted relative to      the half mask 1, the closing plug 7a is now in the recess 14 and the      closing plug 7 is in the recess 14a. </PAR><PAR>  The filter connection opening 9 is sealed with the filter closing plug 12.      The connecting ports 4, 4a overlap the connection openings 8, 8a of the      half mask 1, and two filters 3 can be inserted here. These filters 3 are      not shown in FIG. 4. </PAR><PAR>  The filters 3 are centered on the connecting adapter 2 via the recesses 6,      6a. Filters 3 of identical design can be used for both configurations of      the respirator mask, i.e., as a single-filter respirator mask or as a      two-filter respirator mask. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5 shows the front view of a respirator full mask 30 with a mask body      designed as a full mask 36. A connecting adapter 32, two filters 33, 33a,      a band 47, and a flutter valve 35 are connected to the full mask 36. The      full mask 36 has connection openings 38, 38a (FIG. 6) and one filter      connection opening 39, which are designed as circular openings in the wall      of the full mask 36. The connecting adapter 32 is placed onto the full      mask 36 in a second preferred position, and it permits two filters 33, 33a      to be fastened in this position. In the lower area of the connecting      adapter 32, two connecting ports 34, 34a are provided to accommodate the      filters 33, 33a. A filter connecting port 40 is located in the upper area,      and is used with one centrally arranged filter in the first preferred      position. The connecting ports 34, 34a, 40 are designed as threaded      bushes. Closing plugs 37, 37a and one filter closing plug 42, point toward      the full mask 36, serve to close connection openings 38, 38 a, 39, are      provided on the inside of the connecting adapter 32. In the position      shown, the filter connection opening 39 is sealed with the filter closing      plug 42, and the connection openings 38, 38a (FIG. 6) overlap the      connecting ports 34, 34a. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 6 shows a sectional view of the respirator full mask 30 according to      FIG. 5. The direction of gas flow is indicated by arrows. The gas enters      via the connecting ports 34, 34a, the connection openings 38, 38a, and the      directional valves 351, 352, sweeps over the lens 43, and enters the      interior space of the inner mask 31 via a check valve 44. The exhaled air      is discharged into the atmosphere via the flutter valve 35. In the second      preferred position of the connecting adapter 32 with one filter, there is      an equivalent gas pathway. Inside the connecting ports 34, 34a, 40, the      connecting adapter 32 is provided with circumferential sealing beads 45,      45a, which seal the overlapping areas against the atmosphere. </PAR><PAR>  The two-filter respirator full mask is converted into a single-filter      respirator full mask by pulling off the connecting adapter 32 and putting      it back in a position rotated through 180.degree.. In the new position      (not shown in the figures), the closing plugs 37, 37a are in the      connection openings 38, 38a, and the filter connecting port 40 overlaps      the filter connection opening 39. The connecting ports 34, 34a, 40 shown      here are designed for screw type connection of the filters 33, 33a;      however, it is also possible to use plug connection. Filters 33, 33a of      identical design can be used for both configurations, i.e., as a      single-filter respirator mask or as a two-filter respirator mask. </PAR><PAR>  While specific embodiments of the invention have been shown and described      in detail to illustrate the application of the principles of the      invention, it will be understood that the invention may be embodied      otherwise without departing from such principles. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
