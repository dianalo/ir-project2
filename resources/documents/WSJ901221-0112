LOUIS -- McDonnell Douglas Corp. and General DynamicsCorp. said they are notifying a total of 8,000 employees --as early as Jan. 2 if the troubled A-12 Navy attack planeprogram is canceled.   The announcements came as the two aerospace concernsnegotiate with the Navy and aides to Defense Secretary DickCheney to try to salvage the program, which has been plaguedby engineering snafus and cost overruns. The Pentagonthreatened to cancel the program, and earlier this week gavethe contractors until Jan. 2 to come up with a plan to solvethe problems.</LP><TEXT>   Yet despite the public threats, all parties appear to beworking toward a compromise that would probably slowdevelopment of the A-12 and impose some kind of financialpenalty on the two companies for past mistakes, but stillkeep the plane alive.   McDonnell Douglas's McDonnell Aircraft Co. unit has about6,000 employees in the program, mostly in St. Louis, andGeneral Dynamics has 4,000, mostly in Fort Worth, Texas. Bothcompanies said the employees being notified of the potentiallayoffs won't be limited to those working on the A-12.</TEXT></DOC>
