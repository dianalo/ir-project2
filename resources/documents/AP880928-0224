Brezhnev, refused Tuesday to testify further in hiscorruption trial and got into a courtroom argument with aprosecutor, Tass reported.   On Monday, the 51-year-old Churbanov had outlined his responseto charges that he accepted bribes as one of the country's toppolice officials, a first deputy interior minister, duringBrezhnev's rule.   ``You have my written testimony and you're well familiar withit, so I'm not going to repeat anything,'' the official Soviet newsagency quoted Churbanov as saying in court Tuesday.   ``I already refused to answer this question yesterday and Iwon't answer it today either.''   Churbanov, husband of Brezhnev's daughter Galina, took thewitness stand Monday for the first time in the trial, now in itsfourth week, and testified that he kept a $160,000 bribe because itwould have been too awkward to return.   Churbanov is standing trial before a military tribunal witheight others, all former police officials in the Central Asianrepublic of Uzbekistan. The case is expected to last several moreweeks. Churbanov is accused of accepting a total of $1.1 million inbribes and of abusing his office.   He could be put before a firing squad if found guilty.   At one point Tuesday, Tass reported, Churbanov told theprosecutor in reply to a question: ``So you and I started anincomprehensible altercation again.''   Judge Mikhail Marov interrupted to say: ``Nobody is going toallow you, Churbanov, to altercate. Don't forget you're in thedock.''   Tass did not say what questions were asked of Churbanov.   His lawyer, Andrei Makarov, said Churbanov's refusal to answerquestions was within his legal rights.   ``He categorically denies any bribe-taking, although he admitshaving received significant sums of money from Uzbekistan's partyleaders,'' Tass quoted Makarov as saying.   The trial is part of a campaign under Kremlin leader Mikhail S.Gorbachev to expose and correct the corruption and economic slumpthat plagued the country under Brezhnev, who ruled from 1964 untilhis death in 1982.</TEXT></DOC>
