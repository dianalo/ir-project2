<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-58-1188 </DOCNO><TEXT>The CESA-1 molten salts storage system has been evaluated since November1986. This evaluation provides useful experimental data for system modellingand characterization by determining: charge/discharge efficiencies, andhot/cold tank thermal losses. It was performed systematically, measuringinlet/outlet temperatures of steam/water/salt in the charge/dischargecircuit, using thermocouples, steam/water inlet/outlet pressure (pressuretransmissor), steam/water and salt flow (venturi-type flowmeters), andhot/cold salt temperature variation with time. Thirteen charge/dischargeand thermal loss tests were performed. Conclusions drawn from this evaluationare that the molten salts thermal storage system is efficient, practical,and reliable (Andujar, 1987).</TEXT></DOC>
