The magnetswere run at constant current at the SSC injection field level of 0.3tesla for one to three hours and changes in the magnetic field were observed.One explanation for the observed field decay is time dependent superconductormagnetization. Another explanation involves flux creep or flux flow.Data are presented on how the decay changes with previous flux history.Similar magnets with different Nb-Ti filament spacings and matrix materialshave different long time field decay. A theoretical model using proximitycoupling and flux creep for the observed field decay is discussed. 10refs., 5 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
