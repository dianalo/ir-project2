The police action capped Czechoslovakia's most serious week ofpolitical unrest since Jan Palach set himself ablaze in centralWenceslas Square in January 1969 and thousands of people took to thestreets in shock and grief.   Former Communist Party chief Alexander Dubcek was quoted Sundayas saying the young people now demonstrating against Communistauthorities are frustrated by a political and economic system thatoffers them no future.   Activist Petr Uhl said more than 400 protesters were arrested onSaturday in the village of Vsetaty, Palach's hometown 18 miles fromPrague. He said they had tried to hold a vigil at the heavilyguarded cemetery where Palach is buried. Police had blocked roadsand interrogated visitors on Saturday in an apparent attempt tothwart a large demonstration.   The arrests brought to 800 the number of people detained duringthe week of protests, most of which occurred in Wenceslas Square,where Palach set himself afire on Jan. 16, 1969.   In Warsaw, Poland, police detained two members of the bannedPolish Socialist Party during a demonstration today in support ofthe Czechoslovak dissidents detained, an opposition spokeswoman said.   Several dozen people gathered in front of the CzechoslovakEmbassy and shouted ``We are with the Czechs! The Czechs are withus!'' and ``Democracy in the whole bloc!'' said spokeswoman ZuzannaDabrowska.   She said Socialist Party members Piotr Ikonowicz and CezaryMirzejewski were detained.   The police presence was heavy in Prague and Vsetaty on Sunday andno protests were reported.   Uhl, a member of the Charter 77 human rights group, said policeon Saturday detained people who could not prove they were Vsetatyresidents. He said most were taken to a nearby state farm,questioned, photographed and released.   Two activists, Ludvik Marks of the independent youth group CzechChildren and Martin Litomirsky of the Democratic Initiative, wereapparently detained overnight, Uhl said.   The protests signal a growing frustration with the lack of socialand economic reforms similiar to those implemented by PresidentMikhail S. Gorbachev in the Soviet Union, said Dubcek, who wasousted as his country's leader for supporting the reforms thatSoviet troops crushed in 1968.   Dubcek, who lives in Bratislava, spoke about the current unrestin Czechoslovakia in a telephone interview with the ItalianCommunist Party daily l'Unita, which carried a front-page story onSunday.   ``There is a basic crisis that involves, above all, the youngpeople, the 20-year-old children of the Prague Spring ... who haveno future,'' he was quoted as saying.   ``What young people are asking for is a rebirth of the type underway in the Soviet Union, that involves even the party,'' Dubcek said.   Protest began Jan. 15 when about 5,000 activists tried to hold avigil for Palach in Wenceslas Square. Police broke up the gatheringwith tear gas and truncheons and arrested 117 people.   On Jan. 16, banned playwright Vaclav Havel, Czechoslovakia'sbest-known dissident, and 12 other activists were detained aftertrying to lay flowers in memory of Palach.   They were still in jailon Sunday, and fellow activists say itappears they will face charges that could jail them for up to two orthree years.   The youth newspaper Mlada Fronta said Saturday that 280 peoplewere detained Thursday during the week's worst violence, when riotpolice charged a crowd of more than 2,000 and beat several people inPrague.</TEXT></DOC>
