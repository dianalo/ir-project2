But while Bush and his supporters insist that politicalconsiderations did not figure in his Thursday appearance, theassignment did provide the vice president with a high-profile forum.   ``Any time you can go and speak forcefully about bringing peaceto this part of the world, it's worth doing,'' said Bush chief ofstaff Craig Fuller. ``He didn't do it for political reasons. I donot believe it will be harmful politically.''   After an angry 1{-hour denunciation of the United States byIranian Foreign Minister Ali-Akbar Velayati for ``barbaric acts,''Bush told the world organization the United States felt grief forthe loss of innocent lives that ``transcends political differencesand boundaries.''   But he also condemned Iran for allowing a civilian airlinercarrying 290 people ``to proceed on a path over a warship engagedin battle'' and said Iran must share responsibility for the tragedy.   Coming days before Democrats convene in Atlanta to installMichael Dukakis as their presidential nominee, Bush's appearancegave him high visibility in an area that he is presenting as one ofhis strong suits: foreign policy.   Still, it was the first time that Bush had been selected toaddress the Security Council in his 7{ years as vice president,even though he served there as U.S. ambassador under PresidentRichard Nixon in the early 1970s.   Bush told reporters President Reagan had decided to give him theassignment ``to put some real emphasis on the policy of the UnitedStates by elevating the level of representation.''   ``There's so much at stake, I'm not sure people have a heart fortalking about how it helps him politically,'' said campaign presssecretary Sheila Tate. ``This was serious business, it wasn'tpolitics.''   Bush more subdued in his UN presentation than he has been inrecent public appearances when he characterized the July 3 disasteras ``just an unhappy incident'' while telling audiences that ``lifegoes on.''   Departing from his prepared text, Bush turned to face Velayatiacross the semi-circular council table. Speaking in a calm voice,the vice president said: ``Of course we feel badly about it, ofcourse we have compassion. Of course we care.''   Aides said that Bush's presentation was written by three or fourWhite House speechwriters, with most of the ideas for its wordingcoming from him. The text was coordinated with both the StateDepartment and the National Security Council before Bush deliveredit, the aides said.   Fuller, his chief of staff, would not confirm speculation thatBush himself had proposed the assignment to Reagan, saying onlythat he and Reagan had worked out the arrangements.   Fuller told reporters on Air Force II after Bush's appearancethat the vice president ``feels very good about'' the way his20-minute address to the world forum came across.   It was Bush's last scheduled public appearance until nextWednesday, when he begins a six-day campaign swing.   He has no public events planned for today, and on Saturday heleaves for a 4{-day fishing trip at a remote, undisclosed locationin Wyoming with Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III, a closefriend and adviser.   Bush on Thursday also gave his first public reaction to thenaming by Dukakis as former rival Sen. Lloyd Bentsen as his runningmate, beyond a cryptic ``that's interesting'' on the day of theannouncement.   He called the selection of Bentsen ``an unusual choice'' buttold reporters aboard Air Force Two he did not think it would hurthim politically, even in his adopted state of Texas. Bentsendefeated Bush in a 1970 Senate race.   Asked if the selection would make him campaign harder for Texas'29 electoral votes, Bush said, ``I don't know. I certainly won'tlighten up.''   ``I plan to spend a lot of time in Texas anyway. I am certainlynot going to take Texas for granted and I will win Texas.''   ``The race is going to be determined, as I said in 1980 and as Isaid in 1984, by the top of the ticket. That's what will determineit in Texas and elsewhere.''</TEXT></DOC>
