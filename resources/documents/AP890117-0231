But you and Uncle Sam differ in your approach to accounting. Itmight surprise many people, but the old sprendthrift usesbookkeeping that is more severely restrictive and harder to live bythan yours.   This is but one of the ways in which, some critics claim, the bigfederal budget deficits may be overstated, at least with respect totheir immediate impact on the strength or weakness of the economy.   It isn't at all an apology for the rich uncle's big debts or areason to continue them. In fact, an unusual spectrum of economistsfrom conservative to liberal agree that regular annual budgetdeficits must be checked.   But, says James Griffin, chief economist of the Aetna InvestmentManagement Group, ``unless we understand how the numbers arederived, it is impossible to draw any reliable meaning from them.''   The big difference between you and your uncle is that you keep acapital budget, spreding payments for durable, big-ticket items suchas your home and automobile over many years. It's the cash flow-debtservice concept.   Sam has no capital budget.   It means that whatever the government buys, however long or shortits useful life might be, it becomes an immediate expense. It'scalled cash-based accounting, and it flies in the face of standardaccounting practices.   Griffin comments that while a cash-based system may have merit,``it is simple to the point of being silly when applied to thefederal government's operations.''   He estimates, for example, that if capital items were consideredin the federal budget, ``we would get better than halfway to a zerobalance.''   For an entity that makes significant capital-type expenditures,he explains, the important point to recognize is that a zero balanceon a cash system is a stringent budget indeed. ``Cash on thebarrelhead for everything!''   Business doesn't operate that way. Homeowners don't attempt to doso. If they did they might be confronted with numbers so horrifyingthey would sell the house and car and rent the least expensiveapartment they could find.   Sensibly, they reason that the house and car are good for a fewyears at a minimum, and that they can space out their payments inaffordable units over that time.   And that brings up another matter that conceivably lessens theimpact of Uncle Sam's deficits. It is inflation, and the decliningvalue of the dollars used to pay off debt.   Just as inflation allows you to repay your mortgage in cheaperdollars _ offset to some degree these days by variable interestrates _ it also allows Uncle Sam to repay his debts with money thatisn't worth as much as it seems.   Says Griffin:   ``With $1.83 trillion of privately held outstanding federal debtsecurities and a 4.2 percent inflation rate in fiscal 1988, thedecline in the real value of outstanding debt offset roughly halfthe officially reported deficit.''   There may be a danger _ most economists today might say a veryreal one _ in playing down budget-deficit dangers, especially inview of the tendency of Uncle Sam to seek excuses for spendingbeyond his means.   But at the other extreme, there may be pitfalls too in failing tounderstand where those big numbers come from, especially by thosefolks who tend to look at government budgets as similar to their own.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Tues, Jan 17</NOTE></DOC>
