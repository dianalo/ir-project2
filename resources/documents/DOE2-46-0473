Coupled equationsfor the quasiparticle energy and chiral gap angle are derived. The resultinggap equation is no longer form invariant under shifts of the effectivequark-quark potential by a constant. Furthermore, under such shifts ofthe potential, the quasiparticle energy no longer shifts by a constant.We show that this apparent shortcoming is connected with the fact thatcolor fluctuations arise in performing calculations using the grand canonicalensemble without prior projection onto color-singlet states. We alsoinvestigate the identification of an effective quasiparticle mass atfinite temperatures via the limit of the real-time single-particle Green'sfunction at low momenta, in order to make clear the connection with thework of previous authors.</TEXT></DOC>
