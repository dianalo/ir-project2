About 20,000 civilians and soldiers earlier celebrated the 68thbirthday of the Chinese Communist Party in the vast and immaculatesquare, which thousands of soldiers captured June 3-4 from studentsand supporters demanding democracy.   The gate reopened to the public today, but those in TiananmenSquare needed the approval of martial law officials.   In the square, thousands of people were sworn in as partymembers. Groups of helmeted soldiers marched by, holding AK-47machine guns in their white-gloved hands.   Hundreds sang a children's song that has been heard frequently inthe weeks since the crackdown: ``Without the Communist Party, therewould be no new China.''   More than 2,200 tourists visited the ornate 17th-century gate,which sits on the square's northern end and is the main entrance tothe former Imperial Palace.   Nearly all the tourists were Chinese, but the evening televisionnews showed a couple identified as Americans.   Chinese visitors paid $2.70 _ two days' wages for many workers _gathered at the gate where revolutionary leader Mao Tse-tungdeclared the founding of the People's Republic of China on Oct. 1,1949.   Plainclothes security men, wearing straw hats and holdingwalkie-talkies, stood along the marble railing from which Mao'sportrait hangs.   Tourists crowded to get an autograph of Gen. Wang Fuyi, one ofthe army commanders who brought troops to quell the student proteststhat the government called ``counterrevolutionary rebellion.''   Other tourists jostled for autographs from Beijing Vice MayorZhang Baifa, who accompanied Wang. Many crowding for autographs saidthey did not know Zhang or Wang and were just following the others.   A woman from the northeastern province of Liaoning who arrived inBeijing two days ago said she did not know what had happened in thecapital, where official reports say about 300 people died in themilitary crackdown.   Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence sources say the deathtoll could be as high as 3,000.   ``Everybody says it is all right now,'' she said.   A woman from eastern Shandong province claimed she didn't evenknow the protests and crackdown had taken place. Her only interestwas in having another traveler take her picture atop the gate.   Vehicles and bicycles were allowed to drive around TiananmenSquare but were not allowed to stop.   Students demanding democracy, press freedom and a cleangovernment demonstrated in the square for seven weeks until themilitary crackdown. Officials say there was no firing inside thesquare itself and that no deaths took place there, but studentwitnesses dispute this.   The Monument to the People's Heroes inside the square, which thestudents used as a podium during their protests, was draped Saturdaywith two long crimson banners proclaiming, ``Long Live the GreatChinese Communist Party'' and ``Firmly Support the Communique of theFourth Central Committee.''   It was at the party Central Committee's fourth session lastweekend that party Secretary General Zhao Ziyang, who sympathizedwith the students, was ousted.</TEXT></DOC>
