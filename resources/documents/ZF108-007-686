 Wordprocessors are sometimes described as analogous to pencils, aparadigm which confuses the evolution of document preparation;pencils' deficiencies were overcome in the 19th century with theinvention of shorthand and typewriters.andP;  World War IIcode-breaking devices also contained some of the roots ofword-processor technology.andP;  As designers try to make computers as'simple as appliances,' appliances themselves are becoming morecomplex.andP;  Major obstacles to the growth of home computing includethe lack of useful applications, the fact that on-line servicesare overpriced, and the fact that on-line banking cannot dispensecash.andP;  Even word processing is not needed by most home users, whocannot justify mastering feature-bloated packages for simplecorrespondence.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Software DesignUser InterfaceProgram Development TechniquesTrendsAnalysisHuman Factors.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>The human-appliance interface Complaints from users may be safely dismissedor diverted by appeals to the newness of the technology--the old &quot;ROM wasn'tbuilt in a day&quot; trick.andP;  Yet the sweet and disarming claim to be a fledglingindustry is surely becoming less and less defensible as we enter the fifthdecade of computing.andP;  You may have joined the fun more recently, but I assureyou that the decade counter started ticking in the late '40s.andP;  (The decadecounter is defined as a real-time clock used in automated news media offices.andO;Every 10 years a signal is generated to initiate a spate of retrospection andprediction.)andM;Self-respecting birds glide and swoop gainfully long before they reach middleage, while we still seem to be squawking unfledged in a nest of regurgitatedworms.andP;  But enough--one of my New Year's resolutions is to eschew thestretching of superficial analogies.andM;For instance, it is time to question whether the &quot;computer-as-appliance&quot;concept is a fruitful one for users, human-interface designers, or(especially) copywriters.andP;  At one extreme you see an advert claiming that acertain word processor is &quot;as easy to use as a pencil!&quot;andP;  It has a picture ofa hand confidently scribbling with a pencil (yes, there is an eraser at theblunt end) and many unversed readers will immediately assume thatwordprocessing skills are in some way analogous to their already-perfectedhandwriting accomplishments.andM;The ensuing enthusiam is &quot;born ...amid exaggerated promises&quot; and declines&quot;under the weight of excessive expectations.andP;  ...&quot; [2]  (In this quote RobertWright is talking about the decline in vogue of general systems theory sincethe 1950s, but the phrasing is just right for my purposes.)andP;  But as you partythe thrust of the advert, it dawns on you that writing with a pencil is oneof the most fiendishly challenging tasks ever mastered by a human.andM;Indeed, until recently (as the pen flies), writing skills were fiercelyguarded by the ruler-priest-scribe axis.andP;  (The imperial power of publicepigraphy is another fascinating aspect: is the chisel mightier than thesword?)andP;  An honest and eye-catching advertisement for a screen-paintingprogram such as QuickDraw or Degas might say &quot;As difficult to use as a paintbrush!&quot;andM;The word processor-pencil analogy, however, confuses the historical evolutionof document preparation.andP;  The deficiencies of the pen and pencil as textgenerators were eventually overcome in the nineteenth century.andP;  Sir IsaacPitman's Stenographic Shorthand (1837) sovled the speed problem, while PhiloRemmington's typewriter (1874) solved the legibility problem (earlier deviceswere not commercially viable).andP;  In passing, it is chilling to note that theengineering know-how needed to perfect and mass-produce the typewriter (andthe sewing machine) was derived from Remmington's large-scale manufacture ofbreech-loading rifles.andP;  There are ironic echoes in the World War IIcryptographic and ballistic applications that helped to spawn the computerindustry.andM;Also note that word processing on the Enigma code-breaking Colossus precededthe numerical, balistic programs of ENIAC.andP;  I mention this because of theprevalent myth that computers are primarily number crunchers that havesomehow been recently doctored to manipulate symbols.andP;  A related irony is thefact that people still question whether UNIX can cope with office work whenits first major application at Bell Labs was on-line document preparation andediting.andM;The complaint that personal computers are insufficiently appliance-like begsseveral questions.andP;  The first point is that the computer is general-purposeto an unprecedented degree.andP;  The devices often hailed as models ofuser-friendliness (drat, I promised never to say that) are relatively simple,single-purpose appliances.andP;  Yet in relation to the functions offered, mostdomestic appliances are really quite complex.andM;The oft-repeated snide remark that you don't need a manual to use atelephone, for example, is just plain false.andP;  Of course, you can dab thebuttons and twirl the dials with little prior training, but to placemeaningful calls you reach for the fattest books on your shelf, those verbosedirectories.andP;  Before I reach the alphabetic listings, Volume I of mywhite-page directory has 59 pages of general information, well formatted tobe sure, but quite dense and intimidating when I need to locate someinfrequently needed service.andM;Furthermore, two of my four telephones have number storage and recallmechanisms.andP;  Need I mention that they require distinct button-pushingsequences to weave their magic?andP;  I had programmed them some time ago to thepoint that I no longer knew the numbers of my most frequently contactedclients and friends.andP;  Normally this is the whole point of the exercise andpresents no problem, but occasionally, when asked for someone's number, Ifind myself unhelpfully saying &quot;You can get Bill on #6.&quot;andP;  And when MadameBell recently ordained that the digit 1 be prefixed to all calls outside thelocal 415 area code, I found myself hunting forthe ancient scrolls that toldme how to reset my dialing macros.andM;Another relevant factor in the computer-appliance debate is the pardox thatas we strive to make computers as &quot;simple as appliances,&quot; the appliancemakers seem to be moving in the opposite direction.andP;  Daily, it seems, ourappliances are sporting more dials, knobs, levers, and embedded programmablechoices to meet our supposed love of gadgetry.andP;  The ideal audio amplifier,consisting of a short piece of wire with gain, an on-off switch, and volumecontrol, just would not fly in today's market.andP;  The interactions between thenew remote-controlled TVs (with digital on-screen help), the cable company'sdecoding box, the VCR (also remotely controlled), and the hi-fi sound system(yes, remotely controlled) provide a hilarious example of current trends.andP;  Ifthe urge to preprogram the recording of four future shows is strong enough,however, a user will manage to wade through the handbook and achieve thisgoal ...andP;  and even gain some self-esteem in beating the odds.andM;The moral is that the user's perception of difficulty is bound up with theperceived rewards.andP;  Is this at the root of the languishing home-computermarket?andP;  Not only are many installed PCs underused or completely neglected,but their penetration (compared with say the fax, VCR, or dedicated gamemachine) is far below expectations.andM;Reliable statistics (another oxymoron?) are elusive, but some surveys stillindicate that over 50% of home computers gather dust through want ofworthwhile applications.andP;  There is no shortage of financial, educational, andentertainment software, much of it at the attractive price of epsilon orless.andP;  Yet most PC owners apparently see no real cost-effectiveness orworthwhile return on their effort in automating their personal clericalchores.andM;Were their expections, based on misguided promises of appliance-likesimplicity, quickly dashed by the complexities of the user interface?andP;  Inthis context, the latter phrase subsumes all the inconveniences of diskettehandling, file names and directory hierarchies, printer consumables andcables, as well as the endless variations in screen displays and menuselection.andP;  There is no point in claiming that all these obstacles are easilymastered with a little practice.andP;  Surveys indicate that the user has triedand given up.andP;  It seems that the learning curve for any given application isnot commensurate with the perceived rewards.andP;  Some of the jobs are clearlynot a practical as first touted--recipe databases and calorie-counting springto mind.andM;Checkbooks are balanced once a month, if at all.andP;  One-line data services areoverpriced while on-line banking has not yet solved the cash-dispensingproblem.andP;  (Bank note production always keeps ahead of domestically availableprinting technology!)andP;  The advent of low-cost electronic mail may help swingthe balance.andP;  My own experience may be atypical, though.andP;  I find myselfsending MCI messages, then faxing to tell my recipients to check their INBOX,then phoning them to see if the fax was received.andM;We seem to be left with word processing.andP;  Yet again, we need to ask how manyletters and memos a home user must generate to justify mastering one of thosewidely advertised, feature-bloated but easy-as-a-pencil packages.andP;  Some,having spent $400 on the choicest word processor, are reduced to buying oneof those $49.95 keyboard-to-printer typewriter-simulation packages to avoidthat bother with floppies, file names, and directories.andM;Perhaps the way ahead for homebound data processing is dedicatedcomputer-based applicances rather than general-purpose appliance-basedcomputers.andP;  Each user-appliance interface can be appropriately tailored.andM;My reference to trash-can icons in the August 1989 Bit by Bit columntriggered an interesting communication from Guy L. Steele, coauthor withSamuel P. Harbison of the excellent C: A Reference Guide (Englewood Cliffs,N.J.: Prentice Hall, 1987) and co-compiler of The Hacker's Dictionary (NewYork, N.Y.: Harper andamp; Row, 1983).andP;  Steele asks: &quot;Have you noticed howdifficult it can be too dispose of a real-life trash can?andP;  Just setting itout empty by the curb on trash collection day doesn't work, no matter howbattered it is.andP;  even attaching a note does not always work.andP;  A trash can isa reserved word in the sanitation business.andP;  You must really crush it or tearit to pieces so it no longer looks like a trash can.&quot;andM;Perhaps the answer is nested dust-bins.andP;  All but the outer can is consideredrubbish--hence the phrase, garbage-in, garbage-out.andP;  And did you know thatthe French have a lovely word for trash can?andP;  La poubelle, named for thePrefet de la Seine who initiated garbage collection via containers on Jan.andO;15, 1884.andP;  I presume his descendents now have mixed feelings about thishonor.andM;The real trash can has other properties not found in the usual iconicmanifestation: you can tip out real refuse and retrieve your castoffs atrandom.andP;  A recent incident when some World Series tickets were accidentlydiscarded proved that you can rush down to the dumping ground and, with luck,still recover your property.andP;  Is there an iconic dump somewhere holding allour deletions?andM;I still like my idea of jazzing up the whole process of erasing files.andP;  Boxeswith inscribed file names flit across the screen and you try to zap thetarget with your joystick blaster.andP;  You lose points for hitting COMMAND.COM.andM;Stan Kelly-Bootle graduated from Cambridge University, U.K., where he earnedthe world's first postgraduate diploma in computer science.andP;  Kelly-Bootle isthe author of The Devil's DP Dictionary and eight other books.andP;  Judy Collinssings his &quot;Liverpool Lullaby&quot; on her LP In My Life.andP;  He can be reached bywriting to COMPUTER LANGUAGE, 500 Howard St., San Francisco, Calif.andP;  94105.andM;ReferencesandM;[1] Kelly-Bootle, Stan.andP;  The devil's DP Dictionary, New York: McGraw-Hill,1981.andM;[2] Wright, Robert.andP;  Three Scientists and Their Gods, Looking for Meaning inan Age of Information, New York, N.Y.: Times Books, 1988.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
