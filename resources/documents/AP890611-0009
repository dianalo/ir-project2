Gorbachev's first statevisit to West Germany is overshadowed by tragedy and unrest in theSoviet Union and an accelerating threat worldwide to the socialistideology that guides his leadership.   But the Soviet president's advance men have been deftlydeflecting the distractions, hinting that major initiatives may bein the making during the much-publicized summit.   Gorbachev's four-day visit, which begins Monday, comes with highexpectations on both sides. Each speaks of a new era in relationsand a historic chance for closing the gap between East and West.   Both nations are focusing on the opportunities presented byGorbachev's reforms, relegating to the sidelines the reform-relatedcrises in China, Eastern Europe and among ethnic groups within theSoviet Union.   ``We consider this an extremely important meeting, perhaps themost important one we've had in Europe,'' Gennady I. Gerasimov, theSoviet government spokesman, said in an interview on Friday.   Acknowledging West Germans' enthusiasm for the Kremlin leader andhis reform program, Gerasimov said Gorbachev wanted a close look atWest Germany and would go out and ``press the flesh.''   Asked if Gorbachev planned to respond to President Bush's armscontrol initiative announced May 29 during the NATO summit inBrussels, Gerasimov said: ``There is no ground for a quick reply.''   He said the conventional weapons reduction plan outlined by Bushand endorsed by the Western allies has not been formally presentedto negotiators at superpower talks in Vienna, so an official Kremlinresponse was unlikely.   But he said another Soviet step in the disarmament volley was``possible'' during the summit that opens Monday.   Another member of the Soviet advance delegation, politicalobserver Lev A. Bezymensky of the magazine New Times, told reportersFriday that ``we should let ourselves be surprised'' by what takesplace during the summit.   Hans Klein, a West German government spokesman, sees the visit asa chance to reach a goal of ``peace with ever fewer weapons.''Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher predicted ``a milestone inGerman-Soviet relations.''   The atmosphere of hope, however, has been tainted by numerousdomestic troubles likely to continue boiling while the Soviet leaderis abroad.   Ethnic unrest in the Central Asian republic of Uzbekistanreportedly prompted some last-minute schedule changes to allowGorbachev to stay in close contact with the Kremlin throughout hisvisit.   The Congress of People's Deputies finally ended its stormyinaugural session Friday. The lawmakers' struggle to redefine thenation's course for democracy and their sharp criticism of theCommunist Party amazed the Soviet people, who watched on television,and preoccupied the Kremlin leadership.   Soviets are in mourning over the hundreds of deaths resultingfrom a train disaster in the Ural Mountains June 3, and the advancedelegation indicated Gorbachev would not be attending a gala concertin Bonn on Wednesday so as to maintain an appropriately somberatmosphere. But the hosts' eagerness to give the summit the highestprofile appears to have won out.   ``The Germans have done a very clever thing,'' said Yuri A.Gremitskikh, another senior Soviet Foreign Ministry official in Bonnto prepare the summit. ``They have now made it a concert to benefitthe victims of the train tragedy, so we will have to reconsider.''   Both sides have pinned high hopes on the visit and its potentialto maintain good momentum in improving relations between East andWest.   West Germans have embraced Gorbachev's call for ``a commonEuropean home,'' an aim they see as an opportunity to let thebarriers fall between East and West and perhaps lead to an eventualreunification of Germany.   The conservative Bonn daily newspaper Die Welt reported two weeksago that the West German government ``expects that Gorbachev willstress the German right of self-determination in some form oranother when he visits West Germany.'' That would soften theKremlin's traditional view that reunification could take place onlyunder a socialist leadership.   Soviet officials have indicated such a gesture is possible, butthey have given no clues as to what Gorbachev might say on thatsubject, or in response to persistent questions about the BerlinWall erected by East Germany in 1961.   Eduard Shevardnadze, the Soviet foreign minister, visited Berlinon Friday for talks with East German leader Erich Honecker.   Gerasimov described his visit with Honecker as a matter ofprotocol prior to the state visit to West Germany, but the ministerdeclined to specify what matters would be discussed at the Gorbachevsummit.   The visit is likely to provide a boost to the standing of WestGerman Chancellor Helmut Kohl.   Gorbachev was rated as the most popular foreign statesman ever ina poll released a week ago by the weekly magazine Der Spiegel,outdistancing even John F. Kennedy, and the Gorbachev visit may helpKohl and his Christian Democratic party in next week's EuropeanParliament elections.   Heinrich Vogel, director of the federal Institute for Eastern andInternational Studies in Cologne and a specialist in Soviet affairs,predicted that the summit would focus on atmosphere rather thansubstance, mostly because of the sensitive stage in which theKremlin leader finds himself.   Vogel said problems with socialism as an ideology beganescalating with the Polish Solidarity movement in 1980 and latelyhave ``been accelerating at an unbelievable pace, a pace that isreally staggering and frightening.''</TEXT></DOC>
