Ina short term perspective the Swedish natural gas market is estimatedto 2.5 billion m3. It is reasonable that only a certain part of the nuclearelectric power production will be replaced by an electric power productionbased on natural gas. With this assumption the Swedish natural gas marketin the beginning of the next century will be of the order of 5-7 billionm3 per year. Potential suppliers of natural gas are Norway, the SovietUnion via Finland, and Denmark. 2 figs., 4 tables.</TEXT></DOC>
