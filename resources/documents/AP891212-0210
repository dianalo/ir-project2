The plan would place a nominal value of $240 on a share ofcommon stock, the Chicago Tribune reported, quoting unidentifiedsources. It also contemplates UAL employees owning about two-thirdsof the stock after a buyout, and public stockholders aboutone-third, the Tribune said.   Management officials made buyout proposals last week to UnitedAirlines' pilots' and flight attendants' unions, the paper said.   While the UAL board of directors is scheduled to meet Wednesday,the sources said management is not expected to present any buyoutproposal then.   In October, a $6.75 billion, or $300 a share, buyout attemptfailed for lack of financing.   That proposal was undercut by the Machinists' union, whichopposes a highly leveraged buyout of the airline.   A Machinists' source told the Tribune that if speculation abouta $240 a share offer is true, ``that proposal would be rejected byus as too high.''   The pilots' union hasn't acknowledged receiving the rumoredproposal. The flight attendants said they had gotten it, butdeclined comment until it was more thoroughly studied.   The Tribune said its sources believed the pilots feel theproposal falls short of some of their demands, including having avoice in running the company.   The sources said management increased somewhat the contractconcessions it is seeking from the flight attendants in return fortheir participation in an employee stock ownership plan.</TEXT></DOC>
