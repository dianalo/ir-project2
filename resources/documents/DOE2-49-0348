Concernswere specifically expressed about the handling and burning of refuse-derivedfuel (RDF), asbestos insulation, coal dust, fly ash, hot working environments,polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) present in grounding transformers, andon site chemical usage and storage. RDF was composed primarily of theshredded combustible part of municipal solid waste. A survey of the facilityindicated that potential hazards did exist from noise, heat, asbestos,coal dust, and crystalline silica. The only documented case of over exposurewas to coal dust in the coal yard. Metal exposure was very low or nondetectable.The author concludes that hazards existed due to heat levels, noise,potential asbestos exposure, and elevated coal dust and silica exposures.The author makes recommendations.</TEXT></DOC>
