The new methodis identified as follows: EQL-0589-072, ``Determination of Lead Concentrationin Ambient Particulate Matter by Energy Dispersive X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrometry(NEA, Inc.)''. The applicant's request for an equivalent method determination for theabove method was received on January 23, 1989. Additional requested informationpertinent to the original submittal was received on March 10, 1989. This method has been tested by the applicant, Nuclear Environmental Analysis,Inc., in accordance with the test procedures prescribed in 40 CFR Part53. After reviewing the results of these tests and other information submittedby the applicant, EPA has determined, in accordance with Part 53, thatthis method should be designated as an equivalent method. The informationsubmitted by the applicant will be kept on file at EPA's Atmospheric Researchand Exposure Assessment Laboratory, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina,and will be available for inspection to the extent consistent with 40 CFRPart 2 (EPA's regulations implementing the Freedom of Information Act).This method uses the sampling procedure specified in the reference methodfor the determination of lead in suspended particulate matter collectedfrom ambient air (43 FR 46258). The lead content of the sample is analyzedby energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometry using a radioactive-sourceexcited system. The NEA method uses an EGandamp;G Ortec TEFA III system.Technical questions concerning the method should be directed to NuclearEnvironmental Analysis, Inc., 10950 SW. 5th Street, Suite 260, Beaverton,Oregon 97005. As a designated equivalent method, this method is acceptable for use bystates and other control agencies under requirements of 40 CFR Part 58,Ambient Air Quality Surveillance. For such purposes the method must beused in strict accordance with the procedures and specifications providedin the method description. States or other agencies wishing to use energy-dispersiveX-ray fluorescence spectrometric methods that employ procedures and specificationssignificantly different from those in this method must seek specific approvalfor their particular method under the provisions of andSection; 2.8 of AppendixC to 40 CFR Part 58 (Modification of Methods by Users) or may seek designationof such methods as equivalent methods under the provisions of 40 CFR Part53. Additional informtion concerning this action may be obtained from FrankF. McElroy, Quality Assurance Division (MD-77), Atmospheric Research andExposure Assessment Laboratory, U. S. Environmental Protection Agency,Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711, (919) 541-2622. <ITAG tagnum="6">Erich W.
