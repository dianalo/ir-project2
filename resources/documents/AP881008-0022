(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Aides to Jim and Tammy Bakker say thecouple will continue to try to regain control of PTL, but they'llhave to take aim at the television mininstry from a slightlygreater distance.   Volunteers on Friday moved furniture into the new headquartersof Jim and Tammy Ministries, a house on a 300-acre Pineville estateowned by Dexter Yager, a regional Amway products distributor.   The couple had been operating out of a storefront in a shoppingcenter five miles to the south in Fort Mill, S.C., home of PTL'sHeritage USA Christian theme park, but that office was leased tosomeone else, Bakker spokesman Hal Sweigart said.   PTL bankruptcy trust M.C. ``Red'' Benton announced earlier thisweek that he had accepted a $115 million offer for PTL's assetsfrom Toronto businessman Stephen Mernick, but aides to the Bakkerssay they haven't given up hope of regaining control of the ministrythey founded. Mernick's bid awaits a judge's approval.   ``We consider the new office an interim step on the way back toHeritage USA,'' said Lin Robertson, a volunteer at Jim and TammyMinistries.   Bakker's $172 million offer to buy back PTL last month fellthrough when he could not prove he had financial backing.   Bakker resigned from PTL in March 1987 after admitting a sexualencounter with church secretary Jessica Hahn seven years earlier.Three months after Bakker made his admission, the ministry filedfor bankruptcy reorganization.</TEXT><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Mikhail Baryshnikov next year will make hisstage debut in a drama, playing the lead in an adaptation of FranzKafka's existential masterpiece ``Metamorphosis.''

(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A Rhode Island School of Designinstructor says the controversial book ``The Lives of John Lennon''accurately tells the story of his brief affair with Yoko Ono.   The unauthorized biography by Albert Goldman describes theformer Beatle as an anorexic bisexual addled by drugs. It has beensharply criticized by Lennon's widow and associates, with Onocalling it ``totally fiction.''   But Al Wunderlich, associate professor of painting at RISD, saidGoldman dealt truthfully with his small part in the story.   ``He was quite thorough and professional when he interviewedme,'' Wunderlich said. ``He impressed me by knowing a lot of thedetails already _ it seemed like ancient history to me.''   Wunderlich was a friend of Ono's second husband, Tony Cox, andjoined Cox and Ono in Japan for some avant-garde art happenings.

A recipe for the meatloaf is among 200 that Orr will include inthe ``First Gentleman's Cookbook'' he is writing. Profits from thebook, which is scheduled to appear in February, will be used toredecorate the Governor's Mansion, he said Friday.
