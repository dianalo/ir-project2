The effort was aimed at weakening legislation demanded byPresident Bush and pushed through several committees by liberalDemocrats to make Sandamp;L owners put $6.4 billion more of their ownmoney at risk as a price for the $143 billion bailout, the biggestin the nation's history.   Of 10 proposals to reduce the amount of new capital that Sandamp;Lswould have to raise, an amendment by Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill.,appeared headed toward becoming the vehicle for opposing Bush'splan when the bill reaches the House floor next week.   ``Of the amendments that deal with that issue, I think it is themost precise,'' said Rep. Charles Pashayan Jr., R-Calif., a memberof the House Rules Committee.   The committee spent most of Tuesday deciding which of 109offered amendments will be allowed to be taken up when the fullHouse debates and votes on the 290-page bill. Another meeting wasscheduled for Wednesday.   In addition to the capital standards, the rules panel wasexpected to approve floor consideration of an amendment by the Waysand Means Committee to add the $50 billion immediate taxpayer shareof the bailout's cost to the federal budget deficit for the nextthree years.   Bush has proposed financing the government share of the bailoutthrough long-term capital bonds that would add only $4.5 billion ininterest costs to the deficit in fiscal 1989, 1990 and 1991. Andadministration officials have vowed to recommend that he veto anymeasure that tampers with the financing.   Republicans also were demanding floor votes on amendments toundo a pair of administration-opposed housing measures added toBush's package by the House Banking Committee.   One would make Sandamp;Ls subsidize low-income home mortgages by $75million to $150 million a year. The other would give poor familiesfirst crack at buying some of the tens of billions of dollars inresidential property that has fallen into the government's hands asthe result of defaults on loans by insolvent thrift institutions.   Both of the housing measures as well as making the bailout'scosts part of the federal deficit were rejected by the Senate,which passed its version of the bill in April.   Other amendments appeared headed for floor votes in the Houseincluded putting a cap on government borrowing for the bailout andrestoring proposed $1 million-a-day civil penalites for bank fraudand other Sandamp;L crimes.   Bush had demanded the $1 million civil penalties to discouragefraud and embezzlement, which has been blamed by governmentofficials for more than half of the estimated $100 billion in Sandamp;Llosses over the past five years.   However, in response to an intense lobbying effort by theAmerican Bankers Association and other trade groups, the HouseJudiciary Committee two weeks ago amended the bill to allow civildamages of only twice what the government has lost as a result ofthe wrongdoing.   Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., chairman of the financialinstitutions subcommittee of the House Banking Committee,complained that bankers and other financial officers will be ableto escape civil fines for fraud if examiners catch them at itbefore the losses become severe.   ``How can we favor almost meaningless penalties for financialcrooks?'' Annunzio said, seeking a floor vote on an amendment torestore Bush's proposal.   But the biggest fight was over the capital requirements. And onthat issue, Annunzio was at the forefront with several HouseRepublicans in endorsing Hyde's amendment to weaken Bush's plan.   Hyde's proposal would make the government go through lengthyjudicial hearings before requiring newcash infusions from 241 Sandamp;Lsgranted so-called ``supervisory good will'' exemptions from capitalstandards in the early 1980s.   The exemptions, some extending for as long as up to 40 years,were granted to then-healthy Sandamp;Ls for taking over failing thriftsat the government's request. The purpose was to preserve thesolvency of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., whichguarantees depositors against losses up to $100,000 each.   ``This policy saved the American taxpayers over $13 billion atthe time,'' said Hyde. He added that ``virtually everyone agreesthat these mergers never would have taken place but for the factthat good will was part of the bargain. Due process and fundamentalfairness are concepts that cannot be tossed aside simply because ofthe latest crisis.''   However, supporters of Bush's plan to make Sandamp;L owners put uptheir own money as a ``cushion'' between possible future losses andthe government's deposit insurance funds, said good will has nocash value.   ``You cannot count air has hard cash and good will is justair,'' said Rep. Henry Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the HouseBanking Committee.</TEXT></DOC>
