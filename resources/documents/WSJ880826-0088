Several funds have reopened to new investors since October's stock market crash. They include stellar performers, such as the Lindner Fund and the Lindner Dividend Fund, as well as the Putnam High Yield Fund, Putnam Option Income Fund and the Keystone Custodian Series B-4 Fund. Even Vanguard Group's mammoth $5.69 billion Windsor Fund has eased its ban on fresh cash.    The funds had closed because heavy cash inflows made them unmanageable: Before last October, money was coming in so fast that some funds couldn't invest it quickly enough.    Now, however, lower stock prices -- along with slack sales -- have led the funds to rethink their strategies.    A few years back, when the Lindner funds shut out new investors, officials said there weren't enough cheaply priced stocks. But after the crash, &quot;bargains started coming out of the woodwork,&quot; says Eric Ryback, a Lindner vice president.    The changed sales picture has played a part, too. &quot;Not only do (the funds) not have money coming in, but . . . they have a few more redemptions than normal,&quot; says Walter Rouleau, president of Growth Fund Guide, a Rapid City, S.D., newsletter. &quot;They're trying to replace that.&quot;    About 17 mutual funds remain closed to new investors, down from a peak of about two dozen at the end of 1986. And fund specialists say the number will shrink further. &quot;As long as the market stays down, more will open up,&quot; says Joseph Mansueto, president of Morningstar Inc., a Chicago-based financial-publications company.    A few closed funds say they have no plans to reopen. Officials at the $727 million Sequoia Fund, which has been closed since 1982, say they're still holding too much cash to consider changing course.    &quot;If we're only 50% in stocks, what's the point of trying to get more cash?&quot; asks Richard Cunniff, fund co-manager. Though Mr. Cunniff says there are more stocks &quot;within striking distance&quot; of being bought by Sequoia now than several years ago, he says: &quot;We feel that our clients are our responsibility -- not our non-clients.&quot;    Still, officials of many other funds that shut off new money say it's time again to attract more investors. Keystone Custodian Funds, which closed its B-4 Fund in April 1986, says it did so because the overflow of cash coming in threatened its ability to properly research fixed-income securities. Says Thomas Drumm, senior vice president: &quot;In deference to shareholders, we wanted to maintain a quality shop and slow things down a little bit.&quot; Now, however, he says the sluggish sales environment has changed all that.    At Lindner Management Corp., officials say investors have put more than $10 million into the $404 million Lindner Fund since it reopened in mid-April. Most of that has come from new investors, officials add.    Lindner officials say the response has been, in part, an emotional reaction on the part of investors. &quot;People are really bothered by something they can't have,&quot; Mr. Ryback says. &quot;Now that it's open, they're rushing in.&quot;    The Windsor Fund in March opened its doors -- but only a crack. The fund had shut out both new and existing investors in May 1985 amid heavy inflows that helped boost the fund's cash holding to 28%. Worried about derailing its investment strategy, the fund closed to all but those holders in specific retirement plans, such as individual retirement accounts. Until next March, existing Windsor holders are allowed to put up to $10,000 into the fund -- though so far, a Vanguard spokesman says, &quot;not much money has come in.&quot; After that period, the fund again will be closed to all but retirement-plan holders.    Officials of Putnam Financial Services, which reopened its High Yield and Option Income funds to new investors in recent months, declined to give their reasons for doing so.    Some funds that have reopened aren't likely to close again anytime soon. Lindner officials say that even if fund managers find bargains in the market increasingly scarce, they will try to avoid closing the fund. &quot;No investor wants a fund to open and then close six months later -- and we'll be forced to weigh that,&quot; Mr. Ryback says. As for now, the fund is nearly fully invested, he says, adding: &quot;We spend everything we get in.&quot;    ---   CHANGE OF PACE: The No-Load Mutual Fund Association, a group representing more than 100 direct-marketed mutual funds, is looking for a new executive director.    Laura Berger, who had held that position for eight years, left earlier this month after being told that the association wanted to move in a different direction. Nicholas Kaiser, executive vice president, says, &quot;We don't want to be as much a private club for no-load funds, but an educational association to let people know about the advantages of investing in mutual funds.&quot; As part of the drive, the association soon will propose to its members that it change the name to the Mutual Fund Education Alliance.    Ms. Berger, who says she had a &quot;close working relationship&quot; with the association's biggest members, says she expects to remain within the industry, possibly as a consultant.    ---                          Reopened Doors   The following have recently allowed investors to buy into the funds.
