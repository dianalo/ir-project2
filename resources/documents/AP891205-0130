Israeli jets staged their second raid into Lebanon in the past12 days in an attempt to forestall further infiltrations coincidingwith the uprising's second anniversary on Friday. Lebanese policesaid seven people were wounded.   In the occupied Gaza Strip, a Palestinian teen-ager was killedand 20 Palestinians were wounded in stone-throwing clashes withtroops, Arab doctors said.   The death raised to 626 the number of Palestinians killed byIsraeli gunfire during the uprising against Israel's occupation ofthe West Bank and Gaza. Forty-three Israelis have died since the``intefadeh,'' as the revolt is called, began on Dec. 8, 1987.   The clash in the Negev desert occurred before dawn when anIsraeli force encountered the five guerrillas and gave chase. Thesoldiers killed all the guerrillas in the hilly area of Mount Harifand suffered no casualties themselves, the army said.   Maj. Gen. Matan Vilnai, head of the army's southern command,said the infiltration was apparently linked to the uprisinganniversary.   ``We can assume there is a link between these things. ... Thereis no doubt that organizations which we confront would try to carryout such an attack,'' he said on armed forces radio.   The guerrillas carried Soviet-designed Kalashnikov assaultrifles, 51 hand grenades, a pistol with magazines, binoculars andwire cutters, and were on their way to a ``spectacular attack'' inIsrael, the army said.   Vilnai said the guerrillas' equipment ``shows they simply meantto kill. Not to argue too much, not to carry out a hostage-takingoperation, but a killing operation.''   ``They carried no documents, and as a result we cannot know towhat group they belonged,'' he added.   It was the first infiltration in nine months from Egypt, theonly Arab country to have a peace treaty with Israel. The lastoccurred March 15, 1989, when two guerrillas from a fundamentalistMoslem group were captured near the border town of Rafah.   There have been at least 50 infiltrations this year fromLebanon. Israel staged its 17th raid of the year on guerrilla basesthere Tuesday.   Four fighters struck the base of terrorist mastermind AbuNidal's Fatah Revolutionary Council in the Majdalioun Valley, eastof Sidon, a Lebanese police spokesman said. Seven people werereported wounded.   The Israeli army said all aircraft returned safely.   On Nov. 25, Israeli jets attacked bases of the Popular Front forthe Liberation of Palestine-General Command in Lebanon.   In the occupied Gaza Strip, soldiers opened fire to dispersePalestinian stone-throwers, killing a 17-year-old and wounding 20other demonstrators, hospital officials said. They said Nasseral-Kejek was fatally wounded in the chest.   The army said Tuesday that all schools in Gaza will be closedstarting Wednesday ``until further notice,'' apparently to preventriots linked to the uprising anniversary.   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, in a speech in Tel Aviv devotedto the anniversary, said that ``politically, the Palestinians thisyear ... are in a much weaker situation than they were a year ago.''   Rabin said ``stone-throwing in the Middle East'' was low on theinternational agenda but noted it was bothering Israel, since 85percent of violent incidents in the territories werestone-throwings.   However, Rabin said, ``they cannot move the bulk of Palestiniansto demonstrations, no doubt violent demonstrations. All theattempts at civil disobedience have failed completely.''   The Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the OccupiedTerritories said Tuesday that 132 children under the age of 17 havebeen shot and killed in the uprising, including 37 under the age of13.   It said the number of casualties among children is increasing.   Rabin and Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir were briefed Tuesday byassistant U.S. Secretary of State John Kelly on last weekend'ssummit between President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S.Gorbachev.   ``The situation in the region does not depend on the decision ofworld powers, even superpowers,'' Shamir said afterward. ``Thesituation depends on us and our neighbors, and the solution will befound in agreement between Israel and its neighbors. We should notexpect salvation from the superpowers.''</TEXT></DOC>
