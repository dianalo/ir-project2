Mr. Maxwell, who died last month, took skillful advantageof those strict laws to intimidate the press and hisemployees and prevent disclosures about the problems at hisnewspapers and other properties. Most recently, a Britishlawyer for beneficiaries of a Maxwell-company pension fundsaid Mr. Maxwell effectively silenced employees bythreatening to sue them when they raised questions about hisunauthorized loans or transfers of fund money to privateMaxwell interests.</LP><TEXT>   It is unlikely that would have happened in the U.S., wherejournalists and others enjoy strong protections from theFirst Amendment's free press and free speech clauses.Britain's unwritten constitution contains no Bill of Rightsand libel laws are skewed in favor of plaintiffs. The climatein Britain is so favorable for people who file libel suits,that increasingly foreigners -- including Americans -- filelibel suits in Britain.   &quot;Maxwell was an excellent example of how ill-served thepublic can be by the law of libel,&quot; says David Hooper, aLondon solicitor who has represented several defendantsagainst libel suits brought by Mr. Maxwell. &quot;The result wasthat editors tended to disallow stories which were criticalof Maxwell and investigative stories tended to be discouragedbecause of the libel bill which would be attached to them.&quot;   Some British lawyers have campaigned for almost twodecades to get Parliament to adopt free-speech guaranteessimilar to U.S. constitutional provisions. They say norevisions are likely until the Labor Party regains control ofParliament, but the disclosures about Mr. Maxwell couldbolster the cause of lawyers lobbying for a change.   In a similar vein, some people argue that if Britain'saccounting rules and regulators were as tough as those in theU.S., the problems in the Maxwell empire might have come tolight more quickly.   Under British libel law, plaintiffs must prove that anewspaper has made a defamatory accusation, which isfrequently easy. Then, the burden in the case shifts to thedefendant. The newspaper or person accused of libel mustprove that the allegation is substantially true. Provingtruth in such cases can be extremely difficult if thedefendant must protect confidential sources or the plaintiffis withholding information, says Geoffrey Robertson, a Londonbarrister. The task is especially complicated becauseplaintiffs and third parties knowledgeable about the eventsinvolved are not required by law to provide information tothe defendant's lawyers before trial, he adds.   &quot;Unlike the U.S. the fact that the journalist hascarefully researched the story or relied upon reputablepreviously published material is not capable of being adefense,&quot; Mr. Hooper says.   U.S. libel law, virtually the reverse of British law,makes it easier for newspapers to defend themselves.According to legal standards that have grown out of the U.S.Supreme Court's landmark ruling in New York Times Co. vs.Sullivan in 1964, it is up to a plaintiff to prove that anaccusation is false. In addition, U.S. law provides forin-depth pretrial fact-finding, which enables defense lawyersto interview plaintiffs and others.   In Britain, impending disclosures are often preventedbecause it is fairly easy for companies to persuade judges tosuppress the airing of business matters until a trial can beheld -- sometimes years away. Judges issue those rulingsunder the breach of confidence doctrine, once used to protecttrade secrets but now used to suppress information sharedbetween people with confidential relationships, such as anemployment contracts.   Media defendants try to defeat the claim by arguing thatthe information is out of date, no longer confidential or inthe public interest, says Mr. Robertson, whose clientsinclude Dow Jones andamp; Co., publisher of The Wall StreetJournal.   In the U.S., judges almost never suppress newspaperstories. Sixty years ago the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that aprior restraint will be granted only to guard against suchthings as an imminent threat to national security.   Mr. Hooper adds that libel suits in Britain can also beprohibitively expensive to defend because &quot;there arevirtually no summary procedures,&quot; which in U.S. courts allowjudges to grant motions for dismissal at an early stage inthe case.   &quot;The situation in Britain is testimony to the positiveside of the First Amendment -- the kind of openness itfosters,&quot; says Rodney Smolla, a professor who teaches libellaw at the College of William and Mary, Marshall-Wythe Schoolof Law. &quot;There is no reason why British judges couldn'tdevelop laws like our First Amendment. . . . But the press isless respected there.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
