(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Five Carmelite nuns who have spentfive months barricaded inside their cloister, protesting what theycall the liberalization of their order, said they would defy theireviction Friday by the Vatican.   Two of the women who had taken temporary vows which expiredduring the protest were told they must vacate the Monastery of theMost Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel, the Paterson RomanCatholic Diocese announced.   The diocese added that the two were no longer considered membersof the religious order.   Two others were told they should seek residence in a differentconvent, and the fifth, a 71-year-old nun who suffers from heartproblems, would be allowed to stay in the convent, said Tim Manning,a spokesman for Paterson Bishop Frank Rodimer.   Manning said he did not know if the five nuns would be forciblyremoved if they refused to leave. ``I think perhaps that maybe a bitmore time needs to elapse before those kind of decisions are made,''he said.   The nuns challenged the validity of the ruling Friday and saidthey would continue their protest, said a spokeswoman for the group.   ``Nothing came here with a Vatican seal on it,'' said thespokeswoman, Betty Sutton. ``It's the Bishop's final trick to getthem out.''   Five of the cloister's 13 nuns locked themselves in the infirmaryof their aged white-walled priory on Oct. 4 to protest theintroduction of such things as television and sweets into theirretreat.   The nuns, saying they wanted the monastery returned to theCarmelites' traditionally austere lifestyle, drew internationalattention. Rodimer called the protest ``attempted anarchy.''   The rebel nuns had said they had feared they would be evicted forprotesting the changes, which were initiated by their mothersuperior, prioress Theresa Hewitt.   ``Despite the difficult situation created by some of thereligious, the fundamental principles of religious life were firmlyretained with prudence and charity,'' read the ruling from theCongregation for the Religious, the arm of the Vatican that overseesreligious communities.   Mother Hewitt called the lock-in a ``scandal'' when the nuns tookover the infirmary and criticized the unruly members of her flockfor disrupting the cloistered lifestyle at the Carmel.   The former Sister John was one of two nuns whose vows expiredduring the protest, Manning said. She is now known as NicolePrescott and the other nun, the former Sister Bernadette, is nowknown as Lynn Williams, he said.   The other nuns were identified as Sister Philomena, who suffersfrom heart problems, and Sister Teresita Romano and Sister MariaErcalano.</TEXT></DOC>
