It requires a near-termfreeze at 1986 levels of production and consumption (defined as productionplus imports minus exports) of CFC-11, -12,  -113, -114, and -115 basedon their relative ozone depletion weights, followed by a phased reductionto 80 percent and 50 percent of 1986 levels beginning in mid-1993 and mid-1998,respectively. It also limits production and consumption of Halon 1211,1301, and 2402 to 1986 levels beginning as early as 1992. Under specifiedcircumstances, limited increases in production (but not consumption) abovethese levels would be permitted. Promulgation of this rule is authorized by section 157(b) of the CleanAir Act and constitutes the United States' implementation of the ``MontrealProtocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer'' (Montreal Protocol),which the United States ratified on April 21, 1988. The final rule's controlmeasures will take effect when the Protocol enters into force, which couldoccur as early as January 1, 1989. The rule implements the Protocol's requirements to control production andconsumption of the CFCs and halons specified above by allocating productionand consumption allowances to firms that produced and imported these chemicalsin 1986, based on their 1986 levels of these activities. By directly restrictingthe supply of the regulated chemicals, the United States will meet itsobligations under the Montreal Protocol by means of a straightforward,economically efficient, and easily administered regulatory program. In a separate notice appearing elsewhere in today's <T4>Federal Register</T4>, EPA is seeking public comment on an advancenotice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) which discusses supplementing thisfinal rule with a regulatory fee and/or engineering controls or bans onspecific uses of CFCs and halons or replacing allocated quotas with anauction system. Ideally, market based systems are preferable. An auction, in particular,would insure compliance with the Protocol, and would shift some windfallsfrom the producers to the United States Treasury. EPA is not adopting anauction of production and consumption allowances at this time due to remaininglegal and economic concerns. After reviewing the public comment, the Agencywill decide whether to propose a rule supplementing the allocated quotasystem or shifting to an auction approach, and depending on its decision,would issue a notice of proposed rulemaking containing a detailed descriptionof any proposed modification. The ANPRM also discusses scientific information now available in summaryform that could not be considered in this rulemaking but which suggeststhat the risks of ozone depletion may be greater than previously anticipated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>This final rule will take effect upon entry intoforce of the Montreal Protocol.

Background </ITAG>Stratospheric ozone shields the earth's surface from dangerous ultraviolet(UV-B) radiation. In response to growing scientific evidence, a nationaland international consensus has developed that unabated use of CFCs andhalons will result in depletion of stratospheric ozone. To the extent depletionoccurs, penetration of UV-B radiation will increase, resulting in potentialhealth and environmental harm including increased incidence of certainskin cancers and cataracts, suppression of the immune response system,damage to crops and aquatic organisms, increased formation of ground-levelozone, and increased weathering of outdoor plastics. EPA evaluated the risks of ozone depletion and published its findings in``Assessing the Risks of Trace Gases That Can Modify the Stratosphere''(EPA, 1987), which the Agency's Science Advisory Board (SAB) reviewed andapproved. Based on the Agency's risk assessment work, the Administrator concludedthat an international approach was necessary to effectively safeguard theozone layer. As EPA pointed out in its December 14, 1987 proposal (52 FR47489), theory and available scientific evidence make clear that the problemof stratospheric ozone depletion is global in nature. Over their long atmosphericlifetimes, CFCs and halons become widely dispersed, and the release ofthese chemicals in one country adversely affects the stratosphere above,and therefore the health and welfare of, other countries. The United Statescurrently contributes about 30 percent of worldwide CFC emissions, andits percentage contribution will probably decrease as developing countriesincrease their consumption of CFCs and halons, which are used primarilyin refrigeration, foam-blowing, electronics production, and fire-fighting.As a result, EPA sought to further negotiation of a protocol requiringall nations to curb their use of these chemicals. After a series of international workshops on the cause and effects of ozonedepletion, negotiations for an international control protocol resumed inDecember 1986. Last September the United States and 23 other nations signedthe Montreal Protocol and since then 13 more have signed. The United States,Mexico, Norway, Sweden, Canada, and New Zealand have ratified the Protocol,and several other nations (e.g., Japan, Western European nations) are closeto ratifying the agreement, as well. A. The Montreal Protocol Briefly, the Montreal Protocol requires nations who join to restrict theirproduction and consumption of CFC-11, -12, -113, -114, -115 and Halons1211, 1301, and 2402 in bulk form (referred to as ``controlled substances'').It does not place limits on each of the controlled substances, but insteadgroups the CFCs together (Group I) and the halons together (Group II) andplaces separate limits on the total ozone depletion potential of each groupof controlled substances that can be produced and consumed. As a result,within each group the mix of controlled substances a nation produces andconsumes may change, so long as the total ozone depletion potential ofthe mix does not exceed the specified limits. The Protocol uses the phrase``calculated level'' to refer to this weighting of controlled substancesbased on their relative ozone depletion potential. The Protocol calls for a phased reduction in the production and consumptionof Group I controlled substances and a freeze in the production and consumptionof Group II controlled substances. Specifically, Group I substances arefrozen at 1986 levels beginning on July 1, 1989, assuming the Protocolenters into force on January 1, 1989. (The Protocol will enter into forceon that date if 11 nations or regional economic integration organizationshave ratified the Protocol. Otherwise, the Protocol will take effect 90days after these conditions have been met.) Group I substances are thenreduced to 80 percent and 50 percent of 1986 levels by July 1, 1993, andJuly 1, 1998, respectively. Group II controlled substances are frozen at1986 levels beginning on January 1, 1992, assuming the Protocol entersinto force on January 1, 1989. The Protocol also allows for limited increases in production beyond thereductions described above under prescribed circumstances. In addition,it also bans imports of controlled substances from nations which neitherjoin nor comply with the Protocol one year after the Protocol enters intoforce. (The text of the Protocol is described in detail and printed inits entirety in the December 14, 1987 notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM).)B. December 14, 1987 Proposal In the December 14, 1987 NPRM, the Agency proposed regulations that wouldensure United States' compliance with the Montreal Protocol. EPA statedthat based on its assessment of the available evidence, the Protocol'srequirements are an appropriate response to the potential ozone depletionproblem at this time. The Agency estimated that compliance with the Protocolby most developed and developing nations would reduce ozone depletion bythe year 2075 to 1.3 percent, and stated that given the many variablesand uncertainties involved in predicting ozone depletion far into the future,the Protocol would achieve a reasonable degree of risk reduction. Becauseof the need for an international solution to the ozone depletion problem,EPA added that it would be unwise to risk undermining the agreement bydeviating from its requirements. EPA proposed to implement fully the Protocol's control requirements andimport ban. It proposed to adopt the Protocol's definition of ``controlledsubstances'' and its application of limits on CFCs as a group and halonsas a group on a ozone depletion potential basis (``calculated level'').It also provided for increases in production of controlled substances overthe otherwise applicable limits consistent with the Protocol's allowancesfor such increases. In addition, the Agency proposed that the regulationstake effect when the Protocol enters into force. The December 14 NPRM set forth a number of control strategies for domesticallyimplementing the terms of the Protocol. EPA stated that its preferred controlstrategy was an ``allocated quota'' system. Under this approach, EPA wouldgrant production and consumption ``rights'' or privileges equal to thequantity of production and consumption allowed under the Protocol. Theserights would be apportioned to producers and importers of controlled substancesbased on their 1986 levels of production and imports, and would be frozenand reduced according to the schedule specified in the Protocol. In effect,this proposal would grandfather in past producers and importers at their1986 relative market shares. EPA also proposed that rights be transferable,so that firms could buy and sell production and consumption rights andthus respond to changing market conditions.According to economic theory, an allocated quota system should achieveEPA's regulatory goal at the lowest possible cost to society. By restrictingthe supply of CFCs and halons, this system should cause the price of thesechemicals to be bid up over time by firms seeking to purchase them. Theresulting price increases should, in turn, encourage firms to reduce theiruse of these chemicals and to increase recycling and recovery, and shouldalso create a market incentive for the introduction of chemical substitutes.A declining supply of CFCs and halons would continue to be available, thoughat a higher price, to the highest value users of these chemicals. While EPA proposed the allocated quota system, it also identified and soughtcomment on the potential implications of the ``windfall profits'' thatwould accrue primarily to the five domestic CFC producers as a result ofthe system driving up the price of these chemicals. The Agency also notedfor public comment the potential need to augment this system with directregulation of key user groups to ensure that low-cost reductions were undertakenas soon as they become cost-effective (termed the hybrid option in theDecember 14 NPRM). EPA presented and sought comment on several other regulatory approaches.As an alternative to allocating rights to past producers and importers,the NPRM discussed the possibility of auctioning rights to the highestbidder. The price paid at auction for the rights would reflect the expectedhigher market price for the controlled substances and any such increasewould be paid to the United States Treasury instead of the producers. However,EPA raised concerns about the large uncertainties bidders would likelyface during the early stages of an auction and the potential impact ofparticipation by large users or speculators. A third option presented by EPA involved the use of a regulatory fee. Underthis option, CFC and halon production would be assessed a fee set at alevel sufficient to raise prices that would in turn reduce demand to therequisite level. Like auctions, this approach would result in price increasesfrom controlled substances (i.e., the transfers) going to the United StatesTreasury. However, because of the uncertainties in determining the levelof a fee necessary to achieve a desired reduction, the NPRM pointed outthat use of a fee by itself would make it difficult to ensure United States'compliance with the Montreal Protocol. In contrast to the above options which all rely on economic incentives,EPA also discussed the possibility of employing the Agency's traditionalregulatory approach_industry-specific control requirements. Under thisapproach, EPA would target and require controls on specific uses of CFCsand halons. However, as with regulatory fees, use of this option by itselfwould not ensure that the United States would meet the Protocol's controlrequirements (e.g., growth in unregulated uses could offset reductionsfrom required controls). On January 7 and 8, 1988, EPA held a public hearing in Washington, DC,to receive oral testimony on the NPRM. Approximately 25 witnesses representingproducer and user industries, the scientific community, and public interestgroups presented testimony at the hearing. A transcript of the hearingis contained in the public docket. The public comment period on the December proposal closed on February 8,1988. EPA received almost 500 comments including submissions by the majorCFC and halon producers, most of the trade associations and large companiesin industries which use these chemicals, interested citizens, other federalagencies, and public interest groups. Because of the volume of these comments,EPA has prepared and placed in the docket a separate document, ``BackgroundInformation Document: Stratospheric Ozone Protection Rulemaking,'' whichdescribes and responds to each of the significant issues raised in thepublic comments. This document is incorporated by reference in this notice.In addition, throughout this preamble, key issues raised in the publiccomments are identified and EPA's response provided, along with any changesin the final rule which may have resulted. C. December 14, 1987 Final Rule In addition to its NPRM, EPA also published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on December 14, 1987 a final rule (40 CFR 82.20;52 FR 47486) requiring firms to document and report to EPA the amount ofcontrolled substances they had produced, imported and/or exported in 1986.EPA needed this data to provide the United Nations Environment Program(UNEP) with a preliminary estimate of the United States' 1986 consumptionand production of controlled substances and to develop company-specificapportionments of production and consumption rights. D. May 24, 1988 Supplementary Proposal On May 24, 1988, EPA issued a supplemental proposal which set forth company-specificapportionments of production and consumption rights (53 FR 18800). It alsoaddressed issues raised by responses to the December 14 proposed and finalrules relating to the apportionment of rights and implementation of theproposed rule. These issues and EPA's final resolution of them in lightof the May supplemental proposal are described in later sections of thispreamble. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Statutory Authority and Applicable Legal Test </ITAG>A. Statutory Authority EPA is promulgating this final rule under section 157(b) of the Clean AirAct, 42 U.S.C. 7457(b). That section authorizes the Administrator to issue``regulations for the control of any substance, practice, process, or activity[or any combination thereof] which in his judgment may reasonably be anticipatedto affect the stratosphere, especially ozone in the stratosphere, if sucheffect in the stratosphere may reasonably be anticipated to endanger publichealth or welfare. Such regulations shall take into account the feasibilityand the costs of achieving such control.'' As the Agency pointed out in its December 14 NPRM, two aspects of thisregulatory authority are notable. First, the Administrator is not requiredto prove that a ``substance, practice, process or activity'' does in factdeplete stratospheric ozone before he may regulate it. Congress recognizedthe potentially serious health and environmental consequences of ozonedepletion if it were occurring, and authorized EPA to act in the face ofscientific uncertainty. Second, the Administrator is given broad latitudeto choose what and how to regulate. He is not limited to controlling ozone-depletingsubstances themselves; he may also regulate ``any practice, process, activity''that threatens the ozone layer. Nor is he limited to a particular controlstrategy. He may employ the regulatory options he finds appropriate tocontrol threats to stratospheric ozone that in turn threaten public healthand welfare. B. Applicable Legal Test Commenters on the Agency's proposal agreed that section 157(b) authorizesEPA to promulgate regulations to protect stratospheric ozone as neededto protect public health and welfare. However, several environmental groupsdisagreed with EPA's judgment that implementation of the Montreal Protocolwill satisfy that section. They argued that EPA is obligated to requirefurther, faster reductions in CFCs and halons based on evidence that theAgency expressly found insufficient as a basis for taking regulatory actionat this time. They also asserted that EPA is obligated to take unilateralaction as needed to protect stratospheric ozone, and cannot make its regulationscontingent on an international agreement taking effect.At the heart of these commenters' argument is an interpretation of section157(b) that obligates EPA to protect against all ``potential'' dangersinvolving stratospheric ozone. They find this obligation in the section'sprovision for controls of virtually anything ``which in [the Administrator's]judgment <T3>may reasonably be anticipated to affect </T3>the stratosphere, * ** if such effect * * * <T3>may reasonably be anticipated to endanger </T3>public health or welfare''(emphasis added). The ``reasonably anticipated'' language, they contend,requires EPA to act when there is potential danger, not just when dangeris certain. Moreover, when a global resource like stratospheric ozone isat stake, they assert that the Act requires EPA to regulate to protectthe resource even if there is more uncertainty than is considered tolerableregarding more limited dangers. EPA agrees that section 157(b) takes a precautionary approach to protectingstratospheric ozone. Both its language and legislative history make clearthat EPA is authorized to regulate before harm occurs and, optimally, toprevent harm. However, EPA does not agree that section 157(b) requiresthe Agency to prevent all potential harm. ``Reasonably anticipated'' harmconnotes a likely harm or a harm whose likelihood and magnitude togetherare large enough to make preventive measures reasonable. Put another way,section 157(b) authorizes EPA to assess the risks of stratospheric ozonedepletion and to regulate as the assessment warrants. The legislative history of section 157(b) confirms that Congress intendedthe Agency to assess risks and regulate on that basis. The ``reasonablyanticipated'' language was crafted against the backdrop of recent DC Circuitopinions in <T3>Ethyl Corporation v. EPA </T3>on the Agency's authority under the 1970Clean Air Act to reduce the lead in gasoline. A three judge panel had heldthat EPA must prove that lead in gasoline by itself caused significantharm, notwithstanding the likely impossibility of making that case beforethe harm actually occurred. The panel's decision was later reversed bythe court <T3>en banc </T3>(541 F.2d 1 (1976)), which found that the Act authorizedEPA to act before harm occurred based on its assessment of risk. Congress, in revising the Act, sought to codify the <T3>en banc </T3>panel's decision. The House Committee which drafted section157(b) stated in its report that it had used ``a standardized basis forfuture rulemaking to protect the public health: the Administrator may regulatea pollutant, emissions of `which in his judgment cause or contribute toair pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public healthor welfare.' '' It explained that the purpose of this standardized basiswas, among other things, to ``authorize the Administrator to weigh risksand make reasonable projections of future trends,'' and ``to reflect awarenessof uncertainties and limitations in the data which will be available tothe Administrator in the foreseeable future * * *'' The committee also included the words ``in [the Administrator's] judgment''in the foregoing phrase ``to emphasize the necessarily judgmental elementin the task of predicting future health risks of present action and toconfer upon the Administrator the requisite authority to exercise suchjudgment.'' Specifically in reference to section 157(b), the committeequoted with approval another committee's statement that ``the phrase `mayreasonably be anticipated' is intended to give the Administrator discretionin proposing and promulgating regulations.'' Congress, however, did not authorize EPA to assess risks based on a ``crystalball'' inquiry. The House Committee report indicates that Congress expectedEPA's risk assessments to be based on evidence that had been adequatelyadduced (e.g., measured against any critical comments) and rationally applied.Again in reference to section 157(b), the Committee adopted another committee'sexplanation that the Administrator should rely on reputable scientificdata that, while not immune from challenge, must be reasonably reliable.EPA therefore reads section 157(b) as authorizing regulation to reduceor eliminate risks that the Agency considers will ``endanger'' health basedon available, reliable evidence. Whether or not a risk warrants a regulatoryresponse depends on the likelihood of the harm occurring and the magnitudeof the harm that would occur; for example, the risk of an improbable, butpotentially far-reaching harm may still warrant reduction or elimination.Obviously, the characterization of a risk entails the exercise of judgment,and the statute makes clear that the Administrator is authorized to exercisesuch judgment. EPA also believes that in deciding whether and how to regulate under section157(b) it may consider other countries' effect on stratospheric ozone andthe effect of United States action on other countries' willingness to takeregulatory action. There is no dispute that the cause and effects of ozonedepletion are global in nature. Ozone-depleting emissions from all nationsmix in the atmosphere and threaten the stratosphere above every nation.Thus, in order to assess the risk of ozone depletion and the need for regulatoryaction, EPA must consider other nations' actions affecting the stratosphere.A logical next step in this analysis is what effect United States actioncould have on other nations' actions now and in the future. Consideration of the international ramifications of United States actionis also appropriate in analyzing the cost and feasibility of controls,as required by section 157(b). The legislative history of that sectionindicates that Congress expected the Agency to use the cost and feasibilityanalysis to determine the most appropriate means of protecting the stratosphere.Certainly other nations' ozone-depleting emissions or control of emissionsaffect the cost of United States' controls, and the need for other nationsto limit their emissions may make appropriate United States action thatencourages, or does not discourage, other nations to agree to such limits.A recent DC Circuit case confirms that EPA may consider potential internationalramifications in making a regulatory decision, where, as here, those ramificationsare relevant to achieving the statutory purpose. In <T3>National Coalition Against the Misuse of Pesticides </T3>v. <T3>Thomas, </T3>815 F. 2d 1579 (DC Cir. 1987), the court upheld the Agency'sdecision to extend the period of time imported mangoes could be treatedwith a particular pesticide because a contrary decision could have jeopardizedmango-producing nations' willingness to find and use a safer alternative.The relevant statutory purpose was to ensure the safety of the United Statesfood supply, and the court found that the Agency reasonably concluded thatloss of other nations' cooperation in that endeavor posed a greater riskto the food supply than short-term use of the pesticide. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Risk Assessment </ITAG>As noted above, EPA prepared an assessment of the risks of stratosphericozone depletion to provide a basis both for United States' participationin negotiation of an international control protocol and for a regulatorydecision on the need for future domestic control of ozone-depleting substances(EPA, 1987). The risk assessment was reviewed in draft form by an SAB subcommitteemade up of independent experts in the disciplines relevant to predictingozone depletion and its effects. At the same time, the draft assessmentwas made available for public comment. Based on comments from the subcommittee,its individual members, and the public, EPA revised the risk assessmentand submitted the revised version to the SAB subcommittee for further review.In its closure letter of January 29, 1988, the head of the Subcommitteestated that the final assessment ``adequately responded to the Subcommittee'sadvice on all major scientific issues''. EPA used the risk assessment as the basis for its regulatory impact analysis(RIA) and proposed rule. These documents examine in detail: Past and futuretrends in trace gases that affect ozone levels; measurements of atmosphericlevels of ozone; estimates of future changes in ozone levels derived fromatmospheric models; and health and environmental effects that would beassociated with depletion of the ozone layer. A. Past and Future Changes in Atmospheric Composition As the Agency explained in its December 14 NPRM, measurements taken overthe past several decades of the chemical composition of the earth's atmospherehave demonstrated that human activities are altering its make-up. In particular,the atmospheric concentrations of CFCs and halons, which destroy stratosphericozone, have been increasing. For example, the atmospheric concentrationsof CFC-11 and -12 have been increasing at an annual rate of 5 percent duringthe past decade (WMO, 1986). Other gases which act to slow or offset thedestruction of ozone have also been increasing. For example, carbon dioxidelevels have increased by 25 percent since the beginning of the industrialrevolution (WMO, 1986), and methane concentrations have increased at anannual rate of .017 parts per million during the past decade (EPA, 1987).Future changes in atmospheric concentrations of these gases will determinethe net impact on the ozone layer. As part of its risk assessment, EPAdeveloped scenarios for future trends in the growth of these gases. Thesescenarios were also used in the RIA prepared in support of this rule. The scenario used in the RIA to characterize what would happen absent controls(``the baseline'') assumed the following growth rates:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>1._<T4>Projected Global Growth Rates for Ozone-Modifying Compounds \1\  </T4><H1>  </H1><H1>1986-1992 </H1><H1>1992-2000 </H1><H1>2000-2050 </H1><H1>2050-2075</H1>  <ITAG tagnum="1">CFC-11 <D>4.34 </D><D>2.71 </D><D>2.50 </D><D>0.00 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">CFC-12 <D>5.32 </D><D>3.06 </D><D>2.50 </D><D>0.00 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">CFC-113 <D>7.03 </D><D>4.09 </D><D>2.50 </D><D>0.00 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">CFC 114 <D>4.95 </D><D>2.79 </D><D>2.50 </D><D>0.00 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">CFC-115 <D>3.20 </D><D>2.73 </D><D>2.50 </D><D>0.00 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Halon 1211 <D>9.77 </D><D>4.80 </D><D>2.93 </D><D>0.00 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Halon 1301 <D>3.46 </D><D> ^2.20 </D><D>3.16 </D><D>0.00 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">HCFC-22 <D>4.37 </D><D>2.74 </D><D>2.50 </D><D>0.00 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Methyl Chloroform <D>4.70 </D><D>2.78 </D><D>2.50 </D><D>0.00 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Carbon Tetrachloride <D>4.90 </D><D>2.91 </D><D>2.50 </D><D>0.00 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Carbon dioxide <D/><D/><D>0.5%/yr</D><D> </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nitrous oxide <D/><D/><D>0.2%/yr</D><D> </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Methane <D>(\2\)</D><D>(\2\)</D><D>(\2\)</D><D>(\2\)  </D><F>\1\ Average annual rates computed using data cited in Exhibit 4-5 ofthe RIA.

Several chemical producers and organizations criticized EPA's baselinetrace gas scenario. One stated that the Agency's choice of 0.017 partsper million annual growth rate for methane and 0.2 annual percent growthrate for nitrous oxide concentrations differed from the standard assumptionsgenerally used by atmospheric modelers and that they had not been reviewedby the SAB subcommittee. Others criticized EPA's projection of sustainedgrowth for methyl chloroform and HCFC-22 as being unrealistic. Severalpublic interest groups objected that EPA did not assume future controlson carbon dioxide and methane which slow the rate of ozone depletion butalso contribute to global warming. They argued that the potentially catastrophiceffects of global warming made EPA's assumption of continued uncontrolledgrowth of greenhouse gases unreasonable. EPA believes that its baseline trace gas scenario represents appropriateassumptions based on the best available scientific information. In thecase of methane, the Agency's choice of a growth rate for changes in atmosphericconcentrations is based on a survey of the research groups involved inmethane measurements. Moreover, a methane growth rate almost used identicalto that by EPA was recently described as ``the best current descriptionof growth in CH<T2>4</T2> concentrations'' in an article on methane published after thecompletion of the risk assessment. (Blake, 1988). EPA's choice of a growthrate for nitrous oxide is also fully consistent with the available scientificliterature. Contrary to the assertion of one commenter, these baselinetrace gas growth rate assumptions were included in the second draft ofEPA's risk assessment summary that the SAB subcommittee reviewed and approved,and in any event fall well within the range of assumptions approved bythe subcommittee both in the assessment's draft and final forms. Finally,recognizing the uncertainties inherent in making long term projections,EPA included in the RIA sensitivity analyses which examine the impact onpredicted ozone depletion of alternative trace gas scenarios. These analysesindicate that none of the RIA's conclusions would be significantly modifiedby changing these trace gases assumptions along the lines suggested bythe commenters. EPA also believes that the growth rates assumed in its scenarios for HCFC-22and methyl chloroform are reasonable. These chemicals continue to be widelyused in the United States and their use abroad has been expanding and islikely to continue to increase over time. To the extent these chemicalsmay be substituted for CFCs in the future, the EPA baseline scenarios mayactually underestimate future growth in these chemicals. EPA does not believe it appropriate to assume at this time in its baselinecase that controls will be imposed on greenhouse gases. Commenters whoargue that EPA must assume controls misconstrue the reason behind the Agency'sassumption of continued growth of greenhouse gases. The purpose of therulemaking is to promulgate controls needed to protect stratospheric ozone.In assessing what controls are needed, the Agency has taken the world asit is; since no action has yet been instituted to limit greenhouse gases,the Agency assumes no controls on these gases in its baseline case. Moreover,until action is instituted, EPA has no reliable basis for predicting thetiming or stringency of future controls. However, because of the Agency's concern about the potential impact ofcontinued growth in greenhouse gas emissions, EPA did examine as part ofits sensitivity analysis in the RIA the impact of limiting growth in carbondioxide and methane. The analysis shows that in the absence of controlson any of the relevant trace gases, the EPA baseline scenario would resultin a global equilibrium temperature increase of 6.0 degrees centigradeby 2075. The scenario reflecting the reductions in CFCs and halons requiredby the Montreal Protocol would reduce the projected global warming equilibriumtemperature to 4.3 degrees centigrade by 2075. Because methane and carbondioxide act to increase ozone, if controls are placed on them to limitglobal warming to an equilibrium warming of 2.0 degrees centigrade by 2075,the resulting effect would be to increase ozone depletion by the date fromunder 2 percent (in the case of implementing the Montreal Protocol) toaround 6 percent. While a consideration of potential global warming isoutside the scope of this rulemaking, EPA recognizes that because the sametrace gases govern both climate change and ozone depletion, these issuesare closely connected. Should future steps be taken to address global warming,the Agency will consider the need to revise its CFC and halon control requirementsto ensure that the stratospheric ozone layer is maintained.Seven chemical producers and users stated that EPA's baseline and otherscenarios incorrectly assumed that CFC and halon use would grow unabatedin the future despite evidence of ozone depletion (i.e., firms would voluntarilyreduce CFC and halon use). EPA's assumption concerning baseline growthof CFCs and halons was the product of several years of analysis and reviewincluding many different studies undertaken both here and abroad. (Fora summary of these studies, see chapter 4 of the RIA). The goal of thesestudies was to project demand for these chemicals in the absence of regulation.Given the long time period covered by these projections (typically manydecades to over a century, the atmospheric lifetimes of CFCs and halons),considerable uncertainty in the estimates is unavoidable. Nonetheless,the studies demonstrate that in the absence of regulation substantial sustainedgrowth in demand for CFCs and halons would be likely. The notion that firms would shift away from CFCs and halons in the faceof evidence of ozone depletion is fIawed for two reasons. First, it doesnot comport with recent history. Despite the fact that over the past twoyears public concern and scientific evidence about the threat of ozonedepletion has grown, use of these chemicals has surged by an annual averageof 11.5 percent rather than slackened. Second, it misunderstands the roleof the baseline in a regulatory analysis. The baseline serves as the basisfor estimating costs of shifting away from harmful chemicals. If EPA decidednot to regulate CFCs and halons and the ozone layer thinned, some firmsindeed might reduce their use voluntarily or in response to public pressure.However, because section 157(b) requires EPA to consider total costs ofprotecting the ozone layer, EPA appropriately considered all costs to society,including the cost incurred by firms in shifting away from CFCs and halonseither in response to regulation or as a voluntary action. B. Past and Future Changes in Ozone Levels Measurements of changes in atmospheric concentrations of ozone-modifyinggases provide only indirect evidence that human activities may be alteringthe ozone layer. Two other methods for analyzing the risk of ozone depletionare direct measurement of ozone to detect any trends and use of atmosphericmodels to project future ozone trends based on assumed changes in atmosphericlevels of ozone-modifying gases. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Direct Measurements of Ozone Levels </ITAG>In the preamble to the December 14 proposal, EPA described the extent andsignificance of available satellite and ground-based measurements of ozone.The Agency cited the 1986 World Meteorological Organization (WMO) assessmentwhich concluded that measurements available at the time revealed no statisticallysignificant change in total column ozone, and noted that the WMO conclusionwas consistent with then current atmospheric theories and models. EPA also noted, however, recently released preliminary evidence that suggestedsome depletion of stratospheric ozone had already occurred. It describedthe recently discovered seasonal ``hole'' in the ozone layer above Antarcticaand the recent data that strongly suggested anomalous chlorine chemistryplays a role in the hole's formation. EPA concluded, however, that toomany questions remained as to the cause and implications of the hole forthe Agency to take it into account in its projections of global ozone depletionand, by extension, its regulatory decision-making. The Agency also noted a recent article containing data that called intoquestion the conclusion that <T3>global </T3>ozone levels had not decreased. Preliminary assessmentsof the ground-based and satellite measurements suggested that depletionof up to five percent had occurred over the past one or two decades. However,the data suggesting that ozone had depleted globally had not yet been publishedin the scientific literature and therefore had not yet been thoroughlyreviewed. EPA explained that interpretation of such data was complex becauseof the need to address issues of calibration and instrument drift, amongothers. In addition to validating and quantifying the trend itself, EPAalso cited the need to distinguish ozone losses related to man-made chlorinefrom those related to natural causes (e.g., solar cycle, volcanic activity).The Agency noted that a thorough review of both that data and researchon the Antarctic ozone hole had been recently initiated by a group of theworld's leading atmospheric researchers under the auspices of UNEP, WMO,NASA and NOAA (the Ozone Trends Panel), and decided that until the datahad been adequately reviewed and analyzed by the scientific community,it should not be used in its risk assessment or regulatory decision-making.Environmental groups commenting on EPA's proposal strongly disagreed withthe Agency's decision not to factor into its risk assessment and regulatorydecision-making the Antarctic hole and global ozone trends data. Whileapparently acknowledging that at the time of the proposal there was inadequateevidence linking CFCs with the Antarctic hole, they argued that a scientificconsensus had since emerged that CFCs are a cause of the hole. They alsoasserted that the Ozone Trend Panel's review of the ozone trends data was``expected'' to conclude that ozone depletion of several percent had alreadyoccurred. Many industry commenters, on the other hand, agreed with theAgency's judgment that the Antarctic and global ozone trends data wereeither too preliminary or inconclusive to provide a basis for regulatoryaction. But some of these commenters complained that the Agency focusedtoo much on the data, given its judgment that the data were insufficientto support regulatory action. EPA stands by its conclusion that the Agency should not rely on the preliminaryevidence of either the Antarctic hole phenomenon or apparent global ozonedepletion in this rulemaking. As discussed earlier, Congress gave EPA broaddiscretion to weigh the available evidence, but it indicated that the Agencyshould base regulatory decisions on evidence that ``is adequately adduced''and ``reasonably reliable.'' Relatedly, Congress did not intend EPA toprotect against any risk of ozone depletion; it instead authorized EPAto regulate in the case of risks it finds ``will endanger'' public healthand welfare. EPA judged that the preliminary Antarctic ozone hole data was insufficientto conclude that public health and welfare would be ``endangered'' by thehole's existence. The preliminary data left unanswered important questionslike whether the mechanisms causing the hole are unique to Antarctica,whether losses in Antarctica alone influence global ozone levels, and whetherthe hole will have other direct and indirect effects on the rest of theworld. At the time of the December proposal, the preliminary global ozonetrends data, in turn, were not adequately adduced or reasonably reliablefor purposes of assessing risks or making regulatory decisions. The datawas not peer-reviewed for accuracy and significance and the Agency couldnot rely on ``expectations'' of what that review would show. In the caseof ozone measurements, peer review is particularly important because ofthe difficult issues of interpretation they pose. EPA thus found it appropriateto await completion of the Ozone Trends Panel review of the data beforebasing its risk assessment and regulatory decisions upon it.Industry concerns that EPA overemphasized the preliminary data are alsomisplaced. As noted above, EPA carefully described the limitations of thedata concerning these phenomenon and expressly rejected relying on thedata in this rulemaking. Moreover, the atmospheric models used in its riskassessment and RIA do not account either for the Antarctic ozone hole orfor observed losses in ozone during the decade. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Ozone Trends Panel Report </ITAG>In March of this year, the Ozone Trends Panel released the executive summaryof its report; release of the body of the report is expected in August.The panel concluded that stratospheric ozone has already been depletedon a global basis more than researchers had previously thought, thoughnot as much as the preliminary satellite data had suggested. The panelalso stated that ``the observed changes [in global ozone] may be due wholely,or in part, to the increased atmospheric abundance of trace gases, primarily[CFCs],'' and that the Antarctic ozone hole is clearly linked to CFCs.An obvious implication of its conclusions is that EPA's risk assessmentprobably underestimates the risk of ozone depletion. Notwithstanding the likely significance of the Ozone Trends Panel report,EPA is not in a position to consider it in this rulemaking. As noted above,the full report, including the data and analyses supporting the summary'sconclusions, are not yet available for either the Agency or the publicto review. Before relying on the summary's conclusions, EPA has the responsibilityto review the underlying report; the Agency cannot delegate its duty tomake an informed judgment on the adequacy and implications of the new information.Even if EPA could rely on the report's summary alone, the Clean Air Actwould require that the public be given an opportunity to comment on thesummary if the Agency intended to base its regulatory decision on it. However,the August 1 court-ordered deadline governing this rulemaking did not leavesufficient time for the Agency to provide the public with a meaningfulchance to comment on the summary's significance for the proposed rule.The scientific community will require at least several months to performthe analyses and model revisions needed to assess the significance of thenew information. Complicated analysis will be required to determine whataspects of current atmospheric models must be altered to more accuratelyreflect recent changes in ozone levels both in the Antarctic and globally.EPA will then have to review these model changes and undertake its ownassessment of risks. This effort would have left too little time to publishand obtain comment on any revised risk assessment and regulatory responseand still meet the August deadline for a final rule. Moreover, even if no court-ordered deadline pertained to this rulemaking,EPA could not have delayed the rulemaking to the extent analyzing and providingpublic comment on the summary would have required. The Protocol's freezemay take effect as early as July of next year; if EPA is to provide industrywith leadtime to comply with the freeze, it cannot long delay promulgationof the final rule. The Agency is nonetheless concerned about the implications of the conclusionsdrawn by the Ozone Trends Panel. Administrator Thomas, in an April 7, 1988letter, has called on the Executive Director of UNEP to expedite the Protocol'sreview process to allow parties to determine at the earliest possible datethe need for additional restrictions. The United States, along with othercountries, is now actively engaged in planning for the review on an expeditedschedule following entry into force of the Protocol. Under the revisedschedule, the assessments called for in the Protocol are tentatively scheduledto be completed by mid-1989, which would allow the Parties to meet to beginconsidering the need for additional steps by fall of next year.EPA is also in the process of updating its risk assessment and will evaluatethe Ozone Trends Panel report and all other new scientific informationin the updated assessment. Assuming the panel's full report is releasedin August, EPA expects to complete its update by early 1989. EPA discussesfurther the summary findings of the Ozone Trends Panel in the ANPRM alsopublished today in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, and states that it intends to seek public commenton the full report when it becomes available. Based on its revised RiskAssessment, the Agency will determine what further actions, if any, arenecessary. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Use of Atmospheric Models in Predicting Future Ozone Depletion</ITAG>Direct measurements indicate past changes in ozone levels, but atmosphericmodels are the only available tool for predicting future trends in ozone.These models, in more or less detail, attempt to replicate the forces thatdetermine ozone levels. Two basic types of atmospheric models have beendeveloped. One-dimensional (1-D) models predict ozone levels on a globallyaveraged basis, while two-dimensional (2-D) models also predict ozone levelsby latitude and season. For its risk assessment and RIA, EPA used a simplified version of a 1-Dmodel to analyze different scenarios of ozone-modifying gas growth andcontrol. In the preamble to its December 14 proposal, the Agency explainedthat while 2-D models provide more information relevant to calculatingthe impacts of depletion, they are expensive and time-consuming to useand far from uniform in their results. The Agency recognized the relativelimitations of 1-D models, but concluded that they were the best availabletools for the purposes of risk assessment (e.g., analyzing the impact ondepletion of many different control scenarios). Several commenters raised issues concerning EPA's use of a simplified 1-Dmodel as its primary risk assessment tool. One chemical producer urgedthat the full 1-D model, as opposed to the simplification, be used forregulatory decision-making, and added that the model the Agency used wasoutdated. Several environmental groups argued that EPA should have usedthe more sophisticated 2-D models. The Agency chose to use the parameterized version of the 1-D model becauseit provided a relatively low-cost means of analyzing different trace gasscenarios without losing much of the original model's precision. Underthe auspices of UNEP, results of the parameterized model EPA used werecompared with results from the major 1-D models of the world. The studyconcluded that ``[w]ithin the existing limitation of models to accuratelysimulate the real stratosphere, all models including the fully parameterizedmodel, predicted, within acceptable limits, similar ozone depletions forgiven control scenarios.'' As noted by one of the commenters, the parameterization EPA used was revisedfollowing preparation of the original risk assessment. Minor changes inseveral coefficients were made. However, the revised and original methodsgave essentially the same results, so EPA continued to use for its RIAthe original version of the model which had been reviewed and approvedby the SAB. The Agency chose not to use 2-D models because, not only are they substantiallymore expensive and time-consuming to use, but there is much less agreementbetween 2-D model results than now exists for 1-D models. While all 2-Dmodels show that ozone depletion varies with latitude, they differ widelyin the size of the latitudinal gradient they project and even in what hemispherethey predict a gradient. These differences reflect the fact that 2-D modelsare attempting to replicate atmospheric transport mechanisms that are extremelycomplex and not yet well understood. While 2-D models are potentially powerfulin their predictive capacities, they still require substantial development.What can be gleaned from them now is the basic finding that ozone depletionwill be greater at higher latitudes and may be greater on a global averagethan 1-D models predict. In comparing these two types of models, the 1987WMO assessment concluded that, ``[t]here is no indication at present thatresults from two-dimensional models should invalidate in a gross senseassessment studies with one-dimensional models.'' A more fundamental fact in considering the choice of models is that nomodel now exists that accurately mirrors the complex processes which affectstratospheric ozone; the results of all models are approximate, at best.In summarizing the conclusions of its risk assessment, EPA stated, ``whilethe [atmospheric chemistry] models replicate many of the characteristicsof the atmosphere accurately, they are inconsistent with measured valuesof other constituents, thus lowering our confidence in their ability topredict future ozone changes accurately.'' In short, while models providethe best available tool for evaluating future ozone trends, they providerough approximations at best. Regardless of the type of model used, theinherent limits of our current ability to precisely predict future atmosphericchanges must not be overlooked. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Future Trends in Ozone Levels Assuming No Controls </ITAG>Using the parameterized 1-D model, EPA examined the potential impact ofits trace gases scenarios on ozone depletion. Table 2 shows the resultsof its analysis. For the baseline scenario, depletion is projected to beginaround the turn of the century and increase sharply through the next century.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s25,7 </C><T4>Table </T4>2._Estimated Ozone Depletion for Baseline Scenario  <H1>Year </H1><H1>Percent depletion</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">2000 <D>1.0 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2025 <D>4.6 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2050 <D>15.7 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2075 <D>\1\ 50.0 </D><F>\1\ Because of limits in the range of accuracy of the model, ozone depletionwas arbitrarily constrained at 50 percent.

Health and Environmental Impacts Under current atmospheric conditions, the ozone layer blocks most of thedamaging ultraviolet radiation (UV-B) from penetrating to the earth's surface.As part of its risk assessment, EPA examined a wide range of potentialhealth and environmental impacts from increased exposure to UV-B radiationas a result of ozone depletion. Research to date has identified the following areas of potential harm tohuman health: increased incidence of melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancersand cataracts, and suppression of the immune system. Because the exactnature of the dose-response relationship between increased exposure toUV-B radiation and the incidence of skin cancers and cataracts is uncertain,a range of values were used in the analysis. These estimates are presentedin section V, below. Insufficient information exists to quantify potentialeffects related to immune suppression. Limited experiments have also linked increased UV-B exposure to damageto plants and aquatic organisms, accelerated weathering of certain manmadematerials, and increased formation of ground-level ozone (smog). Whilestudies completed to date suggest that substantial damage in each of theseareas is likely, the limited nature of the studies make it difficult togeneralize and quantify the potential effects. For its RIA, EPA drew fromthe existing studies to provide limited estimates of potential damage,but the Agency recognizes that substantially more research in each of theseareas is needed. The results of the analysis contained in the RIA are presentedbelow in section V. Because the gases that affect ozone also contribute to global warming,the Agency's risk assessment also examines the likely health and environmentalimpact of the greenhouse effect if emissions of these gases continue togrow. Global warming is likely to lead to changes in temperature and precipitation,increased sea level, and changes in storm patterns and frequency. Thesechanges could affect agriculture, forests, development patterns, waterquality and a wide range of other health and environmental factors. Giventhe limited information available to quantify these potential impacts,EPA only included in its RIA a case study of the impact of sea level rise.This is explained in Chapter 8 of the RIA and below in section V. D. Conclusion Based on its risk assessment and RIA, the Agency has concluded that continuedgrowth in CFCs and halons will result in substantial ozone-depletion havingserious health and environmental consequences. While many uncertaintiesexist, the current evidence presents a strong case for action to substantiallyreduce emissions of these most potent ozone depleting chemicals. A comparisonof the costs and potential benefits of differing levels of control arediscussed below. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Final Rule </ITAG>A. Scope, Stringency and Timing of Reductions As noted above, EPA proposed to implement the Montreal Protocol, providedthat the Protocol enters into force and the United States ratifies it,which the United States has since done. The Agency explained that UnitedStates implementation of the Protocol was an appropriate response to thethreat of ozone depletion for two reasons. One, EPA's assessment of availablescientific evidence indicated that adherence by the United States alongwith broad international participation in the Protocol's control requirementswould nearly eliminate the projected risk of ozone depletion. Two, EPAjudged that the obvious need for broad international adherence to the Protocolcounseled against the United States' deviating from the Protocol, becauseany significant deviation could lessen other countries' motivation to participate.To the extent the Protocol's existing control requirements were later foundmore or less stringent than necessary to protect stratospheric ozone, EPAnoted that key provisions in the agreement afford the Parties the opportunityto review and revise those requirements. The public comments on the Agency's proposed rule were virtually unanimousin supporting implementation of the Montreal Protocol. Industry and publicinterest groups alike recognized the need for a global response to thisglobal problem, and embraced the Protocol as a landmark international agreementto address an environmental threat to a critical and irreplaceable resource.These groups and others differed, however, on whether the Protocol's controlmeasures were sufficient to fully protect stratospheric ozone. In general, CFC producers and users contended that the scientific evidenceon which EPA rested its proposal did not justify the CFC reductions requiredby the Protocol except as a precautionary measure. They disagreed withEPA's assumptions concerning the future growth rates of several gases affectingozone (as discussed above) and the likely degree of international compliancewith the Protocol, and contended that more realistic assumptions wouldyield projections of total column ozone remaining stable or actually increasing.They suggested that since the science on which EPA purported to rest itsproposal did not justify the required reductions, the Agency must havetaken the Antarctic and ozone trends data into account in deciding to seekthose reductions. Industry commenters also generally agreed with EPA's concern that deviatingfrom the Protocol risked undermining it. They recognized that implementationof less stringent controls than the Protocol required would be unacceptable,and shared EPA's concern that implementation of more stringent controlswould yield little, if any, additional stratospheric protection, whilepossibly reducing other countries' incentive to join the Protocol. Theyadded that unilateral action to reduce further ozone-depleting emissionswould put United States' industry at a competitive disadvantage in worldmarkets. In contrast, environmental and other public interest groups claimed thatthe Montreal Protocol and thus EPA's proposed rule did not go far enoughfast enough in requiring reductions in ozone-depleting substances. Severalnoted EPA's own projections that (1) stratospheric ozone would still bedepleted by nearly two percent by the year 2075 under the Protocol's controlregime; (2) every one percent decrease in ozone would result in a one totwo percent increase in melanoma skin cancer incidence, among other adverseeffects; and (3) United States unilateral action to reduce CFC use by anadditional 30 percent would further reduce those adverse effects. In lightof these projections, they questioned the logic of EPA's proposal to implementthe Montreal Protocol's required reductions and no more. Their chief complaint, however, was that EPA failed to propose the virtualphaseout of CFCs and halons that they claim is needed based on the preliminaryAntarctic ozone hole and global ozone trends data. In its comments on theMay 24 NPRM proposing company-specific allocations of production and consumptionrights, one environmental group noted that the Ozone Trends Panel summaryconcluded in March that ozone-depletion had already occurred and that CFCsand halons appeared at least partly responsible. The commenter also pointedto data released in May supporting the existence of a smaller Arctic versionof the Antarctic ozone hole, and argued that both developments made clearthat a phaseout was required to protect stratospheric ozone. Several commenters also faulted the Agency for essentially relying on continueduncontrolled growth of other greenhouse gases to buffer the ozone-depletingeffects of CFCs and halons. They disagreed, moreover, with EPA's judgmentthat unilateral United States reductions beyond those required by the Protocolran a significant risk of undermining the efficacy of that agreement. Theyargued that EPA could and should use its authority under section 157(b)of the Act to leverage further reductions from other countries by immediatelyimposing restrictions on the import of products containing or made withCFCs from countries that fail to agree to make the same reductions.Finally, a number of commenters disagreed with EPA's proposal to make theregulations effective upon the Protocol's entry into force. Again, theystated that the severity of the ozone depletion problem warrants fasteraction than the Protocol requires and that unilateral United States actionwould not seriously undermine the incentive of other countries to jointhe Protocol. B. Basis for Control Requirements After carefully considering the comments received, EPA has concluded thatimplementation of the Montreal Protocol is the best course the Agency cantake at this time to securing adequate protection of stratospheric ozone.EPA's decision to implement the Protocol has two bases. One, EPA believesthat the scientific information and analyses available to the Agency andpublic in this rulemaking support a finding that the Protocol's controIrequirements are needed and reasonably adequate to protect stratosphericozone. For the reasons discussed earlier, EPA considers the preliminarynature of the data on the Antarctic ozone hole and global ozone trendsprovides an insufficient basis for regulatory action. The Agency recognizesthat the summary of the Ozone Trends Panel Report released several monthsago assessed that data and raised questions about the adequacy of the Protocol'scontrols. However, as explained above, adequate evaluation of that reportand other recently available information could not be completed beforethe close of this rulemaking. EPA also believes for reasons mentioned earlierthat it reasonably considered the need to control ozone-depleting substancesindependently of the need to control other greenhouse gases. Two, EPA believes that the Montreal Protocol's international response representsthe most effective means of protecting the ozone layer. Unilateral actionby the United States would not significantly add to efforts to protectthe ozone layer and could even be counterproductive by undermining othernations' incentive to participate in the Protocol. The Agency believesthat the best way to deal with the challenges posed by new informationis through the Protocol's review and revision process, and at the Administrator'srequest, UNEP has agreed to expedite that process so that the Parties mayconsider at the earliest possible date whether additional internationalreductions are warranted. EPA's analysis indicates that if further reductionsare required, they may be undertaken after the expedited review processis completed and still be effective in achieving stratospheric protection.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Scope of Coverage </ITAG>The final rule governs future production and consumption of CFC-11, -12,-113, -115 and Halon 1211, 1301 and 2402. These chemicals are covered bythe Protocol and, as explained in the preamble to the proposed rule, currentIypose the greatest threat to stratospheric ozone. The Agency received one comment that took issue with the scope of chemicalsproposed for regulation. The commenter, a halon producer, pointed out thatEPA's projections show that freezing the growth of halons will not reduceozone losses until well into the next century, and that a case could thusbe made for not regulating halons at this time. The Agency points out,however, that halons' long atmospheric lifetimes require that action tocontrol their use be taken now to prevent the ozone depletion EPA projectsfor the future. Halon 1301, for instance, has an estimated lifetime of110 years; thus, emissions of this chemical today will contribute to ozonedepletion far into the next century. In addition, if left unregulated,halons could grow in use. To prevent halons from becoming a greater threatto the ozone layer, EPA must limit their supply in the near term. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Stringency and Timing of Controls </ITAG>The final rule also adopts the stringency and timing of the Protocol'scontrol measures. Taken together with the scope of chemicals covered bythe rule, EPA believes based on the information in the record that itsrule is an appropriate response to the risk of stratospheric ozone depletion.Table 3 shows model projections of ozone depletion for different levelsof reductions. As explained earlier, EPA has revised its ozone depletionprojections to reflect higher CFC growth for 1987 and slightly higher CFCgrowth rates through 1992. The revised projections indicate that broadinternational implementation of the Protocol's control measures (case 3)is likely to reduce future ozone depletion from over 50 percent to lessthan 2 percent in the year 2075, with further reductions in depletion occurringafter that date as ozone increases from additional methane and carbon dioxidemore than offset losses from CFCs and halons (see chapter 6 of the RIA).The projections also illustrate that unilateral implementation of the Protocol'scontrol measures by the United States, with no other nations reducing theiruse of CFCs and halons (case 4), would halve projected depletion by 2075,but that substantial depletion would still occur. Even assuming that the United States unilaterally decreased CFC use by85 percent by 1998 (case 5), this action would only reduce projectionsof ozone depletion by 0.3 percent in 2075 compared to the Protocol case(case 3). If the United States unilaterally accelerated its reductionsand decreased by 85 percent by 1992 (case 6), projections of ozone depletionin 2075 would only be reduced by another 0.2 percent. These cases alsoassume that United States unilateral action beyond the Protocol would notreduce participation by the other nations in that agreement. In contrast,should the international community decide in the future that reductionsbeyond the Protocol are proper, a multilateral reduction of 85 percentby 1998 would result in substantially greater protection than that achievedby unilateral action (case 7).<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>3._<T4>Summary of Ozone Depletion Estimated for the </T4>8 <T4>Control Cases </T4>a <ITAG tagnum="96">[Ozone depletion reported in percent] </ITAG><H1>Case </H1><H1>2000 </H1><H1>2025 </H1><H1>2050 </H1><H1>2075</H1>  <ITAG tagnum="1">1.

EPAnotes that this particular scenario in the risk assessment assumed a totalfreeze in HCFC 22, methyl chloroform and carbon tetrachloride, as wellas the chemicals covered by the Protocol, along with all nations in theworld participating; the projections made here and in the accompanyingRIA showing that the Protocol's controls would still result in a smalldegree of ozone depletion do <T3>not</T3> assume a freeze in chemicals outside the coverage of the Protocol.This difference in assumptions accounts for the difference in projections.EPA also disagrees with comments suggesting that additional reductionsbeyond the Protocol are necessary for the Agency to meet its obligationsunder the Clean Air Act. As Table 3 illustrates, based on the informationwhich could be considered in the course of this rulemaking, EPA's analysisshows that the model's projected ozone depletion would be reduced to alevel of less than two percent. EPA believes that, given the scientificand technical limitations of its analysis and the need to obtain internationalagreement to achieve effective controls, additional unilateral reductionsare not warranted at this time. <T3>a. Limitations in Atmospheric Models. </T3>While atmospheric chemistrymodels are the best available tools for estimating future changes in ozonedepletion, they are far from exact. As discussed above and in both theWMO and EPA assessments, these models accurately reproduce some aspectsof the current atmosphere but fall far short of replicating other aspects.As a result of these acknowledged deficiencies, rigidly tying the stringencyof controls to the projections of these models is not warranted or appropriate.Moreover, Table 3 illustrates that based on current models, little differencein depletion occurs until the turn of the century. During this period additionalmeasures could be taken through the Protocol process if needed. For example,more stringent reductions on CFCs or the addition of such chemicals asmethyl chloroform (which has a shorter atmospheric lifetime) to the Protocolcould achieve further reductions in potential ozone depletion. <T3>b. Limitations in Long-Term Projections. </T3>Results from the atmosphericmodels are further limited by uncertainties concerning growth in tracegases which affect ozone. While EPA believes that its trace gas growthassumptions accurately reflect current understanding of likely future trends,the Agency recognizes the inherent limits in making projections that covermore than a century. Some of these projections (e.g., CFC growth rates)are based on factors such as long term economic growth and technologicaldevelopment which cannot be predicted with precision. Others (e.g., methane,carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide growth) are based on recent history, whichmay not prove an accurate indicator of future trends. Still others arebased on behavioral assumptions (e.g. participation in the Protocol) whichcannot be readily tested. Given these limits, the reduction in ozone depletion that a specified controllimit will provide cannot be foretold with precision. Recognizing this,the Protocol negotiators agreed to a 50 percent reduction in CFCs in partbecause a reduction of this magnitude would provide an incentive for developmentof chemical substitutes which in turn would facilitate even greater reductionsif such proved necessary. The analysis in the RIA assumes that CFC useis reduced by 50 percent in 1998 as called for in the Protocol. Yet severallarge producers and users of ozone-depleting substances have recently announcedtheir intentions to phase down below this level or even phase out of thesechemicals. If this occurs, the RIA's analysis could actually overstatethe amount of long-term ozone depletion which could result. As part of its sensitivity analysis contained in the RIA, the Agency consideredmany of the issues raised by commenters. The analysis examined alternativeassumptions in the following areas: higher and lower growth in methane,carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide; different rates of participation by developedand developing nations in the Montreal Protocol; and different baselinegrowth rates of CFCs. The results of this sensitivity analysis illustratethat projected ozone depletion could increase or decrease (or that ozonecould even slightly accrete) under certain scenarios for any of a numberof reasons. Given that recognized uncertainties in the analysis are onthe same order of magnitude as the projected residual depletion, EPA believesthat it would not be reasonable necessarily to require controls to eliminatethe residual depletion. Other factors, such as the opportunity to revisethe Protocol as new information warrants and the need for broad Protocolparticipation, are also important in deciding how much control to requirenow. <T3>c. International Considerations. </T3>As shown in Table 3, concertedinternational action represents the only effective means to safeguard theozone layer. EPA firmly believes that the ratification and implementationof the Montreal Protocol provides the most effective means of achievingthat objective. As explained below, the history leading to the Protocolprovides ample evidence that unilateral action by the United States wouldnot necessarily ensure adequate protection for the ozone layer.In 1978 the United States restricted the use of CFCs in aerosols. Whileseveral nations adopted similar restrictions (e.g., Sweden, Canada, Norway)and others partially cut back this use (European nations, Japan), therewas no widespread movement to follow the United States' lead. Concernsexisted then that other nations had failed to act because the United Statesand a few other nations were making the reductions thought necessary toprotect the ozone layer. Similar concerns exist today that uniIateral actioncould result in ``free riding'' by some other nations. More recently, negotiations leading to the Montreal Protocol can be tracedback to the early 1980s. The initial round of negotiations were concludedin 1985 when the involved nations agreed on the Vienna Convention for theProtection of the Ozone Layer but failed to agree on specific actions tolimit ozone-depleting chemicals. This failure resulted, in part, from thefact that some nations had already taken different interim approaches tolimiting CFCs and from the lack of a common understanding of the underlyingscience and risks. During the year following the first round of negotiationsand leading up to the second, a major international assessment of atmosphericissues was conducted (WMO assessment) and international workshops on healthand environmental effects and on economic and technological issues wereconvened. These assessments provided the common base of information whichled in September 1987 to agreement on the Montreal Protocol. Thus, in past efforts to obtain international controls, the United Stateshas been most effective not by taking unilateral action but instead byactively participating in international assessments and by aggressivelypursuing a strong global agreement. Recognizing the utility of the international assessment process and thesignificant scientific, technical, economic and environmental uncertaintiesthat remain, the Protocol explicitly provides for periodic ``assessmentand review of control measures.'' EPA believes that this process, as agreedto by nations becoming Party to the Protocol, represents the most effectivevehicle for obtaining further reductions, if such prove necessary. Butthe essential first step is satisfying the conditions for entry into force.EPA's Administrator sent a letter to his counterparts in May of this yearurging their ratification of the Protocol. Based on recent information,it appears that the January 1, 1989 target date for entry into force willbe met. Once entry into force has occurred, the next step will be to conduct theassessments called for in the Protocol on an expedited schedule and allowthe Parties to decide if additional actions are warranted. As discussedabove, EPA has initiated several actions to facilitate that process, andUNEP's schedule for assessment and review has been moved forward in time.Given that the Protocol process appears likely to be effective in addressingthe need for additional controls in a timely manner, EPA believes thatunilateral action by the United States would not significantly contributeto protecting the ozone layer and might even make it more difficult toutilize the Protocol process to achieve the necessary international consensusfor action. Unilateral United States action could appear to reduce theurgency of reviewing the Protocol's control measures, and unilateral actionsaccompanied by trade sanctions, such as some commenters suggest, couldlead to counteractions well beyond the scope of protecting stratosphericozone, making future agreement more difficult. EPA also rejects several commenters' suggestion that EPA's regulation shouldtake effect immediately and not be linked to entry into force of the Protocol.EPA believes that the environmental benefits from delaying implementationfor a few months would be small compared to potentially large economiccosts to United States industry of acting in advance of other Parties tothe Protocol. Entry into force now appears likely by January 1, 1989. Withsuccess so near, EPA does not want to take unilateral action that couldreduce the impetus for other nations to join the Protocol in a timely manner.C. Selection of Regulatory System EPA considered many different strategies for implementing the requirementsof the Montreal Protocol including traditional engineering controls andeconomic based programs. The Agency explained that the latter type of programwould utilize free market incentives to achieve cost-effective controls,and suggested three specific options: Auctions, allocated quotas, and regulatoryfees. The advantages and disadvantages of each of these options (and possiblecombinations) were discussed in the December 14 NPRM. While EPA statedthat an allocated quota program was its preferred option, it sought andreceived comment on each of the options. EPA received more comments onits selection of a regulatory strategy than on any other aspect of itsDecember 14 NPRM. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Allocated Quota Option </ITAG>Under this system, producers and importers of CFCs and halons in 1986 wouldreceive production and consumption ``rights'' or allowances.\1\<NOTE/> The majority of commenters addressing this point,  includingchemical manufacturers and most major CFC and halon user groups, supportedEPA's preference for the allocated quota system for many of the same reasonsdiscussed in the December NPRM: It would ensure that the control requirementsof the Protocol are achieved; would provide for low cost, market-basedreductions; and would be administratively straightforward.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ In the December 14 NPRM, EPA used the term ``rights''to refer to what it proposed to grant producers and importers of CFCs andhalons to authorize future production and consumption of these chemicals.The Agency noted, however, that ``rights'' was used as a matter of convenience,and that what EPA proposed to grant was actually in the nature of a privilege.One commenter suggested that EPA avoid the use of such a shorthand termand therefore the need to explain it. EPA agrees and has in the final ruleand this preamble used the term ``allowances'' instead. While generally supporting the allocated quota approach, a large numberof respondents from the foam-blowing industry argued that they would beinadvertently discriminated against under such a system because chemicalproducers would shift production away from CFC-11 (the primary chemicalthey use) to other, more profitable CFCs. They also claimed that sinceCFCs are a large percentage of their final product costs, but only a smallpercentage of the product costs of other CFC-using industries (e.g., computers,refrigerators, and car air conditioners), future CFC price increases willhave a greater effect on their industry. As a result of these concerns,they argued that EPA should provide a set-aside for their industry basedon their 1986 use. EPA considered this request, but at this time believes that the disadvantagesof creating such a set-aside substantially outweigh any possible advantages.EPA has no information about whether chemical producers will shift productionaway from CFC-11 to other CFCs. Several producers have publicly statedthat, consistent with anti-trust requirements, they intend to utilize theirquotas to minimize disruption in user markets by aIlocating allowable suppliesto past customers. While EPA doubts that producers will make allocationsthat reduce their ability to earn profits, to the extent producers allocateCFC-11 to foam blowers, their concerns will be obviated. In the longerterm, which chemicals will be produced is difficult to discern. It willdepend largely on the relative timing of chemical substitutes. For example,to the extent chemical substitutes for CFC-12 and CFC-113 become availablebefore substitutes for CFC-11, within the limits established by the Protocol,even more CFC-11 than is produced today could be produced in the future.Providing a set-aside for one industry segment would also be economicallyinefficient. If EPA adopted the system proposed by the foam-blowers, theAgency would be subsidizing that industry at the expense of all other CFCusers. Other industries would have access to a reduced supply of CFCs (theallowable level minus the set-aside) and would therefore pay higher marketprices. Since foam-blowers would not have to compete against firms fromother user industries, they would likely pay lower CFC prices and consequentlyhave less incentive to reduce their use of these chemicals. Moreover, manysegments of the foam-blowing industry (e.g., foam packaging and flexiblemolded foam) have inexpensive alternatives available today and thereforewould not need a set-aside. Finally, the foam-blowers' concerns relate primarily to their alleged inabilityto pay higher prices for CFCs. The magnitude of future price increaseswill depend on the speed and rate of reductions taken by all industriesparticulary in the next few years. (See Section V, below.) As discussedat length in the accompanying ANPRM, EPA intends to closely monitor progressin achieving reductions across all CFC user industries, and may proposeto require reductions where they are available but are not being aggressivelypursued by a particular user industry. According to the RIA (Chapter 9and Appendix M), if such reductions are achieved in a timely manner, priceincreases would be substantially moderated and the concerns raised by thefoam-blowing industry would never materialize. This analysis is presentedin detail in Section V, below which describes the analysis contained inthe RIA accompanying this rule. Several auto companies, two government agencies, and several environmentalgroups were concerned that an allocated quota system would provide substantialmarket power and sizable windfalls to a small number of producers. Thesecommenters feared that producers would have an economic incentive to delaythe introduction of chemical substitutes which would thus raise the costof reducing use of ozone depleting chemicals. They also feared that producersmight restrict supply beyond the limits in the regulation, further increasingCFC prices. In addition, one of the commenters was concerned that allocatedquotas alone would, in effect, create a system under which polluters wouldprofit from their pollution. EPA shares these commenter's concerns that windfall profits could induceproducers to delay the introduction of chemical substitutes. It also recognizesthe irony that regulation by means of an allocated quota system could makemoney for the regulated industry. Despite these drawbacks, however, EPAis confident that an allocated quota system would still bring about therequired reductions in controlled substances, although at a higher costif substitutes are delayed. Since the quotas would directly limit productionand import of controlled substances, they would ensure that the Protocol'slimits are met. But should producers delay the introduction of substitutes,the cost to society of meeting those limits would be higher than it wouldotherwise be; prices of controlled substances and prices of products usingcontrolled substances would be driven higher or remain high for a longerperiod of time. Six chemical producers and an industry trade association argued that EPAhad incorrectly characterized the nature and magnitude of profits thatwould result from allocated quotas (e.g., by not taking into account higherproduction costs and taxes) and that higher prices for controlled substancesare necessary to fund the development of new chemical substitutes. EPAbelieves that it has correctly portrayed the nature of the likely windfalls(i.e., transfers) which would result from the allocated system. EPA agreesthat the costs of production of each unit of controlled substances mightincrease as the quantity of production is cut and that increased pricesfor controlled substances will also result in increased taxes paid to theU.S. Treasury. But these points do not materially alter the analysis ofwindfalls presented in the RIA. The unit costs of feedstock materials,which constitute the majority of production costs, are not likely to significantlyincrease. While the payment of taxes may decrease the actual profits toproducers, the amount of this payment to the Treasury will depend on manyfactors (e.g., corporate income tax rates) outside the scope of this analysis.Moreover, losses due to the shutdown of existing production facilitiesare also uncertain. Instead of being closed, existing production facilitiesmay be modified, in some cases to produce chemical substitutes (e.g., HCFC-22)or used to produce feedstocks for new chemicals. The ANPRM also publishedtoday in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>contains a more detailed discussion of the issueof windfalls and their long-term environmental and economic implications.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Regulatory Fees </ITAG>Regulatory fees were also offered as an option in the December 14 NPRM.In that notice, EPA raised the issue that fees, by themselves, would notensure that the required control levels were met and therefore that theUnited States' obligation under the Montreal Protocol were fulfilled. EPAwould not be able to accurately predict how many firms would elect to paythe fee and continue using CFCs and halons and how many would instead electto reduce their consumption of these chemicals. EPA also questioned andrequested comment on its legal authority under the Clean Air Act and ToxicSubstances Control Act to impose a regulatory fee. Many commenters agreed that a fee alone would not be an effective regulatoryprogram since EPA would not be able to set the fee at the correct amountto achieve the required levels of control. Ten commenters supported theuse of a fee to reduce the windfall to producers and thus, the incentivethe windfall might have created to delay the introduction of substitutes.But others, primarily from the foam-blowing industry, objected to the useof a fee on the grounds that it would unnecessarily increase their costsof doing business. Implicit in their argument is an assumption that any fee would be addedto the price of CFCs and halons above and beyond increases created by marketscarcity. Economic theory as described in two analyses sponsored by EPA,however, suggests that fees would not increase the price of controlledsubstances in such a manner. (Decanio, 1988 and Sobotka, 1988.) As longas the fee is set below the increase in price resulting from the limiton supply of CFCs, user industries would pay the same amount under eithera fee system or an allocated quota system. Price increases would be limitedby the forces of supply and demand regardless of whether they result froma fee or regulatory mandated scarcity. With fees, however, the windfallsgo to the United States Treasury, while under a quota system, the transferswould go to the producers. Under a system combining fees and allocated quotas, the cost to users wouldalso be the same as either of these systems alone, and the transfers wouldaccrue to the United States Treasury. As a result, adding a regulatoryfee to an allocated quota system would not raise the price of CFCs andhalons to users but would remove any potential advantage for a producerto delay or reduce the supply of chemical substitutes.Commenters disagreed about whether EPA has legal authority to impose regulatoryfees. Several public interest groups contended that section 157(b) of theClean Air Act is sufficiently broad to permit EPA to use fees as a regulatorymethod. On the other hand, some chemical producers and a trade associationasserted that EPA could levy fees, if at all, only to recoup the administrativecost of the program; fees sufficiently high to raise prices of controlledsubstances enough to reduce demand were beyond EPA's authority. These commentersalso argued that to comply with the Clean Air Act's notice-and-commentrulemaking requirements, EPA would have to propose a more specific regulatoryfee program before it could promulgate such a program. The Agency believesthat the issues surrounding institution of a fees program deserve furtherattention, and in any event agrees that the December 14 NPRM did not provideadequate notice of what fee EPA would impose. The Agency has thereforedecided to conduct further rulemaking on fees, as explained in the ANPRalso published today. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Auctioned Rights </ITAG>Instead of granting production and consumption allowances to past producersand importers, EPA sought comment on the use of an auction as the meansof distributing allowances. Under this system, production and consumptionallowances would be sold at auction to the highest bidder. Anyone seekingto produce or import CFCs or halons could purchase allowances directlyat auction. To the extent chemical producers or distributors obtained allowancesat auction, user industries could rely on their existing channels of suppIyto provide these chemicaIs. Alternatively, user firms could also obtainallowances directly through an auction or purchase them through a secondarymarket. The December 14 NPRM discussed several key advantages (e.g., economic efficiency,transfers to the U.S. Treasury) and potential disadvantages (e.g., short-termspeculation and hoarding) of this approach. Chemical producers and a wide spectrum of CFC and halon user industriesvoiced opposition to an auction system. These commenters raised many ofthe concerns identified in the NPRM. They suggested that auctions wouldIead to speculation and hoarding, thus unnecessarily driving up the priceof CFCs and halons. Others commented that regulation by auction fell outsideEPA's legal authority. They also stated that this approach would be unfairto small businesses who would be unable to compete in an auction and wouldmake planning difficult for producers. In contrast, two automobile companies and three government agencies supportedthe use of auctions as an efficient and equitable regulatory system. Further,one government agency argued that speculation would increase rather thandecrease market stability. One agency and several public interest groupsalso contended that EPA has the legal authority to use an auction to achieveits regulatory goal. EPA believes that many of the concerns raised by industry would be shortterm. As a market price developed for CFCs and halons over time, any problemsassociated with hoarding and speculation would likely be diminished. However,because the next several years are critical in the transition to reducedreliance on CFCs and halons, EPA is concerned that these problems, if theydid occur in the short-term, could significantly hamper a smooth transitionaway from ozone-depleting substances. EPA also recognizes that, like fees,auctions are a novel regulatory approach and consequently raise issuesabout the Agency's authority to employ them. EPA is concerned that a successfulchallenge to this regulatory approach would disrupt United States' compliancewith the Montreal Protocol. In the ANRM also published in today's <T4>Federal Register</T4>, EPA seeks additional public comment on the desirabilityof shifting to an auction system and a possible design feature to addressthe concerns raised by commenters. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Engineering Controls and Product Bans </ITAG>EPA also requested public comment on the use of industry-specific engineeringcontrols_the Agency's traditional approach to pollution control_to implementthe Protocol. Thirty-two commenters stated that they opposed the use ofEPA-mandated engineering controls or bans. These commenters provided manyreasons against the use of this approach including: Reduced economic efficiency;increased administrative costs; inequitable treatment of industries (somewould be regulated while others would not); failure to provide an across-the-boardincentive for the development of chemical substitutes; and lack of assurancethat the control requirement's goal would be achieved (e.g., increasesin unregulated uses could offset required reductions). In contrast, several environmental groups and many foam blowers-supportedthe adoption of EPA-mandated engineering controls for industries with low-costcontrol options. These commenters argued that requiring such reductionswould ensure that low-cost measures would be taken in a timely manner which,in turn, would minimize CFC and halon price increases for all users. Severalfoam-blowers specifically supported engineering controls as a means ofensuring that other industries undertake cost-effective reductions availableto them instead of deciding to continue to use CFCs and pay the higherprices. Other members of the foam industry suggested that EPA establisha ``trigger event'' (such as an increase in CFC price beyond an establishedguideline) after which the Agency would mandate controls. In short, economic incentives as employed in an allocated quota systemmay not be enough to ensure the most cost-efficient control of CFCs andhalons possible. At the same time, EPA is still mindful of the drawbacksof using industry-specific engineering controls and product bans. It alsoacknowledges that the December 14 NPRM did not propose any particular controlor ban with enough specificity to permit the Agency to promulgate it inthis rulemaking. EPA intends to continually monitor progress made by each user industryto reduce its use of CFCs and halons. If the Agency determines that cost-effectivecontrols exist but are not being adopted in a timely manner, it may requiresuch actions. The ANPRM accompanying this final action discusses the specificcircumstances which could lead to EPA-mandated control requirements. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Other Systems </ITAG>Comments were also submitted on other regulatory options which were brieflymentioned in the December 14 NPRM. For example, several representativesof the auto industry supported a user (instead of producer) allocationsystem. Under this system, EPA would allocate allowances to the approximately5,000-10,000 customers who purchase CFCs directly from chemical producers.The commenters did not suggest how this mammoth allocation might be accomplished,only that EPA could assess an administrative fee to pay for the costs.EPA does not believe that a user allocation system would be feasible. Perhapsthe simplest approach to making user allocations would be for EPA to obtain1986 sales list from CFC producers and publish them for comment as thebasis for its allocation. However, based on its recent experience in developingallocations for less than 30 producers and importers, the time and resourcesrequired to process and verify claims would be much more than the Agencyhas available and could not be completed before the Protocol's likely effectivedate (January 1, 1989). Also, user allocations based on sales records wouldrequire release of information that would be claimed confidential.EPA considered allocating production rights to producers and auctioningconsumption rights to users. However, because producers would still maintaincontrol over production in this system, their market power would not besubstantially diminished. Users could seek to buy controlled substancesthat are imports instead of domestic production, but since foreign producersmust also live within the Protocol's limits (or have their imports bannedby the Parties), the availability of imports of controlled substances wouldbe restricted, leaving the market power of the domestic producers largelyintact. In any event, EPA does not want to create a system that encouragesgreater reliance on CFC and halon imports. <ITAG tagnum="81">6. Selection of the Allocated Quota System </ITAG>EPA has concluded that the allocated quota system is the appropriate methodfor implementing the Montreal Protocol for several reasons. One, by directlyregulating the supply of CFCs and halons, the allocated quota system isa straightforward method of ensuring that the requirements of the MontrealProtocol are met. Two, it is clearly lawful, in contrast to the auctionand regulatory fee systems which raise legal issues. Three, as a market-basedapproach, the allocated quota system is economically efficient. Four, itis relatively simple to administer, since the producers and importers subjectto the allocated quotas are small in number. While EPA recognizes thatan allocated quota system has the potential for windfall profits and theconcentration of market power in relatively few companies, it does notbelieve those disadvantages would prevent the system from bringing aboutthe reductions in ozone-depleting substances required by the Protocol.The Agency did not select regulatory fees as its implementing strategybecause fees alone would not ensure compliance with the Montreal Protocol.It is quite possible that more firms would decide to pay the fee and continueusing the CFCs and halons than should if the United States is to complywith the Protocol. Moreover, EPA's authority to administer a regulatoryfee program is uncertain. Like fees, engineering controls or bans could not ensure compliance withthe Protocol, since uses of CFCs and halons that are left unregulated couldcontinue to grow, thereby offsetting reductions in the regulated uses.Engineering controls or bans are also difficult to administer consideringthat thousands of firms use CFCs and halons. The auction approach, like other market-based programs, is economicallyefficient. However, commenters expressed concern that auctions, at leastinitially, would create large uncertainties about price and availabilityand could lead to speculation and short term hoarding of permits duringthe auction process. Further, legal questions exist about EPA's statutoryauthority to implement an auction system. However, because auctions area market-based system which, if, adopted, would ensure compliance withthe Montreal Protocol and shift some of the windfalls from the producersto the United States Treasury, EPA is seeking additional public commentin the ANPR on the desirability of shifting to this approach. EPA has selected the allocated quota system rather than other strategies,given the allocated quota system's capability of implementing the MontrealProtocol in an economically efficient, low cost manner and the legal andother concerns associated with other systems. However, EPA recognizes thatthe use of an allocated quota system standing alone could result in substantialwindfalls to a small number of CFC and halon producers which could createan economic incentive for these firms to delay the introduction of chemicalsubstitutes. Because of this concern, EPA is continuing to examine several alternativesto the use of an allocated quota system alone. In the advance notice ofproposed rulemaking (ANPRM) which is also published in today's <T4>Federal Register</T4>. EPA describes and seeks comment on supplementingallocated quotas with a regulatory fee to reduce windfall profits and/orwith engineering controls or bans on specific uses of CFCs and halons toensure that low cost reductions are made in a timely manner. The ANPRMalso describes and seeks comment on placing a time limit on the use ofallocated quotas and shifting to an allocation system based on auctions.D. Design of Allocated Quota System In response to comments on both its December 14 and May 24 NPRMs, EPA hasrevised several aspects of its allocated quotas system. The following paragraphsexplain the operative sections of the rule and highlight any changes fromthe proposed rule and the rationale for such changes. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Effective Date (andSection; 82.2) </ITAG>The December 14 NPRM stated that the rule would take effect when the MontrealProtocol entered into force. As noted above, the Protocol will enter intoforce on January 1, 1989, provided that at least 11 instruments of ratification,acceptance, approval of the Protocol or accession thereto have been depositedby Nations or regional economic integration organizations representingat least two-thirds of estimated global consumption of the controlled substances.If this condition has not been fulfilled by January 1, 1989, the Protocolwill enter into force on the 90th day following the date on which the conditionshave been fulfilled. (The Protocol also requires that the Vienna Conventionfirst enter into force; the conditions for that agreement to take effecthave recently been fulfilled, so that it will enter into force before January1, 1989.) Several commenters stated that the rule should not in any way be contingenton the Protocol. Moreover, because firms might increase production andstockpile controlled substances prior to January 1, 1989, the regulationsshould go into effect immediately upon promulgation. EPA does not believe that firms will stockpile significant quantities ofcontrolled substances before the rule goes into effect because storagefacilities are limited and profit margins in the near term are not likelyto make expanding storage economically attractive at this time. In anyevent, EPA believes that by holding off domestic implementation of theProtocol until it enters into force, the United States will be in a betterposition to encourage other key nations to ratify the agreement. There is no question that broad international observance of the Protocol'scontrol requirements is necessary to safeguard the ozone layer. Any reductionsthe United States could accomplish on its own by implementing the Protocol'srequirements before the Protocol enters into force would be small comparedto the protection offered by a ratified Protocol. (Although the UnitedStates now accounts for about 30 percent of global consumption of controlledsubstances, if only this nation and a few others limit future consumption,other nations would remain free to <T3>increase </T3>their consumption, making the United States contributionto control increasingly less significant). At the same time, United States'implementation might suggest to more reluctant nations that they need notundertake the required controls right away. EPA thus considers it prudentto stay domestic implementation of the Protocol until it enters into force.EPA remains optimistic that the conditions for entry into force will besatisfied by the January 1, 1989 target date. Governments throughout Europe,and in Australia, Japan and the Soviet Union are well along in their ownprocess of ratification. Recently, the Administrator of EPA sent a letterto his counterparts in other nations urging their speedy ratification ofthe Convention and Protocol. EPA intends to continue to closely monitorprogress toward ratification. If the Agency at some future date determinesthat a delay is likely, it will reassess what, if any, action should betaken. In a change from the December proposal, EPA has made paragraph andSection;82.13(f)(1) of its rule effective as of September 12, 1988. This requirementrelates to the method by which EPA will measure production of CFCs andhalons, and requires producers to inform the Agency of their current measurementtechniques. EPA needs this information even before the Protocol's targeteffective date in order to have enough time to prepare compliance monitoringguidelines before the likely date of the first control period, July l,1989. If EPA did not obtain this information until after the Protocol enteredinto force, it could not ensure compliance with the freeze requirement.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Definitions (andSection; 82.3) </ITAG>EPA received comments on many of its definitions both from respondentsto its data collection rule (andSection; 82.20) and from commenters on itsDecember 14 NPRM. The Agency sought to clarify several of its definitions(e.g., controlled substance, production, importer and exporter) in itsMay 24 supplementary proposal. This section discusses the key definitionsand summarizes comments received on the two NPRMs and the resulting changesin the final rule. <T3>a. Control Periods. </T3>In its December 14 NPRM, EPA defined controlperiods as those periods during which the prohibitions under andSection;82.4 (limits on production and imports) would apply. It reserved the actualdates of the control periods for future determination, because the timingof the first control period depends on the date of the Protocol's entryinto force. EPA must therefore wait until that date is known before itcan publish in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>the exact dates for every control period. EPA sought comment on a further complication in determining control periods.The Protocol specifies 12-month control periods for all three steps inthe Group I (i.e., CFCs) reduction schedule (i.e., freeze, 20 and 50 percentreductions). While the Protocol provides that the second step will beginon July 1, 1993, it makes timing of the first step contingent on when theProtocol enters into force. If the Protocol enters into force on January1, 1989, then the freeze will go into effect on July l, 1989, and eachcontrol period thereafter would last for 12 months without any overlapbetween step 1 (freeze) and step 2 (20 percent reduction). However, ifthe Protocol enters into force on any date other than January 1, 1989,then there would be overlapping control periods unless the last controlperiod of the freeze is shortened to less than 12-months. In its December 14 NPRM, EPA stated that it intended to handle this potentialoverlap, if it arose, by shortening the last control period in the freezestage so that no overlap occurred and prorating annual allocations forthat truncated control period. EPA received one comment on this issue from a chemical producer which statedthat any control period less than a year could prove disruptive becauseof the seasonal demand for CFCs. The commenter explained that CFC productionincreases dramatically during summer months because of higher demand forCFC-12 and-11 as a coolant. A shortened control period with a proratedallocation would prove economically disruptive if it coincided with thisperiod of peak demand. It suggested that EPA should define overlappingcontrol periods with the last freeze control period running into the firstcontrol period of the 20 percent reduction stage. EPA proposed to define the control periods so that no overlap would occurin part because it believed that the drafters of the Protocol did not intendcontrol periods to overlaps. Evidence of this intent is the fact that nooverlap will occur if the Protocol enters into force on the target dateand that the latter two control periods are defined as consecutive. However,EPA recognizes that the Protocol does define all control periods as lasting12 months, and that a control period of less than a year could disruptcompanies' production plans. The Agency has thus decided to define controlperiods as overlapping between the freeze and 20 percent reduction stagesif the Protocol enters into force on a date other than January 1. Shouldthe Protocol parties decide on a different approach to control periods,however, EPA will change its definition accordingly. <T3>b. Controlled substances. </T3>Consistent with the Montreal Protocol,EPA initially proposed defining this term as ``any substance listed inAppendix A to this Part, whether existing alone or in a mixture, but excludingany such substance or mixture that is in a manufactured product other thana container used for the transportation or storage of the substance listed.''A number of firms that responded to EPA's data collection rule (andSection;82.20) found this definition confusing, and as a result, EPA included inits May 24 supplemental proposal further clarification. This clarificationattempted to better distinguish ``bulk'' CFCs or halons from CFCs or halonscontained in products; the Protocol drafters and EPA intended that onlybulk CFCs and halons be subject to the freeze and reduction requirements.For example, while CFCs contained in a refrigerator are clearly not coveredby the definition of controlled substances, it is less clear whether CFCscontained in small cans used to refill a car air conditioner would be consideredin bulk form and thus a controlled substance or contained in a productand thus not a controlled substance. Technical experts called together by UNEP to discuss implementation ofthe Protocol (Nairobi, January 1988) recommended that the Protocol's definitionbe clarified as follows: ``Any amount of a [listed] substance or a mixtureof [listed] substances which is not part of a use system containing thesubstance is a controlled substance and not a product containing a controlledsubstance [for the purpose of the Protocol]. If a [listed] substance ormixture must first be transferred from a bulk container to another container,vessel or piece of equipment in order to realize its intended use, thefirst container is in fact utilized only for storage and/or transport andthe [listed] substance is considered [in] bulk [form or a controlled substance]and not a product''. Under this modified definition, for example, CFCsin small cans used to refill refrigerators and car air conditioners wouldclearly be in bulk form and therefore be counted as controlled substances.EPA concluded that this clarification captured the bulk-versus-productdistinction the Protocol drafters had sought to make, and proposed in itsMay 24 supplemental notice to add the clarification to the rule's definition.Comments on that notice supported the proposed clarification, and it hasbeen incorporated into the final rule. EPA also addressed the need for ``rules of thumb'' in determining whetheran ozone-depleting substance was in bulk form and thus a controlled substance.In reviewing the data submitted for purposes of calculating company-specificallocations, the Agency found that importers and exporters of CFC-113 insmall containers did not always know the use to which the containers wereultimately put. EPA developed a ``one gallon rule'' to decide whether thereported CFC-113 was a controlled substance or not if the use of the containercould not be determined; if the container of CFC-113 was under one gallonin size, the Agency assumed it was used for direct cleaning and thus nota controlled substance. EPA stated that for purposes of implementing theproposed rule, it would use the one gallon rule where the use of a containerof CFC-113 was not known, and suggested that it might develop other rulesof thumb as circumstances warranted.Commenters supported EPA's rule of thumb for CFC-113 and suggested thatit be extended to metric containers equivalent to one gallon in size andto other chemicals. EPA agrees that its one gallon rule should apply tocontainers that are approximately 4 liters in size. It also agrees thatthe rule should be applied to small containers of controlled substancesother than CFC-113, but also only when the use to which those containerswill be put cannot be determined. As several commenters recommended, EPA intends to establish a process bywhich industry could seek further clarification of the definition as newambiguities arise and by which the Agency would develop any other rulesof thumb. <T3>c. Export/Import. </T3>The December 14 NPRM and final rule (andSection;82.20) defined export as ``the transport of controlled substances fromwithin the United States or its territories to persons or countries outsidethe United States.'' Several respondents raised issues concerning specificapplications of that definition. Several questioned whether shipments ofcontrolled substances to United States military bases abroad should becounted as exports. Others questioned whether controlled substances usedon-board ships were to be considered exports. As part of its May 24 NPRM, EPA proposed that in both cases the controlledsubstances <T3>not </T3>be considered exports. In the case of shipments to UnitedStates military bases abroad, the United States is clearly the beneficiaryof the controlled substances and should count them toward its consumptionlimit. In both cases, it is unlikely that any other nation would claimthem as imports. As a result, failure to include them as part of UnitedStates consumption would likely result in undermining the effectivenessof the Montreal Protocol by allowing some subset of controlled substancesto remain unclaimed and unreported by any nation as consumption. Commentson this provision generally supported the clarification proposed on May24. For the reasons mentioned above, EPA has revised the definition of exportsto specifically exclude shipments to United States military bases and toships for on-board use. In its May 24 supplemental proposal, EPA also discussed the potential exportand import of recycled or used controlled substances. EPA explained thatthe Nairobi technical experts group had suggested that production be definedin the Protocol to exclude recycled substances but that export and importbe defined to include them. The Agency noted that its definition of productionalready excluded recycled controlled substances, and described how itsconsumption allowances would allow import of used controlled substancesand export of recycled substances. Several commenters agreed that recycled and used controlled substancesshould be included in the definition of export and import. They noted,however, that not all used substances could be recycled, so that consumptionallowances expended to import used substances would not be completely replacedby consumption allowances granted upon proof of export of the recycledused substances. They accordingly recommended that consumption allowancesbe required only for that portion of used substances that could be recycled.Another commenter instead argued that agreements between nations to recyclewould be facilitated if the Agency's rule did not cover used or recycledcontrolled substances at all. Since preparing the May 24 supplemental proposal, EPA has realized thatdefining export in its rule to include recycled <T3>and</T3> virgin controlled substances would risk United States noncompliancewith the Protocol. Since the Agency's rule defines production to excluderecycled controlled substances, firms could recycle those substances withoutexpending production and consumption allowances. However, if export isdefined to include recycled substances, on exporting the recycled substancesfirms would receive authorization to convert potential production allowancesand consumption allowances in the amount of the recycled substances exported.Thus, as a result of exporting recycled substances for which no productionand consumption allowances were expended, firms would realize a net increasein production allowances (up to the 10 or 15 percent limit on potentialproduction allowances) and consumption allowances. They could then usethese additional allowances to produce or import and <T3>sell domestically </T3>controlled substances in excess of the amountthe initial allocations authorized. If this occurred, the United States would exceed its limits under the Protocol.EPA's rule allocates consumption allowances equal to United States 1986consumption and allows firms to obtain additional consumption allowancesonly upon proof of export, so that total available consumption allowancesnever exceed the United States consumption limit under the Protocol. Iffirms could recycle controlled substances without expending productionand consumption allowances, but obtain production and consumption allowancesupon exporting the recycled substances, total consumption allowances wouldexceed the United States limit. EPA cannot permit this and still complywith the Protocol, so it has revised the definition of export to make clearthat only virgin production is covered by that term. In addition, it hasrevised the provisions governing the availability of consumption and productionallowances to specify that only exports of virgin production will entitlea person to additional allowances. Firms can continue to export recycledor used controlled substances, but will not receive additional consumptionor authorization to convert potential production allowances. At the same time, EPA believes that imports must be defined to includeboth virgin and recycled or used chemicals. The potential would otherwiseexist for virgin controlled substances to be mislabelled as recycled orused chemicals so that they could be imported without consumption allowances.To ensure that the United States does not exceed its consumption limitby inadvertently importing virgin production that has been labelled recycled,the definition of import in EPA's rule must be and has been revised toinclude both types of production. The Agency realizes that by definingimport and export differently in this way, the rule no longer allows producersto recoup consumption allowances expended to import used controlled substancesfor recycling with allowances granted upon export of the recycled substances.Depending on how this issue is addressed by the Protocol Parties, EPA willconsider revising its rule so as to provide consumption allowances forexport of recycled substances without risking United States noncompliancewith the Protocol. <T3>d. Exporter. </T3>The December 14 NPRM did not contain a definitionof exporter, but simply referred to an exporter as the person who exportedthe controlled substance (proposed andSection; 82.13(g)). The December 14final action defined exporter also in terms of the movement of controlledsubstances from within the United States to outside the country (andSection;82.20(a)(3)). The lack of a specific definition created considerable confusion over whoshould be considered the exporter. Clearly defining the exporter is importantfor determining both who must comply with the final rule's reporting requirements(andSection; 82.13) and who will obtain upon proof of export consumptionallowances and authorization to convert potential production allowancesto production allowances (andSection;andSection; 82.10 and 82.11).In its May 24 supplemental NPRM, the Agency proposed to define exporteras the person or company that enters into a contract to sell controlledsubstances to a person or company located outside the United States foruse outside the United States. EPA believed the persons meeting this definitionwould likely have knowledge of the Agency's reporting requirements andincentive to seek the additional allowances available upon proof of exports.While commenters generally supported this approach, one chemical companypointed out that this definition fails to cover transactions between subsidiariesof multinational corporations that do not entail contracts of sale. Takingthis comment into consideration, the Agency has modified its definitionof exporter to ``the person who contracts to sell controlled substancesfor export or transfers controlled substances to his affiliate in anothercountry.'' <T3>e. Importer. </T3>EPA did not directly define importer in either theDecember 14 NPRM or the final rule published on December 14. Instead, inthe final rule EPA referred to importers as ``persons who transported thechemicals listed in andSection; 82.20(b) from outside the United States orits territories to persons within the United States or its territories.''The December 14 NPRM also referred to an importer as ``any person who importscontrolled substances'' (andSection; 82.13(f)). Public response to both of these notices suggested that it was not clearwho EPA considered to be the importer. The definition of importer is importantbecause it determines who receives the initial allocation of consumptionrights (andSection; 82.6), who is required to submit reports to EPA (andSection;82.13(f), and who must hold consumption rights to authorize the importationof controlled substances (andSection; 82.4). In its May 24 supplementary proposal, EPA proposed to define importer forthe purpose of allocating consumption rights as ``the first United Statesowner who is a supplier to or a member of the domestic industry that usesthe controlled chemicals.'' EPA stated that this definition would generallyresult in consumption rights being allocated to the ``importer of record''on United States Customs documents (the party responsible for obtaininga shipment's legal entry in the United States). However, in the few caseswhere the importer of record was a transfer or shipping agent and not thefirst United States' owner, the definition would mean that the first UnitedStates purchaser of the imports who was a member of the producer or userindustry would receive the consumption rights allocation. EPA consideredthis definition appropriate not only because it would result in consumptionrights being allocated in every case to members of the CFC and halon produceror user industries, but because it also provided a reasonable and rationalbasis for resolving which of two parties claiming 1986 imports should receivethe applicable consumption allowances. During the public comment period for the May 24 proposal, EPA identifiedanother competing claim that was different from those it had consideredin developing the proposed definition of importer. This claim involved,on the one hand, the shipments' importer of record which is a member ofthe domestic user industry and, on the other, the shipments' first UnitedStates owner (based on submitted invoices) which is a foreign producer'ssubsidiary. In the case of the competing claims discussed in the May 24NPRM, application of the proposed definition always resulted in the claimbeing awarded to the importer of record, unless the importer of recordwas not a supplier to or member of the domestic user industry. However,in the case of the recently identified competing claim, the proposed definitionwould identify the foreign producer's subsidiary even though it was <T3>not</T3> the importer of record. EPA had explained in the May 24 NPRM that it preferred its proposed definitionin part because it would result in the importer of record being awardedthe claim except where a mere shipping agent was the importer of record.The Agency thought this result appropriate because the importer of recordwas legally responsible for obtaining the shipment's entry into the UnitedStates, and because in most cases shipments claimed by importers of recordwere<T3> not</T3> also claimed by anyone else. On further reflection, EPA has concluded that its proposed definition reasonablyresolves competing claims even though in the case described above, itsapplication will result in a claim being awarded to a supplier to the domesticuser industry that is <T3>not</T3> an importer of record. Given the many different ways importtransactions can be configured, defining importer as the person who paidthe foreign producer for the shipment (i.e., ``the first United Statesowner'') is both simple and logical. The first United States owner canin every case be considered to have ``caused'' the import since it paidthe foreign producer for the shipment. To define the importer as the UnitedStates firm that placed the order with the foreign producer, as some commenterssuggest, would extend the chain of causality which could arguably be extendedfurther. For example, the customers of that United States firm could alsoargue that they ``caused'' the import by creating the demand. EPA has alsocome to appreciate that what firm is the importer of record may often bea matter of proximity to ports and thus an accident of convenience, orof a business relationship independent of the sale of the control substances.Where two firms claimed to be the ``first United States owner,'' EPA resolvedthe dispute in favor of the firm that paid the foreign producer for theimported chemicals, as indicated by submitted invoices. One commenter arguedthat payment to the foreign producer was not dispositive of ownership,and that the nature of the relationship between the producer and its UnitedStates subsidiary is also relevant. It specifically recommended that ifthe two firms are principal and agent or consignor and consignee, EPA shouldnot consider the subsidiary an owner even if it paid its parent companyfor the shipment. While the commenter's suggested application of the ``first United Statesowner'' definition might be plausible, EPA notes that it has discretionin applying terms of its own creation. The Agency chose the ``first UnitedStates owner'' definition in part because of its administrative simplicity.It likewise applied that definition in a straightforward manner_who paidthe foreign producer_to preserve the advantage of simplicity. The commenter'ssuggested application would have required EPA to determine the legal relationshipbetween firms and the significance of that relationship for the conceptof ``ownership,'' and undertaking which the Agency has neither the timenor resources to complete. EPA believes its application of its definitionis reasonable under the circumstances. In defining importer for allocation purposes and applying that definition,EPA is faced with assigning valuable allowances based on actions takenin the past with no awareness of their future significance. Any choicethe Agency makes will thus seem inequitable to the firms whose claims arerejected in EPA's resolution of competing claims. EPA considered dividingclaims between competing firms, but rejected this approach because therewas no assurance that this approach would satisfy the firms involved. Moreover,the many firms that could have, but did not, submit competing claims wouldlikely assert that, in light of an Agency decision to divide up competingclaims, they should have the opportunity to submit those claims now. The Agency also rejected one commenter's request that it conduct evidentiaryhearings to determine who ``most'' caused an import to occur. First, EPAalready has the information such hearings would be likely to provide. Second,what weight to give what factors (e.g., who placed the order with whom,who supplied what aspects of the transportation) would entail only morelinedrawing that could be second-guessed any number of ways. Third, conductingsuch hearings would be administratively burdensome and, by delaying completionof the rule, could jeopardize the United States' ability to comply withthe Protocol.The Agency regrets that it could not honor all firms' import claims. However,the competing claims left EPA with no practical choice but to define importerin a manner that would identify only one firm. It believes its proposeddefinition is reasonable for the reasons given above, and has thus adoptedthat definition for purposes of allocating consumption allowances basedon 1986 imports. In the May 24 NPRM, EPA also indicated that it was considering definingimporter differently for purposes of enforcing the rule's prohibition againstimporting controlled substances without consumption allowances. EPA expressedconcern that as an ongoing matter, it may be administratively burdensometo determine who is the first United States owner and who is a supplier.It stated that requiring a shipment's importer of record to hold the consumptionallowances authorizing the shipment would be easier to implement, and thatpurchasers of those shipments would be likely to ensure that the importerof record held the necessary consumption allowances. Several commenters indicated that they would prefer that the first UnitedStates owner definition used for allocating consumption allowances alsobe used to determine who should hold consumption allowances authorizingan import shipment. However, one of these commenters suggested that theimporter of record, where different from the first United States owner,also be required to report the shipment. Notwithstanding these comments, EPA still favors defining importer as theimporter of record for purposes of enforcing the rule's requirements. Thatdefinition avoids the potential for EPA becoming entangled in disputesbetween companies as to who is the first United States owner and who isa supplier to the user industry. It also avoids the need to require boththe first United States owner <T3>and </T3>the importer of record to report the shipment. With advanceknowledge of this definition, firms can decide wether they should be theimporters of record for future shipments or should make arrangements withother companies to ensure that shipments are covered by the necessary consumptionallowances. EPA notes that the final rule defines importer only as the importer ofrecord. Since the rule specifies firms' consumption allocations, thereis no need for the definition of importer underlying those allocations(i.e., the first United States  owner) to appear in the rule. The importerof record definition is included in the rule because it determines whois subject to the rule's prohibition against importing controlled substanceswithout consumption allowances. <T3>f. Production. </T3>The December 14 NPRM defined this term as ``themanufacture of a controlled substance from any raw material or feedstockchemical; however, production does not include the manufacture of controlledsubstances that are used and entirely consumed in the production of otherchemicals.'' The public comments on the December 14 NPRM raised several issues relatedto this definition. In addition, at the Nairobi meeting of technical experts,other nations suggested modifying the definition of production in the MontrealProtocol (``the amount of controlled substances produced minus the amountdestroyed by technologies to be approved by the parties'') so that reprocessedor recycled controlled substances would not be counted as part of a Party'sproduction. The technical experts group agreed to suggest modifying thedefinition in the Protocol to state that production equals total production,including reprocessed and virgin chemicals, minus purchases of controlledsubstances for purposes of recycling. This definition would permit recycledcontrolled substances from one nation to be mixed with virgin productionfrom another nation without the latter nation having to count the recycledportion as part of its production. EPA explained in its May 24 supplemental NPRM that its definition of production,which is limited to manufacture from raw materials or feedstock chemicals,already excludes the portion of any output that results from reprocessedcontrolled substances. As a result, EPA proposed not to alter this aspectof its definition of production and commenters agreed that no alterationwas necessary. The Agency has thus adopted the definition of productionproposed in its December 14 NPRM. Another issue related to the definition of production concerns the definition'sexclusion of ``controlled substances that are used and entirely consumedin the production of other chemicals.'' In its May 24 supplemental NPRM,EPA discussed the need to clarify limits on the use of this exclusion.Specifically, the Agency proposed that, because of potential administrativeburdens and problems of verification, this exclusion would be limited totransformation of controlled substances that are produced and transformedby the same company. Thus, one company could not buy a controlled substancefrom another company and receive credit against its production by transformingthat controlled substance. Nor could a company in the United States receivecredit for transformation of a controlled substance produced in anothercountry. EPA proposed to modify its definition of production to specificallyinclude this limitation. Four chemical companies commented that such restrictions would unduly limitthe use of controlled substances as chemical feedstocks. They suggestedthat the producing and transforming firms could report and document anysuch transformations, and  that the feedstock producers should receivecredits. One commenter also argued that the proposed limitation would preventcompanies that are not producers from entering into a business that usescontrolled substances as feedstock. The Agency notes that the proposed limitation would not prevent companiesthat do not produce feedstocks from purchasing feedstocks from producers.Also, it is not clear to EPA that small companies would be disadvantagedin competing against fully integrated companies, since their ability topurchase feedstocks will depend on future prices of controlled substancesand the availability of product and chemical substitutes. In any event, EPA believes that granting production credits for feedstocktransformation involving two companies raises several difficult issuesthat require further study. One issue is which company should receive theproduction credit_the company which produced the feedstock or the companywhich transformed it. Similarly, the group of technical advisors to theProtocol could not agree on which country should be granted productioncredits in the case of feedstocks traded between countries. There are also documentation issues. If the company transforming the feedstockis not the company receiving the credits, the transforming company wouldseem to have little incentive in maintaining accurate records. More generally,quantifying and verifying the amount of feedstock transformed and trackingthe transfer and use of transformation credits would add layers of complexityto the Agency's compliance monitoring task.These issues are even more difficult to resolve where transformations involvecontrolled substances produced in another country. Because of these concerns,EPA has decided to initially limit credit to production and transformationof feedstocks by the same company and will evaluate the possibility ofexpanding this provision in the future. A third issue related to the definition of production involves EPA's decisionin the December NPRM (see footnote 6 on page 47501) not to initially provideproduction credit for the destruction of controlled substances as the MontrealProtocol permits. (Under the Protocol, CFCs and halons destroyed by technologiesto be approved by the Parties would not be counted as production). EPAstated that since no destruction technologies had yet been approved bythe Parties it was deferring implementation of this provision, but that``EPA intends to work closely with industry in the future to review existingand new destruction technologies and, if appropriate, submit these technologiesto the Parties for their approval.'' Six chemical producers and users urged EPA to define production to reflectthis destruction credit provision in its final rule as a means of encouragingthe rapid development and implementation of destruction technologies. EPAagrees that efforts should be made to further development of destructiontechnologies. However, regardless of what it now includes in the rule,EPA will have to modify the rule to specify any destruction technologiesonce they are approved by the Parties, as well as reporting and recordkeepingrequirements adequate to monitor their implementation. Thus, the Agencybelieves that modifying its definition of production when the Parties approvetechnology will be more efficient. In waiting to do so, the Agency willalso benefit from the experience gained under the rule until that time.Firms with potential destruction technologies are encouraged to expeditiouslydevelop these technologies and to work with EPA to gain their approvalby the Parties. EPA fully intends to modify its rule to allow for the grantof production credits as soon as destruction technologies are approved.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Prohibitions (andSection; 82.4) </ITAG>The prohibitions section of the rule stipulates that no person may producecontrolled substances at any time during any control period in excess ofthe amount of unexpended production allowances held by that person at thattime, and that no person may produce or import controlled substances atany time during any control period in excess of the amount of unexpendedconsumption allowances held by that person at that time. It further specifiesthat both valid unexpended production and consumption allowances are requiredfor production, while only valid unexpended consumption allowances arenecessary for the importation of controlled substances. The proposed rule specified that a person must ``own'' or ``hold'' productionand consumption allowances to produce or import controlled substances.The final rule instead requires that allowances ``held by that person underthe authority of this Part'' be sufficient to cover that person's productionor import. EPA made this change to clarify its intention to only creditpersons with production and consumption allowances that the Agency's recordsshow they possess or that the person has properly obtained by the meansspecified in the regulations. The Agency also sought to avoid having todetermine who has legal ownership of allowances or becoming entangled inownership disputes. As explained in the December 14 NPRM, the use of both consumption and productionallowances are required to ensure compliance with the consumption and productionlimits of the Montreal Protocol. One commenter suggested that EPA limitonly production and not consumption, but if EPA does not limit importsas well as production, the United States could exceed the Protocol's limitson consumption, which is defined as production plus imports minus exports.EPA also sought through the use of consumption and production allowancesto provide industry with the maximum flexibility available under the termsof the Protocol. EPA received several comments on its proposed penalty which defined a violationin terms of ``every kilogram'' of production or importation in excess ofunexpended production or consumption allowances. As explained in the December14 NPRM, under section 113(b) of the Clean Air Act, penalties of up to$25,000 per day per violation can be assessed. Several chemical producers generally believed that a penalty of $25,000for each kilogram was excessive and impractical. They stated that giventhe nature of the process used to produce these chemicals, they cannotcontrol or even measure production output to the level of a kilogram. Onecommenter stated that production output is measured based on storage inlarge holding tanks and therefore can only be measured with an accuracyof 1-2 percent. They argued that they should not be accountable for exceedanceswhich they believed they could not accurately measure. In addition, thesecommenters suggested that EPA modify its rule to allow production overrunsin one year to be compensated by a reduction in allocated allowances inthe following year. A public interest group, on the other hand, supportedEPA's proposed definition of a violation, stating that it would preventsignificant ``leakages'' of controlled substances in excess of productionand consumption limits. In the time since its December NPRM, EPA has conducted several site visitsto review the level of accuracy that producers can achieve in their productioncontrol and measurement, and the recordkeeping procedures they currentlyemploy. The Agency recognizes that controlling the exact quantity of productionis difficult and that measuring large quantities of controlled substancesis subject to a small degree of error. However, the Montreal Protocol requiresthat Parties live within specified limits, and EPA has apportioned allowancesthat total to those limits. Were the Agency to define violations in unitsof 1,000 kilograms, for example, it would effectively license firms toexceed their limits by 999 kilograms. Were firms to take advantage of thisflexibility, the United States would find itself in violation of the Protocol.Thus, EPA has adopted the provision that every kilogram of production orimport in excess of valid unexpended production or consumption allowancesis a separate violation of the rule. Even though EPA has defined violation in terms of one kilogram, the Agencydoes not intend to necessarily seek the maximum statutory penalty for eachviolation. EPA intends to develop and administer a penalty policy thatwill effectively deter noncompliance, while at the same time recognizingthat production of controlled substances cannot always be precisely controlledor measured. (The Agency notes that importers typically purchase controlledsubstances in kilogram units, so that they should be able to more preciselyaccount for their shipments.) In developing that policy, EPA will review potential price increases ofcontrolled substances and estimate the penalty necessary to deter exceedences.The Agency will also consider the practical degrees of control in currentproduction processes, the accuracy of measurements and industry recordkeepingin general, and the ability of EPA to monitor compliance. In assessingactual penalties, EPA will take into account these factors as well as themagnitude of the exceedence and the types of internal controls used bythe firm. EPA has also decided not to alter its prohibition provisions to allow producersand importers to exceed their allowances in one control period in exchangefor a reduction in their allowances the next. The Montreal Protocol definescontrol periods in terms of 12 months and requires that controls be achievedduring the 12-month period. Thus, the Protocol does not provide for theflexibility the producers seek, and EPA may not provide it without riskingUnited States' noncompliance with the Protocol.Section 82.4(d) implements the provision in the Montreal Protocol prohibitingParties from importing controlled substances from nations not Party toor not complying with the Protocol beginning one year after the Protocolenters into force. No comments on this provision were submitted, but EPArequested and received comments on other possible trade provisions. Specifically,EPA requested comment on the desirability of moving forward in time implementationof the Protocol's provisions restricting the importation of products containingor produced with controlled substances from non-Parties. Eight commenters(chemical producers, user industries and public interest groups) urgedEPA to take such action. However, most commenters generally urged EPA notto take action beyond that required by the Montreal Protocol, arguing thatsuch action would be economically disruptive without improving environmentalprotection. EPA does not believe that implementing trade prohibitions in tandem withthe Protocol will adversely affect United States industry's ability tocompete with companies from countries not Party to the Protocol in theearly years following the agreement's entry into force. CFC and halon pricesare not likely to increase significantly in the early years of the Protocolif firms act in a timely manner to employ cost-effective reductions. Moreover,most of EPA's major trading partners (e.g., Japan, Canada, Mexico, WesternEuropean nations) are likely to become Parties to the Protocol. However,EPA will continue to monitor this situation and may determine in the futurethat early implementation of trade restrictions against non-Parties iswarranted. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Apportionment of Baseline Production Allowances (andSection; 82.5)</ITAG>This section of the rule sets forth companies' baseline production allowancesand the basis for calculating them. To determine these allowances, EPAin its December 14 final rule required producers of controlled substancesto submit data documenting their production levels in 1986, the baselineyear specified by the Protocol. After reviewing these data submissionsfor completeness and accuracy, EPA published a supplemental proposal onMay 24 containing proposed company-specific allocations and clarifyingthe definition of relevant terms. EPA proposed to calculate each producer's baseline allowances in threesteps. First, consistent with the rule's definition of production, theproducer's 1986 production level of each controlled chemical was reducedby the amount of that chemical the producer used in 1986 to make othercontrolled substances. Second, the producer's adjusted production of eachcontrolled chemical from raw materials or feedstocks was multiplied bythat chemicals' ozone depletion weight as set forth in Appendix A of theDecember 14 proposal to arrive at a ``calculated level'' of production.Finally, the resulting calculated levels were added together for GroupI chemicals and for Group II chemicals. Firms that produced chemicals inboth Group I and Group II were thus apportioned separate production allowancesfor Group I and Group II chemicals. EPA received comments from one chemical producer on its December 14 NPRMopposing its proposed basis for calculating baseline production allowances.This producer suggested that, in the case of halons, EPA should use a 1987base year to more accurately reflect current free market conditions. Italso suggested that allocations for halons should be based only on ``non-government''business to avoid providing a competitive advantage to past vendors whosold to the federal government, the single largest consumer of these chemicals.The Agency does not agree with either comment. The Protocol specifies 1986as the baseline year. EPA could only use a different year as a baselineand ensure compliance with the Protocol if it prorated 1987-based allowancesso that they do not total to more than 1986 United States' production.To do this would entail EPA collecting and reviewing data for both 1986and 1987, and otherwise complicate a process the Agency already found cumbersome.Moreover, use of 1986 as the baseline year is more equitable because firmsmay have changed their market behavior in 1987 in response to on-goingProtocol negotiations. EPA also sees no compelling reason to distinguishpast sales to the government (or any other large users) from any otherpast sales. As EPA defined and proposed it, the allocated quota systemsimply grandfathers past market shares. Since the rule permits allowancesto be transferred, however, market shares may still change in the future.In comments on the May 24 NPRM, firms generally agreed with their proposedproduction allowances. EPA reviewed the comments and is including finalallocations in the final rule. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Apportionment of Baseline Consumption Allowances (andSection; 82.6)</ITAG>To implement the Protocol's limits on consumption (defined as productionplus imports minus exports), the calculation of baseline consumption allowancesrequires reducing the sum of production and imports by exports. Complicationsarise in attributing exports to producers and importers. In all other respects,consumption allowances are calculated in the same manner as productionallowances. In the December NPRM, EPA proposed to simply allocate exports to producersin proportion to their 1986 market share of production, since producerswere responsible for most exports presumably in proportion to their shareof the production market. In response to public comments questioning theequity of this approach, EPA proposed in its May supplemental NPRM to calculateeach firm's consumption allowances by subtracting the amount of controlledsubstances that firm<T3> directly</T3> exported in 1986. Accordingly, importers as well asproducers would have their consumption allowances reduced to reflect theirdirect exports. Since not all exports could be traced to a producer orimporter, EPA also proposed to attribute the remaining exports to producersin proportion to their 1986 market share of production. In addition, EPAstated that because the final rule would contain the company-specific apportionments,it would omit from the final rule the explanation of how they were calculated.Several firms urged EPA to take additional steps to trace exports backto their original producer. EPA concludes that it would be impracticaland in many cases infeasible to undertake such an exercise. To verify claimsof consumption allowances, the Agency examined large volumes of supportingdocumentation and in some cases corrections were made to the claims. EPAbelieves that a similar verification process requiring supporting documentationwould be required to assign the unattributed exports to producers and importers.Further, EPA would have to obtain the exporter's proof of purchase froma producer or importer to assign these unattributed rights appropriately.Although providing the necessary documentation might be relatively easyfor some firms, for others it would be difficult and in some cases evenimpossible. Where exporters bought CFCs from multiple sources, adequatedocumentation to determine the sources of particular exports simply doesnot exist. Given how little time remains before the Protocol is due toenter into force and the infeasibility of tracing all exports, EPA hasdecided against attempting to further attribute currently unattributableexports. Two commenters complained that use of the proposed correction factor wouldunfairly penalize producers that had produced little or no controlled substancesfor direct or indirect export. They suggested that EPA allocate the unattributedexports in proportion to a firm's direct exports rather than production.EPA disagrees with this approach. The Agency does not believe that thereis any correspondence between a manufacturer's share in the direct exportmarket and that manufacturer's share of the non-producer exports sinceexporters could have purchased from any of the producers in the marketplace.The Agency also cannot be certain that exporters did not purchase any controlledsubstances from the producers who claim not to have contributed even indirectlyto the export market. To verify such claims, EPA would have to trace potentiallylong chains of sales and resales, which the Agency has neither the timenor resources to do. As a result, EPA believes that the apportionment ofunallocated exports based on production share is a more equitable approach.Another commenter noted that it exported a chemical it did not produceand thus argued that it should not have the export of that chemical subtractedfrom its consumption allowance. It likened its exports to those of exporterswho are neither producers nor importers and whose shipments have consequentlybeen placed in the unattributed exports pool for allocation to producersby means of the correction factor. EPA agrees with this commenter. In calculating consumption allowances,the Agency sought to attribute exported chemicals to those firms that wereresponsible for the production or import of the chemicals. In the caseof this commenter and two other firms that EPA identified based on informationsubmitted in response to the December 14 final rule, the Agency subtractedfrom their proposed consumption allowances exported chemicals of a typethey neither produced nor imported. EPA has thus placed those exports inthe unattributed export pool and modified producers' consumption allowancesaccordingly. As discussed above, the Agency has decided to require consumption allowancesfor import of used controlled substances for recycling. EPA thus considersit appropriate to allocate firms' consumption allowances in the amountof any 1986 import of used controlled substances, so that they may continueto engage in recycling without having to purchase consumption allowancesthat could otherwise be used to produce or import virgin production. EPAidentified one firm that imported used controlled substances in 1986 andhas increased that firm's consumption allowance accordingly. <ITAG tagnum="81">6. Grant and Phased Reduction of Baseline Production and ConsumptionAllowances for Group I Controlled Substances (andSection; 82.7) </ITAG>This section of the rule implements the Protocol's phased reduction ofCFCs (Group I controlled substances). It grants companies decreasing percentagesof their baseline production and consumption allowances in step with theProtocol's three-stage reduction schedule. Following entry into force ofthe Protocol, companies are granted 100 percent of their baseline allowancesfor the control periods during which the Protocol requires a freeze inproduction and consumption of Group I controlled substances. (As statedearlier, once EPA knows the date of entry into force, it will publish a<T4>Federal Register </T4>notice giving the dates of the control periodsfor the freeze and subsequent stages.) As of July 1, 1993, companies aregranted 80 percent of their baseline allowances for each control periodand as of July 1, 1998, 50 percent of their baseline allowances. As described earlier, should the Protocol not enter into force on January1, 1989, the first control period would not begin on July 1, 1989. In thatevent, EPA intends to implement the Protocol's 12-month control periodsby having overlapping periods during the transition from the freeze stageto the 20 percent reduction stage. EPA has accordingly modified the ruleto grant 100 percent of 1986 baseline levels for each of the control periodswhich ``begins'' before July 1, 1993, instead of ``ends'' before July 1,1993. The only effect of this change will be to allow the last 12 monthcontrol period of the freeze to continue beyond July 1, 1993, if necessary.Of course, firms will also have to meet the 20 percent reduction requirementfor the 12-month period beginning on July 1, 1993. One chemical producer raised an additional issue concerning the timingof control periods. While recognizing that EPA's regulation cannot accomplishthis goal, it suggested that the Protocol be modified to shift controlperiods to calendar years. EPA notes, however, that agreement on the timingof the staged reductions was reached only after considerable negotiationsand only just before the Protocol was signed. As a result, EPA stronglybelieves that, notwithstanding the minor inconvenience that may resultfrom the use of 12-month periods which are not coincident with the calendaryear, reopening this issue at this time is inappropriate. However, theissue of stringency and timing of controls will be reviewed by the Partiesunder Article 6 of the Protocol at which time this issue can be furtheraddressed. <ITAG tagnum="81">7. Grant and Freeze of Baseline Production and Consumption Allowancesfor Group II Controlled Substances (andSection; 82.8) </ITAG>This section implements the Protocol's freeze of the production and consumptionof halons (Group II controlled substances). It grants companies 100 percentof their baseline production and consumption allowances for the controlperiods specified in andSection; 82.3(f)(2). Section 82.3(f)(2) is reservedfor future determination by EPA, because the Protocol provides for thehalon freeze to begin on the first day of the thirty-seventh month followingthe Protocol's entry into force. Assuming the conditions required for entryinto force are satisfied by January 1, 1989, the restrictions on halonswould take effect on January 1, 1992. If entry into force is delayed, thefreeze on halons would also be delayed. EPA will publish the dates of controlperiods for Group II controlled substances soon after the date of entryinto force has been determined. <ITAG tagnum="81">8. Availability of Production Allowances in Addition to Baseline ProductionAllowances (andSection; 82.9) </ITAG>This section implements provisions in the Montreal Protocol which allowfor limited production (but not consumption) increases above limits describedabove. At each stage, the Protocol allows production levels during a controlperiod to exceed the limit by no more than ten percent (or 15 percent whenCFCs must be reduced by 50 percent) of the 1986 level. Such increases arepermitted ``only so as to satisfy the basic domestic needs of the Partiesoperating under Article 5 [special situation of developing countries] andfor the purposes of industrial rationalization between parties.'' Industrialrationalization is defined by the Protocol as ``the transfer of all ora portion of the calculated level of production of one Party to another,for the purposes of achieving economic efficiencies or responding to shortfallsin supply as result of plant closures.'' The Protocol also allows a Partyto exceed its production limit to the extent it reaches a binding agreementwith a Party which produced less than 25 kilotonnes of controlled substancesin 1986, if the ``25-kilotonne Party'' will reduce its production allowanceby the same amount. To enable producers to increase their production to the extent permittedby the Protocol, andSection; 82.9 grants to each firm receiving baselineproduction allowances under andSection;andSection; 82.5 and 82.6 ``potentialproduction allowances'' equalling 10 or 15 percent of their baseline allowancesdepending on the control period and group of controlled substances. Holdersof potential production allowances may then obtain EPA authorization toconvert them to production allowances under andSection; 82.11 by provingthey exported to Parties a calculated level of controlled substances equalto the amount of potential production allowances they want to convert,or under andSection; 82.12 by obtaining such authorization from another firmthat obtained the authorization under andSection; 82.11. In addition, andSection;82.9 permits anyone to produce controlled substances to the extent theyreceive a transfer of a 25-kilotonne Party's production allowance and theydemonstrate to EPA that the transfer is <T3>bona fide. </T3>One chemical producer suggested EPA should grant potential production allowancesbased on producers' past export activity. This producer argued that tobe equitable, an allocated quota system should rely on past activitiesas the basis for granting all allowances including any potential productionallowances. EPA believes that <T3>past </T3>export activities are properly dealt with in the contextof calculating baseline consumption allowances and should not be used asa basis for allocating potential production allowances. To do so wouldunnecessarily link future export activity to past activity. Since any controlledsubstance produced could be exported, total production is a more appropriatebasis for allocating potential production allowances. As a result, therule provides that potential production allowances are allocated on thebasis of total production allowances and not on the basis of past exports.Another chemical producer suggested that the 10 percent limit on potentialincreases in halon production was too low because only a few relativelylarge production plants exist throughout the world and any industrial rationalizationwould necessarily have to involve increases greater than 10 percent. Thecommenter recognized, however, that any changes in the allowable increaseswould require modification of the Protocol. EPA is concerned that allowinghalon production increases of more than 10-15 percent for the purposesof industrial rationalization would further concentrate production in afew countries and create problems of potential monopoly power. A public interest group stated that EPA should take action to ensure thatany added production exported ``to supply the basic domestic needs'' ofdeveloping countries who qualify under Article 5 of the Protocol is usedonly for such needs and not reexported either as bulk chemicals or in productsproduced with or containing these chemicals. EPA believes that ensuringthat Article 5 countries use imported CFCs and halons for their ``basicdomestic needs'' is a Protocol enforcement issue within the purview ofthe Parties and not EPA. Since the Protocol does not define ``basic domesticneeds,'' EPA would risk placing inappropriate constraints on developingcountries when the purpose of Article 5 is to encourage such countriesto join the  Protocol. EPA is also not equipped legally or financiallyto police how controlled substances are used in other countries. Compliancemonitoring and enforcement issues are due to be taken up by the Partiesat their first meeting within one year of the Protocol's entry into forceand at that time implementation of the ``basic domestics needs'' provisioncan be addressed. EPA also received several comments on its implementation of the industrialrationalization provision. A chemical company commented that EPA's wasfaithful to the intent of the Protocol negotiators that Parties be allowedto increase production somewhat in order to export controlled substancesto other Parties. In contrast, a public interest group commented that productionincreased ``for purposes of industrial rationalization'' should be allowedonly where the Party receiving the increase decreases its production bythe same amount and where one of the two specified purposes_achieving economicefficiency or responding to shortfalls in supply as a result of plant closures_isbeing served. The industrial rationalization provision of the Protocol is somewhat ambiguous,since at least two of its key terms could be interpreted in different ways.Industrial rationalization is defined in part as ``a transfer of a calculatedlevel of production between Parties.'' ``Calculated level of production''could refer to the right to produce controlled substances or the producedcontrolled substances themselves. Similarly, ``transfer'' could refer toexchange of rights or simply trade in produced substances. EPA has interpreted the industrial rationalization provision in light ofthe United States negotiators' understanding of the purpose of that provision.According to the lead United States negotiators, the industrial rationalizationprovision was included to permit some future flexibility in world marketsfor controlled substances. In 1986, the Protocol's baseline year, onlya few nations were major exporters of controlled substances; a productioncap based on 1986 levels with no allowances for limited growth would thuseffectively lock in 1986 export-import relationships until substitute chemicalswere available. By allowing some increase in Parties' production levels,the Protocol negotiators hoped to facilitate future competition in theworld market. EPA has thus interpreted the terms of the industrial rationalization provisionmentioned above to mean trade in controlled substances between Parties.The Agency notes, moreover, that because the Protocol does <T3>not </T3>allow for any exceedence of Parties' consumption limits, tradein controlled substances effectively results in a transfer of productionrights after 1992. Under the Protocol, Parties may not import controlledsubstances from non-parties beginning one year after the Protocol entersinto force, and exports to non-Parties may not be subtracted in calculatinga Party's consumption level as of January 1, 1993. Thus, the Protocol ineffect creates a Party wide ``bubble'' of controlled substance production.If one Party increases its production by the 10 or 15 percent allowed,it must export that to a Party or decrease its imports from Parties tostay within its consumption limit. The Party that imports the increasedproduction or loses the export of its own production will, in turn, haveto decrease its own production (or export it to another Party) in orderto stay within its consumption limit. Thus, a transfer of production rightscan be said to have occurred. EPA finds further support for its interpretation in the contrasting Protocolprovision for transfers involving 25-kilotonne Parties (Article 2, paragraph5). That provision expressly provides that the total combined calculatedlevels of production of the Parties involved in the transfer concernedcannot exceed production limits imposed by the Protocol and that the ProtocolSecretariat be notified of any such transfer. The industrial rationalizationprovision contains no similar requirement that a production increase byone Party be offset by a production decrease by another. The Agency does not believe it is necessary to require firms engaging inindustrial rationalization to prove that they are doing so for the specifiedpurposes. Economic theory suggests that in a free market, agreements tobuy and sell are based on what the participants consider to be in theireconomic self interest. A firm's decision to export its production is thusby definition ``economically efficient,'' one of the two purposes industrialrationalization is to serve.While EPA believes that it has correctly interpreted the industrial rationalizationprovision, if the Parties to the Protocol clarify this provision in a mannerinconsistent with EPA's interpretation, the Agency intends to modify itsrule accordingly. EPA received three comments from chemical producers that it had unnecessarilylimited production transfers with 25-kilotonne Parties to those involvingtransfers to the United States, whereas the Protocol allows transfers ofproduction both to and from 25-kilotonne Parties. EPA has modified itsfinal rule to allow for this added flexibility. However, in the case oftransfers of rights to 25-kilotonne Parties, EPA recognizes that interestsbeyond the narrow commercial ones of the involved firm may be at stake.For example, transfers may adversely impact domestic industry and may havebroader trade implications. As a result, EPA has reserved the right toreview and approve any proposed transfers of production rights to entitiesoutside the United States. Any trades occurring under this transaction are also limited in size becauseEPA believes that the Protocol negotiators did not intend 25-kilotonneParties to exceed the 25-kilotonne ceiling as a result of the transfer.The Protocol negotiators were concerned that under the agreement's reductionschedule, it would become uneconomic for low-producing Parties to continueproduction. They therefore provided that Parties with less than 25-kilotonnesof production in 1986 could transfer their production rights to anotherParty that could produce controlled substances economically, or receivetransfers of rights so that they could maintain economic production levels.They did not intend to allow 25-kilotonne Parties to actually <T3>increase</T3> their production capacity as a result of buying rights,but to make use of other Parties' existing capacity or their own. (Thisapproach is consistent with that taken to developing countries; negotiatorsallowed Parties to increase their production in order to supply developingcountry Parties and obviate the need for developing countries to buildfurther production facilities.) Accordingly, EPA will only approve transfersto 25-kilotonne Parties that do not result in the Party's total productionrights exceeding 25 kilotonnes. <ITAG tagnum="81">9. Availability of Consumption Allowances in Addition to BaselineConsumption Allowances (andSection; 82.10) </ITAG>Under this section, firms may receive additional consumption allowancesupon proof of export of controlled substances. This provision is consistentwith the Protocol's definition of consumption as production plus importsminus exports. EPA apportioned baseline consumption allowances equal to1986 production plus 1986 imports minus 1986 exports. As a result, if theUnited States exported no controlled substances after the Protocol takeseffect, it will still be in full compliance with the Protocol. Accordingly,to the extent controlled substances are exported, additional consumptionallowances can be authorized without violating the consumption limits establishedby the Protocol. In the initial years of the Protocol's operation, additional consumptionallowances will be issued for all exports. However, the Protocol providesbeginning on January l, 1993, exports of controlled substances to non-Partiesshall not be subtracted in calculating the consumption level of the exportingParty. To reflect this limitation, andSection; 82.10(b) prohibits the grantof additional consumption allowances for exports to non-Parties also beginningon January 1, 1993. Seven commenters (chemical producers and a trade association) stated thatEPA had unnecessarily restricted the issuance of additional consumptionallowances until exports had been received in the country of destination.They suggested that EPA instead consider a shipment an export when it departsthe United States so that additional allowances for the shipment couldbe obtained much sooner. Since additional consumption allowances and authorizationsto convert potential production allowances to production allowances canonly be used during the control period in which they are granted, any significantlapse of time between shipment and the grant of allowances would substantiallyundermine the ability of firms to obtain and use these rights, particularlyduring the last quarter of a control period. These commenters argued thatgranting allowances at the time of export would not create a loophole (e.g.,controlled substances not counted by any nation) as long as all nationsagree that exports would be counted at the time of departure and importsat the time of arrival. The technical experts at the Nairobi meeting similarlyrecommended that a shipment should be considered an export at the timeit leaves the country of origin. EPA has decided to grant consumption allowancesand authorization to convert potential production allowances upon proofthat controlled substances have been shipped from the United States, onthe assumption that the other Parties will also consider a shipment anexport upon its departure and an import upon its arrival. Such a uniformapproach, which the technical experts group has recommended, will permitadequate monitoring of Parties' compliance. However, if the Protocol Partiesdo not adopt the technical experts' recommendations, EPA will reconsiderits treatment of this issue. Three commenters (one chemical producer and two halon users) also requestedthat EPA specify a time limit in which it will process requests for additionalconsumption allowances and other administrative reviews. EPA is not nowin a position to accurately assess the time it will require to processapplications, but will endeavor to minimize any delays in reviewing andacting on such applications. It will consider at some later date, as partof its operating procedures, establishing a goal for timely processingof applications. Two chemical producers suggested that exporters be allowed to credit themselveswith additional consumption allowances and conversion authority upon exportingand that EPA should monitor these exporters' activities by conducting anannual audit of each firm. EPA cannot accept this suggestion because itwould create far too much uncertainty as to whether a particular exportqualified for additional allowances and thus whether the United Stateswas complying with the Montreal Protocol. EPA also believes that an affirmativedecision by EPA on each application for additional allowances would reducethe possibility of fraud and provide greater market certainty for futuretransactions involving production and consumption allowances. <ITAG tagnum="81">10. Exports to Parties (andSection; 82.11) </ITAG>This section sets forth the process by which any person may export controlledsubstances to another Party to the Protocol and obtain from EPA authorizationto convert potential production allowances to production allowances. Theauthorization will only be valid during the control period in which itis issued. Requests for authorization to convert will also be considereda request for additional consumption allowances under andSection; 82.10.Following the export of a controlled substance and receipt of authorizationto convert potential production allowances to production allowances, therecipient has two options. If the person holds potential production allowances(issued under andSection; 82.9), he may use his conversion authorizationto produce controlled substances consistent with andSection; 82.11 or, ifhe does not hold potential production allowances, he may transfer his conversionauthorization under andSection; 82.12 to a person that does. In keeping withthe Protocol, EPA's rule sets a 10 percent limit on potential productionallowances for the freeze and 20 percent reduction stages for Group I andGroup II controlled substances and a 15 percent limit for the 50 percentreduction stage for Group I chemicals. As discussed above in the context of the issuance of additional consumptionrights (andSection; 82.10), several commenters requested that EPA considera shipment an export when it leaves this country, instead of when it arrivesin another. EPA has modified the rule to allow for exports to be countedat the time they leave the country. As a result, EPA has dropped that partof andSection; 82.11 which requested, as part of the application for authorization,the date the shipment arrived at the foreign destination. <ITAG tagnum="81">11. Transfer of Production and Consumption Allowances (andSection; 82.12)</ITAG>EPA's proposed andSection; 82.12 permitted the transfer of the allowancesgranted under this rule subject to certain procedural safeguards. Thistransfer section is reserved in today's final rule pending further reviewof the procedural safeguards. Even without the transfer provision, theregulation fully implements the Montreal Protocol. However, EPA recognizesthat the transfer provision will make the rule more economically efficient.EPA expects to promulgate a final transfer provision in advance of theeffective date of today's regulation. <ITAG tagnum="81">12. Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements (andSection; 82.13)</ITAG>The December 14 NPRM outlined alternative reporting and recordkeeping requirementsfor producers, importers and exporters of controlled substances. Generally,EPA proposed that producers and importers maintain daily records of productionor imports and submit monthly reports to EPA to monitor compliance. EPAalso proposed that producers file and periodically update annual productionplans for compliance purposes. Similarly, the Agency proposed that exportersreport their shipments on a monthly basis. In the December 14 preamble,EPA outlined several options of varying detail for reports and recordkeeping(52 FR 47504). In the discussion that followed those options, EPA statedthat it was leaning toward requiring more detailed requirements to facilitateits monitoring of compliance. Since the December 14 proposal, EPA has reviewed the comments on thesereporting and recordkeeping requirements. In addition to these comments,EPA has met with the producers of controlled substances to discuss thereporting burdens of the proposed rule, and visited three plants to reviewcurrent producer recordkeeping practices. <T3>a. Producers. </T3>(1) Daily Recordkeeping_The December 14 proposedrule requested that producers maintain the following information: Dailyrecords of the quantity of the controlled substances produced at each facilityincluding controlled substances produced and consumed for feedstock purposes;daily records of the quantities of HCFC-22 and CFC-116 that may also beproduced at the same facilities; continuous records of the reactive temperaturesand pressures within the primary reactor and initial distillation columnat each facility during the production operations; daily records of purchasesand uses of specified materials consumed in producing the regulated chemicals;and daily records of the quantity and purchaser of controlled substancesproduced at each plant (Section 82.13(e)). The proposal required that theserecords be retained for a period of four years. EPA requested daily records to obtain precise information on productionas well as important independent checks for verification. These checksinclude the quantity of feedstock consumed in production and the volumeof chemicals which could be produced within the same production unit (i.e.,HCFC-22 and CFC-116), as well as sales of these chemicals. EPA believedthat the more precise information would aid in verifying reported productionand pinpointing violations. Seventeen commentors believed that these daily recordkeeping requirementswere unnecessary and excessive. Specifically, several commentors believedthat such parameters as feedstock materials bought and used, records ofsales volumes and customers, and reactor temperatures and pressure wereunnecessary and in some cases meaningless as checks on production. In reviewing the recordkeeping practices of producers, EPA found that muchof the information required by the proposal is currently recorded on adaily basis by the industry. Since this information is already being recorded,EPA does not believe that a requirement for daily recordkeeping is excessivelyburdensome, and therefore maintains with modifications that requirementin the final rule. EPA recognizes that while continuous records of reactivetemperature and pressure may provide a check on production, they wouldalso entail detailed analysis for compliance monitoring when other informationis available. For this reason, these parameters have been eliminated fromthe daily recordkeeping requirements. EPA has also eliminated the requirementfor sales records which were to be maintained for each plant. In many cases,sales are recorded at the producer level but not at the plant level; basedon its review, EPA believes that shipments serve as a better check on production.EPA has also eliminated recordkeeping requirements for the quantities offeedstocks purchased. Since these raw materials may be used in the productionof chemicals other than controlled substances, purchase records may notprovide a useful check on quantities of raw materials consumed for productionof controlled substances. For the final rule, producers are required to maintain dated records ofthe quantity of the CFCs and halons produced at each facility includingthe dated records of the quantity of controlled substances used as feedstocksin the manufacture of controlled substances and in the manufacture of non-controlledsubstances, any virgin, used or recycled controlled substances introducedinto the production process of new controlled substances. They are alsorequired to keep records of the following feedstock materials consumedin producing the regulated chemicals at each plant: Carbon tetrachloride,perchloroethylene, chloroform, hydrofluoric acid, chlorine, bromine, CFC-113;HCFC-22; and CFC-23. EPA requests records of feedstocks consumed sinceEPA can approximate the quantity of controlled substances produced by monitoringthe materials consumed. Producers must also maintain dated records of HCFC-22and CFC-116 produced within the same facility or production unit of a controlledsubstance. The production volume of HCFC-22 and CFC-116 will help determinethe duration of time in which facilities are dedicated to the productionof controlled substances if the plant maintains year round production.The Agency also requires records for the quantity of used or recycled controlledsubstances, the date received, and the names and addresses of the sourcesof recyclable or recoverable materials containing controlled substanceswhich are recovered at each plant. EPA is also requesting that recordsof shipments of controlled substances from plants be maintained. This isa new requirement, recommended in discussion with industry, which is basedon current practices and which EPA believes will aid the Agency in verifyingproduction. Based on a review of producer's methods of monitoring CFC and halon production,EPA believes that current methods of recordkeeping will generally be sufficientto satisfy the recordkeeping requirements. EPA is aware that some producersmay not make daily production estimates over weekends, and that productionmay not be measured directly but determined from records of consumption,shipments, and inventories. EPA believes these accounting procedures areacceptable for purposes of this regulation, but needs to verify that currentlymaintained records are sufficient to comply with recordkeeping requirements.EPA is requiring producers to submit within 120 days of publication ofthis rule a report detailing how production is measured on a regular basisand how this data will be used to determine quarterly production figuresin kilograms. Any change in accounting and measurement methods must bedescribed and submitted to EPA within 60 days of the change. EPA reservesthe right to require alternate measurement techniques if deemed necessary.EPA has altered the requirement that these records be maintained from aperiod of four years to a period of three years. EPA believes that it maybe necessary to review historical production records during investigationsof potential violations and that three years of past activity should proveadequate for such review. (2) Production Reports. In the December 14 proposal EPA requested monthlyreports within 15 days after the reporting period from producers of thecontrolled substances for each plant and for all plants owned by the samecompany. EPA requested that the reports include summaries of monthly productionof the controlled substances; quantities of HCFC-22 and CFC-116 producedthat month at each facility; monthly summaries of the quantity of salesfor each of the controlled substances; the quantity and source of materialcontaining recoverable controlled substances and the quantity of controlledsubstances recovered; summaries of total monthly and control period-to-dateproduction of the calculated levels of Group I and Group II controlledsubstances; and the producer's total consumption allowances, productionallowances and authorization to convert potential production allowancesto production allowances. In their comments, industry members argued that quarterly or annual reportingwas sufficient, and that a 30- to 45-day filing period at the end of thereporting period was necessary. In addition, commenters believed that thereporting of unregulated chemicals was not required to measure compliance.After consideration of these comments and based on meetings with producersand site visits, EPA has determined that quarterly reports with a filingperiod of 45 days after the close of the reporting period are appropriate.Quarterly reporting will provide EPA with periodic review of producer'scompliance with the regulation during a control period and help targetinspections while minimizing the reporting burden on producers. EPA hasextended the filing period to 45 days to allow companies adequate timeto review and verify their reports and to allow companies with more thanone plant to compile the information into a single report. EPA has consideredfiscal quarters rather than actual quarters. However, the Montreal Protocoldoes not allow EPA the flexibility to shift to fiscal control quarters.Therefore EPA requires that producers report on a quarterly basis consistentwith the applicable control period. Since one purpose of these reports is to provide EPA with information toverify production, EPA requests that producers submit the following information:Summaries of quarterly production of the controlled substances, specifyingthe quantity used and consumed as feedstock for controlled and non-controlledsubstances; the quantity, the date received and source of material containingrecoverable controlled substances and the quantity of controlled substancesrecovered; summaries of total quarterly and control-period-to-date calculatedproduction levels of Group I and Group II controlled substances; and theproducer's total expended and unexpended consumption allowances, expendedand unexpended production allowances, potential production allowance, andauthorization to convert potential production allowances to productionallowances, as of the end of the quarter. One change in the proposed reporting requirements involves reporting ofthe quantity of shipments from each plant for each of the controlled substances,instead of sales. This change has been made because shipments are a moreaccurate check than sales on production and records of these are currentlymaintained by producers. EPA has deleted the requirement that producersreport the quantities of HCFC-22 and CFC-116 produced. This informationis still required for recordkeeping purposes so that it can be reviewedduring site inspections, but need not be included in reports to EPA. (3) Annual Production Plan. EPA proposed in the December 14 NPRM that producerssubmit annual production plans for each facility and notify the Agencyof any significant shifts in the location or quantity of production. EPAbelieved that such plans would provide useful information for monitoringcompliance. Industry members commented that the production plans are an unnecessarycheck on compliance. Furthermore, although firms are likely to developan annual production plan for internal purposes, these plans rarely agreewith actual monthly or quarterly production volumes. They also objectedto the requirement that companies would need to notify EPA when productionshifts occurred to meet demand shifts. EPA no longer believes that continualjustification of production volumes with the production schedules in theproduction plan will assist it in monitoring compliance. For this reason,EPA has eliminated the annual production plan as a reporting requirement.<T3>b. Importers. </T3>(1) Daily Recordkeeping_EPA proposed that importersmaintain daily records of the quantity of controlled substances imported;the dates and ports of call for imports; the date and port of entry intothe country; the dates on which and the country in which the imported controlledsubstances were produced; and a name of a person from whom additional informationcan be obtained. Similar to daily recordkeeping by the producers, EPA proposeddaily recordkeeping by the importers to provide more precise informationon import activities which would aid in evaluating trades and, pinpointingviolations and allow comparison with U.S. Custom and Census data. Comments on proposed daily records from importer's related primarily tothe scope of items to be recorded. Because imports are now counted at thetime they are received in a country, it is no longer necessary to knowthe date on which they were produced. For the same reason the Agency willnot require the dates and ports of call for imports. The final rule requires that importers maintain daily records of the following:the quantity of virgin used and recycled controlled substances imported;the date and port of entry into the United States or its territories; thecountry from which the imported controlled substances were exported andthe port of exit. In addition, EPA requires importers to record the commoditycode and his importer number for each shipment. Importers must also keepthe following documentation to verify imports: the bill of lading, theinvoice and U.S. Custom's Entry Summary Form (Form 7501). This informationwill allow EPA during compliance checks and investigations of potentialviolations to check U.S. Census reports against shipments. Retention ofthe bill of lading and the invoice is necessary to provide EPA with anindependent check on quantities imported, separate from Census and Customsdata. (2) Monthly Reporting. EPA proposed to require importers to submit a monthlysummary of the information recorded on a daily basis. In addition, monthlyreports by importers were to include totals for control-period-to-dateand the importer's total consumption allowances at the end of the month.Commenters generally believed that monthly reporting is too frequent andthat quarterly reporting would be sufficient. They also argued that a 30-dayfiling period after the close of the reporting period is needed to provideaccurate reports to EPA. For the final rule EPA requires that importers, like producers, file quarterlyreports within 45 days of end of the reporting period. Importers may receiveshipments at several ports throughout the country and 45 days are neededto collect this information. EPA believes that these companies need sufficienttime to summarize the information and report accurate quantities. Alsosince several importers are also producers, the reporting period for importersshould be consistent with the 45 day reporting period for producers. Thesereports must include the following: The quantity of controlled substancesthat are imported in that quarter; the calculated levels of Groups I andII controlled substances imported for the quarter and the total for thecontrol period; the total quantity of expended and unexpended consumptionallowances the importer holds at the end of the quarter. The importer mustalso provide a summary of his import activities which shall include thequantity of each import, the date and port of entry into the United Statesor its territories; the country from which the imported controlled substanceswere imported and the port of exit; and a name and address from whom additionalinformation can be obtained. In addition, the commodity code and his importernumber have been included to assist with comparison and verification ofimporter records with U.S. Census and Customs records. <T3>c. Exporters. </T3>EPA proposed that exporters who did not report underandSection;andSection; 82.10 and 82.11 of the rule submit reports within onemonth of export which would include the name and address of the exporterand recipient of the export; the exporter's Employer Identification Number(EIN); the type and quantity of controlled substances exported; the dateon which and port from which the exports were shipped; the date and countryto which the exports were shipped; and the date and source from whom theexported controlled substance were purchased. EPA requested the informationto provide a basis for independently verifying that exports were shipped.EPA has modified these reporting requirements for exporters not requestingadditional consumption rights under andSection;andSection; 82.10 and 82.11.Firms not requesting additional consumption rights must report within 45days of the end of the control period. EPA requires this information tocomply with the Montreal Protocol and therefore does not believe that monthlyreporting is necessary. Since consumption rights are not requested forthese exports, periodic monitoring and independent verification is notneeded. Consequently, these exporters need only report at the end of thecontrol period. From these exporters EPA requires the following: name and address of exporterand recipient of the exports, the exporter's Employer Identification Number(EIN); the type and quantity of controlled substances exported and thepercent that is recycled or used; date and port from which the exportswere shipped. The commodity code of the shipment is a new requirement whichallows EPA to verify these shipments. Also, because exports are now tobe counted at the time of their departure from this country instead oftheir date of receipt in a foreign country, EPA has eliminated the requirementthat exporters report the date of a shipment's arrival in the receivingcountry. EPA has maintained the date and source from whom the exportedcontrolled substance were purchased as a reporting requirement to ensurethat in calculating its national consumption limit, only virgin controlledsubstances that are exported are subtracted from its total consumption.EPA has added andSection; 82.13(b) regarding the use of reports and recordsfor purposes of compliance determinations to clarify the Agency's originalintent that the records and reports required would be used not only forcompliance monitoring, but also for compliance determinations. EPA doesnot intend to limit the use of other evidence admissible under the FederalRules of Evidence. The Federal Rules of Evidence permit the introductionof all relevant evidence, subject to limited exceptions. EPA is deferring decision on whether to make public any or all of the abovereporting information required under andSection; 82.13. EPA solicited publiccomment on this issue in its May 24, 1988 supplemental proposal. The reportingrequirements will not become operative until after the rule takes effect,which will not occur before January 1, 1989, and the first reports willbe submitted after that time. Affected persons must at the time of submissionspecify what of the submitted data is covered by 40 CFR Part 2, SubpartB, which governs the treatment of business information, or a waiver ofany confidentiality claim will have occurred. EPA plans to make a determinationas to the releasability of the reporting information at some future date.<ITAG tagnum="81">13. Payment of Fees (andSection; 82.14) </ITAG>In the preamble to the December 14 proposal, EPA discussed requiring paymentof an administrative fee to cover the costs of operating the program (52FR at 47505). This fee would be imposed under the Independent Offices AppropriationAct (31 U.S.C. 9701). The preamble described what activities might be coveredby the fee, how EPA might determine the costs of these activities, andhow the fee might be implemented. While seeking comment on these issues,EPA did not propose specific fee language in its proposed rule (proposedSection 82.14 was simply reserved for this purpose). Many commenters objected to the imposition of an administrative fee. Fourteenchemical producers and users stated that the fee proposal had not beenadequately detailed in the proposal, and that therefore EPA should nottake final action without additional comment. Two chemical producers arguedthat EPA, by streamlining its administrative processes, could avoid anyneed for a fee to cover administrative costs. EPA believes that modifications in the reporting and recordkeeping provisionshave substantially reduced the administrative burden associated with theoperations of the allocated quota system. Moreover, until the program begins,it is difficult to determine the costs of operation. The number of transfersand exports are unknown and will largely determine total program costs.Assuming a limited number of such transactions, EPA does not believe thatsubstantial Agency resources will be required to operate the program andis concerned that the costs of operating the fee program will be a substantialshare of the total costs of the allocated quota program. Because of these concerns, EPA has not included in this notice a finalprovision requiring payment of an administrative fee. However, the Agencyintends to reserve andSection; 82.14 and will determine at some future dateif resource costs justify promulgating an administrative fee requirement.<ITAG tagnum="81">14. Appendices to Part 82 </ITAG>As part of the December 14 NPRM, EPA set forth several appendices to theproposed rule. Appendix A contains the ozone depletion weights for eachof the controlled substances. These weights are based on the atmosphericlifetimes and the amount of bromine and chlorine in each of the chemicalscontained on the list. The weights are used in determining the ``calculatedlevels'' of each controlled substance_the quantity of the chemical multipliedby its ozone depletion weight.Appendix A contains the ozone depletion weights specified by the MontrealProtocol with one exception. EPA has included a weight of 6 for Halon 2402,whereas the Protocol leaves this weight for future determination. EPA received several comments, questioning the scientific basis for theozone depletion weights assigned to the halons. EPA clearly stated in thepreamble to the December 14 NPRM that the weights assigned to the halonsare based on more limited research than those assigned to the CFCs andtherefore are substantially less certain. However, the current weights,including that assigned to Halon 2402, represent the best available informationfrom the scientific community. Additional work is underway to review thedetermination of ozone depletion weights for each of the controlled substances.This analysis will be examined as part of the periodic assessments requiredby the Protocol and modifications to the weights will be made, if warranted.Moreover, if the Parties adopt a different weight for Halon 2402 than thatcontained in the final rule, the Agency will consider revising that aspectof the rule. Two commenters from the refrigeration industry expressed concern that theweights for several of the CFCs had changed from prior EPA publicationsand that the change had led to CFC-115 being ``unexpectedly'' added tothe list of substances covered by the Montreal Protocol. EPA notes thatthe basis of the ozone depletion weights for the CFCs has not changed,but that the context in which the weights are being used has shifted. EarlyEPA studies reported weights on a per molecule basis which is generallymore useful for the purposes of atmospheric modelling. When the contextin which these weights were used shifted to regulatory controls, it becomesmore appropriate to report weights on a per kilogram basis. Thus, the weightonly changed to correspond to a change in the applicable unit of measurement.CFC-115 was appropriately included in the Protocol because it is amongthe commercially available fully halogenated compounds. Taking these comments into consideration, EPA has not altered the ozonedepletion weights included in Appendix A, but will continue to monitorrelevant research and will modify these weights in the future if new informationwarrants such change. <ITAG tagnum="81">15. Preemption of State and Local Regulations </ITAG>Numerous commenters have urged EPA to state that the final rule preemptsany state or local law. Section 159(b) of the Clean Air Act provides thatif EPA adopts a regulation to protect the stratosphere, ``no state or politicalsubdivision thereof may adopt or attempt to enforce any requirement respectingthe control of any such substance, practice, process, or activity to preventor abate such a risk, unless the requirement of the state or politicalsubdivision is identical to the subject of such regulation.'' EPA doesnot interpret section 159(b) as meaning that the adoption of any federalregulation of any substance, practice, process, or activity would preemptthe entire field of stratospheric ozone regulation. As the Report by theCommittee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce (House Report 95-294 (1977)p. 99) explained, ``Thus, for example, if the Administrator were to promulgateregulations limiting or prohibiting use of halocarbon compounds as foamingor blowing agents in certain industrial processes, states and localitieswould be preempted from regulating or prohibiting such use of such compounds,except in accordance with federal regulation. State or local regulationof other uses of such compounds would not be preempted thereby, however.''In EPA's view, states and political subdivisions would be prohibited fromadopting any production or import limits not identical to those in EPA'sregulation. However, since EPA's regulation only covers the productionand importation of CFCs and halons, state or locally imposed limits, forexample, on specific uses would not be precluded by the preemption provision.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Impact of Proposed Action </ITAG>As part of its evaluation and response to public comments, EPA has revisedits RIA. The results of the final RIA are described in the following sections.Significant comments received on the December RIA and on issues raisedin the December 14 NPRM, along with EPA's response to these comments, arealso presented. A. Reductions in Ozone Depletion Today's final action should substantially reduce the threat of stratosphericozone depletion and the accompanying risks to human health and the environment.As shown earlier in Table 3, in the absence of regulatory action to limitthe growth of CFCs and halons, ozone depletion of greater than 50 percentby the year 2075 would be likely. Implementation of the Protocol by theUnited States, most of the other developed nations and a large majorityof the developing nations are projected to reduce the risks of depletionto under 2 percent in 2075. Because 37 nations have already signed theMontreal Protocol, assumptions concerning widespread participation by bothdeveloped and developing countries appear reasonable. Given the large uncertainties inherent in the current atmospheric models,in projecting long-term growth rates for the relevant trace gases, andin predicting the degree of participation by other nations in the Protocol,EPA believes its action represents a reasonable response to the ozone depletionthreat established by the scientific evidence available at the time ofthis rulemaking. However, as described above, the Ozone Trends Panel Summarysuggests that important new evidence will soon be available. EPA intendsto seek public comment on the full report when it becomes available andintegrate this new evidence into a supplemental risk assessment the Agencyis currently preparing. EPA also intends to work toward expediting andactively participating in upcoming assessments and reviews called for bythe Montreal Protocol. B. Economic Impact As part of the accompanying RIA, EPA examined the potential costs to UnitedStates industry of meeting various levels of reductions in CFC and halonproduction and consumption. It also analyzed and compared these costs tothe potential health and environmental benefits of reduced exposure toharmful ultraviolet radiation which would result from measures to protectthe ozone layer. The health and environmental benefits assessed are thoseaccruing to the United States alone, but are based on the assumption thatmost other nations, through their participation in the Montreal Protocol,join in making the same level of reductions undertaken by this country.As explained in the preamble to the December 14 NPRM and detailed in thefinal RIA, the cost analysis takes a ``bottom up'' approach. It examinesuses of CFCS and halons within eight major industrial groupings: Refrigeration;air conditioning; flexible foam; rigid foam; solvent cleaning; sterilization;fire extinguishant; and miscellaneous. Within these larger groupings itexamined 74 specific use applications (e.g., commercial refrigeration,home refrigeration, etc.). To determine costs, the RIA examined over 900technologically feasible options for reducing consumption of these chemicals.Since many of these options were eliminated from consideration becauseof high costs or possible toxicity, the analysis drew from approximately300 technically feasible responses to controlling the use of CFCs and halons.The potential benefits examined in the RIA also cover a broad range ofhealth and environmental impacts. Any significant shift in the quantityand make-up of ultraviolet radiation striking the earth's surface wouldrepresent a major change in one of the basic environmental parameters,affecting most forms of biological life. While the RIA attempts to quantifysome of the likely major impacts (e.g., skin cancers), limited researchcompleted to date prevents the quantification of other potentially significantrisks (e.g., immune suppression). <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Economic Costs of Reductions </ITAG>The analysis contained in the RIA examines and provides cost estimatesfor a wide variety of different control options over a long period of time.The types of controls examined include: Engineering controls; chemicalsubstitutes; product substitutes; changes in work practices; and recyclingand recovery technologies. The analysis sought to include technologiesthat were currently available, along with those that were likely to becomecommercially available over the next decade. It also took into considerationsuch factors as changes in energy costs and compliance with other relevantenvironmental requirements (e.g., water pollution or worker exposure restrictions).Estimates of the costs of reducing CFC or halon use to specified levelsare developed using the Integrated Assessment Model (IAM), which is detailedin Appendix I of the RIA. Essentially, this model operates by prioritizingthe potential reductions in CFC and halon use on the basis of least costand the judgment of EPA contractors and staff based on discussions withindustry representatives on how firms are likely to respond to reductionrequirements. Several commenters raised concerns with the RIA's cost projections.Two chemical producers stated that EPA had underestimated the costs ofreductions. In particular, they claimed that the large number of optionsthat EPA predicted would save money suggested that EPA had left out factorsaffecting costs. EPA has reviewed its cost documentation and analysis andmodified some of the cost estimates based on the additional informationprovided by commenters. (Specific changes are presented in Part 10 of VolumeIII of the RIA.) However, EPA's information and analysis still show thatmany options to reduce CFC and halon use can be implemented at little orno cost, and in some cases can decrease costs. Cost-saving options existbecause all firms involved in using CFCs and halons do not possess perfectinformation as to available controls. Recent attention to this issue hasalready dramatically reduced the cost of obtaining information on controloptions. As a result, firms in certain industry segments are beginningto shift away fron these chemicals without incurring production cost increases.In any event, the RIA assumed zero costs (i.e., no cost savings) for thosecontrols which EPA believes in some cases, based on engineering analysis,can save firms money. Other commenters stated that an industry-supported economic analysis (Putnam,Hayes and Bartlett, 1987), which they argued contained cost projectionsthat were substantially greater than those of the preliminary RIA, presenteda more realistic estimate of future costs of compliance. EPA has reviewedboth the methodology and the results of the industry's study. Unlike EPA'sRIA which linked costs and reductions to specific technologies, the industry'sanalysis is based on industry's expert opinion on the quantity of reductionsit would make if CFC prices increased by a certain amount. Because of thisstreamlined approach to estimating costs, it is extremely difficult toidentify and compare specific differences in the two studies. Nonetheless,the results of the two studies do not differ dramatically. In fact, whendifferences in scope (e.g., treatment of halons) are taken into account,the industry's analysis generally falls well within the range of estimatespresented in the RIA accompanying both the proposed and final rules. In addition to making corrections and including new information providedin the public comments, EPA has also updated the engineering costs containedin its RIA to reflect rapidly emerging technologies to reduce and replaceCFCs and halons. For example, in the time since the December NPRM was published,the food packaging industry reached an agreement to voluntarily eliminateits use of CFC-11 and -12 (generally by shifting to HCFC-22 and blends)by the end of this year. A major chemical producer has announced a blendof CFC-113 which contains 25-30 percent less of this chemical than currentformulations at no additional costs and with no loss in cleaning effectiveness.A large electronics firm working with a small chemical company announceda terpene-based solvent substitute for use in some electronics cleaning.Work has also progressed on alternative blowing agents (e.g., HCFC-22,HCFC-141b, and HCFC-123) for many foam applications including insulation.Segments of the car air conditioning and servicing industries and the airconditioning and refrigeration industries have stepped up activities aimedat facilitating increased recycling and recovery at the time of servicing.In addition, further testing has been conducted on a blend containing dimethyletherwhich reduces the use of CFC-12 in existing refrigeration and auto andspace air conditioners. These options have now been incorporated into theRIA's cost analysis. Some are already being used by firms and are thereforeconsidered in each scenario examined. Others, though promising, are notyet fully proven and commercially available, and therefore are examinedas part of different cases (scenarios) presented in the RIA which comparethe costs of compliance based on different assumptions about the timingand market penetration of various control technologies. To reflect the substantial impact that the timing and degree to which thesetechnologies are adopted by user industries have on cost estimate projections,the analysis in the RIA focuses on two cases. The differences in thesecases are the rate at which firms adopt these measures, the percent ofthe firms in an industry who take this action (e.g. market penetration),and the quantity of emission reductions achieved by the technology. Case1 assumes that key user industries delay their adoption of reduction technologies,market penetration of these controls is limited, and the magnitude of reductionsthey achieve is on the low end of the amount that now seems plausible.In contrast, Case 2 assumes that technologically available low-cost reductionsare adopted expeditiously by key user industries. Specifically, in Case2, the RIA assumes the following reduction technologies are employed withinthe next few years: Shifts to HCFC-22 in specific markets for rigid foaminsulation; increases in recovery of CFCs from refrigeration; switchesby some percentage of hospitals to disposable instruments and steam cleaninginstead of CFC based sterilization; improved housecleaning by solventsusers and substantial shifts to CFC-113 blends, terpene or aqueous cleaners;increases in recycling of CFC-12 at large auto shops when servicing carair conditioners; and shifts to water blown foam or modified polyols bymolded and slabstock flexible foamers. Table 4 presents the total social costs of complying with Case 1 and 2for reductions required by the final rule (i.e., the Montreal Protocolcase). It demonstrates that the costs through 2000 of meeting the controlrequirements could nearly triple depending on the rate at which firms adoptreduction technologies. The cost differential is substantially greaterfor the near term rather than over the longer term. Table 4 also shows the potential windfalls or transfer payments which wouldresult from this regulation. The potential amount of windfalls also variesconsiderably between the Case 1 and 2, particularly in the early years.The analysis suggests that even in Case 2, with its optimistic assumptionsabout shifts away from CFCs, the allocated quota system would create windfallsof almost $2 billion dollars through the turn of the century.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>4._<T4>Social and Transfer Cost Estimates for Cases </T4>1 <T4>and </T4>2 <T4>Cost Scenarios </T4>a <ITAG tagnum="96">[In millions of 1985 dollars]  </ITAG><H1>  </H1><H1>Case 1 </H1><H1>Case 2</H1>  Social Costs: b <ITAG tagnum="1"> 1989-2000 <D>2,730 </D><D>1,012 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> 1989-2075 <D>39,530 </D><D>20,760 </D></ITAG>Transfer Costs: c <ITAG tagnum="1"> 1989-2000 <D>7,300 </D><D>1,900 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> 1989-2075 <D>13,600 </D><D>6,900  </D><F/>a The assumed stringency and coverage used in this analysis arethose of the CFC 50%/Halon Freeze case described in Chapter 5 of the RIA.CFCs are regulated with an initial freeze in 1989 at 1986 levels, 20 percentreduction in 1993, and 50 percent reduction in 1998, and halons are frozenat 1986 levels in 1992.

Price increases are cited on a standardized ``ozone-depletingequivalent'' basis per kilogram.</ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Health and Environmental Benefits </ITAG>The preliminary RIA described a wide range of potential health and environmentaleffects of ozone depletion. This description was based largely on the analysiscontained in EPA's risk assessment. As described in the risk assessment (and the SAB's review of it), varyingamounts of research have been completed on different health and environmentaleffects. For example, while considerable research has led to the identificationof a dose-response relationship between UV-B radiation and nonmelanomaskin cancer, only a limited number of case studies exist showing the natureof the impact of increased UV-B radiation on the formation of groundlevelozone (smog). In fact, the SAB panel's interim report stated that theybelieved that the potential risk of harm was greater for some of the healthand environmental effects where little was known (e.g., immune suppressionand damage to plants and aquatics organisms) than for other areas wherebetter information was available (e.g., skin cancers). Because of these concerns, EPA attempted to develop dose-response relationshipsfor many of the potential health and environmental impacts. This sometimesinvolved extrapolating from short-term case studies on one or more speciesor regions. EPA quantified these effects primarily to provide policy-makerswith an illustration of the potential magnitude of impacts in these areas.Substantially more research will be necessary before reliable dose-responseestimates are possible, particularly in the areas of plant and aquaticeffects. A chemical company and an industry research organization criticized EPA'sefforts to quantify one or more of the potential environmental impacts(e.g., plant and aquatic effects, urban ozone formation and polymer degradation).As discussed above, EPA recognizes the limitations inherent in extrapolationsfrom limited case studies, but believes that the analysis contains theappropriate caveats and, on balance, provides useful information for policy-makers.A public interest group criticized EPA for not including experimental resultsfrom Antarctica demonstrating dramatic losses in phytoplankton from increasedexposure to UV-B radiation. EPA did not include this information in theRIA analysis because it has not yet been peer reviewed and therefore isof a preliminary nature. The Agency intends to more fully explore the potentialhealth and environmental effects of the Antarctica ozone hole as part ofits update of its risk assessment. One chemical producer and a government agency criticized the RIA's estimatesof future skin cancer cases and deaths. They suggested that the publicwould modify its behavior and avoid exposure and/or that improvements inmedical technology would reduce damage and deaths from this form of cancer.EPA knows of no evidence supporting the theory that behavior will be modifiedto avoid exposure. It also notes that behavioral changes, if they occurred,would themselves be a cost of ozone depletion. Nonetheless, the RIA includesa sensitivity analysis which reduces by 25 percent predicted mortalityrates for skin cancers. In another sensitivity analysis, all mortalityrates are reduced (e.g., medical advances decrease mortality from all causesnot just from skin cancers). These results are presented in Chapter 10of the final RIA and show the reduced number of projected deaths from skincancers which occur under these assumptions. One commenter raised the question of whether a recent report showing thatUV-B radiation had decreased in the past decade suggested that the modelslinking ozone depletion to increased UV-B radiation were inaccurate. Acceptedscientific theory suggests, if the ozone layer had depleted over the pastdecade, UV-B radiation striking the earth should have increased. EPA hasreviewed the study cited by the commenter and believes that several aspectsof its design may make its results unreliable. While the physical propertiesof ozone's absorption of UV-B radiation are well established in the scientificcommunity, this particular study is based on a limited network of monitoringstations. Moreover, the monitoring sites are typically located near airportswhere increases in local pollution could have influenced the results. Norhas the effect of possible changes in local weather conditions (e.g., cloudcover and precipitation) been evaluated. EPA will continue to monitor researchrelated to direct measurements of UV-B radiation, but does not believethat the study mentioned by the commenter provides sufficient grounds foraltering its current assessment.Other commenters stated that the relationship between UV-B and both melanomaand cataracts was so uncertain that it could not be quantified. While EPArecognizes that greater uncertainty exists as to the dose response relationshipfor these health effects, the RIA applies the methodology developed andreviewed as part of EPA's risk assessment document. In the case of melanoma,EPA conducted an extensive review of the literature and organized a panelof experts to explore its relationship to UV-B radiation. For both melanomaand cataracts, the findings contained in the EPA's risk assessment wereextensively reviewed and approved by the SAB. Table 6 provides a summary of the health and environmental benefits ofreducing ozone depletion to the extent that would occur if the MontrealProtocol were widely implemented. Because of the uncertainties in theseestimates, it also provides a range of values based on sensitivity analysesof key variables. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s50,r50 </C><T4>Table </T4>6._<T4>Summary of Benefits From Reduced Ozone Depletion </T4>a  <H1>  </H1><H1>Reference scenario</H1>  <ITAG tagnum="1">Skin cancer cases (low and high sensitivity) <D>173.9 million (91 million to 306 million). </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Skin cancer deaths (low and high sensitivity) <D>3.7 million (1.9 million to 6.8 million). </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cataract cases (low and high sensitivity) <D>19.1 million (10.4 million to 26.0 million). </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Damage to crop yields (low and high sensitivity) <D>7 percent (extrapolation of soybean dose-response). </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Decrease in fish harvests (low and high sensitivity) <D>25 percent (extrapolation of anchovy dose-response). </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Damage to polymers (low and high sensitivity) <D>3.6 billion (extrapolation of PVC dose-response). </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Increase in tropospheric ozone (low and high sensitivity) <D>29 percent (based on case studies from three cities). </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Sea level rise (low and high sensitivity) <D>12.6 cm (</D>andplusmin; 50 percent). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Non-quantified Benefits Increase in actinic keratosis Immune suppressionTropospheric ozone impacts on pulmonary system </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pain and suffering from skin cancer </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">All temperature related effects </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Beach erosion from sea level rise </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Loss of coastal wetlands from sea level rise </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">UV effects on aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Tropospheric ozone impacts on non-grain crops, forests, other plantspecies, and man-made materials </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">UV effects on materials currently in use  <F/>a Benefits are derived by comparing health and environmental impactsin the absence of control (i.e. no controls case) to the Montreal Protocolcase (i.e. 50% CFC/halon freeze case).</ITAG></ITAG> Assumptions 1.

Health effects (skin cancer cases and deaths and cataractcases) are modelled based on dose-response estimates developed for EPA'srisk assessment (EPA, 1987), and are summarized in Chapter 7 of EPA's RegulatoryImpact Analysis (EPA, 1988). Damage to crops from UV-B is presented forgrain crops only based on dose-response developed for soybeans (EPA, 1987and 1988). Damage to fish; is estimated for commercial harvest of fin andshell fish based on dose-response models developed for anchovies (EPA,1987 and 1988). Increase in tropospheric ozone and damage to crops arebased on case studies of 3 U.S. cities and national crop loss model (EPA,1987 and 1988).

Comparison of Costs and Benefits </ITAG>Based on the costs and benefits presented above and detailed in the RIA,today's final action should result in a substantial net gain to society.Comments on the RIA accompanying the December NPRM raised several issuesconcerning assumptions used in valuing benefits. Two federal agencies questionedthe statistical value of life used in the RIA. One argued that it was toolow and the other that it was too high. The preliminary RIA used a rangeof from $2-5 million with a reference case value of $3 million. Followinga review of the economic literature, the final RIA maintains the valueof $3 million, but a new study (Viscusi, 1988) suggests that this figuremay substantially underestimate risks. As a result, a sensitivity analysisusing a $12 million dollar value of life is also presented. A value of$2 million has been retained in the RIA to represent the low end of therange. These figures are used for illustrative purposes in performing theanalysis in the RIA. Based on its review of the comments, the RIA doesnot conclude whether the value of reducing risks to human life for involuntaryrisks can be limited to $3 million dollars or whether it should be higheras suggested by new information contained in the economic's literature(Visusi, 1988). A government agency also stated that the discount rate used in assessingcosts and benefits over time was too low and that the RIA inappropriatelyincreased the future value of life. Another government agency stated thatthe value of human lives should not be discounted. Appendix G of the RIApresents the justification for the assumptions contained in the final RIA.Where the benefits are long-lived and long lags exist before the benefitsaccrue, a discount rate toward the lower end of the range commonly understoodas representative of the social rate of time preference was selected asan appropriate illustration in conducting the RIA. The RIA increases the value of life over time to reflect the assumptionthat as society becomes wealthier, people are willing to pay greater amountsof money to reduce risks. EPA believes that this assumption is true andnecessitates increasing the future value of life in the analysis. The RIAcontains sensitivity analyses which examine alternative assumptions forboth of these factors. These results do not alter the conclusion of theanalysis. <ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Additional Information </ITAG>A. Executive Order 12291 Executive Order (E.O.) 12291 requires the preparation of a regulatory impactanalysis for major rules, defined by the order as those likely to resultin: (1) An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more;(2) A major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic industries;or (3) Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.EPA has determined that this rule meets the definition of a major ruleunder E.O. 12291, and has prepared a regulatory impact analysis (RIA).Drafts of that document and this notice of rulemaking were submitted tothe Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review under Executive Order12291. Any comments from OMB and any EPA responses to such comments areavailable for public inspection at the Central Docket Section, South ConferenceRoom 4, Docket No. A-87-20, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 MStreet SW., Washington, DC 20460. A copy of the RIA has also been placedin the rulemaking docket. <ITAG tagnum="81">B. Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601-612, requires that Federalagencies examine the impacts of their regulations on small entities. Under5 U.S.C. 604(a), whenever an agency is required to publish a general noticeof proposed rulemaking, it must prepare and make available for public commentan initial regulatory flexibility analysis (RFA). Such an analysis is notrequired if the head of an agency certifies that a rule will not have asignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities,pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b). EPA prepared an initial regulatory flexibilityanalysis when the regulation was proposed on December 14, 1987. This initialRFA draft was placed in the public docket for public comment. The final draft of the RFA has incorporated comments submitted during thepublic comment period in response to the proposed rule. These commentsrefined EPA's cost estimates of alternative substitutes available, bothproduct and chemical, to all industries affected by the regulation. Thefinal RFA concludes that of the many industries affected by regulationsof CFCs and halons that only some segments of the foam-b1owing industrywere potentially at risk. In contrast to almost all other uses of thesechemicals, it is only in the foam industry that CFCs are a large percentageof final product cost. Significant price increases of CFCs could potentiallyaffect the current market share of these products. Different segments of the foam industry are likely to be affected in differentways. Some segments have currently available technologies which are costcompetitive with potential product substitutes. For example, as discussedabove, the foam food packaging industry has entered into a voluntary agreementto shift out of CFC-11 and -12 blown foam to use HCFC-22 and blends bythe end of the year. Thus, the impact on this industry segment will beminimal. Similarly, the industry segment that makes flexible molded foam(used primarily for seat backs of autos) is capable of eliminating theuse of CFC-11 as an auxiliary blowing agent with minimaI cost impact. Amajor supplier to the extruded polystyrene boardstock insulation industryalso recently announced plans to eliminate the use of CFC-12 in the manufactureof these products consistent with the availabiIity of substitutes. Together,these shifts represent a significant share of total use of CFCs by thefoam industry. However, the situation is less clear for two segments_polyurethane sprayedand foam insulation and boardstock. The insulating board foam industryis experimenting with several alternative blowing agents (HCFC-22, HCFC-123and HCHC-141b). To the extent these substitutes are determined to be technicallyand economically viable, the longer term impact on these firms will beminimized. However, the near term impact (before substitutes are commerciallyavailable) will be largely determined by the cost of CFCs, which, in turn,rests on the speed at which other industries reduce their demand for thesechemicals and the product quality and consumer preference for product substitutes.The RFA estimates that the market for these two foams will not grow asmuch in the future, and may shrink under pessimistic assumptions aboutmarket penetration of product substitutes. However, the expected impactfor current market share of these foams manufacturers are minimal. The foam industry comments on the RFA asserted that EPA's description ofthe structure of the industry was overly simplistic and its portrayal ofthe control options available in part inaccurate. The information providedby the commenters has led EPA to modify both of these aspects for the analysis.The revised analysis includes a more detailed breakdown of the industryand revised and updated engineering costs for reduction technologies (e.g.,HCFC-22 for food packaging and polyethylene, HCFC-141b as a possibilityfor polyurethane, etc.). EPA has attempted further to refine energy costsrelated to product substitutes for insulation and to better understandconsumer demand for high quality or established goods when inexpensiveproduct substitutes are available as in the case of rigid foam packagingwhich will likely maintain their market share despite the availabilityof low-cost substitutes.Based on the analysis contained in the revised RFA, EPA does not believethat any foam industry segment will be substantially harmed over the longterm. It recognizes, however, that short-term CFC price jumps, if theyoccur, would have a significant impact on the competitiveness on the rigidfoam insulation market. To address this concern, EPA intends to closelymonitor the price of CFCs and the progress made by all industries in reducingtheir use of these chemicals. C. Paperwork Reduction Act As required by andSection; 35.04(H) of the <T3>Paperwork Reduction Act, </T3>44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq., </T3>EPA has submitted a copy of these revised informationcollection requirements to the Office of Management and Budget for itsreview. OMB has tentatively approved the paperwork sections other than andSection;82.12. EPA has reserved andSection; 82.12 and is still reviewing alternativeapproaches to implement a trading program. OMB expects to complete theapproval process of paperwork requirements other than those necessary toimplement andSection; 82.12 and will assign an information collection controlnumber after the 30 day comment period. Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimatedto average 52 hours per response for producers, 48 hours per response forimporters, and 4 hours per response for exporters. These estimates includetime for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, and completingand reviewing the collection of information. All recordkeeping requirementsare considered to be ``usual and customary'' burden as defined under 5CFR 1320.7 and, as such, are not included in the estimate of respondentburden. Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of thiscollection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burdento Chief, Information Policy Branch, PM-223, U.S. Environmental ProtectionAgency, Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office of Information and RegulatoryAffairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503, marked``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.'' <ITAG tagnum="84">VII.

(g) For Group I controlled substances, beginning with the first controlperiod specified under andSection; 82.3(f)(1), and for Group II controlledsubstances, beginning one year after the Montreal Protocol enters intoforce, importers of controlled substances during a control period mustcomply with the following recordkeeping and reporting requirements: (1) Any importer must maintain the following records: (i) The quantity of each controlled substance imported, either alone orin mixtures; (ii) The date on which the controlled substances were imported;(iii) The port of entry through which the controlled substances passed;(iv) The country from which the imported controlled substances were imported;(v) The port of exit; (vi) The commodity code for the controlled substances shipped; (vii) The importer number for the shipment; (viii) A copy of the bill of lading for the import; (ix) The invoice for the import; and (x) The U.S. Customs Entry Summary Form. (2) For each quarter, every importer must submit to the Administrator areport containing the following information: (i) Summaries of the records required in paragraph (g)(1)(i)-(vii) of thissection for the previous quarter; (ii) The total quantity imported in kilograms of each controlled substancefor that quarter; (iii) The calculated levels of import (expended allowances) of Group Iand Group II controlled substances for that quarter and totaled for thecontrol-period-to-date; and (iv) The importer's total sum of expended and unexpended consumption allowancesat the end of that quarter. (h) For any exports of controlled substances not reported under andSection;82.10 (additional consumption allowances) or andSection; 82.11 (Exports toParties), the exporter who exported the controlled substances must submitto the Administrator the following information within 45 days of the endof the control period in which the unreported exports left the United States:(1) The names and addresses of the exporter and the recipient of the exports;(2) The exporter's Employee Identification Number; (3) The type and quantity of controlled substances exported and what percentage,if any, of the controlled substances that are recycled or used; (4) The date on which and the port from which the controlled substanceswere exported from the United States or its territories; (5) The country to which the controlled substances were exported; and (6) The commodity code of the controlled substance shipped. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 82.14</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89"> Payment of fees [Reserved]. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s25,10 </C><T4>Appendix A </T4><H1>Controlled substance </H1><H1>Ozone depletion weight</H1> <T3>A.
