Intelligence agents boarded a commercial flight from Tokyo andarrested the Rev. Moon Ik-hwan, 71, for violating security laws byvisiting communist North Korea and discussing reunification withPresident Kim Il Sung.   His traveling companion, Yoo Won-ho, also was arrested. Theywere led from the jet's rear door and taken away.   Officials said Moon would be questioned by the Agency forNational Security Planning, the main intellligence agency.   South Korean law allows Moon to be interrogated for 10 daysbefore he is turned over to prosecutors, who have 40 days toinvestigate before indictment. Officials said a trial was expectedin late July or early August.   Prosecutors said Moon would be charged with visiting North Koreato receive instructions from a hostile government and with``praising anti-state elements.'' Penalties range from five yearsto death, but it is unlikely he would e executed.   Moon visited Pyongyang, capital of North Korea, on March 25 andmet with Kim about reuniting the peninsula, which has been dividedsince World War II. It is illegal for South Koreans to visit NorthKorea without government approval.   North Korea has said relations would be harmed if South Koreaarrested Moon, who is an adviser to the United National DemocraticMovement, the largest dissident movement.   Kim's government already postponed a political meeting Tuesdaywith South Korea without giving a reason.   The South Korean government of President Roh Tae-woo has crackeddown on dissidents, arresting five leaders in the past week, and isreassesing its policy toward the North. Officials in Seoul haveindicated they may delay all talks, including a meeting on sportsscheduled for Tuesday.   Lee Hong-koo, the national unification minister, said theclergyman's trip should not affect basic policy toward North Korea,but indicated the pace of talks may be slowed.   He said Prime Minister Kang Young-hoon and other officials wouldmeet Friday to consider policy toward the North.   About 6,000 radical students held violent protests of the arrestin at least seven cities Thursday, fighting with riot officers whoblocked them from marching off their campuses, authorities reported.   They said 1,053 protesters were arrested in Seoul, Pusan,Kwangju, Chonju, Taegu, Chunchon and Inchon, but most were released.   Police detained 700 radicals who tried to reach YonseiUniversity in Seoul for a rally to welcome Moon. Fifty studentswere arrested after about 1,000 marched off the campus and weregreeted with volleys of tear gas.   Students at four other colleges in Seoul hurled firebombs androcks at police, who fired tear gas and threw the rocks back atthem. About 3,000 students clashed with police in the southern portof Pusan and 2,000 fought riot squads in Kwangju, also in the south.   Protesters shouted: ``Murderer Roh Tae-woo cannot arrest MoonIk-hwan!'' About 12,000 riot police were deployed at Kimpo Airportand other locations in Seoul. At the airport, officers arrestedabout 60 dissidents who got into the terminal through the cordon,then unfurled banners and yelled slogans.   South Korean officials say North Korea's dealings with Moon werean attempt to undermine the Seoul government's authority. Theyclaim that Moon and other dissidents aid North Korean attempts togain control of the entire peninsula.   Moon's visit appears to have damaged the dissident movement bylinking it to North Korea, which began a three-year war in 1950 byinvading South Korea. Dissident leaders have defended the trippublicly, but concede privately that it damaged their credibility.</TEXT></DOC>
