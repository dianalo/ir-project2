 A contractthat defines the way the software will be used seems innocuous enough.andP;  Likemost contracts, however, a software license is written in inscrutablelegalese that ordinary mortals can't begin to understand.andP;  And, even if userscan decipher the license, they will likely feel that it's weighted in thevendor's favor.andP;  Of course, users tend to forget that vendors also havelegitimate interests to protect.andP;  It's no wonder that so many users andsoftware vendors end up in court, leaving a judge to wade through a muddy,ambiguous licensing agreement to determine who's right.andM;Software licensing doesn't have to be a horror show, however.andP;  A sensible,practical agreement can make licensing less painful for vendors and usersalike.andP;  The main thing is to iron out all your concerns during the licensenegotiation so that they don't come back to haunt you.andP;  In this column, I'llfinish up my three-part series on software licensing by looking at someimportant provisions that benefit both users and vendors.andM;Escrow.andP;  As I've mentioned in the past, software escrow involves placing thesource code in the hands of an impartial and disinterested third party--theescrow agent.andP;  Software escrow is one of the most equitable licensingarrangements around, because the agent's job is to ensure that the needs ofboth vendor and user are met.andM;The agent can limit access to the source code only to authorized users, onlyunder specific conditions set out in the agreement and only in a way thatprotects the vendor's rights to the software.andP;  But the agent can alsoguarantee users access to the source code if the vendor goes out of businessor is otherwise unable to meet obligations.andM;Warranties.andP;  As far as users are concerned, vendors should absolutelyguarantee that software will perform according to the specifications set outin the licensing agreement--in other words, a vendor should provide awarranty.andM;The vendor may go along with the idea of a warranty.andP;  In practice, though,the vendor may want to scale down the warranty's scope and duration so thatit's almost no warranty at all.andP;  For example, a vendor might propose awarranty that applies only to defects that arise within the first two monthsof the agreement.andM;As you might imagine, a lot of the high-tech litigation churning through thecourts these days revolves around software warranty disputes.andP;  But users andvendors can avoid lawsuits if they they work together to hammer out warrantyprovisions before signing their licensing agreements.andM;Assignment by user.andP;  If the user named in the agreement is a largecorporation, it may want the power to assign its licensing rights to any ofits subsidiaries or affiliates without having to pay the vendor an additionalfee every time.andP;  This kind of free assignment of rights by the user is poisonto vendors, however, since they believe that they deserve the extra licensefees.andM;A well-drafted licensing agreement can often address the concerns of bothsides.andP;  For instance, the agreement might establish a reasonable assignmentfee while simultaneously maintaining the user's right to assign the licenseto an entity of his or her choice.andP;  To prevent problems, however, it's bestto ensure that the agreement is as specific as possible about the sorts ofentities to which the user will be able to assign licensing rights.andM;Assignment by vendor.andP;  There are also situations in which vendors want toassign their software licenses to other vendors.andP;  For instance, small vendorslacking the resources to market their software may opt to assign their rightsto big vendors or distributors.andP;  This practice could spell trouble for users,however, because the company to which the rights are assigned could easilyrefuse to honor warranties offered by the original vendor.andM;To avoid potential disputes here, the user should insist that the licensingagreement also be binding on the vendor's assignees.andP;  Thus, if the originalvendor makes any warranties or commitments, the distributor or other assigneemust honor them.andM;Trade secrets.andP;  Users may complain, but vendors do have a right to safeguardtheir source code and any documentation associated with it.andP;  Therefore, avendor may opt to include a trade secret clause in the licensing agreement toensure that all copyrights, trademarks and modifications associated with thesoftware remain the vendor's property.andP;  Again, an unambiguous trade secretclause benefits both sides by forestalling potential ligitation.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
