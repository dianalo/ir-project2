KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Legislation to bridge the gap between thepending medium-range missile reduction treaty and a future pact tomake deep cuts in long-range nuclear arms was introduced in theSenate Thursday.   The bill calls for temporary mutual limits on U.S. and Sovietdeployment of long-range strategic arms until the negotiation of anew Strategic Arms Reduction or START treaty.   The legislation declares that the two superpowers should notexceed the levels of specified nuclear weapons they had in thefield on Jan. 25, 1988, the date the medium-range accord wassubmitted to the Senate.   Both nations would have to agree on such limitations before theycould take effect.   The bill was introduced by Sens. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark.; PatrickLeahy, D-Vt.; John Chafee, R-R.I.; and John Heinz, R-Pa.   Bumpers said that both supporters and opponents of the pendingIntermediate-range Nuclear Forces or INF treaty agree that themilitary advantages of the pact to the United States and its alliescan be overcome by the Soviets if Moscow deploys additionallong-range weapons to make up for the medium-range missiles it willbe required to destroy.   ``Our legislation provides guidelines for temporary mutualrestraints to reinforce the INF treaty until we get a strategicarms agreement,`` Bumpers said.   Leahy added: ``Unless we stop or slow deployment of new Sovietstrategic missiles, the INF treaty will be a dead letter.''   ``Without any cap on intercontinental missiles, the Soviets willsimply add more strategic warheads to cover the same NATO targetsonce covered by the SS-20 intermediate-range Soviet missiles,''Leahy said.   Leahy said it is now clear that no agreement will be reached ona START treaty at the Moscow summit meeting in late May betweenReagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   By calling for an interim freeze on multiple warhead missilesand bombers, the legislation will maintain the viability of the INFtreaty pending the achievement of a more far-reaching START treaty,he said.   Chafee said the treaty will protect the advances made by the INFtreaty and improve chances of reaching agreement on cuts inlong-range arms.</TEXT></DOC>
