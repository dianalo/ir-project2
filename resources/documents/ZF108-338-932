A host of smartpeople wasting time on dumb forms.andM;We looked at three packages that save you much of that trouble.andP;  Theseprograms create smart forms that can be filled out electronically: IndigoSoftware's JetForm Design, Delrina Technology's PerForm Designer and Filler,and Xerox's FormBase.andP;  AU have Wysiwyg interfaces.andP;  All allow you to designthe blanks with database-like field definitions, spreadsheet-likecalculations, and lookup instructions that pull information from existingdatabases.andM;JetForm and PerForm have superior design tools, the chief goal of which is tocreate form templates that can serve as electronic repositories for data fromother applications (notably DBASE) or information entered item by item at thekeyboard.andP;  These two packages have separate design and fill modules.andP;  Thedesign module creates form template files, and the fill module creates datafiles to fill in the templates.andM;FormBase, on the other hand, marries the form and the data.andP;  FormBase formsare active database records that can be linked, searched, and sorted just asthe records in a DBASE database can.andP;  Unfortunately, Xerox sacrificed somedesign tools along the way.andP;  The current version of FormBase won't let youzoom in and out of a form, and it has few drawing tools and no rulers orvisible snap-to grids to ease the pain of duplicating preprinted forms.andO;Xerox expects to correct some of these shortcomings in a release scheduled toship this quarter.)andM;Do-It-Yourself DesignandM;For creating forms, these packages include design tools that allow you tocreate and modify grids, tables, check boxes, and other special effectsunique to forms, all with a couple of mouse clicks.andM;They handle form design in basically the same way: you create a text box orother graphic and assign it attributes, such as borders, background shading,and font size and alignment.andP;  In addition, you can make the box performcalculations or call in information from another part of the form or, withthe exception of FormBase, from another application, such as a database orgraphics file.andM;All of the packages include sample forms to help you get started.andP;  Mostlikely, though, you'll want to recreate the forms you already use.andM;Recreating an existing form is painstaking work, but you do it only once foreach preprinted form.andP;  If the form isn't too complicated, you can scan itinto JetForm or PerForm and trace over it.andP;  If you are scannerless or theform is very complex, you'll have to measure all the data fields and recreatethem onscreen.andP;  Jetform and PerForm provide onscreen grids andrulers-identical to those in desktop publishing packages-to make the jobeasier.andM;You can print blank forms as needed on a laser printer, saving printingcharges and reducing waste, and you can redesign at will.andM;What Makes Smart Forms SmartandM;Smart forms won't do you much good unless you fill them in electronically.andO;Even the most sophisticated blank form-incorporating field types, formulas,and the like-is as dumb as any other once you print it.andM;With that in mind, consider the advantages of smart forms: You can fill themwith information imported from existing database files and you can designatefields as compulsory (meaning that the form can't be saved until the field isfilled).andP;  Date and time fields will stamp each record according to the PC'ssystem clock.andP;  You can insert spreadsheet-like formulas to make calculationsbased on data elsewhere on the form-so, for example, an invoice will multiplythe prices by the quantities ordered, calculate tax and any discounts, andprint a total at the bottom.andM;Plus, you can assign validation formulas to fields: for example, the formula&quot;Age andgt; 21 &quot; will return an error message if the number entered in the Agefield is less than 21.andP;  Then, when a confused data-entry person presses akey, a help screen you've created can pop up to explain what the field meansand whom to call with questions.andM;Using Existing DBASE FilesandM;All three packages can import information from dBASE and delimited ASCIIfiles (FormBase also accepts data directly from Lotus 1-2-3).andP;  Yet theirprocedures are quite different.andP;  Consider what it takes to extractinformation from DBASE files, especially when it's coming from more than onedatabase file:andM;JetForm and PerForm let you specify, during the design process, the DBASEfile and field that the program should refer to.andP;  Then, when the form isbeing filled out, it can retrieve data from multiple DBASE files indexedaccording to a single key field.andP;  If you're filling out an invoice, forexample, and you type the customer code, Jetform or PerForm will import thecorresponding mailing address from the customer database and billing datafrom the billing database.andM;For batch printing, both products can merge an entire DBASE file into a formtemplate and print out the filled-in forms.andP;  Jetform downloads the templateto the printer only once, as an overlay, so that only the data for each formis sent to the printer.andP;  This is much faster for batch printing thanPerForm's method, which merges individual records into each template andrepeatedly sends both for printing.andM;FormBase can import entire DBASE files, but it can't import the contents ofindividual fields from those files.andP;  Once the data is in a FormBase database,however, this package offers by far the most sophisticated lookup routines.andM;What do these packages do with the data once it's inside the form? Jetformand PerForm want to keep it to themselves, each data record in a separateASCII file.andP;  You can export updated information from these packages back toDBASE, but it can be a dangerous process.andM;FormBase wants you to forget about your DBASE files and start buildingFormBase databases.andP;  Because the database and the form are one, changing thedata in one record changes all other records with the same data.andP;  Andchanging a form (deleting a field, say) changes the database.andM;Using Database Files from a NetworkandM;These packages also vary greatly in the network support they offer.andP;  One ofJetform's greatest strengths is its ability to merge data from existingapplications into forms.andP;  Its DOS-based server product, JetForm Server,allows you to send a data file to the server with instructions about whichform to merge the data into and where to print it.andP;  For example, you couldtake a sales order over the phone, send the data file to the server, andinstruct the server to print out one form in shipping, another in productfulfillment, and still a third in accounting.andM;PerForm gives a nod to the networked world by selling a five-user LAN Pack ofits form-filling module.andP;  The PerForm Filler LAN Pack has record locking toensure that one record isn't updated by two people at once.andP;  Form templatescreated with the PerForm design module can also be filed on the server, sothat you're always working with the most recent version of the form.andM;FormBase can run on any PCNet-compatible network.andP;  Multiple users can havesimultaneous read-only access to FormBase records.andP;  The program has filelocking to prevent more than one user from working on the same form/database.andM;Forms of the FutureandM;Technological innovation will continue to bring order to the gathering andmanagement of forms and data.andP;  On the hardware side, Xerox has recentlydeveloped carbonless multipage paper for nonimpact printers.andP;  Rapid advancesin color printing mean that it's only a matter of time before your laserprinter is able to do anything a four-color press can do-only cheaper.andM;One day you'll be able to reproduce any form by scanning it into your PC,having your software convert the graphics into easy-to-manipulate vectorfiles and the text into ASCII files.andM;Networking applications will open new avenues for forms processing and maysoon offer the ability to route forms through several departments.andO;Individuals could sign off with a password, then forward the form for moreapprovals.andP;  Products could also offer security, in which passwords couldactivate certain forms or even fields on a form.andM;Today, with minimum expense and effort, you can manage much of your formsprocessing with a PC.andP;  While lower-end forms software could always design andprint dumb forms on your desktop, this new generation of packages createsintelligent forms.andP;  This is software that soon pays for itself by reducingthe amount of time that smart people spend shuffling dumb forms.andM;FormBase combines rudimentary form drawing with a full-fledged relationaldatabase so that your form acts as a data-entry screen, a front end for adatabase, and a Wysiwyg copy of a printed form.andP;  Pros: Can query, search,sort, append, and join on any field.andP;  Good network support.andP;  Macro recorderincluded.andP;  Cons- Limited form design features.andP;  Can import scanned imagesonly via Windows clipboard.andP;  Only 60 days of free tech support.andP;  Updatesplanned/release date: A second-quarter update will include rulers, bar codesupport, zoom, onscreen preview, faster printer drivers.andM;DESIGNandM;FormBase runs under Windows; a runtime version of Windows is supplied.andP;  Formdesign tools are limited: the current version has no zoom features, rulers,comb tool, or bar code support.andP;  Supports Bitstream fonts.andP;  Can import andscale graphics imported through Windows clipboard (requires full version ofWindows).andP;  Image field type allows creation of image databases.andM;SMART FEATURESandM;Field Types: Text, numeric (scientific, currency, percentage, fixed), date,time, image, protected.andM;Calculation: Fifty functions, including four-function math, logicaloperators, relational operators, global data change, trig functions,averages, string manipulation (concatenation, maximum/ minimum values,conditional statements).andM;Error-checking: FormBase checks entered data against validation formulas.andO;Will match text against a list of acceptable entries.andP;  Can build help intodata-entry screens.andP;  Custom error messages.andM;Import/export/lookup: Import WK1, DBF, ASCII, and Windows-compatible imagefiles.andP;  Sort, perform complex queries, and make corrections from the formscreen.andP;  Query by example using multiple key fields and wildcards.andP;  Appendnew records to existing database files.andP;  Create links between forms: updatingan item on one form updates it on linked forms with the same data.andM;Xerox FormBase Version 1.8, $495.andP;  Xerox Corp., 9745 Businesspark Ave., SanDiego, Calif.andP;  92131; 800-8228221.andP;  Requires PC AT or better, 640K RAM (1MBadditional RAM recommended for 80286 machines, 2MB for 80386 machines),Windows-compatible graphics adapter, mouse, and output device.andP;  Runtimeversion of Windows is supplied.andM;Case StudyandM;Automated Price Quote SystemandM;Terra LinkandM;Tulsa, OklahomaandM;Terra Link, a software and hardware dealer, assembles hardware/softwarepackages from as many as 15 computer manufacturers to meet a customer'sspecifications.andM;BEFORE: Price quotes were assembled from a variety of documents: numbers froma spreadsheet, text from a word processor, and manufacturers' prices frompaper catalogs.andP;  No consistent format existed.andP;  If a price quote led to anorder, the salesperson reassembled the information from source documents forthe order-entry person.andM;APPLICATION: Terra Link used FormBase to design a standard price-quote formwith calculation features.andP;  The company created FormBase databases ofcustomer, product, and pricing information (much of it supplied by themanufacturers in DBASE or Lotus 1-2-3 files).andP;  AFTER: Salespeople puttogether quotes within FornBase forms, calling up customer data, productdescriptions, and prices from the application.andP;  Now every quote that goes outthe door is organized the same way.andP;  If a price quote leads to an order, theinformation can be easily imported into an order form.andP;  Terra Link presidentJim Davison estimates that the average time to assemble a quote has droppedfrom four hours to 45 minutes.andP;  He adds that products are delivered tocustomers ten times as fast as before.andM;Great Value and Sophisticated Design FeaturesandM;Case StudyandM;Arrest ProcessingandM;Garden City Poke DepartmentandM;Garden City, New YorkandM;Fifty-five police officers on three shifts put together arrest reports to befailed with the Garden City and Nassau County police departments.andP;  Arrests inGarden City average 400 per year.andM;BEFORE: City and county arrest reports were filled out on multipart forms atthe typewriter.andP;  Up to 120 items, many with repetitive information, had to becompleted on each form.andP;  Typos had to be corrected by hand on all parts ofthe form.andP;  The arrest procedure typically took four hours, according topolice officer Al Perez.andP;  Arrest reports were filed in hard copy.andM;APPLICATION: The standard arrest forms were scanned and traced onto a PCusing JetForm.andP;  Automatic date and time stamping and transfer of &quot;pedigreeinformation&quot; (name, date of birth, address, and so on) from field to fieldwere added to the electronic forms.andP;  AFTER: Arrest procedure now takes about40 minutes-a savings of about 35 man-hours per week.andP;
