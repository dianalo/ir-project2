The attacks Wednesday by the National Liberation Army, apro-Cuban guerilla group, apparently were unrelated to thegovernment's war against drug traffickers, now entering its 10thweek.   The army has claimed for seven years, without producing proof,that some leftist guerrillas and drug traffickers work in tandem.   The government pressed ahead with the drug war Wednesday,notifying an alleged member of the Medellin cocaine cartel that hewas being extradited to the United States and taking steps toprotect presidential candidates from violence by traffickers.   According to TV Hoy, the government notified Jose Rafael AbelloSilva, 34, of his impending extradition. Police have said Abello isthe fourth most important figure in the Medellin cartel, in chargeof its activities on Colombia's Atlantic coast.   Abello, also known by his alias, ``The Monkey,'' was arrestedOct. 10 in Bogota and faces a charge by an Oklahoma federal courtof conspiracy to distribute cocaine.   According to President Virgilio Barco's extradition decree,Abello has five days to appeal the extradition.   The Barco government has extradited four accused drugtraffickers to the United States since it launched the crackdown inmid-August after the assassination of leading presidentialcandidate Luis Carlos Galan.   Suspected traffickers have responded to the crackdown with awave of bombings and assassinations.   Defense Minister Oscar Botero announced Wednesday that thedischarge of more than 18,000 soldiers was being delayed so theycould provide security for presidential candidates. The soldiers'service had been scheduled to end this month. About 80,000Colombians are enlisted in the army.   The soldiers will be used in operations before, during and afterthe presidential elections next May, Botero told reporters. Hiscomments were broadcast by TV Hoy.   The plan reportedly will cost the government more than $7million.   About 100 guerrillas invaded the towns of Cachira and La Vega inthe state of Norte de Santander early Wednesday, the army's 2nddivision reported.   The heaviest attack, by about 60 men and women, was at 1 a.m. inCachira, a town of 15,000 people about 250 miles northeast ofBogota. The guerrillas destroyed a police station with mortarshells and opened fire on police officers with automatic weapons.   Two policemen were killed and another seven injured during fivehours of fighting in the town, an army communique said.   An hour after the assault on Cachira began, another group of 40rebels invaded La Vega, 15 miles away, and tried to overrun thepolice station there. Two policemen were wounded in the seven-hourbattle.   One guerrilla died as the attackers fled the town of 5,000people into the mountains, the army communique said.   Guerrillas also ambushed police sent to reinforce thebeleaguered battalion in La Vega. Three officers died in an attackalong a dirt road outside town.   The rebel attacks were the bloodiest since 1987, when guerrillasraided an average of one town a week and more than 50 people werekilled during one month of fighting.   The national radio chain, Caracol, said two other leftistgroups, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia and the People'sLiberation Army also participated in Wednesday's attacks. The armycould not confirm the report.   The National Liberation Army, believed to have 2,000 combatants,was organized in 1960 and bases its doctrine on the teachings ofCuban President Fidel Castro.   Headed by a defrocked Catholic priest, Manuel Perez, the groupis the most active of Colombia's six guerrilla organizations. Itswore recently it would never negotiate with the government.</TEXT></DOC>
