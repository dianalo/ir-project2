Better Not Settle   In Passaic County   ---   New Jersey Judge Calls Halt   To Routine Marital Cases,   Blaming Bench Vacancies   ----   By Junda Woo   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>02/20/92</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), NO PAGE CITATION</SO><IN>LAW AND LEGAL AFFAIRS (LAW)</IN><NS>LAW andamp; LEGAL ISSUES AND LEGISLATION (LAW)</NS><RE>NEW JERSEY (NJ)NORTH AMERICA (NME)UNITED STATES (US)</RE><LP>   For 1,000 unhappily wed couples in Passaic County, N.J.,divorce will have to wait.   Superior Court Judge Nicholas Mandak, who assigns cases tothe county's 20 judges, stopped slating routine divorcesuntil some of the county's six judicial vacancies are filled.Divorces involving custody or domestic violence won't beaffected by the order, which was issued on Valentine's Dayand which takes effect March 1.</LP><TEXT>   Judges say they are overburdened, and matrimonial trialsare the least important of their various cases. &quot;We justcan't do it any more,&quot; said Superior Court Judge CarmenFerrante, noting that the superior court has handled 15,000family court cases of all types since July.   But some divorce lawyers, and many of their clients, arefuming. Generally, they've already waited two or three yearsfor their cases to come to trial. And because most divorcecases are settled before trial, the ones affected by thefreeze tend to be the most rancorous.   &quot;I can't sell my house. I don't know if it's my house orhis. I can't do anything to move on with my life,&quot; saidJudith Davis, a Wayne, N.J., resident who sought a divorcethree years ago from her husband of 23 years. &quot;No marriage isbad enough to go through this kind of pain.&quot;   Mrs. Davis, an unemployed customer service representative,said the wait is harder on her than on her husband because heis more financially stable. Michael Diamond, head of thePassaic County Bar Association, said such a pattern istypical and that women will be hurt more by the delay.   &quot;It's hard on everybody,&quot; said Wayne divorce lawyer JohnFiorello. &quot;Kids get older, incomes change. The longer adivorce drags on, the more difficult it gets.&quot;   It's unusual for a jurisdiction to freeze divorce cases,said Indiana Circuit Court Judge Howard E. Petersen,co-chairman of the American Bar Association's family courtscommittee. Most overloaded courts turn to mediators orspecial masters to ease the burden.</TEXT></DOC>
