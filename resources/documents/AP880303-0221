(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Fallen TV evangelists Jimmy Swaggart andTammy Bakker have been invited to be hosts of the annual LoyalOrder of Hibernians parade, but organizers say they won't besurprised if the answer is no.   Last year organizers invited Lt. Col. Oliver North to be grandmarshal of the half-block long St. Patrick's Day parade. The yearbefore it was deposed Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos.Neither accepted.   This year they want Swaggart, who stepped down from his pulpitafter tearfully admitting that he had sinned, to be grand marshal,said Mayor Jim Lynch.   They want Mrs. Bakker, wife of former PTL evangelist Jim Bakker,to be parade queen. Bakker stepped down last year after revelationsof sex and hush money.   ``We had a little dissension on that, but one of the guys saidif she wore green eye shade it would be OK,'' Lynch said.   They also want Republican presidental candidate Pat Robertson, aformer TV minister, in charge of publicity.   ``He has a good Irish bent for saying the first thing that comesto his mind,'' Lynch said. ``We like him because he's not toobothered with facts.''</TEXT></DOC>
