In compliance with the filing requirementsof 19 CFR 353.36, petitioners allege that imports of certain small businesstelephone systems and subassemblies thereof from Taiwan are being, or arelikely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value withinthe meaning of section 731 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act),and that these imports materially injure, or threaten material injury to,a U.S. industry.If any interested party as described under paragraphs (C), (D), (E), or(F) of section 771(9) of the Act wishes to register support of or oppositionto this petition, please file written notification with the Commerce officialcited in the <T2>For Further Information Contact</T2> section of this notice. <ITAG tagnum="84">United States Price and Foreign Market Value </ITAG>United States price was based on a U.S. list price to an end user. Petitionersthen deducted a supply house and interconnect distributor's margin to arriveat the first arm's length price. Deductions were then made for U.S. importduties, ocean freight, and insurance. Petitioners based foreign market value on manufacturers' list price todealers. An end user discount and distributor's margin was deducted toarrive at the first arm's length price. Adjustments were made for differencesin circumstances of sale to arrive at the foreign market value. Based on a comparison of United States price and foreign market value,petitioners allege a dumping margin of 45.9 percent. <ITAG tagnum="84">Initiation of Investigation </ITAG>Under section 732(c) of the Act, we must determine, within 20 days aftera petition is filed, whether it sets forth the allegations necessary forthe initiation of an antidumping duty investigation, and whether it containsinformation reasonably available to the petitioners supporting the allegations.We examined the petition on certain small business telephone systems andsubassemblies thereof from Taiwan and found that it meets the requirementsof section 732(b) of the Act.
