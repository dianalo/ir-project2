The transaction, which is subject to signing of a final agreement, would bring Nerco's total 1988 purchases of Gulf Coast reserves to about $270 million. The company's Nerco Oil andamp; Gas Inc. unit said its strategy of acquiring oil and gas reserves during periods of relatively low energy prices &quot;is beginning to show positive strategic and financial benefits.&quot;    An official said Nerco Oil andamp; Gas, which had operating losses totaling $54.2 million in the past three years, has returned to profitability this year and is comfortable with analysts' projections the unit will show about $10 million in operating profit for all of 1988. Rising natural-gas prices and increased production are fueling the rebound, he said.    Nerco, which also has interests in coal and precious-metals mining, is 90%-owned by PacifiCorp, a diversified utility holding company based in Portland.    Enron said the accord is part of a previously announced plan to sell $200 million to $300 million of non-strategic oil and gas properties. With the completion of this latest pact, the company will have sold about $250 million of those properties. Proceeds will be used to help reduce Enron's debt, which stands at $3.87 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
