Tennessee also proposes to modify its existing measurementfacilities in Fairfield, Litchfield, and Hartford Counties, Connecticut.To provide the firm transportation service contemplated by the ChamplainProject, Tennessee proposes to construct an interconnection with Champlain(with flow regulation and measurement facilities) at Upton, Massachusetts.The total cost of Tennessee's proposed facilities for both the Iroquois-Tennesseeand Champlain facilities is estimated to be $224,674,000. Tennessee statesthat the proposed facilities would be initially financed by Tennessee withfunds on hand, funds generated internally, borrowings under revolving creditagreements or short-term financing which will be rolled into permanentfinancing.It is stated that Tennessee has developed two new rate schedules underwhich it will perform the Iroquois-Tennessee and Champlain transportationservices: Rate Schedule NET-EU (for cogeneration and electric power endusers) and Rate Schedule NET-LD (for local distribution companies). Tennesseeproposes to charge a single part demand rate for service under both RateSchedule NET-Eu and Rate Schedule NET-LD.As part of its application, and to effectuate Tennessee's proposed transportationservice for New England Power Company, Tennessee has also requested authorityto reduce its existing annual sales obligation under Tennessee's Rate SchedulesCD-4 and CD-5 to National Fuel by 11,635,133 Dt and 7,490,643 Dt, respectively,with specific monthly limitations as set forth below:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>5,L2,tp0,i1,s50,12,12,12,12</C> <H1> </H1><H1>Current monthly D-2 entitlement</H1><H2>CD-4</H2><H2>CD-5</H2><H1>Proposed monthly D-2 entitlement</H1><H2>CD-4</H2><H2>CD-5</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">January<D>5,558,300</D><D>3,612,275</D><D>4,724,555</D><D>3,070,426</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">February<D>5,020,400</D><D>3,262,700</D><D>4,267,340</D><D>2,773,288</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">March<D>5,558,300</D><D>3,612,275</D><D>4,724,555</D><D>3,070,426</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">April<D>5,379,000</D><D>3,495,750</D><D>4,572,550</D><D>2,971,380</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">May<D>5,558,300</D><D>3,612,275</D><D>4,418,058</D><D>2,883,279</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">June<D>5,379,000</D><D>3,495,750</D><D>4,275,540</D><D>2,790,270</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">July<D>5,558,300</D><D>3,612,275</D><D>4,418,058</D><D>2,883,279</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">August<D>5,558,300</D><D>3,612,275</D><D>4,418,058</D><D>2,883,279</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">September<D>5,379,000</D><D>3,495,750</D><D>4,275,540</D><D>2,790,270</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">October<D>5,558,300</D><D>3,612,275</D><D>4,418,058</D><D>2,883,279</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">November<D>5,379,000</D><D>3,495,750</D><D>4,572,550</D><D>2,971,380</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">December<D>5,558,300</D><D>3,612,275</D><D>4,724,505</D><D>3,070,426</D><R>n,sandCx.3;</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Total<D>65,444,500</D><D>42,531,625</D><D>53,809,367</D><D>35,040,982</D></ITAG></ITAG>It should be noted that the Commission's order of January 12, 1989 advisesall parties who have previously intervened in Docket No. CP87-451 and inthe other ``open season'' dockets to file new interventions if they wishto become parties in this application.<T3>Comment date: </T3>February 22, 1989, in accordance with Standard ParagraphF at the end of this notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">9.

Champlain also statesthat its shippers have entered into long-term supply agreements with Canadiansuppliers for the export of gas at Philipsburg, Quebec.Champlain explains that it would provide transportation service only; withthe exception of purchasing initial line pack, Champlain does not proposeto buy or sell the natural gas transported by the system. Champlain statesit would provide both firm and interruptible transportation service onan open-access basis and will, prior to or upon commencement of serviceseek authorizations under Subpart F of Part 157 of the Regulations andSubpart G of Part 284 of the Regulations. Applicant proposes that firmtransportation service will be sold under a two part (reservation charge,commodity charge) rate based on the Commission's modified fixed variablemethodology, while interruptible transportation service is proposed undera one-part (commodity) rate, based upon the firm rate at 100 percent loadfactor.Applicant proposes two rate zones. Points of delivery which are locatedat or north of mainline milepost 177 or Berkshire Branch milepost 30 arein rate Zone 1. Rate Zone 2 extends from the end of Rate Zone 1 south tothe terminus of the mainline near West Medway, Massachusetts and the terminusof the Berkshire Branch near Greenfield, Massachusetts. According to Applicant,based upon the cost of service contained in its application, the maximum100 percent load factor unity throughput charge for transportation commencingOctober 31, 1991 would be as follows:Rate Zone 1_0.3074 cents per MMBtuRate Zone 2_0.5970 cents per MMBtuApplicant states that, although precise financing for the project has notbeen determined, for purposes of its Application, such financing is basedupon a capitalization of approximately 25 percent equity contribution bythe partners and 75 percent limited or non-recourse debt. For settlementpurposes, applicant proposes that the initial rate provide for a returnon equity of 15 percent (on a levelized basis); this is a reduction inthe claimed rate of return from 16.5 percent contained in the applicationfiled on January 15, 1988.Applicant explains that it has instituted a comprehensive environmentalpublic disclosure and impact mitigation program in connection with itsproject and that it places a premium on careful environmental planningand consultation before filing with regulatory authorities. Applicant statesthat wherever possible it avoids government-held lands and wetlands andutilizes existing utility right-of-way.Applicant states that operational functions will be performed by ChamplainPipeline Operating Company, Inc.

These Settlement projects are said to includethe Champlain Project (See the filings at Docket No. CP89-646-000), theIroquois/Tennessee Project (See the filing at Docket Nos. CP89-629-000,and CP89-634-000) and the ANR Project (See the filings at Docket Nos. CP89-635-000,CP89-637-000, and CP89-638-000).According to Algonquin, the twelve customers of the Champlain Project,including Algonquin, would arrange for Algonquin to receive up to 200,800Dt/d in 1991, increasing to a maximum daily quantity of 307,174 Dt/d in1992, at an interconnection with the proposed Champlain pipeline projectnear West Medway, Massachusetts. Algonquin states that it would redeliverequivalent volumes to the eleven shippers at various points along its system(with redeliveries of up 30,000 Dt/d to one customer, Coastal Power, tobe arranged later). Algonquin includes precedent agreements with each ofthe proposed shippers as part of its application.Algonquin would purchase up to 57,600 Dt/d from Pan Alberta at the Canadianborder, which would be delivered to Champlain for transportation to Algonquin'ssystem. Algonquin would receive up to 50,600 Dt/d at West Medway for itsown supply, or, in part, for direct assignment to Fitchburg Gas and ElectricCompany (Fitchburg), and Keene Gas Corp. (Keene). Algonquin states thatit has executed letter agreements with Fitchburg and Keene, subject tosuccessful negotiations between Fitchburg, Keene, and Pan Alberta, to assignits gas supply rights with Pan Alberta, and its firm transportation rightson the Champlain system directly to Fitchburg (1,000 Dt/d at the Canadianborder) and Keene (1,500 Dt/d at the Canadian border). Algonquin furtherstates that it has also executed a letter agreement with Colonial Gas Company(Colonial), subject to successful negotiations between Colonial and PanAlberta, to directly assign to Colonial its rights to purchase up to 7,000Dt/d from Pan Alberta.Algonquin also proposes to provide firm transportation as part of the proposedIroquois/Tennessee project. Algonquin states that it would receive up to79,030 Dt/d in 1991, increasing to 90,030 Dt/d in 1992, from Tennesseeat interconnection points near Brookfield and Mendon. Algonquin would redeliverequivalent volumes to the three Iroquois/Tennessee customers at pointsin New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts.Finally, Algonquin would provide firm transportation as part of the proposedANR project. ANR, it is said, would effectuate delivery of natural gasto Columbia near Paulding, Ohio for New England Power Company's (NEPC)account. Algonquin would receive from Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation(Columbia), near Hanover, New Jersey up to 35,000 Dt/d in 1991, which itwould redeliver to NEPC's Manchester Street Station, in Providence, RhodeIsland, or to NEPC's Brayton Point Plant, near Somerset, Massachusetts.Algonquin proposes to provide the new firm transportation services undertwo new rate schedules. Firm transportation services provided for NEPCwould be accomplished under Rate Schedule X-38. Firm transportation servicesfor the other shippers would be provided under Rate Schedule AFT-2. RateSchedules X-38 and AFT-2 provide for one-part monthly demand charges whichare said to be designed to fully recoup the cost-of-service of the proposedincremental facilities. Shippers would incur monthly demand charges of$4.679 per Dt for the Champlain and Iroquois/Tennessee project volumesand $12.089 per Dt for the ANR project volumes.To provide the proposed firm transportation services described above, Algonquinproposes to construct and operate extensive facility additions. these include:12,600 horsepower of new compression at Mendon, Massachusetts; 41.6 milesof various diameter loops and delivery lateral pipeline to be located inConnecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island; and four new meter stationsand other miscellaneous modifications to existing meter stations.

CP68-178-012 <T3>et al.</T3>, pursuant to sections 7(b) and 7(c) of the Natural GasAct for a certificate of public convenience and necessity requesting (1)an allocation of existing capacity (Phase I capacity) and new annual volumetricentitlements (AVE) for its customers, (2) changes to the terms and conditionsconcerning its existing Rate Schedules G and I, (3) authorization to implementa small general resale service under a proposed Rate Schedule SGS and toimplement services on behalf of any new firm sales customers requestingand receiving an allocation of capacity, (4) implementation of conversionrights for FGT's resale and direct sales customers, (5) the withdrawalof its request for separate section 7(c) certificates to implement transportationservices under proposed Rate Schedules FTS-1 and PT, currently pendingin Docket No. CP68-128-012 and the abandonment of firm transportation serviceunder Rate Schedule T-3 and (6) other tariff changes reflecting FGT's desireto provide ``open-access'' transportation services, to alter its prioritiesof service, and to modify other provisions in its General Terms and Condition(GTC) Section of its FERC Gas Tariff, all as more fully set forth in theamendment on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. FGT states that on October 30, 1987, it submitted an Offer of Settlementand an amendment in Docket Nos. CP68-128-012 <T3>et al.</T3>, which addressed two central issues (1) justification forFGT's proposed facilities (Phase II expansion) and (2) the restructuringof the contractual relationships with its customers in order to offer anexpansion of services. Subsequently, FGT states that it has entered intofurther discussions with all of its customers and has submitted concurrentlyfour interrelated filings which address the pending service issues in DocketCP68-128-012 <T3>et al.</T3> Aside from the instant amendment, Docket No. CP68-128-013,FGT asserts the current filings are: (1) Docket No. RP89-50-000_a proposedgeneral cost of service rate increase and new rate design, (2) Docket No.CP89-555-0900_a request for the Commission's blanket transportation certificateunder Order Nos. 436 and 500, and (3) Docket No. CP89-556-000_a requestfor a blanket certificate to make sales for resale to others. FGT assertsthat all four filings are interrelated, and conditions its willingnessto accept a blanket transportation certificate on the Commission's approvalof all four applications. Therefore, FGT requests that the Commission consolidateall four applications into one proceeding. FGT hereby requests to abandon its current system of AVE's and the interimallocation plan as set forth in section 21 of the General Terms and Conditionof its FERC Gas Tariff to be effective upon its acceptance of a blankettransportation certificate under Subpart G of Part 284 of the Commission'sRegulations. FGT proposals include abandonment of all certificated levelof sales (including the use of its transmission facilities to effectuatedirect sale arrangements) and its Rate Schedule T-3 services as well. FGTrequests authorization to concurrently implement an allocation of the PhaseI capacity. FGT states that an initial allocation for Phase I, capacityis set forth in Exhibit I of Docket No. CP68-129-013; however, FGT proposesto conduct an ``open season'' starting on January 13, 1989, and concludingon March 15, 1989. FGT proposes that customers listed in Exhibit I whowish to increase or decrease the firm levels of entitlements should submittheir request within this time frame and all such requests will be consideredas being filed concurrent; it is explained. After March 15, 1989, FGT statesthat it would accept any additional request for uncommitted Phase I capacityuntil on or before April 1,1989, whereupon FGT states that it would listany request for firm capacity which cannot be accommodated on a Firm NaturalGas Service Log which FGT proposes to establish in section 14 in its GTCof its FERC Gas Tariff. On May 1, 1989, FGT proposes to revise ExhibitI of the instant amendment to reflect the results of the proposed ``openseason'' and would also file to revise the propose rates in Docket No.RP89-50-000 at that time as well. FGT further proposes to conduct an ``openseason'' for customers desiring interruptible sales or transportation services.FGT asserts that it would provide public notice of the date of commencementof such ``open season'' via its electronic bulletin board and through noticesin the Wall Street Journal and other trade publications. FGT states that in Docket No. CP68-129-012 <T3>et al.</T3> it proposed to restructure its tariff to enable it to providefirm sales for resale under Rate Schedule G and to provide preferred interruptiblesales under Rate Schedule I to be effective on the in-service date of theproposed facilities. Due to the interrelationship of the proposals in DocketNos. RP89-50-000, CP68-129-013, CP89-555-000 and CP89-556-000, FGT nowrequests that the proposed revisions to Rate Schedules G and I become effectiveupon its acceptance of a blanket transportation certificate, at which timethe allocation of Phase I capacity would also take place. FGT explainsthat the revisions requested to be made are the same as proposed previouslyfor Docket No. CP68-129-012 <T3>et al.</T3> with the following modifications: (1) The respective <T3>Rate</T3> sections reflect the proposed rate design in Docket No. RP89-50-000,(2) conversion rights which allegedly conform to the Commission's policyunder Order Nos. 500, <T3>et seq.</T3>, (3) modification to the <T3>Authorized Over-run</T3> Gas section and the elimination of the <T3>Minimum Bill</T3> section of its FERC Gas Tariff, and (4) the implementationof an <T3>Entitlement Charge</T3> section under Rate Schedule I service and theremoval of all end-use restrictions as currently implemented under RateSchedule I service. FGT also requests certificate authorization to establish a Rate ScheduleSGS service for customers purchasing less than 1,100,000 dt annually ata one-part volumetric rate. FGT states that no conversion rights to firmtransportation service would be proposed for Rate Schedule SGS servicealthough those customers identified in Exhibit I as proposed Rate ScheduleSGS customers would be provided the opportunity to receive service underFGT's Rate Schedule G during FGT's proposed ``open season''. FGT proposesto make effective the Rate Schedule SGS service upon the date it acceptsit blanket transportation certificate and requests abandonment authorityunder Rate Schedule G for those customers which would be served under theRate Schedule SGS. FGT proposes that rates for Rate Schedule SGS be establishedin Docket No. RP89-50-000. FGT states that it requested in Docket No. CP68-129-012 <T3>et al.</T3>, individual certificates to implement transportation servicesunder Rate Schedules FTS-1 and PT. FGT points out that in view of its requestfor a blanket transportation certificate in Docket No. CP89-555-000 thatsuch requests for individual transportation services are no longer necessary.Therefore, FGT proposes the withdrawal of these requests for individualcertificates and instead would self-implement proposed firm, preferredinterruptible, and interruptible transportation services under andSection;284.221of the Commission's Regulations and under the proposed Rate Schedules FTS-1,PIT-1 and ITS-1 proposed for Docket No. CP89-555-000. FGT states that in Docket No. CP68-129-012 <T3>et al.</T3>, it requested abandonment authority for a firm transportationservice on behalf of Florida Power and Light Company (FPandamp;L) as describedin Rates Schedule T-3 to be effective on the in-service dates the facilitiesproposed for Phase II expansion. However, FGT now proposes to give FPandamp;Lthe option of nominating firm transportation service under proposed RateSchedule FTS-1 or to retain entitlements under Rate Schedule T-3 service.In the event FPandamp;L elects to receive all of its entitlements under RateSchedule FTS-1, then FGT requests abandonment authority for Rate ScheduleT-3 service to be effective on the date FGT accepts a blanket transportationcertificate. FGT proposes numerous other changes to its GTC of its FERC Gas Tariff.The following are the sections which are requested for modification orinclusion into its FERC Gas Tariff: Section 9_<T3>Priority of Service,</T3> Section 9A_<T3>Priorities of Service_Pipeline Capacity,</T3> Section 9B_<T3>Priorities of Service_Scheduling</T3>, Section 13_<T3>Changes IN Contract Quantities,</T3> Section 16_<T3>Schedule of Effective Miniumum Annual Quantity</T3>, Section 16A_<T3>Conversion of Service,</T3> Section 18_<T3>Determination of Deliveries,</T3> Section 24_<T3>Order No. 497 Compliance,</T3> and Section 25_<T3>Transition Cost Recovery Mechanism.</T3> FGT states that the TransitionCost Recovery (TCR) mechanism would be amounts prudently incurred and paidby FT to its producer/suppliers in settlement of take-or-pay obligationsor to reform contract terms in such contracts. FGT states that any costpaid by FGT to Southern Natural Gas Company (SNG) relating to the flow-throughof take-or-pay costs from SNG would not be included in the proposed TCRmechanism. FGT states that the TCR mechanism would be applied as a surchargeduring the same five year period in which its existing customers may electto convert 100 percent of their sales entitlements to transportation. <T3>Comment date:</T3> February 23, 1989, in accordance with the firstsubparagraph of Standard Paragraph G at the end of this notice. <ITAG tagnum="84">15.

Iowa-Illinois requests that its section7(f) service area in Illinois be expanded to include the remainder of itsIllinois natural gas service territory, and extended to encompass a transmissionline which interconnects with the facilities of ANR Pipeline Company (ANR),all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with theCommission and open to public inspection.Iowa-Illinois states that it presently has a Hinshaw exemption for thisservice territory (Illinois Hinshaw). Iowa-Illinois is requesting thatthe area subject to its Illinois Hinshaw be included in its section 7(f)service area determination for the purpose of utilizing the opportunitiesprovided by the Uniform Regulatory Jurisdiction Act of 1988 (H.R. 2884)recently passed by Congress and signed by the President. Second, Iowa-Illinoisrequests the section 7(f) service area determination be modified by extendingthe certificated service area in Illinois to a point of interconnectionwith the pipeline system of ANR Pipeline Company (ANR) near New Windsor,Illinois. It is stated that Iowa-Illinois and ANR are constructing interconnectionfacilities which will commence at ANR's New Windsor, Illinois, CompressorStation and proceed north for a distance of approximately 10.5 miles.
