The analysisconsisted of Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy, high performanceliquid chromatography, thermogravimetric and differential scanning calorimetry,and laser Raman spectroscopy. Montmorillonite clay was used as a representativeof the smectites found in raw and spent shales, and hematite was usedas a representative of iron oxide found in spent shales. Benzene, 2,2,4-trimethylpentane,benzoic acid, sodium benzoate, and pyridine were used as representativesof oil shale process organic wastes. In addition, isopropylamine anddimethyl methylphosphonate, a pesticide model, were studied. A preparationmethods comparison study was performed and established the validity ofthe solid state KBr sample preparation technique upon FTIR spectral quality.The results of this study illustrate the utility of fourier transforminfrared spectroscopic analysis to establish and describe the potentialfor sorption interactions between inorganic and organic phases of oilshale processing wastes. Experimentation with the laser remain systemshows promise for significant contributions in this field of research.43 refs., 3 figs., 6 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
