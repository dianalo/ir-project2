The agreement, signed in Manhattan by U.S. District Judge PierreN. Leval, dismisses the case without costs or attorneys' fees, butdoes not reveal terms of the settlement.   However, it was reported early last month that the InfertilityCenter of New York and its founder, Noel Keane, agreed to pay thecouple $30,000 to $40,000.   Keane, reached Tuesday at his law office in Dearborn, Mich.,said only that ``attorneys' fees would have been much more'' thanhis payment to the couple.   The lawyer for Mrs. Whitehead-Gould, Joel D. Siegal of Newark,N.J., did not return a telephone call Tuesday.   Mrs. Whitehead-Gould and Richard Whitehead, her husband at thetime the contract was signed, had charged in a lawsuit that theInfertility Center and Keane committed fraud in the Baby M contract.   The suit questioned whether Mrs. Whitehead-Gould was properlycounseled before becoming a surrogate mother.   After being accepted by the center, Mrs. Whitehead-Gould signeda contract with a Tenafly, N.J., couple, William and ElizabethStern.   Under the arrangement, Mrs. Whitehead-Gould was to accept$10,000 to become pregnant through artificial insemination withStern's sperm, and then relinquish the baby to the couple.   However, after the baby was delivered, Mrs. Whitehead-Gouldlaunched a long, but ultimately unsuccessful, campaign to keep thebaby girl, now nearly 2 years old and living with the Sterns.</TEXT></DOC>
