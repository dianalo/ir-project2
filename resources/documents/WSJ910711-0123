Butperhaps the best present Mr. Yeltsin received came from hisvice president, Alexander Rutskoi.   Mr. Rutskoi, a liberal Communist Party member and Afghanwar hero who was elected along with Mr. Yeltsin in June,announced he was forming a breakaway political partyguaranteed to siphon off many members from theconservative-led Russian Communist Party. The RussianCommunist Party numbers roughly 10 million out of 16 millionCommunist Party members nationwide.</LP><TEXT>   The new party, named the Democratic Party of RussianCommunists, will throw its support behind Mr. Yeltsin andthus significantly strengthen his chances to push radicalreforms through a Russian parliament sharply divided betweenliberals and conservatives. But not wanting to scare offpotential members from within the Communist Party, the newparty is being coy about whether it is fully independent or,in Mr. Rutskoi's words, a &quot;party within the Communist Party.&quot;Nevertheless, a special congress will be held this month toput the finishing touches on a party program and formallylaunch it, Mr. Rutskoi said.   &quot;Look at the civilized world -- the U.S. president has abase in a party,&quot; said Mr. Rutskoi. &quot;Yeltsin didn't have abase, so we are creating one.&quot; The new party signals an endto ideological control by party arch conservatives, Mr.Rutskoi said. &quot;Fifty percent of {Russian} Communist Partymembers will leave the party and join ours,&quot; said Mr.Rutskoi, who characterized the party as social-democratic.   The new party's leaders hope to attract many rank-and-fileCommunist Party members, former members, and those who havenever belonged to any party. The new party is also supposedto unite with progressive-minded Communist Party members inother republics, and eventually to join with the Movement forDemocratic Reforms, a liberal political organization foundedlast week by former Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze anda Gorbachev adviser, Alexander Yakovlev. Mr. Rutskoi is afounder of the movement.   The new party could serve as the catalyst for a split inthe Communist Party as a whole. Should that occur, onemassive party would break down into two or more, putting themon a more equal footing with other new parties in an emergingmultiparty system. The Communist Party has already renouncedits former monopoly on power, but its present huge size andresources give it an enormous advantage over other parties.   &quot;This will unavoidably lead to a party split,&quot; said Lt.Gen. Dmitri Volkogonov, one of Mr. Yeltsin's closestadvisers. &quot;You have to get rid of the conservatives and Ithink Gorbachev will support this.&quot; Gen. Volkogonov said theend result would be creation of at least two parties, withthe conservative faction of the Communist Party slated for&quot;slow death.&quot;   It isn't clear where a Communist Party split might comefirst, in the Russian Communist Party, whose leaders denounceboth Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Gorbachev and who have scheduled aspecial plenum this month, or in the larger Communist Partyof the Soviet Union, whose Central Committee will also meetthis month. There will be a &quot;fight&quot; at both plenums to &quot;tearaway&quot; members for the new party, said Irina Vinogradova, headof the Communists for Democracy faction inside the Russianparliament and one of the founders of Mr. Rutskoi's newparty.   &quot;This is merely the confirmation of the split {in theCommunist Party} that already exists,&quot; said Fyodr Burlatsky,editor of the liberal weekly Literary Gazette and a member ofthe national parliament. Yuri Aksyutin, a teacher of partyhistory at the Russian Socio-Political Institute, said therift would lead to &quot;the Communist Party dividing up itsmembers and property.&quot;   Some Russian lawmakers criticized the move, saying theywouldn't join. &quot;Right now, the creation of any party in thissociety is impossible,&quot; said Yevgeny Kuznetsov, a member ofthe Republican Party of Russia, formed last year by liberalswho left the Communist Party. &quot;It's utopia andself-deception.&quot; Mr. Kuznetsov said the problem was a lack ofconcrete goals and unity among many politicians.   Sergei Baburin, leader of the conservative Rossiyamovement that backs a strong federal union, said the newparty didn't have the intellectual horsepower to win manybackers and cause a Communist Party split. &quot;Leaders must bebelieved in,&quot; he said, adding that he didn't have much faithin Mr. Rutskoi.   If the new party fails to lure many Communist Partymembers, its fate could resemble that of an earlierinitiative to form a liberal alternative to the SovietCommunist Party. Last summer's hoped-for exodus of partymembers under the banner of the &quot;Democratic Platform&quot; largelyfizzled because of a lack of big-name supporters andindecisiveness among party members. Those who did leaveformed the Republican Party of Russia, which numbers just5,000 members. Some believe that Mr. Rutskoi's new party issimilarly fated.</TEXT></DOC>
