<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-78-0949 </DOCNO><TEXT>Superconductors based on NbTi are now for many years the most widely usedconductors for superconducting magnets. The fabrication technology ofmonofilamentary and multifilamentary conductors in a Cu matrix has reacheda very high standard mainly in conjunction with the applications in analyticalmeasuring techniques (NMR) and in medicine (MRI). Other applicationshave less stringent demands on conductor homogeneity but require highercurrent density and/or finer filaments and highly resistive (CuNi) barriersto reduce magnetization currents or ac losses. In addition, large scaleapplications require cabled conductors some with integrated reinforcementand cooling channels. The specific requirements for the major applicationfields of NMR/MRI, particle accelerator technology, nuclear fusion andpower generators are briefly described. The state of the art of the conductortechnology is described by presenting the parameters and the performanceof conductors produced or developed for recently completed or ongoingprojects. Areas of further research and development are identified.</TEXT></DOC>
