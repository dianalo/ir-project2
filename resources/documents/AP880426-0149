A bipartisan group of 187 House members has written Secretary ofState George P. Shultz opposing the sale of advanced equipment inlight of the Saudis' recent secret purchase of missiles from Chinathat could devastate Israel.   But Charles E. Redman, the State Department spokesman, said theSaudis have offered assurances the missiles would not benuclear-armed.   ``We have not changed our view that the AWACS maintenancepackage is critical to our gulf policy,'' he said. ``The SaudiAWACS operation provides important support for the U.S. mission inthe gulf, including protection of U.S. Navy personnel.''   American warships are protecting Kuwaiti oil tankers, outfittedwith U.S. flags, in the tanker war between Iran and Iraq. A numberof clashes with Iran have resulted.   ``We expect to go forward with the formal notification in thenear term,'' Redman said.   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said 186 other House members hadsigned a letter he wrote urging Secretary of State George P. Shultzto withdraw the proposed sale. The letter was to be forwarded toShultz today after additional signatures were gathered.   Schumer made the announcement Monday after learning the StateDepartment planned to serve notice later that day of the proposedsale, said spokesman Jay Genachowski. Formal notificationsubsequently was postponed, he said.   State Department spokesman Dennis Harter said the administrationhad made no decision on when to formally notify Congress of thearms sales, but that officials were ``doing some consultations'' onthe proposal, ``particularly since there has been some evidence ofcongressional concern.''   Congress has 30 days to pass legislation to block the arms saleonce it is formally announced.   Those signing the letter maintained it would be rewarding Saudideceit to allow such a sale after recent disclosures that theSaudis had secretly purchased medium-range ballistic missiles fromChina.   Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, today decided to sign the nuclearweapons non-proliferation treaty. The decision, as reported by theSaudi Press Agency, is an apparent effort to reassure the UnitedStates that it will not try to arm its CSS-2 missiles with nuclearwarheads.   The decision also could blunt Israel's allegations that themissiles constituted a threat to its safety.   The letter expresses concern that the Saudis ``went to suchlengths to conceal the missile purchase from the United States.''   In a separate letter sent earlier, 58 senators urged Shultz torethink the proposed sale of Bradley fighting vehicles, TOWmissiles and ground support equipment for AWACS early-warningaircraft.   The House members' letter says it is U.S. policy to sustainIsrael's advantage in quality of arms over the advantage in numberspossessed by more heavily populated Arab neighbors.</TEXT></DOC>
