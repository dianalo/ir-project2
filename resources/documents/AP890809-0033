(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Soviets were listening andjournalists had reported for weeks on Columbia's payload, so whydid military and NASA officials go to the trouble of keeping thelaunch time and other details secret?   ``By being inexact about the launch time, it complicates theirability to track,'' Lt. Col. Ron Rand, Air Force spokesman, said ofthe Soviets. ``They may or may not listen in, but we're going to doeverything we can to keep the payload anonymous.''   But scientists who attended Tuesday's launch of the DefenseDepartment's fourth shuttle mission said the military shroud won'tstop the Soviets from finding out all about the reconnaissancesatellite Columbia and its five astronauts are believed to belaunching.   ``There's no reason I can think of for the secrecy,'' said JohnPike, a space analyst with the Federation of American Scientists.``In principle, they could run this countdown like they run everycountdown _ maybe this way it's more fun for them.''   The Soviets will shoot pictures of the satellite even before thedevice begins functioning, said Pike. Soviet cameras attached to atelescope can give a resolution as small as one foot.   ``If they launch the satellite this morning, the Soviets willcertainly know what it looks like by tonight,'' he said Tuesday.   NASA lifted its news blackout only briefly, announcing thelaunch time nine minutes before blastoff and reporting atrouble-free ascent into orbit shortly afterward.   Nevertheless, a Soviet trawler bristling with antennas monitoredthe launch from less than 50 miles off Cape Canaveral. Reporters _and probably the Soviets _ listened in on National Aeronautics andSpace Administration's internal communications channel to followthe countdown.   The Soviet trawler and anyone else with a radar system couldtrack Columbia as soon as it left the launch pad, but NASA refusedto tell reporters where the solid rocket boosters fell, saying thatcould help determine the shuttle's trajectory.   The military clampdown on the mission wasn't airtight, though.   The shuttle crew, which always boards about 2{ hours before thescheduled launch time, was trucked out to the pad in the earlymorning illuminated by a spotlight and accompanied by a helicopterescort as well-wishers waved and camera crews filmed.   Inside the Kennedy Space Center media room, space expertsgenerally agreed the 20,600-pound satellite would spy on the SovietUnion with highly sensitive camera lenses and infrared sensors from300 miles up.   ``If it's a high inclination (on takeoff), it's going overRussia and it's going to do some kind of sensing,'' said HarryKolcum of the magazine Aviation Week andamp; Space Technology, whichoften gives details of secret satellites prior to launch.   Indeed, the shuttle took off on a north-northeast course thatwould take it over Poland, the Soviet Union, Mongolia, China andparts of the Middle East. Non-military shuttle missions normallytake an eastward path.   Besides tracking Columbia's launch, the Soviets will be able tointercept the satellite's emissions, Kolcum said.   The experts also agreed Columbia carried a second small payload_ a 275-pound instrument package apparently intended for use in theStrategic Defense Initiative program, according to Aviation Week.   ``We've been after them for years to change _ there's no reasonwe can think of for keeping it secret,'' Kolcum said.   Although NASA would like shuttle flights to get the maximumamount of publicity, the agency must please the Air Force, whichhas switched some of its launches to unmanned rockets in the wakeof the Challenger disaster.   ``If secrecy's judged by them to be in the nation's interest,I'm for it,'' said J.R. Thompson, deputy administrator of NASA.   The Defense Department's gag on the mission may irk journalistsand some NASA supporters, but the Soviets appear to empathize withthe secrecy.   Asked about the launch of a spy satellite over his territory, aSoviet Embassy press spokesman in Washington said only, ``We don'tcomment on such matters.''</TEXT></DOC>
