Seib (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> EXE </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Reagan's State of the Union address Monday will deal extensively with education and drug abuse, two topics of increasing importance to him. The president also will repeat his traditional themes of fiscal and social conservatism.    The speech represents the formal opening of Mr. Reagan's final year in office, in which a national preoccupation with elections will make it difficult for him to push an ambitious and detailed legislative agenda. So aides have crafted an address designed to focus national attention on a few specific initiatives he considers important while making a general appeal for the conservative ideas he has tried to push in seven years in office.    The speech will reflect the growing interest among both Republicans and Democrats in what Mr. Reagan has been calling &quot;educational excellence,&quot; White House officials say. For example, they say, Mr. Reagan is expected to endorse teacher certification and merit pay for educators, and push again for federal vouchers for parents who send their children to private schools.    Mr. Reagan's education effort also will involve more federal funding. Aides say he plans to call for an increase of about $300 million in the Education Department budget next year over the roughly $20 billion the department is expected to spend in the current fiscal year, which ends in October. Specifically, Mr. Reagan is calling for an increase of more than 50%, to $115 million from $72 million, in funding for &quot;magnet&quot; schools, which offer specialized academic programs.    The fight against drug abuse is another area in which Mr. Reagan will seek increased funding despite concern about the federal deficit, White House officials say. Mr. Reagan is likely to call again for improved drug interdiction programs to stem the flow of drugs into the U.S. But he also is expected to use the speech to shift the focus of national attention from drug suppliers back to drug users and efforts to change their behavior.    President Reagan also is expected to renew his oft-repeated calls for changes in the budget process, such as a balanced-budget amendment, to eliminate the federal deficit.    And he is likely to deliver a new and more impassioned plea for the line-item veto, which would allow the president to knock individual items out of a spending bill without vetoing the entire bill.    Mr. Reagan also is expected to make a strong pitch for additional funding for Nicaragua's Contra rebels. Administration officials have said that, on the day after the State of the Union address, Mr. Reagan will submit to Congress a request for about $50 million in new Contra aid designed to sustain the rebels through July.    In addition, Mr. Reagan is likely to repeat his standard appeals in favor of prayer in schools and curbs on abortions. Though there isn't much chance of pushing such ideas ahead in Congress this year, they are part of the basic Reagan agenda and White House aides say they need to be mentioned to avoid any appearance that the president is backing away from them.    But the Democrats, in their televised response, are expected to proclaim the end of the Reagan era and to assert that the Democratic-controlled Congress will spearhead a new epoch. House Speaker James Wright of Texas and Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd of West Virginia, in a joint address, will try to position the Democrats as a party that is able to govern, a message they consider particularly important in this election year.    They are expected to speak about a need for government that counters the anti-government rhetoric of the Reagan years, to criticize Reaganomics, and to portray the party as the one that will help families. The address will concentrate on domestic issues such as welfare overhaul and education, but will touch on the trade bill and include comments by Mr. Wright opposing military aid for the Contra rebels in Nicaragua. </TEXT></DOC>
