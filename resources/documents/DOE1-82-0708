<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-82-0708 </DOCNO><TEXT>The authors have shown that the expected hydroxymethylation at position3 of the furan ring does not occur in the reaction of 2,5-dimethylfuranwith paraform in acetic acid at 70-80{sup 0}C with the dimethylfuranand paraform in molar ratios of 2:1-1:2, but the products from substitutionin the side chain are formed. By vacuum distillation of the reactionmass the authors isolated 2-(5-methyl-2-furyl)- ethanol and a hygroscopicviscous product melting at 136{sup 0}C (5 mm Hg). The yield of the reactionproducts depends on the molar ratio of the dimethylfuran and paraform.The PMR spectrum of the product contains signals for the {beta}-protonsof the furan ring with chemical shifts of 5.81 and 5.90 ppm, a signalfor the methyl group in the furan ring at 2.22 ppm, a doublet at 3.72ppm with spin-spin coupling constant of 6 Hz, a weak quintet at 3.20ppm with the same constant, and a broadened signal in the region of 4.66ppm for the proton of the hydroxyl group.</TEXT></DOC>
