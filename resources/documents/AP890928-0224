But the cheery poster, plastered up at key points throughout thecity, comes nowhere near reflecting the mood of the country as itobserves its founding on Oct. 7, 1949.   East Germany today is beset by widespread discontent and peoplehave been fleeing by the tens of thousands, even though its economyis the envy of the rest of the East bloc.   ``We need a pluralistic, socialist democracy, and we need itnow,'' said the Rev. Friedrich Schorlemmer, a Lutheran Churchpastor in Wittenberg who calls often for democratic reforms. Hiscomment is more in line with the mood of a growing number oftoday's East Germans.   Challenged by a determined democracy movement, reeling from theexodus to the West and facing apparent disunity within its ownranks, the governing Communist Party will be hard put to give theworld a show of success on its 40th anniversary.   East Germany's problems have drawn attention to the government'svulnerability as an opponent of a democracy mood that has sweptacross other parts of Eastern Europe.   Hard-line Communists have firmly rejected the kind of democraticreforms under way in the Soviet Union, Hungary and Poland.   ``East Germany does not need reform just for the sake of reform.We solve our own problems through the achievements of ourworkers,'' said Otto Reinhold, head of the state-run Academy forSocial Sciences in East Germany.   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union plans to bein East Berlin for the anniversary celebrations. But even thisgesture of camaraderie could serve to remind the East Germanleadership of its troubles.   Gorbachev is well-liked by many East Germans who see his reformsat home as a good example to follow and his presence could nudgeEast Germany's leader, the 77-year-old Erich Honecker, into seeingthe necessity for democratic reforms.   Honecker himself has become a source of speculation,particularly since he underwent a gall bladder operation and tooksix weeks to recover. The illness raised the questions of how muchlonger he would remain in power and who his successor would be.   East German activists say they fear violent demonstrations coulderupt across East Germany if the country's aging, hardlineleadership does not give some hope for change to a people growingincreasingly restless.   The most dramatic manifestation of discontent so far has beenthe exodus of more than 20,000 East German refugees to the Westsince Sept. 11, when Hungary opened its borders for them, bringingthe total for the year so far to at least 100,000.   The vast majority said they left in search of democraticfreedoms and better living conditions.   That, too, is a sentiment among many of the East Germans whohave stayed behind and signed up with new democracy-movement groups.   The most prominent of these groups, the recently banned NeuesForum (New Forum), says it signed up more than 4,000 supporters inabout two weeks.   On Sept. 25, about 8,000 people marched through Leipzigdemanding more democracy and singing ``We Shall Overcome.'' Policearrested about a dozen of them.   The wave of democracy sentiment has produced apparent fissureswithin the Communist Party itself.   Hans Modrow, Communist Party chief for Dresden, indicated hesees a need for change when he said during a recent visit toStuttgart in West Germany that the government in East Berlin shouldthink about the causes of the East German exodus.   But the country's leaders have given no sign of abandoning theiranti-reforms stance.   As the 40th anniversary approached, state-run publications ranarticles emphasizing East Germany's ideological links withCommunist allies from Moscow to Beijing as well as its businessties with the West.   As for the exodus, the East German leadership has charged thatWest Germany lured people away.   The state-run publications also have been portraying EastGermany as a land of hard workers devoted to communism.   The Communist Party Ostsee-Zeitung newspaper recently quoted thesupervisor of a collective farm, Manfred Steller, as saying: ``WhenI look around, then I start to think how much things have changedin the past 20 years. Back then we were hauling sacks out of wagonsby hand. But now we have a huge fleet of transport vehicles. Therehave been some problems along the way, but we've mastered themall.''   Indeed, East Germany has achieved a standard of living that isthe envy of many of its East bloc neighbors. But it remains farbelow West Germany, which sends financial aid, and it still hasenormous problems with air and water pollution, struggles withfrequent shortages of fresh fruits and vegetables and faces aserious lack of building materials and construction labor.   East Germany was officially founded 40 years ago with Sovietbacking. Like West Germany, it was created from the wartime rubbleof Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany.   It quickly became a focal point of the Cold War and in 1961 itsleaders built the Berlin Wall, creating one of the world's starkest_ and deadliest _ symbols of the divisions between East and West.   The wall still stands starkly 40 years after the birth of EastGermany but maybe less deadly.   Honecker said earlier this year border guards had been told notto shoot at escapees anymore _ except in self-defense or to stopdesertions.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Wed AMs, Oct. 4</NOTE></DOC>
