In a study published in this week's New England Journal of Medicine, researchers at the University of Utah said they found strong evidence that about one-third of all white Americans inherits one or more genes that make them highly-susceptible to developing colon and rectal cancers. Those who inherit the genes, the researchers said, are at risk of developing adenomatous polyps, tissue growths that must be present for a cancer to arise.    The Utah study, which was the subject of a page-one article in The Wall Street Journal in early August, buttresses claims by some doctors that close relatives of people with colon and rectal cancers ought to be tested for appearance of polyps. The researchers said the finding means that at least 50%, and perhaps 100%, of all colon and rectal cancers first require inheritance of the gene or genes, but that the cancers arise in only certain individuals because of the presence of some additional unknown factors, such as a certain type of diet.    The research, led by Lisa Cannon-Albright, Mark Skolnick and Randall Burt, found evidence of the genes by conducting colon exams of 670 people in 34 families whose relatives have a history of the cancers. Because the study centered on Utah Mormons, there were no findings concerning racial groups other than whites.    The researchers found that the polyps traveled through the families in a fashion that strongly indicated the presence of a dominant gene, which means that the gene need be inherited from just one parent to be active. The researchers have said they will conduct further studies to find the location and identity of the gene or genes.    In a separate study in the same journal, researchers led by Bert Vogelstein at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine reported evidence that four or five genes must be mutated for a colon or rectal cancer to occur. In the study, the researchers said the mutations involve tiny changes in the chemical structure of normal genes. One of the genes involved is a so-called oncogene that has been associated with other cancers. Another of the genes appears to normally suppress tissue growth, and, the researchers suggest, when it is mutated it allows the kind of growth involved in a cancer.    While the two studies aren't directly related, they both indicate that genetic changes, either spontaneous or inherited, must occur in the two cancers. Dr. Vogelstein has previously stated that the predisposing gene or genes uncovered by the Utah scientists may be similar to one of the genes his group has identified.    In an editorial accompanying the studies, Dr. Peter C. Nowell of the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine said as a result of the new findings an outline is beginning to emerge of the series of genetic events involved in a fully developed human cancer and of the underlying mechanisms. </TEXT></DOC>
