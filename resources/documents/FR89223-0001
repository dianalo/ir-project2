Randall, (202) 632-4634.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The Federal Employees Health BenefitsAmendments Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100-654, was enacted on November 14, 1988.Title III of the Act, which provides health insurance coverage for certaintemporary employees, is effective March 14, 1989. Under Title III, temporaryemployees who have completed 1 year of current continuous employment, excludingany break in service of 5 days or less, are eligible to participate inthe FEHB Program. Title III of the Act also provides that any temporaryemployee who enrolls, based on meeting the eligibility criteria in TitleIII of the Act, must have withheld from his or her pay the full subscriptioncharge. The government will make no contribution to the premium.The amendments to andSection;andSection; 890.102, 890.501, and 890.502 of 5CFR are intended to make those sections conform with provisions of TitleIII of the Act. Section 890.109 is added to exclude from consideration,when determining eligibility for continued coverage during retirement,periods during which temporary employees are eligible under Title III ofthe Act for health benefits. Section 890.109 is intended to provide fairnessto temporary employees, who are precluded from participating in a retirementsystem and may elect not to enroll in the FEHB Program. If they subsequentlyreceive a permanent appointment covered under a retirement system, enrollin the FEHB program, and then retire while enrolled for less than 5 yearsimmediately preceding retirement, they will not be penalized for theirearlier decision not to enroll as a temporary employee. For purposes ofcontinuing enrollment during retirement, such employees' opportunity toenroll would have begun when they received the permanent appointment whichentitled them to participate in a retirement system and also entitled themto receive the government contribution toward their health benefits premiumpayments.The Office of Personnel Management will conduct a special open enrollmentperiod from March 14-April 14, 1989, for employees who meet the eligibilityrequirements of Pub. L. 100-654 on or before March 14, 1989. Employeeswho become eligible to enroll after March 14, 1989, will be treated asany other employee becoming eligible to enroll for the first time. (SeeandSection; 890.301(a) of 5 CFR.) After the special open enrollment period,agencies must notify temporary employees as soon as they become eligibleto enroll and the employees must be given 31 days to register to enroll.The Office of Personnel Management will issue instructions in the FederalPersonnel Manual system about the special open enrollment period and aboutsubsequent enrollments.Under section 553(b)(3)(B) of Title 5, United States Code, I find thatgood cause exists for waiving the general notice of proposed rulemaking.The notice is being waived to provide entitlements clearly conferred byPub. L. 100-654 to affected individuals beginning March 14, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation</ITAG>I have determined that this is not a major rule as defined under section1(b) of E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>I certify that these regulations will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities because they primarily affectFederal employees.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 5 CFR Part 890</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Government employees, Health insurance.<ITAG tagnum="20">U.S. Office of Personnel Management,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Constance Horner, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Director.</ITAG>Accordingly, OPM amends 5 CFR Part 890 as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 890_FEDERAL EMPLOYEES HEALTH BENEFITS PROGRAM</ITAG>1.
