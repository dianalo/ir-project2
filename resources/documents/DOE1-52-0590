The major organicdecomposition product is ethylene glycol. They have found that in thepresence of trace amounts of hydrogen sulfide (H{sub 2}S/sub (aq)/),the transformation of EDB in groundwater is changed. Its degradationis significantly accelerated in dilute solutions containing between 5and 100 ppm H{sub 2}S/sub (aq)/. The EDB half-life is inversely relatedto the H{sub 2}S/sub (aq)/ concentration and is only slightly affectedby pH between 6.5 and 8.5. The major transformation products were identifiedby GC/MS and by GC analyses using electron-capture and flame photometricdetection. All the products detected are saturated rings of one, twoor four ethylene units and two, three of four sulfur atoms. In EDB-contaminatedgroundwater that contains trace amounts of H{sub 2}S/sub (aq)/, the reactionsdescribed should be the contaminant's major mode of transformation. Thefate and distribution of the products resulting are being investigated.</TEXT></DOC>
