Thefreezing rate was controlled from 0.581 to 15.0 mmh{sup -1} under a constantfreezing temperature of -16.5{sup 0} C. Suspended solids were more concentratedat the central region of freezing column by slower freezing rate, andthe produced sludge particles were larger. The dewatering characteristicswere more improved by lower freezing rate except for below 2 mmh{sup-1}. Dissolved organic carbon concentration (DOC) in the liquid increasedimmediately after thawing of frozen sludge, and its increment did notdepend upon freezing rate and remained constant. During standing afterthawing, the amount of organic matter thawed from cells into liquid increasedwith the slower rate of freezing, with the result of increased DOC.
