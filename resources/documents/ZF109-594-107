 Personalcomputer local area network experts, knowledge engineers and computer-aidedsoftware engineering (CASE) gurus are going at a premium.andP;  Triple threatswith expertise in engineering, manufacturing and programming are in demand.andO;There are job openings all around the country that are going begging.andM;Yet, the market for IS professionals nationwide has been dubbed soft byindustry recruiters.andP;  Many companies that are downsizing aren't expandingtheir IS staffs.andP;  They're generally not giving big pay hikes to job-hoppers,and they're loath to pay the escalating costs of relocation.andP;  And, accordingto DATAMATION's new survey of salaries and trends among 166 responses, theymay not be giving existing staff a big enough salary increase this year tocover the costs of inflation, which some economists expect to be 6%, orperhaps higher.andM;These are very mixed signals for IS professionals.andP;  But they have to listencarefully to what those signals are saying.andP;  There is some demand, but thejob descriptions are highly specific and quite often require expertise inseveral technologies or in a combination of technology and business.andP;  Often,knowledge of an industry or of one or more business functions is required.andO;Furthermore, companies are not too willing to settle for less.andP;  either theywon't fill them, or they'll contract the work out if they can.andM;Three factors are important in deciphering these mixed signals:andM;* The current employment down cycle in the market.andM;* The current skills needed--what's hot and what's not.andM;* The long-range technological and business needs of corporations racing tostay ahead of the pack or struggling to maintain competitive parity.andM;Steve Joffe, vice president of nationwide recruiter Source EDP, puts thecurrent market softness into perspective.andP;  &quot;What's going on now is acorrection in the marketplace against the 'run run' of the '83s.andP;  It may lastnine or 18 months, and then there will be another correction.andP;  I don't thinkthere are many computer professionals who are unemployed, but they are doingjobs that are less mobile because of the softening in demand.andP;  Companies arenot going for major expansions of computer staffs.&quot;andP;  For the first time inmore than eight years, he says, this sluggishness extends broadly to Fortune500 companies and banking institutions.andM;DATAMATION's survey generally confirms his assertions.andP;  Overall, theresponding firms said their &quot;DP professional&quot; work force will declineslightly in 1990 by 2.3%.andP;  The biggest cutbacks in this sample are among thetroubled banks (a whopping 35%), DP services (13%) and industrialmanufacturers (10%).andP;  Many small companies (with under $100 million inrevenues) reported 15 to 25% cutbacks, while the largest (with revenues over$3 billion) averaged a 2% decline.andP;  Regionally, respondents in therecession-plagued northeastern metropolitan areas--Boston, New York City andPhiladelphia--plan to downsize by an average of 16 to 20%.andM;But the picture isn't all bleak.andP;  There are firms and regions that either aredoing well or are beginning their ascent from the doldrums and have a pent-updemand for people.andP;  For instance, 7 to 9% staff increases on average areplanned by respondents from the consumer manufacturing, distribution andtransportation/utilities sectors.andP;  Government sites reported a 4% averagehike.andP;  And outside the evidence of our sample, recruiters say that the healthservices sector is actively hiring.andM;Geographically, in the reviving Rust Belt, some Chicago and Detroit firmsreported 20% increases, and there is healthy hiring going on in Houston, SanFrancisco and Washington, D.C.andP;  Source EDP'S Regional director for northernCalifornia, Dave Flansbaum, reports that San Francisco area companies thatsurvived the &quot;feeding frenzy of leveraged buyouts&quot; four years ago, are nowlean, profitable and looking for more IS people than the market can supply.andM;Is It Time To Change Jobs?andM;In such a volatile market, professionals have many concerns.andP;  What are theirprospects in their current companies and locations?andP;  Will it pay to move, orshould they sit tight?andP;  First, within their companies, according to theDATAMATION survey, the average increase in salaries is 5.6% in 1990, equal tolast year's but less than the 6.6% increase of 1988 and the 6.2% rise of1987.andP;  This generally holds true across industries and across the country,with the exception of banking and government sectors, which are giving lessthan 5%.andP;  Inflationary trends, fueled by the crisis in the Middle East, mayresult in the cost of living going to 7% in 1990.andP;  The result: a net incomeloss.andM;So, when inflation and other economic factors are taken into account, thesurvey indicates that the average salaries of middle management and theirstaffs have not changed appreciably from last year.andP;  Flansbaum at Source EDPconfirms this and adds a troubling note.andP;  &quot;The salary levels for first-andsecond-line managers are pretty stagnant.andP;  But what's happening is that thetechnical people, who have been receiving increases, are compressing upagainst those management levels.andP;  Somewhere in the universe, it's etched instone that managers must make more than people who report to them.&quot;andP;  Theresult is that some companies, because they can't make adjustments in salaryadministration, have been hiring consultants, paying them several times whatan employee would cost.andP;  &quot;This is false economy,&quot; Flansbaum says, adding thatit's time that companies alter their salary structures.andM;The survey indicates a general cutback of 10% in part-time and contractualpersonnel, but Joffe insists: &quot;You won't get that data from surveys, becausea lot of these people are being brokered independently.&quot;andM;So, many in-house professionals are faced with a stagnant income andcompetition from well-paid consultants.andP;  It's also not clear whether they arealways receiving the training to keep up with changing demands.andP;  Recruitersmaintain that training programs generally have not been cut, but neither havethey increased.andP;  Past DATAMATION surveys have indicated an average of about$3,000 spent on training per IS employee.andP;  That was true this year, but theaverage number of hours has declined somewhat from 65 hours in 1988 to 59hours this year.andM;Hiring PracticesandM;A buyer's job market has a variety of characteristics.andP;  Joffe and otherSource EDP recruiters say that firms are typically paying less for theaverage new hire--a 10% raise compared with 20% in better times, lowerbonuses and other incentives and less coverage, if any, of relocation costs.andM;Another characteristic of the buyer's market is the demand for individualswith highly specific skill sets.andP;  Joffe says that firms typically want anindividual to fill 80 to 90% of the job profile so that they can avoid thecosts of training and realize optimum productivity almost instantly.andM;John J. Davis, principal of executive search firm John J. Davis andamp; AssociatesInc. in New York City, says the chief information officer or vice presidentof information systems is in demand because he or she is &quot;someone with thebig picture, experienced in strategic direction setting and in guiding theimplementation of integrated systems to support revamped business processes.&quot;andO;He finds there is no shortage of capable executives among the country'sveterans who have spent their lives in information systems.andP;  And he believesmany of them &quot;can step into general management roles without difficulty.&quot;andO;Six-figure salary packages are common for such talent, says Davis, notingthat even in this market firms continue to offer a 25% premium to attractthem as well as assurances of 15 to 20% in annual increases.andM;In this market, most companies, however, are looking for a &quot;zero learningcurve among their top and upper middle managers,&quot; says Davis, explaining thatindustry experience has become a requirement.andP;  &quot;There is a desperate need forcredibility in this highly competitive environment,&quot; he says, such as the ISexecutive for a retailer &quot;who can talk to merchants as if he or she has knownthem for a lifetime.&quot;andM;Beyond the CIO, there are other upper echelon jobs going for $90,000 and overin larger firms.andP;  These, according to Davis, include:andM;* The database expert &quot;not only skilled in logical and physical modeling&quot; butalso able &quot;to reduce the technology to understandable business terms and totalk to the business issues which technology is supporting.&quot;andM;* The technology architect, the long-range planner for all information andcommunications technologies, &quot;who can optimize the dollars spent ontechnology while optimizing the service delivered to end users.&quot;andM;* The expert in computer and communications security and risk management.andM;* The telecommunications manager knowledgeable about the complexities ofplanning voice and data networks and experienced in purchasing the rightequipment and services in a deregulated environment.andM;The Hybrid ProfessionalandM;The need for people who combine technical and business knowledge has beencascading down into middle management and professional ranks.andP;  These includethe systems analyst with expertise in marketing, manufacturing or otherfunctions and the project leader adept at working with cross-functionalteams.andM;Forrest Jerome, director of product development systems at New YorkCity-based Colgate-Palmolive Co., feels &quot;the days of the pure programmer oranalyst are gone.&quot;andP;  For instance, he needs experts to develop integratedplant-floor systems--people who combine programming, engineering andprocess-control manufacturing knowledge.andM;Corporatewide, he says, &quot;we need to support desktop devices--the PCs andMacs--in ways we didn't think about when they first started moving throughoutthe organization.andP;  We want people who not only can program on the Mac, usingPASCAL or Fourth Dimension, but also have the experience in the type ofPC-based LANs we're implementing and the ability to work with the users as areal member of the team.andP;  They have to understand what is going on in abusiness sense, participate in project teams with the user, and come back andtranslate their demands into code.andP;  That's a reach we haven't had before.&quot;andM;That's the point--as technology becomes more common in business,multitalented staffers are needed to make sure the technology has a truebusiness impact.andP;  John Alexander, senior vice president and CIO at insurancefirm UNUM Life Insurance Co. in Portland, Maine, points out that in-housetraining programs are filling the need for junior programmers and analysts.andO;But he's been looking for people with such leading-edge skills as&quot;knowledge-based systems, image processing and early stage cooperativedistributed data experience in the PC LAN arena.&quot;andP;  His firm isn't just hiringheatseekers; it's building the capability to raise customer service andcorporate performance to new levels.andM;He foresees a high demand for two new breeds of professional.andP;  One is &quot;theworkstation guru, who understands how to build applications that start with agraphical user interface and include a distributed data element.&quot;andP;  Theapplication is partly done on the micro and partly in the mainframe or LANserver; or, in business terms, partly done in the branch, agent or brokeroffice and partly done in the home office.andP;  With such an application, &quot;oneperson fills out the insurance application, another does underwriting, andthey are working from the same set of information,&quot; he says.andM;Another new breed is the person adept at integrating image processing,knowledge-based systems and conventional production data processing intoeither mainframe or micro-level applications.andP;  What this can mean in abusiness sense is illustrated by a multimedia, multifunctional applicationadvertised by Wang Laboratories Inc. in Lowell, Mass., for property andcasualty insurance.andP;  With this application, the various decision makersinvolved in a claim, wherever they are located, can display a photo of thedamage, say to a car fender, call up the image of the customer's originalclaim forms and then, using a decision support process, rule on the claim andprocess it.andM;Companies are now committed to computer-aided software engineering and arelooking for gurus who can both install the products and train applicationdevelopers.andP;  In the mainframe arena, they want skills in current on-line anddatabase systems, plus specific applications experience.andP;  In LANs, they needthe expert who can select, install and support these networks, as well as LANadministrators.andP;  A new requirement is for microanalysts and programmers whocan develop conventional business applications in a multimicro environment.andM;Some, like Joffe, believe that the rise of the technically savvy end user ofthe micro and the operational simplicity of powerful new systems such asIBM's AS/400 will slash the need for many IS professionals.andP;  But theincreasing complexity involved in the integration of technologies andapplications is creating new demand and new opportunity in this field.andM;So, Joffe believes, this is actually a good time for talented people to belooking for a job because many of the companies able to hire are those doingwell.andP;  But, he advises, &quot;Avoid the company looking to fill a need for theshort term.andP;  Make sure the organization has a good long-range plan forinformation systems and network development and can offer a good careerpath.&quot;andP;  Again, the premiums for job-hopping &quot;are not that great, so don'tmove for money alone unless you have a very hot skill, and you have not beenpaid exceptionally well where you are.&quot;andM;The ultimate word of advice for the IS professional is optimize.andP;  Optimizeyour income by optimizing skills that will optimize the business of theemployer.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
