State officials said the 1,100-acre stretch of track from Miami to West Palm Beach will accommodate a new commuter rail system, and may be used as part of a proposed cross-state, high-speed railway linking Miami and Tampa.    CSX, a transportation and natural resources concern based in Richmond, Va., said Florida paid $75 million of the purchase price immediately; the remainder will be paid in installments over a period of about 10 years.    State Transportation Secretary Kaye N. Henderson said the significance of the purchase to south Florida transportation &quot;is beyond price.&quot;    The state's near-term goal is to ease traffic congestion caused by planned improvements to Interstate 95, which parallels the corridor. Officials hope to begin operation of a commuter train system by late this year, financed by state and federal funds. It may also form part of a highspeed rail line currently under consideration by private investors, an official said.    Under the terms of the agreement, CSX will pay a monthly rental fee of about $100,000 to run its freight trains through the corridor, a company official said. Amtrak will also be able to operate passenger trains through it. </TEXT></DOC>
