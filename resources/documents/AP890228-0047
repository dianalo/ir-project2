A police spokesman said the casualties were reported in thevillage of Ainab, 10 miles southeast of Beirut. He said the deadguerrillas were members of Naif Hawatmeh's Democratic Front for theLiberation of Palestine, a Marxist PLO faction.   The spokesman, who cannot be named under police regulations, saidthe children were wounded by shrapnel and flying glass in Ainab'selementary school, about 200 yards from the base of the guerrillagroup.   He said a rocket fired by one of six Israeli jets slammed into anempty lot about 25 yards south of the school.   The police spokesman said the jets also strafed bases belongingto Syrian-backed guerrilla factions near the Druse villages ofShemlan, Aitat and Bayssour. Those targets are about eight milessoutheast of Beirut.   Democratic Front spokesman Suheil Natour said the group's base inAinab ``took several direct hits.''   He said the front ``stresses its determination to step up thestruggle and military strikes against Israeli occupation forces.''   U.S. State Department spokesman Charles Redman said Monday thatDemocratic Front raids ``have a negative impact'' on the dialoguebetween Washington and the Palestine Liberation Organization.   The six Israeli fighter-bombers staged at least three bomb androcket attacks in 30 minutes, police said.   An Israeli military spokesman said in Jerusalem that the raid wasdirected against a command headquarters of the Democratic Front andthat all the jets returned safely after destroying their targets.   Palestinian, Druse and Shiite Moslem militia gunners firedanti-aircraft guns at the raiding planes from positions in themountains and around Beirut International Airport, but no hits werereported, police said.   Air traffic was brought to a standstill at the airport during theraid, Israel's third on Lebanon this year, the police spokesman said.   The Israeli said the air raid's target was used as headquartersfor guerrillas and as a point for organizing and launching attacksagainst Israel and against Israeli targets in Israel'sself-proclaimed security zone in south Lebanon.   The air strike coincided with the 20th anniversary of theestablishment of the Democratic Front, which lost three guerrillasin a confrontation with Israeli-allied militiamen in south Lebanonon Thursday.   An Israeli Foreign Ministry official said Thursday's attack was``another example of the inability of the PLO to fulfill itsdeclared statement of stopping terror.''   PLO chief Yasser Arafat denounced terrorism during a meeting ofthe Palestine National Council in November. The PLO maintains thedenunciation does not cover guerrilla attacks against Israelimilitary targets.   At least 128 people were killed and 356 wounded in 25 israeli airraids on Lebanon last year.</TEXT></DOC>
