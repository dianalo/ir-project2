Eastern's unsecured creditors were expected to continue pressingtheir case today for a trustee to run the company. U.S. BankruptcyJudge Burton R. Lifland, meanwhile, indicated at a hearing Mondayhe did not favor a liquidation of the airline.   Alan Boyd, chairman of the unsecured creditors' committee, citedEastern's continuing financial losses and what he calledmanagement's inability to forecast results with ``anything close toreality.''   Boyd, chairman of Airbus Industrie of North America, also saidat Monday's hearing that Eastern's management had shown itselfunable to regain the confidence of the flying public and travelagents since a devastating strike more than a year ago.   Airbus, the jet maker owned by a consortium of European nations,is one of Eastern's major suppliers and is owed roughly $100million by the airline.   The creditors' committee wants Lifland to appoint a specialtrustee to take over the management of Eastern in place of FrankLorenzo, chairman of Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp. Eastern'smanagement said appointment of a trustee would doom the airline.   The hearing began with a lengthy session last Friday. Easternalso is asking the judge for permission to withdraw $80 millionfrom an escrow account to cover second-quarter operations.   Lorenzo and Eastern President Phil Bakes are expected to testifyfor the company today or later in the week as the hearing continues.   Eastern has been attempting to reorganize under bankruptcy courtprotection from creditors, but several attempted restructuringplans either have failed to win creditor approval or have fallenthrough.   Boyd said creditors objected, among other things, to Eastern'sproposal to sell its maintenance facility in Miami for about $100million because they believed it would remove an integral part ofEastern's operations.   Boyd said the committee, which had been supportive of Eastern'sprevious reorganization proposals, began to change its attitudeearly this year when the airline proposed cutting debt payments tocreditors.   The committee lost confidence after Eastern said on March 27that it no longer could honor an earlier proposal to repayunsecured creditors 50 cents for every dollar owed, Boyd said.   The same day, the unsecured creditors passed a resolution toseek a trustee to liquidate Eastern if Texas Air didn't agree tocover the company's losses. Since then, the committee has shiftedand said it wants a trustee either to sell the airline as a goingconcern or in parts.   Eastern owes the creditors around $980 million. Preferredshareholders _ who still are seeking to liquidate the airine _ aredue $680 million.   Bruce Zirinsky, an attorney for Eastern, warned Monday thatappointment of a trustee would be ``one more step'' toward theliquidation of Eastern, which he said could have serious financialconsequences to creditors.   However, Lifland responded that if a trustee were appointed tooperate Eastern, it would be someone in the airline industry.   A travel agent, appearing as a witness for Eastern, warned thatthe airline would lose business if a trustee were designated to runit.   ``The word trustee would be equated with liquidation and I, forone, would book away from Eastern,'' said Richard Copeland,president of the New York chapter of the American Society of TravelAgents and the head of Hillside Travel Inc. in New York.   The pilots, Machinists and flight attendants unions struckEastern on March 4, 1989, forcing the Miami-based airline intobankruptcy protection five days later. The Machinists union remainson strike.   The unions have sought a trustee almost from the outset. Theyclaim Lorenzo has been bleeding Eastern by funneling assets toTexas Air and to Continental Airlines, Eastern's largely non-unionsister carrier.   A report by court-appointed examiner David I. Shapiro filed inearly March suggested Texas Air had victimized Eastern byunderpaying for the airline and some of its assets by hundreds ofmillions of dollars.</TEXT></DOC>
