But it has done much to feed the mystery thatsurrounds her.   Is she the fragile defendant who breaks down at thewitness table, unable to go on? Or is she the indefatigable&quot;Madame&quot; who leads her entourage through shopping sprees attiny Philippine stores in New York? Is she the quiet, forlornwidow in mourning -- or the entertainer who belts outrequests to shouts of &quot;More] More]&quot; at a party celebratingwhat would have been her 36th anniversary?</LP><TEXT>   And, more to the point in the case, did she plunder thePhilippines of more than $200 million and illegally use themoney to buy up jewelry, art and real estate in the U.S.?   Closing arguments in the trial will begin Monday, and theoften-bizarre case is expected to go to the jury around theend of June.   The federal prosecutors handling the case have presented,through charts, documents and nearly 100 witnesses, a largelycircumstantial picture of alleged theft and fraud. But nobodyhas testified that they saw Mrs. Marcos's hand in the cookiejar.   Instead, Philippine bank officials and people involved inthe real estate investments have said it was merely theirunderstanding that the purchases were done at Mrs. Marcos'sbidding. Prosecutors claim that Mrs. Marcos knew that themoney used in the purchases was stolen.   Meanwhile, defense attorney Gerry Spence, a flamboyantWyomian whose Western-style dress and country-lawyer demeanorhave stood out in the Manhattan courtroom, has tried to showthat Mrs. Marcos knew little about the way the money wasbeing invested.   Moreover, Mr. Spence has maintained that the source of theMarcoses' wealth can easily be accounted for, not by theft,but by Mr. Marcos's discovery of an extraordinary gold hoardsupposedly hidden in the Philippines by a Japanese generalduring World War II.   So far, the 11-week trial has been interrupted four timesby Mrs. Marcos's ailments. More recently, Judge John Keenanrecessed the trial for an early lunch last week when mentionof a purchase of Nautilus weight-lifting equipment for herdaughter Imee, allegedly with government money, sent Mrs.Marcos's blood pressure soaring.   &quot;I'm so sorry,&quot; she told her attorneys, through tears, asshe went to her personal nurse, waiting with a stethoscope.Benjamin Cassiday III, one of her attorneys, later explained:&quot;There they are, talking about her kid's Nautilus equipment,and all that . . . and it's very upsetting to her.&quot;   On trial with Mrs. Marcos is Adnan Khashoggi, accused ofhelping her conceal ownership of the Manhattan real estate.Mr. Khashoggi's lawyer, James Linn, conceded that his clientwas in close contact with the Marcoses after they fled to theU.S. in 1986. But Mr. Linn said the dealings had nothing todo with real estate -- instead, he was trying to find a safeport for a shipment of gold owned by Mr. Marcos, in returnfor a share of it.   Although Mr. Linn has poked fun at his client for fallingfor what sounds like such an incredible story, it may not beas absurd as it seems. During a New York visit, PhilippineSolicitor General Francisco Chaves said investigators believethey have tracked down the ship, although the gold wasalready unloaded. He said President Corazon Aquino'sgovernment is now trying to find the gold, which it maintainswas stolen.   Mrs. Marcos's comments and behavior have added to thetrial's bizarre side. Still in mourning for her husband,Ferdinand, who died in September, Mrs. Marcos wears onlyblack clothes, simple jewelry and an unimpressive selectionof black shoes.   &quot;I am the center of the crucifixion,&quot; she reportedly saidto a group of Filipinos in the courtroom around Lent. Onanother day, during a break after a former banker testifiedthat Mrs. Marcos summoned him into her bedroom to discussmoney, she laughed as she told two visitors in the gallery:&quot;He's going into my bedroom -- Ferdinand must be jealous ashell]&quot;   In court, her attorney, Mr. Spence, has generated his owncontroversy. The 61-year-old lawyer has clashed with JudgeKeenan regularly for asking improper questions of witnessesand trying to introduce irrelevant issues. Mr. Spence hasbecome increasingly sensitive about reactions to his conduct.After a reprimand from the judge, he met in chambers withJudge Keenan and complained that people were laughing at him&quot;on the Aquino side of the courtroom.&quot; Mr. Spence, who wearsa rattlesnake-skin belt and western jackets -- but no suits-- said the judge was giving the jury the impression that hewas &quot;just a B.S. guy.&quot; The judge replied that he was takingthe matter too personally.   Mrs. Marcos created a more private stir at a party markingwhat would have been her 36th wedding anniversary. At thesurprise party, reported in a local Philippine newspaper'sgossip column, Mrs. Marcos was also given a letter from herhusband, Ferdinand. The card -- which read: &quot;To Imelda,beyond death, I love you, Andy,&quot; signed with his nickname --was written before he died and was kept secret from Mrs.Marcos.   The main event, however, was a performance by Mrs. Marcos,who took the microphone to sing &quot;Feelings&quot; and &quot;Don't FenceMe In.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
