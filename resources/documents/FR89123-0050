Early commercial aircraft had very little equipmentredundancy beyond that necessary to meet the existing Civil Aviation Regulations(CAR) basic type certification requirements. Prior to adoption of specificprovisions in the CAR operating rules, operation with inoperative equipmentwas prohibited. The concept of the Minimum Equipment List (MEL) presently embodied in Part121 was first developed for air carrier and commercial operators of largeaircraft in 1953 (then CAR 40 and 41) when it was recognized that a flightor series of flights might be continued with certain inoperable instrumentsand equipment under appropriate circumstances. This concept was establishedfollowing the determination of the Civil Aeronautics Agency (CAA) thatstrict observance of the requirement to delay or postpone a flight withan inoperative equipment was an undue hardship and that strict compliancewas not necessary to maintain the type certification level of safety. In1956, the CAR's were further updated to outline the circumstances whenprocedures for limited operations beyond a terminal point with inoperativerequired equipment might be incorporated and authorized in air carriermanuals. The air carrier operating rules of the CAR were recodified effective April1, 1965. Part 121 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR), which replacedCAR 40, 41, and 42, was initiated to regulate the certification and operationsof air carriers and commercial operators of large aircraft. The preambleto Part 121 indicates the intent to carry over procedures for operatingwith inoperative equipment, as they existed in CAR 40 and 41, intact inthe recodification and introduced the term ``minimum equipment list.''To date there have been no substantive amendments to the Part 121 MEL procedures.Historically, the MEL process has been an effective mechanism to permitcontinued flight with instruments and equipment inoperative. It allowsoperational flexibility and a higher degree of schedule reliability whilestill maintaining the level of safety required by the type certificationrules. Evolutionary improvements in both aircraft design and in safety requirementshave provided modern aircraft with the capability for operation over awide range of environmental conditions. These improvements also have providedimproved convenience for both the operator and passengers. Certain installedequipment is required to operate in specific environmental conditions.This equipment is not essential for safe operations provided the kind ofoperation necessitating the equipment is avoided; for example, certainlights are not essential during daytime operations. Other non-requiredoptional equipment (such as entertainment systems, logo lights, and galleyequipment) may be installed for the convenience of the operator or passengers.The MEL is a practical method of enhancing air carrier dispatch reliabilitywhere equipment and accessories not required for type certification areinvolved. Also, experience has shown that given individual aircraft designs,operation of every system or component may not be necessary when the remainingoperative equipment can provide the required level of safety. Section 121.627(c)provides that the Minimum Equipment List and procedures for continuingflight beyond a terminal point with equipment required by andSection; 121.303(d)inoperative may be included in the certificate holder's manual if the Administratorfinds that, in a particular situation, literal compliance with those equipmentrequirements is not necessary in the interests of safety. Although it wouldbe desirable to maintain the aircraft at all times with installed equipmentoperative, it is possible under controlled conditions to maintain the requiredlevel of safety with specific items of equipment inoperative until repairsare available or feasible. A Master Minimum Equipment List (MMEL) for a particular aircraft type isdeveloped by the FAA along with the holder of the type certificate forthat aircraft. The MMEL is the basis for development of an individual operator'sMEL which takes into consideration the operator's particular aircraft equipmentconfiguration and operational conditions. The individual operator's MEL,when approved and authorized by the FAA air carrier certificate holdingdistrict office, allows relief from the maintenance and operating rulesthat require every item of equipment or instrument installed in the aircraftto be operable. The intent of this process is to improve aircraft utilizationand thereby provide more covenient and economic air transportation forthe public. On September 16, 1981, the FAA issued Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM)No. 81-14 (46 FR 52278; October 26, 1981). This notice proposed to consolidateMEL requirements that were contained in Parts 121, 125, and 135 into Part91. It also proposed regulatory changes to permit the operation of generalaviation aircraft (for which an MMEL has not been developed) with certaininoperative instruments and equipment that are not essential for the safeoperation of the aircraft through an approved aircraft flight manual oroperating limitations statement. Due to concerns and objections expressedby the general aviation community, the FAA decided that the notice neededfurther changes. Subsequent to the publication of NPRM No. 81-14, the FAAdetermined that although the rules concerning MEL requirements should bestandardized, Parts 121, 125, and 135 should each contain a separate referenceto MEL requirements. The proposed amendment would standardize application of the MEL conceptby bringing Part 121 in line with Parts 125 and 135 which contain detailedrequirements concerning the MEL. As a result of this standardization, implementationand enforcement of the MEL concept would be more consistent for all operatorsin air transportation. Additionally, the proposal requires amendment ofindividual operator's operations specifications to authorize the use ofan MEL, if that operator elects to use an MEL. The inclusion of the MELauthorization in the operations specifications eliminates the need forthe letter of authorization currently required in Parts 125 and 135. <ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Proposals</ITAG>Section 121.627(c) contains the only Part 121 reference to MEL. This rulepermits an MEL to be included in the certificate holder's manual. Thissimple statement has fostered numerous questions within the air carrierindustry and, therefore, needs to be clarified. The FAA proposes to amendandSection; 121.627 by deleting paragraph (c) and by adding a new andSection;121.628, which would set forth specific requirements for an MEL. As a result,the current andSection; 121.303(d) will be revised by deleting referenceto andSection; 121.627(c) and referring instead to the new andSection; 121.628.The FAA also proposes to amend the language of andSection;andSection; 135.179and 125.201 to make them essentially the same as andSection; 121.628. TheFAA proposes to eliminate the need for the letter of authorization currentlyrequired by andSection;andSection; 125.201(b)(2) and 135.179(b)(2). Instead,the authorization to operate in accordance with an FAA approved MEL willbe contained in the certificate holder's operations specifications. ProposedandSection;andSection; 121.628(a)(2), 125.201(a)(2), and 135.179(a)(2) wouldrequire that an operations specifications authorization be obtained andwould also require either that the MEL be carried aboard the aircraft orthat the flight crew have access to all information contained in the MELprior to and during flight.It is not the FAA's intention to require that the actual MEL be carriedaboard the aircraft, although this would be an acceptable means of compliance.The FAA may accept any method which allows the information contained inthe MEL to be ``directly'' accessible to the flightcrew at all times priorto and during flight. This could be accomplished through a state-of-the-artinformation retrieval system. Furthermore, the FAA does not intend forthe pilot to have access by ``indirect'' means such as conversations andmaintenance personnel over the aircraft radio.These proposals are being made to clarify the extent to which MELs canpermit operation with inoperative equipment. Since the purpose of an MELis to allow an aircraft to be dispatched with certain inoperative equipment,the proposal would reduce ambiguity and, at the same time, standardizeand clarify the FARs. Finally, these proposals will standardize the languageof Parts 121, 125, and 135 to clarify the intent of the Minimum EquipmentList, provide a uniform application of Minimum Equipment List throughoutindustry, and establish that configurations approved through the properuse of a Minimum Equipment List constitute an approved change to the typedesign.The current andSection; 135.179 limits the use of an MEL to multiengine aircraft.Since the rule is silent concerning single-engine aircraft, those aircraftmust have all instruments and equipment operative. Strict observance ofthe requirment to delay or postpone a flight with certain equipment inoperativecreates an unnecessary economic burden for operators of single-engine aircraftin air transportation and strict compliance is not necessary to maintainthe required level of safety. The proposed changes to Part 135 will allowfor the use of an MEL by any civil aircraft, including single-engine aircraft.With respect to the length of time an aircraft may be operated with inoperativeinstruments or equipment, it should be noted that the FAA has implementedprocedures which categorize items of equipment and place a fixed ``timeto repair'' requirement on items within a category. These procedures arecontained in the individual air carrier's operations specifications. The``time to repair'' requirement is currently being implemented for air carriersoperating under Part 121 although it is anticipated that the same requirementswill be effected in the future for Part 125 and 135. Implementation ofthe ``time to repair'' requirement is being carried out independently ofthis rulemaking project.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Evaluation Summary</ITAG>BenefitsThe benefits of these proposed rule changes are nonquantifiable becausethey primarily would reorganize and standardize the MEL provisions of variousoperating rules to clarify and explain the intent of existing requirements.Further, to the extent that their single-engine aircraft could operateusing an MEL, Part 135 operators would benefit from the greater flexibilityand efficiency in the utilization of these aircraft that would be allowedunder the proposed rules, and their passengers and shippers would avoidunnecessary delays and inconveniences as well. Additionally, the use ofoperations specifications in lieu of letters of authorization, in the longrun, should result in a consolidation of administrative burdens for boththe FAA and the air carriers. This should work to reduce administrativecosts. The FAA, however, has no precise basis on which to quantify thesebenefits, since it cannot predict the extent to which Part 135 operatorsof single-engine aircraft will elect to use MELs.CostsOperators subject to the proposed rule change would not incur any compliancecosts because the proposals would only change the format in which MEL authorizationsare granted. The substantive provisions of the MEL's for individual operatorswould continue to be determined by the FAA flight standards field officeshaving jurisdiction over the particular operators, and policy guidancefor specific MEL operating privileges and limitations would continue tobe disseminated through nonregulatory channels, such as the Advisory Circularsystem. The FAA would incur some minor administrative costs in transferringMEL requirements from letters of authorization to operations specifications,but this would be a one-time expense and is in the nature of an ordinarycost of doing business for a regulatory agency. Moreover, the use of operationsspecifications should, in the long run, tend to ease administrative burdensand reduce costs for both the FAA and the carriers.International Trade Impact AssessmentThe proposed regulations would clarify and standardize existing MEL requirementsfor various classes of United States operators, and as such, would haveno effect on the sale of foreign aviation products or services in the UnitedStates, nor would they affect the sale of United States aviation productsor services in foreign countries.Regulatory Flexibility DeterminationThe Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress toensure that small entities are not unnecessarily and disproportionatelyburdened by government regulations. Small entities are independently ownedand operated by small businesses and small not-for-profit organizations.The RFA requires agencies to review rules that may have ``a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' FAA Order2100.14A, <T3>Regulatory Flexibility Criteria and Guidance, </T3>establishes thresholdcost values and small entity size standards for complying with RFA reviewrequirements in FAA rulemaking actions.The small entities potentially affected by the proposed rule changes arethose Part 121, 125, and 135 operators that own nine or fewer aircraft.However, because these proposals would not impose any compliance costson affected operators, and would provide relief in the case of Part 135operators of single-engine aircraft, none of the threshold cost valuesstipulated in Order 2100.14A are expected to be exceeded by any operator.Therefore, the FAA has determined that these proposals would not have asignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities,and a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required under the terms ofthe RFA.Federalism Implications The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effectson the states, on the relationship between the national government andthe states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.Conclusion For the reasons discussed in the preamble, and based on the findings inthe Regulatory Flexibility Determination and the International Trade ImpactAnalysis, the FAA has determined that this proposed regulation is not majorunder Executive Order 12291. In addition, this proposal, if adopted, willnot have significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantialnumber of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory FlexibilityAct. This proposal is considered significant under DOT Regulatory Policiesand Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). An initial evaluationof the proposal, including a Regulatory Flexibility Determination and TradeImpact Analysis, has been placed in the docket.
