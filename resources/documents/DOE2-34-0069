<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-34-0069 </DOCNO><TEXT>Extensive X-band EPR measurements have been carried out on Gd/sup 3+/-dopedsingle crystals of LiY/sub 1-//sub x/Yb/sub x/F{sub 4} (x = 0.0, 0.1,0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0), covering the temperature range 4.2--290K. The spin-Hamiltonian parameters (SHP) are evaluated by the use ofa rigorous least-squares fitting procedure. The systematics of the SHPare studied both as functions of x and of temperature. Newman's superpositionmodel has been applied to the calculation of SHP; it is found that thecalculated values agree quite well with the experimental values, providedthat one considers minor distortions of the positions of the eight fluorineions surrounding the Gd/sup 3+/ ion. The temperature variation of SHPhas been explained to be predominantly due to spin-phonon interactionand partially due to thermal expansion of the crystal lattice. Finally,the average Gd/sup 3+/-Yb/sup 3+/ exchange interaction, averaged overthe nearest and next-nearest neighbors, has been estimated, in LiY/sub0.9/Yb/sub 0.1/F{sub 4}, to be 3.8 +- 2.5 GHz, as found by the applicationof the molecular-field model using the g shift from the isostructuraldiamagnetic host, LiYF{sub 4}, at liquid-helium temperature.</TEXT></DOC>
