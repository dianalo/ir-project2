The New York-based tobacco, food and beverage concern said net income rose to $502 million, or $2.11 a share, from $414 million, or $1.74 a share. Revenue rose 8.9% to $6.97 billion from $6.39 billion.    The third-quarter results included the pretax charge of $117 million for restructuring, which was partially offset by a pretax gain of $46 million from the sale of a barbecue sauce business. Together, the items reduced net income for the quarter by $22 million, or nine cents a share. </TEXT></DOC>
