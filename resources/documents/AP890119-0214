Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio, said Thursdaythat Syrian President Hafez Assad has made a firm commitment to herto work for the release of the nine American hostages held inLebanon.   Oakar, who met with Assad for more than four hours in Damascus,Syria, on Jan. 9, said in an interview that Assad was ``verypositive in saying that he would help'' in the hostage situation.   Oakar's comments came as President Reagan told reporters a daybefore leaving office that he was frustrated by his inability tofree the Americans in war-torn Lebanon.   ``We don't know where they are,'' Reagan said, adding officialsare working ``quietly and privately'' to win freedom for thehostages.   Oakar said she raised the case of Terry Anderson, a hostage sinceMarch 1985. Anderson, an Associated Press correspondent in Lebanonwhen he was kidnapped and the longest-held hostage, is a native ofLorain, Ohio, which is near Oakar's Cleveland district.   During a trip to the Middle East, Oakar arranged the wide-rangingsession with Assad. Also attending the meeting were Sen. ArlenSpecter, R-Pa., and Edward Djerejian, the U.S. ambassador to Syria.Specter's office said he was attending inaugural events and couldnot be reached for comment immediately.   But Oakar, who has an Arab-American heritage, said she waspleased with the reaction from Assad when the discussion turned tothe plight of Anderson.   ``I felt that he was extremely firm in his commitment to helpTerry,'' she said. Reading from her notes on the meeting, Oakarquoted Assad as saying, ``I want to say to the family that I willhelp.''   The hostages are thought to be held by pro-Iranian militants inthe southern suburbs of Beirut. Syria considers itself the mainpower broker in Lebanon, though fighting between rival militias hasput pressure on Syria's ability to influence events over the lastfew months.   The prospect of a Syrian-sponsored settlement in Lebanon, acountry where Moslems and Christians have fought for 13 years, isnot considered bright in the near future.   Oakar said Assad did not provide any details about how he mightwork for the hostages' freedom. However, he said he viewed thehostages as a humanitarian issue rather than a political issue.   The Syrian leader said the ``whole hostage question is a humanquestion,'' Oakar said.   But Assad is obviously a player in the region, Oakar said. ``Hecould use his influence. ... He obviously has occasions fordialogue,'' she said.   She said Assad stressed the hostages were a sensitive issue andhe would avoid doing anything that might harm them.</TEXT></DOC>
