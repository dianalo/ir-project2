Western Life, a Minnesota corporation, established Account C pursuantto the insurance laws of Minnesota as a segregated investment account forthe purpose of funding variable life insurance policies. Account C is registeredwith the Commission as a unit investment trust under the 1940 Act. Investors,an affiliated company of Western Life, is the principal underwriter forthe policies and is registered as a broker-dealer under the SecuritiesExchange Act of 1934. Account C currently consists of five subaccounts,each of which invests exclusively in shares of a corresponding portfolioof AMEV Series Funds, Inc., a registered management investment company.2. The policy permits the policy owner to select (and change from timeto time) between two death benefit options. Under one of these optionsthe ``policy value'' is added to the policy's ``face amount'' of insurancecoverage for purposes of computing the death benefit. The policy owneralso may change the face amount from time to time, subject to certain restrictions.3. The policy may be fully surrendered at any time for its ``surrendervalue,'' and, generally after the first policy year, the policy owner maymake a partial withdrawal of surrender value once a year. The policy owneralso may take out policy loans and has considerable flexibility to varythe frequency and amount of premium payments.4. The policy will not lapse for a specified number of years if certainminimum premium payments are made. For purposes of this guaranteed deathbenefit the premium payment requirement is based on monthly ``minimum premiums.''Mostly minimum premiums are also used, among other things, to make certainsales charge and ``policy value advance'' computations under a policy.Under various circumstances, different monthly minimum premiums may beused for different purposes, but in no case will the sum of twelve monthlyminimum premiums with respect to a policy (or benefit change) exceed the``guideline annual premium'' with respect to such policy (or change, respectively)as defined in Rule 6e-3(T)(c)(8).5. The ``policy value'' is the amount available to earn a return for thepolicy owner pursuant to the policy. Unless prohibited in any state byapplicable insurance law, a policy may be eligible for a credit in theform of a policy value advance on the last day of each of the 9th through19th policy years. Eligible policies may receive a policy value advanceonly if, as of the date of the credit, (1) the cumulative amount of premiumspaid over the life of the policy, less any outstanding policy loans, andless the cumulative amount of partial withdrawals taken by the policy owner,at least equals (2) the cumulative monthly minimum premiums to date. Ifthe premium requirement is not met for any credit, no further policy valueadvances will be paid. Western Life currently intends that, for eligiblepolicies, the policy value advance paid at the end of the 9th policy yearwill equal 10% of the average of the total monthly minimum premiums foreach year to date. At the end of each of the 10th through 19th policy years,Western Life intends to make similar policy value advances to policiesthat continue to be eligible, in the amount of 10% of the average minimumpremiums for each year to date. Any policy value advance will be allocatedamong the investment alternatives then in use under the policy on a ``prorata basis.'' Following such allocation, these amounts will be creditedwith investment performance and otherwise be treated the same as any otheramounts of policy value. 6. Policy value advances at the foregoing rate is not guaranteed, and WesternLife reserves the right in its sole discretion to reduce it, subject toguaranteed minimum rates. The guaranteed rates are based on the insured'sage at policy issue, as follows: ages 0-40, 10%; ages 41-43, 9%; ages 44-46,8.25%; ages 47-50, 7.5%; ages 51-55, 6%; ages 56-60, 5.5%; and 61-70, 5%.7. Western Life will give policy owners notice that they may be forfeitingpolicy value advances by failing to make sufficient premium payments. Eachyear, a statement sent to the policy owner will tell the policyowenr thedollar amount that he or she must pay for the year (plus any unpaid amountsfrom prior years) to be eligible for policy value advances. If no suchpremiums must be paid, this will be set forth on the statement.8. Currently, a premium tax charge of 2.3% of all premium payments is assessedthrough monthly and daily deductions from policy value. Any portion ofsuch monthly and daily deductions that is not recovered by Western Lifepursuant to the monthly and daily deductions may be deducted as part ofthe surrender charge. 9. A sales charge in the amount of 7\1/2\% of all premium payments is alsoassessed through the monthly and daily deductions from policy value. Anyamount of this sales charge that is not recovered by Western Life throughthese monthly and daily deductions may be deducted as part of the surrendercharge. 10. The monthly deduction for premium tax and sales totals $4.00 per monthand the daily deduction for these purposes is at an aggregate annual rateof .27% of the value of the policy's net assets in Account C. These monthlyand daily deductions, however, will be waived to the extent that the cumulativeamount of all such deductions would exceed 9.8% of all premium paymentsmade to date. Nor will these premium tax and sales charge deductions bemade at any time when the similar deductions for a policy value advanceare being made. 11. As part of the surrender charge, Western Life imposes an additionalcontingent deferred sales charge in the amount of 12% of premiums paidin the first two policy years that are not in excess of the sum of twelvemonthly minimum premiums. 12. An additional amount of contingent deferred sales charge will be payableon certain total surrenders or policy lapses following an increase in faceamount requested by the policy owner. The maximum additional contingentdeferred sales charge will be 12% of the lesser of (1) the sum of twelvemonthly minimum premiums for the face amount increase or (2) the amountof actual premium payments deemed attributable to the increase which aremade not later than two years after the date of the increase. Any suchadditional contingent deferred sales charge arising from a face amountincrease is payable only as part of the surrender charge. 13. A charge for other policy issuance expenses is also imposed under apolicy. This charge is $5.00 per thousand dollars of a policy's initialface amount and also will be imposed following any increase in face amount.This charge is deducted only as part of the surrender charge. This chargewill not exceed the amount permitted by Rule 6e-(T)(b)(13)(iii)(A). 14. The maximum surrender charge is the sum of the following components:(1) Any portion of the current 2.3% premium tax charge and the 7\1/2\%sales charge referred to above that has not yet been collected throughthe monthly and daily deductions; (2) the additional contingent deferredsales charge; and (3) the charge for other policy (or increase) issuanceexpenses. The entire surrender charge for the initial face amount and eachface amount increase is subject to an overall upper limit or ``cap,'' basedon the insured's age and the face amount (or face amount increase). Thiscap decreases on the fifth and each subsequent policy anniversary (or faceamount increase anniversary, as the case may be) until it reaches zeroon the eleventh policy anniversary (or increase anniversary). 15. The amount of any policy value advance paid by Western Life is subjectto recovery through the following deductions made after the payment ofthe advance: $4.00 per month (as part of the monthly deduction) plus adaily deduction at an annual rate of .27% of the value of the policy'snet assets in Account C. These deductions continue until their cumulativeamount equals the cumulative amount of policy value actually credited tothe policy. These deductions will not be made under any policy that hasnot received a policy value advance. 16. The monthly deduction from policy value includes (1) premium tax andsales charges of recovery of policy value advances, (2) the cost of insurancecharge, (3) a monthly charge for the guaranteed death benefit (in the amountof $.01 per thousand dollars of face amount under the policy of any optionalriders), (4) the charge for optional insurance benefits added by rider,and (5) the monthly administrative expense charge of $4.50 per policy.This charge will not exceed the amount permitted by Rule 6e-(T)(b)(13)(iii)(A).17. A daily charge is made for mortality and expenses risks assumed byWestern Life. The charge is at an annual rate of .90% of the average dailyvalue of the net assets in Account C that are attributable to the policies.18. Applicants request exemptions from sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(1)to the extent necessary to permit the deduction of monthly and daily chargesto recover value advances. Applicants submit that because the recoveryof all or part of a policy value advance merely returns to Western Lifeits own assets, such recovery is not a payment of the sort addressed bysection 26(a)(2)(C). In this respect, deductions to recover policy valueadvances are similar to the removal from separate account assets amountsnecessary to secure policy loans, or to secure additional policy loansthat are made automatically in order to ``capitalize'' loan interest thatthe policy owner has not otherwise paid. Similarly, deductions by WesternLife to recover policy value advances may reasonably be viewed as capitaladjustments rather than a charge or expense of the type addressed by section26(a)(2)(C). 19. Section 27(c)(2) requires only that the ``proceeds'' of ``payments''(<T3>i.e.</T3>, amounts paid by the investor) be deposited with a trusteeand held subject to the requirements of Section 26. The statutory languageitself thus lends support to the conclusion that recovery by Western Lifeof policy value advances is outside the ambit of those provisions, insofaras the policy value advance does not constitute ``proceeds'' of ``payments''made by an investor, but is rather an advance made by Western Life fromits own funds. 20. Policy value advances will provide a significant potential benefitto policy owners that are eligible for them. They increase the amount availableto earn a return for the policy owner. In many cases, moreover, the amountof a policy value advance will never be recovered, or will be only partiallyrecovered, by Western Life. This is because no contingent deferred chargefor unrecovered policy value advances is imposed upon death of the insured,surrender, withdrawal or lapse. The total amount deducted to recover policyvalue advances under any policy will never exceed the amount of policyvalue advances actually paid to that policy. 21. The policy owner receives the further benefit that, during the timewhen deductions for policy value advances are being made, the similar monthlyand daily deductions for premium taxes and sales charges are suspended.The amounts of premimum tax and sales charges that are thus deferred areequal to the amounts of the monthly and daily deductions for policy valueadvances, assuming the 9.8% maximum on the monthly and daily premium taxand sales charge deductions would not have otherwise been reached. Once the amount of any policy value advances has been fully recovered throughthe deductions therefor, the monthly and daily deductions for premium taxesand sales charges resume, unless the total monthly and daily deductionsactually made to date for premium taxes and sales charges already has reached9.8% of all premiums paid to date. The policy owner is not deemed to have``paid'' any periodic premium tax and sales charges that otherwise wouldhave been deducted during the period when deductions to recover policyvalue advances were being made. Nevertheless, the deferral of these chargesis a significant benefit that enhances the value to policy owners of thepolicy value advance feature. The deferral of these charges tends to offsetthe deductions made to recover policy value advances and therefore hasa positive effect on policy value. This benefit is illustrated by the illustrationsfiled as an appendix to the application.22. A policy value advance will increase the policy value and, accordingly,may increase the amount of certain charges that are deducted by WesternLife on the basis of a percentage of Account C or AMEV Series assets: <T3>i.e., </T3>the mortaility and expense risk charge and the AMEV Seriesinvestment advisory fee. The increased asset-based charges in each caseare simply the price the policy owner pays for the opportunity of havingamounts attributable to the transaction participate in the investment performanceof Account C. The policy owner can avoid the increased asset-based chargesin each case by allocating the policy value to the general account, ratherthan to Account C.23. There is no assurance that separate account investment performanceearned on policy value advances will be sufficient to offset the additionalasset-based charges resulting from the policy value advances. This woulddepend to some extent on the timing of the policy value advances and ofthe deductions to recover them, because these factors indirectly determinethe amount of return that would be credited. A policy owner who wants tobe assured of earning a rate of return greater than the rate of asset-basedcharges can allocate amounts attributable to policy value advances to WesternLife's general account.24. The policy value advances involve various costs to Western Life, includingthe cost of the amounts advanced and the costs of developing and administeringthe policy value advance feature. Even if the development and administrationcosts are disregarded, there is no reasonable set of assumptions underwhich (1) the value to Western Life of (a) the revenues from the deductionsfor policy value advances plus (b) any increased mortality and expenserisk charge and advisory fee revenues resulting from policy value advanceswould exceed (2) Western Life's additional costs associated with policyvalue advances. Therefore, the policy value advances and related chargescould not be said to involve any ``back door'' attempt to impose additionalcharge on policy owners.25. The deductions for policy value advances do not contain hidden chargesbecause the deductions to recover policy value advances, as well as thepossibility of increased asset-based charges, will be fully disclosed inthe prospectus for the policies. Nor do these deductions result in profitsto Western Life, since they merely defray the cost of credits previouslypaid to policies by Western Life out of its own funds. The deductions torecover policy value advances are not intended to finance sales expenses.Their sole purpose and effect is to reimburse Western Life for amountsthat Western Life will have advanced to the policy owner.26. Policy value advances are intended as benefits that will make policiesmore attractive to prospective purchasers and will encourage policy ownersto retain and make regular premium payments under their policies. Lifeinsurance policies are typically quite unprofitable to an insurance companyin the policies' early years because each policy typically has high initialinsurance costs (such as sales expenses and underwriting costs) and asset-basedrevenues are likely to be relatively small. To the extent that the objectivesof the policy value advance are achieved, it will be less likely that WesternLife at some point would need to raise its charges for cost of insurance,administrative expenses or certain policy features to achieve their objectives,and the possibility will be increased that Western Life may be able tooffer additional investment options or reduce charges under policies inthe future. Policy owners may also benefit from lower expense ratios ofthe management investment company funding the policies, as a result ofincreased assets attributable to policies. Insufficient sales or poor persistencyalso can produce a small and non-diverse pool of mortality risks representedby the policies. This would expose Western Life to the possibility of erraticmortality experience. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that policiestend not to be surrendered when the insured is in poor health. A high rateof surrenders, therefore, would tend to decrease the overall quality ofthe mortality pool represented by the policies. Thus, if the policy valueadvances achieve their objectives, Western Life's financial strength andstability will be enhanced, as will as the security of the policy owner'sinvestment in and coverage under the policies.27. Policy value advances also will promote fairness between persistingand surrendering policy owners. Because persisting policy owners make substantialpremium payments, they are expected to generate more profits for WesternLife. It is therefore equitable for persisting policy owners to receiveadditional benefits in the form of policy value advances.28. Western Life has designed the policy value advances and its methodof operation so as to address any state regulatory concerns. Western Lifehas specifically designed the policy value advances to avoid any substantialdiscontinuities in projected values. All sales illustrations used by WesternLife will specifically disclose the amount of any policy value advancesthat are assumed by the illustration. The policy value advances are notcontingent on Western Life's actually earning profits and Western Lifewill establish current reserves for planned policy value advances.29. The Commission has in the past acquiesced in or approved of an insurancecompany making deductions to recover or defray the cost of providing benefitsto investors similar to those afforded by policy value advances. For example,deductions to recover policy value advances are similar to the removalfrom separate account assets of amounts necessary to secure policy loans,or to secure additional policy loans that are made automatically in orderto ``capitalize'' loan interest that the policy owner has not otherwisepaid. Also, the Commission has granted exemptive relief from sections 27(c)(2)and 26(a)(2)(C) with respect to contingent deferred charges to recover``bonuses'' credited by an insurance company under certain variable annuitycontracts.\1\<NOTE/> There would appear no reason for reaching a different resultin this case.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ <T3>In the Matter of the Prudential Ins. Co. of America, et al.,</T3> Rel.No. IC-16769 (Jan. 25, 1989) (Notice); Rel. No. IC-16824 (Feb. 21, 1989)(Order); <T3>In the Matter of the Prudential Ins. Co. of America, et al.,</T3> Rel.No. IC-15240 (Aug. 8, 1986) (Notice); Rel. No. IC-15299 (Sept. 8, 1986)(Order).30. Applicants request exemptions from sections 2(a)(32), 22(c), 27(c)(1)and 27(d) and Rules 6e-3(T)(b)(12), and 6e-3(T)(b)(13) and 22c-1, to theextent necessary to permit the amount of any premium tax charges that havenot been previously collected by means of a deduction from policy valueto be included in the surrender charge.31. Western Life's method of deducting all or part of the charges for premiumtaxes on a basis other than from premiums is more favorable to investorsthan deducting the entire amount of such charges from premium payments,to the extent that more policy value is available to earn a return forthe investor. Applicants represent that (1) no premium tax charge willbe designed to yield a profit, (2) the total amount charged to any policyowner for permium taxes (including any amounts that Western Life may subsequentlydetermine to deduct from premium payments) will be no greater than if allsuch charges were taken from premiums when paid, and (3) the premium taxcharges will not take into account the ``time value'' of money (which wouldincrease the charge to factor in the investment cost to Western Life ofdeferring collection of the charge).32. Applicants request an exemption from the ``stair step'' requirementsof section 27(a)(3) and Rules 6e-3(T)(b)(13)(ii) and (d)(1)(ii) to theextent necessary because of three aspects of the policies discussed below.33. First, part of the $4.00 monthly charge deducted pursuant to each policyis a sales charge. Because this sales charge is a constant dollar amounteach month, it will vary from month to month as a percentage of premiumspaid and as a percentage of the policy onwer's policy value. Assessingpart of the sales charge as a flat monthly deduction is beneficial to policyowners, as compared to deducting it from premium payments. A greater amountis thus available to earn an investment return for the policy owner. Also,the dollar amount of the sales charge deductions will be more predictablethan if the sales charge were deducted through a daily percentage charge.This has potential advantages for both the policy owner and for WesternLife, insofar as their ability to make plans based on expected amountsof sales charge deductions is thereby enhanced. The flat dollar amountdeducted monthly for sales charges under a policy will not change frommonth to month, except in the case of a reduction as a result of transferfrom another plan of insurance. At least one other registrant appears tooffer several variable life insurance policies that deduct constant amountsof sales charges from a policy's account value in reliance on Rule 6e-3(T),without, to Applicant's knowledge, obtaining exemptive relief from thestair step provisions. Although it may therefore be regarded as unnecessary,Applicants are requesting such relief to eliminate any uncertainty in thisregard.34. Second, the monthly and daily sales charge deductions may cease forcertain periods of time and subsequently resume. These charges are suspendedwhen deductions to recover policy value advances are being made and whenthe maximum amount of such charges, as a percentage of premium payments,has been reached. This creates a question regarding compliance with therequirements in Rule 6e-3(T)(d)(1)(ii)(A) and (B), respectively, that theproportionate or percentage amount of sales charges deducted not exceedthe proportionate or percentage amount previously deducted pursuant tothe same method.35. Applicants assert that, if section 27(a)(3) and the related provisionsof Rule 6e-3(T) were interpreted to prevent the resumption of sales chargedeductions from contract assets once the deduction of such charges hadceased for any reason, the utility of policy designs providing for salescharge deductions from policy assets would be greatly reduced. Deductingpart of the sales charges from policy value, rather than from premium payments,is advantageous to policy owners because more assets are put to work aspolicy value with the potential of earning a return for the policy owner'sbenefit.36. Certain other variable life insurance issuers impose asset-based salescharges that may cease upon certain limits being reached and subsequentlyrecommence when additional premiums are paid. The same is true with respectto several variable life insurance policies that deduct the sales loadattributable to a premium payment from the policy's account value in periodicinstallments of a fixed amount. To Applicant's knowledge, in none of thesecases have stair step exemptions been granted to permit sales charge deductionsto be resumed upon payment of additional premiums subsequent to the timesuch deductions reached the maximum permitted percentage of premiums previouslypaid. Applicants submit, therefore, that such relief has been regardedas unnecessary. Nevertheless, Applicants are requesting such relief herein order to eliminate any uncertainty in this regard.37. Third, Rule 6e-3(T)(c)(4) defines ``sales load'' for any contract periodas the excess of premium payments over changes in ``cash value'' (otherthan from investment performance) and certain enumerated charges. An increaseor decrease in a policy's cash value resulting from the payment of or subsequentdeductions to recover a policy value advance could be deemed to resultin an increase or decrease in the otherwise applicable sales load for thecontract period in which the transaction occurs. The stair step provisionscould apply because the operation of the policy value advance could causesuch sales load to be at a higher rate than in a preceding period or ata lower rate than in a subsequent period. Applicants submit that theirprogram with respect to policy value advances provides a significant potentialbenefit to policy owners and the policies' charge structure complies withthe spirit and purpose of Rules 6e-3(T)(b)(13)(ii) and (d)(1)(ii).38. The potential stair step issues under the policies do not result fromearly deduction of front-end charges. No sales charges will be deductedfrom premiums. Although sales charges will be deducted through severaldifferent types of deductions, the rates of these charges will never increase.39. The stair step issues under the policies result from the deferral byWestern Life of sales charges in the form of monthly and daily deductionsand, in the case of policies that are surrendered or lapse before a certaintime, the surrender charge. In two recent no-action letters, the Commissionstaff examined in detail the policies and purposes underlying section 27(a)(3).\2\<NOTE/> The staff concluded, based on extenstive citation of authority,that the provision was designed to address the perceived abuse of periodicpayment plan certificates that deducted large amounts of front-end salescharges so early in the life of the plan that an investor redeeming inthe early periods would recoup little or none of his or her investment.Western Life's policies present an entirely different case. The potentialstair step issues under the policies do not result from early deductionof front-end charges. No sales charges will be deducted from premiums.The stair step uncertainties under the policies in fact result from theimposition of deferred sales charges in the form of monthly and daily deductionsand, in the case of policies that are surrendered or lapse before a certaintime, the surrender charge. By thus spreading sales charges more evenlyand fairly over the life of a policy, the policies' sales charge structureclearly furthers the purposes of section 27(a)(3), as articulated by theCommission's staff. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ United Investors Life Ins.
