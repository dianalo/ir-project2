 These technologiesinclude repositories that store information from multiple programs and frommultiple vendors.andP;  Also, the relentless extension of local area networkarchitectures and distributed functions in a manner increasingly transparentto end users portends a &quot;global village.&quot;andM;Database server technology will also be a factor.andP;  The functional dedicationof the information resource to powerful processing platforms will furtheradvance the move to universal data sharing.andM;Today, no vendor can afford to ignore existing and emerging softwarestandards.andP;  &quot;It is pretty difficult to think of a more important topic forthe '90s than that of standards,&quot; declared Dr. George Schussel, president ofDigital Consulting Inc. in Andover, Mass.andP;  &quot;It is what people in thisindustry want.andP;  They are increasingly demanding products that are based onindustry standards.andP;  It is a movement that will not be denied,&quot; he said.andM;Ralph Barker, director of technical services for Uniform, Santa Clara,Calif., an association of Unix developers and users, offered similarsentiments.andP;  &quot;The impact of standards are beneficial to the user.andP;  They canobtain pieces of a system from various vendors when there are standardizedinterfaces.andP;  Our organization, under its former name,/usr/group, provided theinitial impetus for Posix (Portable Operating System Interface for Unix).andP;  Weare not a standards developing organization, so the ultimate thrust comesfrom IEEE; but our association recognized the need for standards early on,&quot;he affirmed.andM;Today, the three premiere standards environments are Unix, IBM's SystemsApplication Architecture (SAA) and Digital Equipment Corporation's NetworkApplication Support (NAS).andP;  Each is quite different in intent and scope; allthree arose from diverse circumstances to meet a perceived need in thetechnological marketplace.andM;A software supplier might argue that it is in the best position to offerintegration services, given that its sales are not tied to the sale of asingle hardware platform.andP;  That is part of the rationale behind CA90s, therecently unveiled blueprint architecture of Computer Associates International(CA), Garden City, N.Y.andM;&quot;The hardware vendors have proposed software architectures that are valid anduseful,&quot; said Bryan Shepherd, senior vice president of marketing for CA.andO;&quot;Where we differ is that we see the Common User Access as valuable in non-SAAand non-IBM environments.andP;  We can add value to SAA, NAS and otherarchitectures.&quot;andM;In terms of seniority, Unix came first.andP;  Initially an esoteric piece ofsoftware, Unix has traversed multiple paths to reach its present state.andP;  (SeeFigure 1.)andM;Developed by ATandamp;T's Bell Labs in the late 1960s, Unix featured unencumberedmultiuser, multitasking capabilities resident in a modularly designedoperating system.andP;  It was unencumbered in terms of end-user utility andfunctionality, a situation still being rectified.andM;An important distinction between Unix and its early competitors is that Unixwas written in the C programming language as opposed to machine language.andP;  Itis more portable than operating systems developed in lower-level languages.andO;Unix can, and does, function on numerous hardware platforms, since the codedoes not have to be entirely rewritten each time the environment changes.andM;Commercial acceptance for Unix has grown slowly.andP;  Originally, it was mostlyconfined to academia; ATandamp;T offered Unix free to colleges and universities.andO;Ultimately, this strategy paid off.andP;  The University of California at Berkeleyadded networking features (the TCP/IP public domain protocol set created forthe Department of Defense), improved software development tools and providedextensive support for peripherals.andM;Berkeley continues its work on the operating system today.andP;  Its BSD 4.3(Berkeley Software Distribution) is being incorporated into ATandamp;T's currentSystem V, release 4.andP;  BSD 4.4 will add OSI communication standards.andM;The BSD version of Unix served as the model for system control software foundin many popular engineering workstations.andP;  Companies such as SunMicrosystems, Hewlett-Packard and Masscomp adopted aspects of the BSDpackage.andM;Unix has thus evolved from special-purpose operating system appropriate for&quot;thin air&quot; academic settings, offering virtually no end-user amenities, tomultifaceted operating environment.andM;ENTER IBM's &quot;UNIFIER&quot;andM;SAA is to Unix as economic planning is to hard currency.andP;  It is IBM's&quot;unifier,&quot; perhaps the company's most important architectural offering sinceSystems Network Architecture (SNA) was announced in 1974.andP;  SNA is IBM's datacommunications architecture, which defines an integrated (to a degree)architecture based on published canons that describe the programming,communications and user interface.andP;  It provides a standard operatingenvironment for IBM processing systems, with capabilities to gateway to otherproducts.andM;&quot;SAA, along with Unix, are broad-based standards, the two most importantright now,&quot; said DCI's Schussel.andP;  &quot;They are more than standards limited to aspecific area.andP;  SAA and Unix map out an entire architecture.andM;&quot;In terms of software, IBM is now SAA, plus SNA and AIX.andP;  SAA brings togethermost of their software and hardware products.andP;  It defines IBM's directionsfor years to come.andP;  Unix remains the major alternative to SAA, not betterthan SAA but a viable alternative,&quot; he added.andP;  (AIX, for Advanced InteractiveExecutive, is IBM's name for its implementation of the Unix operatingsystem.)andM;There are a few dissidents who protest SAA's description as an architecture.andO;They believe it is more a conglomeration of disparate parts that have beenbrought together from existing software inventories and given the&quot;architecture&quot; title, notwithstanding recent IBM announcements such as OfficeVision, the planned office products family based on server-requesterarchitectureandM;Office Vision products, aimed at retiring IBM's older office products, suchas Disoss and Display-Write, will be based on OS/2, VM, MVS and OS/400servers, and OS/2 EE or PC-DOS requesters.andM;Most observers say that SAA represents a total operating environment,centered around IBM and industry-wide standards that aid in creatingconsistency, portability and interoperability across applications andsystems.andP;  It facilitates the transition from host-based processing todistributed functionality on the network.andM;Cooperative processing, heavily trumpeted by IBM, enables the implementationof database servers alluded to earlier in conjunction with powerfulworkstations available to end users.andP;  Applications will run where it is mostlogical to do so and where there are proper resources to support theirexecution.andM;As with Unix, SAA can be expected to go through a long evolutionary process.andO;SAA, too, will be one of the prime architectural standards encounteredthrough the '90s and beyond.andP;  Its operating system platforms will not onlyinclude conventional IBM offerings such as MVS and OS/2, but ultimately mayinclude AIX as well.andM;NAS from Digital Equipment Corp. has not as yet received the visibilityaccorded Unix and SAA, partly because DEC had already achieved some of thegoals of the competitors.andM;Like SAA, NAS is partly a correction of past insufficiencies, but at adifferent level.andP;  Whereas SAA seeks program compatibility across platformssuch as PS/2, AS/400 and S/370, DEC's VMS software has, to a degree, alreadyattained that goal.andP;  The company currently offers peer networking across ahomogeneous, if clonish, product line.andP;  Uniformity, not diversity, has beenDEC's byword.andM;Jackie Kahle, group manager of marketing for NAS at DEC, Maynard, Mass.,andO;described SAA as a one-vendor approach.andP;  &quot;NAS encompasses DEC componentsalong with other vendor products.andP;  It is open and unified.andP;  Unix is part ofNAS, unlike IBM's multiple SAA and AIX worlds.andP;  We plan to address additionalUnix versions within the NAS umbrella in the future,&quot; she said.andM;NAS supports &quot;multiple platforms and multivendor environments,&quot; according toKahle.andP;  &quot;We look at standards as absolutely critical.andP;  By standards, we meanvendor independent, de jare conventions.andP;  If not sanctioned by an officialstandards body, they should at least have support from multivendor consortia.andO;Although DEC addresses single-vendor environments as appropriate, NAS willemphasize multivendor configurations,&quot; she said.andM;NAS is a plan for compatibility at the base application level.andP;  This willpermit VMS, Ultrix, MS-DOS, OS/2 and Apple environments to exchangedocuments, share data and distribute mail among any of the aforementionedsystem entities.andP;  Gateways to other systems will also be possible.andM;AIA, CORNERSTONE OF NASandM;The foundation for NAS is based in DEC's Application Integration Architecture(AIA).andP;  The latter defines architectural specifications and ApplicationProgramming Interfaces (APIs) based on industry standards.andP;  APIs serve as theconduit between applications and standards.andP;  Netbios is an example of an API.andO;Any application invoking Netbios commands in the proper environment willactivate an OSI Session-like activity to accomplish a function.andP;  Thus, NASaccess to APIs, libraries, utilities and toolkits support applicationinteraction among systems.andP;  (See Figure 2.)andP;  A majority of APIs associatedwith NAS are derived from the Open Software Foundation.andM;&quot;NAS is a blueprint for application integration in a distributed multivendorenvironment,&quot; declared DEC's NAS program manager Vik Muizenieks.andP;  &quot;There arelots of pieces, but they are not all there yet.&quot;andP;  He added that NAS willprovide insulation from native operating systems for most applicationsthrough standards-based APIs.andM;None of these market Goliaths are truly all there yet.andP;  Unix certainly hasthe advantage in development time, but it, too, continues to evolve.andP;  SAA andNAS are relative infants, but are clear enough in concept and offer enoughproducts to discern future directions.andM;There are currently two basic approaches to Unix software.andP;  System V, release4, promulgated by the Parsippany, N.J.-based Unix International (UI) andOSF/1 from the Cambridge, Mass.-based Open Software Foundation (OSF).andP;  Thereare other variants, of course, but System V and the OSF entry represent majorforces at the moment.andP;  Even IBM's power move to Unix workstations centers onthe use of AIX version 3, which employs System V principles.andM;NOT SEEING EYE-TO-EYEandM;The two industry groups advocating Unix (along with other software) have beenunable to resolve their differences.andP;  Recently, the groups formally endednegotiations to merge operations.andP;  This is the second time talks havecollapsed since the formation of the two groups in 1988.andP;  [Software Magazine,May 1990, p. 32.]andM;OSF which includes IBM, DEC, Siemens, Hewlett-Packard and Bull, had beenformulating its approach based on IBM's AIX.andP;  Late last year they added Mach,a derivative of Berkeley Unix, which features a kernel developed at CarnegieMellon University, Pittsburgh.andM;Unix International, meanwhile, uses System V, release 4, as its base.andP;  Thisversion is a consolidation of attributes found in BSD 4.3, Xenix, as well asSystem V itself.andP;  UI members include ATandamp;T, Control Data, NCR, Unisys andothers.andM;Uniforum's Barker believes the presence of differing Unix versions betweenOSF and UI is &quot;not all that bad.andP;  They represent a big percentage of themarket.andP;  In the past, Unix environments were often more complex thanconventional MIS installations.andP;  OSF and UI have helped to disseminate Unixto a wider audience, as well as consolidating some of the various versionsthat existed.andP;  Users are the winners from the value-added features that OSFand UI have appended to the software.&quot;andM;Unix is a little like philosophy.andP;  A thousand philosophers asked where the&quot;truth&quot; lies will respond with a thousand different answers.andP;  Similarly,there are diverse opinions as to the state of Unix.andP;  Some observers proclaimits improving functionality.andP;  Others express disappointment at its continuingimmaturity relative to support tools and utilities.andM;One observer who believes in the continuing strength of Unix is DCI'sSchussel.andP;  He recounts market analysts who predict Unix and SAA will reachparity by the middle of this decade.andP;  &quot;They will be equal in total dollars,each environment capturing about 25 percent of all computing expenditures.andO;The remainder will be split among DEC and other industry participants.andP;  Thus,Unix and SAA will control approximately half the money spent on computingwithin a few years,&quot; said Schussel.andM;One fact is certain, however.andP;  The many implementations of Unix on varyingcomputer systems, from workstations to large multiuser configurations, give it a broad market.andP;  It is available on more types of hardware platforms thanany other operating system.andM;One of the major elements propelling Unix is strong U.S.andP;  government support.andO;It has become a mandatory feature of federal system acquisitions, exceptwhere inappropriate for end-user purposes.andP;  An example of the latter would beextremely sensitive security requirements or special-purpose militarysystems.andM;A unifying element in the Unix versus other operating systems situation isPosix.andP;  With OS/2 and other packages professing increasing adherence to thePosix standard, a certain degree of compatibility is achieved among diversesoftware configurations.andP;  Although each operating system version may differsignificantly in design criteria, Posix interface conventions can facilitateend-user employment of these software modules.andM;&quot;Posix is a big help in the Unix market,&quot; stated Schussel.andP;  &quot;It aids the userin achieving vendor independence since it defines a whole set of interfaceconventions.andP;  The federal government is standardizing on Unix and Posix aswell.andP;  OSF and UI products will also have to meet Posix, a fact which willproduce a minimum set of uniform functions for the two user groups.&quot;andM;&quot;Vendors will eventually have to be Posix-compliant,&quot; asserted Uniforum'sBarker.andP;  &quot;This will be a benefit to small users as well as to the federalgovernment.andP;  The average end user will now enjoy the same advantages as thelarge user in regard to Posix.&quot;andM;From Digital's point of view, Posix is a reality right now.andP;  &quot;It is supportedby Ultrix [DEC's version of Unix], which is a part of NAS.andP;  There are amultitude of Unix versions.andP;  Posix will help users attain greater portabilityby presenting a uniform interface.andP;  DEC's future planning also includes aPosix interface for VMS,&quot; said group manager Kahle.andM;SAA, initially considered too good to be true, now has enough substance to beconsidered a credible design scheme.andM;Since its introduction in 1987, SAA implementations have grown consistently.andO;(See Figure 3 for a sampling.)andP;  OfficeVision and related functional systemswill continue to emerge for many years.andM;Like SNA, SAA is an architectural plan geared for the long haul.andP;  Upwards of20 years from now, IBM will still be rolling out new variations on the maintheme.andP;  By that time, system homogeneity and consolidation should be sopronounced as to simplify the adaptation process for the end user.andM;SAA &quot;DRUMBEAT CONTINUES&quot;andM;IBM's Earl Wheeler, vice president and general manager of the ProgrammingSystems Division, maintains that SAA was further along in its developmentthan SNA when it was announced.andP;  &quot;I would argue that you already have seenproducts that have significantly enabled what we introduced in March 1987 andthe drumbeat continues,&quot; he told Software Magazine in late 1989.andP;  [December1989, p. 26.]  &quot;When we introduced SNA, we were still working on higher-levelfunctions in the world of SNA.&quot;andM;The challenge of SAA is to assimilate quite unique IBM architectures into aunifiable entity that promotes portability and interoperability among theirdistinct components.andP;  DEC deals essentially with one architecture: VAX.andP;  Ifthe VAX environment is an appropriate solution for a user's needs, then itbecomes a viable candidate for acquisition.andM;IBM, on the other hand, produces at least three environments (S/370, AS/400,PS/2).andP;  They are all capable of addressing different processing problems, andeach alone is to some degree equivalent to the one VAX product line.andP;  Thus,the challenge of SAA is to accommodate not just one VAX-like series ofconfigurations, but to facilitate a user's transition among totally differentarchitectures.andP;  This challenge is infinitely more complex than dealing with asingle product line.andM;Does the VAX single-entity situation make DEC's task any easier in bringingNAS to market?andP;  Not at all, since they are addressing a related, butdifferent, problem.andP;  DEC proclaims in a corporate statement that the problemsof the '90s &quot;need a software environment that allows...applications to shareinformation and resources with each other, regardless of which systems theapplications run on.andP;  Digital is answering this need with Network ApplicationSupport [NAS].&quot;andM;As with SAA, progress has been made, but further development work will beneeded over a long period.andP;  In fact, each offering will evolve as long as itexists to assimilate continuously emerging standards in a manner appropriateto its design goals.andM;Some of the services currently available with NAS are DECWindows, VirtualTerminal Emulation, Graphic Kernel System, Electronic Data Interchangeservices, SQL services, Repository capability (CDD/Plus), Network File Systemand virtual print services.andP;  They all exist within three categories of NASfunctionality: Applications Access Services define the way users andapplications access other applications; Communications Services allow usersand applications to communicate within and external to the organization; andInformation and Resource Sharing Services allow users and applications toshare networkwide data and resources.andM;FOCUSING ON ROOTSandM;When reviewing Unix, SAA and NAS, it is important to focus on their roots.andO;Unix, initially a neat little operating system for researchers and academics,now possesses broader capabilities that merit it being called an operatingenvironment.andP;  Government support alone ensures that it will prosper andexpand for the indefinite future.andM;SAA and NAS represent architectural schemes which, from a hierarchicalviewpoint, reside above an operating system.andP;  They both are in part aresponse to a perceived deficiency in the product line.andM;SAA attempts to harmonize the multiple architectures present in IBM'sarsenal.andP;  DEC has one architecture, so its NAS is as much a response to SAAand the general competition as it is a new direction for the future.andP;  Both ofthese, along with the evolving Unix standard, and software supplier responsessuch as CA90s, promise to keep major software architectures maturing for manyyears to come.andM;Cashin is a writer, lecturer and advisor on software and communicationsissues.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
