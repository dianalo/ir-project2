The program, called ``Our Nature,'' calls for a temporary end togovernment tax and financing benefits for large-scale cattleranching in the northern Amazon and a ban on exports of unprocessedtropical timber.   Environmentalists have charged that the clearing of vast Amazontracts by the primitive slash-and-burn method has released hundredsof tons of noxious gases into the atmosphere.   They say this causes the greenhouse effect, the gradual warmingof the Earth's atmosphere by a concentration of pollutants that actlike a blanket, trapping the sun's warmth.   Brazil's government-run Space Research Institute said about77,000 square miles of land were cleared by the slash-and-burnmethod in 1987 and forecast a similar amount for this year.   ``We must create nationwide consciousness that we are allpassengers in the adventure of Man on Earth,'' Sarney said in aceremony announcing the program. ``The era of unlimited naturalresources is over.''   The ``Our Nature'' program also contains a recommendation toBrazil's Congress to cut mercury imports. Free-lance goldprospectors throughout the Amazon use the highly toxic element toseparate gold from river silt and then throw the waste into thewater.   ``This program is going to shake up powerful economicinterests,'' said Antonio Jose Guimaraes, president of Brazil'sfederal Forest Service. ``But the government is resolved to carryit out.''   Earlier laws designed to colonize and develop the poor AmazonBasin, which covers an area equal to roughly two-thirds of the 48continental United States, permitted land developers to burn off 50percent of their properties _ the fastest and cheapest way to openup clear areas _ and then gave them tax deductions for doing so.   The World Bank has estimated that since 1978 this type ofland-clearing in the Brazilan Amazon has destroyed 240,000 squaremiles of natural tropical rainforest cover _ an area larger thanCalifornia.   Interior Minister Joao Alves said the tax break suspensions weretemporary, because the government is working out a plan todetermine which parts of the Amazon can be used for farming andranching and which must be left alone.   Even before ``Our Nature'' was announced, private Amazondevelopers complained about the plan.   Orlando Mariutti, who has three projects on a total of 136,000acres in the western state of Mato Grosso, told the newspaper Folhade S. Paulo that ``Cutting tax incentives will hold backdevelopment of the Amazon.''   Large developers in the region, he said, ``generally preservemore than the 50 percent of the land required by law.''</TEXT></DOC>
