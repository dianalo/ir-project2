According to preliminary results from the national electoralboard, 50.1 percent of those participating voted for the firstquestion on the ballot: ``Should the presidential elections be heldonly after the parliamentary elections?''   It was Hungary's first free election in more than four decades,and the first since the Communists dissolved their party, renamedit the Socialist Party and opened the way for free, multipartypolitics.   A statement from the board said the four opposition groupssponsoring the referendum won by only 6,618 votes. Official finalresults were to be announced Tuesday.   Of the 4,297,454 valid votes cast in the first referendum inpostwar Hungary, 2,152,036 favored the question and 2,145,418 wereopposed.   Hours earlier, Imre Pozsgay, the Socialist Party presidentialcandidate, acknowledged the opposition had won.   The other three questions on the ballot were approvedoverwhelmingly, said the electoral board statement carried by theofficial news agency MTI.   It said 95.1 percent of voters wanted the party out of theworkplace, 95.4 percent said the ruling party should reveal itsassets, and 94.9 percent favored disbanding the Workers' Militia, aparty army that already is melting away.   Pozsgay told a news conference earlier Monday: ``While inEastern and Central Europe people by the hundreds of thousands aremarching in the streets to express their opinion, Hungarians aregoing to the ballot box to express their political will.''   Victory for the opposition means new democratic Parliament, tobe chosen by June, will elect the president. If voters had defeatedthe referendum, they would have elected a president directly onJan. 7.   Opposition groups said an election in January left them toolittle time to organize a serious challenge to Pozsgay. They hopeto win strong representation in the new Parliament, which wouldgive their candidate a better chance at the presidency.   Recent opinion polls indicate the Socialist Party will not win amajority of the seats.   Pal Kara, secretary of the referendum committee in Parliament,said 58.2 percent of the 7.8 million eligible voters cast ballots.   The opposition alliance has proposed that Parliament amend theconstitution to allow a popular election of the president after thenew Parliament is elected. It also proposed curtailing thepresident's powers.   Ivan Petoe, a leader of the Free Democrats, said the presidentshould not have the power to dissolve Parliament. Under the currentconstitution, the president also is commander of the armed forcesand can call elections.   Pozsgay, asked about the opposition proposal to hold directelections after the new Parliament is elected, said he was``happy'' about it.   He said he had no wish to be ``a fully weakened presidentialfigurehead. ... That is different from my perception.'' Pozsgayadded, however, that he did not believe the head of state shouldhave ``arbitrary power.''   If Parliament chooses the president, Pozsgay said, his chancesof getting the job will diminish ``because, in that case, theposition is subject to political bargaining.''</TEXT></DOC>
