All you had to do was teach at a leading law school, writecompelling treatises, draft scholarly legal opinions and coinsuch memorable phrases as &quot;The life of the law has not beenlogic; it has been experience.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Forget Justice Holmes -- he wouldn't even make the shortlist today.   For every lawyer dreaming of a seat on the U.S. SupremeCourt, the rules have changed. The nomination of DavidSouter, possibly the lowest-profile nominee in history,should send thousands of lawyers in search of Wite-Out toremove entries from their resumes.   The new canon of how to be appointed to the Supreme Courtincludes such directives as:                                                                                                          -- DON'T write law review articles on important legalissues of the day.   -- DON'T teach at a law school, where one's ideas arechallenged -- and remembered -- by students and faculty.   -- DON'T speak on the lecture circuit.   -- DON'T serve long enough on a federal court to establisha judicial record that can be scrutinized.   -- DON'T do or say anything unconventional.   Judge Souter, who satisfied all the mandatory don'ts -- aswell as winning extra credit for not writing for the lawreview while in law school or clerking for an appellate judgeafter graduation -- is the ultimate tabula rasa.   He served on the federal appeals court in Boston for sucha short time that he wrote no opinions, and cases he handledwhile on the New Hampshire Supreme Court didn't usuallyinvolve him in constitutional controversies.   Judge Souter is widely described as a scholar, a labelthat seems surprising, says New York lawyer David Boies,because &quot;ordinarily you think of a scholar as someone engagedin research and writing and scholarship. The one thing you doknow is that he is not engaged in the activities of ascholar.&quot;   It's easy to see why such proven judicial scholars asFrank Easterbrook and Richard Posner of the federal appealscourt in Chicago, Amalya Kearse and Ralph Winter Jr. of thefederal appeals court in New York, or Patrick Higginbothamand Edith Jones of the federal appeals court in New Orleansdidn't make the cut. They didn't follow the revised &quot;rules.&quot;   Those rules are prompting confusion and alarm among thelegal elite.   Bruce Fein, the conservative legal pundit who recentlypredicted confidently that Solicitor General Kenneth Starr(an inveterate revised-rule breaker with a long record as anappellate judge and Justice Department official) would getthe nomination, can't say enough bad things about the presentsituation.   &quot;I can't think of any outstanding justices who have cometo the Supreme Court as such a non-entity as Mr. Souter,&quot;says Mr. Fein.   Mr. Fein says the new litmus test for appointees appearsto be, &quot;Have you written anything that's challenged theconventional wisdom? Have you performed as an advocate or ajudge on any important issue? Is your manner of speakingsharp and pointed, as opposed to phlegmatic?&quot; The correctanswer to all questions is &quot;no.&quot;   Court-watchers say the revised &quot;rules&quot; are, in part, theproduct of a still-massive hangover from the divisive battlein which outspoken conservative nominee Robert Bork failed towin Senate confirmation in 1987. A rules revision seemed evenmore urgent when Judge Douglas Ginsburg withdrew fromconsideration after word of his past marijuana use put hisconfirmation in jeopardy.   But legal scholars say the list of don'ts also reflectsthe cautious character of President Bush, the close splitbetween conservatives and liberals on the Court and thedominance of abortion as a political issue. In addition, witha Democratic Senate and a Republican White House, keyjudicial nominations are likely to be hard fought.   Judge Souter, a conservative in temperament and judicialphilosophy, without a trace of a record on his views on theconstitutionality of abortion, isn't likely to rufflefeathers during confirmation hearings. That's particularlyimportant as this is an election year.   &quot;The last thing you want in a Supreme Court nominee is arecord,&quot; says Alan Morrison, a prominent public-interestlawyer in Washington. &quot;The Senate can't beat you withnothing.&quot;   Of course, not all Supreme Court nominees through theyears have had the prior career achievements of JusticesFelix Frankfurter, Louis Brandeis and Holmes. And even somejustices who later became well respected, such as William J.Brennan Jr., the man Judge Souter is being nominated tosucceed, were little known at confirmation time and didn'tbegin with overwhelming credentials.   For his part, Judge Souter is a Harvard Law Schoolgraduate and former Rhodes Scholar, and he is lauded by NewHampshire lawyers for his keen legal mind and his quicknessin oral arguments. State bar president John T. Brodericksays, &quot;If you get an opportunity to spend 10 minutes talkingto him about the law, you are in the presence of someone veryspecial. And if you argue before him, you find he has acompelling mind.&quot;   Nonetheless, unlike most previous court nominees, JudgeSouter seems never to have expressed himself on any importantlegal or philosophical matter -- in any forum. While SandraDay O'Connor was a state appeals judge before her nominationand had never sat on a federal bench, she had articulated herviews on issues as an Arizona state legislator. AnthonyKennedy, the most recent appointee, wasn't a household namein legal circles before his nomination, but he had served for12 years on the federal appeals court in San Francisco andhad taught constitutional law for more than two decades.   The big question now is whether the new set of rules willremain in effect when Justices Thurgood Marshall and HarryBlackmun -- both in their 80s -- and perhaps others leave thecourt in coming years.   Lawyers say that if President Bush wins re-election, hemight be more willing to go out on a limb with a judicialcandidate who has ideas, if not skeletons, in his closet.Judge Souter &quot;certainly looks like a situational appointment-- defensive in large respect,&quot; says Harvard Law Schoolprofessor Charles Nesson. &quot;I don't know if that speaks to along-term trend. It's a situation that arises before anelection. I suspect things would be different in his secondterm.&quot;   For as long as the revised rules remain in effect,however, lawyers and judges with more obvious credentials arelikely to bemoan the current selection process.   &quot;There's no doubt in my mind that a lot of hopes weredashed this week,&quot; says Harvard Law School professor ArthurMiller, &quot;and if it's a signal that being a standout juristwith a visible record is a liability, that is a very sadsignal.&quot;   ---   Mitchell Pacelle contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
