The Camberley, Surrey-based company is DigitalCommunications' sole distributor in the UK, although the latter emphasisesthat it never appoints exclusive distributorships for its personalcomputer-to-mainframe connection products.andP;  The Irmalan gateway supports allIBM NetBIOS-compatible local area networks, and the server gateways supportPS/2s and IBM-compatibles.andP;  The three server products availa le under licenceare the Distributed Function Terminal (DFT) gateway 2, the Synchronous DataLink Control (SDLC) gateway 2, and the 802.2 gateway.andP;  The software, which isalso available as a stand-alone version, is loaded on to the server andsubsequently downloaded to the networked personal computers as required.andO;Each gateway is a complete package comprising gateway and workstationhardware and software, file transfer software, applications programinterface, and printer emulation software.andP;  Computer Marketing insists thatthe Irmalan Server hasn't just undergone a repackaging exercise, but isproviding a number of enhancements.andP;  The company cites full screen Model 5support for VGA adaptors, logic numbers displayed on the status line of theclient printer, and the addition of Irmalan Lite low memory usage emulation.andO;The entry-level system is the DFT gateway 2.andP;  As with the other products,users can copy the software as often as required, but only pay for the numberof users that require simultaneous access.andP;  The gateway is designed for smalllocal networks.andP;  It facilitates connection via coax cabling to a port on theDFT-configured 3174 cluster controller.andP;  It costs #1,200, and licenceconversion kits to increase the number of concurrent users from 16 to 64 or128 are available.andP;  Computer Marketing describes the SDLC 2 gateway as asmart card designed for larger remote networks.andP;  It supports up to 128 users,and has an on-board 80186 processor.andP;  It costs #2,800 for 16 concurrentusers, #4,400 for 64 users, and #5,499 for 128 users.andP;  The 802.2 gatewayenables workstations to run on a direct attached Token Ring in logical unitmode, and it handles SNA host access activity for the whole network.andP;  The802.2 can be used as a 3270 bridge between a direct attached Token Ring orEthernet local network, enabling 3270 sessions to be passed from one toanother without establishing a separate gateway from the network into thefront-end processor.andP;  A stand-alone workstation, using the same software asthe rest of the Irmalan family, is available for users that don't want to runthe 802.2 in logical unit mode or don't need to share applications across thelocal network.andP;  It supports up to five concurrent host sessions, and has 3278or 3279 terminal emulation.andP;  Computer Marketing has also announced thatDigital Associate's 10Net local area network is being enhanced.andP;  V4.1 willhave more than 640Kb memory, and Unix communications will be provided with aTCP/IP option.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
