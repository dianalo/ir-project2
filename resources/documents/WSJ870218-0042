Brazil's surplus totaled $129 million in January, shrinking from $701 million the year before and $156 million the month before.    If Brazil, the developing world's largest debtor, is to service its foreign debt, it needs to generate large trade surpluses. Until last October it succeeded in attaining the necessary huge export volumes. In January, however, exports declined to $1.26 billion from $1.91 billion the year before. Imports totaled $1.13 billion, contrasted with $1.21 billion.    Brazil's economic strategy is in disarray, and central bank governor Fernao Bracher resigned last week over policy conflicts with Finance Minister Dilson Funaro. And international observers are dismayed by the country's recent economic performance.    &quot;There are two surprises about Brazil,&quot; said Alan J. Stoga, a senior associate at consultants Kissinger Associates Inc. &quot;First, the extent of the damage done (to the economy) in the past months. And second, that it's taking so long for the government to come up with any new strategy.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
