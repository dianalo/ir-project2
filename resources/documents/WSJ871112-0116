Busby</HL><DD> 11/12/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><TEXT>   In &quot;The Life of the Party&quot; (Viking, 258 pages, $18.95), liberal Democrat Robert Kuttner hikes off into the demographic thickets, seeking for his party a way back to the White House and its pre-1968 majority status. His search is along generational trails.    For a man born in 1921 and one born in 1961, Mr. Kuttner explains, the life experience with government has been very different. The older man, a teen-ager during the Great Depression, may remember Father bringing home a paycheck from a New Deal works project. After himself serving in World War II, that man was helped through college by the GI bill; when he purchased a first home in which to raise his baby-boom children, a Veterans Administration loan at 4% made the financing easier. Further, in the 1950s and 1960s, he grew accustomed to seeing government &quot;provide tangible, useful things,&quot; such as new public schools and the interstate highway system.    The man born in 1961 has never known government as a &quot;provider.&quot; Since entering the work force, he has experienced it only as an &quot;omnipresent taxer,&quot; using his tax dollars to pay benefits -- such as food stamps and Medicaid -- that he neither shares nor sees.    No wonder, then, that young people seem &quot;so self-directed, so skeptical about government.&quot; That is likely to remain the case, Mr. Kuttner believes, &quot;until public policy is realigned to fit popular economic and social needs of today and tomorrow.&quot; Thus, he advises, Democrats should be striving to provide more &quot;counterparts of the GI bill, FHA loans, college grants and the whole de facto social contract that worked to serve social needs.&quot;    Exactly what those counterparts might be is unclear. Mr. Kuttner's own suggestions are politically pallid. It is hard to imagine even Adlai Stevenson igniting a union-hall audience with promises of more &quot;day care&quot; and &quot;lifetime learning.&quot;    Mr. Kuttner, the economics correspondent for The New Republic and a columnist for Business Week, disavows any intention of offering his party a &quot;campaign blueprint.&quot; Nevertheless, he does provide candid counsel.    For liberals who, after &quot;Black Monday,&quot; may be expecting 1988 to repeat 1932, he reminds of the strength of the Republican &quot;lock&quot; on the Electoral College. &quot;In the last nine elections, from 1952 on, thirty-two states have been carried by the Republican nominee at least six times,&quot; while, over the same span, only Minnesota and the District of Columbia have gone Democratic six times.    For Democratic insiders, the influence lawyers in Washington, the &quot;politically androgynous&quot; millionaires and the &quot;neo&quot; intellectuals, he has a different message. By his perception, these elements are in collusion, trying to move the Democratic Party to the center, nearer to Republican conservatism. Not unlike young Republicans before the advent of Ronald Reagan, Mr. Kuttner wants no part of such &quot;Me, tooism.&quot; &quot;It is perhaps possible to imagine two conservative parties,&quot; he concedes, but &quot;why bother?&quot;    Mr. Kuttner finds no comfort in the Democratic majorities in the House and Senate or the party's dominant position at state and local levels. That strength, he feels, is mostly &quot;inertial.&quot; Without the presidency, he argues, success for the party's goals, not to mention its survival, comes in question. Thus, out of frustration, he urges the party to disengage from foreign policy, cede the social issues and return to economic liberalism. &quot;Like every other left-of-center party in the parliamentary West,&quot; he says, &quot;the Democrats' strong suit is economics.&quot;    In summoning Democrats to be liberal again, Mr. Kuttner is somewhat behind the curve. With the GOP's siphoning off of moderates and conservatives in the 1980s, liberal Democratic constituencies are ascendant everywhere, nowhere more than in the South, long the stronghold of Democratic conservatives. Democratic House and Senate majorities in the 100th Congress are more liberal than any others in the party history. Given the present choices, the party will field in 1988 its most liberal national ticket. In the perspective of veterans of the party's wars in times past, conservatism in the Democratic Party is not sleeping; it is dead.    Mr. Kuttner senses -- rightly, in my view -- that Democratic opportunity may lie in reversing the continuing decline of voter interest and participation. The active electorate is becoming better off, better educated and smaller at each election. &quot;Democrats,&quot; he contends, &quot;need to become again the kind of party that will rally alienated voters and non-voters.&quot;    But whether his generational prescription offers much promise is doubtful. The man born in 1921, once he had his GI-bill degree and his VA home, became in 1952 the leading edge of the electorate's turn against Democratic liberalism. Men continue to be turned off by Democratic presidential candidates, while women, newly in the majority of recent electorates, are increasingly more supportive of Democratic candidates.    Gender, race, education, occupation and a host of other cultural characteristics are the building blocks for tomorrow's parties. While Mr. Kuttner gives this scant attention, the life of his party -- and the Republican Party as well -- depends upon responsiveness to these new and not necessarily economic interests.    ---   Mr. Busby, a Washington political analyst, was a longtime advisor to President Johnson. </TEXT></DOC>
