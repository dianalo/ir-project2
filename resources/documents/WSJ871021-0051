Paul Freedenberg, acting undersecretary of commerce for export administration, said Singapore is getting that status in return for strengthening enforcement of its laws forbidding traders from reshipping such products to unauthorized destinations.    Singapore's new privileges are likely to advance its goal of becoming Southeast Asia's high-technology entrepot. Jim LeMunyon, a spokesman for the American Electronics Association, said that for many small and medium-size companies, the Commerce Department action &quot;means a speedup in getting U.S. export licenses.&quot;    A few U.S. high-technology producers, including Texas Instruments Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Co., already have established manufacturing facilities in Singapore, and the latest Commerce Department action could induce other companies to follow their example.    Singapore is the first non-allied country in Asia to obtain favored treatment under U.S. export-control regulations. Previously, only Sweden, Switzerland and Finland qualified for treatment comparable to that afforded Japan and members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.    To join that exclusive circle, Singapore overhauled its system for verifying the trustworthiness of its buyers of technological items. It also trained more export inspectors, according to U.S. and Singapore officials.    Mr. Freedenberg said the new arrangement with Singapore was secured without a formal agreement. The island nation &quot;acted in its own self-interest&quot; and in a manner that is consistent with its own non-alignment, Mr. Freedenberg said.    In return, companies in Singapore will be able to import medium-level technological goods from the U.S. without any licenses, and they will qualify for fast licensing of more sophisticated products. State-owned companies won't need any licenses except when buying supercomputers, the Commerce Department said.    Most of the 1,587 licenses that the Commerce Department issued for $2.96 billion in exports to Singapore last year wouldn't have been needed if the two countries had this arrangement then, a department spokesman said.    Mr. Freedenberg said the U.S. will try next to secure similar cooperation from such other Asian countries as Hong Kong and Taiwan that are emerging as technology centers. &quot;After our success in Europe, we've found that the technology trail leads to the Pacific rim,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
