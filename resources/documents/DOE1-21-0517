Usally by the scanning procedureone and the same volume element is examined by different angle of incidenceand from different probe positions. Therefore the presentation of thewhole results by using conventional ultrasonic tomography methods needsa long time. The received image by superposition of many B-scan imageswe call echo-tomogram. The gain of this image is not only determinedby a better regulation but also by the whole presentation of the ultrasonictomography-results. The application of echo-tomography will be demonstratedon turbine- or/and generator shafts.</TEXT></DOC>
