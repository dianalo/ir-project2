ScheierandM;Computer backups have turned into a tricky legal issue for the giant ExxonCorp.andM;The firm has been in court twice in recent months because of its policies forbacking up -- and erasing -- minicomputer tapes relating to the Exxon Valdezoil spill in March.andM;It's a case involving late-night erasures, a fired computer operator whoclaims he's been made a scapegoat, suspicious state government officials andthe issue of whether a rack of backup tapes ever made it to Room 1385 inExxon's Houston headquarters.andM;One piece of evidence involves memos sent via E-mail -- the same kind ofmemos experts say shouldn't be backed up (see story above).andM;The story begins on the evenings of June 5, 6 and 7, when computer operatorKenneth Davis Jr.andP;  erased what Exxon called a &quot;small number&quot; of tapesrelating to the Exxon Valdez spill.andP;  Since late April, Exxon and otherparties have been under federal court order to preserve all pertinentoil-spill records.andM;Exxon fired Davis on June 9 &quot;as a result of performance problems,&quot; most ofthem unrelated to the tape incident, said Exxon spokesman Les Rogers.andM;Rogers said the erasure was an accident, the tapes were only backups of data,and that Exxon had primary copies of the documents elsewhere.andM;But shortly after the erasure, officials for the state of Alaska voicedskepticism.andP;  &quot;There's a big question in the minds of the public as to whetherit was deliberate or accidental,&quot; said Alaska Attorney General Douglas Baily.andM;&quot;Exxon has made claims in the past that haven't proven true,&quot; said DavidRamseur, press secretary for Alaska's Gov.andP;  Steve Cowper.andP;  &quot;We want to proveto ourselves all the evidence is available for future litigation.&quot;andM;The problem, Alaskan officials said, was that if Exxon erased backup tapes,there was nothing with which to compare the remaining tapes to see ifsensitive files had been erased.andM;In mid-July, the state attorney general's office asked Alaska Superior CourtJudge Brian Shortell to give the state permission to question Exxon employeesunder oath.andP;  The state was armed with an affidavit based on an interview withDavis, in which he claimed he was told to erase the tapes, and that some ofExxon's documents about the spill contain &quot;shocking&quot; information.andM;The judge denied Alaska's request in August, but Davis repeated many of thecharges in a wrongful-dismissal suit filed July 19 in Harris County DistrictCourt in Houston.andP;  Davis claimed other Exxon employees had also erasedoil-spill data, and that he was being made a scapegoat &quot;for the defendant'sgross negligence and/or intentional disregard&quot; of the document-retentionorders.andM;According to the suit, all oil-spill tapes were supposed to have been movedto Room 1385 in Exxon headquarters, but an E-mail memo ordered Davis to eraseover tapes in a tape rack; the memo, however, didn't tell him the tapescontained oil-spill information.andP;  Davis said he does not have a copy of thememo, and Exxon did not submit it with its court papers.andM;Exxon has denied the wrongful-dismissal charges, Rogers said, adding thatDavis had no way of knowing what was on the tapes.andM;Rogers also pointed to discrepancies between the affidavit filed by an Alaskastate investigator who interviewed Davis and the suit filed by Davis himself.andM;For example, the Alaska investigator quoted Davis as saying some of the&quot;shocking&quot; documents were sent to a printer in his office.andP;  Davis' suit,however, does not mention the printout or its contents.andP;  &quot;There was no way hecould make a tape printout,&quot; Rogers said.andP;  &quot;We maintain that was afabrication.&quot;andM;Attorney General Baily, meanwhile, said the state must wait for judges torule on the search for evidence.andP;  Until then, he said, &quot;our hands are tied.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
