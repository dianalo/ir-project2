While Moslem religious leaders haven't come out in praise of in-vitro, or test-tube, fertilization, they vaguely have approved its use in strictly controlled situations.    So, as the government spends almost $60 million a year to curb population growth, thousands of dollars in private money are spent by couples who want children.    &quot;Overpopulation doesn't contradict this idea,&quot; said Hassan el-Deeb of the Ministry of Health. &quot;Every wife wants to become a mother, and 50 or 100 more (people) a year won't affect the population.&quot;    Egypt has 54 million people and gets a million new ones every eight months. It must feed them off just 4% of the land area, the Nile valley. The country imports 60% of its grain.    Religious considerations play a large role in acceptance of the in-vitro technique, or fertilizing an egg outside the womb in a test tube for reimplantation.    Islam has no written laws concerning in-vitro fertilization, but it is taken for granted that only married couples can use it. And to date, Egypt has no sperm or embryo banks, nor can women give birth as surrogates for others, because many clerics and Moslem doctors say these practices risk adultery.    To disobey these religious interpretations would have the effect of removing a doctor's right to practice medicine.    Under Islamic law, an adopted child can't be given the foster parents' name, unless the natural parents are unknown. The adopted child also lacks the full rights of natural offspring, including inheritance. Unless the foster parent specifically bequeaths property to the adopted child in a will, the child gets nothing. Even with the will, however, the child can receive no more than one-third of the bequeathed property.    Couples seeking to avoid those restrictions are resorting to in-vitro fertilization.    The ad hoc moral standards regulating in-vitro fertilization are shared widely by Egypt's Moslems and its 10% Christian minority. But for Moslems, Islamic theologians, known as the ulema, set down the condition that the in-vitro procedure must be performed by a Moslem doctor.    &quot;Islam requires preservation of family lineage for inheritance,&quot; said Sheik Abdallah el-Mashad of al-Azhar Mosque, the Moslem world's highest center of theological learning. &quot;Therefore, the doctor carrying out the in-vitro fertilization must be a trustworthy Moslem believer with a good reputation.&quot;    As head of al-Azhar's Fatwa Council, which interprets Islam's holy book, the Koran, Sheik el-Mashad is empowered to announce opinions on controversial matters. The world's Moslems are expected to follow.    In Cairo's plush suburb of Heliopolis, Mohammed Fayez, co-owner of an in-vitro fertilization center, said his team follows el-Azhar's directions even though they aren't legally binding.    He said the al-Azhar sheiks, therefore, give his clinic no trouble, but it has run into opponents of test-tube baby technology who &quot;are afraid the doctors might do something wrong and mix the specimen. I tell them we can't fully guarantee anything in life.&quot;    The center is one of three major in-vitro clinics in the capital area. Mr. Fayez said the clinic has achieved two pregnancies among about 20 patients since it began late last summer.    He said his clinic charges the equivalent of about $1,450 for the first two attempts at fertilization, and $975 for the next three.    In this Middle Eastern culture typically centered on family life, childlessness spells problems for a couple. Offspring are considered necessary to help in the fields, improve the economic standard of poor families or to keep the wealth of the rich within the family.    &quot;If there is a 1% chance for couples to have their own they will try. Adoption isn't favored,&quot; said Mr. Fayez. </TEXT></DOC>
