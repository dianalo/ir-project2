Nabih Berri, who heads the mainstream Shiite Amal militia, spokein an interview with The Associated Press after the Islamic Jihad,a pro-Iranian fundamentalist faction, warned it would punishAmerican hostages it is holding.   The Islamic Jihad threat was in retaliation for Friday's Israeliair raids on Lebanon that killed 21 people and injured 34.Officials had said 16 people were killed in the attacks but policereported five more bodies were found in the rubble Saturday in thesoutheastern town of Mashgara, one of the main targets of theIsraeli raids.   Israeli warplanes flew over the pro-Iranian stronghold ofBaalbek in eastern Lebanon Saturday but no attacks were reported.   Berri's Syrian-backed militia has been locked in a fiercestruggle with pro-Iranian fundamentalists for mastery of the Shiitecommunity. It has no influence on the kidnappers.   In Milan, Italy, police said Saturday they arrested a Lebanesewoman at the airport who was carrying pictures of three Americanhostages in Lebanon in a false bottom in her suitcase.   The woman stopped Thursday was carrying photos of TerryAnderson, Thomas Sutherland and Alann Steen to be given to anItalian businessman, said Fortunato Finoli, deputy director of theMilan police anti-terrorist unit.   She also carried a handwritten letter signed by Steen, he said.She was arrested and charged with carrying $1,000 in counterfeitU.S. bills and 50 grams of heroin, Finoli said.   Police refused to say who was to ultimately receive the picturesand documents, or why they were being sent.   They said the U.S. Embassy was notified.   Finoli said the woman, a Maronite Catholic identified as AlineIbrahim Rizkalah, 36, was arrested before Islamic Jihad, or Islamicholy war, threatened the U.S. hostages Friday and accused theUnited States of giving Israel advance approval of the air attack.   In Lebanon, Berri said Lebanese ``are against America's policy,against America's support of Israel and against the Americanadministration. But we are not at all against the Americancitizens.''   He called the kidnapping ``an unjustified, unforgivable crime.''   In its statement, the Islamic Jihad said: ``The criminal Americamust realize it will not get away with what it has done, especiallyin connection with the hostages we hold.''   The group holds Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent forThe Associated Press, and Sutherland, acting dean of agriculture atthe American University of Beirut.   Anderson is the longest-held foreign hostage in Lebanon. He waskidnapped March 16, 1985. Sutherland, of Fort Collins, Colo., wasseized three months later. The Jan. 24, 1987 abduction of Steen, ateacher at Beirut University College, has been claimed by thepro-Iranian Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine.   They are among nine Americans believed held by pro-Iranianextremist factions linked to Hezbollah, or Party of God, the mainmilitia challenging Berri's Amal among Lebanon's Shiites. Othersbelieved held are three Britons, an Irishman and an Italian.   Asked if he believed the foreign hostages would be releasedsoon, Berri said that would happen ``only if deals were struckbetween the kidnappers and the hostages' governments.''   In Mashgara, Hezbollah on Saturday buried eight air raid victims.   About 1,500 mourners shouted ``Death to America, the greatSatan!'' and ``Death to Israel!'' as they paraded flag-drapedcoffins through the streets. ``The more you kill us the more wewill fight!''</TEXT></DOC>
