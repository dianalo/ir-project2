WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Kremlin on Wednesday installed an Armenian asthe Communist Party chief of a disputed territory in an apparenteffort to end ethnic protests in Soviet Armenia that a dissidentsaid involved 200,000 people.   Soviet authorities also ordered an end to the unrest.   Protesters in Yerevan, the Armenian capital, want theNagorno-Karabakh region in neighboring Azerbaidzhan turned over toArmenia, smallest of the Soviet Union's 15 republics.   In another apparent concession, Moscow radio said Armenian partyleaders would ask the Central Committee in Moscow to discussNagorno-Karabakh in a meeting on nationality policy. No suchmeeting has been scheduled, but Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachevproposed one last week.   Yerevan was the scene Tuesday and Wednesday of industrialstrikes, school boycotts and public demonstrations said to be thelargest in the Soviet Union's 70-year history.   In the Baltic republic of Estonia on Wednesday, there was arally on an national anniversary day, with demonstrators shouting``Get the Russians out!'' according to a dissident.   The demonstrations were the latest in a recent burst of ethnicconflicts in a huge nation that stretches from Europe through Asiaand encompasses more than 100 nationalities, under a centralgovernment dominated by ethnic Russians.   Paruyr Ayrikyan, an Armenian activist who spent 17 years inlabor camps and internal exile for national activities, said200,000 people gathered in the central square of Yerevan.   He said in a telephone interview that they chanted ``We want asession!'' _ demanding that a special session of the republic'slegislature decide whether Nagorno-Karabakh should become Armenian.   Western reporters could not travel to Yerevan immediately, andtelephone contact was not always possible.   About 150,000 people, most of them Armenians, live inNagorno-Karabakh, the disputed autonomous region in the CaucasusMountains whose 1,760 square miles make it smaller than Delaware.Annexation would increase Armenia's area by 14 percent and itspopulation, about 3.4 million, by 4 percent.   Last fall, Armenian sources said more than 2,000 ethnicArmenians marched in the region, just north of Turkey, to protestmistreatment by Azeris, the dominant ethnic group in Azerbaidzhan.   The party Central Committee has declared Nagorno-Karabakh shouldremain part of Azerbaidzhan, which caused Armenian protests andbegan an argument about whether the party has the right to decidesuch issues.   In a dispatch Wednesday night, the official news agency Tasssaid the regional party organization named a 56-year-old Armenian,Genrikh Pogosyan, party leader in Nagorno-Karabakh.   While Tass said Pogosyan was Armenian and born inNagorno-Karabakh, it did not give the nationality of hispredecessor. The surname of the former leader, Boris Kevorkov,indicates he is Russian or Azeri.   The agency also referred to a ``passive, wait-and-see attitudeof the autonomous region's party and government bodies whoseleadership had displayed a superficial approach to evaluating the ... situation and the existing sentiments.   Tass said party leaders plan to take all necessary steps torestore order in Yerevan, effectively declaring an end to thedispute.   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov confirmed therewere mass demonstrations in Yerevan. He described them as peacefuland said he did not know the number of protesters.   Arikyan, the Armenian activist, said protesters were angered byCentral Committee interference in a territorial question, which hesaid the Soviet constitution defines as a matter for thegovernment, not the party.   In a telephone interview from Yerevan, he said major industrieswere crippled by strikes Wednesday and virtually all students atcolleges and technical institutes boycotted classes.   Ethnic tensions have arisen with increasing frequency over thepast year as Soviets embrace Gorbachev's call for ``glasnost,'' ormore openness about some social problems.   Another national demonstration was reported in Tallinn, thecapital of Estonia. Wednesday was the 70th anniversary of theestablishment of an independent Estonia, which was annexed by theSoviet Union in 1940.   Alexander Podrabinek, a Moscow-based dissident, said 2,500-3,000people gathered at a Tallinn landmark and shouted ``Independence toEstonia!'' and ``Get the Russians out!''   Plainclothes agents photographed the demonstrators and militiasurrounded them, bringing in a bus with a loudspeaker that blaredmusic and propaganda to drown out the demonstrators. No one wasdetained and the demonstrators dispersed after about three hours,he said.   Podrabinek said he received his information from a correspondentin Tallinn for the underground journal Express Chronicle, whichPodrabinek edits.   Earlier, Tass reported there was an official rally in Tallinn toprotest what they considered U.S. provocation of nationalistactivists.   Street demonstrations occurred last summer in Estonia and itsneighbors Latvia and Lithuania, which were annexed at the same time.   In the Central Asian republic of Kazakhstan, at least 3,000people rioted Dec. 17-18, 1986, in the capital, Alma Ata, toprotest appointment of an ethnic Rusian to replace a Kazakh as therepublic's party leader.   In a Tass report Tuesday, the government acknowledged the unrestin Armenia and said it was not in the public interest.   Gerasimov said the government believes ``things should remain asthey are now'' in terms of which republic governs Nagorno-Karabakh.He said he had spoken with officials in Armenia by telephone, buthad no more information than that contained in media reports.   Izvestia, the government newspaper, recommended more publicdiscussion of the dispute. It acknowledged a ``mass meeting'' ofprotesters in Yerevan, student boycotts and involvement of nationalparty figures in seeking a solution.   Wednesday's edition of the Communist Party newspaper Pravdacarried the Tass report, but no commentary on the events.   Ayrikyan, who said he spoke from an apartment 100 yards from theprotest site, said Wednesday: ``There are at least 200,000 peoplein front of the Opera House. I've never seen anything like it.   He said two members of the Central Committee secretariat,Vladimir I. Dolgikh and Anatoly I. Lukyanov, arrived in Yerevan onTuesday ``to calm the people'' in the city 1,100 miles south ofMoscow.   Dolgikh addressed the protesters Tuesday, the Armenian activistsaid.   On Wednesday, Lukyanov and Dolgikh asked the demonstrators tosend a small delegation to party headquarters in Yerevan to discussthe dispute, Ayrikyan said.</TEXT></DOC>
