Haney, vice presidentof fabricated reinforcing steel products; and J.C. Hogue, vicepresident of employee relations.   Gres said the company disclosed that its top managers wereconsidering making an offer because ``there have been a number ofrumors as to various things that might be happening, in particularabout a management leveraged buyout.''
