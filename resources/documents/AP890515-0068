The move came a day after the Cabinet voted 20-6 to approve aplan for elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip tochoose Palestinian representatives for talks with Israel on aninterim settlement.   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir considers the plan a step towardpermanent peace, but many Palestinians criticize it for not linkingballoting to the eventual creation of an independent Palestinianstate.   In the occupied lands, Palestinians observed a general striketoday to protest the displacement of more than 600,000 Palestiniansafter Israel was founded on May 15, 1948.   In the West Bank village of Beita, residents stoned seven Jewishsettler who were hiking, the army said. The settlers fled to anearby hill and repeatedly fired in the air before soldiers rescuedthem. No injuries were reported.   Settler leader Benny Katzover charged Monday's hikers showed toomuch restraint. ``They had five guns. The fact that no Arabs werewounded is a sign of weakness,'' Katzover said on Israel radio.   Also Monday, new army figures showed 61 Palestinians have beenkilled by plastic bullets since the ammunition was introduced inAugust.   Gen. Ehud Barak, the army deputy chief of staff, was quoted byIsrael radio as saying the plastic bullets helped reduce the numberof Palestinians killed in army gunfire from 204 in the first eightmonths of the uprising to 151 in the following eight months.   The Associated Press has counted 474 Palestinian deaths, mostwhen Israeli soldiers fired on stone-throwers, since the rebellionbegan in December 1987. Twenty-one Israelis also have died.   In the West Bank, the army blew up six houses today in the cityof Nablus, the refugee camps of Balata and Arrub, and the villageof Deir Nidham. Troops sealed four houses in Nablus and three inHebron.   The homeowners in Nablus were accused of killing two allegedcollaborators, the army said. Arabs have killed more than 40Palestinians in the uprising.   Suspects in Arrub allegedly fired at an army unit in February1988 but the bullets struck a local woman who died of her wounds.The Deir Nidham man allegedly stabbed and injured a border policeofficer in February.   Western nations, including the United States, have condemnedhouse demolitions and sealings as a violation of the right to dueprocess because punishment usually comes before suspects are tried.   An army spokeswoman could not say what legal proceedings werebeing taken against those whose houses were destroyed or sealedtoday.   More than 170 houses have been demolished and more than 70others sealed during the uprising, according to army figures.   Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna, army commander of the West Bank,defended the practice.   ``These are murder gangs, and some of them got their orders fromoutside to carry out murders of people considered to be helpingIsrael,'' he said on Israel radio. ``We won't allow this to happen.We will punish them severely.''   In southern Israel, meanwhile, additional police were deployedto prevent attacks on Palestinians from the Gaza Strip driving totheir jobs in the Israeli coastal cities of Ashkelon and Ashdod.   Hundreds of Israelis from the two cities in the past week havestoned Arab-owned cars to avenge the slaying of an army sergeantand the disappearance of a second soldier, both blamed onPalestinians.   On Sunday, three masked assailants entered an Ashkelon bakeryand beat two Palestinian workers who were hospitalized briefly.</TEXT></DOC>
