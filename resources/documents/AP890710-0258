Other major commercial banks were expected to follow suit incutting the rate, which is a benchmark used to set interest on avariety of consumer and business credit.   The decrease _ which was effective immediately _ had been widelyexpected and comes amid building perception in the financial marketsthat the Federal Reserve is seeking looser credit policies inresponse to a slowdown in economic growth.   Short-term interest rates in the bond market have been fallingsteadily as a result.   Bond and stock prices were moderatly higher following today'sannouncement, while the dollar was little changed.   ``If the current interest rates scenario continues it willbenefit a lot of people ... especially those looking to buy ahouse,'' said Kevin Flanagan, a money market economist with DeanWitter Reynolds Inc.   Because the prime rate reflects a bank's costs of borrowingmoney, including interest it pays on savings accounts orcertificates of deposit, it trails more subtle increases in otherinterest rates in the credit markets.   Still, the rate is watched closely because bankers use it as abasis for calculating loans to businesses and for determining manytypes of fixed and adjustable-rate consumer loans. Mortgage ratesare not included in that category.   The prime stood at 10.5 percent at the start of 1989. The banksraised it twice in February to 11.5 percent, then lowered a halfpercentage point on June 5. Those movements reflected changingconcerns about economic growth and inflation.   The latest decrease puts the key lending rate at its lowest levelsince Feb. 10, when it was raised from 10.5 percent to 11 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
