Havel, Czecholovakia's best-known dissident, was charged withinciting people to participate in the banned Jan. 16 rally and forobstructing the duty of a public official.   On the first count he could have been sentenced to a maximum termof two years, on the second to another six months in prison. Havelwas found guilty of both offenses in a one-day trial.   The prosecution of Havel and other opposition activists has goneon despite widespread criticism at home, in the East bloc and theWest that the communist leaders are dealing too harshly withdissent. Seven other activists from the Charter 77 human rightscommittee and other independent movements also went on trial today.   Authorities banned a number of Western diplomats andrepresentatives from human rights organizations from the trials.   Havel, 52, who helped found the Charter 77 movement, has beenharassed and detained by authorities almost constantly since his1975 open letter to Communist Party leader Gustav Husak accusedauthorities of creating ``a bureaucratic order of grey monotony thatstifles all individuality.''   Havel was convicted of sedition and sentenced to four years injail in 1979. Authorities have banned his plays, which are widelyacclaimed in productions abroad.   Earlier today, more than 100 Havel sympathizers had jammed asmall stairwell leading to the courtroom, loudly cheering him policeled him to the trial.   Havel's brother, Ivan, said Havel did not take part in a Jan. 16flower-laying ceremony in a downtown Prague square, but was detainedon the square an hour later.   The seven other defendants _ all activists with Charter 77 andother independent groups _ face hooliganism charges in connectionwith the Jan. 16 gathering. The charges carry a maximum two-yearjail sentence.   The seven were detained after seeking to lay flowers in memory ofJan Palach, the student who burned himself to death 20 years earlierto protest the Soviet-led invasion that quashed communist reforms inCzechoslovakia.   The arrests came during a week of protests that were the largestin Prague since Palach's death.   Ota Veverka, one of the seven Charter 77 human rights groupactivists being tried, said what happened on Wenceslas Square ``wasnot a criminal act but an assault by police.''   Most of the defendants said they came separately to the square tolay flowers in Palach's memory and no demonstration was planned.   More than 2,000 intellectuals have signed a petition calling forthe government to release the dissidents.   It was the first time since the 1968 invasion that establishmentintellectuals sided with opposition activists in public.   The trials also have drawn an official protest from the HungarianWriters' Union, as well as criticism from the United States, Britainand other Western governments and groups.   Last month, NATO, Warsaw Pact, and 12 other European nationsagreed on new human rights accords in Vienna.   Britain and the United States have charged that the trialsviolate the spirit of those accords. Nine independent groups inCzechoslovakia have appealed to all 35 states that signed the newaccords to protest the trials.   Those on trial are Charter 77 activists Sasha Vondra and JanaSternova and independent activists Veverka, Nemec, Jana Petrova,Stanislav Penc and Petr Placak.   Dana Nemcova, another Charter 77 activist, has been hospitalizedwith an undisclosed ailment and will stand trial separately later,the official CTK news agency reported.</TEXT></DOC>
