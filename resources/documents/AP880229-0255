(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   For more than 40 years, scores ofMexican-Americans have gone off to war from a winding drive of tinywood-frame houses perched on a hillside rising from an old railyard in this Illinois town.   Eight have returned in caskets.   And since 1968, the street has been named Hero Street U.S.A. inhonor of the 110 young warriors who have left it for the armedforces since 1941. Now a move is under way to get Congress to namethe former dirt path a national monument.   For Joe Munos and his family, life on Hero Street always meantserving their country. Not only did Munos and his three brothersall fight for the United States _ his younger brother Johnny diedin Korea _ but his three sons and his daughter joined the armedforces, as well as his grandson.   ``That's the tradition of Hero Street,'' Munos says. ``It mustbe in our blood. It's an honor for me to be a veteran of foreignwars.''   For Georgia Sandoval Herrera, growing up on Hero Street meantwatching a half-dozen brothers leave during World War II and seeingtwo return in caskets. Brothers Joe and Frank died 10 months apartand portraits of them in uniform still hang on her living room wall.   ``It seemed like a ghost town during the war because so many ofour boys were gone,'' she recalls. ``But we were one big family onHero Street. The losses pulled us together. We're still a veryclose community.   ``My son says, `why don't we move?' And I say the only place I'dwant to live is Hero Street. There's no place like Hero Street.''   Another Sandoval family sent seven boys into World War II andsuffered one death.   Those kinds of statistics are common on Hero Street.   No other single block in America has made so great a sacrifice,according to local officials. Although the Defense Department can'tconfirm the claim, it's never been disputed in 20 years.   A memorial park was built on the site in 1971 and now a cityalderman is leading the drive to have Congress declare Hero Streeta national monument as a tribute to all who died in service _especially immigrant soldiers.   ``These men walked into this country and picked up arms withouta complaint,'' says Alderman Joe Terronez, 58. ``Some weren't evencitizens when they joined the armed forces. This is a great storyabout great heroes and it should be a national monument.''   Located between Billy Goat Bluff and Honey Creek, Hero Street isa small Mexican barrio that winds its way back up a dead-end hollownear the rail yard in this town of 7,200.   Some of its 36 tiny bungalows sit precariously on the steepterrace of the bluff while others are perched just above the creekand appear to be sinking into the gully.   Many of the wood-frame homes are long and narrow, like therailroad boxcars they replaced. Until a few years ago, the streetwas a dirt path that turned to mud and trapped hearses as theybrought home dead soldiers.   When Terronez was growing up, Hero Street was simply 2nd Streetand a ``tough neighborhood.'' Living conditions were poor for thelarge Mexican families crowded into the cramped houses.   The Mexicans were brought to Silvis early this century by therailroads who were looking for cheap labor. Originally, they livedin boxcars in the nearby rail yard but were moved to 2nd Streetwhen townspeople complained about the growing Mexican population inthe yard.   ``This is a story of our parents coming to the United States andadopting it,'' Terronez says. ``Although we were all viewed asaliens, the boys of Hero Street proved this was their country.''   The fight for national monument status is more than just abattle for recognition of the contribution made by eight deadsoldiers or even 110 men and women who joined the armed forces.   For Terronez, it epitomizes the struggle of Hispanic Americanseverywhere for appreciation and respect as first-class citizens.He's enlisted the help of U.S. Rep. Lane Evans, a Democrat fromnearby Rock Island, in achieving national recognition in Congress.   Hero Street's residents hope for tangible benefits fromelevating the street to a national monument.   Federal money would be available for maintaining the memorial,built on a bluff to resemble a Mayan temple. Residents also hope itwould become a tourist attraction after placement on national parkssystem maps.   Steve Vetzner, an aide in Evans' Washington office, said thecongressman plans to work with the Illinois delegation to get somesort of designation for Hero Street, such as a national monument,historic site or historic landmark.   ``Let's be honest _ naturally this would be a shot in the arm toHispanics,'' Terronez says. ``Sometimes, we feel we aresecond-class citizens. But when you look at the blood shed byHispanics on that one street you know we are real Americans. Itwould be a source of great pride for all Mexican-Americans.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, March 13</NOTE></DOC>
