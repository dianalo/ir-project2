DALE NELSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former White House chief of staff Donald T.Regan says that in the confusion following the 1981 assassinationattempt on President Reagan he erroneously told Cabinet membersthat presidential press secretary James Brady had died.   The president, Brady, Secret Service agent Timothy J. McCarthyand a Washington police officer, Thomas K. Delahanty, were woundedin the assassination attempt outside the Washington Hilton.   John W. Hinckley Jr. was arrested but was found innocent byreason of insanity. He is in St. Elizabeths Hospital, a mentalinstitution in Washington.   There were erroneous news reports at the time that Brady haddied.   In his new book, ``For the Record: From Wall Street toWashington,'' Regan, who was secretary of the treasury at the timeof the attempt on Reagan's life, included what he said were notesthat he made a few days after the March 30, 1981, shooting.   He said in the notes that he received information from theSecret Service, which is part of the Treasury Department, andrelayed it to other members of the Cabinet gathered in the WhiteHouse Situation Room.   ``An unfortunate message came to me from the Secret Service, andit caused confusion and consternation,'' Regan said. ``At the endof a message describing the president's condition, someone hadadded the words `Brady died.' I announced this sad news to astunned group.''   He said Richard Allen, the president's national securityadviser, asked for a moment of silent prayer.   ``Apparently someone relayed this information to the group atthe hospital and we got word back that it was not true,'' Regansaid.   In his book, ``Speaking Out: Inside the Reagan White House,''former presidential spokesman Larry Speakes gives substantially thesame account and adds that Regan relayed the word to Howard Baker,then the Senate majority leader and now the White House chief ofstaff, at his Senate office.</TEXT></DOC>
