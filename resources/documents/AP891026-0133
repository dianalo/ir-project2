Because he plans to invoke his constitutional right againstself-incrimination, Pierce, through his attorneys, asked the panelto cancel a hearing Friday and another session next week at whichhe has been subpoenaed to testify.   Pierce, who headed the Department of Housing and UrbanDevelopment throughout the Reagan administration, said that forcinghim to appear would subject him to unnecessary adverse publicityand be ``punitive.''   It was not immediately clear whether the subcommittee wouldgrant the request, but a congressional aide said there were noplans to cancel Friday's hearing.   Pierce's attorneys, in a letter to the House Government Affairssubcommittee on employment and housing:   ``Upon the advice of counsel, Mr. Pierce will again invoke hisrights under the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution. Mr. Pierce isconcerned that there continues to be an atmosphere wherein heremains a target of the subcommittee hearings.''   The attorneys, Paul L. Perito and Robert Plotkin, asked thesubpoenas be vacated.   The stalemate between Pierce and the subcommittee has broughtthe investigation to a crossroads. The former secretary and threeof his deputies have refused to cooperate with the panel and somemembers say it should move past the investigative phase and work onreform initiatives.   But its chairman, Rep. Thomas Lantos, D-Calif., has raised thepossibility of granting immunity to two former Pierce deputies whoalso have refused to testify in hopes their accounts would shedlight on Pierce's role in fraud, mismanagement andinfluence-peddling at HUD.   After Pierce refused to testify last month, several subcommitteemembers questioned whether he had waived his constitutionalprotections when he appeared before the panel voluntarily in May.   Pierce's attorneys disputed such interpretations of the law andHouse rules and Lantos said he would rule on the question. Heinformed Pierce's attorneys of his finding today, but they declinedto discuss it.   A congressional source, however, indicated that Lantos hadconcluded he could compel Pierce to testify but was inclined not todo so.   Pierce's latest move comes as his attorneys stepped up theireffort to defend him by challenging the sworn account of a formerHUD official, Shirley Wiseman, who said Pierce personally orderedher to fund a North Carolina project over the objections of severaldepartment officials.   Prior to her testimony Pierce, in his initial appearance beforethe subcommittee, said he took no direct role in funding decisions.Lawmakers who have accused the former secretary of misleading themand possibly commiting perjury often refer to Wiseman's account.   In 1985, when HUD's inspector general questioned Wiseman aboutthe project, she said Pierce's top aide spoke to her aboutapproving it but never mentioned a conversation with Pierce,according to the notes of the investigator who interviewed her anda memo he prepared for Pierce's lawyers.   Perito said Pierce acknowledges supporting the development, theconversion of a hosiery mill into housing, but cannot recall theconversation she told Congress took place.   ``If she didn't mention the call from the secretary months afterthe project was funded, it seems strange that she can remember itso clearly years later,'' Perito said. He said the subcommitteestaff had access to the same documents before it questioned Wisemanbut never asked her about the seeming inconsistency.   Although Congress may never get to question Pierce again abouthis role at HUD, it appears likely he will issue a written rebuttalof allegations raised in congressional hearings and media accountsof fraud, mismanagement and influence peddling during hiseight-year tenure.   ``My client certainly has a story to tell and wants to tell hisstory but needs to decide the how and when and where of doing so,''said Perito.</TEXT></DOC>
