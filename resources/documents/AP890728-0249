But Judge Warren Bentz said Thursday that he found the motionrequesting the pay hike ``offensive'' because it referred to thecompany's recent profitability. He noted that there are about $1.2billion in bankruptcy claims ``on which not a nickel has beenpaid.''   Union employees, who haven't had a wage hike in a decade, make aminimum of $9 an hour.   Bentz initially threatened to tie the wage increase to atwo-month deadline for the company and creditors to submit a finalplan of bankruptcy reorganization. The steelmaker filed for Chapter11 protection from its creditors in 1985.   ``How soon can I get a plan finalized,'' he asked companyattorneys. ``Why can't you do this in two months?''   A major issue in the reorganization is a new labor agreementwith the United Steelworkers to replace one that expires 10 daysafter the company emerges from bankruptcy court protection.   The union has insisted it could not negotiate a new contractuntil a long-running dispute is resolved with the federal PensionBenefit Guaranty Corp.   But Bentz said that issue, which is before U.S. District JudgePaul Simmons, could take years to solve.   ``You'll have the same uncertainties a year from now, two yearsfrom now,'' he said. ``You might as well get on with it.''   Paul Whitehead, an attorney for the union, said the interimraise was requested after the USW learned the company was grantingmerit pay increases of about 5 percent to salaried employees.</TEXT></DOC>
