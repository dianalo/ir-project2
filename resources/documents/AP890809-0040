The Ariane 4 rocket lifted off Tuesday following a brief halt inthe countdown seven seconds before launching so technicians couldcheck out a problem in the rocket's guidance system.   The launching followed the U.S. space shuttle Columbia'ssuccessful liftoff earlier in the day. Little is known about theU.S. mission because its mission was to launch a spy satellite.   It was the fifth U.S. shuttle flight since September, whenflights resumed following the 1986 Challenger disaster in whichseven astronauts died.   The Ariane program also experienced a break of some monthsfollowing the failure of its 18th mission. Launches were resumedSept. 16, 1987.   Ariane 4's mission is the 33rd by Arianespace, a partnership of11 European countries and the world leader in the lucrativecommercial launch field.   Ariane 4, first flown June 15, 1988, is the latest version ofthe reliable rocket series developed under the aegis of theEuropean Space Agency. The rocket has six possible configurationstailored to individual payloads and is capable of carrying 4,190pounds to 9,260 pounds into orbit.   Tuesday's mission will carry a payload of 7,186 pounds intogeostationary orbit, including the satellite Hipparcos, a EuropeanSpace Agency mission dedicated to the precise measurement of thepositions and motions of the stars.   The second satellite is the TV-SAT-2 for the West GermanBundespost telecommunications authority. The direct broadcastingsatellite is to replace TV-SAT-1, which was abandoned in November1987 after a failure in the deployment mechanism of its solar array.   Arianespace, which has international orders for 74 launchesworth $2.3 billion, plans to send a rocket into space once a monthbetween October and January. About 47 percent of the orders are forEuropean projects, and the rest are for clients outside Europe,according to Arianespace.</TEXT></DOC>
