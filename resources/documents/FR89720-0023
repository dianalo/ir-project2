The order is effective under theAgricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674),hereinafter referred to as the Act.This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12291 and DepartmentalRegulation 1512-1 and has been determined to be a ``non-major'' rule undercriteria contained therein.Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act(RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) hasconsidered the economic impact of this proposed rule on small entities.The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of businesssubject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be undulyor disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to theAct, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought aboutthrough group action of essentially small entities acting on their ownbehalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.There are approximately 45 handlers of California pears under this marketingorder, and approximately 300 pear producers in California. Small agriculturalproducers have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR121.2) as those having annual gross revenues for the last three years ofless than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined asthose whose gross annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. The majorityof the handlers and producers may be classified as small entities.Marketing Order 917 requires that the assessment rate for a particularfiscal year shall apply to all assessable pears handled from the beginningof such year. An annual budget of expenses is prepared by the Committeeand submitted to the U.S. Department of Agriculture for approval. The membersof the Committee are handlers and producers of the regulated commodity.They are familiar with the committee's needs and with the costs for goods,services, and personnel in their local areas, and are thus in a positionto formulate an appropriate budget. The 1989-90 budget was formulated anddiscussed in public meetings. Thus, all directly affected persons had anopportunity to participate and provide input.The assessment rate recommended by the Committee is derived by dividinganticipated expenses by expected shipments of the commodity (e.g., pounds,tons, boxes, cartons, etc.). Because that rate is applied to actual shipments,it must be established at a rate which will produce sufficient income topay the Committee's expected expenses. Recommended budgets and rates ofassessment are usually acted upon by the Committee before a season starts,and expenses are incurred on a continuous basis. Therefore, budget andassessment rate approvals must be expedited so that the Committee willhave authority to incur reasonable expenses and have funds to pay theirexpenses.The Committee met June 28, 1989, and unanimously recommended 1989-90 fiscalyear expenditures of $912,390 and an assessment rate of $0.22 per 36 poundcarton or equivalent of assessable pears shipped under M.O. 917. For comparison,1988-89 fiscal year expenditures were $698,719 and the assessment ratewas $0.22 per carton or equivalent.The major expenditure item this year is $733,800 for advertising, promotion,and food safety compared to $556,737 in 1988-89. The remaining expenses,which are primarily for program administration, are budgeted at about lastyear's amounts. A total of $10,000 is included for uncollected assessmentaccounts.Estimated total income for 1989-90 would amount to $800,060, includingassessment income of $786,060 based on shipments of 3,573,000 cartons offresh pears, $2,000 from the California Department of Food and Agriculture,and $12,000 from other sources such as interest earned on the reserve fund.The reserve fund of $249,095 would be sufficient to cover the anticipateddeficit.While this proposed action would impose some additional costs on handlers,the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on all handlers. Someof the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costswould be significantly offset by the benefits derived from the operationof the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determinedthat this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities.Based on the foregoing, it is found and determined that a comment periodof less than 30 days is appropriate because the budget and assessment rateapprovals for the pear program need to be expedited so the committee hasauthority to incur reasonable expenses and has sufficient funds to payits expenses, which are incurred on a continuous basis.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 917</ITAG>Marketing agreements and orders, Pears, Plums, Peaches and California.For the reasons set forth in the preamble, it is proposed that andSection;917.253 be added as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 917_FRESH PEARS, PLUMS, AND PEACHES GROWN IN CALIFORNIA</ITAG>1.
