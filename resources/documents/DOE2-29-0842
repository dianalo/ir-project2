The water jets were foundto reduce the required cutting force on the picks even without a preliminaryslit cut. The parameters studied were: jet pressure 5-25 MPa; slice thickness5-15 mm; nozzle diameter 0.5-1.9 mm; cutting speed 10-40 m/min; jet/pickdistance 0-100 mm. The rock cut had a compression strength of 15-25 MPa.Processing of the results obtained led to the conclusion that a maximumdecrease in the pick cutting force would be achieved with an optimumratio of jet/pick distance to slice thickness of 2-3; the decrease comparedto a purely mechanical cutting system would be 30-35%.</TEXT></DOC>
