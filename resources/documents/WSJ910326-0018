Many analysts have urged investors to buy shares duringthe recent weakness, saying stocks should flourish in thelow-growth, low-inflation environment that should emerge asthe economy recovers from recession.</LP><TEXT>   The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed steadily early inthe session, running up 25 points before eroding again latein the day. Stocks began falling as bond prices weakened.   The industrials closed a meager 6.93 higher at 2865.84,but broader market measures posted heftier gains. Standard andamp;Poor's 500-stock index added 2.35 to 369.83, and the New YorkStock Exchange composite index rose 1.26 to 202.39, with theaverage price per share up 22 cents. The Dow Jones EquityMarket Index gained 2.41 to 345.04.   Big Board advancers led decliners, 952 to 610. Volumetotaled 153,920,000 shares, compared with 160,890,000 sharesFriday.   A rebound in technology stocks helped lead the markethigher. But the session was marked by a late turnaround intobacco stocks, which were strong gainers early on.   What sent tobacco stocks reeling were concerns stemmingfrom the Supreme Court's decision to review adeath-from-smoking case. The plaintiff is seeking damagesfrom several cigarette companies for the death of his motherfrom cigarette smoking. The industry's stocks managed to holdonto strong gains until Fitch Investors Service highlightedthe risks the case poses to tobacco companies in a reportreleased shortly after 2:30 p.m. EST. After that, tobaccoshare prices quickly tumbled.   Philip Morris, which had seen a high of 70 3/8 earlier inthe day, tumbled 2 5/8 to 66 7/8; American Brands rose to 461/2 before sliding back to 44 1/8, down 1 7/8; and RJRNabisco, which had gained 7/8, ended with a loss of 1/4 at 113/4.   Prudential Securities tobacco analyst John McMillin toldhis firm's sales force that the tobacco stocks would probablybe poor performers pending the outcome of the case. While theodds favored the tobacco companies in the case, theuncertainty could be enough to damp interest in the stocks,he said.   While individual stocks continue to get hit, many analystsremain bullish on the market. Still, some market watchershave expressed concern that a weak economic recovery willkeep corporate profits from rebounding enough to drive shareprices higher.   But Steven G. Einhorn, chairman of the investment policycommittee at Goldman Sachs, said he believes earnings shouldrecover by the third quarter of this year, even in a slowgrowth environment. He noted that the Federal Reserve isfeeding the economy with lower interest rates, whileinflation has been held in check. Mr. Einhorn said those twofactors are enough to keep the market moving.   &quot;Stocks do well when you have a friendly Fed and moderateinflation,&quot; he said. He added that growth stocks -- those ofcompanies that show strong, steady earnings increases -- arelikely to be the best performers in the months ahead, becausetheir results will stand out in a slow-growth environment.   Growth stocks that Einhorn likes include Merck andBristol-Myers Squibb in the drug group; Kellogg, ConAgra,General Mills and Sara Lee in the food group; Gillette,Helene Curtis, and Colgate-Palmolive in the personal-caregroup; Gap and Wal-Mart Stores in the retailing group; AppleComputer in the technology group, and Philip Morris in thetobacco group.</TEXT></DOC>
