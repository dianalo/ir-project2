Soldiers said heavy fighting had broken out on the Salanghighway, just north of Kabul on the southern slope of the massiveHindu Kush mountains. For the past three nights, government forceshave launched dozens of Soviet-made Katyusha rockets at the highwayfrom bases in Kabul.   In Pakistan, the private news agency Afghan Press reported thatgovernment planes had bombed a 40-mile stretch of the highway topush through U.N. supplies headed for Kabul. The rebel alliance'sofficial news organ said, however, it could not confirm the attacks.   The government troops said more than 1,500 trucks carrying foodand weapons were backed up on the highway. They said shipments offuel and food from Harytan, on the Soviet border, had stopped andmore than 18,000 metric tons of gasoline and oil are waiting at theborder town for shipment.   A U.N. official said some of the supplies on the Salang roadwere from a U.N. shipment of Finnish aid which entered Afghanistanlast week. But he said it took up only several trucks. Most of theaid is going to poor families in northern Afghanistan.   In the capital, government forces have been launching scores ofrockets north in the direction of the highway. On Friday night thesky was streaked red with flames from the rocket boosters as theysped north. Seconds later the sky would be bright orange, withexplosions lighting up the black hills.   Government and private markets have been without flour, the maingrain of Afghanistan, since mid-week. The city, however, is not inimmediate danger. Silos holding 50,000 metric tons of grain arereportedly full.   The Salang road is the only land route through which asubstantial amount of commodities have passed recently. The roadeast to Jalalabad is ``open one day, closed the next,'' said onesoldier. The road south to Logram is effectively closed togovernment traffic as is the road west to Herat.   Hundreds of Antonov-12 supply planes from the Soviet Union havearrived at Kabul's international airport over the past few days.But each plane can only carry about 30 tons each.   Gasoline prices are skyrocketing in the city, going as high as6,500 Afghanis ($13.25) a gallon. When asked where the flour is,merchants at food markets put ther fingers to their lips and blowimaginary dust from their nails.   ``It's gone with the wind,'' said one trader, sitting on a bagof rice in his converted ship container which he uses as a store.   It could not be immediately determined which rebel group wascarrying out the attacks on the Salang road, which primarily is thedomain of mujahedeen commander ahmad shah masoud of the powerfuljamiat-i-islami rebel group.   Masoud has pledged not to attack non-military traffic, but therival hezb-i-islami group of fundamentalist gulbaddin hekmatyar hassaid it wants to cut all supplies to kabul, forcing people to flee.Hezb guerrillas operate to a limited extent along the lower salang,close to the capital.   The fighting appeared to be part of a recent increase in rebelassaults against the government.   Fighting over the southeastern town of Khost has intensifiedover the last month with reports of rebel gains. The guerrillas gotso close to the city in late September that the government wasforced to kill its own troops with Soviet-made SCUD missiles whenit wiped out rebel positions, a diplomat said.   The diplomat, who comes from a socialist country with goodrelations with Afghanistan, cited a government military source forthe information.   Observers in Kabul said the current military activity appearedto indicate the rebels were returning to the hit-and-run startegythey used during the decade-long Soviet military intervention.   Rebel attempts to adopt conventional military tactics and takethe eastern city of Jalalabad earlier this year failed.</TEXT></DOC>
