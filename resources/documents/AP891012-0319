Chris Longridge, vice president of sales at Boeing CommercialAirplanes, said the show of confidence on the ninth day of a strikeby the International Association of Machinists and AerospaceWorkers was appreciated.   ``Boeing is happy with the good relationship our companies haveenjoyed over the years, and we look forward to working closely withNorthwest's new management to further strengthen those ties,''Longridge said.   Striking machinists saw the order as more evidence that they'reneeded.   ``It's wonderful. It means we'll have more work for a long timeto come,'' said Jack Daniels, communications director of MachinistsDistrict Lodge 751. ``But you can't get paid for it until you buildthem.''   A statement issued by Northwest in Minneapolis called the ordera ``testament to the new ownership's and new management'scommitment to the people of the Northwest and the growth of thecompany.''   Northwest ordered six Boeing 747-400s, the world's largestpassenger jet, and 40 757-200s, a shorter-range, highlyfuel-efficient twinjet, and took options on four 747-400s and 40757-200s.   The planes, scheduled for delivery from late 1993 through 1998,were ordered with Pratt andamp; Whitney PW2000 and PW4000 engines, makingthe deal worth $1.5 billion or more to the East Hartford, Conn.,manufacturer.   Chief corporate spokesman Harold Carr said the deal boostedBoeing's orders to 788 planes worth $42 billion this year, thefifth straight year of record orders, and the backlog of firmorders _ excluding options _ to 1,644 planes worth $82 billion withdeliveries extending into the late 1990s.   Those figures do not include an order announced Wednesday byCathay Pacific Airways Ltd. for two 747-400 freighters and optionson two more models for a total potential pricetag of about $600million because the deal was still being confirmed Thursday, Carrsaid.   Last Friday company officials announced an order by EvergreenAirways Corp. of Taiwan for four 747-400s and two extended-range767-300ERs and options for a like number of the same planes worthas much as $1.93 billion.   Production has been grinding to a halt at Boeing since the unionrepresenting about 57,800 workers, including 43,300 PugetSound-area members of District Lodge 751, went on strike Oct. 4.   The Machinists also represent about 12,000 workers in Wichita,Kan., 1,700 in Portland, Ore., and a few hundred in California,Utah, Montana, Hawaii and other states.   Four planes have been delivered since the strike began, andcompany officials said about three dozen more were close enough tocompletion for non-striking personnel to finish them.   Carr said senior Boeing officials had heard no concern fromcustomers about delivery problems. The Northwest order was thethird received by Boeing during the strike.   ``It's certainly not going to be an issue at the bargainingtable,'' Carr said.   Local union president Tom Baker said Boeing should start to feelthe heat soon.   ``I just don't know how they can withstand a prolonged workstoppage without facing a great deal of pressure,'' Baker said.``The company is not going to be able to deliver the existingaircraft, much less these (new orders), without us being back onthe job.''   Federal mediator Doug Hammond said Thursday he was remaining incontact with both sides, but no talks were scheduled.   There have been no negotiations since the Machinists voted 85percent to strike rather than accept a three-year offer featuringwage hikes of 4 percent, 3 percent and 3 percent, bonuses of 8percent of gross pay this year and 3 percent in 1990, acost-of-living clause to virtually match inflation, a reduction inmandatory overtime and increases in some benefits.</TEXT></DOC>
