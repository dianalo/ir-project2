We are distressed that this matter has escalated to thepoint of filing criminal charges. . . . It must simply be areflection of the times. . . . In insider-trading cases, yousue anything that walks.&quot;   -- Defense lawyer Otto Obermaier   What a difference a couple of years makes. A federalappeals court has vindicated Mr. Chestman, but only after hespent 11 months in Allenwood federal prison for a crime hedid not commit because it does not exist. Mr. Giuliani,defeated by the voters in the New York mayoral race, seemsdestined to be a defense lawyer. Mr. Obermaier is now theU.S. Attorney in Manhattan, appointed partly for hisexperience defending victims of abusive white-collarprosecutions.   The Second Circuit Court of Appeals decision in U.S. v.Chestman comes too late to temper the hyped prosecutions ofMichael Milken, Robert Freeman, Richard Wigton, TimothyTabor. Finally, though, the judges have declared that not allWall Street targets in the 1980s were obvious crooks, IvanBoeskys trading suitcases of cash for stolen insideinformation.   The court dealt with the technicalities of the securitieslaws, but the broad problem is clear: England has one, evenSwitzerland and Australia have them, but despite numerousprosecutions the U.S. still has no definition of insidertrading. Keeping the law vague does more than helpprosecutors puff up their allegations. This is part of abizarre but deliberate policy that people should not know howto follow the law and avoid transgressions that make themaccidental criminals.   &quot;I see no need to define insider trading further at thistime and give fertile legal minds opportunities to exploitloopholes,&quot; Rep. John Dingell said in a 1987 speech to theSecurities Industry Association. He was more definitive inhis 1988 SIA speech: &quot;There will be no definition of insidertrading.&quot; For some reason, the Michigan Democrat thinksmurderers deserve clearer laws than brokers.   So we have Mr. Chestman last week asking to be pinched asa reality test when he heard he'd finally been cleared. Heisn't talking publicly while prosecutors decide whether toappeal (U.S. Attorney Obermaier has recused himself), but onthe facts it's no wonder the judges ruled he'd been wronglyconvicted of insider trading, mail fraud and perjury:   Ira Waldbaum decided in 1986 to sell the family chain ofgrocery stores. He asked his elderly, frail sister to collecther stock certificates. When she asked one daughter to driveher to the bank, another daughter had to help out by pickingup the kids at school. She told her husband, Keith Loeb,about the reason for the car-pooling. The prosecutors and SECalleged that Mr. Loeb then called his broker at Gruntal andamp;Co., Mr. Chestman, to tell him he had some &quot;accurate,definite&quot; but undisclosed information about Waldbaum stock.   Mr. Chestman may well have bought Waldbaum stock on rumorsof the takeover by Aandamp;P before Mr. Loeb managed to get a callin to him. &quot;The theory put forth by the government thatstockbrokers always return calls by virtue of the nature oftheir business requires a presumption that we do not care toadopt in the context of a perjury charge,&quot; the court ruled,giving a flavor of the prosecutorial overreaching.   Even if Mr. Loeb passed inside information to Mr.Chestman, the court said there was no crime. Prosecutors saidMr. Chestman's Rule 10b-5 &quot;fraud&quot; was &quot;aiding and abetting&quot;Mr. Loeb to violate his fiduciary duty -- not to a companybut to his family -- to keep the takeover secret. Afourth-hand tippee convicted for this supposed crime is toomuch. Judge Roger Miner wrote that &quot;there simply is noevidence that he knew that Loeb was breaching a confidentialrelationship.&quot; Or indeed that Mr. Loeb had any duty to keepsecret what the court called &quot;family gossip.&quot;   Judge Daniel Mahoney went further. He said the SEC didn'thave the power as an agency to issue Rule 14e-3. This rulemade it a crime beginning in 1980 to &quot;be in possession ofmaterial information&quot; about a tender offer that the defendant&quot;knows or has reason to know is nonpublic&quot; and from aninsider. This knows-or-has-reason-to-know language has beenapplied to people who have no contractual or other legal dutyto keep information secret, such as those who overhear arumor on the golfcourse or in the elevator. Judge Mahoneyinvalidated Rule 14e-3 for creating a crime where &quot;there isno requirement that any fiduciary duty exist or be violated.&quot;   Why have so many prosecutors and regulators insisted onleaving insider trading undefined? One reason is that thisadvanced the agenda dating from the 1970s to have the courtsdo what Congress would never do by making it a crime simplyto know something in the market that someone else doesn'tknow. A favorite example of this equality-of-informationnotion is that if a passenger in a plane sees a big fire at afirm's main factory it should be a crime for him to sell thestock short.   Forced equality of information is an odd idea in anindustry with legions of analysts paid to ferret outinformation and where Moms and Pops pay mutual funds to watchmarkets for them. The law does not require a buyer to tellthe seller there might be oil under his land; why should atrader be jailed if he's the first to learn that a company isa fraud and sells the stock?   Indeed, the Supreme Court has twice defeated thisequal-information theory as unworkable and unwise. Now theChestman case puts in doubt what prosecutors call the&quot;misappropriation theory.&quot; This tries to create a legal dutyagainst using information that others don't have --equal-information by another name.   The narrow enforcement goal of prosecutors can sometimeslead them to forget the cost of overcriminalizing. Efficientmarkets require information, the faster the better. Vagueinsider-trading laws chill this information.   Congress can make an honest crime of insider trading bylegislating a definition. One already on the books would fitfine: theft. Mr. Boesky stole from clients despite hiscontract to keep their secrets. When lawyers or financialprinters break their duties to clients, they become thieves.Anyone who breaks a clear legal duty to keep newsconfidential should be liable to the owner of theinformation.   Conversely, if there's no legal duty to keep informationconfidential, there should be no crime. There is no reason toprosecute fourth-hand tippees or security analysts. Adefinition of insider trading as theft would convict thecriminal, protect the innocent and speed legitimateinformation to markets.</TEXT></DOC>
