Today, the euphoria is gone. Genentech is a victim of success -- real success, that is, as measured against a fantasy of success that had enthralled investors, Wall Street and Genentech itself.    The company is expected to sell nearly $180 million of TPA in its first year, which will make it the top first-year drug product in history. But in a startling case of mismanaged expectations, the company let Wall Street promote a vision of TPA sales more than twice that level -- sales that would send it almost halfway to its dream of being a $1 billion pharmaceutical giant in a mere 12 months.    Genentech officially broke the bad news two weeks ago. At meetings held on both coasts, Genentech President Kirk Raab, Chief Executive Officer Robert Swanson and Marketing Vice President James Gower said TPA sales have slowed unexpectedly. They added that third-quarter profit would be no better than a year earlier -- and a fraction of what some analysts had once anticipated.    Analysts who once touted the stock are unhappy. Some think that Genentech's 1988 profit will be flat or even below 1987's $42 million, or 50 cents a share. The stock has been sliding for months and recently hit a 52-week low; it closed yesterday at $16.75 a share, down 69% from its high for the year. Executives are contrite.    &quot;I flew to New York, and I said: 'I was wrong,'&quot; Mr. Gower says. &quot;I didn't know what to retreat to but honesty.&quot; He denies the overestimate came from his department, but only now has top management moved to quash it.    If Genentech can preserve its core strength -- gifted scientists -- against the threat of a brain drain, &quot;then there's long-term value&quot; for the patient investor who can acquire the stock at less than the current price, says Denise Gilbert, an analyst at Montgomery Securities.    But Genentech's top management clearly made two classic marketing errors: They misjudged the speed with which physicians would start using the blockbuster heart drug. And they misjudged the product's perceived advantage over a rival one costing less than one-tenth as much.    &quot;Things go in cycles,&quot; Mr. Swanson says. &quot;Sometimes you can't do anything wrong, and sometimes you can't do anything right.&quot; Adds a scientist whose stock options plunged: &quot;The transition from dreams to reality is a hard one. The TPA launch was badly handled in that it has made a big success look like something between a disappointment and failure.&quot;    Now, Genentech is shifting its marketing strategy and tightening its belt. But some analysts wonder how much profit it can squeeze out of TPA before a new generation of drugs starts competing with it.    Genentech launched TPA in the atmosphere of a crusade against unbelievers in the Food and Drug Administration and in medicine. Because a major study, announced in March 1985, indicated that TPA significantly outperformed its predecessor in dissolving deadly blood clots, top management adopted the view that it would be &quot;unethical&quot; not to use the drug to treat heart attacks. That credo was uncritically embraced by many Wall Street bulls, who went so far as to predict malpractice suits against doctors who failed to use TPA. At a price of $2,200 a dose -- more than 10 times that of Hoechst AG's rival streptokinase -- analysts began forecasting $400 million of TPA sales this year. No one discouraged them until now.    &quot;To say we oversold is unfair,&quot; Genentech President Raab says. But he concedes, &quot;We were optimistic as to how fast it would happen. And we undercalled the reluctance of physicians to use a revolutionary therapy.&quot;    In fact, Genentech played down the complexity of the medical marketplace, its cost strictures and its innate conservatism. Hospital pharmacies, under rigid cost controls, can't afford to give up streptokinase -- not yet anyway. Mr. Raab still insists that TPA's price isn't to blame, but the market's slow acceptance of the drug seems to render a different verdict. In addition, doctors hesitate to use a new product, especially one carrying a small but measurable risk of intracranial bleeding.    Another marketing problem: The numbers emerging so far from a welter of survival studies since the FDA approval show only a modest advantage for TPA -- not the huge advantage earlier predicted. In one major study, TPA reduced deaths 27% compared with a control group; in another test, streptokinase reduced deaths 21%. Last spring, the European Cooperative Study Group said TPA reduced in-hospital deaths 51% in the first two weeks after heart attack, against 47% for Beecham Group PLC's Eminase after 30 days.    Thus, the data seen by doctors have been &quot;confusing,&quot; acknowledges Mr. Gower, Genentech's marketing vice president. His marketing team has had a hard sell. The reports show that TPA indeed prolongs survival, but analysts say the numbers so far fail to prove enough superiority over the competition to warrant TPA's tenfold price premium.    Market confusion probably will reign until the first true head-to-head comparison of TPA and streptokinase in saving lives comes out. That study, an Italian trial dubbed Gissi 2, won't be finished until next June or July and may not be published until early 1990. By then, Eminase, the next serious contender for TPA's market share, may be on the U.S. market.    Genentech spent five years and $200 million to develop TPA. Recouping its investment is likely to take much of the two-year period during which analysts had figured the company would enjoy a head start. But Mr. Raab voices confidence. &quot;Eminase is the only product we see on the horizon. And it's a form of streptokinase,&quot; he says. &quot;We don't want to underestimate it, but we think TPA is superior.&quot;    Genentech's current share of the market for thrombolytic (clot-busting) drugs shows it to be a big fish in a disappointingly small pond. TPA now holds 65% of the market, streptokinase 35% and urokinase 5%, the company says. Most hospitals stock TPA. But out of 400,000 U.S. heart-attack patients medically eligible to receive such drugs, only 120,000 are getting TPA or any thrombolytic drug at all. Genentech says this reluctance is costing lives.    &quot;The market is flat and far from penetrated. . . . We can do better,&quot; says a chastened Mr. Swanson.    The reason thrombolytic therapy expanded slowly, says George Rathmann, the president of Amgen Inc., a biotech firm, is &quot;it was much too complex (a medical issue) to assume it was going to be zip-deedo.&quot; But he acknowledges: &quot;It's a heady thing when everybody loves your stock.&quot;    &quot;It's sad . . . but inevitable,&quot; says Robert Fildes, the president of Cetus Corp., a biotechnology company in Emeryville, Calif., which has never enjoyed Genentech's cachet with investors. &quot;A fine company with fine efforts was vastly, vastly overvalued, and now they're paying the price.&quot; But Mr. Fildes predicts Genentech eventually will rebound to $60 a share, much like the fall and rise of another glamour stock, Apple Computer Inc.    For now, that's cold comfort to Genentech's scientists and managers, who, along with other shareholders, invested heavily in the dream and now are paying for the reality. Most of Genentech's 1,760 employees heeded Mr. Raab's admonition that anyone who didn't buy company stock &quot;wasn't smart enough to work at Genentech.&quot; Many got in over their heads.    &quot;When the stock was leaping up, it was distracting. People were infatuated. People would ask, 'What's the price this hour?'&quot; says Mark Matteucci, a nucleic-acid chemist who recently left Genentech. Scientists, high on paper wealth, opened margin accounts at securities firms. &quot;Guys had parties at Schwab's,&quot; says a scientist in a reference to Charles Schwab andamp; Co., the discount brokerage house. &quot;They'd come in with cash or stock to cover their positions and avoid a margin call.&quot;    Another scientist confides: &quot;I sold my house and couldn't find another one right away. So I invested my house money in Genentech stock. I thought TPA was going to be a big drug.&quot; The stock plunge wiped out much of his equity.    In what now seems a case of awkward timing, moreover, Mr. Raab and five vice presidents unloaded tens of thousands of Genentech shares early last year when the stock was at $30 to $45 a share. Mr. Raab sold 42,000 shares, three-fourths of his holdings, to settle &quot;a personal financial obligation,&quot; he says.    Comments the scientist who invested his home equity in the stock: &quot;I'm real bitter about that. I'm left to sell my shares at $18 or $20, when they sold at $40.&quot;    Mr. Raab says: &quot;Nobody did it with insider information.&quot; He adds: &quot;All of us are terribly disappointed, but we all believe the stock will come back. I haven't sold any shares since March, and I look forward to a long career at Genentech.&quot; He still holds 13,188 shares, plus options.    Genentech has to do some belt-tightening to live within its leaner means. Research and development, projected to reach $140 million in 1988, is being cut about 15% to $120 million this year -- still three times what some biotech companies spend, Mr. Swanson notes. Next year, it will be flat.    Genentech also has imposed a hiring chill if not a freeze. With its payroll up to nearly 1,800, it now plans to hold the line and fill only key positions selectively.    All this means a tighter scientific focus, with the accent on product-driven research rather than basic science.    &quot;A lot of brilliant ideas don't lead to a product,&quot; Ralph Snyderman, the vice president for medical research and development, comments. &quot;We will be more selective. We will focus on those things with the scientific, clinical, regulatory and marketing advantages.&quot; This could portend more hard choices, such as the decision earlier this year to scale back Genentech's AIDS-vaccine development. The program was judged too lengthy, costly and uncertain.    Genentech's future hopes center on three products: Gamma interferon, an immuno-modulator, is being tested in lung cancer, colon cancer and malignant melanoma; it also seems to help children with the fatal immune disorder, chronic granulomatous disease. Genentech's CD4, a molecular sponge to soak up the AIDS virus, was the first of its competitors into the clinic and in early tests shows no toxic side effects. And heading for the clinic in early 1989 is Relaxin, a substance to aid in natural childbirth and stem the rising tide of Caesarean deliveries. Genentech still holds the strongest overall portfolio of drugs in the biotech pipeline.    But none of these are guaranteed to be the blockbuster that Genentech needs to fulfill Mr. Swanson's oft-repeated prophecy of topping $1 billion in revenue by the early 1990s. Most analysts now see this as a difficult promise to keep.    For now, Genentech is relying on its growth hormone, Protropin, and TPA. Mr. Gower, the marketing vice president, plans a major shift in tactics to reach the larger market pool of TPA's 400,000 potential U.S. patients. &quot;We'll stop fighting the comparative, competitive wars (with streptokinase),&quot; he says. &quot;We'll just start selling thrombolytics&quot; to win doctors over to clot-busting in general.    Genentech's 194 salesmen will be preaching: &quot;Forget brand names. For God's sake, just treat 'em,&quot; Mr. Gower says. This will work still better if the FDA permits Genentech to add improved survival to its marketing claim and label -- a blessing he confidently expects soon.    Having so far battled a trench war of muddy statistics, Mr. Gower predicts that the simple message &quot;Thrombolytics Save Lives&quot; is the best way to reach reluctant physicians and fulfill TPA's potential -- at least until the Gissi 2 study is out. And what if that study doesn't render a clear verdict for TPA over streptokinase?    &quot;It's not going to be worse,&quot; smiles Mr. Gower wearily, &quot;than it is right now.&quot;    ---                     Genentech Inc.
