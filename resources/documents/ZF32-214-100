 These include:andM;* Aggregation of lower speed communication and data lines into one or morebroadband backbone networks;andM;* High-speed local area network-wide area network (LAN-WAN) interconnectionsfor multiple LANs;andM;* Fiber distributed data interface/metropolitan area network (FDDI/MAN)internetworking;andM;* Digital imaging;andM;* Video networks;andM;* CAD/CAM networks.andM;This broadband networking, at 45M bits per second (bps) and up, brings terms,acronyms, protocols and standards that are either brand new or werepreviously in the province of phone companies and carriers.andP;  These include:andM;* T3, a serial telecommunication line;andM;* SONET (synchronous optical network), an emerging international standard foroptical transmission;andM;* Frame relay and cell relay, standards for packet formats in broadbandcommunication;andM;* HSSI (high-speed serial interface), an emerging international standard fordata communication.andM;T3, or DS-3 (digital signal level 3), broadband networking takes up where T1leaves off and is the next step in the telecom system's synchronous digitalhierarchy (SDH).andP;  Operating at 45M bps, T3 multiplexes 28 T1s (1.544M bps) toform a synchronous signal.andM;But T3 broadband networking has not been required by end-users for simpleinternetworking.andP;  The first customers for T3 broadband networking are heavycorporate users of T1 and attempting to consolidate them in the same way thatT1 consolidates multiple, lower speed networks.andP;  The break-even point betweenthe cost of a single T3 vs.andP;  multiple T1s can be as low as six T1s.andP;  But, asMark Luczak, manager of technical services at Inforton Systems Corp. notes,another factor in T3's appeal is applications.andM;&quot;The driving force behind the earlier move from 56K bps to T1 networking wasnot just cost.andP;  There was an application perfect for T1: integration of dataand voice on a T1 backbone,&quot; says he.andM;More applications will appear when broadband networking becomes readilyavailable.andP;  Some vendors report applications are already being implemented.andM;Optical-technology levelandM;Although the T3 products are just beginning to enter the market, SONET, thenext level of performance, is already being specified.andP;  SONET is ahigh-bandwidth optical standard that features its own optical carrierhierarchy, expressed in multiples of the basic OC1 rate of 51.84M bps.andP;  Thetop rate is OC-48, which is 2.488G bps.andP;  Because of design differencesbetween T3 and SONET, a T3 switch cannot function as a SONET switch, althougha SONET switch can function as a T3 switch.andM;Even though SONET-capable equipment is now being offered by a few vendors, itwill be at least three years before SONET is fully implemented.andP;  JeffreyWeiss, president of Cryptall Communications Corp., doesn't see many benefitsfor end-users at this time, because most don't require more than T3 broadbandnetworking.andM;&quot;SONET is a more flexible transport mechanism than other technologies, butthere isn't much need for its bandwidth yet.andP;  So SONET won't affectmainstream internetworking for a while,&quot; Weiss says.andM;Weiss believes that the first big SONET users will be the carriers, on theirown backbones and internal communication networks.andP;  The carriers will alsowant SONET in place to accommodate a nationwide fiber-optic system when itarrives.andP;  But some large corporations with their own private fiber-opticnetworks are looking at SONET for both its speed and future functionality.andM;Current and future standardsandM;A look at two SONET-based vendors shows what's going on.andP;  Timeplex Inc. andAdaptive Corp. are preparing for SONET with backbone equipment that eases thetransition from current standards to future standards.andP;  The TimeplexTX-3/Superhub switching matrix was engineered with carrier requirements andSONET migration in mind.andP;  It performs multiplexing, cross-connect anddrop-and-insert functions for up to 10 T3 lines or a mixture of T3s and T1sequivalent to 360 T1s, resulting in a supertransport backbone network.andM;The TX-3/Superhub is vendor-independent, conforming to the relevant DS-3standards.andP;  Timeplex's product marketing manager Frank Troccoli says, &quot;We cantransport a signal from any vendor's equipment, as long as it conforms to thestandards.&quot;andM;To control this traffic, Timeplex will bring out its element managementsystem (EMS), a PC-based, point-and-click graphical users interface (GUI).EMS is scheduled by 1992 to be integrated into a bigger family of programscalled Time/View 4000 that will run on Sun Microsystems Inc. workstations andencompass the TX-3/Superhub and all associated routers and concentrators.andM;Now the network, with its management system, becomes a series of managedpipes with all the new technologies (SONET, frame relay, HSSI) feeding intothe system.andM;&quot;Such a system requires a physical transport layer, which must be managed tokeep the pipes from getting too crowded.andP;  That's the function ofTX-3/Superhub: a managed physical transport layer backbone based on T3 todayand heading toward SONET tomorrow,&quot; says Troccoli.andM;Adaptive was founded to develop SONEt technology.andP;  Audrey MacLean, president,emphasizes the importance of conforming to current and future industrystandards.andP;  &quot;The standards process has accelerated,&quot; he says.andM;The Adaptive SONET Transmission Manager (STM) broadband network switch is&quot;SONET to the core.&quot;andP;  At its heart is a SONET switching matrix that cansimultaneously present different standard faces to the outside world.andO;Adaptive will be shipping T1, T3 and HSSI interfaces, with cell relaycurrently in development.andP;  The first STM, available by midyear, is the Model18 with a capacity of 18 T3s or 336 T1s.andM;MacLean also emphasizes the need for a intelligent network.andP;  It must:andM;* Assign levels of reliability;andM;* Signal link failures and move traffic around them;andM;* Partition bandwidth with a network management system;andM;* Communicate with facility with other network management systems by way of astandard interface.andM;&quot;Network management is something that you build in, not something that youadd on,&quot; says MacLean.andP;  The network should be intelligent enough to manageitself in real time in the presence of typical failures.andM;Routers and bridges are usually designed as LAN equipment and work their wayout to the WAN.andP;  T3 and SONET broadband networking have their conceptual anddesign origins at the carrier's backbone and work their way back into theLANs.andP;  So, from the LAN user's point of view, much of this hardware is ratherexotic because it deals with multiplexing schemes, switching matrices andaggregate signals management.andM;Cryptall and Teclo Systems Inc. have co-developed an Ethernet-to-WANbridge--the Telco 8023 Trestle--based on the Cryptall Series 3000 and Series4000 WAN bridges.andP;  These products differ only in their firmware.andP;  The 8023Trestle includes firmware that makes it compatible with Telco's networkmanagement system.andM;The 8023 Trestle bridges the appropriate LAN packets to a DS-2.andP;  They arethen fed to an M13, a standard that defines multiplexing of multiple T1s to aT3 (DS-3).andP;  DS-2 is a component of DS-3: four DS-1s make up a DS-2 and sevenDS-2s constitute a DS-3.andP;  The multiplexer, up to 2,000 feet from the bridge,combines the 8023 Trestle's output with DS-2s from other 8023 Trestles and/orT1s to provide a DS-3 for fiber or electrical transmission.andM;At other end of the network, a DS-2 is broken out of DS-3 and sent to another8023 Trestle and its LAN.andM;Applications for the 8023 Trestle include the transparent connection ofmultiple LANs across a WAN link or the integration of multiple LANs on afiber-optic backbone network.andP;  A DS-3 has sufficient bandwidth to carry thefull throughput of up to 12 Ethernet LANs (six pairs) across a single linkwith four T1s remaining for other traffic.andP;  This allows full integration ofvoice and data.andM;The development of HSSI by several vendors, including Adaptive Cisco SystemsInc. and IBM Corp., is a major LAN-side effort.andP;  Designed as a follow-on toV.35 and RS422 for speeds between 1.2M bps and 52, bps, HSSI aims at dataprocessors who prefer a datacommunication interface to a telecommunicationinterface.andP;  HSSI will provide a generalized and easily implemented port-sideinterface for connecting high-speed applications to a multiplexer and shouldfind its way into bridge and router products and telecom-oriented equipment.andM;The new generation of broadband networking provides more than a dedicatedpath from point A to point B.andP;  The back-to-back multiplexer-DCS (digitalcross-connect system) arrangements once required to combine and switchsignals can now be replaced by new products.andP;  These include NewbridgeNetworks Inc.'s MainStreet modular bandwidth managers for value-addedprocessing and Infotron's StreamLine 45 intelligent multiplexer, which dropsand inserts components of a T3 circuit and provides cross-connections.andM;These products, and others, combine intelligent signal processing withend-to-end path control via a sophisticated network management system.andM;Newbridge's MainStreet architecture is built around a multiplexing core towhich application-specific capabilities (e.g.andP;  fast packet and voicecompression) can be added and controlled by the network management system.andO;One kind of value-added processing available is frame relay adaptiveswitching and transport (FAST), an extension of the frame relay packetstandard.andM;Initially designed with integrated services digital network (ISDN) in mind,FAST assumes quiet digital transmission lines and intelligent devices.andP;  Itsformat can be simpler than X.25 so less processing overhead is required.andO;Multiplexing of packet data on a single aggregate line can take place atspeeds up to 2M bps rather than at the 64K-bps limitation of X.25.andM;Infotran's product uses the SYNTRAN standard, a multiplexing scheme fordealing with some of M13's limitations.andP;  Under SYNTRAN, a DS-O (a single64K-bps channel) can be broken out of a DS-3, whereas M13 stops at the DS-1level.andP;  Luczak points out that a SYNTRAN user is trading switchingflexibility for M13 compatibility.andP;  Migration to SONET will be about the samefor a SYNTRAN user or M13 user.andM;Manage the networkandM;The power of network management systems may prove as important to broadbandnetworking as raw bandwidth.andP;  Network management systems tend to behierarchical.andP;  Infotron's StreamLine 45 is managed by its PC-based ANM45software, while its GUI workstation-based integrated network manager (INM)handles networks of Infotron equipment.andP;  The MainStreet node-control packageis the PC-based Craft Interface, while the Sun-based NetworkStation overseesnetworks of Newbridge equipment.andM;Both high-level bandwidth managers feature GUIs that display such features asnetwork topologies, routing maps and statistics and allow for detailedcontrol of network behavior without arcane programming.andP;  Example: TheNewbridge NetworkStation permits point-and-click circuit routing byindicating end-points--the software uses a least-cost routing algorithm toset up the circuit.andP;  Not only can routes be easily established, but bandwidthcan be allocated to subnetworks, or used only as required.andM;Infotron's INM represents each device as an icon.andP;  Non-Infotron equipmentwith asynchronous communication can be accommodated by a foreign-deviceinterface that gives the foreign equipment its own window and native controlsystem on the INM screen.andM;The Newbridge approach to multivendor situations includes models of foreignequipment in the overall network model running on the workstation.andP;  It isthen possible to mix DCSes from different companies and still keep all thedynamic-multiplexing techniques for Newbridge products.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
