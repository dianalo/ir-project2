The government's civil complaints seek to recoup the money fromfour brokerage firms, including two of the nation's largest:Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and Prudential-Bache Securities.   The firms were accused of running up losses of at least $25.9million at two Sandamp;Ls in Colorado and Oklahoma that are now insolvent.   The government on Wednesday accused the brokerage firms of usingfunds from the Sandamp;Ls to purchase highly speculative futures andoptions contracts.   The complaints involve the now-defunct Key Savings and LoanAssociation of Englewood, Colo., and the former Universal Savingsand Loan Association of Chickasha, Okla. The two institutions weredeclared insolvent and taken over by the government in February1987.   The complaints, brought by the Federal Savings and LoanInsurance Corp., also named as defendants five commodity programsalesmen, who either now work or once worked for the firms.   FSLIC, which insures Sandamp;L deposits up to $100,000, has the taskof trying to recoup costs incurred when an Sandamp;L fails.   Federal officials have estimated that one in four Sandamp;L failuresis the direct result of fraud, but critics have charged thatregulators have been slow to prosecute these cases.   President Bush, in announcing his Sandamp;L bailout plan in February,promised to step up efforts to recover at least a portion of thebillions of dollars that were embezzled or lost at failed Sandamp;Ls.   The Senate approved its version of the Sandamp;L bailout package onWednesday, a measure that provides $157 billion over the next twodecades, with two-thirds of that coming from taxpayers.   The FSLIC actions, filed over the past three weeks in federalcourts in Denver and Oklahoma City and before the Commodity FuturesTrading Commission, were not announced until Wednesday.   Shearson-Lehman was accused of involving Key Savings in acomputer-driven trading system in 1985 and 1986 on futures andoptions in violation of federal regulations governing the soundnessof Sandamp;L investments.   The complaint also named as defendants Shearson salesman DouglasJ. Shaw and former Shearson salesmen Earl Pettet and Arthur DonaldRobb Jr. The complaint, which was filed before the CommodityFutures Trading Commission, seeks at least $9.7 million in damages,including the return of $1.1 million in commissions.   FSLIC also filed a $7.4 million suit in U.S. District Court inDenver against Francis ``Bud'' Hildenbrand, who allegedly took overa portion of Key's trading account in November 1985 after theinstitution terminated its relationship with Pettet.   A third complaint, filed against Prudential Bache and Robb,alleges that Prudential-Bache shared Key's trading account withShearson Lehman after Robb left Shearson to join Prudential-Bache.That complaint, filed with the CFTC, seeks at least $2.8 million indamages.   Peter Costiglio, a spokesman for Prudential-Bache in New York,said the brokerage firm would vigorously fight the charges.   ``The firm contends that it did not act improperly and thetrading done in the account was done with the full knowledge andinstructions of the savings and loan,'' he said.   FSLIC also filed suit in federal court in Oklahoma City seekingat least $15 million in damages against two other brokerage firms,Geldermann Inc. of Chicago and UMIC Inc. of Memphis, along withUMIC sales representative Charles Alex Denny.   The Oklahoma City suit alleges that futures and options tradingdone by the brokerage firms resulted in more than $6 million inlosses at Universal Savings.   The civil suit also named as defendants three former executivesconnected with Universal Savings, Arthur A. Wallace, the presidentof Universal; Gregg Crosby, vice president of Universal FuturesInc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Sandamp;L; and Bryan Green, formervice president of the Sandamp;L.   Officials from the other brokerage firms did not returntelephone calls asking for comment.</TEXT></DOC>
