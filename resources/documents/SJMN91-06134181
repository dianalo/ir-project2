Lundbergis editor in chief of all of AMA's publications.;    Blacks and Hispanics havehigher rates of unemployment than whites, and more often have low-level jobs.So they have less employment-related health insurance and are less likely toreceive medical care, Lundberg said.;    And the public sector has not filledthe gaps, he said, noting that Medicaid coverage is often harder to get instates that have large populations of blacks.;    Nationwide, an estimated 31million to 37 million Americans don't have any health insurance, and millionsof others who are insured lack adequate coverage.;    &quot;An aura ofinevitability is upon us,&quot; Lundberg said in his editorial. &quot;It is no longeracceptable morally, ethically or economically for so many of our people to bemedically uninsured or seriously underinsured.&quot;;    The AMA devoted the entireissue of its journal this week to the need to reform the nation's health caresystem. From among 80 individuals and groups that answered the AMA's call lastyear for health-care reform proposals, journal editors selected 13 forpublication. Also, 52 articles on the topic were published in the AMA's ninespecialty journals.;    The 13 selections represent a broad range ofproposals, from the far left of the political spectrum to the far right. Theyrepresent the views of academia, labor, consumers and government, as well asthe AMA. Most of the proposals have been around for some time.;    Amongthem:;    (check) The AMA proposes to expand access to all by requiringemployers to provide health insurance for all full-time workers and theirfamilies. Government would help employers with tax breaks. All states wouldhave risk pools for the medically uninsurable and others who can't getinsurance.;    (check) Sen. John D. Rockefeller, D-W.Va., said he willintroduce legislation that would require employers to provide workers andtheir families with insurance, replace Medicaid with a program that wouldcover all those without job-based insurance and workers whose employers payinto the program.;    (check) The National Organization of Physicians WhoCare, based in San Antonio, Texas, also proposes to require employers to coverworkers, but to make the cost affordable, policies would provide only basiccoverage and would have high deductibles, perhaps $1,000. People wouldestablish special medical savings accounts with pre-tax dollars for uncoveredmedical expenses.;    (check) The Kansas Employer Coalition on Health Inc. inTopeka proposes to require employers to provide health insurance for workersor pay a tax to support a public plan. It also proposes that the states or thefederal government set a maximum annual percentage increase for all healthinsurance premiums.;    (check) Stuart Butler of the Heritage Foundationwrites that the nation's large number of uninsured is due mainly to taxtreatment of health care. He would correct inequities in tax assistance with asystem of refundable tax credits for health expenses and put the onus ofbuying health insurance on families.;    (check) Physicians for a NationalHealth Program propose a single, comprehensive public insurance programwithout co-payments or deductibles. It would allow everyone to choose his orher own provider and would be financed with earmarked health-care taxes.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910513  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  679  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday May 13, 199100134181,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
