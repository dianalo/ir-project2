 Premier Bill Vander Zalm pushed a button in Vancouver to make the lastconnection in the Telecom Canada 7,000-kilometre fibre lightguide network.andM;&quot;As amazed as our grandfathers must have been to visualize their voices beingcarried over copper wires strung on poles, so we have reason today to be awedat the knowledge that our voices are now carried from coast to coast asbursts of light, on a thin filament of glass,&quot; Bryan Rawlings, director ofnetwork operations at Telecom Canada, told an audience at The Chateau LaurierHotel.andM;With a flash of light, two hair-thin strands were fused together to form acontinuous band of lightguide fibre from Vancouver to Halifax.andM;At the moment fusion was complete, Ottawa, Halifax and Vancouver wereconnected in a video conference via the network.andM;Inaugurating the network, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney conversed with VanderZalm in Vancouver and with Nova Scotia Minister of Transport andCommunications, George Moody in Halifax.andM;&quot;The members of Telecom Canada are to be congratulated,&quot; said Mulroney in abrief speech, &quot;for the foresight, the leadership and the sensitivity tonational interests which are reflected in the decision you took to developthis outstanding addition to Canada's telecommunications infrastructure.&quot;andM;The Telecom Canada fibre lightguide transmission system is the first, thelongest and the only telecommunications network in Canada capable of offeringvoice, data and video service through fibre optics from coast to coast.andM;Fibre optics, also known as lightguide transmission systems, are unmatched interms of capacity, reliability, quality and security, said Rawlings.andM;Telecom president John Farrell said the network, completed over a period offive years at a cost of nearly $500 million, assures Canadians superiortelecommunications services well into the 21st century.andM;&quot;By 1993 the fibre optic network will be linked to Newfoundland and P.E.I.andO;where engineering work is now underway,&quot; he added.andM;With a transmission speed of 565 Mbps and a total capacity of 24,192 voicecircuits, a single fibre pair of the trans-Canada network could carry half ofTelecom Canada's current digital terrestrial traffic.andM;Rawlings explained that prior to the existence of fibre optic transmissionsystems, glass fibre had to be manufactured to such a purity that &quot;if it wereas thick as the ocean, you could see clearly to the bottom.andM;&quot;The fibre had to be durable and capable of being manipulated in the samemanner as copper telephone cables.&quot;andM;On Telecom Canada's lightguide system, the repeaters used to amplify andregenerate the signal are spaced about 35 km apart along most of the system.andM;The cable crosses 60 rivers from coast to coast and a variety of methods wereemployed to place the cable in these areas, said Rawlings.andP;  These methodsincluded: drilling from one side, drilling from both sides, dredging andcovering or placing the cable in conduits across existing bridges.andM;Minimize impactandM;Rawlings said great care was taken to minimize any impact on the environment.andO;In fact, B.C.andP;  Telephone won two environmental awards for the care they tookin placing the cable across rivers without disturbing the salmon spawninggrounds.andM;Rawlings said one of the major geographical obstacles encountered wheninstalling the network were across the Canadian Shield.andM;&quot;The route had to be built in rock because the decision made at the beginningwas that the entire route would be buried without exception.andM;&quot;So across the Canadian Shield where you have rock, the decision was made toblast, or in some cases to use an intense heating arrangement to break openrock, and put the cable through it.&quot;andM;Eventually, almost all of Telecom Canada telecommunications will be carriedon fibre optic transmission systems.andM;&quot;In many parts of the country, work on a second route is already underway,&quot;said Rawlings.andP;  &quot;When this second route is finished, it'll be possible totransfer circuits from one route to the other in a very short time should acable break or some other failure occur.&quot;andM;In the meantime, the lightguide system is protected by standby protectionfacilities on the microwave radio routes and by standby facilities, leasedfrom Telesat Canada, on the Anik C3 satellite.andM;Rawlings predicts fibre optic connections to the home will become moreprevalent in the future to replace the copper cable now used to bringtelephone service in.andP;  &quot;And for that matter,&quot; he adds, &quot;to replace thecoaxial cables that are used to bring cable television in.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
