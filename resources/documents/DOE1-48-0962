<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-48-0962 </DOCNO><TEXT>For a relativistic irreducible quantum field theory (QFT) in which thebosons and fermions fulfill the canonical commutation relation (CCR)and the canonical anticommutation relation (CAR), respectively, it isshown that in nandgt;3 space dimensions Bose and Fermi fields fulfill freefield equations. Furthermore which interactions might be compatible withCCR and CAR in lower space dimensions are characterized. The possiblecandidates are interactions of type Q{sub 2}(psi,psi/sup dagger/)phi+P{sub4}(phi) in n = 3, Q{sub 2}(psi,psi/sup dagger/)P{sub 2}(phi)+P{sub 6}(phi)in n = 2, and Q{sub 4}(psi,psi/sup dagger/)F(phi) in n = 1 space dimensions,where Q/sub m/ and P/sub m/ are polynomials of degree up to m.</TEXT></DOC>
