Their proposal differs from the plan unsuccessfully pursued bySecretary of State George P. Shultz in that it would bypass Jordan,which controlled the West Bank for l9 years, and strongly implies _but does not specifically recommend _ creation of a Palestinianstate.   McGovern, the losing Democratic standard bearer in 1972, wasexplicit in an interview, however, that Israel should deal with thePalestine Liberation Organization with the purpose of establishinga Palestinian state on the West Bank.   Beside McGovern and Goldwater, who was the losing Republicanpresidential candidate in 1964, those endorsing the proposal wereformer Undersecretary of State George W. Ball, former World JewishCongress President Philip W. Klutznick, and three former Europeangovernment heads _ Garrett Fitzgerald of Ireland, Anker Jorgensenof Denmark and Bruno Kreisky of Austria.   ``We support the continued independence and security of thestate of Israel,'' the statement said. ``We equally affirm theright of self-determination and security for the Palestinianpeople. We believe that mutual recognition and good-faithnegotiations between Israelis and Palestinians can achieve a justsettlement...''   Israel would yield all of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip,which it has held since 1967, to form a homeland for thePalestinians in return for the Arab world's acceptance.   The negotiations, the statement said, should be ``based onmutual recognition of national legitimacy and the exchange ofterritory for peace. The bloody violence and loss of life in thedisputed territory underscores the urgency of constructivenegotiations.''   Shultz returned last week from the Middle East where he wasunable to persuade Israel and Jordan to enter negotiations.Jordan's King Hussein demanded assurances that Israel would yieldthe West Bank, which Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir refusedto provide.   In ruling out PLO participation, Shultz said Yasser Arafat'sorganization, which has carried out a number of terrorist assaultson Israelis and Americans, must recognize Israel's right to existfirst. His plan called for including Palestinians in a jointdelegation with Jordan.   Asked about bypassing Jordan, McGovern said ``I think we've gotto get around it. The government of Israel has to negotiate withthe PLO. The PLO has said it's willing to be part of an all-Arabdelegation. That would be fine with me. It's a matter of thePalestinians determining who is to speak for them.''   McGovern said the PLO was the only organization capable ofspeaking for Arab Palestinians and the only one ``that couldenforce what's agreed on.''</TEXT></DOC>
