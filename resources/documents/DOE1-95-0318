The IAEA is actively involved in promotingtraining in radiological protection, and this report has been preparedto provide the guidance that may be required in this development. Theoriginal version of the report on this subject was published in 1964as Technical Reports Series No. 31 entitled ''Training in RadiologicalProtection: Curricula and Programming''. In 1975 a second version waspublished entitled ''Training in Radiological Protection for NuclearProgrammes'' as Technical Reports Series No. 166. This publication isintended mainly for use by persons who are responsible for organizingtraining programmes in radiation protection. It also reflects the policyof the Agency to have continuing standardized training in radiation protection.In addition to a small change in the title of the report, some conceptsand ideas which are no longer applicable have been omitted and new informationincluded. An important part of this report is the list of courses nowoffered in many Member States.</TEXT></DOC>
