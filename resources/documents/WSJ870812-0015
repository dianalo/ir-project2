Had2nd-Quarter Net LossTotaling $2.7 Million</HL><DD> 08/12/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> NOVCEARNINGS (ERN) </IN><DATELINE> SAN DIEGO  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Northview Corp., a hotel concern formerly headed by arbitrager Ivan F. Boesky, posted a second-quarter net loss of $2.7 million, partially because of the &quot;absence of income from arbitrage-related investment activities.&quot;    The net loss included a $1.1 million tax credit. In the year-earlier quarter, Northview had net income of $3.4 million, or $1.23 a share. Revenue for the latest second quarter increased 3.4% to $10.6 million from $10.3 million.    Northview said it had a $1.9 million loss from investment activities in the latest second quarter, compared with $8.3 million profit a year earlier. The company noted that year-earlier second-quarter results were restated to reflect a change in the treatment of gains on securities transactions. That change decreased net income for the 1986 second quarter $989,000, with a comparable increase in the fourth quarter of 1986, a company spokesman said.    As reported, Mr. Boesky resigned as chairman and chief executive officer of Northview last November following his settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission of insider-trading charges. In December, Northview appointed Robert M. Loeffler, a former trustee of Equity Funding Corp. of America, to the top posts.    Northview had a 2.8% increase in second-quarter pretax profit from its ongoing hotel activities, to $2,027,000 from $1,972,000. But Northview said that losses associated with the opening of a hotel also contributed to the second-quarter net loss.    For the six months, Northview had a net loss of $3.4 million, after a $1.5 million tax credit, on revenue of $19.8 million, compared with net of $4.5 million, or $1.65 a share, on revenue of $20 million a year earlier. </TEXT></DOC>
