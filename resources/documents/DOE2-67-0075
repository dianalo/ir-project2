<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-67-0075 </DOCNO><TEXT>Induction Heating has grown over the past fifty years to where it is usedtoday in many metalworking industrial applications. These range frommass heating processes; such as for forming, forging, rolling, and extrusionof metals; to all types of heat treatment applications, such as hardening,annealing, and stress-relieving operations. It also provides selectiveheating for metals joining operations; such as welding, brazing and soldering;as well as specialty heating for curing of coatings, bonding, vesseland susceptor heating, and various fiber optics and semiconductor processingoperations. While conventional fossil furnaces usually involve lowercapitol equipment costs, induction can often be justified by one or moreof the following benefits that it provides: 1. Greater heating conversionefficiencies, lower energy costs; 2. Quality improvements in the endproduct; and 3. Higher levels of productivity yielding lower productioncosts. Recent advancements in technology such as solid state power sources,heirarchical controls, and robotics have provided opportunities for expandedapplications of induction heating.</TEXT></DOC>
