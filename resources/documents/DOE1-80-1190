Top priority in chemical measurement shouldbe to improve understanding of atmospheric distribution of trace gases(CO/sub 2/, O/sub 3/, CH/sub 4/, N/sub 2/O and chlorofluorocarbons) thatdetermine the tropospheric infrared radiation budget. Equally importantis to measure trace gases (CO, NO/sub x/ and individual hydrocarbons)that indirectly determine the abundance of tropospheric ozone. Light-absorbingaerosols should be measured insofar as changes in their abundance arebelieved to contribute to climatic change. Ice core and snow pack samplesrecord changes in abundance of species involved in control of climate,and the history of emissions and deposition of sulphur compounds, NO/subx/ and trace metals, which is of value in understanding how atmosphericcomposition has developed. If environmental effects of air pollutionwithin the Arctic require control strategies to be considered, arcticairmasses can be tracked back to their origins from the distributionof trace metals in aerosols, and through measurement of trace gases whichoriginate only from known specific sources.</TEXT></DOC>
