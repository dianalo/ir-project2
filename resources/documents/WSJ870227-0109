A sub-cabinet task force recommended that the U.S. impose new trade sanctions as early as April 1 if Japanese microchip makers are found to be violating the accord. The group has begun assembling data on recent U.S.-Japanese semiconductor transactions for presentation to the cabinet-level Economic Policy Council in mid-March. U.S. officials say if the council decides to order new sanctions, the restrictions could take effect two weeks later.    Administration policy makers said the most likely retaliatory action would be for the U.S. to impose punitive tariffs on Japanese products that use semiconductors -- such as laser printers -- rather than to try to limit imports of microchips themselves. Imposing duties on semiconductor imports directly would hurt U.S. corporations that use microchips in the products they make, U.S. strategists said.    Washington complains that Japanese chip makers haven't stopped predatory pricing in third-country markets -- even though they pledged to do so in the July 31 accord. Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry pledged to help the U.S. guard against Japanese &quot;dumping&quot; -- selling below fair market value or cost of production -- outside the U.S., but so far it has been unsuccessful.    U.S. officials also charge that Japan hasn't kept its promise to allow U.S. chip makers a much larger share of the semiconductor market in Japan. They say the cabinet council meeting next month also may consider additional, still-unspecified measures designed to prod Japanese electronics manufacturers into buying more U.S.-made chips.    Tokyo promised to increase the U.S. share of the Japanese semiconductor market to &quot;more than 20%&quot; by 1991 from 8.2% now. But so far, U.S. sales in Japan have risen only marginally.    The administration has been under increasing pressure from the Semiconductor Industry Association, the U.S. industry's trade group, to impose sanctions against Japan so as to spur Tokyo into trying harder to enforce the pact. U.S. officials warned Japan in late January that Washington would retaliate if the violations weren't sharply reduced.    Meanwhile, Japan agreed to complete talks by next August on getting Japanese auto makers to buy more U.S.-made car parts. Negotiators will aim for an accord that would provide for &quot;significant&quot; increases in such purchases. The pact also will strive to make it easier for U.S. concerns to develop long-term relationships with Japanese car manufacturers. </TEXT></DOC>
