The percentage of residential customers who reported they weresatisfied with their phone service climbed from about 93.1 percentto about 94.1 percent from 1985 to June 1988, the FederalCommunications Commission concluded.   Small business user satisfaction increased from about 91.6percent in 1985 to near 94.2 percent in the first half of 1988, themost recent period for which figures are available, the FCC said.   Large business user satisfaction climbed from about 90.3 percentin 1985 to 94.7 percent in mid-1988, the commission said.   ``Residence customer perceptions have not changed significantlysince 1985, while business perceptions have noticeably improved,''it said.   The FCC study, released last week, was based upon semiannualreports the commission has required the seven ``Baby Bell''companies to file in the wake of the 1984 ATandamp;T divestiture.   The Bell company reports were broken down into five broadcategories for analysis: customer satisfaction, dial tone delay,transmission quality, on time service orders, and equipment failureand blocking.   ``In the areas of customer perception, transmission quality anddial tone speed, the companies generally improved since 1985. ...The companies do show some decline with respect to on time service... performance for residential customers,'' the report said.   The percentage of customers satisfied with dial tone speed (aconnection within three seconds) rose from about 97.6 percent in1985 to nearly 98.9 percent in 1988. Transmission qualitysatisfaction climbed from about 89.9 percent to 94.5 percent.   However, on time service order satisfaction for residential usersfell from 98.1 percent in 1985 to 97 percent in June 1988, thereport said.   The report covered the local phone companies operated by U.S.West, Southwest Bell, BellSouth, NYNEX, Pacific Telesis, BellAtlantic and Ameritech.   The commission cautioned that data collected from state publicutilities commissions may be more detailed and that the data shouldnot be used to compare companies.   ``The individual reports provided by the companies tend toobscure trends since the indices almost always register over 90percent,'' the commission said.</TEXT></DOC>
