People started returningTuesday after three straight nights passed without missiles hitting.;    Butthe exodus began anew Wednesday after Tuesday night's attack, in which anIraqi Scud warhead landed on an apartment building in greater Tel Aviv.;   One family in that building had returned to Tel Aviv only that morning afterfleeing the city for five days in Beersheva, gateway to the Negev Desert.Miraculously, the Halachmi family survived the strike, with three of 10members suffering minor injuries.;    The movement of people out of Tel Avivhas been so extensive, in fact, that one political scientist, SamLehman-Wilzig of Bar-Ilan University in Tel Aviv, has even suggested thatIraqi President Saddam Hussein may achieve with his Scuds what DavidBen-Gurion never could through political means: The dispersal of Israel'spopulation.;    Lehman-Wilzig wrote Tuesday in the Jerusalem Post that &quot;themilitary handwriting is now clearly on the wall for all to see -- includingother hostile Arab nations.&quot;;    &quot;Ballistic attack has the best chance ofachieving the heretofore impossible task of bringing the conflict to Israel'smost populated centers,&quot; he wrote.;    &quot;Once the full realization sets in . .. that this is going to be a much longer-term general problem, it is notinconceivable that many more Israelis will make a more significant investmentin their future -- permanent life in outlying areas.&quot;;    Ironically, Tel Avivand Jerusalem have traded places during the past week, a point noted Wednesdayby Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek at a news conference in Tel Aviv, where he hadcome to tour the sites of recent missile strikes.;    In December, after aseries of stabbings by Palestinians in Jerusalem, some Jerusalem residentsheaded for hotels in Tel Aviv on the Mediterranean until things calmed down athome.;    Now the tables have turned.;    Normally, occupancy rates inJerusalem are about 45 percent in January, according to Jean-Paul Herzog,general manager of the Jerusalem Hilton. This week, he said, &quot;I thinkbasically all of Jerusalem is full.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  VERNON LOEB, Knight-Ridder News Service  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Tel Aviv, Israel  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910124  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  10A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  582  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday January 24, 199100024302,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
