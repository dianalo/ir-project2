Nagging concerns over personal security, widespread anti-Americansentiment and the career risk of having to defend highlycontroversial U.S. policies plague U.S. officials assigned in theregion, particularly in Panama, El Salvador and Nicaragua.   As an example of the potential risk to career advancement, Sen.Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., an outspoken critic of administrationpolicy in the region, recently blocked the promotion of two foreignservice officers stationed there.   A country-by-country rundown of the difficulties facing U.S.personnel:   Panama _ In October, U.S. Marine sentries at Howard Air ForceBase exchanged gunfire on four occasions with unidentifiedintruders. Between February and October, there were 240 reportedcases of harassment of American servicemen in Panama, according tothe U.S. Southern Command.   In September, the administration decided to reduce the U.S.diplomatic presence because of what one official called a``potentially confrontational situation'' linked to continuedU.S.-Panamanian hostility.   The administration's decision not to have dealings with Panama'smilitary-dominated government has produced a variety of problems forU.S. diplomats. Some are forced to drive with expired licensesbecause the government won't renew them, while others rent carsrather than risk driving with expired plates.   El Salvador _ Concern over personal security has heightened withstepped up leftist rebel activity in San Salvador, the capital. Inlate October, the offices of the U.S. Agency for InternationalDevelopment were struck by a projectile that cracked several windowsand caused minor damage.   In previous years, the U.S. Embassy has been the target of rebelattacks on several occasions but without serious incident. Diplomatsposted in El Salvador long have been security conscious, nevertaking the same route twice in a row when commuting. To avoiddetection, one diplomat had his car repainted every few weeks.   Nicaragua _ In July, U.S. Ambassador Richard Melton and sevenother members of the embassy staff were expelled by the Sandinistagovernment on grounds of interfering in Nicaragua's internal affairs.   Nicaragua has refused to allow the State Department to sendreplacement envoys to Managua, placing an unusually heavy work loadon the remaining skeleton staff. Their mission is complicated by anatmosphere of almost complete mistrust between the two governments.   Several State Department officials said the biggest concern ofU.S. diplomats posted in the region is not personal security but thepossibility that their association with President Reagan's policiescould damage their careers.   Dodd recently blocked the promotions of Everett Briggs, U.S.ambassador to Honduras, and David Dlouhy, who is stationed in ElSalvador and spent a brief period as head of the embassy.   Dodd complained that the two envoys impeded congressionalattempts to exercise oversight of U.S. policy. His actionunderscored the continuing animosity between the administration andDemocratic liberals over Central America.   Dlouhy accused Dodd of ``McCarthyite tactics that would send achilling message to the Foreign Service.''   Said Perry Shankle, president of the American Foreign ServiceAssociation, the union of career diplomats: ``As a career officeryou do put your career on the line in these highly chargedsituations. There are a lot of dangers involved.''   Despite the risks, there is no shortage of career diplomatswilling to serve in Central America, State Department officials say.One reason is that service in that region is a quick route to``in-house'' promotions, the officials say, noting thatcongressional approval is required only for promotions involving thehighest ranking officials.   Still, Central America has been a career-threatening area forsome time. When the Reagan administration assumed office eight yearsago, numerous officials who had a hand in implementing PresidentCarter's policy in Central America were either fired or sent tolow-priority areas as punishment for perceived misjudgments.   The most dramatic example was Carter's last assistant secretaryfor Latin America, William Bowdler, who shortly before Reagan'sfirst inaugural was summarily evicted from his office. Shattered bythe experience, he soon left the Foreign Service and has lived invirtual seclusion with his wife in southern Virginia ever since.</TEXT></DOC>
