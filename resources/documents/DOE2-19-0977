The action of both treatments was usually additive regardlessof the sequence of application. However, in human lymphocytes irradiatedat low temperature, the photosensitization interacted synergisticallywith the subsequent ionizing radiation; in this experiment the initialphotosensitization reduced the yield of micronuclei produced by gamma-radiation.</TEXT></DOC>
