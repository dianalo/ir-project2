Meanwhile, stocks surged to another record high today.   The dollar finished the week at 122.40 yen, up 0.88 yen from its121.52-yen Thursday closing. It opened the day at 122.15 yen andtraded between 122.07 and 122.60 yen during the day.   ``Coordinated overnight intervention by central banks around theworld helped push the dollar up,'' said King Ogino, a dealer atGoldman Sachs. He said continued dollar buying by the Bank of Japantoday also served to bolster the U.S. currency.   The dollar has lost 3.48 yen in Tokyo since the start ofNovember, and on Thursday dipped to 121.52 yen, its lowest closingsince modern exchange rates were set in the late 1940s.   The Bank of Japan intervention came after Finance Minister KiichiMiyazawa said the central bank and other major currency countrieswere poised to intervene in the market should the U.S. currencycontinue its nose dive.   Ogino said the dollar also was buoyed by unconfirmed rumors fromNew York of an agreement at an alleged secret meeting Nov. 14 amonghigh-ranking monetary authorities that the dollar should tradebetween 120 and 140 yen.   ``The report is unconfirmed but it had good timing'' to bolsterthe dollar, he said.   But he said the dollar was likely to take another beating againstthe yen next week ``as speculators may test new lows for thecurrency.''   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Averagerose 103.39 points or 0.36 percent to 29,180.20. The closing levelwas the sixth straight record high for the index.   Dealers attributed the strong performance to confidence inJapan's economy. Today's rally was led mainly by large capitalissues, especially steels, they said.   ``But the Nikkei won't break the 30,000-point too soon,'' onedealer said, speaking on condition of anonymity.</TEXT></DOC>
