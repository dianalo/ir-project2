Currey, head of an investment group that agreed to buy Greyhound Lines Inc., said he reached an agreement on a three-year labor contract with leaders of the bus line's union.    The contract proposal will now go for ratification to Greyhound Lines' 6,500 employees, who are represented by the Amalgamated Transit Union. Mr. Currey said that 20 of the 23 local union presidents of the ATU voted to recommend ratification.    According to a joint statement released by the union and Mr. Currey, the proposed contract provides for job security for employees with at least five years of seniority, an incentive plan, premium pay for drivers in eight large cities, continuation of pension benefits and changes in work rules.    Mr. Currey called the discussions that led to the agreement &quot;a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to begin with a clean sheet of paper.&quot; Domenic Sirignano, president of the ATU's Greyhound Council, said the council will issue a &quot;strong&quot; recommendation for ratification of the proposal.    The investment group led by Mr. Currey, who is chairman of BusLease Inc., based here, agreed to buy the bus line from Phoenix, Ariz.-based Greyhound Corp. for $350 million in cash and securities. The sale is expected to close March 19. </TEXT></DOC>
