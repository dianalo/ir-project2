It was the first remark by a senior Kuwaiti official that thegovernment had decided against purchasing the French warplanes.   Both the emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, and DefenseMinister Sheik Nawaf al-Ahmed al-Sabah said last month that Kuwaithad not yet decided whether to buy the sophisticated planes.   Maj. Gen. Jaber Khaled al-Sabah, deputy chief of staff of thearmed forces, told the daily Al-Anbaa that a deal with the UnitedStates for 40 F-18 warplanes is enough to fulfill Kuwait's needsfor the time being.   ``Kuwait considers the F-18 warplane suitable for its airforce,'' he said. ``But this does not mean that other planes areinferior to it. The Kuwaiti air force is not in need of more arms.''   The $1.8 billion deal for the F-18s was concluded during a visitto the United States last year by Crown Prince and Prime MinisterSheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah. Delivery starts in 1994.</TEXT></DOC>
