President John F. Kennedy had prodded him to apply for the spaceprogram, says Edward J. Dwight Jr., and there were rumors that ``hehad this dream of having a black or ... an Oriental'' on thenation's first mission to the moon.   Dwight never became an astronaut. The reason, he says _ hisbitterness muted but still there _ was racial prejudice,particularly by a white senior officer at the Air Force test pilotschool to which Dwight had been assigned.   You'll wish that this otherwise excellent ``Orbit'' had donemore in the segment _ had identified the officer Dwight doesn'tname and listened to his side of the story.   It might have shown that even with Dwight's accusations ofbigotry, perhaps a bit more was involved. The program, produced byfilmmaker William Miles, should at least have raised more questions.   But this one-hour documentary about America's black astronautsand the blacks who worked behind the scenes in the nation's spaceprogram, still is well worth viewing.   It lets them tell of their dreams and the obstacles they facedand amply shows their determination to succeed in what for yearshad been an all-white, all-male preserve.   The program profiles six black astronauts, including the lateDr. Ronald E. McNair, one of the Challenger crew members killedwhen the spacecraft exploded in January 1986.   Others on the program include Dr. Mae C. Jemison, who will makeher first space flight next year, and Air Force Col. Guinon S.Bluford, who in 1983 became the first black to travel in space.   ``Orbit'' also shows, sparingly, the outright racism thatexisted, the ugliest example a letter once sent the widow of AirForce Maj. Robert H. Lawrence Jr., the first black pilot selectedfor astronaut duty.   Sympathy cards poured in, she says, after he was killed in themid-'60s when the ejection seat of his F-104 fighter malfunctionedjust before the plane crashed.   But the mail also brought hate. One writer, she recalls, said hewas glad her husband was killed ``because now there would be nocoons on the moon.''   In a long but interesting segment, actress Nichelle Nichols, Lt.Uhura of ``Star Trek,'' speaks about how she agreed to use her TVfame to help the nation's space program recruit minorities andwomen.   But perhaps the program's best moments come when individualssimply are allowed to talk about what they do, or about theirexperiences in space if they've been there, without a big dealbeing made about what ``first'' they accomplished.   It's good that viewers, particularly young ones, know whatblacks have faced in the space program, and prior to that _ such astheir struggle to fly combat missions in the racially segregatedmilitary of World War II.   But sometimes it's just as helpful to just listen to someonelike Marine Col. Charles F. Bolden Jr., who flew the space shuttleColumbia in 1986, talk about the space program or his memories ofMcNair.   He's articulate and obviously loves his work. He shows thattoday's Right Stuff cadre has no color, only desire, courage,education and ability.</TEXT><TEXT>   Elsewhere in television...
