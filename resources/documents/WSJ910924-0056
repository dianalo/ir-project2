With tough new federal sentencing guidelines due to takeeffect Nov. 1, companies such as Westinghouse, Corning,Gillette and Waste Management are reviewing their systems forensuring that workers comply with the law. The guidelinescall for sentences as high as $290 million or more, butjudges could reduce them sharply for companies that havestrong compliance efforts.</LP><TEXT>   A company that cooperates with authorities and has a goodcompliance program could see its $10 million fine for fraudreduced to $250,000 or less, says Jeffrey Kaplan, a New Yorkattorney. To qualify for leniency, firms would have to havesuch safeguards as employee training programs, complianceofficers, strong auditing practices and systems to ensurethat wrongdoing is reported.   Given the possible sentences under the new guidelines,&quot;we'd be crazy not to&quot; review compliance efforts, saysPolaroid spokesman Michael Spataro.                                                                                                          PERFORMANCE-BASED PAY catches on for top executives.   In a study of 300 companies, KPMG Peat Marwick found thatchief executives' pay increasingly tracks companyperformance. For instance, pay for one group of chiefexecutives last year rose an average 22.1% after theircompanies realized an average 27.4% return on equity. Butexecutive pay dropped 14.2% for a group whose return declinedan average 2%.   &quot;This is the first time we have witnessed wide spreads inbonuses -- a clear indication of the desire to link pay withperformance,&quot; says Peter Chingos, the firm's chiefcompensation consultant. But the portion of firms offeringbonuses and other incentive plans to nonexecutives hasleveled off at 51%, after growing steadily through the 1980s,according to Sibson andamp; Co.                                                                                                          SALARY OFFERS for most new college graduates are generallyrestrained.   Business administration graduates this year received joboffers paying an average $24,019, up 2.1% from last year,according to a College Placement Council survey. Offers foraccounting students rose just 1%, to an average $26,642.Criminal-justice grads on average were offered $22,280, anincrease of 7.4%, while sociology majors were offered$20,431, up just 1.5%.   Offers to graduates in petroleum engineering rose 10.5%,to an average $38,882, and offers to geology grads rose asteep 21.3%, to $28,463. But amid defense industry cutbacks,offers to aerospace-engineering graduates rose less than 1%,to $30,667. And offers for nuclear engineers declined. Offersto foreign language students dropped 8.8%, to an average$21,526.   The labor shortage helped produce a 7.3% rise in theaverage offer for graduates in health-care fields, to$29,443.                                                                                                          RECRUITMENT ADVERTISING doesn't lead to jobs for manycollege students, say two consultants. A Hanigan ConsultingGroup survey showed that 71% of companies advertise oncampus, generating an average 11,865 resumes each, eventhough less than 10% of their hires come from that source. Ina survey by M.E. Scott andamp; Co., the majority of students ratedsuch advertising as &quot;neutral&quot; or &quot;useless.&quot;                                                                                                          DEMAND RISES for telecommunications experts, even as jobprospects for most other computer specialists hit a 10-yearlow, says Roger O'Connor of Edward Perlin Associatesmanagement consultants. Communications systems are soimportant that companies can't afford to scrimp on them, andcorporate staff cuts increase the need to keep them runningsmoothly, he explains.                                                                                                          CONSIDER THE SOURCE: American executives, by aneight-to-one margin, are adopting more casual dress, yet thevast majority of them favor decorative over utilitarianfurnishings, according to two recent surveys. The studieswere conducted, respectively, by athletic shoe manufacturerConverse Inc. and Art Specialty Co., a maker of decorativelamps.                                                                                                          HOUSING ASSISTANCE gains as an employee benefit.   The Federal National Mortgage Association has committed$300 million out of a $1 billion pool created this year tofinance employer-assisted home mortgages. In Boston, 175hotel and restaurant employees have applied for the first$500,000 in housing aid from a new employer-financed fund.And the University of Pennsylvania finances employeemortgages throughout west and southwest Philadelphia,widening the program's reach.   Church andamp; Dwight in Piscataway, N.J., lends employees up to15% of the cost of their homes; it forgives the loans forworkers who remain on the job for five years and perform somecommunity service. A group of employers near the Universityof California at Santa Barbara just sold employees 16condominiums at prices 20% below market; the buyers had toaccept limits on what they can charge on resale.   To attract doctors to the San Francisco Bay area, KaiserPermanente guarantees loans for 95% of the value of homes upto $400,000.
