The oil and gas concern declined to estimate quarterly earnings. For the year-earlier quarter, Arch reported a loss of $41,000 on revenue of $158,000.    Arch had taken on the installment debt to help finance its $1.9 million acquisition in July 1986 of 1.5 million common shares, or 32%, of Usenco Inc., an oil and gas exploration company.    As part of the transaction, the company said it granted options to buy a total of 300,000 Arch common shares at market prices to an Arch director, Johnny H. Vinson, and the controlling holder, Threshold Development Co., who pledged collateral necessary for the bank financing used to make the $1.4 million payment. Threshold is an oil and gas holding company here.    Arch has 3.5 million common shares outstanding. </TEXT></DOC>
