But the vote, 237-187, fell short of the two-thirds voteneeded to override the presidential veto predicted earlierthis week by White House Chief of Staff John Sununu.</LP><TEXT>   Administration officials say President Bush believes thegovernment shouldn't force employers to offer specificbenefits. Business groups, fearing the leave bill could leadto mandated health insurance, vehemently opposed the measureon that basis.   Rep. Fred Grandy, the Iowa Republican who led the fightagainst the measure, said he was cautiously optimistic thatthe narrow House vote would dim the bill's prospects in theSenate, where a similar bill would grant workers 10 weeks ofunpaid family leave annually and another 13 weeks of unpaidpersonal medical leave over a two-year period.   It is uncertain when the Senate will take up the matterfor consideration. Both measures exempt very small businessesbased on the number of employees.   But Rep. Patricia Schroeder, (D., Colo.), who firstintroduced the Family and Medical Leave Act in 1985, said shewas &quot;delighted&quot; with the vote. &quot;I think we're in the ballpark {for overriding any veto}. Congress understands whatAmerican families are going through. People stood up and didwhat they think is right.&quot;   The House bill sets a total of three months of unpaidleave to cover either the employee's own medical emergencies,the care of newborn or adopted children or the care ofseriously ill family members. Businesses would be required tocontinue health benefits during the period.   Sponsors of the House measure said the legislation wouldcost businesses close to $200 million annually to cover thecost of health benefits for workers on leave and the cost oftraining temporary replacements.   Companies with fewer than 50 employees aren't covered bythe measure. The provisions, a compromise fashioned by Reps.Bart Gordon (D., Tenn.) and Curt Weldon, (R., Pa.), scaledback Rep. Schroeder's original measure that set separateleave periods for family and medical needs.   During the floor debate, Reps. Vic Fazio, (D., Calif.) andDemocratic Majority Leader Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.) spokeof their personal family crises when their childrencontracted cancer. Rep. Raymond McGrath, (R., N.Y.), said hisfamily recently had to hire a full-time nurse to care for hismother who needs round-the-clock care. &quot;We turn away fromthis at our peril,&quot; Mr. Fazio said. &quot;It's tough enough forfamilies to make it economically in this country. I hopewe'll have at least the compassion to make this one stepforward.&quot;   Illinois Republican Henry Hyde, known for hisanti-abortion views, said that he &quot;agonized over the bill.I'm not appalled by federal mandates; we do it for jury dutyand ROTC. . . .society should encourage motherhood and notabortions.&quot;   Opponents of the bill emphasized that mandating familyleave would reverse the trend toward letting workersnegotiate with employers for the benefits they prefer andfavor high-income workers who can better afford to takeunpaid time off.   &quot;The government can't balance the budget, it can't controlspending, yet it's trying to micromanage the private sector,&quot;said John Sloan, president of the National Federation ofIndependent Business, a small-business group. But a lobbyistfor the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, MaryTavenner, said that faced with the presidential veto threat,the vote &quot;sends a clear signal that this bill is technicallydead in the water.&quot; The groups represent small and largecompanies.   Rep. Marge Roukema, (R., N.J.), one of the bill'sco-sponsors, said that after the vote, she asked, for thesecond time this week, that Republican supporters of themeasure get a chance to air their views at the White House.   She said the administration's threat to veto the bill inits present form used the usual &quot;good cop-bad cop&quot; languagethat the administration adopts as it enters intonegotiations. She added that the measure's level ofbipartisan support and its concern for legitimate businessinterests could ultimately get the president's support.</TEXT></DOC>
