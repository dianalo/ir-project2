Piles of garbage, wood and coal sit outside her front door. This has been her home for more than 20 years, and no doubt she will die here. &quot;I just love it between these mountains,&quot; she says.    But these days Beth Daniell seems more typical. An assistant professor of English at West Virginia University in Morgantown for two years, she finally wearied of being threatened with forced furloughs and unsigned paychecks. So, like thousands of others, she left the state this year. She took a teaching job in Chicago that pays 40% more. Because of the shrinking population, now less than 1.9 million, there is a good chance the state will lose one of its four House seats after the next U.S. census in 1990. The emigration, some figure, rivals the exodus from Oklahoma in the Dust Bowl of the 1930s.    &quot;West Virginia,&quot; Ms. Daniell says, &quot;plays with people's lives.&quot;    Poverty is nothing new here. Yet it persists after six years of national prosperity, the longest peacetime expansion in U.S. history. A lack of jobs plagues the state. West Virginians remain poorer, sicker and and less educated than most Americans. Poor-boy-style corruption corrodes the body politic and the civic soul.    Says John Purbaugh, a Charleston environmentalist: &quot;We're like an animal that not only has neglected the tone of its muscle and the health of its flesh, but has failed to give the necessary minerals to its skeleton.&quot; Things are in such a mess that Democratic Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd is leaving his powerful post next year for the Senate Appropriations Committee, better to steer federal dollars homeward to West Virginia.    Not that West Virginia has a monopoly on hardship. Louisiana may be worse off. And there are other parts of Appalachia -- an area that extends across all of West Virginia and parts of 12 other states -- that are characterized by staggering unemployment and poverty.    There is magic here -- Miss Ella's beloved poplar- and maple-covered mountains, rising majestically from green valleys -- and it offers a certain solace to many West Virginians. In the days when America moved the goods of its farms and factories by water, the mountains were no hindrance to the state's economy. In fact, they were rich in coal. In the late 19th century, Wheeling was America's richest city in per capita income. But as the nation turned first to railroads and then to trucks to move its output, the mountains discouraged the building of modern highways, factories and industrial parks.    &quot;This isn't like Kansas, where Dorothy and Toto can do whatever the hell they want,&quot; says Lysander L. Dudley Sr., the state's director of community and industrial development.    Still, several large companies, including American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., have begun operations in West Virginia recently. After legislators tore down certain barriers to business and boosted tax incentives in 1986, $1 billion in investment income poured into the state, more than in the seven previous years combined.    Parkersburg's downtown shopping area, Town Centre, is as stylish as Atlanta's Peachtree Plaza or Baltimore's Harbor Place. More West Virginia products, from hot tubs to timber to coal, are being exported than ever before. The state is working hard to attract campers, skiers and fishermen for its burgeoning tourist trade.    Like the fresh gold leaf on the state capitol dome, however, the gains veneer an underlying weakness. For most West Virginians, economic opportunity is as remote as ever. There isn't any true metropolis with a self-generating economy. Where most residents live, in towns and backwood hollows, the devastation is plain. Streets in poor southern counties look as if they have been bombed and abandoned. Even in the more-prosperous northern counties, poverty remains widespread.    In the northern panhandle city of Wheeling, E.M. George says investors &quot;don't think of West Virginia as a growth area.&quot; The president of the biggest bank in town, Wheeling Dollar, leans across his desk and says, &quot;I hope we can hold our own. I can't see much growth either.&quot;    Wheeling, with a population of 43,000, is struggling. In its heyday it made steel, fancy glassware -- Fostoria, Imperial and Homer Laughlin -- and cigars. (Local factories, it is claimed, coined the word &quot;stogie,&quot; an allusion to the cigar-smoking drivers of Conestoga wagons.) But the last major glass factory closed three years ago and neither bankrupt Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. nor neighboring Weirton Steel Corp. employ the masses they used to.    Some say the only chance for the city -- and the rest of the state -- lies in diversification. Community leaders envision &quot;Software Valley,&quot; a high-technology corridor along I-79 from Wheeling to Pittsburgh. They want to lure companies that, among other things, will create a computer language for Defense Department weapons.    Despite Sen. Byrd's support, the three-year-old project is barely off the ground, and a new president could change Pentagon priorities. Already, West Virginia rates dead last among the states in per capita funds for federal projects. Software Valley, says West Virginia economist Bill Miernyk, &quot;will continue to be a dream.&quot;    The quickest route from Wheeling to Charleston, the state's hub, is a 1 1/2-hour swing through Ohio, testifying to West Virginia's inadequate road system. Since the 1950s, it has cost twice the national average to build a mile of highway through this hard-scrabble state.    Charleston sits in the Kanawha Valley, also known as Chemical Valley. One of the highest concentrations of chemical plants in the nation, its hulking factories whir and hiss, pumping steam into a hazy, burnt-orange sky. Union Carbide Corp., Monsanto Corp. and FMC Corp. have made a home here, their smokestacks mingling on the skyline with church spires.    Development has carried a price. A federal health investigation in April found that, among the valley's petrochemical workers, the death rate from blood cancer was 40% higher than the national rate. The liver cancer rate was 74% higher.    There are other health problems. West Virginia has the country's highest cervical cancer rate, in part because women in rural areas can't afford or don't have access to routine PAP tests. Poor diets foster an above-average incidence of obesity and heart disease. Smoking -- increasingly a poor person's habit -- helps boost the state's lung disease rate to 39% above the national average.    Such sad matters seem remote inside the capitol. Here, legislators are just trying to pay the bills. Although a new $1.46 billion budget went into effect July 1, the start of the fiscal year, last year's state financial crisis continues to impinge on schools, hospitals, libraries, banks, sheriff's departments and small businesses. Some public employees still have to pay cash for medical care because of an underfunded state insurance pool.    And the future is daunting. Already, the state is running $15 million behind its projected revenue for the year. Many fear a repeat of last year's severe crunch -- especially after the gubernatorial elections in November, when constituencies now being courted for their political support could suddenly find themselves short on funds.    More fearful perhaps are teachers. Last year, local school systems had to sue to recover $112 million owed them by the state. The money began trickling down only after the government borrowed from its own investment fund. A 5% teacher's pay increase, promised by Gov. Arch A. Moore, never arrived.    Broken promises of better education are nothing new to Lincoln County, south of Charleston across the Little Coal River. Nona Conley, a 48-year-old mother of four, figures three of four adults here are illiterate.    When Ms. Conley worked at a local grocery, teen-agers threw their money down for her to count, because they couldn't. Even growing up in rural Nebraska, Ms. Conley says, she had a better education by the fourth grade than her daughters did after graduating from high school here.    Money is part of the problem. Property taxes are the schools' main source of revenue, but assessments haven't undergone a statewide reappraisal in three decades. So they vary from one county to the next, at the whims of elected assessors. In 1978, Ms. Conley and other parents sued Lincoln County to raise taxes payable by its biggest corporate landowners, mostly out-of-state concerns. Since 1939 they had been paying just 12 cents an acre in property taxes.    The parents won. Now, Columbia Gas Co. pays 82 cents an acre. Ms. Conley pays $1.25 an acre on her 96 acres.    Route 119, the road from Lincoln to Mingo County, cuts through topless, black-streaked mountains: coal country. There is still coal, and controversy, aplenty here. Environmentalists see the state's Department of Energy as more cheerleader than regulator -- it is mandated to be both -- and say the state grants strip-mine permits to owners with long histories of mining violations. &quot;It's difficult to serve two masters equally,&quot; says Mr. Purbaugh, the Charleston environmentalist.    Tom Reishman, second in command at the state Department of Energy, counters: &quot;It's our mandate that we balance our roles, and I think we have the proper perspective.&quot;    West Virginia produces nearly 15% of the nation's coal. Because of mechanization, however, only 5% of the state's labor force works in the mines. Because supplies of coal are so plentiful, the price is low and seems destined to remain so.    Williamson, the seat of Mingo County, calls itself &quot;the home of the billion-dollar coal field.&quot; The county is also known for its million-dollar corruption. Since 1986, 62 local officials, including two sheriffs, a police chief and a fire chief, have been convicted. The Kermit police chief, Damid Ramey, was convicted of drug conspiracy and drug delivery, among other offenses, and the town's fire chief, Wilburn Preece, was convicted of drug conspiracy and filing false tax returns. Both went to jail.    Political control of the few jobs in the area fostered lawlessness, says Joe Savage, a federal prosecutor. Larry Hamrick, school board president and director of the local poverty program, was able to hand out 2,400 jobs himself in a county where the total number was only 8,700. He was convicted of drug conspiracy, obstruction of justice and conspiracy to defraud the poverty program. The evidence showed he had helped fix two juries, and threatened to choke to death a woman witness against him. He too was given a jail term.    &quot;If you're poor, you wanted to make sure Larry Hamrick was in a position to give your dad a job as a bus driver,&quot; says Mr. Savage, who successfully prosecuted him. That is why people sold their votes to Mr. Hamrick, he says, blaming corruption on &quot;the whole social structure.&quot;    Mingo County has cleaned up. But will it stay that way? &quot;Given the overwhelming economic and historical pressures, I don't know,&quot; Mr. Savage says.    Route 52, a stretch of blacktop that rounds the mountains in a series of 90-degree angles, connects Mingo with McDowell County. Its unemployment rate, officially 21.4%, is the highest in the state. Residents say 75% is closer to reality. The state's rate was 9% in July, second worst in the country.    About three years ago, the last coal mine near Keystone, in McDowell County, closed. To create new work, Robert and Betty Drake, an Episcopal deacon and his wife, started a tiny canoe factory. It employs two men. In McDowell County, this is progress.    Roofless, hollow buildings line Keystone's few paved streets. Trash clogs its creeks. Miss Ella clings to her hills, but the Drakes, who have spent three years ministering here, are thinking of moving on. &quot;It seems a little crazy to me,&quot; says Mr. Drake. &quot;If I was a native, I wouldn't stick around.&quot;    &quot;Hillbilly Highway&quot; -- I-77, about 25 miles east of Keystone -- has carried thousands of workers away to service-industry jobs in the Carolinas and Virginia. Those left behind are trying to hold their communities together.    In Clarksburg, a city of 23,000 in the north-central part of the state, Bruce Carter says he has been forced to run the United Hospital Center with &quot;one finger in the dike.&quot; Because the state was millions of dollars behind in Medicaid and public employee insurance payments, Mr. Carter, president of the 390-bed acute care facility, halted practically all equipment purchases, cut 90 staff positions and delayed payments to suppliers.    Desperate, he went to Gov. Moore earlier this year to beg for the money owed United Hospital. &quot;I asked that he triage our bleeding,&quot; Mr. Carter says. The state borrowed the money from its black-lung insurance fund, and Mr. Carter says things have eased considerably since July.    But Stevens Clinic, in McDowell County, had to close. Two smaller rural hospitals have been reduced to outpatient clinics. Preston County's birthing center is staffed only by a midwife and a family practitioner. Its two obstetricians left last year.    &quot;Morale stinks,&quot; says Cheryl B. Torsney, a colleague of Beth Daniell's at West Virginia State in Morgantown. She moved with her husband, Jack, from Mississippi three years ago. He is an outpatient therapist in Preston County. &quot;At least Mississippi is in the Sun Belt,&quot; he says. &quot;And it's accessible. And even the bad roads, you can still drive on them.    &quot;Here there's no education. No industry. What the hell does West Virginia got? You drive through and say, 'Those mountains are damn nice. Let's go to Maryland.'&quot;    ---                 West Virginia at a Glance    Population:       1.9 million -- 34th in nation    Projected 1988 voting population by race:       Whites 96.7%       Blacks 2.9%       Hispanics 0.4%    Average expenditure per pupil in public schools:       28th in nation    Physicians per 100,000 population:       33rd in nation    Labor force:       White collar 47.2%       Blue collar 34.9%    Unemployment:       9.6%    Manufacturing jobs 19809-87:       - 27%</TEXT></DOC>
