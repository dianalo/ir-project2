(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Democratic presidential front-runnerMichael Dukakis is criticizing the administration's reported dealto dismiss charges against Panama's military leader, saying ``Idon't believe you drop indictments against suspected drug runnersand murderers.''   Dukakis was beginning his first full day of West Coastcampaigning today with events across California after stoppingbriefly in Portland Thursday night. Tuesday's contest in Oregon isa prelude to his final round of primaries against Jesse Jackson onJune 7 in California and New Jersey.   Holding a long lead in delegates going into the final fewprimaries, Dukakis continued to focus on the Reagan administrationas he reacted to reports the administration had offered to dropfederal drug-trafficking charges against Panama's Gen. ManuelAntonio Noriega if he would step down as the country's leader.   ``I think before we start talking about dropping indictments andmaking deals, the American people deserve a full explanation ofwhat kind of relationship this administration has had withNoriega,'' Dukakis said.   ``I don't believe you drop indictments against suspected drugrunners and murderers,'' Dukakis said earlier before arriving inOregon.   Dukakis continued the criticism during his brief stop inPortland. He also jabbed at Reagan over recent disclosures that thepresident's schedule has been guided through the use of astrologyby his wife, Nancy.   ``Eight months from now, the Reagan era will be over,'' Dukakissaid at a mock political convention by Oregon high school students.``America will have a new president. We'll be putting away ourhoroscopes.''   As he increasingly turns his criticism on the Republicans andtheir expected nominee, Vice President George Bush, Dukakis hasmade a common theme of challenging the administration for dealingquietly with the Panamanian strongman.   Bush, Democrats contend, should have had knowledge of Noriegagoing back to the vice president's days as head of the CIA, andmore recently as head of an administration task force to stopillegal drug smuggling.   Noriega and U.S. officials have been negotiating in recentmonths to solve the problem posed by his continued position ofpower in the face of U.S. indictments alleging deep involvement inlarge-scale drug operations.   Noriega's continuing presence has been regarded as anembarrassment for the administration and a political problem forBush.   ``The administration got into this soup. It isn't going well,and it looks to me as if they're desperate to get out of it,''Dukakis said.   Dukakis made the comments as he devoted much of the day tomaking the rounds of Democratic congressional leaders in Washington_ sessions in keeping with his role as likely party nominee andaimed at assuring Capitol Hill Democrats he wants to cooperate.   In the process he picked up the endorsement of Senate MajorityLeader Robert Byrd. Dukakis overwhelmingly won this week'spresidential primary in West Virginia, Byrd's home state. He wasalso endorsed by House Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski,D-Ill.   Byrd said Dukakis had run a positive campaign that would helpthe party unite. He said it was time for Democrats to gather aroundthe Massachusetts governor as its standard bearer for the fall.   ``He has not dipped into the trough and gone negative,'' Byrdsaid. ``We need to begin to close ranks, and that's what we'redoing today.''   Dukakis also met with House Speaker Jim Wright, who refused toanswer when asked if he was endorsing the governor. When asked,Wright responded in Spanish with what amounted to a no comment.   Dukakis also met with House Majority Leader Tom Foley, D-Wash.,who also withheld an endorsement. When asked about Foley as arunning mate, Dukakis smiled and turned to him with the samequestion he once put to Jackson when they shared a stage and thesame question arose: ``Are you interested in it?''   Foley smiled but made no audible reply.</TEXT></DOC>
