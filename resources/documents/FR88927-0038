The Department has classified this action as non-major.The effect of this action on the economy will be less than $100 million.This action will have no effect on costs or prices. Competition, employment,investment, productivity, and innovation will remain unaffected. Therewill be no effect on the competition of United States-based enterpriseswith foreign-based enterprises.Executive Order 12372The Food Stamp Program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic AssistancePrograms under No. 10.551. For the reasons set forth in the final rulerelated Notice(s) of 7 CFR Part 3015, Subpart V (48 FR 29115), this programis excluded from the scope of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmentalconsultation with State and local officials.Regulatory Flexibility ActThis action has been reviewed with regard to the requirements of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-354, Stat. 1164, September 19, 1980).S. Anna Kondratas, Administrator of the Food and Nutrition Service, hascertified that this action does not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities. State and local welfare agencieswill be the most affected as they administer the Program.Paperwork Reduction ActIn accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507),the reporting and recordkeeping requirements contained in this regulationhave been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under theAct. The OMB approval number for these requirements is 0584-0339.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>This rulemaking proposes a performance-based measure and allocation methodto distribute $7.5 million in Employment and Training Program grant fundsto State agencies to assist the States in meeting their administrativecosts in operating Eandamp;T programs.The employment and training provisions of the Food Stamp Act of 1977 wereenacted ``for the purpose of assisting members of households participatingin the Food Stamp Program in gaining skills, training or experience thatwill increase their ability to obtain regular employment.'' (7 U.S.C. 2015(d)(4)(A))These previsions were implemented in the final regulations issued on December31, 1986 (51 FR 35152). A major point of emphasis in the legislation isthat State agencies be provided flexibility in designing the programs theywish to operate. The role of the Department in approving State plans andmonitoring State agency performance is to ensure that each State agencyoperates a meaningful program that enables its able-bodied stamp recipientsto improve their employment prospects.The Department believes that achievement of these goals can be enhancedby using a performance-based measure and allocation method to allocateamong the State agencies some of the grant funds available. By doing so,the Department will reward State agencies for good performance and willthereby provide extra incentive for State agencies to perform well. TheDepartment announced its intention to use such a method to allocate $15million in grant funds in the preamble to the December 31, 1986 rule. (51Fr 35152, 35155) For Fiscal Year 1989 this amount has been reduced by one-halfto enable State agencies to maximize their expenditures, but will be setat $15 million in subsequent years.<ITAG tagnum="84">Performance-Based Funding</ITAG>Public Law 99-198 amend the Food Stamp Act of 1977 (7 U.S.C. 2011 <T3>et seq.</T3>) to authorize the Department of Agriculture to distributeamong State agencies $60 million in Eandamp;T grants in Fiscal Year 1988and $75 million in each of Fiscal Years 1989 and 1990. (In addition toEandamp;T grants which require no State matching, State agencies also receiveFederal matching funds for approved expenditures for participant reimbursementsup to $12.50 per participant per month and 50 percent reimbursement foradditional administrative costs above the initial Federal grant.)Current regulations allocate Eandamp;T grant money according to each Stateagency's food stamp caseload as a percentage of the country's total foodstamp caseload. (7 CFR 273.7(d)) This ratio determines each State agency'sportion of the available grant funds. The Department will allocate theadditional $7.5 million in FY 1989 and $15 million in subsequent yearsaccording to a measure of each State agency's performance in operatingemployment and training programs relative to the performance of all StateagenciesTo arrive at a performance measure, the Department considered a varietyof input, process and outcome measures. Input measures, such as the numberof work registrants in a State, would base performance-based funding shareson the potential size or cost of a State's Eandamp;T program. (In and ofthemselves, however, input measures would be a poor means of determiningperformance, although they could be used in conjunction with other measuresto rank States in terms of cost-effectiveness or by the percentage of thepotential caseload being served.) Process measures would emphasize therelative level of Eandamp;T activities among State agencies by tracking thenumber of food stamp recipients who actually participate in Eandamp;T activitiesor are otherwise dealt with by program operators. Outcome measures wouldeither track participants during or after Eandamp;T involvement, or use aproxy to determine a program's success in helping participants reach apredetermined goal, such as the number of participants who obtain jobsand therefore receive fewer food stamp benefits.The Department is proposing to use a process measure which calculates thetotal number of each eligible State agency's Eandamp;T mandatory placementsas a percentage of all the State agencies' Eandamp;T mandatory participantseligible to be placed. An Eandamp;T mandatory participants is defined asa food stamp program applicant or participant who is required to work registerunder 7 U.S.C. 2014(d)(1) or (2) and who the State determines should notbe exempted from participation in an employment and training program. Stateagencies may consider a person placed if the person commences an employmentand training component, or fails to comply with Eandamp;T requirements andis sent a Noticed of Adverse Action for noncompliance. (Eligibility forperformance-based funding will be explained later in this preamble.) Thispercentage would then be multiplied by $7.5 million FY 1989 and $15 millionin later years, to arrive at each State agency's share of performance-basedfunding.The Department is proposing this measure for several reasons. First, usingthis measure would provide more money to those State agencies which aremore active than others in providing training and services to food stampparticpants and in taking administrative action in accordance with regulatoryrequirements against noncompliant individuals. Second, this will provideStates with an incentive to serve Eandamp;T mandatory participants, the populationfor whom food stamp Eandamp;T is intended. We do not believe that the Departmentis providing a disincentive to States which wish to serve volunteers, andwill continue counting volunteers toward achievement of performance standards.Third, this measure will use data which all State agencies should be collectingand reporting consistently. Data necessary for an outcome performance standardare not now available. State agencies are not currently required to trackand report on participants who obtain jobs, the types of jobs they obtain,or the effects of employment or disqualifications on program costs. Onexamination, other proxies of program outcomes, such as a comparison ofthe number of work registrants in different time periods, were judged tobe too dependent on factors (such as general economic conditions) to bea fair measure of a State agency's Eandamp;T program. The Department hasdecided, therefore, that the number of Eandamp;T mandatory participants reportedas placed by State is currently the best measure for distributing performance-basedfunding.<ITAG tagnum="84">Measurement Period for Performance-Based Funding</ITAG>The Department is proposing that the measurement period for each fiscalyear's funding be the calendar which ends three quarters before the beginningof the pertinent fiscal year. For example, data from Calendar Year 1988would be used to determine performance-based funding allocations for FiscalYear 1990. This schedule would apply for each year after Fiscal Year 1989,the first year in which performance-based funding will be distributed.For Fiscal Year 1989, only data from the second, third and fourth quartersof Calendar Year 1987 would be used, because employment and training programswere not implemented until April, 1987. This schedule will enable the Departmentto notify State agencies prior to the beginning of each fiscal year ofthe portion of the enhanced funding they will receive that year. This schedulewould then allow State agencies to effectively plan for the use of theperformance-based funding. The schedule also minimizes the period of timebetween the end of the measurement period and issuance of allocation amounts,while using data due to be reported early enough for there to be some timeto resolve questions on the data, such as discrepancies between monthly,quarterly and annual figures, or to obtain missing categories of data.For Fiscal Year 1989, however, performance-based funding cannot be allocateduntil final regulations are pulished. This will not occur before the FiscalYear 1989 Eandamp;T plans are due to be submitted. For Fiscal Year 1989,therefore, State agencies will receive extra performance-based fundingafter the start of the fiscal year. While this is not ideal, the Departmentbelieves it is preferable to move to a performance-based measure afterthe start of Fiscal Year 1989, rather than to distribute an additional$7.5 million according to the current, general allocation formula in FiscalYear 1989 only to remove it from the general allocation base in FiscalYear 1990.<ITAG tagnum="84">Eligibility for Performance-Based Funding</ITAG>The performance-based funding method proposed in this rule is not the onlymeasure of State agency Eandamp;T performance that has a financial impact.Current regulations provide that, starting in Fiscal Year 1989, State agenciesmust meet performance standards or be liable for a financial sanction.These performance standards require 35 percent of the State agency's non-exemptwork registrants to begin a component or be referred for sanction duringboth the first quarter of Fiscal Year 1989 and the remainder of FiscalYear 1989. (Fiscal Year 1989 is somewhat unusual because it is the onlyyear in which State agencies must meet a standard for the first quarterand one for the remaining three quarters of the year.) The performancestandard level increases to 50 percent for Fiscal Year 1990. Under currentregulations, the Department will inform State agencies of performance standardrequirements for following years at a later time. State agencies may request,and have approved prospectively, lower performance standards for a fiscalyear if they supply convincing justification that a lower standard is warranteddue to the types of individuals they are serving or high-intensity componentsbeing offered. If a State agency does not meet its performance standard,it loses a portion of its administrative funding equal to the percentageby which it failed to meet its performance standard, multiplied by itsEandamp;T grant.Because the use of a ratio of State agency placements to national placementsprovides a portion of performance-based funding to those State agencieswhich are being financially penalized for poor performance, the Departmentis proposing to limit the eligibility for performance-based funding startingin Fiscal Year 1991 to State agencies which have met their performancestandards, as set forth in andSection; 273.7(o), for the second prior fiscalyear. (For Fiscal Year 1991, the Fiscal Year 1989 standard must be met.)The delay in applying this provision is because performance standards takeeffect for the first time in Fiscal Year 1989. For example, if a Stateagency does not meet each of the performance standards for Fiscal Year1989 (for the first quarter and the remaining three quarters), then itwould be ineligible for any performance-based funding for Fiscal Year 1991.If a State agency does not meet the 50 percent performance standard forFiscal Year 1990, then it would be ineligible for any share of Fiscal Year1992 performance-based funding. As stated above, State agencies may requestand have approved prospectively lower performance standards for a fiscalyear, if they supply convincing justification. If a State agency has hadits performance standard lowered prospectively, it need meet only thatlower standard to be eligible for a portion of the performance-based fundingpool. State agencies which are determined to be ineligible for any performance-basedfunding in a given year will have their placements omitted in computingthe national placement total when calculating performance-based sharesfor eligible State agencies.Because the Department intends to inform State agencies in May or Juneof each year of the funding shares available for the following fiscal yearfor Eandamp;T grants, including any performance-based funding, the Departmentneeds to establish a final date by which reports must be received in orderfor the data to be considered. The FNS-583 report is due to the appropriateregional office 45 days following the end of a quarter. The Departmentexpects reports to be submitted by this date. However, in order to clearlystate how late reports will be treated, this rule proposes that any reportreceived by FNS later than March 1 shall not be considered when performance-basedfunding is calculated for the fiscal year beginning the next October. Additionally,if a State agency has not submitted all reports for the prior fiscal year(the last of which is due by mid-November) and, due to missing reports,the Department cannot determine whether the State agency has met the pertinentperformance standard, the State agency will not be eligible to receiveany performance-based funding for the fiscal year beginning the followingOctober.This rule also proposes that the data used to determine whether a Stateagency has met its performance standard in order to be considered eligiblefor performance-based funding shall be the data that is submitted on thequarterly reports for a fiscal year. Even if a State agency files an appealto show that it had good cause for not meeting its performance standard,the results of that hearing would not render the State agency eligiblefor a share of the performance-based funding, if the data it submittedshows that its performance was below the standard. The appeal, of course,would have an impact on whether the State agency is sanctioned for failureto meet the standard. The proposed approach is necessary in order to ensurethat the distribution of performance-based funding is not belatedly orrepeatedly modified for all State agencies, based on the results of hearingsof a small number of State agencies.<ITAG tagnum="84">Outcome Measures</ITAG>This proposed measure does not attempt to distribute funding based on theoutcomes of participation in food stamp employment and training programs(such as the number of participants who obtain regular employment). Wecurrently do not require State agencies to track participants to determinewho obtains jobs. We believe that outcome-based performance measures maybe more appropriate as the employment and training program matures, andwill be exploring this option in the future. To that end, in addition tosoliciting comments on the approach proposed in this rulemaking, we arealso soliciting comments on whether performance-based funding should ultimatelyrely on outcome-based measures and recommendations on what those measuresshould be, as well as how State agencies should be required to gather andreport data to determine those measures.The Department is committed to distributing funding on the basis whichprovides the most effective incentives for realizing the goals of the Eandamp;TProgram. The Department views this proposed regulation as an interim measurewhich makes the best possible use of the existing data base. However, theDepartment is willing to require expanded data collection if any addedburden of data collection is outweighed by the benefits of better aligningfunding with performance. For example, measures of program outcomes suchas increased earnings and decreased dependency on food stamps may offerbetter evidence of program success than measures of the breadth of implementation.Outcome measures are not reported now and collecting them would entailincreased reporting requirements. The Department is soliciting commentson (1) the potential of different allocation methodologies for improvingservices to participants; (2) the effect of these methodologies on theequity of State agency funding; (3) the specifications for any new datato be collected; (4) the costs of any new data collection. If the responseto these issues indicates that there is a better methodology, the Departmentwill move as quickly as possible to replace the interim measures developedas a result of this rulemaking with the better approach.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 273</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedures, Aliens, Claims, Food Stamps, Fraud,Grant programs_social programs, Penalties, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements, Social Security, Students.For the reasons set out in the preamble, 7 CFR Part 273 is proposed tobe amended as follows.<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 273_CERTIFICATION OF ELIGIBLE HOUSEHOLDS</ITAG>1.

Performance-based fundingshall be based on the number of E andamp; T mandatories placed in an eligibleState as a ratio of E andamp; T mandatory participants placed in all eligibleStates in the calendar year that ends nine months before the beginningof the fiscal year (e.g., Fiscal Year 1990 performance-based funding shallbe based on placements in Calendar Year 1988). In order to be eligiblefor a share of performance-based funding for Fiscal Year 1991, a Stateagency must have met its performance standard (as established prospectively)for the first quarter of Fiscal Year 1989 and its performance standardfor the final three quarters of Fiscal Year 1989. In order to be eligiblefor a share of performance-based funding for Fiscal Year 1992 or any fiscalyear thereafter, a State agency must have met its performance standard(as established prospectively) for the second preceding fiscal year (e.g.,to receive any performance-based funding for Fiscal Year 1992, a Stateagency must have met its performance standard for Fiscal Year 1990). Reportscontaining data on mandatories placed, described in andSection; 273.7(c)(6),(7), and (8), shall be received by FNS no later than March 1 in order tobe used in determining whether a State agency is eligible for performance-basedfunding and in calculating the performance-based funding share for thefiscal year beginning the following October. If the data on the reportsshow that a State agency did not meet its performance standard for thesecond preceding fiscal year or if missing reports prevent the Departmentfrom being able to determine if a State agency met such performance standard,data on placements by the State agency shall be completely disregardedwhen determining performance-based funding shares for other eligible Stateagencies. No State agency will be eligible for performance-based fundingif it has met its performance standard for the second preceding fiscalyear, regardless of whether a good cause appeal is filed.<ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Date: September 20, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Sonia F.
