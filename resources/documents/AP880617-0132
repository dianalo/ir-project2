In an 18-count indictment, they also were accused of launderingmore than $250,000 through a phony invoice scam to obtain cash forthe bribes and personal use, U.S. Attorney Andrew Maloney saidThursday.   The indictment issued by a federal grand jury in Brooklynoutlined a scheme that alleged the three paid $200,000 in bribesand kickbacks.   Esposito, 81, was described as a silent partner of the printingcompany, Beaumont Offset Corp. of Farmingdale, N.Y. The otherdefendants are Harry Dickran, president of Beaumont; and PhyllisZito, Esposito's daughter and secretary-treasurer of the company.   The charges are an offshoot of the investigation that led toEsposito's conviction last September for giving an illegal gratuityto U.S. Rep. Mario Biaggi, D-N.Y., Maloney said. Esposito isappealing the conviction.   ``He is an intimate part of a long continuing fraud on thegovernment,'' Maloney said of Esposito.   Esposito's lawyer, Edward Brodsky, said his client was innocentof the charges. Esposito was a powerful party boss from 1969 until1984.   ``Although he is now 81 years old and not in good health, hewill go to trial and prove to the entire world that he is notguilty,'' Brodsky said.   A woman who answered the phone at Beaumont said the company'sattorney was not available for comment.   The three are charged with violating interstate travel laws tocommit bribery, making false statements on Beaumont's tax returnsand conspiracy to make false statements on tax returns.   Dickran and Mrs. Zito were also charged with making falsestatements on their personal income tax returns.</TEXT></DOC>
