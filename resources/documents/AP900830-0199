(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Golden Arch Cafe serves upold-fashioned Coke floats and Salisbury steak platters, no Big Macsor McNuggets.   But McDonald's Corp. is hoping this small-town spinoff from the1950s will give the company a break in today's sluggish market forfast food.   McDonald's is stepping back in time _ and possibly creepingtoward a new franchise _ with a diner where you have to wait awhilefor the food but you get an ambience.   With chrome-glass decor, neon lights, spin-seat counter stools,cozy booths and a jukebox that blares '50s and '60s hits, the cafehas been under secret development for two years, targeted atcommunities with populations under 3,000. It debuted in this smallTennessee town last week.   ``Let's just call it the cafe of the '90s,'' said JohnCharlesworth, vice president for McDonald's Nashville region.``Small-town America is nostalgia. This place feels good, and thisconcept feels good to me.''   Aside from its name, which draws upon the famed golden archesoutside McDonald's outlets, there is little about the cafe tosuggest it is owned by the same people who introduced the world toQuarter-Pounders with cheese.   The typical menu fare includes a $2.99 Salisbury steak platterwith two vegetables, $3.99 lasagna, and Coke floats in real glassesat $1.19. Burgers and fries are there, too, but without theMc-names.   True, patrons must place their orders at a counter, similar tothe fast-food system. But afterward they find seats and cafeworkers dressed in 1950s-style bowling shirts serve them the foodon ceramic plates.   ``I think it's great,'' said Bob Rickman, 57, a local contractorlunching there during opening week. ``Hartsville needs it and Ihope they need Hartsville.''   McDonald's executives said the Hartsville restaurant is the onlyone planned for now.   Charlesworth said the town was chosen because it represents themodel locale where such a restaurant could thrive, a small townthat can't generate enough business for a regular McDonald's.Hartsville, population 2,674, is about 50 miles east of Nashville.   ``This is an opportunity to go places we normally might notgo,'' Charlesworth said.   The cafe's premiere was news to some analysts and competitors,who scrutinize everything McDonald's does because it shapes trendsin the industry.   ``Sounds like a New Jersey diner to me,'' said Joseph Doyle, afast-food strategist at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. in NewYork. He said the concept puzzled him, partly because it's solimited. ``If this thing works, why would they keep it just in thesmall towns?''   At least one McDonald's rival wasn't impressed.   ``What you're going to have is a McNightmare,'' predicted JohnMerritt, spokesman for Hardee's Food Systems Inc. ``They are themasters at what they do well, but when they get out of the coloringlines, it doesn't work as well.''   Hardee's calls itself the dominant fast-food restaurant in townsunder 10,000. The company's research shows customers go tofast-food restaurants in small towns for the same reasons as peoplein the city, Merritt said.   The cafe's debut comes at a time of slow sales for McDonald's,which has unsettled some investors and industry experts because thecompany historically has been considered one of the country's mostsuccessful businesses.   John Maxwell Jr., a securities analyst who follows the businessfor Wheat First Butcher andamp; Singer in Richmond, Va., said he wasn'tsurprised McDonald's would try a new concept. The company has beenexperimenting for years, from breakfast to pizza to salad bars.Some have endured while others have been quietly dropped.   ``McDonald's has tried about everything under the sun,'' Maxwellsaid. The cafe concept ``may or may not signal a new direction forthem.''</TEXT></DOC>
