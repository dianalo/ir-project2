The New YorkStock Exchange Composite Index sank 1.49, or 0.70%, while theDow Jones Industrial Average dropped 24.60, or 0.81%.   &quot;It looks like reality is starting to catch up with thehopes that things are going to turn around&quot; for the U.S.economy, said James Volk, director of OTC institutionaltrading at Charles Schwab andamp; Co. &quot;Except for stocks wherethere were {positive} stories, things were lower across theboard,&quot; he said.   Touching off investors' jitters about the economy were twonegative government reports yesterday morning. The LaborDepartment said that initial claims for state unemploymentinsurance rose by 29,000 in the week ended Oct. 12, comparedwith an expected increase of just 5,000. The CommerceDepartment reported that durablegoods orders fell 3.2% inSeptember. Analysts had expected a 0.9% decline.   &quot;There has been a lot of talk recently about the {savingsand loan} bailout, the budget deficit and taxes, and it'smaking people nervous,&quot; said Barry Berman, head of equitytrading at Robert W. Baird andamp; Co. Meanwhile, he said,volatility is rising, a sign that investors are increasinglytrading on emotions rather than fundamentals.   The Baird trader, though, said the market could easilyturn higher in the near term. &quot;I think there are a lot ofpools of money that are earmarked for short-term trading,&quot; hesaid. While these short-term traders have been sellersrecently, he said, they could quickly become buyers again.   Sun Microsystems fell after its report that first-quarternet totaled just 27 cents a share, up from 26 cents lastyear, but well off the mean analyst forecast of 34 cents ashare, according to First Call, a unit of Thomson FinancialNetworks.

Maxwell, an analyst at Soundview Financial, tied theactivity to cost-cutting moves announced Wednesday by NewYork Stock Exchange-listed Compaq Computer. AST lost 2 3/4Wednesday, while Dell slipped 2 1/4.   &quot;People now understand the circular psychology in thepricing environment,&quot; said Soundview's Mr. Maxwell. He saidinvestors are troubled by a &quot;Catch-22&quot; in the PC industry.With PC makers' margins already hurt by price cutting, hesaid, they are being forced to cut their manufacturing costsso they can afford to reduce product prices further.   Everex, another computer concern, added to the competitiveprice environment by announcing yesterday reductions on itsnotebook-size computers. Everex's shares lost 1/8 to 3.
