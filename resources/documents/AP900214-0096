The Airbus 320 crashed at 1 p.m. while on final approach to therunway at Bangalore airport, airline and airport officials said.   ``The crash occurred before the plane touched the runway, and itcaught fire as soon as it crashed,'' said P.S. Shetty, airportmanager in Bombay, where the hourlong flight had originated.   Airline officials said the plane, which was an hour behindschedule, carried 139 passengers and a crew of seven.   One airline official said 17 foreigners were believed to be onthe flight to Bangalore, one of India's richest cities and thecenter of the country's high-tech and research centers. Theyforeigners included a Frenchman, two Canadians, two Americans,three Japanese and a Hong Kong resident, all who survived, said thespokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity.   A spokesman for the airline in New Delhi reported earlier thatat least 135 people were killed. But airport officials in Bombayand doctors at hospitals where the victims were taken said 55people survived the crash and were being treated for broken bonesand burns.   ``They're alive. That's all I can say,'' said one doctor whodeclined to give his name.   News reports said the plane apparently undershot the runway byabout 50 yards. The Press Trust of India said the plane struck afence or an embankment as it was descending to the runway.   Local villagers rushed out of their huts and across the fieldlittered with baggage and debris toward the flaming wreckage. Localpolice were called to try to keep them away.   Airline officials did not know what caused the crash, but theysaid weather was not a factor. The jet was acquired by the nation'sgovernment-run domestic carrier about three months ago for $38million.   After Indian Airlines announced it was adding 31 Airbus 320s toits aging fleet of Boeing, Fokker and Avro planes, news reportscriticized the airline for failing to adequately train pilots tofly the sophisticated aircraft.   The carrier was also criticized for failing to provide adequatehangar space to house and maintain the planes.   The last Indian Airlines crash occurred Oct. 19, 1988, when aBoeing 737 crashed on final approach to an airport in the westerncity of Ahmedabad, killing 133 of the 135 people on board. Aninvestigation later blamed pilot error for the accident, the worstin the airline's 26-year history.   On the same day, a Fokker propeller-driven plane operated by theother domestic carrier, Vayudoot, slammed into the side of amountain during a fierce rainstorm. All 34 people on board died.   Indian Airlines, the major domestic carrier, flies to 73 citiesnationwide and to nine nearby countries. It has come undercriticism for allegedly failing to maintain pre-flight safetyprocedures on its fleet and to adequately supervise its pilots.Delays in flight schedules also are endemic.   Air India, also owned by the government, is the country'sinternational carrier.   The A320, built by the European consortium Airbus Industrie, isthe first civilian airliner equipped with a fully computerizedflight control system, which the manufacturer says permits safer,electronically controlled flight.   Developed at a cost of nearly $2 billion, the A320 was certifiedfor flight on Feb. 26, 1988, and went into service in April 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
