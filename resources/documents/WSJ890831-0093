It shows a king striding off to battle, clutching his sword, unwilling even to glance at the useful-looking machine gun sitting next to him.    &quot;I can't be bothered,&quot; the king says. &quot;We've got a battle to fight]&quot;    Mr. Marchessault had much the same problem in his own little kingdom, Business Card Service Inc. of Burnsville, Minn. &quot;I was up to my armpits filling orders, tracking mistakes, keeping files and was buried in manual paper work,&quot; says Mr. Marchessault, the 36-year-old vice president of the company.    But the cartoon made him decide that Business Card Service, with $2.5 million in annual sales, had no choice but to try something different. &quot;We were already working 60 or 70 hours a week, so a few more hours taken to get new ideas couldn't hurt any more,&quot; he says. The company installed a $650,000 computer system that sharply cuts the time it takes to fill orders, reduces paper work and eliminates printing errors.    Innovation, always difficult for any business, is especially hard to accomplish at smaller firms. Whether it's the need for a new product, a new manufacturing process, a new group of customers, or just a new computer, such long-range projects tend to get pushed aside by the crisis of the moment. Too bad.    &quot;Small-business managers often get so tied up in keeping up with daily problems that they lose track of the bigger picture,&quot; says Richard Dwyer, a consulting partner with Ernst andamp; Young, a major accounting firm. &quot;That's a big mistake because they're giving away their future.&quot;    The people who diagnose small-business problems for a living say that failure to innovate can be a killer. Companies can &quot;die from psycho-sclerosis or malignant status-quoism, both of which harden attitudes to new ideas,&quot; says Austin Pryor, Ernst andamp; Young's national director of innovation services. The problem afflicts companies large and small, but usually comes into public view only when the failure to innovate occurs on a grand scale -- as in the case of Western Union Corp., which continues in the outdated business of telegrams long after other forms of communication have bypassed them.    The most difficult task is carving out time for the big project. Easier said than done, of course. But doing it has made a big difference for many companies.    For example, Basler Electric Co., a closely held company in Highland, Ill., found that a division selling electrical relays to utilities was drowning in paper work. &quot;It was a full-time effort doing the marketing mailings to 15,000 potential customers,&quot; says Malcolm Swanson, the division's general manager.    So three years ago Basler handed over the work to an outside firm, ADH Sales Support Inc. of Edison, N.J. &quot;Now we have more time to introduce new products such as a new protective relay we've just introduced that makes us competitive with General Electric and Westinghouse,&quot; says Mr. Basler. &quot;We introduced the unit last February, and because of ADH mailings, we've already sold more than 300 units.&quot;    When a company does innovate, its customers often benefit as much or more. &quot;The new computer system of Business Card Service saves us four hours a day in checking our own files,&quot; says Bonnie Gitzen, an office services supervisor for Minnesota Mining andamp; Manufacturing Co. in St. Paul, Minn., which places 14,000 orders for business cards a year with Mr. Marchessault's company.    Now, to order a business card for any of 3M's 86,000 employees, she simply punches in a code to her computer, which interfaces with Business Card Service's mainframe computer. And voila: The business card with the correct name, title, typeface and layout arrive in two to five days from Business Card Service. &quot;It used to take at least two weeks, before the new system, to get the right information and check it at various printing stages,&quot; says Ms. Gitzen. &quot;And now errors are almost nonexistent.&quot;    &quot;It took a while to get out the bugs, and we may have initially lost some business, but it was well worth it,&quot; says Mr. Marchessault.    Sometimes even companies with products that help their customers be innovative have to come up with new ideas themselves. For example, RAM Center Inc., a Red Wing, Minn., maker of robots, got most of its business by visiting factories of potential customers to spot ways to automate production with robots. Robert Cahlander, RAM Center president, wanted to introduce robots into retail settings, but he couldn't figure out how to do it.    &quot;Just visiting any retail store like a supermarket wouldn't have helped us come up with an innovative idea because we wanted to develop something that doesn't exist,&quot; says Mr. Cahlander. &quot;We wracked our brains and finally decided to build a retail store right on the factory floor.&quot; This meant pulling six engineers off the floor and proved costly.    As a result, RAM Center figures it will operate at close to the break-even point in its fiscal year ending Jan. 31, compared with a profit of $800,000 last year. &quot;But we now have a retail store selling compact disks with music that can be run entirely by robotics,&quot; says Mr. Cahlander. &quot;It took some thinking as to how we could be innovative.&quot;    In October, such a robot-run store will open in a shopping center in South Minneapolis. The robot pays for itself in a year by replacing the cashier and manager. Customers pay with credit cards or cash at a machine similar to an automatic teller machine. The robot keeps track of inventory, stocking and reordering.    One way for small business to spur innovation is for one or more managers to shed day-to-day administrative duties and concentrate on stimulating ideas among the work force. That's what Scott Rickert, the president of Nanofilm Corp., a Strongsville, Ohio, maker of protective coatings for eyeglasses, does.    Mr. Rickert walks around the factory during the day, coffee cup in hand, and visits with each of his 14 employees. &quot;Just the other day I helped one technician figure out how to cut costs for a solvent by 15 times by brainstorming with him,&quot; says Mr. Rickert. &quot;Halfway during the day I replace the coffee with water so I don't get buzzed out on caffeine.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
