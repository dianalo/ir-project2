Reagan claimed that by givingmore to the rich and taking away from the poor we were investing in the futureof the U.S. economy. Where did he get such an idea? He got it from the debatesthat were taking place among economists in England in the early 19th century.;   Only 30 years after Adam Smith's &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot; was published in 1776,theorists in economics were taking a pessimistic view of the future ofcapitalism. David Ricardo thought the dynamics of capitalism were such thatthe system would eventually reach a stagnant state, resulting in massunemployment and poverty, unless capital accumulation steadily increased.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  The Letters Page  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  REAGANOMICS LIVES ONSALES TAX HIKE REFLECTS THE THINKING OF 19THCENTURY ENGLISH ECONOMISTS  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  The Letters Page  </MEMO><TEXT>     For capital accumulation to occur, Ricardo claimed, the majority of theeconomic surplus must be placed in the hands of the capitalist class. He cameto this conclusion by making behavioral assumptions about the social classes:;   Laborers were assumed to consume the whole of what they earned and thusshould only receive a subsistence wage. This would put the majority of theeconomic surplus in the hands of the &quot;thrifty&quot; class of capitalists who wouldinvest in the future so as to be rewarded with profits. The result would be ahigher level of capital that would benefit the entire population.;    TheCalifornia Legislature and Gov. Pete Wilson must subscribe to such aphilosophy. How else can they justify the sales tax increase? A recent studyby the Citizens for Tax Justice shows that nationwide the richest 1 percentearn $875,000 or more, and pay 7.6 percent of their income to state and localtaxes, while the poorest 20 percent earn $12,700 or less and pay 13.8 percentin taxes.;    Before the sales tax increase, the figures for California were10.6 percent for the wealthy and 14.1 percent for the poor. The sales taxincrease drastically changes the numbers for the poor, while the rich canexpect only a slight change.;    Currently the federal government receives 76percent of its revenue from income taxes, while state and local governmentsget only 26 percent from income taxes. The cutbacks in federal spending thatoccurred throughout the '80s shifted the burden to the state governments forfunding local projects, and the state's reliance on sales and excise taxeseffectively increased the amount the poor contributed to taxes.;    Returningto Reagan-Ricardo argument, has &quot;soaking the poor&quot; and giving to the richresulted in a brighter economic future? Not really. The U.S. economy is in arecession and the &quot;thrifty&quot; rich are not engaging in investment for futureincreases in productivity. Rather, they are spending the majority of theirincomes on luxury consumption.;    Countries such as Japan and Germany realizethis and continue to export items for the wealthy to consume (automobiles,stereos, etc). This is extracting the economic surplus from the United Statesand putting it in foreign countries.;    If the United States wants to remainan economic power, it should not continue to follow obsolete ideology from19th century England. U.S. manufacturers should make a new commitment to laborthrough increased wages and vacation time (comparable to workers inScandinavian countries and Germany) and provide greater job security, whilethe government (federal, state and local) should solely use progressive incometaxes to fund its spending.;    This would will give U.S. citizens a brighteroutlook on the future of our economy and we would see consumption andinvestment rise while maintaining economic justice.;    -- Jeff Petersen; SanJose; (hbox);    I've never attempted the making of creamy chocolate fudge, orchewy taffy, but before I pay 8 1/2 percent sales tax on candy, I'll dedicatemy life to trying!;    Also, my potatoes fried with their skins will have tosubstitute for my favorite pretzel! They are great.;    If all our sacrificeswere genuinely and beneficially applied where they should be, I'd cooperatefully. But my 5-cent gas tax, promised to be temporary when passed years ago,has not fixed our roads. Where have all my nickels gone? I still drive onlopsided, patched and re-patched roads, and more and more gas taxes are forcedon us.;    California has become a very, very overrated state, wherestrawberries are red but are never really sweet, and tomatoes are tasteless.I'll eat broccoli, but I refuse to pretend I like artichokes, the onevegetable California is able to grow abundantly and let ripen to maturity.;   -- Cecilia H.
