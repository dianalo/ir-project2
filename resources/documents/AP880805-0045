A federal judge on Thursday slapped the auto rental giant withthe fine and required it to pay restitution that brings Hertz'total bill to more than $20 million, after the company pleadedguilty to bilking customers and insurance companies withfraudulently inflated collision repair charges.   Hertz cheated customers out of more than $13 million betweenJan. 1, 1978 and the summer of 1985, when it learned that a federalgrand jury was investigating the company, Andrew J. Maloney, theU.S. attorney in Brooklyn, told a news conference.   Those who paid money to Hertz because of auto-body damage duringthe period may be eligible for a refund ranging from a few dollarsto several thousand dollars, according to assistant U.S. AttorneyJonny J. Frank, who led the investigation.   Maloney said the $6.85 million fine was believed to be thelargest ever imposed in a consumer fraud case.   U.S. District Judge Eugene Nickerson assessed the penalty duringa proceeding in which the company pleaded guilty to mail fraud andagreed to make restitution.   Nickerson said that within the next 15 days Hertz must deposit$13.7 million into a special fund to be disbursed to individualsand insurance companies that were overcharged. Hertz will have toto pay even more if the fund is insufficient, the judge said.   ``Today's action by the United States attorney's office isdeeply disturbing to me and everyone at Hertz,'' Frank Olson,chairman of the company, said in a statement. ``We regret thatimproper practices took place and are fully committed to makingfull refunds of all overcharges.''   John Martin, a lawyer for Hertz, said low-level managers in thecompany had been responsible for the overbilling and top executiveshad been unaware of the practices. Everyone responsible for theproblem has been fired, he said.   The investigation began when a woman fired on another matterfrom a Hertz office in Massachusetts reported the billing practicesto the Insurance Crime Prevention Institute, an organization fundedby the insurance industry.   Maloney and the other officials declined to identify the woman.   In a related state case, New York Attorney General Robert Abramssaid Hertz had agreed to make an additional $2 million inrestitution to some 10,000 customers who paid for repairs betweenJune 1, 1985, and May 31, 1986.   The company consented to the order in an agreement with New Yorkand 40 other states.   In that case, the company admitted no wrongdoing but agreed tomake the refunds. Abrams said that during the period, Hertz charged``prevailing retail prices for repairs'' when the actual repaircost was about 22 percent less.   Frank said that after Hertz learned in 1985 that it was thesubject of a federal grand jury probe, it altered the fine print inits rental contract to show it was charging more for repairs thanit was paying.   This ended the company's criminal activity, but left it open tothe state attorneys general civil action, Frank said.   In the federal case, Hertz admitted using phony damage claims,altered documents and inflated repair bills to charge higher pricesthan it paid to repair automobiles damaged in accidents.   Hertz employed a number of techniques to defraud its customers,prosecutors said.   Without informing its car renters, Hertz sent to customers whowere involved in an accident or to their insurance companies damageappraisals that did not reflect discounts the company receivedbecause it operated large fleets of vehicles.   The company also programmed a computer to produce inflateddamage-repair estimates.   Hertz also prepared appraisals only on the basis of photographsor accident reports to set the billed cost of repairing a damagedcar, Maloney said. Hertz disguised these phony appraisals aslegitimate by forging appraisers signatures.   Maloney said it was not criminal for an automobile rentalcompany to earn a profit on repairs, but said Hertz acted illegallyby failing to inform its customers and by submitting fraudulentdocuments.   Hertz said it now bills only for its actual cost of repairs andhas discontinued the other illegal practices.   Maloney said the case should serve as a warning to othercompanies.   ``We do not believe that the practices are limited to the HertzCorp. Some of these practices were industrywide,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
