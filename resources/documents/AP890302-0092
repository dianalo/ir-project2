A fifth guerrilla escaped, and troops were searching the area,said a military source, speaking on condition of anonymity.   No Israeli troops were injured, an army spokesman said.   The clash occurred about three miles north of theIsraeli-Lebanese border in the western sector of Israel'sself-proclaimed security zone, said the spokesman, who cannot beidentified under military regulations.   ``This was definitely an infiltration attempt,'' he said.   The spokesman said documents found on the bodies of theguerrillas identified them as members of the Democratic Front forthe Liberation of Palestine, a radical Marxist faction of the PLO.   A security source in Lebanon said the clash occurred in theIsraeli-controlled security zone near the Lebanese village of AlJibbayn.   It was the second infiltration attempt attributed to theDemocratic Front since Feb. 23, when Israeli soldiers killed threePalestinian guerrillas in the six to 10-mile-wide buffer zone.Israel created the security zone in 1985 when it pulled the bulk ofits forces out of Lebanon after a three-year occupation.   Israel radio said the guerrillas killed today were armed withSoviet-made Kalashnikov assault guns, grenades and missiles.   Maj. Gen. Yossi Peled, head of the army's Northern Command, saidleaflets were also found in the possession of the guerrillas.   ``The leaflet speaks of carrying out a hostage-taking mission inIsrael,'' Peled said on Israel radio. ``It speaks of military actionto support the political activities of the PLO leadership.''   Earlier today, the Foreign Ministry gave reporters photocopies oftwo Democratic Front identification cards it said belonged to two ofthe three guerrillas killed Feb. 23. A ministry spokesman, who is bytradition not identified, noted that the Democratic Front is a fullmember of the PLO.   Israel has tried to persuade the United States to end a dialogueit began with the PLO after its chief, Yasser Arafat, said inDecember that he recognized Israel's right to exist and renouncedterrorism.   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who maintains the PLO will nevergive up terrorism, said in an interview published Wednesday that theU.S. talks with the PLO are ``useless.''   On Tuesday, U.S. officials met with PLO representatives in Tunis,where the organization has its headquarters, and asked them to putan end to all attempts by its guerrillas to infiltrate Israel.   But the State Department also criticized an Israeli retaliatoryair raid on Tuesday against a Democratic Front post in Lebanonsoutheast of Beirut.   On Wednesday, a State Department spokesman, Charles Redman, saidthe U.S. talks with the PLO will continue despite Israel's pleas.</TEXT></DOC>
