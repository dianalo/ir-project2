They arebeginning to take notice.   No longer do they repeat the old saying: ``Be careful here inBolivia _ you go to sleep with one government and wake up withanother.''   Bolivians today are seeing the longest uninterrupted period ofelected rule in more than two decades, and officials talk of a newBolivia.   ``In Bolivia there is a new nation, in which a new generationhas consolidated democracy with great effort,'' Finance MinisterJuan Cariaga said in an interview.   The country, he added, has ``achieved an important level ofmaturity.''   Since its founding in 1825, the presidency has changed hands 76times _ an average of once every 26 months.   From 1977 to 1982, Bolivia had 10 governments, eight of whichwere led by right-wing military leaders who either seized power ina coup or inherited it from another military ruler.   In 1982, severe economic problems forced the armed forces toallow elections and hand over power to Hernan Siles Zuazo, thecivilian who won the presidency.   He was succeeded after elections in 1985 by Victor PazEstenssoro, 80. Paz Estenssoro's term ends in May 1989, and alreadyBolivians are preparing for that election.   The last time the country enjoyed such a lengthy period ofelected rule was 1952-64, when Paz Estenssoro also was president.   ``The profound economic crisis led the people to remove themilitary, who bear major responsibility for the country's politicaland economic instability,'' said Simon Reyes, executive secretaryof the Bolivian Workers Central and first secretary of theCommunist Party.   Siles Zuazo also was elected in 1980 but prevented from takingoffice by a military coup. When he finally assumed the presidencytwo years later, his left-of-center government inherited a bankrupteconomy and widespread social unrest.   He quickly established authority over the armed forces,discharging officers who participated in de-facto governments andprosecuting some who were involved in cocaine trafficking.   Labor unions, suppressed during military rule, rose up withappeals for wage increases and improved benefits. When theirdemands weren't promptly met, they staged widespread strikes,roadblocks and protest marches.   But despite that unrest, the citizenry rejected the notion ofanother coup.   In the middle of his term, Siles Zuazo was kidnapped by a groupof civilians backed by police and military officers. But thetakeover bid was firmly rejected by labor and political groups andended in failure the same day it began.   With the economy still souring, the governing leftist coalitionagreed to move up elections under pressure from Congress and tradeunions in 1985. Reyes, whose Communist Party participated in thecoalition, said the coalition had feared military intervention.   Paz Estenssoro, in replacing Siles Zuazo, faced widespread laborunrest and a world-record inflation rate of 24,000 percent a year.But he brought with him a reputation as one of South America's mostable elder statesmen and the experience of three previous terms aspresident.   He enacted a series of belt-tightening measures, including acurrency devaluation of 95 percent, a tenfold increase in gasolineprices and the elimination of consumer price supports.   The measures set off a general strike by the unions, but hedeclared a state of siege and called out the troops, who this timebacked his elected government.   Inflation fell to about 10 percent a year, and signs of economicstability have quelled social unrest somewhat.   When asked, most Bolivians say it is a strong, more deliberatecitizenry and not a weakened military that is responsible for thecountry's political renaissance.   ``There has been a learning process, about living in ademocracy,'' said Herbert Muller, an economist and former CentralBank president under Siles Zuazo. ``With the return to democracythere was a realization of the serious of the problems facing thecountry, and of the need to find political solutions throughdialogue.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Thurs PMs June 9</NOTE></DOC>
