Undaunted, Prof. Henry Bent tries a one-liner aboutmeasuring density. Nobody laughs. He explodes a pink balloonfull of hydrogen. Mr. Smith starts jiggling his leg andreading his mail. The professor shoots a fire extinguisherinto the crowd. Mr. Smith shuts his eyes and slumps in hisseat.</LP><TEXT>   Sustaining interest among budding scientists is no easytask nowadays. Mr. Smith, a 20-year-old junior, has alreadyswitched his major from biology to business, forgoing plansto be a biology teacher. &quot;I couldn't study science because Ididn't enjoy it,&quot; he says.   Mr. Smith isn't alone. Comprehensive statistics on thesubject don't exist, but according to a National ScienceFoundation study, some 42% of those who enter collegeprofessing interest in science or engineering careers dropout of the sciences after freshman year, and another 23%defect before graduation.   The dropout problem isn't new. But Robert Watson, thescience foundation's director of undergraduate science,engineering and mathematics education, says that &quot;certainlythe evidence is it's getting worse.&quot; With fewer studentsinterested in science to begin with and a critical shortageof scientists and engineers, the attrition rate could soonrepresent a national crisis.   Frustrated faculty members blame their students. Highschools left them ill-prepared for rigorous college science,the teachers say. Television and video games, meanwhile, gavethem meager technical skills, short attention spans and adistaste for hard work. &quot;They get here and may genuinely beinterested in science, but they don't have the tools to doit,&quot; says Gary Haller, professor of chemical engineering atYale University.   Students, in turn, blame science professors for usingantiquated teaching methods and draconian grading systems.They also complain of dry lectures packed with scores ofincomprehensible formulas and illustrated with confoundingdiagrams. Science students typically put in more work thantheir peers in the humanities or social sciences, and theirlabors are often rewarded with substantially lower grades.   David Weisberg, a junior at Emory University in Atlanta,entered college as a pre-med major, but after dabbling inchemistry, biology and mathematics, he transferred to thebusiness school. &quot;With all that lab work and the time putforth and for as well as I was doing, it wasn't worth it,&quot;Mr. Weisberg says. &quot;It shot me down. I was just miserable.&quot;   Michael Chen entered Yale in 1986 planning to studyscience like his parents and sister, who are doctors, and hisbrother, who is a computer consultant. But then, he tookastrophysics. &quot;It scared the hell out of me,&quot; says Mr. Chen.&quot;I put more work into the weekly problem sets than I did intomidterm and final papers&quot; for other courses.   Mr. Chen switched his major to English and has since takena job in publishing. &quot;In other classes, if you do the work,you'll get an A,&quot; says Mr. Chen. &quot;In science, it just doesn'twork that way.&quot;   &quot;It's an enormous problem,&quot; concedes mathematician UriTriesman of the University of California at Berkeley. &quot;No onewill follow us unless we make an invitational atmosphere.&quot;   Much of the hostility students perceive in science comesfrom the stingy grading. Science professors, notoriouslytight with the A's, commonly grade on a &quot;curve.&quot; For every Aawarded, there must be a certain number of D's, regardless ofmerit. That leads to fierce competition for the good grades.Some students refuse to help others prepare for exams anddisparage high achievers for &quot;breaking the curve.&quot;Competition becomes so fierce that students have been knownto steal or sabotage their classmates' lab experiments.   &quot;It's a great source of pride to science departments thatthey have the lowest grades in the college,&quot; says WilliamColeman, professor of chemistry at Wellesley College and anadvocate of reform. &quot;I don't see why they're proud of that.&quot;   Frightened by low grades, students reject science coursesin favor of history, for example, where an A paper will begiven an A, regardless of how many other A papers aresubmitted.   They also find that they usually don't have to work ashard for that A in history. On top of lectures, sciencestudents must take time-consuming lab courses -- often foronly partial credit, or for no credit at all. At somecolleges, science majors have to take twice as many requiredcourses as students in other disciplines.   Some scientists say today's crisis has its origins in thepost-Sputnik era. Professors had more science enthusiaststhan they could handle in those days, so they devised ways to&quot;weed out&quot; the less serious. They piled work on theirstudents and made them compete for high marks. And with anoversupply of science students, they didn't have to worrywhether their teaching style was inaccessible.   But now that interest in science careers has waned, the&quot;weeding out&quot; system has become perilous. &quot;A lot of peopleare turned off&quot; from sciences, says Katharine Hanson,executive director of the Consortium on Financing HigherEducation. &quot;It's just not worth the battle.&quot; It doesn't helpthat the financial incentives for science careers are lessattractive than those for, say, law or business careers, sheadded.   Some science professors are trying to make their coursesmore appealing. Wellesley's Mr. Coleman, for example, hasbeen having his introductory chemistry students read andwrite more about science's social and political relevance. Hethrew out the grading curve, so students wouldn't competeagainst each other. He also thinks science departmentsnationwide could ease requirements without compromisingrigor. But he admits his views are considered radical by manyof his peers.   Others, trying to fight the lethargy without compromisingthe requirements, become entertainers instead of professors.One organic chemistry professor set his lecture to the tune&quot;America the Beautiful.&quot;   Another entertainer, however, is about ready to close hisact. &quot;I'm going to be a marine drill sergeant -- I'm notgoing to smile until Christmas,&quot; threatens Pitt's Mr. Bent, a40-year teaching veteran.   &quot;We've pulled out all the stops, and we're still notgetting results,&quot; he says, disassembling a toy cannon afterclass. &quot;We're having the worst times of our lives now, andit's getting worse.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
