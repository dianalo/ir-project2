He said high-ranking people, whom he did not identify, wereinvolved in the poaching. He described it as ``economic sabotagewith far-reaching and lasting effects on the posterity, stabilityand success of our country.''   Leakey also challenged George Muhoho, minister of tourism andwildlife, to prove his claim that 22,000 elephants remain in Kenya.   ``We may have less than half that number in reality at thistime,'' said Leakey. ``Until a proper census is carried out, thefigure of 22,000 should be taken with caution.''   Muhoho cited the 22,000 figure Monday when he reported to ameeting of ornithologists that in the last four months poachers hadkilled 92 elephants in several game parks, The Standard andNairobi's other two English-language papers, Kenya Times and DailyNation, reported Tuesday.   Studies by the U.N. Environmental Program show that in the last15 years, elephant populations have dropped 85 percent in Kenya andthat herds in Tanzania and Uganda have been similarly depleted.   An aerial survey in February of the vast Tsavo National Park insoutheastern Kenya found 5,363 elephants, down from an estimated35,000 in that park alone in 1974.   An all-time high ivory price is fueling the slaughter, accordingto experts who say poaching will not abate until the illegal tradeis halted.   Muhoho said the government was trying to combat the animalslaughter by ``increasing manpower, training and equipmentavailable to rangers.''   But Leakey said rangers were equipped with inadequate weaponsagainst well-armed poachers and were seriously hindered byimpassable roads, broken-down vehicles and inadequate fuel supplies.   ``The minister and his officers are urged to do more than givelip service to the growing crisis,'' said Leakey, brother ofKenya's only white parliamentarian, Philip Leakey, and son of notedpaleontologists Louis and Mary Leakey.</TEXT></DOC>
