(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A British communications satellite isto be launched Sunday on the first commercial American space rocket,the rocket's manufacturer said Friday.   The satellite, Marcopolo 1, is to be sent into space at 6:50 p.m.by a three-stage Delta booster, McDonnell Douglas officials said.   Orbiting 22,300 miles up, Marcopolo 1 is the first of twosatellites designed to transmit pay-TV programs direct to Britishhomes equipped with a 12-inch-diameter antenna.   The launch will mark a milestone in a commercial space programstarted when the National Aeronautics and Space Administration wastold by then-President Reagan to stop launching commercial payloadsafter the space shuttle Challenger exploded in 1986. Reagan said thejob should be done by private industry.   Three U.S. companies took up the goal in earnest; the McDonnellDouglas Delta is the first to the launch pad. Martin Marietta hasscheduled a commercial launch with its Titan rocket later this year,and General Dynamics' Atlas is to make its debut next year.   All three rockets are upgraded versions of boosters that NASA andthe Air Force have used for several years.   British Satellite Broadcasting Ltd. selected Hughes Aircraft Co.in 1987 to build the two Marcopolo satellites under a $300 millioncontract.   McDonnell Douglas is charging Hughes $50 million for each of thetwo launches. Hughes must verify that the satellites are in orbitand working before BSB accepts them.</TEXT></DOC>
