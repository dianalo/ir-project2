The base case data-baseis established from some operating points of the seasonal average ofdaily demand curve. Real-time basis equation derivation is performed,and the solution procedure is described. An approximate solution canbe obtained very quickly by the proposed method. An example system istested to show the computation capability of the proposed method. Thecomputation time of this method is much shorter, and the solution accuracyis good, compared to other adopted methods. This method is very suitablefor real-time economic dispatch in power system operation.</TEXT></DOC>
