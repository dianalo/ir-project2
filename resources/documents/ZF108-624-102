 While providingthe reader with as much information as possible is one of yourresponsibilities, it is also your responsibility to ensure the article'saccuracy and make the distinction between facts and rumors clear to thereader.andM;While the title and body of your article, &quot;New Macs may prompt price cuts,&quot;attempt to separate conjecture from fact, the accompanying graphic on thecover can be easily interpreted by the casual reader as factual.andM;What must owners of a Macintosh SE or Plus think after seeing a blackdinosaur next to the model they just purchased?andP;  Will they interpret thatsymbol as an indication that Apple will not support those models anymore orthat their Macintosh will no longer meet their existing needs?andM;The computer industry isn't unique regarding new product speculation;however, history has shown that Apple may wait until the last possible momentto position a new product by price or model configuration.andP;  Apple also hasdelayed product announcements.andP;  This behavior must be taken into account whenwriting articles of this nature.andM;I have come to expect and accept leaks of information about pending products.andO;Yes, it may have a negative impact on current sales, but it can also provideinformation about what will not be included in a new product, positivelyaffecting a current quote.andP;  The impact on the industry, both positive andnegative, must be carefully weighed and analyzed before committing anythingto paper.andM;P.S.andP;  Just received the latest MacWEEK this morning.andP;  Thanks for ruiningLaserWriter sales also.andM;Scott Prakken, account representativeandM;Sun Computers Inc.San DiegoandM;There's more to screen savers than meets the eyeandM;In response to the letter from Gregory Johnson and Kevin McDonald (MacWEEK,June 12), I must say that I appreciate MacWEEK's reviews of screen savers.andO;For people who work in classified environments and use screen savers assecurity devices, your reviews and update information are particularlyhelpful.andP;  Screen savers may seem like toys -- they do provide a bit of fun --but they're also useful security tools.andM;Sheri BarnesandM;Falls Church, Va.andM;Configuration change can rev up Outbound speedsandM;On behalf of Outbound Systems Inc., I'd like to thank you for your recentreview (MacWEEK, June 19) of our Macintosh-compatible Outbound Laptopcomputer.andP;  However, your article stated that no mouse is supplied with thestandard laptop system, when in reality we are bundling a mouse with theOutbound Laptop through Aug.andP;  31.andP;  After that date, we will offer mice as anoption for $129 each.andM;In regard to the &quot;performance drop&quot; in the Outbound when docked to the hostMacintosh, this phenomenon can change depending upon the configuration ofmemory in the two systems.andP;  By reallocating memory from the Macintosh to theOutbound, performance can be improved considerably.andP;  Outbound-certifieddealers are equipped to move memory to optimize performance of the dockedsystem.andM;I would also like to update the benchmark results in the review.andP;  Afterdiscussing the results with the reviewer, we discovered that the tests wereperformed while the power-saving CPU Sleep feature was enabled.andP;  When thefeature was disabled, performance improved drastically.andP;  For example, oneEarthPlot operation took 114 seconds with CPU Sleep enabled and only 12seconds with the feature disabled.andM;Douglas Swartz, CEOandM;Outbound Systems Inc.andM;Boulder, Colo.andM;Editors note: See MacInTouch, Page 58, for more information on the newbenchmarks.andM;Blueprint an alternate 2-D draft choice for CAD usersandM;MacWEEK's June 12 story &quot;Generic CADD boasts drafting features, drawing-appease of use&quot; states that &quot;at $595, Generic CADD is $300 less than its closestcompetitor, Claris CAD 2.0.&quot; We at Graphsoft would like to point out thatBlueprint, our 2-D CAD competitor to Claris CAD, costs $295.andP;  Blueprint hasall the features traditionally associated with pro-fessional 2-D CAD,including associative auto-dimensioning, color, a built-in DXF (DrawingInterchange Format) translator, layering, a hierarchical symbol library,advanced object editing and more.andM;Diane ReynoldsandM;Graphsoft Inc.andM;Ellicott City, Md.andM;Macintosh users take a walk on the esoteric sideandM;I have read with a great deal of interest all the groaning and complainingabout the Macintosh being overpriced.andP;  For whatever reason, there will alwaysbe those who will choose price over quality, but this segment of the marketis not where the Mac belongs.andP;  The selling of the Mac is an appeal to themore esoteric side of people.andP;  You have to sell quality, reliability and thewhole Mac concept.andP;  The Mac is more than the sum of its parts.andM;Mark InfangerandM;Classic Configurations Inc.andM;HoustonandM;SPSS stands by claim  of 'easy' user interfaceandM;We at SPSS feel that most aspects of the user interface that make SPSS 4.0easy to use for experts and novices alike were overlooked in the June 5comparative review &quot;Turning raw data into statistics.&quot;andM;The review states that &quot;the command line is the only way to accomplish mosttasks in SPSS,&quot; and notes that only Systat offers menus as an alternative tothe command-line interface.andP;  SPSS for the Macintosh offers a complete menusystem and a context-sensitive command generator that make it simple to buildcomplex analyses without typing or memorizing syntax.andP;  In fact, there areonly two operations that require typing: building macros and buildingstatistical procedures using the Matrix procedure (matrix algebra).andP;  SPSSeven offers a Statistical Glossary, which provides definitions of statisticalterms.andM;The reviewer's other major complaint about SPSS for the Mac is that there isno way to enter data directly.andP;  SPSS for the Macintosh does provide fordirect data entry into SPSS.andP;  We recommend using a spreadsheet or databasepackage, however, simply because most users have those types of programsresident and prefer them for data entry.andP;  SPSS for the Macintosh supportsSYLK file format as well as SPSS system files downloaded from otherplatforms, including SPSS portable files.andM;Elan Long, product managerandM;SPSS Inc.andM;ChicagoandM;Writer Linda Custer replies: We may simply have a semantic difference ofopinion here.andP;  You believe I overlooked SPSS' &quot;complete menu system.&quot; I didcomment that the only way to &quot;accomplish most tasks&quot; is through the commandline.andP;  True, saving files and running macros are menu functions; however, nodata-analysis commands appear in menus.andP;  Moreover, data analysis is performedonly when a macro file is run or a command has been typed at a prompt(whether from the keyboard or the command generator) and then executed.andP;  Imentioned later in the article that &quot;SPSS' command generator and help systemmake command construction easy.&quot;andM;In regard to SPSS' data-entry facilities, I was specific in commenting thatthe creation of spreadsheetlike tables of data was not supported.andP;  SPSSoffers a text editor in the input window that can be used to type or paste innumbers between DATA commands, but no SPSS utilities assist the user in&quot;creating 2-D tables in which rows represent cases and columns representvariables.&quot;andM;Authors of utilities defend Now Utilities packageandM;Your review of Now Utilities in the June 12 issue overlooked one component ofNow Utilities: MemorySetter.andP;  MemorySetter allows a person using MultiFinderto temporarily adjust an application's memory partition as the application isbeing launched.andM;I developed MemorySetter specifically for Now Utilities, and it offers uniquefeatures not found in any other product that I know of in the Macintoshmarketplace.andM;Michael PierceandM;San Jose, Calif.andM;As the author of StartUp Manager (Now Utilities' INIT manager), I felt thereview missed the point of the product.andM;Now Utilities isn't intended to increase the capabilities of its (formerlyshareware) components, but to make its components reliable and compatible, togive them consistent user interfaces, and to provide competent, easilyavailable technical support.andM;I must respond to the complaint that StartUp Manager's user interface is&quot;similar to INITPicker.&quot; How many ways are there to give a user control overa set of things, especially when you want to comply with the Macuser-interface guidelines?andP;  It comes down to a scrolling list and somebuttons.andM;As to &quot;a pale imitation [of INITPicker],&quot; StartUp Manager provides thecapability to specify multiple named configurations for INITs and to easilychoose which one you want, either at start-up or through the Control Panel,via a pop-up menu.andP;  We had this capability before INITPicker did, and in myopinion we provide a better user interface for it.andM;StartUp Manager reorders INITs by renaming them.andP;  This is the methodrecommended for people who don't have INIT managers.andP;  It is a much lessintrusive way of controlling INITs than the alternative, which is to &quot;steal&quot;control of the INITs from the system software.andP;  StartUp Manager runs briefly,renames the INITs, and it's gone.andP;  It is not present as the INITs themselvesare run.andP;  This method is a &quot;light touch.&quot; It is less likely to cause bugs,less likely to cause compatibility problems and was (we hoped) more likely tobe compatible with System 7.0.andM;Michael TrigoboffandM;MLT Software Inc.andM;Portland, Ore.andM;Apple wears the white hat in showdown with gray marketersandM;Hooray for Apple!andP;  Your June 26 article regarding Apple's recent crackdown ongray marketers is music to our ears.andP;  Even in remote areas like Wyoming, theimpact of transshipping has been felt.andP;  Too often, this type of marketingforces honest Apple dealers to sell by price rather than support.andP;  It'srefreshing to see Apple looking out for the good guys.andM;Jeff Buckallew and Randy McDonaldandM;Team Electronics, a MicroAge affiliateandM;Casper, Wyo.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
