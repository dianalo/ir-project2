The 392-18 vote came as House Appropriations subcommitteescompleted drafting Treasury and Justice Department bills thatwould provide significant increases for the Internal RevenueService and federal prisons but would pare back the Bushadministration's plans to expand the Federal Bureau ofInvestigation.</LP><TEXT>   Justice Department spending would grow almost 9% to about$9.3 billion in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, but much ofthe increase would reflect the added costs of operating newfederal prisons built in recent years. By comparison, theproposed appropriations for the FBI would be far short of thefigure needed to fulfill the administration's goal of adding1,500 new positions. Though some program increases areexpected, the panel specifically rejected the bureau'srequest to beef up classified treaty-verification operations.   The Justice Department budget is part of a larger $21.5billion bill covering Commerce and State Departmentoperations as well. The diverse interests make thelegislation one of the most eclectic to face Congress eachyear, and it has become a major battleground this year as theadministration has proposed popular initiatives that requireoffsetting cuts under new spending rules incorporated in lastOctober's deficit pact.   The Justice Department figures approved yesterday by aHouse subcommittee represent a cut of between $300 millionand $400 million from the administration's budget. But thesubcommittee preserved costly Economic DevelopmentAdministration and small business credit programs that weretargeted by the White House.   Lawmakers provided an estimated $63 million -- a 28%increase -- for advanced techonology programs in the CommerceDepartment, but the panel refused to provide a $30.8 millionincrease in spending sought by the National Oceanic andAtmospheric Administration to study global climate change.   The bill would nearly triple current appropriations forNOAA polar satellite operations, as requested by theadministration. But spending for the troubled geostationarysatellite program would be frozen at current levels, and theNational Weather Service's budget request for itsearly-warning NEXRAD radar system would be cut byapproximately $31 million.   The panel's revamped State Department budget would providesignificant increases for U.S. contributions to the UnitedNations. In a step sure to provoke debate, lawmakers used thecurrent budget crisis as an opportunity to cut off funds forgovernment-sponsored televisions broadcasts aimed at Cuba.The broadcasts, called TV Marti after a famed Cubannationalist, have been modeled on the more longstanding --but less costly -- Radio Marti program, which would becontinued.   The proposed increase in funds for the IRS is part of aseparate, $19.5 billion spending bill covering both theTreasury Department and subsidies to the Postal Service. Anestimated $6.7 billion would be provided for IRS operations,a 9.7% increase over current spending.   To stay within the new budget caps, the measure woulddelay expenditure of about $417 million requested by the IRSfor new computers. Within postal accounts, new rates chargedby the Service work to force up the cost of subsidies paid toprotect nonprofit mailings, and federal payments would growto $649 million, or 37% above the current year.   The military construction bill approved yesterday by theHouse would provide $758.6 million for base closings soughtby the Pentagon. But the measure also is a vehicle forinfluential lawmakers to grab funds for home state projects.Money cut from overseas projects effectively would beredistributed within the U.S., including some to thedistricts of Speaker Thomas Foley and influential Housechairmen.   U.S. contributions to the so-called NATO infrastructureaccount, a pool of funds for construction at NATO bases,would be cut $33.9 million from current levels, for example.By comparison, $30 million would be provided for a militaryhospital project in the Florida district of Foreign AffairsCommittee Chairman Dante Fascell, and another $30.2 millionwould be provided for a Marine and Army reserve facility inthe Pennsylvania district of Rep. John Murtha, chairman ofthe House defense appropriations subcommittee.</TEXT></DOC>
