The lawyer, Paul Muite, said Moi criticized some of his viewsduring their wide-ranging 40-minute discussion at the president'sofficial residence, but added that overall the meeting was cordial.   Muite said Moi told him he was free to return to work.   The talks come one day after Muite issued a statement callingfor the release of political detainees. He also denied involvementin recent politically inspired riots in which at least 28 peopledied.   Moi on Sunday accused Muite of fomenting the violence and urgedhim to come out of hiding and apologize in person.   Muite went underground July 5, one day after two of his clients,former Cabinet ministers Charles Rubia and Kenneth Matiba, weredetained under security statutes that allow them to be heldindefinitely without charge.   The politicians had been at the forefront of the campaign tolegalize opposition parties.   Following the arrest of Rubia and Matiba, 15 other people linkedto the democracy campaign were arrested.   Muite said Moi's only mention of the political detainees was tosay ``that he does not take any pleasure in detaining people.''   ``I thought that was very positive,'' Muite told The AssociatedPress in a telephone interview.   Moi has come under criticism at home and abroad for thedetentions of the pro-democracy activists and his government'shandling of the recent riots in Nairobi and other cities.   More than 1,400 people were charged in connection with the July7-10 riots in which mobs of stone-throwing youths clashed withpolice, stores were looted and vehicles burned.   The rioting broke out and spread after police used tear gas andgunfire to disperse a pro-democracy rally in Nairobi.   The rally had been proposed by Matiba and Rubia, the leaders ofa loose alliance of prominent Kenyans who accused the government ofwidespread corruption and election rigging and called for politicalchange.   Kenya banned its last opposition party in 1969. Kenya became aone-party state by law in 1982.   Moi has rejected calls for political pluralism, claiming itcould lead to tribal-based parties and possibly warfare.</TEXT></DOC>
