Mr. Turner was charged last month with five bribery counts, but according to a spokeswoman for Hong Kong's independent Commission Against Corruption, three of the charges were dropped in exchange for the guilty plea. In an appearance before Judge Owen Corcoran, Mr. Turner pleaded guilty to accepting 888,000 Hong Kong dollars (US$113,768) in July 1981 from George Tan, chairman of the bankrupt Carrian Group, in exchange for using his position with Barclays Asia to arrange an HK$100 million loan for Carrian Holdings Ltd.    Mr. Turner also pleaded guilty to accepting HK$300,000 from businessman Victor Hwang in March 1982 in return for arranging an HK$80 million loan for Mr. Hwang's Tri-View Ltd.    At the time the offenses took place, Barclays Asia was the local merchant banking arm of Barclays Bank PLC of Britain. Barclays in London said Barclays Asia has been a non-operating unit for &quot;a number of years.&quot;    Mr. Turner faces a maximum penalty of seven years in prison and an HK$500,000 fine on each charge. The former banker is in jail awaiting sentencing, which is scheduled for Friday. </TEXT></DOC>
