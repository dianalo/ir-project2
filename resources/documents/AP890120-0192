Britain and the United States initially refused to attend theconference. But after reforms initiated by Soviet President MikhailGorbachev, they said this month that they agreed in principle to go.   Mrs. Thatcher listed the conditions in a written reply to alegislator's question in the House of Commons. Other conditionsincluded:   _ Implementation of promised changes in Soviet criminal law, withthe abolition or amendment of political and religious articles.   _ Effective guarantees of free speech, freedom of religion,freedom to emigrate and genuine independence of the courts.   _ A guarantee that the conference would be run on exactly similarlines to East-West meetings held in the West.   _ Maintenance of existing improvements.   ``All of this assumes that nothing has happened in the meantimeto seriously undermine the greatly improved state of East-Westrelations,'' Mrs. Thatcher added.</TEXT></DOC>
