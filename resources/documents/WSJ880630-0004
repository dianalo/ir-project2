In active trading on European spot markets, crudes dropped between 25 cents and 30 cents, with the Brent crude falling below $15 a barrel. One cargo sold at $14.82, the lowest price in three months, according to Dow Jones International Petroleum Report. And at least one cargo of Middle East crude was sold in Europe at $1.50 a barrel below Brent prices, a major oil company trader said.    Gasoline, however, ran counter to crude. The strong U.S. gasoline market drew still more bullish signals from this week's report by the American Petroleum Institute of huge drawdowns in motor fuel inventories. In heavy trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, August-delivery gasoline closed at 49.29 cents a gallon, up fractionally from 49.12 cents the preceding day.    Gasoline firmed crude prices slightly, but only temporarily, in the volatile futures markets. West Texas Intermediate crude, which surged initially, fell sharply yesterday afternoon under a wave of selling to close at $15.43, down 35 cents a barrel. Nearly 111,000 contracts were traded vs. the average volume of 70,000.    &quot;Gasoline was the only thing supporting this market,&quot; said Eric Bolling, a trader with Edge Trading Corp. But that wasn't enough to overcome the impact in the crude market on a report from Abu Dhabi, chief member of the United Arab Emirates, that the supreme petroleum council has ordered Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. to expand output by some 25%. &quot;There was a tremendous selloff (in the crude market) based on the word from Abu Dhabi,&quot; Mr. Bolling said.    Traders interpreted the UAE move as a further flaunting of Abu Dhabi's previous rejection of the production quota assigned it by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. And it added to speculation that some other OPEC producers, including kingpin Saudi Arabia, might increase their output.    Total OPEC output already is generally considered to be 500,000 barrels a day above market requirements for the seasonally weak third quarter. &quot;OPEC production is going to remain 18.5 million barrels a day or higher,&quot; said Vahan Zanoyan, senior director of Washington-based Petroleum Finance Co. &quot;I don't see any country in any way prepared to reduce production.&quot;    In other U.S. pricing developments, Phillips Petroleum Co., Marathon Petroleum Corp., Conoco Inc., Sun Co. and others reduced their field postings for West Texas Intermediate crude by 50 cents a barrel to $15.25. But Jack W. Wilkinson, Sun's chief economist, expects crude prices to firm later this year when petroleum demand increases seasonally. &quot;Within three or four weeks, we may start to see the pressure come off crude,&quot; he said.    In other commodity markets yesterday:   COFFEE: Futures prices fell on prospects of substantial supplies in a period of seasonally slow demand. Expectation of mild weather in Brazilian coffee-growing areas through the weekend was also a depressant. Exporting countries have shipped two million bags less than quotas called for from October through March and export quotas for the April-September period will be larger. Thus, in the absence of adverse Brazilian weather to provide support, rising supplies are causing prices to weaken, an analyst said.    SUGAR: Futures prices ended mixed after recovering from early declines influenced by the plunge in soybean prices. While most sugar futures ended lower, prices were at the day's highs. Sugar traders disengaged from the Midwest drought developments and focused on sugar's own increasingly bullish fundamental factors, namely tighter world supplies at a time of increasing demand, analysts said.    PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices ended lower, but were up from the day's lows. The big slump of the soybean market and depressed crude oil prices -- two anti-inflationary developments -- and a stronger dollar combined to depress precious metals prices, analysts said. The higher dollar also has prompted some Japanese and Middle Eastern selling of precious metals, according to one analyst. At one point, August gold fell below what had been regarded as a key support level of $433 an ounce, but it subsequently recovered to above that price.    COPPER: Prices of all contracts fell, except for July, but above the day's lows. According to one analyst, statistics released by the American Bureau of Metal Statistics, a private statistical organization, provided support for the market. The figures showed that, as of the end of May, consumption in the U.S. for copper was improving, while inventories world-wide as of the end of April were lower.    COTTON: Futures prices fell the daily permissible limit of two cents a pound in all contracts. Traders sold on concern that rains in the Midwest grain and soybean-growing areas might move into cotton-growing regions that have been experiencing dry weather, such as the Mississippi Delta and Texas, analysts said. Rains would alleviate the possibility of stress damage to the cotton crop, they said. </TEXT></DOC>
