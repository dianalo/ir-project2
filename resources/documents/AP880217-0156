Hermann Scheer, disarmament expert for the opposition SocialDemocrats, said Chancellor Helmut Kohl should respond to the earlySoviet missile reductions by dismantling West Germany's 72 Pershing1A missiles.   ``Such a reaction would be equal to developing trust indisarmament which the leadership in East Berlin has been workingtoward with the Soviets,'' Scheer, speaking on behalf of the party,told reporters.   East Germany's state-run news agency, ADN, reported Tuesday thatthe Soviet Union had dismantled SS-12 nuclear missiles in Waren, anEast German site about 90 miles northwest of Berlin.   The SS-12s are included in a U.S.-Soviet agreement to eliminatethe superpowers' medium- and shorter-range missiles.   Kohl announced before the superpower pact was signed that WestGermany would scrap its Pershing 1A missiles as part of a newtreaty. The Pershing 1A missiles are owned by West Germany, but theUnited States controls the rockets' nuclear warheads.   On Wednesday, East German newspapers printed photos ofdismantled missiles and hailed the Soviet preparations for removingthe SS-12s before the treaty is ratified.   ``Soviet missile troops preparing withdrawal from (EastGermany),'' the Communist party's official newspaper New Germanysaid in a banner headline.   President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev signedthe treaty in Washington last December. The agreement stipulatesthat the Soviets' shorter-range missiles in East Germany and inCzechoslovakia are to be removed within 18 months and medium-rangeU.S. and Soviet missiles within three years.   Three Senate committees are debating the treaty and ratificationmay come during the summer. The Supreme Soviet, the Soviet Union'sparliament, is expected to approve the accord.   In Washington, the State Department had no immediate reaction tothe report. But a U.S. official who demanded anonymity said theSoviets were free to remove their missiles before the treaty takeseffect.   The official said U.S. inspectors will go to East Germany andall other Soviet missile sites to verify compliance with the treatyif it is ratified.   ADN did not say how many missiles had been dismantled or whenthey would be returned to the Soviet Union, only that Sovietsoldiers ``are making the last preparations to return their SS-12rockets.   ``With this step we can make an important contribution towarddisarmament even before the treaty between the United States andthe Soviet Union is ratified,'' ADN wrote.   East German leader Erich Honecker said in January that Sovietintermediate-range rockets based in his country could be removedahead of schedule, but at the time gave no specific timetable.   According to figures released after the treaty was signed, 22rockets, 12 launchers, nine transport vehicles and seven practicemissiles were stationed at Waren, which has the largest numbers ofSS-12s in East Germany. There are three other SS-12 sites in thecountry.   The Soviet Union also has shorter-range SS-23 nuclear missilesbased in East Germany.</TEXT></DOC>
