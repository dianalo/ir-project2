Eventually, the space agency said, it may launch as many as nine spacecraft a year by throwaway rockets. That represents a sharp change for an agency that once touted the space shuttle as the nation's &quot;space truck&quot; -- the only vehicle needed to haul satellites and other payloads into space.    &quot;The Challenger accident pointed out that we had all our eggs in one basket,&quot; said one NASA official. &quot;We were concentrating on a single launch source.&quot;    James Fletcher, NASA's administrator, agreed that the agency's moves were an effort to correct problems laid bare by the Jan. 28, 1986, accident and to reduce the backlog of space-science payloads grounded by the crash.    &quot;A major objective of this plan is to accelerate the deployment of the nation's backlog of space-science missions,&quot; he said. Many space scientists have become increasingly concerned that their satellites and experiments would be grounded indefinitely. After the Challenger accident, their payloads were bumped off the shuttle schedule to make way for national security and &quot;shuttle-unique&quot; payloads.    For several months, Congress and space-agency advisory committees have been urging NASA to supplement the shuttle with a &quot;mixed fleet&quot; of unmanned rockets of various sizes. A congressional space specialist called the NASA announcement Friday &quot;a good sign.&quot;    The space agency doesn't plan to buy the new rockets directly. Instead, it will contract with private companies for &quot;launch services&quot; -- which include the rocket, the software and engineering and logistical work. The agency said it is following this approach to comply with a Reagan administration policy of encouraging the growth of the fledgling commercial launch business whenever possible.    The agency said it would acquire the services on a noncompetitive basis for the first five spacecraft to be launched, &quot;in order to make the best match&quot; between the rockets available and the already designed payloads. After that, it said, the services would be procured competitively.    The agency didn't say how much additional money it would need to buy the launch services; the subject is currently &quot;under review,&quot; according to one official. Medium-size Delta rockets cost about $30 million to $40 million each, while the larger Atlas Centaur and Titan rockets cost from $120 million to $200 million each, officials said.    For the immediate future, the U.S. companies with the best chance of benefiting from the NASA policy include: McDonnell Douglas Corp., manufacturer of the Delta rocket; General Dynamics Corp., manufacturer of the Atlas-Centaur; and Martin Marietta Corp., manufacturer of the Titan. </TEXT></DOC>
