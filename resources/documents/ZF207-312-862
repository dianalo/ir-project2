 TELECONNECT believes this&quot;take-off&quot; is so important we are devoting special (and additional) pages toan expanded coverage of the ICA Show.andM;This is the third &quot;takeoff&quot; in telecom since Carterfone in the summer of1968.andP;  At that time all PBXs offered in the US were step-by-step monsters.andO;Within five years of Carterfone, we had three new PBX generations.andP;  Thathectic technological takeoff -- the first -- took place from the end of the1960s to the mid-1970s.andM;Then we had a five-year hiatus, when the industry tried to digest thetechnology and tried to figure out how to distribute it.andP;  The words &quot;PriceWar&quot; were first heard at the end of the 1970s.andM;The 1980s started with another explosion of new telecom peripheral technologywhich went through the mid-1980s, when we ran up against two walls --distribution and price.andM;The 1980s are ending and the 1990s are beginning on the crest of the biggesttechnological explosion ever in telecom.andP;  Two things are different about thisboom:andM;1.andP;  Major breakthroughs in technology in the past few years have dropped theprice of new telecom technology.andP;  There are two reasons for thesebreakthroughts -- the microprocessor revolution and the &quot;digital&quot; revolution.andM;The resulting price drops promise to make mass markets of huge amounts of newtelecom technology.andP;  Once happy with a 1A2 key system, the small businessmannow knows about and is willing to splurge on new telecom gadgetry from faxmachines to local area networks, from auto attendants to voice mail, fromdata communications to data networks.andP;  .  .and soon video-conferencing andsub-rate (also called &quot;fractional&quot;) T-1.andP;  .  .And, in the not too distantfuture, the ISDN.andM;The biggest skeptics of them all -- the reporters at TELECONNECT -- nowbelieve the ISDN makes sense.andP;  There is a future for it and it will prevail.andM;2.andP;  The nation's long distance carriers have spent the last eight yearstransforming themselves.andP;  The metamorphosis that has occurred at MCI, ATandamp;Tand US Sprint is nothing but startling.andM;Teh focus on internal improvement (i.e.andP;  you didn't see it; you saw no newservices) is now over.andP;  Their focus is now shifting to the end user.andP;  Thereare vast gains now available for the savvy end-user.andM;All three networks are virtually complete in their shift over to CommonChannel Signaling System 7.andP;  This means faster call setup and teardown times.andO;If you're close to a long distance office or trunked directly into one,making a long distance call today is almost as fast as if you were callinglocally on the same digital central office.andM;Within months, all three long distance companies will offer their end userscalling number identification.andP;  There won't be a user company in the 1990s --large or small -- that won't demand the number of who's calling them.andM;One ICA member told Harry he expected he could cut each of his in-bound 800calls by an average of 20 seconds if he had those inbound calling numbers.andO;He figured this savings would save his company millions on In-WATS lines, aswell as substantially improve the quality of service he was delivering hiscustomers.andM;In all this telecom euphoria, three problems remain:andM;1.andP;  How to get it all distributed.andP;  There is an acute shortage of&quot;applications-educated&quot; distribution in telecom.andP;  Being under-educated in theways companies use telecom, salespeople in telecom too often clinch theirtelecom sales with deep discounting.andP;  This destroys their employers' abilityto survive long-term.andM;Fortunately, some of the new telecom stuff is so &quot;exciting&quot; it will literally&quot;walk off the shelves.&quot;andP;  Even more fortunately, much of the newer stuff, e.g.andO;smaller ACDs, voice processing and high-speed customer data inquiry networks-- is being bought by sales and marketing buyers who more quickly recognizethe competitive edge-enhancing value of the new telecom stuff, and makefaster decisions than traditional telecom managers.andM;2.andP;  How to get it past &quot;The Final Mile.&quot;andP;  The Bell Operating Companies remaina major hurdle.andP;  Most continue to lag every major technological advance inthe industry (and derive perverse pride from being backward).andM;However, what they lack in technology innovation, they more than make up inpricing innovation.andP;  Their rates escalate, while the price of the equipmentthey buy falls!andP;  Fortunately, there are alternatives.andP;  Bypass by fiber andmicrowave systems grows daily more prevalent and more economical.andM;3.andP;  How to get users educated.andP;  To understand the new telecom technology --e.g.andP;  network management and ISDN -- requires far more than old-fashionedtelecommunications knowledge.andM;People with telecom and DP knowledge are an unbelievably scarce commodity.andO;Despite the apparent technical similarity of the fields, they'resignificantly different.andP;  ATandamp;T has lost billions trying to learn about DP.andO;IBM has lost millions trying to learn about telecom.andM;Most large telecom users are scared to death of the technology of ISDN.andP;  As aresult, most major users at ICA poked fun at ISDN.andP;  Favorite ICA question:&quot;What does ISDN stand for?&quot;andP;  Answer: &quot;I Still Don' Know.&quot;andM;Yet, ISDN is clearly here.andP;  It will determine the future of our industry.andO;And it should.andP;  ISDN has major advantages.andP;  We remain a convert.andM;Burning Question Answered: We've often lost a good night's sleep wonderingexactly what Xiox's Traffic Engineering Series chief benefits were?andP;  Westopped by their booth.andP;  They set our collective minds at ease.andM;The Series is an interactive decision support tool that integrates with theirCall Accounting General Business software.andP;  The module works in combinationwith the call accounting data from the phone system to provide:andM;* Summaries of call traffic to various destinations;andM;* Detailed analysis of trunk performance;andM;* Evaluation of installed automatic route selection patterns;andM;* Identification of potential tie line and FX candidates;andM;* Cost effective selection among long distance carriers;andM;* Performance of least cost single-node network design;andM;* Exploration of a wide range of &quot;What if&quot; scenarios;andM;* Analysis of trunk member performance;andM;* &quot;Red Flag&quot; reports identifying trunk utilization and cost savingsopportunities;andM;* And a bunch of &quot;Hot Topic&quot; reports.andM;Now we can rest easy.andM;Major ICA Technology Trends.andP;  Here are the major technology trends at ICA.andO;(More about them through this special ICA Section.)andM;1.andP;  Digital circuits down in price.andP;  ATandamp;T, MCI and US Sprint have allannounced they have or will reduce their switched 56 Kbps circuits down tothe price of a voice call.andM;The price reduction is an incredible 75%-plus.andP;  (Remember, you can only go to100% and then it's free.)andM;2.andP;  Video conferencing down in price and up in quality.andP;  With the reductionin price of digital circuits and the new video-conferencing equipment, youcan now have a decent-quality, long distance video conference for less than$20 an hour!andM;And we mean decent-quality.andP;  All of us watched and participated invideo-conferences to San Francisco, Chicago, Boston and Atlanta.andP;  Every longdistance carrier -- ATandamp;T, MCI and Sprint -- had live and continuing videoconferences running throughout ICA.andP;  They were fabulous.andM;3.andP;  Digial voice is coming down in price.andP;  Once, you needed 64 kilobits asecond to sample analog voice.andP;  Now, you can do it in eight kilobits(Newbridge is doing it).andP;  Every mathematician in the US now must spend theirnights figuring new algorithms to reduce the number of bits you need toencode voice and still make it recognizable.andM;One day, each phone will have a thumbwheel, like a volume control.andP;  Thethumbwheel will control the number of bits your conversation is presentlybeing encoded.andP;  By dropping the encoding, you can drop the price of the call,or vice versa.andM;4.andP;  ANI is finally here, or soon will be.andP;  There are enormous advantages inknowing the number of the person who called you.andP;  The three long distancecarriers -- MCI, ATandamp;T and Sprint -- have all virtually completed their commonChannel Signaling System 7 networks.andP;  All can deliver the number of thecalling party.andM;MCI has announced this summer it will offer in-band signaling on its 800In-WATS lines.andP;  Elsewhere in this ICA Special are the technical spacs onMCI's in-band signaling.andM;5.andP;  Fractional T-1 finally arrives.andP;  MCI, ATandamp;T and Sprint have announcedfractional T-1 -- multiples of 56 kbps or 64 kbps digital circuits.andP;  What'sbest is that buying fractional T-1 doesn't pose much of a penalty.andP;  Forexample if you buy six digitial circuits (384 kbps), you'll pay roughly 6/24or one quarter of a total T- 1 rate.andM;Previously, you could buy one T-1 or nothing (unless you bought it from oneof the smaller long distance companies).andP;  The availability of bits and piecesof T-1 circuits (pun intended) now means a major boom in applications forsmaller businesses.andM;TELECONNECT could now easily justify fractional T-1 between its New York andSouthampton, PA, offices.andM;6.andP;  T-1 and Ethernet LANs on microwave.andP;  Several companies announced orexpanded short-haul microwave systems, which can carry a T-1 1.6 megabitsignal and an Ethernet LAN signal of 10 megabits.andP;  The idea of a LANtraveling for &quot;free&quot; on a voice-justified short-haul microwave system is veryappealing to many telecom managers.andP;  Or vice versa to data processingnetworks.andM;7.andP;  Multi-vendor network management finally arrives.andP;  Two things created thenetworking boom -- the technology and the accompanying change in the waypeople started doing business.andM;We're no longer a society that simply makes things in a factory, ships themto a retail outlet and then sells them to the consumer.andP;  The so-calledInformation Age has thrown in an extra variable, namely the ability oftechnology to allow us to communicate in such a way as to provide incredibleservice, market out products more effectively, tie in remote areas, solvelogistical problems and generally manage our business.andM;Technology created the Age.andP;  And people were forced to live in it.andP;  There'sno chicken/egg paradox here, folks.andP;  And it has changed the way people dobusiness.andP;  If a company chose not to jump onto this technological bandwagon,they were doomed.andM;Thus, nearly every tape of business has created some sort of informationnetwork that is the very foundation of the way they make money, with the ICAmembers representing the high-end network-based organization and, therefore,the most dependent on its benefits.andM;Today, these big-time information-based companies have turned the tables ontechnology, saying, in effect, OK, you've given me the ability to do thesewonderful things with information and make money, now I need something fromyou -- the ability to manage it all (which means make sure it's working, andfix quickly what isn't).andM;Their problems are twofold.andP;  First, they face one simple truth -- if theycan't manage their network, their network is going to manage them, defeatingthe purpose of the network in the first place, i.e.andP;  making them a betterbusiness.andM;Their second problem is that as the technology became available they oftenadded bits and pieces to their network.andP;  So they're not only faced withdealing with complex and incredibly important monsters -- their networks --but they're looking at a whole that is often comprised of incompatible parts.andO;So the &quot;buzz phrase&quot; is no longer network management, but multi-vendornetwork management.andM;Talk to ICA members about their networks.andP;  They want to know about price.andO;But it's not because they're cheap (they've got bucks to spend).andP;  They justdon't want to junk what they have to switch to a single-vendor solution.andO;They're not stupid.andM;The vendors (the technology itself, in a way) put them in a bit of a jam.andO;Now they want them to get them out of it.andM;Walking around ICA, we were pleased to see that the exhibitors are addressingthis most important issue.andP;  All the biggies -- ATandamp;T, Northern, IBM, DCA, etc.andO;-- are working toward integrated vendor solutions.andP;  It's not quite here yet.andO;We're still talking about a highly competitive industry.andP;  And a &quot;my productis better than theirs&quot; mentality still exists.andP;  And my proprietary protocolis better than your proprietary protocol, etc.andM;But the vendors, like the users, aren't stupid.andP;  They realize what the userswant.andP;  And they are on their way to giving it to them.andM;T-1 For Inbound.andP;  &quot;Seventy percent of our installed base of ACDs (automaticcall distributors) now bring in many of their inbound calls on T-1,&quot; says JimCarreker, president of Aspect, the booming ACD maker in San Jose, CA.andM;&quot;We are replacing inbound voice analog services with T-1 at the rate of onesystem a month.andP;  Why?andP;  Cost savings.andP;  Clarity.andP;  Lack of hassles inattenuation, less noise, etc.andP;  T-1 lines are clean and increasingly cheap.&quot;andM;Attendant Directory System.andP;  Memorex Telex has a great attendant directorysystem.andP;  The thing works with their sleek-looking attendant console.andP;  You getan easy-to-read and incredibly helpful CRT screen that lets you find andextend calls fast and efficiently.andM;Up to 4,000 employees can be in the system.andP;  As soon as your operator entersa name, the department, location and phone number of the employee pops up.andM;Once you find the correct directory entry, a single keystroke (the Enter key)routes the call automatically without any more button-pushing.andM;The program will also search by department, location or number.andP;  If you'renot sure how to spell somebody's name, the first few letters bring you to hisor her vicinity.andP;  Scrolling from there takes care of the rest.andM;And the thing isn't strictly for one building.andP;  It will store and route callsanywhere in the free world.andP;  Each directory entry can store a number up to 23digits to route calls inside or outside the building.andP;  Gives your staffaccess to all the people they need to reach -- employees, suppliers,customers, tenants, etc.andM;The thing also has full messaging -- 50 lines of storage for each directoryentry.andP;  You can also program it so your operators hit &quot;F1&quot; for standardmessages like &quot;Please call back.&quot;andP;  Each message is automatically time anddata stamped.andM;The thing also turns on message waiting lights.andP;  When employees call to gettheir messages, the operator can delete, and/or print the messages.andP;  You canrun it on your PC or theirs.andP;  It connects to the Memorex Telex consolethrough a serial connection -- part of Memorex Telex's open architectureconcepts.andP;  (See above.)andM;It will also work standalone.andP;  You can arm each of your operators with asystem.andP;  The software is only $230.andM;Flexibility andamp; Suttle.andP;  Using Suttle's (Ft.andP;  worth, TX) unique modularapproach you can build your own patch panels to fit your very own wiringneeds.andP;  They can be easily changed and remodeled to fit your needs.andP;  Which isincredibly important.andP;  You know how those things change, don't you?andP;  Wethought you did.andM;On Tape.andP;  Dictaphone's big recording systems are used by banking institutionsto record electronic transactions, by stock brokerages to assure the accuracyof orders, by the FAA to monitor control towers and by police departments tomonitor 911 calls.andP;  They were at ICA.andM;Their Veritrac recording system was responsible for the &quot;actual voices&quot; onthe recent TV show &quot;E911&quot; with William Shatner.andM;Their newest model, the Veritrac Series 9000 features voice-activatedrecording, programmable start and stop times (so you don't record calls afterhours) and time and date on every channel.andM;Power protection.andP;  The Siemon Company has a new UL-approved secondary powerprotection device.andP;  The 230 volt model has already been approved an othervoltages will be available soon.andM;The unit comes with a ground bus assembly with a ground wire to yourbuilding's ground and connections to other units to make sure everything isgrounded properly.andM;The Siemon Company was happy that people stopping by their booth were anxiousto use their products for all the sophisticated connection applications theyare capable of performing.andM;Nationwide Paging.andP;  Nationwide paging is heating up, despite the heavy price($70 or so per month).andP;  There are two major players: National Satellite andMetrocast.andP;  We haven't testdriven Metrocast.andP;  But we like the fact that youcan send more than numbers over their nationwide paging service.andP;  You cansend a message of up to 64 characters to an LCD display on their atttractiveflat pager.andP;  The LCD unit will store up to 40 messages.andM;The market for national paging is not like the market for local pager/beeperservices.andP;  The national pager is for the VIP business person/salesperson onthe road a lot.andM;There are also some interesting short-term urgent needs.andP;  Amy Stanton ofNational Satellite says some interesting applications include people waitingfor organ transplants and expectant fathers.andM;Harry took his National Satellite Skypager to Dallas.andP;  It worked perfectlyfine in and around Dallas and inside the ICA conventional hall.andP;  At $69 amonth in quantities of one, it's not a bad deal if you're working on a &quot;bigdeal,&quot; as Harry was.andM;Meantime, Harry feels National Satellite needs to offer a pager that's more&quot;user friendly&quot; and has more space for more and longer incoming messages,like the Metrocast pager.andP;  They're working on it, they tell us.andM;More ISDN.andP;  BellSouth and Southwestern Bell announced aninterLATA/inter-regional ISDN technical trial between the cities of St.andO;Louis, MO, and Atlanta, GA.andM;They should be up and running in 1992.andP;  The trial will require not onlycompatibility between CO switches from different manufacturers, butconnections to interexchange carriers.andP;  The carriers involved ar MCI and USSprint.andM;Pigtails.andP;  Ever wonder why some coax adaptor/connectors have a short pigtailsbetween the connectors?andP;  It's to prevent damage to valueable computer cards,according to Mod-Tap.andM;Rack mount.andP;  There's no fancy product packaging involved in Centigram'srack-mount version of the VoiceMemo voice processing system -- but thatdoesn't mean that ICA attendees weren't taken by its inner beauty.andP;  It provedto be a very popular product for Centigram.andM;To the point.andP;  The Communications Group, Inc., aka CGI, has a TelephoneManagement System that works on mainframe computers, mini- andmicrocomputers.andP;  They have introduced an interactive service bureau theythink is a real breakthrough.andM;This system travels well too.andP;  It is compatible with many internationalstandards.andM;MPSI.andP;  The 3.0 release of MPSI's A-Plus voice processing system adds andenhances many of the system's features.andP;  The one they are the most excitedabout is scripted prompting.andM;Solid State Systems.andP;  There are big changes over at Solid State Systems,Kennesaw, GA, which is now known as National Telecom Solid State Systems, butwill be National Telecom soon.andP;  The name change reflects their new owner andan expansion of new products.andM;The first new product is the Voicepaq voice messaging system.andP;  It iscompatible with many key systems and has a list price of $3,995, which manypeople at the show told them it was &quot;too cheap.&quot;andP;  The system, which is atwo-port/three hour system, has up to 255 mailboxes, message forwarding userannouncements and telephone answering.andM;There's also a two RS-232-C ports -- one for a printer and one for aterminal, to command the Voicepaq to print reports on the terminal.andM;There's also a renta program to allow their dealers to offer the Voicepaqsystem for less than $ 100 a month.andM;They have begun a consultant liaison program.andP;  They feel the ACD marketrequires experts.andP;  Products sold through consultants will be eligible for anpercentage discount off the standard price.andM;But dealers are not being left out.andP;  The Master Partner Program will givedistributors input into the products they sell.andP;  National Telecom will beginan aggressive ad campaign this month (June).andP;  Other perks include incentivetrips and co-op advertising.andM;Great Peripheral: Perhaps the new best peripheral-type product we saw at ICApractically fell into our laps.andP;  Right next door to our booth was a companycalled Hybrid Fax.andP;  They make a thing called the Jetfax.andM;It's a desktop fax product which delivers plain-paper fax output on a laserprinter, eliminating the need for thermal paper.andP;  They also unveiled theirnew Jetfax Accelerator which dramatically speeds fax printing time.andP;  Listsfor $1,195.andM;We arranged to do a testdrive on the product.andP;  Look for it soon.andP;  Maybe nextmonth.andM;Freestyle.andP;  InteCom's new FreeStyle is a terminal consisting of a stylus(pencil), pad and a telephone-like handset.andP;  It works with their IBXvoice/data PBX to let callers speak to each other and exchange handwrittenmessages over phone lines.andP;  It works with a PC.andP;  While all this other stuffis going on, the PC can be used to share data.andM;Interactive announcer.andP;  The Multi-Line Interactive Plus from Interalia isbrand new.andP;  It can dish out info to 64 callers at the same time.andP;  Callers canchoose from 35 messages.andP;  They can even pikc more than one.andP;  Dealer price is$5,800.andM;LAN UPS:  Network Manager by Minuteman is Para Systems' new software thatinterfaces with your LAN and a Minuteman UPS system for an automatic andorderly network shutdown when power is lost.andM;While the Minuteman supplies temporary battery power to your system, NetworkManager goes to work in notifying all user stations of the power loss andimpending system shutdown before catastrophic data loss occurs.andM;At $199 retail, old hardware can be modified to work with Network Manager.andM;Fujitsu.andP;  Did you know that Fujitsu is the biggest computer company in Japan?andO;That's what David Gould, VP Marketing at Fujitsu tells us.andP;  Fujitsu is busythinking up new applications for their &quot;Imaging Systems&quot; Division (that'swhat they call &quot;fax&quot;).andM;The have played with using fax for sports scheduling, student recruitment andscholarship management for coleges and universities.andP;  In the medical arena,fax has been used to send EKGs from one hospital to another.andM;Gregory Voros, head of Fujitsu Imaging Systems says the future is in marryingportable faxs to cellular phones.andP;  One large moving company already uses thiscombination in their trucks to send pickup and delivery notices, etc.andM;Tigon's Icewalk.andP;  Tigon (Dallas, TX) has set up an 800 number to keep tabs onICEWALK, an eight-man international expendition to the North Pole to focusattention on the earth's deteriorating ozone layer.andM;Employing a new message technology premiered by Tigon, the toll-free numberallows the general public to learn about ICEWALK.andP;  Reports are updatedbi-weekly.andP;  Callers can press &quot;1&quot; for the progress of the journey, &quot;2&quot; for anexplanation of the ozone crisis, and &quot;3&quot; to find out what actions you cantake to stop this insame trend.andP;  The number is 800-999-0029.andP;  Please call it.andM;ICEWALK has three major goals.andP;  The first is to create an internationalawareness of the ozone problem.andP;  Second is to establish an international teamof students to educate their respective peoples on the ozone crisis.andP;  Thethird goal is to establish an international expedition with a common goal --walking toward the North Pole.andM;Tigon, now a wholly owned subsidiary of Ameritech, is a cool company, growing50% a year.andP;  They offer the world's largest &quot;true&quot; voice messaging network.andO;They connect users (at wonderful prices) locally, nationally andinternationally.andP;  Through the network, you can dramatically lower longdistance costs.andP;  And the real beauty is that you have a international andsophisticated voice messaging system that you don't have to deal with.andM;You don't have to buy it.andP;  You don't have to manage it.andP;  You don't have tofix it when it breaks.andP;  That's their problem.andP;  You just have to benefit byit.andP;  Ameritech intends to make the company grow even faster.andP;  Look for amajor media push.andM;Bumper to Bumper: Microvoice is a voice processing company based in Irvine,CA.andP;  Their big news at the show was a two year, no strings attached warrantyon their Apex system.andP;  If the system fails within the first two years, theywill repair or replace it.andM;No fine print.andM;They also have a new four-port system available under 10 grand.andP;  It's a sleeklooking box and completely solid state.andP;  Offers remote programming andmaintenance to boot.andM;Magic: Beside their excellent resident magician, Tim Conover, NewbridgeNetworks was showing off their exciting family to network managementproducts.andM;The 401 MainStreet Network Manager system gives one a center-weightedapproach to managing networks.andP;  It allows you to control, maintain andmeasure the performance of any network from a single site.andP;  It provides theconvenience and power of single point control.andM;Calls can be rapidly rerouted around failed links or nodes, often withoutnetwork users being aware of a problem.andP;  It controls any network constructedwith Newbridge's digital network products: the 3600 MainStreet bandwidthmanager; the 3624 MainStreet intelligent T-1 channel bank; and he 3630MainStreet primary rate mux.andM;The management package fits the needs of a range of networks, from smallpoint-to-point applications through large networks of up to 35 nodes.andP;  Likethey say, you'll wonder how you managed without it.andM;Short-Haul Microwave: At least three companies -- M/A-Com (Chelmsford, MA),Motorola (Schaumburg, IL) and Microwave Networks (Houston, TX) -- have nowintroduced microwave radios that will transmit an Ethernet LAN signal of 10megabits per second.andM;Two of the companies -- M/A-Com (Chelmsford, MA), Motorola (Schaumburg, IL)-- have radios that will transmit T-1 and Ethernet LAN.andP;  The concept is youget either as a &quot;bonus.&quot;andP;  Motorola also has a radio that will transmit T-1and a 4 megabit per second token ring signal.andM;The prices vary betwee $15,000 and $30,000 for the radio.andP;  The rest of thestuff, like channel banks and LAN bridges costs extra.andM;ISDN Roundup.andP;  TELECONNECT apologizes.andP;  Despite running extra pages for thisICA Roundup, we ran out of space.andP;  Our &quot;Big ISDN ICA Show Roundup&quot; will runnext month.andP;  We figured it could wait.andP;  ISDN is hot.andP;  But not that hot.andM;Another Good Install Company.andP;  Wiremold (West Hartford, CT) was at the showas well.andP;  They make what seemed like a zillion different electrical installgizmos.andP;  We really like their line of plug-in outlet centers, particularlythe new Sentrex surge and noise suppressors.andP;  See the install section forfurther poop.andM;We can certainly use some of those units around here.andP;  Hint, hint.andM;Microwave Networks was showing off their neat new version of their MicroNetEthernet LAN radio that has encryption and all bridging functions necessaryto connect Ethernet segments.andP;  Obviously, with the rash of hackers out there,encryption and the security it brings is a good thing.andP;  And not just for themilitary.andP;  Microwave Networks tells us that most of users at the showdemanded security for their microwave short haul applications.andM;The intelligent LAN microwave links from 15 GHz to 23 GHZ.andP;  The DESencryption is built directly into the MicroNet Radio Interface to ensurecomplete privacy on Ethernet networks at all times.andP;  There's a port on theback of the interface where you run a CRT off for nice network managementcapabilities.andM;Diplomat's Baby Brother.andP;  SoftCom came out with a small version of theirDiplomat voice processing system at the show.andP;  It's called the Atache.andP;  Ascrack staff-member Jane Krizman told us at their booth, &quot;Now we addresseveryone!&quot;andM;The system starts as small as two ports with 1.5 hours of storage and growsto six ports and 11 hours of storage.andP;  In contrast, Diplomat begins at fourports/3.5 hours of storage and grows to 24 ports/33 hours.andM;Like many of the voice processing systems out there, the product feeds offone of Dialogic's very reliable speech boards.andM;Excellent New Centrex CPE: Comdial was showing off their new CentraTechsystem.andP;  It can monitor up to 96 Centrex lines.andP;  They are very excited aboutit.andP;  They have reason.andP;  Here's what it gives you.andM;* Monitoring Positions -- A maximum of six integrated attendant positions,using ExecuTech LCD phones and consoles.andP;  Two positions provide full callcoverage and back up for all ExecuTech and Centrex lines, each using one ortwo 70-button DSS/BLF consoles.andP;  The remaining four provide departmental callcoverage, each using a single 32-button DSS/BLF console.andP;  All consoles areheadset compatible.andM;* Loops and Lines -- Up to 22 Centrex loops/lines can be terminated on eachCentraTech and used for call processing.andM;* Centrex Lines -- Attendants monitor and message up to 96 Centrex linesusing standard 2500 sets or any other analog station equipment, including theComdial Maxplus and Sole II families of phones, 1A2, etc.andM;* Multi-Line Phones -- Up to 30 ExecuTech multi-line feature phones can beinstalled on the Centrex lines not needed for loops, providing advancedelectronic phone performance for busy stations.andP;  Features include autodialand TAP (Timed Access Pause) button for simplified access of Centrex systemfeatures.andM;* A Host of Special Call Processing Benefits -- These include: an answer key,allowing the attendant to seize a ringing line simply by pressing one key;fast transfer, alleviating the attendant from waiting on the line until theCO switch has completed the transfer to a system extension; group transfer,providing one-button transfer of calls to a department, with automaticselection of an available line; release key, allowing the attendant torelease calls with a single key; programmable ringing, so that calls toCentrex lines may ring at an attendant position immediately or after aprogrammed ring delay time; queuing, wherein incoming calls can be answeredon a first-in, first-out basis or categorized by four priority levels;messaging from attendant, where he/she can signal a &quot;message waiting&quot;condition to an ExecuTech station or any appropriately-equipped Maxplusterminal; messaging to attendant so that all stations (including 2500 sets)can send up to 10 preprogrammed messages to appear on the attendant's LCDpanel when calls are monitored for those stations; alternate mode, allowingall attendant functions to be transferred from any monitoring positions to aselected alternate position; and overlow mode, when a monitoring position hasmore incoming calls than its programmed limit, the system automaticallyroutes additional calls to a pre-programmed overflow position.andM;* Still More Added Benefits -- Like: LCD features; special Centrex dialing;SMDR; and remote programming.andP;  And it's all made right here in the good ol'United States of America.andM;Call Comdial on 1-800-342-1432 for more poop on this fabulous new system.andM;Walker's 3M FaxXchange.andP;  As voice mail is to phone calls, so FaxXchange is tofacsimile messages.andP;  Think of all the things you can do with voice mail --receive a message, store it, distribute it, broadcast it -- you can now dowith this FaxXchange.andP;  Originally invented by 3M, it is now being distributedby a new division of Walker Telecommunications Corp, Hauppauge, NY.andM;The idea is simple.andP;  You're a fax machine, either a stationary one or aportable one.andP;  A fax comes in for you at the FaxXchange.andP;  You call it up.andP;  Doyou have a fax?andP;  You download the fax, as you would a voice message, repletewith all the levels of security you expect from voice mail.andM;Every fax has a fax &quot;box&quot; on the FaxXchange.andP;  You can send one fax to the boxand ask it to distribute (i.e.andP;  broadcast) the fax to people on yourbroadcast list.andM;FaxXchange has up to 10,000 mailboxes and nine levels or priority.andP;  For an8-port system you're talking $60K to $100K.andP;  The man in charge is ReneValverde.andP;  Remember him from Mitel?andM;Memorex TelexSecret.andP;  &quot;We may be the best-kept PBX secret at the show,&quot; saidHoward Bubb, VP and general manager of Memorex Telex, Camarillo, CA.andP;  as heproudly introduced the Lexar System 2000, capable of supporting 16,000 ports.andM;&quot;Now we have a full line that goes from our VS with 40 to 256 ports rightthrough to our XL with up to 16,384 ports.andP;  What's best is that our newRelease 8.0 software runs on everything from VS to XL.andP;  This means softwareconsistent across all the products.andP;  One single software for all customers.andO;We simply turn on remotely what we need of the software.andP;  All systems willhave all the software.andM;&quot;We have 1,400 systems installed, with over 300,000 phones.andP;  All software onall our systems is upgradable for a nominal fee.andP;  We believe in looking afterour customers.&quot;andM;Several things impress us at TELECONNECT about Memorex Telex.andP;  First, theconsistency of product design throughout the product line.andP;  Unlike many othermajor PBX makers, Memorex Telex has one product design team, ensuringimportant consistencies, like all phones and all software working across theentire product line.andM;There are many examples in our industry of inconsistencies.andP;  Rolm's smallRedwood is 8-bit digital; Rolm's mid-size CBX is 12-bit; the 9751 is 8-bit.andM;ATandamp;T's small and large Merlin key systems are different.andP;  Same thing happenedon the System 75 and 85.andP;  Bringing their technologies together meant a majoreffort, resulting in the recent release of the impressive ATandamp;T Definitysystem.andM;Why many large companies don't have the consistency of Vision that MemorexTelex (and Northern with its SL-1) seems to have a difficult to answer.andP;  Oneguesses We guess it has something to do with their desire to get to marketfast.andP;  They assign different parts of the product line to different (and thuscompeting) product groups and they don't (or can't) lay down precise laws tofollow.andM;Second thing we like about the Memorex Telex stuff is the price of theirphones -- suggested list of $100 at the low end to $520 fully loaded.andP;  It'sthe reason 90% to 95% of their installed base have electronic digital phones.andO;Proprietary phones typically work better behind a PBX.andM;Third, the ability of Memorex Telex's electronic phones to mimic two-linephones.andP;  The company puts a lot its PBXs into hotels.andP;  Having two lines ineach room is important to &quot;upscale&quot; hotels like the Fairmont group.andP;  Memorexjust won a contract to put their PBX into the San Francisco Fairmont.andP;  ForMemorex, it's an 1,800 digital-port system.andP;  To achieve the same size, otherPBX companies bidding on the deal had to propose a 3,600-line switch, twicethe size.andM;Fourth, the company seems to have a nice tenant services package and is neckand neck and leader with ATandamp;T in the shared tenant services business in theU.S.andP;  (Nope, it has't gone away.andP;  There's still a dollar to be made in thatbusinesS.andP;  It's just become a little more mature.)andM;&quot;Free Five-Minute Phone Call To Anywhere in the World.&quot;andP;  Sprint is givingaway calls.andP;  Two oriental gentlemen were in the Sprint phone booth making acall.andP;  &quot;To where?&quot;andP;  I asked the Sprint salesman.andP;  He said proudly, &quot;They'reprobably calling the orient.andP;  The Sprint salesman.andP;  He said proudly, &quot;They'reprobably calling the orient.andP;  The Sprint phone works anywhere in the world,you know.&quot;andM;I popped my head into the phone booth.andP;  Where were they were calling?andP;  Thegentlemen were calling &quot;Wash-ington, DC,&quot; they told me.andP;  They smiled.andP;  Then Inoticed they were wearing ATandamp;T badges.andM;ATandamp;T employees cadging a free $1.50 call from Sprint.andP;  Delicious!andM;P.S.andP;  MCI also gave away long distance calls.andP;  They, like Sprint's, attractedlong lines.andP;  Good quality, also.andP;  We cadged calls off both.andM;IBM andamp;ISDN:  &quot;IBM will continue to contribute to ISDN's evolution and toassess both the benefits to the customer and the work needed to achieve thosebenefits.andP;  We expect to have products available when customers are in aposition to take full advantage of the benefits of ISDN.&quot;andM;This according to a brochure IBM handed out in the press room at ICA.andM;Video-conferencing Boom.andP;  After watching and studying the manyvideo-conferencing demos at ICA, here's some of the things we learned:andM;The two companies dominating the show were PictureTel (Peabody, MA) andCompression Labs (San Jose).andM;Both use two switched 56 kbps digital circuits.andP;  Together these two circuitswill cost about $18 to $30 an hour, which is incredibly cheap and about 75%reduced on what it was earlier this year.andM;The killer is the digital local loops necessary at either end.andP;  The BOCstypically charge $800 a month for the loops.andP;  However, if you have otherservices from your long distance carrier, you can bundle these switchedcircuits with those and bring them in bundled on a T-1 loop -- on cable ormicrowave bypass.andM;The quality of both equipment is excellent.andP;  The control panels on bothsystems are very simple to use.andP;  The equipment costs about $50,000 at eachend -- or $100,000 for a total two-way system.andP;  There's a slight differencein philosophy between the companies.andP;  For example, PictureTel believes in onescreen with a window.andP;  Compression Labs likes two screens.andM;A less expensive video-conference was from Concept (Dallas, TX) with aPC-based video system.andP;  One end of the hop costs $15,000.andP;  That includes thecard with the codec and all the transmission stuff, the camera and themonitor.andP;  It works with one 56 Kbps circuit (but looks much better withmultiple 56 kbps circuits).andM;For the first time, normal people can set up, run and tera down their ownvideo-conference call.andP;  You don't need the dedicated AV tech we have today.andO;Our conclusion: video is now a real tool.andP;  It will explode.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
